AB The process of adiabatic bubble formation from an orifice plate occurs in various industrial applications. It is important to understand the dynamics of bubble formation and to develop numerical models to accurately predict the formation dynamics under various operating conditions. For the numerical models, an appropriate contact line boundary condition is necessary since this process may involve a moving contact line, which significantly affects the bubble departure size. In this paper, we extend the Local Front Reconstruction Method by incorporating contact angle dynamics. The predictions of the improved model are extensively verified and validated with experimental and numerical data available in the literature. The problem of three-dimensional bubble injection from an orifice into quiescent water using various volumetric flow rates is used to assess the numerical model under capillary dominant conditions and conditions where the interplay between inertial, viscous, surface tension, and buoyancy forces cause a complex interface deformation.

AB This paper focuses on the preparation and characterization of CaO, MgO and ZnO, both bulk and supported on gamma-Al2O3 and their catalytic activity in the transesterification of soybean oil and castor oil with methanol and butanol in order to produce biodiesel. XRD, SEM, CO2-adsorption followed by TGA and N-2 adsorption have been employed to characterize the prepared catalysts. In supported catalysts, the presence of c-Al2O3 improves alcohol dissociation on the superficial basic sites. The first step of the reaction mechanism is then favored (hydrogen abstraction). In the transesterification of castor oil with butanol, MgO/gamma-Al2O3 and ZnO/gamma-Al2O3 catalysts showed high yields to FABE (Fatty Acid Butyl Ester) (97% and 85%, respectively). These last catalysts constitute an efficient alternative for obtaining second-generation biodiesel, taking into account that castor oil is a nonedible source and butanol is an alcohol that can be obtained from biomass.

AB Process optimization and control rely highly on system modeling. A reliable model must be formulated with estimable parameters in order to closely predict system behavior in the operating domain. This paper focuses on the modeling and parameter estimation of organic solid-liquid reactions in batch reactors with limited lab-scale experimental data and industrial-scale plant data. Two possible mechanisms, shrinking particle model and dissolution model, are reviewed. A uniform dynamic model with a model indicating factor and several lumped parameters is developed for both mechanisms. A Bayesian estimation procedure is discussed and implemented to select an estimable parameter set, simplify the system model, obtain prior information and determine posterior parameter values. The quality of estimation results is analyzed and enhanced by examining the parameter covariance matrix at the optimal point. In the case of multiple candidate process models, model discrimination is then performed to choose the best representative one by comparing posterior probability shares. Finally, the selected model is validated and tested.

AB The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can induce oxidative damage which can be detrimental to microbial biomass and product yields. In this study, we used intermittent hypoxic stress (IHS) to eliminate the main source of ROS during the production of arachidonic acid (ARA)-rich lipids by Mortierella alpina. Biomass, lipid- and ARA concentration simultaneously reached their peak values, and the ARA yield increased by about 20% along with a lower level of ROS concentration. Under these conditions, more NADPH, substrate and energy may be available for lipid biosynthesis. The efficacy of this strategy was also confirmed in a bioreactor, with similar results. Interestingly, the total power required for stirring fell by about 4%, which may be of practical value for energy savings. This work offers new insights into the control of ROS generation in M. alpina and might be applicable to other microbial PUFAs producers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Palladium-platinum bimetallic catalysts are known for high activity in methane combustion, with phase transformations and structural changes occurring in a high-temperature oxidative atmosphere. Previous research has typically dealt with reaction temperatures exceeding those of the natural gas vehicle (NGV) exhaust, especially for lean burn engines, and often in the absence of water. This study evaluates the effect of the Pd:Pt ratio (from 5:1, 4:1, ... to 1:4, 1:5) on the Pd-Pt/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst stability during and after 40-h in situ hydrothermal ageing at 400-550 degrees C (5% water). Pt presence at Pd-Pt 1:1 to 4:1 ratios is found to be optimal from the viewpoint of activity, with the most stable formulation being a 1:1 Pd-Pt catalyst. Platinum excess above a 1:1 ratio suppresses deactivation at 400 degrees C, but at lower activity levels. The effect is not governed significantly by the particle size but by the ratio of Pd: Pt. The comparative experiments performed with Pd core-Pt shell nanoparticles, co-deposited monometallic particles and monometallic mixed supported catalysts, along with EDX mapping of the used catalysts, suggest significant structural changes when such particles progressively transform into alloyed structures, with activity and stability approaching those of the alloyed nanoparticles. The results suggest that platinum vaporization is significant in the wet feed at low surface oxygen concentrations, even at the temperature interval of 400-550 degrees C. It appears that the proper Pd-Pt metal ratio has a governing effect on the activity and stable behaviour in wet low-temperature methane combustion rather than the catalyst preparation method.

AB The synergistic effects of gas agitation and ultrasound on mass transfer between immiscible liquids were investigated in an in-house made ultrasonic microreactor. With the introduction of inert gas (N-2), a three-phase slug flow with slug bubbles either dispersed in continuous aqueous phase or encapsulated in oil plugs was observed. Under ultrasound irradiation, slug bubbles underwent surface wave oscillation and induced agitation in microchannel. In addition, microbubbles were generated by acoustic cavitation, oscillating intensely and resulting in the formation of O/W emulsion. Bubble oscillation (i.e., slug bubbles and microbubbles) as well as emulsification promoted liquid-liquid mass transfer significantly. Extraction of vanillin from aqueous solution to toluene was employed to demonstrate the mass transfer enhancement. Compared with silent operation, both mass transfer coefficient and extraction efficiency were largely improved by the combined use of gas agitation and ultrasound. With gas flow velocity being 0.005-0.083 m/s at fixed ultrasound power of 30 W, the overall mass transfer coefficients ranged from 0.047 s(-1) to 0.429 s(-1), which was 2.33-17.20 times larger than the corresponding liquid-liquid two-phase process without ultrasound irradiation.

AB Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) with high thermal conductivity is potentially an effective catalyst for highly exothermic propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction. Here, we report our experimental and theoretic studies of such a catalyst for propane ODH in a fixed-bed reactor. Based on the computational fluid dynamics calculation (CFD) results, the catalyst bed temperature increases by less than 1 degrees C in the h-BN catalyst bed which is much smaller than that (8 degrees C) in the VOx/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst bed at a similar propane conversion (25%) using a micro-tubular reactor with a diameter of 6 mm. Even in an industrially relevant reactor with an inner diameter of 60 mm, a uniform temperature profile can still be maintained using the h-BN catalyst bed due to its excellent thermal conductivity as opposed to a temperature gradient of 47 degrees C in the VOx/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst bed. The results reported here provide useful information for potential application of h-BN catalyst in propane ODH. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of the presence of the vertical internals of different sizes at a wide range of superficial gas velocity on the overall, local gas holdup distributions and their profiles have been studied and quantified in a 6-in. (0.14 m) Plexiglas (R) bubble column with air-water system using a non-invasive advanced gamma-ray computed tomography (CT) technique. In this study, two sizes of Plexiglas (R) vertical internals, having the same occupying area (similar to 25%) of the column's cross-sectional area (CSA) that represents those used in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, have been used within a range of superficial gas velocities that cover bubbly and churn turbulent flow regimes (0.05-0.45 m/s). The reconstructed CT scan images revealed that the bubble columns equipped with or without internals displayed a uniform cross-sectional gas holdup distribution (symmetric) for all studied superficial gas velocities. However, the bubble column equipped with 1-in. vertical internals exhibited more uniform gas holdup distribution than the column with 0.5-in. internals. Also, the visualization of the gas-liquid distributions for bubble columns with and without internals reveal that the well-known phenomenon of the core-annular liquid circulation pattern that observed in the bubble column without internals still exists in bubble column packed densely with vertical internals. Moreover, a remarkable increase in the gas holdup values at the wall region was achieved in the churn turbulent flow regime based on the insertion of the vertical internals inside the column as compared with using a bubble column without obstacles. Furthermore, the values of the gas holdup in the core region of the bubble column with vertical internals are similar to those of the bubble column without vertical internals when they are operated at high superficial gas velocity (churn turbulent flow regime), based on the free cross-sectional area (CSA) for the flow. In general, the magnitude of the gas holdup increased significantly with increasing superficial gas velocity for the bubble columns with and without internals.

AB The startup of distillation columns is one of most difficult operations in the chemical industry. In order to decrease the cost of operation, the startup period is to be shortened through optimizing startup operation policies. The conventional direct setting operating policy for startup is pre-defined but it may be neither optimal in terms of startup time nor does it consider the feasibility of the operation. Moreover, time optimal control does not consider the variability due to the disturbances during the startup which can affect the startup time as well as the energy consumption. This work presents the startup of the distillation column based on economic model predictive control and considers the economics of startup. With the consideration of the dynamic disturbances in the startup of the process, the optimization is evaluated under a probabilistic framework. Case studies on startup control show the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of economic saving. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Mixing mechanisms in a low-sheared inhomogeneous bubble column
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Bubble column; Mixing; Bubble-induced agitation; Buoyancy-driven flow
AB This paper reports an experimental study of the mixing of a passive scalar in a bubble column at high Reynolds number and average gas volume fractions ranging from 2.0% to 7.5%. Starting from a homogeneous bubble column, the bubbly flow is progressively destabilized by imposing a gradient of gas volume fraction at the bottom of the tank. In that way, a single recirculation is produced, which allows to investigate the impact of a large-scale buoyancy-driven flow on the mixing of a passive scalar. It is shown that, as long as the shear-induced turbulence generated by the recirculation is negligible, mixing results from two main mixing mechanisms: the transport by the mean liquid velocity and the mixing induced by the bubbles. While the transport by the liquid recirculation can be accounted for by an advection term, the mixing induced by the bubbles is a diffusive process, the effective diffusivity of which has been measured in a homogeneous bubble column by Almeras et al. (2015). However, once the shear-induced turbulence produced by the shear develops, its role upon the mixing has to be taken into account too. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon nanotube (CNT) was synthesized during combustion in a diesel engine by adding catalyst sources into fuel. Fuel used in this study was a mixture of normal dodecane/ethanol, methyl laurate/ethanol, and 1-decanol/ethanol. The analysis of an exhaust gas using a gas chromatograph revealed that the amount of carbon monoxide was most influential on the CNT formation than other factors such as adiabatic combustion temperatures and/or the amount of low molecular weight hydrocarbons like acetylene and ethylene. The significance of carbon monoxide in our system was also suggested by simulated and modeling works. Simulations of combustion reactions inside a cylinder were performed through CHEMKIN-PRO software for a qualitative evaluation. Modeling works of CNT growth rates were carried out by means of not only CO related reactions but also ethylene and acetylene related reactions as a source of carbon deposition. It was suggested that carbon monoxide had stronger connection with CNT synthesis in a diesel engine compared with other potential CNT precursors such as ethylene and acetylene. Furthermore, we proposed CNT growth route in our system by considering characteristics of combustion in a diesel engine. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Potentiostatic anodization of large size titanium electrodes (> 200 cm(2)) has been modeled and validated. During the process, with the development and growth of the TiO2 nanotubes (TiO2-NTs) layer there is a variation in the resistance of the system. A time-dependent model for this parameter is implemented looking for fitting the experimental data of current density with the simulation results. Finally, and more importantly, the model allows obtaining the distribution of oxidized titanium mass in the surface of the electrode. Although in this case the geometry of the anodized titanium plate is quite simple, the same procedure can be applied for the anodization of more complicated electrodes. Consequently, it is possible to evaluate whether the distribution of TiO2 structures with the electrochemical anodization procedure is adequate or not without carrying out the expensive and time-consuming experimental research stage.

ID SIMULATION; TURBULENCE; MODELS
AB This note highlights the subtle difference between two measures of fluctuating kinetic energy of the particulate phase in gas-solids flow. One measure arises from kinetic theory, here identified as granular temperature (T), and a second measure resulting from a spatial average, here denoted kappa. Somewhat surprisingly, continuum models derived from a kinetic theory considering a single, scalar granular temperature, which is further assumed to be isotropic, is still able to predict anisotropic spatially averaged fluctuating kinetic energies. Furthermore, the scale dependence of the spatially averaged can also be extracted. Comparisons of the continuum predictions to recent direct numerical data are striking, particularly for larger averaging volumes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Modelling bubble columns operating in the churn turbulent flow regime is a considerable challenge due to their complex and transient behaviour. A key modelling decision is how best to model the bubble size distribution, with a range of approaches existing from the relatively simple option of using a single, representative bubble size to more complex population balance approaches. In this comparative study, we have examined various approaches (i.e. constant and variable single bubble size models, dual bubble size models, and both homogeneous and inhomogeneous MUSIG models). Model predictions were compared with experimental data from three different configurations of a pilot-scale column (0.39 m in diameter and 2 m in height) operated at industrially relevant superficial gas velocities of 0.16 and 0.25 m s(-1). The single bubble size models gave reasonable agreement with experimental data for the 'symmetrical' configuration, with the variable bubble size model having the major advantage of providing acceptable predictions of the mean bubble size (without this having to be provided as a model input). Implementation of multiple bubble size models did not lead to any substantial improvement in the modelling fit with the experimental data, leading to the inescapable conclusion that the standard bubble breakup and coalescence kernels proposed in the literature do not adequately describe bubble transformations taking place under heterogeneous operating conditions.

ID FREE-SURFACE FLOWS; LIQUID JET; DYNAMICS; BREAKUP
AB A drop-on-demand liquid dispensing system, based on a rotary piston pump, for delivering microlitre droplets at similar to 10 Hz is analysed. Five types of drop formation are observed under different pump operation schemes, characterised by the breakup behaviour of the thin liquid ligament that develops between the forming drop and the liquid remaining at the dispensing nozzle. A range of control parameters and fluids (Newtonian and non-Newtonian) have been explored in order to identify key system parameters for precise satellite-free drop formation and hence to establish an operating window. Under a conventional 'one-step-ejection' pump operation cycle, the window for satellite-free drop production is found to be small and impractical due to the long ligament and large pendant drop at the nozzle. The satellite-free operating window can be expanded dramatically with the ligament and pendant drop size under control with a novel 'two-step-ejection' process, in which the drop is first partly grown, then allowed to settle, and then ejected via a second pulse of liquid from the pump. Rapid deceleration of the pump near the maximum flow rate at the end of the second pulse is essential for satellite-free drop production. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) was used to investigate the diffusion of propane in zeolite ZSM-5 under static and macroscopic flow conditions. The rate of self-diffusion in the adsorbed phase was slightly faster under the flow conditions studied. Control measurements showed that the broadening seen in the quasielastic signal must result from propane condensed in the zeolitic pore and not from gas, either in the bulk or inter-particle voids.

AB In contrast to materials properties, particle characteristics such as size, specific surface area, degree of agglomeration or crystallinity can be directly controlled by the synthesis process and also be determined experimentally without or with minimal further processing. Although particle characteristics only indirectly influence the (extrinsic) materials properties such as processability or charge carrier mobility and lifetime, they are key parameters to improve materials or device performance in applications. Process parameters-especially the time-temperature-profile in gas phase synthesis-control these nanoparticle characteristics. In this contribution a novel method is presented to discover paths to optimized nanoparticle characteristics in chemical vapor synthesis. As examples, physically realistic time-temperature profiles are predicted for a minimized degree of agglomeration at a desired primary particle size and a maximized degree of crystallinity at a desired specific surface area for the case of titania. The method relies on the integration of a simple model describing particle formation and growth into a Monte Carlo optimization algorithm. The results are surprising but can be rationalized using our understanding of particle formation and growth. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The characterization of two-phase flow in both vertical and horizontal pipes is important in oil/gas transportation. As the pipe orientation may change from well to well, it is also important to understand the characteristic responses expected of a two-phase mixture to a change in pipe inclination. This study concerns the changes in the void fraction, structure frequency and structure velocity that occur within an air-silicone oil mixture as a function of the pipe orientation. Experimental data were obtained from the combined use of electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) and wire mesh sensors (WMS), which allow the 3D visualization of the flow patterns. The reported experiments were performed on a 67 mm diameter pipe, in a flow loop, in which a pipe section may be inclined at angles of between -5 or 90 degrees to the horizontal. For this study, the inclined pipe was either set at an angle of 0 or 90 to the horizontal, which correspond to a horizontal or vertical pipe setting, respectively. The results of flow development using the PDF of void fraction obtained at 3 measurement locations; ECT 1, ECT 2 and WMS at 4.4, 4.489 and 4.92 m, respectively, showed that the flow is fully developed and statistically stable for the vertical two-phase flow. While on the other hand, the flow is in rapid development for the horizontal two-phase flow scenario at same liquid and gas superficial velocities. The processed data reveal the differences in flow distribution produced by the pipe inclination. Within the vertical pipe configuration spherical cap bubbles, slug and churn two phase flow patterns were observed, whilst plug, slug and stratified wavy two-phase flows were identified in the horizontal configuration of the pipe. It is concluded that a plot of mixture superficial velocity against average void fraction may be used to provide a qualitative assessment of the flow patterns observed, regardless of pipe inclination. The two-phase flow variables that are concluded to significantly influence the distribution coefficient, C-0, and drift velocity, V-D, are the pipe orientation and flow patterns.

AB Solids Residence Time Distribution (RTD) in Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) risers has received increasing attention due to its vital role in determining the operating condition, particle property, and reactor geometry in industrial CFB applications. In recent years, various solids RTD experimental techniques and theoretical models have been utilized and proposed to study CFB risers. Some controversial issues, however, also arose in the open publications. By means of exploring the advantages and disadvantages of each available RTD experimental technique and model when they are applied to particles in CFB risers, this study discussed the primary causes leading to the huge discrepancy in magnitude of solids dispersion coefficient and Peclet number, which can achieve 4 orders or span from 1 to 100. On the basis of the massive experiment data collected from the literature, the variations of average residence time, Peclet number and dispersion coefficient of solids with superficial gas velocity, solids mass flux and solids concentration were presented. By applying the transition of flow regime in CFB mode, we provided a helpful way to explain some existing contradictions in the reported effects of operating conditions on solids RTD. The possible reasons were also summarized to clarify why some researchers measured a double- or multi-peak solids RTD curve and the others could not in a similar situation.

AB In this work, the photothermal effect based droplet microfluidic system with the incorporation of the rail and anchor is proposed to complete the thermal cycle for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) applications. Using the photothermal effect of the laser enables non-contact control of the droplet temperature with quick response, while the rail and anchor enables precise control of the droplet movement and easy focus on the droplet, respectively. With the proposed droplet microfluidic system, the thermal analysis towards the PCR application is then performed. It is found that when the Biot number of the droplet is less than or equal to 0.1, the uniform temperature distribution in the droplet can be ensured by selecting suitable carrying oil. A linear relationship between the droplet temperature rise and laser power is found, by which each characteristic temperature required in the PCR thermal cycle can be controlled by adjusting the laser power. The minimum temperature response time constant can be as low as about 0.175 s. The first thermal cycle with the consideration of the enzyme activation can be finished in 48.8 s and the following each thermal cycle can be completed in 28.6 s. The results obtained in this work have demonstrated the feasibility of the photothermal effect based droplet microfluidic system for the PCR applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present article focuses on the hydrodynamics of gas-liquid flow through a packed bubble column (PBC) reactor. Typically used in heterogeneously catalyzed gas-liquid reactions, such reactors employ a stationary packing of solid particles (catalyst) through which gas and liquid phases flow concurrently upwards. Designing the reactor to operate in a regime where the overall reaction rate is independent of mixing and mass transfer phenomena is crucial, and an important part of the design is the choice of the packing particle size, D-P. It is well known that liquid-solid mass transfer and intraparticle (void) diffusion limitations drive the choice of the largest acceptable mean particle diameter. In the present work, we provide a condition for smallest acceptable mean particle size based on the consideration of gas-liquid mass transfer. Using experiments in a 10" diameter PBC apparatus and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, we demonstrate that this condition is related to a balance between bubble buoyancy and surface tension and is given by D-P > root K sigma(beta(2)rho(l)g) with K approximate to 10.6 and beta approximate to 0.84.

AB The alkylation kinetics of isobutane with 2-butene catalyzed by composite ionic liquid (CIL) was investigated with batch experiments. The optimized reaction time of CIL-catalyzed alkylation was found to be less than 30 s, much shorter than the traditional H2SO4-catalyzed one. Based on the carbonium ion mechanism, the kinetic model was further established, in which the concentration profiles of three groups of key components in alkylates with time can be well predicted, i.e. trimethylpentane (TMPs), dimethylhexanes (DMHs) and heavy ends (HEs). The rate constant related to the formation of TMPs in the CIL alkylation is more than two orders of magnitude larger than that in the H2SO4 alkylation. The enhancement of the rate constants for the CIL alkylation at the macroscopic scale can be ascribed into the higher solvation and diffusion of isobutane in the CIL at the microscopic scale, which is confirmed by the solvation free energy and diffusion coefficient calculation using molecular dynamics simulation. Hopefully, the multi-scale information in this work can bring novel insights into the understanding of CIL-catalyzed alkylation and further the design and optimization of this process.

   Semibatch Recycle Reactor (SBRR); Polyamines
AB A number of reaction processes undergo yield drops since an intermediate target species can further react with one of the reactants generating lower volatility by-products. Such reactions are typically fast and non-selective, so that a gradual conversion of the reactants is recommended because of safety and quality constraints; when dealing with relatively low-volumes of a highly fragmented set of products, a semibatch reactor is normally adopted where the reaction selectivity is increased by increasing the excess of the selective reactant, therefore lowering the plant productivity.
   For increasing the process selectivity without reducing the plant productivity a different reactor configuration has been recently proposed: the so-called semibatch recycle reactor. However, the good performance of this configuration has never been experimentally confirmed.
   In this work, the unselective industrial synthesis of polyamines through alkylation of 1,2-dichloroethane with a diamine has been experimentally investigated both in a standard semibatch reactor as well as in a semibatch recycle reactor, showing that the latter can lead to a significant increase of both the process selectivity and productivity.

AB Understanding the capillary filling of confined water is crucial for a broad range of science and engineering problems. In this study, Lucas-Washburn (LW) theory is revisited by further considering the effective viscosity and slippage to accurately model the capillary filling behaviors in nanopores, where the effective viscosity is investigated by considering the energy barrier induced by pore wall while the true slip is modelled with the wettability by considering the mobility of first-liquid-layer molecules. The proposed model is successfully validated against the published experimental and molecular simulation data. The results show: (1) The effective viscosity of confined water can be several times higher than that of bulk water for a hydrophilic nanopores with a diameter smaller than 10 nm, and the magnitude will decrease with an increasing of contact angle and pore size; (2) the notable interaction potentials induced by Van der Waals' component and hydrophobic component are out to a distance of 2-3 molecular layers from a surface while the decaying of electrostatic component strongly depends on the magnitude of Debye length, which is related to the ionic concentration of solution; (3) the increase of contact angle will mitigate the anomalous degree of capillary filling in nanopores because it will not only strengthen the hydrophobic repulsive interaction but also make the slippage effect more remarkable; (4) compared with the nanoslits, the more noticeable anomalous characteristic will be observed in nanotubes at the same condition, knowing the wettability and geometrical factors of nanoporous media may help us estimate the capillary filling more accurately.

AB A model incorporating the geometry features, transport, and reactions at the crystallite scale is developed to predict the features of a three-way catalyst during cyclic lean and rich conditions. The reactions on the metal crystallite, metal-ceria interface, and ceria surface are considered and the coupling between these reactions and the spillover processes is incorporated. The crystallite-scale model is integrated with the reactor-scale model to predict the experimental concentration profiles for CO oxidation. It is shown that the dependence of oxygen surface diffusivity on temperature can be used to predict the experimental data. It is quantitatively shown that in addition to the active surface area, the interfacial perimeter plays a key role in the spillover and reverse spillover processes. In agreement with the reported trends, the model predicts that the incomplete regeneration of the catalyst at low temperatures is responsible for the low values of oxygen storage capacity. A low but consistent evolution of CO2 occurs for low dispersions in contrast to the high amount of CO2 during the initial few seconds of the rich phase for a high dispersion catalyst. Fundamental insights obtained in the present work are expected to be applicable to other catalysts which involve the spillover effects. To the best of our knowledge, a model which incorporates the geometry features, transport phenomenon and reactions at the crystallite scale and its integration to predict the reactor-scale data under flow conditions for a three-way catalyst has not been reported elsewhere.

AB A concept of microwave-assisted reactive distillation (MARD) processing using microwave heating has been proposed recently. However, there is no report about the continuous experiments to evaluate this process which is more difficult to realize. To carry out this investigation, a DN 100 pilot-scale continuous MARD column has been developed for synthesis of Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DOP), which consists of a 10 kW microwave generator, a cavity and a set of novel equipment used in the microwave field. The experimental results indicate that the esterification performance could be enhanced based on the effects of microwave on the relative volatility to remove water rapidly. This article also describes the results of a modeling study performed to understand the intensification mechanism in continuous MARD process. It points out the trends of both the reactant conversions and the product purities. It is very important to understand the MARD process and design large-scale MARD process for industrial application. This work has been selected by the Editors as a Featured Cover Article for this issue. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Distributions of current density (cd) in a 100 cm(2) single polymer fuel cell have been measured, leading to a 12 x 12 data array. For a freshly matured MEA, the dimensionless distributions have been shown to be of moderate uniformity, whatever the cell current, with average deviations of the dimensionless cd in the range 0.16-0.25 (i.e. cd measured deviated from 16 to 25% from the expected value). More thorough examination of the data acquired showed that the non-uniformity is likely due to maldistribution of the gas in the 23 parallel channels of the multiple serpentine pattern of the commercial bipolar plates. For the sake of comparison, the MEA - including the two GDL was submitted to ageing with a standard cycling protocol (FC_DLC) emulating transportation conditions for 500 h. Characterisation of the cell state of health afterwards revealed visible degradation of the GDL, whereas the catalytic layer and the membrane were little affected. In the aged cell, distributions were shown to be far more non-uniform, with deviations ranging from 0.30 to 0.50: the current distributions were then depending on the cell current density. Presumably, due to the GDL ageing, liquid water produced at high cd, could not be removed efficiently, resulting in very low cd's near the outlet. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Formation of gas bubbles is normal and practically inevitable when fluids are agitated or flow in open containers. The unwanted gas bubbles will damage the product quality, and they are very difficult to be removed from highly viscous fluids. In this paper, the effectiveness of vibration degassing for highly viscous non-Newtonian fluids is investigated using volume of fluid (VOF) model coupled with continuous surface force (CSF) model. The motions of gas bubbles in liquid under vibration are simulated and the effects of various rheological parameters as well as vibration parameters on the degassing rate are studied. The results show that the shear thinning (or thickening) induced by vibration is responsible for the enhancement (or retardation) of degassing rate for non-Newtonian fluids. The more pronounced the non-Newtonian behaviors of fluids are, the greater the effects of vibration on the degassing rate are. The degassing rate is governed by the vibration amplitude and frequency of vibration. However, high frequency or large amplitude vibration may intensify air entrapment and bring new gas bubbles into fluids. Thus, the feasible region of vibration degassing in which the vibration frequency and amplitude don't cause new gas bubbles are further studied. The vibration degassing technology has the added advantage that it does not use intrusive devices to container, nor does it limit the container structure or shape, and thus will find wide applications in laboratory and industrial fields.

AB A flammable gas could be ignited only if its concentration in air is over a threshold concentration, which is known as the lower flammability limit (LFL). Therefore, predicting LFLs of flammable gases is indispensable for safely handling such flammable gases. The Le Chatelier's mixing rule for the LFL is the prevailing method for estimating the LFLs of mixtures with multiple flammable components. In this work, a novel derivation for this rule is proposed based on the threshold temperature concept. It is found that the important assumption required to reach this mixing rule is that the adiabatic flame temperature rises at LFL are approximately the same for each flammable component. As the adiabatic flame temperature rise is in a sense the required energy gap to initiate a combustion, it should not change while adding/removing inert gas into/from the system. Therefore, it is also the required perquisite to predict the LFLs of mertized mixture or the LFLs in oxygen atmosphere. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, the effect of addition of MIL-101(Cr) metal-organic framework (MOF) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) on physicochemical, morphological and CO2/CH4 separation properties of Matrimid was investigated. MIL-101(Cr) micron-sized particles were synthesized and dispersed as filler in Matrimid/ PVDF blended matrix so that a mixed matrix membrane (MMM) was formed. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis were used to characterize the MIL-101(Cr) particles. The Matrimid/PVDF blend membranes were investigated by optical microscopy (OM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared-attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) spectrophotometry. SEM images were employed to characterize the morphology of membranes. Single-gas permeability measurements for prepared membranes were performed and the results showed improvement in gas permeability of fabricated membranes in comparison with the neat Matrimid membrane. The best performance of blend membrane was obtained with 3 wt% of PVDF, leading to increase 29% and 23% in CO2 permeability and CO2/CH4 selectivity, respectively, as compared to the pristine Matrimid. Furthermore, the gas permeability and CO2/CH4 selectivity were improved simultaneously for Matrimid/PVDF/MIL-101 membrane. The CO2 permeability in this membrane increased 102% and 58%, and the ideal selectivity increased 77% and 45% as compared to the neat Matrimid and Matrimid/PVDF(97/3) membranes, respectively.

AB In order to accommodate potential fluctuations of uncertain parameters, a systematic three-stage method for the design of flexible multiperiod heat exchanger networks (HENs) is proposed, which satisfies not only the requirement of the multiperiod operation but also the flexibility of the subperiod operation. In the first stage, an initial multiperiod HEN is constructed based on the synthesis of the single period HEN. In the second stage, the structure and heat transfer area arrangement of the initial multiperiod HEN are modified and optimized by considering both the multiperiod operational characteristics and the subperiod operational flexibilities. In the third stage, the flexibilities of the modified multiperiod HEN in each subperiod are examined and improved by solving a subperiod debottleneclang model. A case study of a HEN in a vacuum gas oil hydrotreating unit is carried out to illustrate the application of the proposed method. Results indicate that the heat transfer areas and total annual cost of the multiperiod HEN will be underestimated if the parametric fluctuations in subperiods are neglected. A cost-effective multiperiod HEN with sufficient flexibility in subperiods can be obtained by using the proposed method when the parametric fluctuations are taken into consideration.

AB A new method has been developed to describe the transport and separation of phenolic compounds in the agitated bulk liquid membrane system (ABLM). The pseudo-thermodynamic network analysis was applied to simulate the solution-diffusion transport of phenol (PH) and p-nitrophenol (PNP) with a fast neutralization reaction in the stripping solution. The comparison of the experimental results in the system: PH, PNP aq. soln. (pH = 2)|cyclohexane|NaOH soln. (pH = 10) with the results of calculations indicate that the model can be successfully applied for prediction of the time dependent PH/PNP separation characteristics of the ABLM system under study. It was found that the separation PH/PNP factor attaining 50 was observed by experiments and calculations. The liquid membrane system can be considered as useful for phenol removal from the mixture with PNP or PNP cleaning as the reagent for its specific applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Oleuropein aglycone is an important antioxidant compound produced during oleuropein hydrolysis, not yet commercially available. Its production from renewable material by green processes is a challenge because it permits waste re-use and low environmental impact. In this work, homemade asymmetric capillary ceramic membranes were used to develop biocatalytic membranes, which were further used to produce oleuropein aglycone from olive leaves and/or commercial oleuropein. Results indicated that the biocatalytic system (containing covalently immobilized beta-glucosidase) promotes the hydrolysis of oleuropein in both monophase and multiphase processes. Furthermore, the multiphase biocatalytic system enables the extraction of the hydrophobic oleuropein aglycone in an organic phase, before its rearrangement in water. This was achieved by the production, of an unstable water-in-oil emulsion (permeate side), on the basis of membrane emulsification process. The intensified biocatalytic/extractor system allowed taking shelter the hydrophobic compound in the organic phase with good efficiency (90%), protecting it from rearrangement. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The liquid-liquid two-phase flow in a coaxial micro-channel was investigated with micro-PIV measurement and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. The velocity distributions inside and outside of droplet were measured simultaneously. Both experimental and simulated results showed that a pair of symmetrical vortices existed during droplet formation process. In addition, a parameter, swirling strength, was employed to characterize the developing vortices throughout the droplet formation process. The effects of physical properties, such as interfacial tension and viscosity, on fluid flow were also discussed. The results showed that the absolute valued swirling strength increased with the decrease of interfacial tension, while decreased with the increase of continuous phase viscosity. The agreement between the experimental and simulation results in various conditions demonstrates that both the micro-PIV measurement and CFD simulation results in this work are reliable.

AB Distillation columns are essential to chemical process industries, and most of them are fitted with cross-flow trays due to their versatility. Since these columns are expensive in terms of cost and energy consumption, an accurate determination of their separation efficiency is a prerequisite to optimization of their performance by design modification and revamping. This would further reduce the extra trays, added to account for the uncertainties, during the column design. There have been several attempts in the past to understand the nature of liquid mixing and flow patterns on the trays through experiments and CFD simulations, and to relate them with their separation efficiency through CFD, empirical and theoretical models. The present work aims at reviewing the experimental and the simulational studies accomplished to characterize the flow and the mixing patterns on column trays. In particular, a comprehensive review of the existing theoretical efficiency prediction models along with the critical analysis of their strengths and weaknesses is presented. The dependence of the tray efficiency on system and flow properties is also discussed. In addition, a concise strategy on how to process and utilize the experimental data in tandem with mathematical models is proposed. The future of the tray efficiency modeling is anticipated to feature hybrid approaches, i.e. using theoretical models supplemented with fluid dynamics information from experimentally validated CFD models. Thus, knowledge of the existing theoretical approaches is imperative for their improvement and development of the new ones for better tray efficiency predictions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), as an emerging land of two-dimensional (2D) materials with large hydrophobic surface and superior mechanical property, holds great promise in preparing high-performance hybrid membranes. In this study, MoS2 nanosheets were embedded within sodium alginate (SA) for ethanol/water separation. Morphology, structure, mechanical and thermal properties of the membranes were characterized. The incorporation of MoS2 nanosheets affected the microstructure of the membranes. The Young's modulus of the as-fabricated hybrid membrane was enhanced by 57%, and the swelling degree was reduced by 33% compared to SA pure membrane. Besides, the ordered stacking of MoS2 nanosheets, as well as their interlayer spacings, provided transport channels for water molecules. The fast transport of water molecules on the MoS2 surface is the reason that an optimum ethanol dehydration performance was achieved when the MoS2 content was 2 wt%. In ethanol/water (90/10 wt%) solution at 350 K, the permeation flux was 1839 g/(m(2) h) (54% higher than that of SA/PAN pure membrane), and the separation factor was 1229 (85% greater than that of SA/PAN pure membrane). Moreover, the hybrid membrane exhibited good long-term operation stability. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of hydrodynamic radius on the transport of solute molecules in packed beds of wide-pore superficially porous particles (SPP) are studied using pore-scale simulation. The free molecular diffusion rate varies with radius through the Stokes-Einstein relation. Lattice Boltzmann and Langevin methods are used to model fluid motion and the transport of an ensemble of solute molecules in the fluid, providing statistics on solute concentration, flux, molecule age and residence time, as a function of depth in the SPP. Intraparticle effective diffusion and bed dispersion coefficients are calculated and correlated with the hydrodynamic radius and accessible porosity.
   The relative importance of convection and diffusion are found to depend on the molecule (tracer) size through the diffusion rate, and convection effects are more significant for larger, slower-diffusing molecules. When larger molecules are utilized, the intraparticle concentration is reduced in proportion to the local particle porosity, leading to a natural definition of the accessible porosity used in size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Although the pore shape is complex, the SEC constant K can be calculated directly from simulation. Simulation demonstrates that the effective diffusion coefficient is elevated near the particle hull, which is largely open to interstitial flow, and decreases with depth into the particle. All molecules studied here have transport access to the entire particle depth, although the accessible volume at a given depth depends on their size. The first passage time into the particle is well predicted by the diffusion rate, but residence time is influenced by convection, shortening the average visit duration. These results are of interest in "perfusion" chromatography where convection is thought to increase separation efficiency for large biomolecules. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Water purification using microbubbles has become an important topic, owing to its enhanced mass transfer effect. Therefore, a full 3D numerical model is developed for wastewater purification using microbubbles with bacterial biochemical reactions. Microbubbles are injected into the bioreactor, and the oxygen obtained from microbubble dissolution is used by the bacteria for substrate consumption. This consumption performance may depend on several factors, including physical parameters such as bubble size, column height, and injection type. Optimization of the bioreactor performance based on these parameters would lead to significantly faster purification. In this study, the dependences of these parameters are investigated numerically. The bioreactor model is provided by the mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation for fluid flow and bubble motion tracking in the system. Mass transfer, gas dissolution, and mixing using the Sherwood number approach are employed in this model. Biochemical reactions based on various literatures, including activated sludge models, are used for the current simulation of wastewater purification. Simulations are carried out for an aerobic bacterial system with carbohydrates as the chemical oxygen demand source. The bioreactor height is varied from 1.1 to 4.1 to the base (similar to 0.1 m), the bubble size is varied from 200 mu m to 1 mm, and the central and uniform injection systems are compared. The analysis demonstrates that, for microbubbles with a uniform injection system, a drastic reduction in bioreactor height can be achieved without a performance reduction. An important conclusion is that, for a shorter bioreactor height with 200 mu m-microbubble injections, the uniform injection system offers significantly superior performance, while for a longer height with larger (500 mu m or 1 mm) bubbles, the central and uniform injections provide nearly the same performance.

AB Modulation of turbulent flow in an oscillating grid system due to controlled release of a bubble train was experimentally investigated using particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique wherein flow field modulation was reported in single bubble resolved manner. The bubble diameter was varied in the range similar to 2.70 to 3.52 mm (similar to 26 to 34 times the single-phase Kolmogorov scale, and similar to 1.05 to 1.35 times the singlephase integral length scale). The two-dimensional (2D) instantaneous velocity fields were obtained for both single-phase and bubble train cases at grid Reynolds numbers (Re-g) ranging from 1080 to 10,800. The modulation of single-phase turbulence due to bubble was analysed based on the turbulence intensity, isotropy ratio (IR), length scales, specific energy dissipation rates and energy spectra. The single-phase turbulence fluctuating velocity increased similar to 5-76% in the inertial subrange region in the presence of bubbles. Presence of bubbles also led to enhancement in the flow field isotropy ratio due to upward acting buoyancy force. It was noted that at high Re-g (6480-10800), the IR value of the flow was found to be more dependent on the grid Reynolds number compared with bubble diameter. The integral length scale of the single-phase flow decreased following a power law dependency over the Re-g. It was found that the specific energy dissipation rate of single-phase flow increased with an increase in bubble diameter. The energy spectra exhibited a slope less steep than -5/3 which indicates the additional turbulence production by the bubbles in the inertial subrange region. Energy transfer augmentation from large scale to small scale due to bubble was explianed by the dissipative spectrum which showed reduction of the energy in the small scale and an enhancement of the energy in both large scale and inertial subrange.

AB The effects of particle roughness and deformability on the fluid dynamics of liquid fluidized beds were investigated using a 190.5-mm-diameter column and particles with different surface finish and stiffness. Glass beads and plastic "BBs" coated using different techniques were employed as the rigid particles, while cooked starch pearls (tapioca) and sodium alginate gel beads produced from different gelling solutions served as the deformable particles. The particles were characterized by measuring their densities, diameters, Young's moduli and coefficients of restitution. Terminal settling velocities were also measured by the free-falling method, and the bed voidages over a wide range of fluid flow rates were estimated from pressure drop measurements along the column height. Correlations for rigid smooth spheres under-estimated the single-particle terminal settling velocity for particles with many asperities, especially for the soft spheres. The Richardson-Zala equation, derived empirically for rigid particles, provided a satisfactory description of the liquid fluidized bed expansion, especially for rigid particles. Although the voidage deviations observed for the soft particles were less than 10%, the fluidization behavior of these particles was affected much more by the particle Stokes number than for rigid spheres. Though there is evidence in the literature that particle surface roughness is responsible for the deviation from predicted bed expansion in the fluidization of bioparticles, results presented in this study indicate that the mechanical properties of these soft particles can also be a major influencing factor.

AB A multi-scale simulation approach was proposed to predict the degree of impregnation (Dol) in thermoplastic unidirectional carbon fiber prepreg (UD-CFP). The multi-scale approach included a two-dimensional (2D) micro-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in a representative elementary volume (REV) of carbon fiber (CF) tow, a 3D macro-scale CFD of an entire impregnation die with 15 sliding CF tows, and a process-scale simulation assembling data from the micro- and macro-scale CFDs. In the macro-scale steady-state CFD, thermoplastic resin injection and CF tow insertion were considered for an impregnation die 10 cm in width. In the micro-scale transient CFD, impregnation mechanisms of resin into CF filaments 7 mu m in diameter were identified in terms of surface coverage, capillary permeation, and penetration through CF filaments. The Dol as a function of pressure and time was obtained from the micro-scale CFD within a range of pressures found in the macro-scale CFD. In the process-scale simulation, the cumulative Dol of the 15 tows was predicted along the impregnation die length with the aid of the micro- and macro-scale CFD results. Combining the multi-scale models gives a potential to predict the uniformity of the transverse resin amount in the final UD-CFP product. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB One-tank molten salt thermochne heat storage system can reduce capital cost due to the use of cheap heat storage materials as compared with two-tank molten salt heat storage system. In order to develop a convenient method for the evaluation and design of the one-tank thermocline heat storage system, the idea of effectiveness-number of transfer unit method (epsilon-NTU) for heat exchanger design was employed in which three dimensionless design parameters are defined including the ratio between overall thermal conductance and the total thermal capacity of heat transfer fluid flowing through the system during discharging process (i.e., NTU), the ratio between thermal capacity of solid particles and total thermal capacity of heat transfer fluid through the system during the discharging process (i.e., C*(s)), the ratio between overall thermal conductance in the charging process and that in the discharging process (i.e., (hA)*). A transient one-dimensional dispersion-concentric model is then applied to study the effects of three dimensionless parameters on the effectiveness of one-tank system. It is shown that the effectiveness of the one-tank thermochne heat storage system is closely related to NTU, C*(s) and (hA)*. Based on the simulated results, general performance evaluation charts and the related effectiveness correlations are also proposed for evaluation and design of the one-tank system. Moreover, the proposed effectiveness correlations are finally applied in the design of a one-tank molten salt thermocline heat storage system in a 50 MWe CSP plant. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Measuring the size of bubbles is of fundamental interest in process engineering, especially in flotation. The size of a bubble influences its rising velocity, coalescence tendency and interaction with particles and surrounding liquid. This paper presents an online Bubble Size Analyzer (BSA) with automated image analysis software. The importance of isokinetic sampling with short residence time in the sampling system is shown. Key parameters of the image analysis software are pointed out. The BSA was used to characterize a laboratory dissolved air flotation setup. In accordance with literature, bubble size reduction with increasing saturation pressure and recycle flow was measured. It was discovered that bubble generation in the flotation setup happened by classical dissolved air flotation only when it was operated with pure water. With sodium chloride saline and complex protein solution a mixed dispersed/dissolved air flotation was observed. Maximum bubble sizes were found in water, reduced sizes in saline and minimum size in protein solution. Due to its flexible online installation, the BSA is recommended as a suitable tool for bubble size measurements in laboratory and real processes, where inline analysis is not possible.

   CHALLENGES; METHODOLOGY; ALGORITHM; FRAMEWORK
AB Process synthesis methods enable the determination of unit operations and their interconnection into a process flowsheet, with associated design and operating parameters, and responding to given objectives. Modern methods are optimization-based, using for example Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) formulation to optimize a process superstructure. Finding an adequate definition of the search space is a non-trivial problem in such approaches, especially when the number of possible combinations is high due to the process complexity, and is mostly driven by expertise (e.g. heuristics). Consequently, an inductive bias is intrinsically introduced due to restriction of a limited search space, such as the choice of a superstructure representing a limited set of process alternatives.
   In this work, an evolutionary method is proposed to generate several process architectures based on a set of available unit operations (and associated models) as elementary building blocks. The procedure is here called ab initio process synthesis since it does not require any pre-defined process structure. The developed method relies on the use of an Evolutionary Programming (EP), mimicking natural evolution at species-level, for the automatic construction of a process by using mutation operators to choose, assemble and connect elementary building blocks (i.e. unit operations). A Non-Linear Programming (NLP) is used for process evaluation, by simultaneously solving balances and optimizing process degrees of freedom.
   The method is implemented in a newly developed tool called PSEvo (Process Synthesis by Evolution). An application to a typical reaction-separation problem is presented, using various problem definitions and evolution control parameters, which demonstrates the method capability to generate optimal processes. The possible uses and the challenges of ab initio process synthesis are finally discussed. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We report the results of an experimental study on the thermal-diffusion mechanisms of particles with fluctuant motion in a dry granular system. Granular beds with different intensities of particle self-diffusion were produced by exerting vertical vibration-driving forces of different strengths. The effective thermal diffusivity, alpha(e), was determined by solving the inverse transient heat conduction problem. The self-diffusion coefficient in the vertical direction, D-yy, was calculated to describe the diffusive motions of the particles in the bed. The dimensionless Lewis number, Le, was calculated to investigate the relationship between mass diffusion and thermal diffusion. First, we demonstrated that mass diffusion increased the thermal-diffusive behavior of the dry granular system. Second, we identified a positive linear correlation with the specific slope S-alpha d between alpha(e) and D-yy. In particular, the value of S-alpha d represents a characteristic of the granular system related to the relationship between thermal diffusivity and the mass diffusivity; this means that Le may approach the value of S-alpha d if the intensity of particle self-diffusion in the bed is sufficiently strong.

AB In this paper, we use a variant of the Extended Kalman filtering (EKF) state estimation technique which is specifically adapted to handle models that are described by differential-algebraic equations (DAE) to estimate the full state vector of a reactive distillation process in a pilot plant. The process model employed in this work is a MESH model (Material, Equilibrium, Summation, Enthalpy or Heat balance) that incorporates several hundred state variables. At the pilot-scale process, the concentration measurements of each product stream of the column (distillate, bottom) can be accessed at a slower sampling rate compared to the temperature and holdup measurements. We have designed and tested the state estimator in simulation studies for a realistic setting and present the results. The state estimator is run online at the column using an OPC-DA (Open Platform Communications Data Access) server for an efficient data exchange between the process control system (PCS), the concentration measurement device based on the nearinfrared (NIR) spectroscopy and the state estimator. Both in theory and in practice, we evaluate the statistical properties of the innovations in order to draw conclusions on the performance of the state estimator. At the pilot-scale reactive distillation process, we tested different operating conditions to demonstrate the reliability of the state estimator. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Molar fluxes inside porous catalysts can be calculated by means of multicomponent diffusion models. The state-of-the-art dusty-gas model competes with several alternatives, best-known the mean-transport pore model and the binary friction model. All three approaches combine Maxwell-Stefan-based transport with Knudsen diffusion and viscous Darcy flow. However, the models have not yet been compared theoretically, when applied to actual diffusion-reaction problems. Here we successively show that these diffusion models result in very similar behavior when applied to C-O2 methanation, methanol synthesis and oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. By comparing molar fractions, temperature and pressure profiles, latter revealed the most striking deviations between the models. Monte-Carlo-based, global sensitivity analyses on the catalyst effectiveness factors exhibit significant impact of catalyst properties, even at low uncertainties. At equal uncertainty levels, highest sensitivity was observed for the pellet porosity, followed by the tortuosity factor and the pore diameter. Overall, the choice of the diffusion model appears to have low influence on the regarded reaction-diffusion models. Hence, we recommend the binary friction model as most reliable, since both other approaches suffer from inconsistencies in the treatment of the viscous flux terms. These findings can be used as valuable basis for modeling multicomponent diffusion inside porous catalysts employed in heterogeneously-catalyzed gas-phase reactions.

AB In order to get a better micromixing performance, an intensification reactor that couples a confined impinging jet reactor and high speed disperser (CIJR-HSD) was designed. The influences of operating and structural parameters on the micromixing performance were investigated by using the iodideiodate reaction system. The results showed that the segregation index decreased with the increase of both the rotational speed and the number of rotors; whilst there was little influence due to both inlet flow rate and the presence of packing. The coupling distance between the centre of the CIJR and the first rotor of the HSD also had a non-negligible effect on segregation index. The micromixing time was determined by the Engulfment model, and could also be evaluated by the energy dissipation model based on fluid energy transformation. It was found that the micromixing time for the CIJR-HSD device was in the range of 0.1-0.3 ms, while that for a single CIJR was in the range of 0.35-0.5 ms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Coarse-grid two-fluid simulation of gas-solid fluidized bed reactors based on the kinetic theory of granular flow exhibits a significant dependence on drag models, especially for Geldart A particles. Many drag models are available in the literature, which have been reported to work for different systems. This study focused on the evaluation of an enhanced filtered drag model along with other different drag models derived from different methods for three-dimensional two-fluid model simulations of gas-solid fluidized beds of Geldart A particles covering a broad range of fluidization regimes, including bubbling fluidization, turbulent fluidization, fast fluidization, and dilute phase transport regimes. Eight drag models were selected, which included five heterogeneous drag models and three homogeneous drag models. Comparison with the available experimental data demonstrates the need for modification of homogeneous drag models to account for the effect of mesoscale structures (i.e., bubbles and clusters). The enhanced filtered drag model and energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) drag models were found to achieve superior predictions in all fluidization regimes, while the other drag models were only capable of predicting certain fluidization regimes. The results of this work provide a guideline for choosing appropriate drag models for simulating Geldart A particles and suggestions on developing more reliable and general drag models applicable in all flow regimes.

AB Highly efficient separation of residual carbon dioxide (CO2) from syngas, mainly composed of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H-2), could not only make its utilization more energetically efficient but also avoid catalysts poisoning in some industrial applications. In the attempts to address this issue, it is acknowledged that CO2/CO separation is the vital step since H-2 is a nonpolar molecules, difficult to be polarized and could be easily separated from CO2. Herein, we report a novel strategy to graft basic ethylenediamine (ED) molecules onto porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as solid adsorbents for CO2/CO separation via solvent 'squeezing' approach, in which Cu-3(BTC)(2) (BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate) MOF was employed as the pristine MOF. Surprisingly, the ED-grafted Cu-3(BTC)(2) shows unprecedented enhancement of CO2/CO selectivity of 226% at 273 K and 861% at 298 K, respectively, in comparison with the solvent-free Cu-3(BTC)(2). Moreover, despite the large isosteric heats of adsorption of CO2 on the ED-grafted Cu-3(BTC)(2), it could be easily regenerated at moderate temperature. This work provides an efficient and facile method to functionalize MOFs for CO2 capture. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The standard two-film theory (STFT) is a diffusion-based mechanism that can be used to describe gas mass transfer across liquid film. Fundamental assumptions of the STFT impose serious limitations on its ability to predict mass transfer coefficients. To better understand gas absorption across liquid film in practical situations, a multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model fully equipped with mass transport and chemistry capabilities has been developed for solvent-based carbon dioxide (CO2) capture to predict the CO2 mass transfer coefficient in a wetted wall column. The hydrodynamics is modeled using a volume of fluid method, and the diffusive and reactive mass transfer between the two phases is modeled by adopting a one-fluid formulation. We demonstrate that the proposed CFD model can naturally account for the influence of many important factors on the overall mass transfer that cannot be quantitatively explained by the STFT, such as the local variation in fluid velocities and properties, flow instabilities, and complex geometries. The CFD model also can predict the local mass transfer coefficient variation along the column height, which the STFT typically does not consider. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB By combining the prominent advantage of directional fluid flow in an internal airlift loop reactor with the cheap cost of liquid-solid separation in a hydrocyclone, a new slurry reactor for process intensification integrating solid catalytic reactions with liquid-solid separation for clear liquid products is proposed and designed to cut down the capital and operating costs. The reactor can be operated properly when the superficial gas velocity is above 0.0108 m/s, and the solid particles of aluminum oxide are all retained in the slurry reactor if the particle diameter is larger than 57.9 mu m. The influences of superficial gas velocity and top clearance on the performance of hydrodynamics and mass transfer in the gas-liquid two-phase and the gas-liquid-solid three-phase systems are measured and discussed systematically, and some data base for the rational design, optimization and scaling-up of this type of promising reactor is provided.

AB The viscosity of ionic liquids (ILs) plays an important role in the chemical industry, material science and environmental science. This work presents a temperature- and pressure-dependent (eta-T-P) model based on the norm indices for describing the viscosity of ILs. While the parameters for the temperature and pressure dependence of the viscosity have been generally set as constants in previous work, they are adjusted based on the molecular structures in the eta-T-P model. Because ILs consist of only cations and anions, the norm indices are derived from cations and anions, respectively. However, the close connection between the interaction of the cations and anions and IL viscosity cannot be neglected; therefore, another set of norms is further deduced to represent the cation-anion interaction. The eta-T-P model is developed using 349 ILs (3228 data points) in the temperature range of 253.15-573.00 K and the pressure range of 0.06-300.00 MPa. Consequently, a eta-T-P model is derived with convincing results, as evaluated by the following statistical parameters: the squared correlation coefficient (R-2), Fisher significance (F) and the overall average absolute relative deviation (AARD), which are 0.964, 1809 and 4.62%, respectively.

AB Increasingly medical diagnostic platforms rely upon the use of colloidal nanoparticles for the detection of biomolecules. Colloids offer greatly increased surface area to volume ratios and lack diffusion limitations that typically reduce reaction rates in assays employing planar surfaces. These characteristics are anticipated to improve the speed to answer as well as the total number of analytes that are captured in colloidal assay systems. This paper details a reaction-diffusion modeling approach to optimize colloidal affinity-based bioassays, with emphasis on the key figures of merit of projected sensitivities and time to answer over a broad range of conditions. The computational results illustrate the intuitive sense that colloidal sensing surfaces have improved kinetics as compared to solid supports, that the curvature of the spherical sensing surface probes a larger volume than a planar surface of the same area resulting in a larger diffusional driving force for reaction to the surface and equilibrium of bound analyte. The governing regime of particle systems skewed toward kinetically limited regimes and multiple configurations of particle diameter and concentration achieved equivalent analyte capture. Surface based sensor platforms have benefited from miniaturization of the capture area and particle capture systems provide a route to further surface miniaturization, as well as unique opportunities for the rapid analysis of dilute samples of particular interest for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics.

AB A novel strategy for a heterogeneous benzylation reaction conducted in a capillary microreactor was proposed. Silica-immobilized FeCl3 nanocatalysts were dispersed in benzyl chloride to form a nanofluid, and then were applied for the benzylation of toluene with benzyl chloride to produce monobenzyl toluene and dibenzyl toluene. The effects of various factors, such as reaction temperature, catalyst composition and residence time on the reaction performance were systematically evaluated. The benzyl chloride conversion could reach 99.2% with the 10%FeCl3-SiO2 catalyst under optimal conditions. Both internal effectiveness factor and external effectiveness factor were estimated to explore the influence of internal diffusion and external diffusion on the reaction performance and to reveal the rate-controlling step during the continuous-flow synthesis. Furthermore, the carbenium ions mechanism was applied to elaborate this heterogeneous benzylation reaction. The nanocatalysts could be regenerated and reused for three times with a high catalytic activity (conversion of benzyl chloride >70%), showing great application potential of this nanofluid catalysis protocol on chemical transformations for fine chemicals syntheses.

AB In this work, we investigate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on Pt(1 1 1), Pt(2 2 1), and Ni/Au1Pt3(2 2 1) surfaces using periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations augmented with kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations. In the DFT calculations, both a uniform electric field and an implicit solvent were employed to quantify the changes in the ORR energetics. Based on the DFT values and the reaction mechanism of ORR, KMC simulations were performed to predict the current densities and the surface populations as a function of the electrode potential on the different catalyst surfaces. These results were compared to an ORR model with energetics approximated using scaling relationships. The two approaches for obtaining energetic parameters yield different KMC-predicted polarization curves. An analysis of the surface species concentrations on Pt(1 1 1), Pt(2 2 1), and Ni/Au1Pt3(2 2 1) indicates dramatic concentration variations at different potentials. Direct neighbor-neighbor interactions on the surface were also tested, but they were found to only moderately influence the surface species concentrations, and they led to imperceptible changes in the predicted current densities. Overall, we predict that an alloy surface of Ni/Au1Pt3(2 21) can significantly shift the onset potential of the polarization curve to higher potentials, providing guidance for future electrocatalyst design.

AB Tissue Engineered Vascular Graft (TEVG) is a promising treatment for cardiovascular diseases because of its potential for repair and long-term patency. However, the quality and preparation time to achieve a mature TEVG has limited its use in clinical settings. Both of these factors can be improved by effectively growing TEVGs with a uniform and high cell density, which is currently limited due to the diffusion limit of oxygen and nutrients. In this paper we propose a novel optimized microchannel geometry in TEVG wall model that facilitates uniform oxygen transport within a simulated TEVG with high cell density. In order to model the oxygen mass transport incompressible Navier-Stokes, convection, and diffusion equations were solved numerically. Furthermore, to model oxygen consumption in the graft domain, Michaelis-Menten kinetics were coupled with the oxygen diffusion equation. Finally, an optimized model was yielded such that nearly four times the cell density can be sustained by using the proposed microchannels design compared to a simulated TEVGs with a solid wall. In addition, to minimize the oxygen gradient along the graft, multiple segments are added to microchannels and their locations along the microchannels are optimized. We believe these simulated results can help guide the design and fabrication of optimized TEVGs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For the two-step chemical reaction A reversible arrow B reversible arrow C, invariant dependences of a new type have been found. These invariants relate concentration dependences which are started from the single component (single-component-dependences). For constructing the invariants, a three-stage procedure is used: 1. Scaled Incremental Conversion (SIC), chi, is determined for any substance as chi = X(t)-X-0/X-eq-X-0, where X-eq and X-0 are equilibrium and initial concentrations for any substance, A, B, or C, respectively; X(t) is the concentration at any moment of time. 2. Differences of SIC terms Delta chi are determined for different pairs of substances. SIC terms are calculated in experiments with symmetrical initial conditions. 3. A generating function of invariants is constructed which produces invariants as ratios of different Delta chi. These ratios remain constant at any time during the non-steady-state reaction. It is demonstrated that the variety of invariants obtained depends on the initial conditions used in the procedure. Explicit analytical expressions have been found assuming the same initial conditions, two, and three different initial conditions, respectively. All invariants are functions of three independent parameters which are ratios of kinetic coefficients. Two of them are equilibrium reaction constants, and the third one is the ratio of kinetic coefficients belonging to different reactions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The thermodynamic behavior of fluids confined in nanopores is highly influenced by the interaction between fluid molecules and pore walls. The most accurate approaches for modeling confined fluids are too computationally demanding for practical engineering requirements, such as process simulation. Thus, several efforts have been made to develop analytical equations of state suitable for confined fluids. The scope of this work consists of a modification to our previous modeling of fluid confinement in cylindrical pores based on cubic equations of state. By using new, more explicit mixing rules, a more consistent description of confined mixtures is obtained. Additionally, this modeling approach is extended to spherical pores. The proposed models displayed good predictive performance for the adsorption of binary and ternary mixtures, based on pure fluid adsorption data only, with an improvement relative to the previous modeling. It is shown that the adopted pore geometry can significantly affect the model performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Molecular dynamics simulations are employed to investigate the aggregation behavior at the late stages of silica production in a colloidal solution to find new insights into the structures and dynamics of the produced aggregates and pores. The implemented theoretical investigations used the Amorphous cell and Forcite modules, and Dreiding force field of Materials Studio package. The key thermodynamic parameters, mean squared displacements, and radial distribution functions were calculated. Results revealed that aggregation occurred in the late stages due to the negative value of Gibbs free energy. Diameters of the generated "aggregates and pores" continuously increased while the number of "aggregates and pores" first increased and then decreased. Furthermore, the volume of pores first rose and then fell as the reaction proceeded. Variations of reactant numbers had the noticeable influence on the pores and aggregates topologies. The number of aggregates and pores had an upward trend while their diameters slightly reduced when more effective molecules were involved in the aggregation process. In addition, the shape of the aggregates examined and found that the predominant shapes of the aggregates were spherical. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Severe slugging is one of the flow assurance concerns in oil and gas industry because of the undesired fluctuations of pressure and flow rates in the system. Knowledge of severe slugging frequency is essential for the receiving facility design. However, unlike the considerable investigations of normal slug frequency in horizontal and inclined pipes, little work has been done to predict severe slugging frequency. In this work, an experimental study of air-water two-phase flow was conducted in a long pipeline-riser system. According to the riser pressure drop signals and the power spectral density (PSD) distributions, flow patterns were classified into classical severe slugging, transitional severe slugging, oscillating flow and stable flow. The effect of riser-top choking on classical and transitional severe slugging frequency were analyzed. Based on a broad range experimental database from ten flow loops, the effect of dimensionless pipeline length on severe slugging frequency was analyzed and an empirical correlation was developed to predict severe slugging frequency. Good matches with literature data demonstrated the validation of the empirical correlation. The severe slugging frequency correlation was applied to predict severe slugging length and derive a new transition criterion between classical severe slugging and transitional severe slugging in the flow pattern map.

AB The simulation of bubble columns operating under the heterogeneous regime is an ambitious challenge, due to the difficulty of predicting accurately hydrodynamics and bubble size distributions, that requires experimental data for model validation. Gas fraction distributions, liquid and gas velocity profiles and bubble size distributions across bubble columns are deeply interconnected in these systems and only a comprehensive study allows the links between them to be understood. This work reports experimental data obtained by measuring bubble sizes with an innovative technique based on the cross correlation between two optical probes. Particular attention is given to the role of additives and impurities with a view to suppressing bubble coalescence. Initially experiments are carried out with demineralized water; subsequently they are repeated with tap water and adding small quantities of ethanol. Results show that contaminants and alcohol addition suppress bubble coalescence and induces a decrease of mean bubble sizes. Furthermore, alcohol addition delays the transition from homogeneous to heterogeneous regimes and increases the gas hold-up under the heterogeneous regime. Gas distribution is studied through two different perforated spargers. Changing the sparger it is possible to modify the bubble size in the lowest part of the column significantly. A perforated sparger with big holes causes the formation of big bubbles close to the holes of the sparger and promotes bubble breakage in the lower part of the column. By combining ethanol addition and sparger modification, bubble coalescence and bubble breakage can be decoupled in a controlled manner and interesting conclusions concerning these processes can be drawn. Beyond the novelty of bubble size measurements at high gas fraction, the experimental data collected are very useful to validate and develop computational fluid dynamics simulations coupled with population balance models suitable for heterogeneous bubbly flows.

AB There are numerous models of sedimentation in fine particle suspensions, derived from or validated with physical measurements. Such models could be applied to optimise and control gravity thickeners used for solid-liquid separation in mineral processing. However, these applications rely upon particle bridging by high molecular weight polymers to form large, low density and fragile aggregates. The evolution and refinement of sedimentation modelling for flocculated systems is restricted by a lack of meaningful control of flocculation conditions and inadequate detail in the experimental sedimentation data used for validation. To address this problem, an experimental system was built to give high fidelity sedimentation data, its use demonstrated for flocculated calcium carbonate suspensions. Turbulent pipe flow flocculation offers tight control of dosage, mean shear rate and reaction time, with aggregate size monitored in-line. The pipe discharges into the base of a wide (190 mm ID) transparent column for which the contents can be isolated, with mudlines then determined from image capture and bed profiles by gamma-attenuation. The use of wide columns minimised wall effects that can limit consolidation, while simultaneous efforts to maximise measurement reproducibility and sensitivity led to a greater ability to distinguish subtle impacts from variations in flocculation. Duplicate columns with detachable lower sections enable direct vane yield stress measurement at known bed depths and thereby plots of yield stress vs. solids fraction. Modelling of such data will be described in subsequent publications, with the present study focusing on key experimental requirements and limitations, the form of data outputs and insights into flocculation impacts. For the latter, off-line determination of individual aggregate settling rate vs. size after bed sampling confirmed that higher solids volume fractions low within beds occurred through removal of both inter- and intra-aggregate liquor, i.e. there is a contribution from aggregate densification. Bed profiles and yield stress responses also indicate flocculant functional chemistry can alter how aggregation limits the solids volume fractions attained.

AB We put forward a new expression of similarity between solute and solvent in terms of the cohesive energy for unlike molecules, which provides a quantitative measure of the principle that 'like dissolves like'. The investigation results indicate that as V-r (volume ratio) and SHSPR (the Square of Hansen Solubility Parameter Ratio) are far larger than unity (V-r >> 1, SHSPR >> 1), the similarity degree between solute and solvent is dominate by difference in molecular structure (size and interaction energy); as SHSPR approaches unity (SHSPR -> 1), the similarity degree is irrelative with molecular size, and it depends only on its deviation from ideal solution (positive or negative deviation). Its applications in water-solvent miscibility analysis, appropriate solvent selection for polymers and chemical products purification (liquid-liquid extraction and re-crystallization) have been verified with successful results.

AB Rigorous prediction of species concentration distribution has been challenging in the simulation of bubble column reactors. In the present manuscript, a theoretical model of turbulent mass transfer is introduced to the numerical simulation of the process of chemisorption of CO2 into NaOH aqueous solution in a bubble column reactor. In this model the turbulent mass diffusivity was expressed as a function of the concentration variance (c(2))over-bar and its dissipation rate epsilon(c), which were modeled to close the turbulent mass transfer differential equation system. As a result, along with the fluid velocity distribution, the species concentration distribution in the bubble column can be rigorously predicted simultaneously. By using the present model, the experience relying assumption of a constant turbulent Schmidt, which has been usually adopted in a traditional species concentration simulation, can be avoided. An RNG k-epsilon method combined with a population balance model for predicting the bubble size distribution was used to predict the gas-liquid velocity in the turbulent flow. The simulated pH values and carbonate concentration were shown to be in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data in literature. The simulations showed that the turbulent mass diffusivity varied along axial and radial directions in the bubble column and the calculated turbulent Schmidt number was not a constant. The proposed approach can be especially useful when empirical turbulent mass diffusivity is not available for simulating a similar process in a bubble column reactor. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study elucidates the sequential progression of agglomerate growth in fluidized beds through an investigation of physics and chemistry of particle-particle interaction. In fluidized bed gasification and combustion systems, agglomeration occurs by sticking of ash particles that are wetted by slag-liquid. Penn State has developed an agglomeration modeling methodology that considers non-uniform temperature, gaseous atmosphere and heterogeneity in ash chemical composition to predict slag-liquid formation and agglomerate growth rate. Simulations performed on three high rank coals with a consideration of these heterogeneous conditions, along with a microscopic (SEM) particle-level analysis of agglomerates facilitated an understanding of steps involved in their formation. The results of this study indicated that agglomerate growth in fluidized bed systems is initiated at the particle-level by low-melting components rich in iron- and calcium-based minerals. Agglomeration can begin at lower temperatures than the fluidized bed operating temperatures of 850 degrees C and the severity of agglomerate growth issues can be identified based on the slag-liquid level in the system. Understanding the stages involved in the process of agglomerate growth discussed in this paper can help develop early detection methods and mitigation strategies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) technologies involve the processing of synthesis gas (syngas) produced by carbonaceous fuels gasification. CO2 removal from syngas is a key requirement for combined CO2 capture and hydrogen production in IGCC power plant processes for both power generation and greenhouse-gas emission mitigation. Conventional absorption in packed columns using pressurized physical solvents such as Dimethyl Ether of Polyethylene Glycol (DEPG) (Selexo (TM)) is commonly used for this application. In this work, a dense skin hollow fiber membrane contactor (HFMC) based process for CO2 absorption and desorption using Selexol as a physical absorbent is investigated by simulation and compared to the conventional process. The ability of dense membranes to withstand high transmembrane pressure differentials allows the absorbent to circulate in a closed loop system at a fixed pressure set independently of the syngas pressure. Differing from the conventional process, neither absorbent depressurization before the desorber nor absorbent recompression before the absorber are needed. Under the investigated operating conditions wherein we used polydimetylsiloxane (PDMS), one of the most gas permeable polymeric membrane materials available, this process allowed for recovery of up to 94.6% of CO2, with CO2 and H-2 purity of 92.4% and 96.6% respectively. The corresponding energy requirement for the absorption and desorption loop was of 0.19 MJ(eI)/kg CO2 which is approximately two times lower than that reported in the literature under comparable gas inlet conditions and separation specifications using packed columns. Without flash recovery, the corresponding H-2 loss was of 4.8%. The overall mass transfer coefficient was of 1.2 . 10(5) m/s and 6.8 . 10(6) m/s in the absorber and desorber respectively. Membrane mass transfer lower or comparable to that of the absorbent combined with higher CO2/H-2 membrane selectivity is required for H-2 loss decrease. Lower H-2 loss is achieved at the expense of increased contactor size and liquid energy pumping energy. Finally, perspectives for process optimization are proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The copper-chlorine (Cu-Cl) cycle has significantly lower temperature requirements than most other cycles of thermochemical hydrogen production. The cycle involves multiple steps which include multiphase transport processes. Thermodynamic equilibrium of ternary mixtures in the Cu-Cl cycle have important effects on the transport processes. A ternary system consisting of cuprous chloride (CuCl), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and water exists in different variations of the Cu-Cl cycle. In this paper, new correlations are developed for the solubility of the ternary system, which are essential to providing accurate boundary conditions for the transport processes. This paper examines these multi-constituent transport processes and the corresponding constituent solubilities. A new semi-empirical formulation is presented for the solubility of the ternary system.

ID BATCH-DISTILLATION; OPTIMAL OPERATION; OPTIMIZATION
AB Solvent exchange or solvent swap is commonly used in production of complex organic molecules when the next processing step requires that the solute be dissolved in a different solvent. The current methods for solvent exchange, batch distillation and diafiltration, also produce a waste stream containing a mixture of the feed and chasing solvents that must be separated, usually by distillation. The results obtained from an Aspen Plus model of the new exchange column are compared with constant volume batch distillation simulations for both still pot and still pot plus column systems. The new solvent exchange column reduces the amount of the waste stream, and when the feed solvent is the more volatile solvent the exchange column can often be designed to produce feed solvent at the desired purity; thus, eliminating the need for an additional distillation column to separate the two solvents. When the initial solvent is the less volatile component, the new exchange column will often be competitive with constant volume diafiltration which is currently used. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, the method of Hansen solubility parameters was applied to identify a solvent substitution less toxic than dichloromethane used in a microencapsulation process. A theoretical approach was developed to investigate the influence of solvent type on water permeation across the solvent film in w/o/w template double emulsions. Analysis showed that water solubility in the solvent was a key factor in deciding water permeability across the solvent film, which could vary significantly with different solvents. Besides high water permeability, experiments showed that dichloromethane and ethyl acetate films in double emulsion also featured very low film robustness due to their high water permeability and poor film robustness. To improve film robustness, the influence of polymer and surfactant concentration in the film phase was studied. Results showed that increased viscosity and non-Newtonian conversion induced by polymers dissolved in the film phase could significantly improve the stability of the template double emulsion; the addition of hydrophobic surfactant Span 80 in the film phase significantly destabilized double emulsion with twofold effects: at low concentration water permeation was promoted while at high concentration deformation and breakup of the oil film were facilitated. Further study showed that different internal structures, i.e., microspheres of single- and multi-compartments, could be effectively tailored by employing the water permeation characteristics as predicted by the permeation model. The large cavity of the hollow single-compartment microspheres makes them particularly suitable as delivery vehicle systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To aid the understanding of multiphase flows and development of associated computational simulations, we reappraise the drift-flux model to improve accuracy and physical understanding. New insights are supported by careful re-derivation, literature review, and empirical verification. We directly calculate C-0 and C-1 using simultaneous measurements of instantaneous gas fraction and gas-liquid velocities, all obtained from a microscopic measurement volume (similar to 1 mm(3)) inside a macroscopic gas-liquid pipe flow (similar to 5000 cm(3) ) containing bubbles of similar to 250 mu m diameter. A reformulated drift-flux plot is created for this macroscopic flow by using gamma-beam densitometry and total flow measurements. The microscopic and macroscopic data both confirm that significant error exists in common methods and assumptions regarding the drift-flux model, namely in the common assumption that the drift-flux parameters C-0 and C-1 are invariant with respect to changes of flow. Our reformulated drift-flux model finds greatly different values of C-0 and C-1 from those predicted by standard drift flux methods, and finds values of C-0 and C-1 to undergo a regime transition due to changing bubble dynamics in the multiphase flow, wherein at low gas flow the bubbles seldom interact, as if they are at infinite dilution, while above a critical gas flow the hydrodynamics change due to bubbles interacting significantly with each other. These insights are uncovered only by reformulation of the practices of the drift-flux model. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we analyze theoretically the mass transport of a neutral solute in a pulsatile electroosmotic flow (PEOF), circulating in a parallel flat plate microchannel whose walls are characterized by asymmetric zeta potentials. The microchannel is connected to a two reservoirs having different concentrations. To analyze the mass transport in the PEOF, the Debye-Huckel approximation is assumed, and the electric potential in the Debye length is obtained from the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Then, using the momentum and concentration equations, the flow and concentration fields are analytically determined for the periodic stage. Such field distributions depend principally on three dimensionless parameters: an angular Reynolds number, the Schmidt number, and the ratio between the half height of the channel and the Debye length. For obtaining insight on the physical aspects of the studied phenomenon, an asymptotic solution is additionally obtained in the limits of small and large values of the angular Reynolds number. Some important results derived from this analysis show the conditions for which the mass transport of a neutral solute can be enhanced and the circumstances whereby mixing of species is achieved.

AB We investigate fluid-structure interaction using lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), where we introduce a new simple treatment for moving boundary. Sub-grids are defined to separate structures from main-grid, thus structures can be created and calculated independently. Mapping and interpolation are used to connect main-grid and sub-grids. Our proposed simulation approach demonstrates high reliability and stability when compared to the direct bounce back method available in the literature. We validate the proposed approach by simulations of a single vibration cylinder in still water and in flowing water. The results show good agreement with theory and reference experiments. We find a delay of fluid force in the simulation of compact cylinder array, and conclude that Mach number (Ma) and boundary force term have a great influence on the accuracy of calculation results. Ma should be carefully chosen for a reliable result. Compressible effect in LBM and its influence on calculation of fluid-structure interaction, which has not been studied in detail, are also discussed in this paper. It is hard to avoid time delay effect under the framework of LBM according to the analysis, and this may lead to inaccurate results in fluid-structure interaction calculation using LBM under certain conditions, which deserve more attention. This paper investigates the vibration of structure in fluid using LBM, which will support the research for fluid induced vibration. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, the method of volume averaging is applied for the mathematical modeling of transport and adsorption of benzene, toluene, and xylene in a packed bed of activated particles. One benefit of this approach is that it allows one to directly incorporate measured microscale information into macroscale models for predicting the effective transport and adsorption process. This work is novel in that it combines two levels of upscaling and a nonlinear adsorption process. The first level of upscaling develops an effective model for the mass transport and reaction in an activated carbon particle; within the particle, only diffusion and reaction are considered because of the very small pore sizes. The second level of upscaling develops the effective model for a collection of carbon particles forming the porous medium contained in a fixed-bed reactor; here, convection, diffusion, and dispersion are considered. The resulting model resembles a classical mobile-immobile representation of the transport and adsorption process. As part of the upscaling process, we develop the homogenized transport equations and their associated effective parameters using two different averaging volume support scales (i.e., at two disparate length scales). The effective parameters are all diffusion or dispersion tensors. These include (1) the effective diffusion tensor defining diffusion in the homogenized carbon particle, (2) the effective diffusion tensor for the immobile phase in the two-region representation of the medium, and (3) the effective hydrodynamic dispersion tensor (which included diffusion and dispersion) for the mobile region of the porous catalyst bed. Each of these effective parameters are determined by numerically solving closure problems over an idealized spatially periodic model of a porous medium. One novel feature of these particular closure problems is that they describe nonlinear adsorption at the microscale, which is a problem that is not currently represented in the literature. Once derived, the two-scale, two-equation mobile-immobile model was applied to predict experimentally-measured concentration breakthrough curves from packed bed columns with activated carbon from coconut shell as the adsorbent to the removal of petrochemical contaminants (BTX) by adsorption. There were no adjustable parameters in this modeling effort; the only modeling choice was whether the mass transfer coefficient should be computed from the correlations of Wakao and Funazkri (1978) for BTX components. The equations from closure problems and Darcy's scale of transport of this work were discretized using the finite volumes method and the solutions are found numerically through of a computational code and some packages from the free software OpenFOAM (R), version 2.2.x.

AB Rare earth oxalates precipitation is extendedly used in hydrometallurgical processes related to rare earth recycling methods and treatment of radioactive liquid wastes, where rare earth elements are separated from other fission products. For a deeper comprehension of this reactive precipitation process, the thermodynamic modeling of the oxalate-rare earth systems in nitric acid aqueous media is presented for neodymium and cerium systems, due to their distinctive relevance among the rare earth elements. A Pitzer model was selected for the modeling, which was developed using the implementation present within PHREEQC software. Calculations were launched through a COM interface with Matlab (R) and PHREEQC database was complemented by adjustment of the individual Pitzer coefficients for each species interaction to experimental data reported in literature and own experimental water activity measurements required to complete the study. The implemented model is able to accurately predict oxalate-rare earth solubility in a wide range of rare earth and nitric acid concentrations up to > 10 m. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB An anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) membrane bioreactor operated at 25 degrees C was used to investigate nitrogen removal under different operation conditions, namely, different sludge retention time (SRT) and nitrogen loading rate (NLR). The inhibition processes caused by high substance concentrations and over-loading were able to be circumvented by various adjustment methods. Furthermore, specific anammox activity (SAA) tests were performed to evaluate the effects of ammonium and nitrite on the anammox sludge. Over an SRT of 500 d, the content of volatile suspended solids (VSS) gradually increased from 125 mg/L to 5590 mg/L, and the maximum nitrogen removal rate (NRR) reached 1.18 kg N/m(3)/d. When the SRT was decreased to 50 d, the sludge concentration declined gradually, which necessitated an increase in the sludge loading rate (SLR), and the maximum sludge nitrogen removal rate (SNRR) of 0.67 g total nitrogen (TN)/g VSS/d was achieved at this time.

AB The gas temperature field measurement is crucial for the monitoring of the objects of interest. Owing to the distinct advantages, including non-invasive sensing, high safety, etc., the ultrasonic tomography (UT) method is considered to be a promising visualization measurement method, in which acquiring high-quality images is vital for real-world applications. In this paper, a new UT measurement system that integrates the Data Acquisition Card and a Single Chip Microcomputer is proposed for the temperature distribution measurement. A hardware system is designed to alleviate the inertia delay phenomenon. A reconstruction model that simultaneously emphasizes the inaccurate properties on the reconstruction model and the measurement data is proposed. By means of introducing the radial basis function method and the framework of the Tikhonov regularization technique, a two-stage reconstruction method is proposed to alleviate the ill-posed nature in the UT inverse problem. A new objective functional is proposed to convert the original reconstruction task into an optimization problem, and the simulated annealing algorithm is deployed to effectively solve the proposed objective functional. Experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed reconstruction method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The mathematical modeling of adsorption/retention behavior of surface active materials in a porous medium composed of a complex network of macropores, mesopores, and micropores was studied herein. In this paper, we propose a model for these processes and discuss selecting boundary conditions for parameter fitting, analyze tracer and surfactant signal sizes, contrast calculated results of reversible and irreversible adsorption, and address the difference between local equilibrium and the rate-limited process. We used experimental data from the literature to adjust the parameters of the proposed model, taking macroporosity and mesoporosity into account. Our results show that at least two types of porosity should be used for modeling porous media. Moreover, the boundary condition at the outlet was found to significantly affect the output response. This effect is greater in systems with low Peclet numbers (high dispersion and/or diffusion, i.e., N-Pe < 5). Therefore, an appropriate boundary condition should be used if an analytical solution is employed to fit experimental parameters for the tracer. In addition, we observed that two input signal characteristics, namely slug size and rectangular pulse, proved to be of great importance in determining the output response when they are smaller than the corresponding values that would cause the system to reach adsorption saturation. A local equilibrium assumption is only valid when the flow conditions result in a Stanton number greater than 10. Our model should be helpful in guiding the design of dynamic adsorption experiments and understanding the ways in which hetero-geneities in the rock influence the interpretation of experimental results.

AB A thorough understanding of the collision motions and involved hydrodynamic behaviors of double emulsion droplets under the influence of an external flow is important for the design and fabrication of a core-shell structured chemical product via droplet-based fluidic processing. In this study, experimental observations are combined with numerical simulation to analyze the hydrodynamic binary collision between double emulsion droplets under shear. The passing-over motion of the colliding droplets is observed and quantitatively characterized by providing the motion trajectories and temporal droplet deformation. In particular, because of an additional interaction induced by the inner droplet, we demonstrate that the double emulsion droplets exhibit similar motion trajectories but different deformation development versus ordinary single-phase ones throughout the collision process. Additionally, the increase in confinement (i.e. the decrease in spacing gap between two parallel moving walls in the typical Couette shear geometry) is found to induce a higher shear rate and larger elongational components at the tips of the deformed double emulsion droplets, which produce further stretched colliding droplets.

AB Highly photoactive nanocomposites Sep-TiO2 with various ratios of Ti/Sep were prepared by a novel microwave-hydrothermal method and were compared for their photocatalytic activity. The catalyst with the Ti/Sep ratio of 40 mmol/g showed the highest photodegradation activity on account of its relatively intact sepiolite structure and more anatase active sites. The effects of operational conditions, including photocatalyst amount, initial dye concentration and pH on photocatalytic degradation performance were analyzed and optimized, which demonstrated low and negligible photodegradation efficiency in the presence of sepiolite only and in the absence of photocatalyst, respectively. The photocatalytic degradation kinetics under different reaction conditions was elucidated by modeling. The results showed that the photocatalytic degradation of Orange G could be described by the modified Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. The photocatalytic degradation process fits into first-order kinetics for most of the operational parameters, while follows zero-order kinetics for the condition of high dye concentration. The apparent rate constants kapp for each degradation reaction were calculated by fitting the model to experimental data and the highest value was obtained at catalyst dosage 0.8 g/L, initial dye concentration 10 mg/L and pH = 3. Moreover, the recycling experiments confirmed the stability of the catalyst. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Role of water as the co-solvent in eco-friendly processing oil

AB Furfural solvent extraction is a conventional process that removes toxic polycyclic aromatics (PCAs) from eco-friendly processing oil. To increase the product yield and extraction selectivity, the present study introduces water as the co-solvent and investigates its effect using both experimental and theoretical approaches. The effects of the water content in furfural on the product yield, PCA content, aromatic carbon fraction and hydrocarbon type distribution are systematically investigated and optimized. At the appropriate furfural/water ratio in two-stage extraction, the product yield increases by 9 wt% while maintaining the product quality at an acceptable level. An a priori COnductor-like Screening Model for Segment Activity Coefficient (COSMO-SAC) model is used to predict the product composition after extraction. The prediction is consistent with the experimental data. This model can identify the optimal water content using only one experimental result. The result shows that controlling the water content in furfural is critically important during the furfural-extract oil (FEO) furfural extraction process. Both the experimental data and the simulation method in this paper are expected to help control and optimize the extraction process, as well as provide a better understanding of the process.

AB The PC-SAFT Equation of State is applied here to study polymer - blowing agent phase equilibrium in various systems of industrial interest. Where required, PC-SAFT parameters of blowing agents and polymers are obtained by regression to experimental data. Gas solubility and swelling ratio of polymer material predicted by PC-SAFT is seen to agree well with experiments. The PC-SAFT model is then extended to predict gas solubility and swelling ratio in a broad range of operating conditions, well beyond those reported by corresponding experiments. PC-SAFT has also been robust in predicting gas solubility in random copolymer or gas blend foaming systems showing additional degrees of freedom in foam formulation design, and requiring only inputs from the individual homopolymer or single blowing agent systems. From this work, PC-SAFT offers a reliable method to extrapolate existing measured data and provide guidelines for screening and design of new products and processes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB External gelation process of Ca-alginate gel with a controlled supply of CaCl2 to alginate solution was experimentally and numerically investigated. A single Na-alginate solution film was prepared and suspended in a closed chamber of CaCl2 spray droplets. The collected mass of CaCl2 by the film increases as the spraying time increases. The collection efficiency (E) between the film and CaCl2 droplets was averagely 0.0015. The degree of gelation (P) of the film was found to be alginate and CaCl2 solution concentration dependent. The experimental results of the mass of CaCl2 droplets collected by the film and the E were in good agreement with the numerical results. The concentration-distance profiles of Ca2+ cation, alginate, and Ca-alginate gel in the film were determined using the one-dimensional diffusion-reaction model. The model is useful to determine the P of the Ca-alginate gel film produced using a limited supply of CaCl2. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A commercial-scale generation of uniform and well-controlled soft microparticles is critical for therapeutic embolization, a minimally invasive, nonsurgical interventional therapeutic technique for the treatment of various conditions, including tumors, vascular lesions and hemorrhages. We report the generation of required embolic microparticles from an electrified meniscus of the precursor alginate solution. A micro-dripping regime is identified with electric Bond number BE being from 0.3 to 1 and Weber number We < 1, where the conical tip of the charged meniscus emits a single yet fine droplet periodically. The droplet diameter d(d) and its generation frequency f scale with the dimensionless controlling parameters in the form of d(d) similar to q(0.5), f similar to q(-0.15)B(E)(0.67) in this regime, with q being the dimensionless flow rate. Our results are valuable for effective production of therapeutic microparticles on a commercial scale from precursor solution of similar physical properties. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A High Pressure Differential Scanning Calorimeter (HP-mu DSC) was used to characterize the kinetic inhibition performance of several kinetic hydrate inhibitors (KHIs) up to 390 bar (39 MPa) of model natural gas. A novel protocol was devised to increase the spread between effective KHIs to obtain their performance ranking. The natural gas used in the study was a mixture of 90 mol% methane and 10 mol% propane. Linear cooling ramps at a constant cooling rate of 0.5 K/min were used under isobaric conditions. Both the formation temperature of natural gas hydrate during a linear cooling ramp and the amount of hydrate formed were used for comprehensive analysis. The second method was based on the growth inhibition of natural gas hydrates and opened a new possibility that only several repeat measurements may be sufficient for fast screening of good KHIs. The results showed that HP-mu DSC is a promising tool for the evaluation of kinetic inhibition performance of KHIs that can only be obtained in minute quantities. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ambient air vaporizers (AAVs) are used to re-gasify cryogenic industrial gases for distribution and use. Although AAVs have low carbon footprint, fog formation around the ambient air vaporizers is a common problem, thus often leading to reduced visibility. Moreover, since AAVs exchange the heat from the surrounding air, the efficiency of the process is also at stake due to possible recycling of exiting air. Thus, simulating fog formation, dispersion and dissipation around AAVs is of critical importance. So far most of the studies for AAV consider fog in single phase framework, which are incapable of simulating the dispersion and dissipation of fog accurately. In this study, multiphase model of fog formation and dissipation has been developed considering the thermodynamics and heat transfer effects. The models have been validated using available wind tunnel data for a velocity and temperature field around a sample obstacle. A parametric study has been also presented to demonstrate the effect of wind velocity, AAV inlet air velocity and number of AAV units on the ambient conditions. The study provides an in-depth insight of the process and presents an analysis of operating conditions suitable for AAVs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study aims to assess capability of mostly used hybrid URANS/LES methods in dealing with a complex swirled configuration/reactor when the residence time characteristics need to be predicted at acceptable level of accuracy and fidelity. The configuration is quite complex and out of reach of the classical RANS turbulence models as it consists of different, partly swirled inlet channels and a large variety of time and length scales. In this work only the flow field is considered and is investigated using three different hybrid URANS/LES simulation methods. The models: the Scale Adaptive Simulation (SAS), the Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation(SA-IDDES) and the k - omega - DES, use different triggering mechanisms and underlying RANS models. The results of the flow field, the residence time characteristics and all related quantities are compared with both the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and experimental data reported in Doost et al. (2016). It turns out that none of the considered hybrid methods is able to predict the residence time characteristics as well as LES does mainly due to the inaccurate prediction of the flow field. It was found that there is a need to improve the hybrid approaches by addressing the shortcomings, particularly those regarding triggering mechanism to make hybrid approaches a reliable computational tool for study complex turbulent flows inside full scale configurations where LES can be prohibitively expensive.

AB A multiscale analysis on the erosion of the immersed tubes in a 3-D fluidized bed is conducted using computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM) coupling a particle-scale erosion model referred to as the shear impact energy model (SIEM). Different gas velocities and tube shapes are adopted to obtain more information. Several hydrodynamic parameters, including the void and solid fraction, the average particle speed, the granular temperature and the fluctuation energy (defined as the sum of the granular temperature) have been obtained and analyzed. Since the hydrodynamic properties have great effect on erosion of the immersed tube, a quantitative analysis was carried out based on the hydrodynamic parameters around the tubes. An intrinsic relation between erosion on the immersed tube and the fluctuation energy has been revealed based on the analysis, which indicates that the fluctuation energy of the particles near the tube probably is the main reason for the erosion. Moreover, the ordered motion of the particles also has some effect on the erosion, especially on the erosion of the top and bottom of the tube when the gas velocity is high. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We propose a non-intrusive optical method to reconstruct the boundary between the two immiscible liquids under the well separated interfacial configurations. Silicon based PIN (a diode with p-type semiconductor, a lightly doped intrinsic region and an n-type region) photodiodes are used in reverse biased photovoltaic mode and extent of attenuation in the intensity of light is employed to relate the phase fraction (h/b) with obtained current signals. Phase fraction is found to have exponential relationship with the non-dimensional optical signals and is used to reconstruct the interface profile for different phase associations. The optically acquired interface profiles are in close agreement with the visual inspections for both the inclined and curved phase boundaries. Moreover, the present system is found to capable of characterizing the transient variations of the interface. This has been examined by successful prediction of interface oscillations and transient, random wavy profiles. It has also been established that preset photodiode array could be employed for measurement of flow rates and local phase fractions under the stratified regime. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

   media

ID FLOW; DISPERSION; ADSORPTION; DIFFUSION
AB Oscillations in flow occur under many different situations in natural porous media, due to tidal, daily or seasonal patterns. In this paper, we investigate how such oscillations in flow affect the transport of an initially sharp solute front, if the solute undergoes nonlinear sorption and, disregarding molecular diffusion, mechanical dispersion. By homogenization, we show that after many cycles, the transport converges to a zero convection, pure nonlinear diffusion problem. The impact of the oscillatory flow requires an adjustment of the dispersion coefficient, where instead of the modulus of the particle velocity, we have to use its time averaged value. Physically, this agrees with a velocity defined by the distance travelled by particles in solution, divided by the time needed for that displacement. The nonlinearity of the sorption reaction is retained in the concentration distribution of the mixing zone, because in the large time limit, this distribution is not Gaussian but asymmetric. With numerical simulations, we show that this convergence may occur relatively fast (say 10 cycles). The implication of the diffusion like large time behaviour is that the transition zone continues to spread beyond the zone of convective oscillation. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the liquid/ liquid reaction of isobutane alkylation with C4 olefins, the solubility and diffusion properties of isobutane in catalyst phase exert substantial effect on the quality of alkylate. The solubility, diffusion, and permeability of isobutane and 2-butene in the 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium ionic liquids (ILs) with various anions including [BMIm][PF6], [BMIm][BF4], [BMIm][Tf2N] and [BMIm][Al2Cl7], and other ILs with different alkyl chains length including [BMIm][AlCl4], [HMIm][AlCl4] and [OMIm][AlCl4], as well as the H2SO4, were investigated using molecular dynamic simulation. Compared to H2SO4, the ILs were more favorable for the dissolution and diffusion of isobutane. The predicted isobutane solubility in ILs follows the order of [BMIm][Al2Cl7] > [BMIm][AlCl4] > [BMIm][Tf2N] > [BMIm][PF6] > [BMIm][BF4] for ILs with different anions, and [OMIm][AlCl4] > [HMIm][AlCl4] > [BMIm][AlCl4] for ILs with different alkyl chain length. The higher solubility of isobutane can be ascribed to the weaker cation-anion interaction, lower solubility parameter, and larger free volume. The isobutane diffusion follows the same trend as solubility for ILs with different anions, but opposite trend for ILs with various alkyl chain length. 2-butene shares the similar trend as isobutane, but shows a higher solubility and diffusion. In addition, isobutane and 2-butene permeability in ILs was estimated based on the solvation-diffusion mechanism. This work may help us better understand the structure-property of ILs for isobutane solubility and diffusion, and further provides new insights into the screening and design of novel ILs for the isobutane alkylation.

AB The work deals with the problem of fabricating new materials for modern devices of microelectromechanics, microelectronics, biomimetics, etc. using the local electrodeposition of metals. The mathematical model is developed for the formation of 3D microstructures (microcolumns) by the local electrochemical deposition of metal using a moving disk microanode. The numerical solution of the mathematical problem is performed using the finite element method on the irregular grid. The grid is deformed and adaptively remeshed during modeling of deposit growth. Evolution of deposit surface is calculated for various exchange current densities, transfer coefficients, interelectrode distances and various dependences of the current efficiency on the current density.
   The results of modeling allow one to determine the relationships between the parameters of electrodeposition and the shape and dimensions of formed microstructures. These data can be used to predict the results of local electrodeposition of metal and to optimize the operation conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays, membrane processes are together with cryogeny, absorption and adsorption considered to be a key technology for gas separation applications. Process selectivity is of primary importance in order to respect the specifications but can in some cases be limited due to a too low membrane selectivity. Parallel to improvements in the membrane selectivity of certain materials, unsteady membrane operations can also be attempted in order to achieve a higher separation selectivity, but this strategy remains largely unexplored. A novel, simple, unsteady-state process, complementary to the strategies already proposed by the previous authors, is reported in this study. A systematic comparison of steady state, short-class (i.e. with time lag) and long-class (i.e. pseudo steady-state) processes is described for O-2/N-2 (PPO membrane), He/Kr (PEMA membrane) and H-2/CO2 (polyimide and a reverse selective PEBAX membrane) separations. Based on a selectivity composition path chart, the maximal purity or process selectivity achievable by steady and unsteady processes was compared. The new long-class process was shown to offer similar or increased selectivity compared to steady-state operation, at the expense of a lower productivity. Finally, the applicability to industrial separations and the remaining challenges are also discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, the use of nanoparticles in extraction columns has gained increasing attention due to their potential to enhance mass transfer processes. Most of the reported work, however, has been concerned with mass transfer enhancement in gas-liquid systems in the presence of nanoparticles, while limited studies of liquid-liquid systems have been reported. Liquid-liquid extraction is an extensively employed separation method that has taken on a substantial role in engineering and industrial applications for recovery processes. Therefore, the aim of this review article is to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art from the available literature on the effect of nanoparticles on the hydrodynamic behavior and mass transfer performance of liquid-liquid systems. Attention is also given to providing an understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the improvements in mass transfer with the use of nanoparticles. In the majority of studies, the presence of nanoparticles was found to be beneficial and to lead to improvedmass transfer, although a few investigations reported a detrimental impact of nanoparticles. The literature does not clearly describe the conditions under which the addition of nanoparticles would be unfavorable. Moreover, the addition of nanoparticles always introduces potential drawbacks, such as sedimentation, accumulation, or clogging inside extraction columns, as well as the need to separate the nanoparticles at the outlets. These drawbacks have not been considered in the literature, limiting the practical employment of nanoparticles in this industry. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Study of water wetting and water layer thickness in oil-water flow in
   horizontal pipes with different wettability

AB Two-phase oil-water pipe flow is common in oil production and transportation. Appropriate estimation of phase wetting (oil wet or water wet) of internal pipe walls can significantly reduce corrosion control costs, and increase confidence in measures taken to ensure the integrity of pipelines. Water wetting can be avoided by fully dispersing the water phase into the oil phase. It has been suggested that pipe wettability may affect oil-water flow patterns; particularly, water-in-oil dispersed flow transition boundaries. However, there are no systematic studies in the literature on this matter for carbon steel pipes, which are the preferable choice for economic reasons in the oil and gas industry. Moreover, traditional and widely used models to predict the onset of dispersed flow do not consider the effect of pipe wettability. This work studies phase wetting and water layer thickness in large scale oil-dominated oil-water horizontal flow in carbon steel and PVC pipes of similar internal diameter (0.1 m) and roughness, but different wettability. The effect of wetting hysteresis (oil or water pre-wetted pipe surface) on phase wetting is also investigated. It is demonstrated that pipe wettability plays a very important role on the transition boundaries for phase wetting (oil wet to water wet) and the transition to fully dispersed flow. Water droplet deposition and spreading are identified as the main mechanisms for incipient segregation in a hydrophilic pipe. In a hydrophobic pipe, poor surface wettability hinders the sticking and spreading of water droplets. Water wetting in a hydrophobic pipe requires a sufficient low flow velocity at which local droplet accumulation and coalescence becomes the dominant segregation mechanism. Predictions from available hydrodynamic models are compared with the experimental results and recommendations are provided. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The kinetics of the heterogeneous oxidation of zinc vapor by water vapor were measured in a tube flow reactor for temperatures from 800 to 1100 K, zinc vapor partial pressures up to 0.39 atm, and water vapor partial pressures up to 1.0 atm. The results extend the prior data for oxidation of zinc by water vapor from zinc partial pressures on the order of 0.01 atm to higher values appropriate for fuel production via the Zn/ZnO thermochemical cycle. Measured oxidation rates span 10(-7)-10(-5) mol cm(-2) s(-1). A second order, reversible reaction rate expression r '' - k(Zn-H2O) (p(Zn(g))P(H2O) -p(H2)/K-eq) is developed from regression of the data and a numerical model of advective and diffusive mass transfer. The kinetic parameter k(Zn-H2O) is a non-monotonic function of temperature with a negative activation energy for temperatures between 800 and 1050 K, consistent with prior studies. In a second set of experiments, the rate of the heterogeneous oxidation of zinc vapor by mixtures of water vapor and carbon dioxide was measured. The product gas is hydrogen rich due to faster surface reaction kinetics for oxidation with water vapor than with carbon dioxide. We conclude that it is preferable to split water and carbon dioxide in separate reactors rather than co-produce H-2 and CO in a single reactor for production of synthesis gas in the Zn/ZnO solar thermochemical redox cycle.

AB This paper aims at proposing a graphical representation composed of several performance maps to help to answer to some current questions that can puzzle membrane end-users facing the arrangement of membranes in cascade in order to better master separation of complex media. Indeed, different compromises can be highlighted according to realistic goals for the separation such as quality and recovery yield of each fraction/component, energy consumption and required membrane area. This representation needed first the systematic simulations of cascades of pre-selected configurations. These last ones were chosen thanks to the target application field, namely the organic solvent nanofiltration of a final synthesis media of hydroformylation that is a homogeneous catalysed reaction. We voluntary assumed the a priori limitation of the number of stages to 5, anticipating that more complex cascades will probably be too expensive (both operating and capital costs). The graphical representation by itself is based on sets of six 2D-maps. Each map highlights relationships selected in an appropriate way between two of the six selected criteria: extraction/recovery, retentate/permeate quality/purity, membrane filtering area and overall energy consumption. For sake of illustration, the separation of 2 components C and A was considered. C/A has been chosen in a 1/1000 molar ratio, where C corresponds to the less retained component of the catalytic system that must be recovered in the retentate and A corresponds to the less transmitted product to extract in the permeate. In realistic nanofiltration conditions achieved in toluene, the rejections were experimentally determined on the initial media to filter. C has a high rejection (88%) whereas A has a low one (30%). The simulations of cascades were established using these constant values for rejection and the experimental permeate flux. For sake of an illustration of the use of the graphical representation, a case study was finally discussed regarding a given target of recovery for the two desired components, namely at least 99% of C recovery and better than 70% of A extraction. A complementary multi-criteria analysis was added aiming at facilitating the decision-making. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we apply a novel immersed boundary method to simulate pore-scale level fluid flow and convective heat transfer in realistic numerically generated open-cell solid foams in a Cartesian computational domain. Five different periodic foam samples of varying porosities (epsilon = [0.877, 0.948]) are generated by numerically mimicking the actual foam formation process (minimizing surface area). The step-by-step procedure for generating the periodic foam geometries is presented. The specific surface areas of the generated foams of different porosities are compared with real foam geometries showing a reasonable agreement. The Reynolds number (Re) is varied from Re approximate to 0 (creeping flow) to Re approximate to 500, and finally drag and Nusselt correlations have been proposed. A detailed analysis is presented on the local velocity and temperature field for the fluid-solid interaction in a complex cellular porous medium. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The process for dehydration of 3-hydroxypropionic acid to produce acrylic acid was investigated over solid acid catalysts containing HY, ZSM-5, Beta, MCM-41 and silica gel. These catalysts were comprehensively characterized by techniques including XRD, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, NH3-TPD, Pyridine-IR, TGA and C-13 CP MAS-NMR. Silica gel was found to show the highest acrylic acid selectivity of > 99.0% at a complete 3-hydroxypropionic acid conversion. Results from NH3-TPD and Pyridine-IR analyses reveal that the acidity has a significant effect on catalytic performance. The selective conversion of 3-hydroxypropionic acid to acrylic acid over silica gel can be ascribed to the weak and small amount of Lewis acid sites as well as the absence of Bronsted acid sites. Increasing Bronsted acid sites for HY, ZSM-5, Beta and MCM-41 resulted in low acrylic acid selectivities due to increasing of acetic acid formation. TG and C-13 CP MAS-NMR results further indicate that the presence of Bronsted acid sites favors the formation of coke. And the coke deposited on these catalysts has a primarily aromatic nature. Stability test indicates the silica gel catalyst exhibits an excellent stability for 200 h. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An innovative permselectivity test bench is used in order to determine the axial distribution of two properties of a stainless steel porous tube, which are the permeance and the gas selectivity. The effects of the operating conditions (inlet mass flowrate and inlet pressure) have been studied. A new radial form of the gas permeability equation has been developed for this work and its relationship with Darcy's permeability is established for a cylindrical configuration of the test. The pressure variation along the centre axis of the tube is determined. The effects of this pressure variation on the physical properties of gases such as density and viscosity are determined and their influence on the selectivity of gases is studied. It is found that the gas density and gas viscosity decrease along the flow. This decrease leads to an increase in the gas permeability for N-2 and a decrease for CO2. Consequently, the selectivity (N-2/CO2) increases. The obtained results can be useful to understand the factors affecting gas separation in case of a porous tube for continuous industrial processes.

AB Model-based optimization under consideration of uncertainty is an important and active research topic. In order to handle uncertain model and process parameters for the design and optimization of chemical processes, various different approaches have been proposed in the literature. Among these approaches, the application of unscented transformation (UT) methods received increasing attention recently. The UT is used to calculate approximations of the first two statistical moments of the objective and constraints which are implemented in the optimization problem. Since the UT only allows for approximations of the statistical moments, the approximation error inevitably influences the optimization. In the present contribution, we emphasize that a poor approximation significantly reduces the meaningfulness of an optimization under uncertainty approach. Hence, we compare a variety of UT methods and study the effect of their corresponding tuning parameters on the approximation accuracy. Furthermore, we investigate four different cubature rules which are well known from the numerical integration literature and which show similarities to the UT from an implementational point of view.
   The individual methods are compared in terms of approximation accuracy and computational effort based on examples from chemical reaction engineering. Our results indicate that the cubature rule labeled as CU51 provides the most accurate results at reasonable computational costs. The recently proposed cubature rule labeled as MSSRC provides less accurate results, but is computationally more efficient than the CU51 rule and is thus an attractive alternative. Regarding the UT methods, the results show that the proper choice of the tuning parameter significantly influences the optimization results. Furthermore, it is shown that the common tuning parameter selection rule for the original UT does not necessarily yield the most accurate approximation. Hence, based on our results we suggest to favor the application of cubature rules for optimization under uncertainty over the unscented transformation methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Post-combustion CO2 capture using amine scrubbing is the most promising technology to reduce CO2 emissions from coal-or gas-fired power plants. Increasing CO2 absorption rate (k(g)') reduces the absorber capital cost, which is the cost center of the capture plant. By partially replacing water with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) in 7 m (30 wt%) aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA), the CO2 absorption rate (k(g)') is significantly enhanced because of lower CO2 loading/higher free MEA at the same CO2 partial pressure (P-*CO2), greater CO2 physical solubility, and greater MEA activity. At 40 degrees C, in the operating range of 100-5000 Pa P-*CO2, the average k(g)' of 7 m MEA in 3 water/1 NMP, 1 water/3 NMP, and 1 water/19 NMP is 1.1 times, 2 times, and 5 times that of 7 m aqueous MEA, respectively. CO2 physical solubility, solvent viscosity, and MEA activity were measured. A kinetic model was built in MATLAB (R) to better understand the mass transfer of CO2 into semi-aqueous MEA (MEA-NMP-water). The model suggests that the diffusion and reaction of CO2 into aqueous MEA can be approximated by pseudo-first-order (PFO) behavior and adding NMP causes deviation from PFO by the depletion of MEA at the surface. The semi-aqueous solvent provides an excellent rate of CO2 absorption, but the increased viscosity reduces normalized capacity and the volatility of the physical solvent must be addressed.

AB Residence time distribution (RTD) curves for coiled flow inverters (CFIs), helically coiled tubes (HCT), and straight tubes (ST) with single phase and segmented liquid-liquid flows were studied with pulse injection employing laser optical and conductivity detection. Reactor design and volume rates were chosen to cover conditions relevant for practical laboratory investigations, such as channel diameters between 0.8 mm and 3.2 mm, volume rates between 1 and 360 ml/min, 14 <= Re <= 2414, 4 <= De <= 451 and a number of up to 60 flow inversions for CFIs. RTD curves were examined in terms of moment analysis and time-domain least squares fitting. For single phase flows deviations from the axial dispersion model (ADM) were observed for ST and HCT and rationalized in terms of Fo number. For the CFIs consistency of the RTD curves with the ADM was observed over the entire range of experimental parameters due to strong chaotic mixing. For segmented liquid-liquid flow simultaneous measurements of RTD curves and slug lengths were performed. The length of the slugs decreased with increasing flow rate. The RTD curves showed good consistency with ADM throughout the experiments for all reactors investigated. Observed Bo numbers decreased at relatively low flow rates in the order CFI > HCT > ST while at relatively high flow rates Bo for HCT and CFI became similar but still higher than ST. Ca numbers indicated that mixing between the vortex and film regions probably dominated the dispersion at low flow rates, while at high flow rates dispersion was likely to be dominated by the film thickness.

AB To rapidly separate and isolate specific-sized particles by inertial focusing from biological samples, microfluidic networks with curved branches have become subject of prototyping. However, determining the optimal channel dimensions for size-based separation is challenging due to the sophisticated fluid-particle interactions and high sensitivity of the inertial forces to the channel geometry. In the first part of the study, hydrodynamic forces acting upon the particle in the existence of the Dean vortices are modeled and simulated. Simulations are validated with available experimental data. Then, a series of computational experiments is run for various curvatures and cross-section sizes, and translocation of particles through curved branches is projected. Width of the focusing band is predicted for different-sized particles. Occurrences of a narrow (high-quality) focusing, dispersion of the particles (no focusing) and split of the focusing band are also determined. Nevertheless, a considerable pressure drop is expected due to the narrow and high curvature daughters of the considered network. A design rule is not available to resolve this problem and the Murray's law is not valid for curved daughters. Therefore, in the second part of the study, an optimum design formulation for restraining the hydraulic resistance inside such networks is developed and tested. The proposed formulation can be practiced to predict the optimum length, curvature and aspect ratio of the daughter branches for such inertial separation networks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The fluidized bed signals can be decomposed into micro-scale, meso-scale and macro-scale by means of multi-resolution analysis, while how to perform the scale resolution accurately and convincingly still lacks appropriate criteria. In this study, the dual-channel fiber optical signals in the circulating fluidized bed were utilized to investigate the characteristic differences of correlation coefficients and time-delay between three scales. It's found that for two adjacent measurement signals there's good correlation and obvious time-delay at the meso-scale, characterizing the dynamic evolution of cluster structure, while high correlation and no time-delay at the macro-scale (apparatus scale), and no correlation at the micro-scale (discrete particles). Based on such analysis, the correlation time-delay function (CTF) f(tau r) was put forward as a scale resolution criterion to examine the characteristics of both correlation and time-delay between a pair of signals. Through analyzing the changes of f(tau r) with the level of decomposition signals, the raw fiber optical signals obtained from a pilot scale circulating fluidized bed (CFB) riser were effectively resolved into three scales.

AB We propose a strategy for rapid in situ fabrication of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) hybrid membrane with assistance of the two dimensional (2D) graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets at room temperature. The negatively charged g-C3N4 nanosheets with abundant nitrogen coordinating sites are capable to capture and anchor Zn2+ and thus provide a large number of heterogeneous nucleation sites for the formation of initial ZIF-8 crystals. During the cyclical spin coating of the Zn2+/g-C3N4 nanosheets and the ligand (2-methylimidazole), the in situ formed ZIF-8 crystal nucleus on g-C3N4 nanosheets promote the further growth of continues defect-free membranes. The ZIF-8/g-C3N4 membrane with thickness of similar to 240 nm can be obtained using this strategy within 30 min at room temperature, which is attractive for fast and facile preparation of molecular sieving membranes. Moreover, it exhibits promising H-2/CO2 separation performance with the selectivity up to 42, which is superior to many other ZIF-8 membranes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB By dispersing zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) in different liquids composed of water, glycol, and 2-methylimidazole (mIm), a series of ZIF-8/water-glycol-mIm slurries were formed. The sorption isotherms of CO2 in these slurries, as well as in aqueous solution of mIm, were measured in the temperature range from 293.15 to 313.15 K. Next, the enthalpies of CO2 sorption in these slurries were correspondingly determined using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. At the same time, the sorption kinetics and regeneration performances of the slurries were investigated. The results show that CO2 absorption in aqueous mIm solutions is dominated by chemical absorption, while in the ZIF-8/mIm-water-glycol slurry, CO2 uptake is determined by both chemical absorption and physical adsorption. Increasing ZIF-8 content in slurry can significantly increase the sorption capacity and decrease the sorption heat by increasing the physical adsorption contribution. Increasing ZIF-8 content can even increase the sorption rate within a certain content range. Although the presence of glycol decreases the sorption capacity and increases viscosity to a certain extent, it also significantly decreases the desorption heat. By considering sorption capacity, desorption heat, and viscosity, a particular ZIF-8 slurry recipe, i.e., solid fraction of 15-25.0 wt% and liquid composition of approximately mIm 25 wt% + water 40 wt% + glycol 35 wt%, is recommended, for which the CO2 sorption capacity can reach 1.6 mol/L (higher than that of some alkanol amine solutions) under ambient pressure and 313.15 K, while the desorption heat could be as low as 32 kJ/mol. The structure of ZIF-8 can remain intact in the CO2 capture process in the presence of mIm, i.e., the slurry could be regenerated perfectly. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An improved liquid distribution model based on a volume cell (LDMvc) was proposed to predict the liquid load distribution in a packed column under offshore conditions. The LDMvc contained four tuning parameters. The LDMvc is an improvement of the existing intersection-based LDM since the number of model tuning parameters is reduced to four through a sophisticated flow split algorithm, and a gas flow distribution model can be associated with the LDMvc. Two experimental columns with inner diameters of 0.133 m and 0.4 m were packed with Mellapak 500X-like elements for a 1.4 m bed height and Mellapak 250X-like elements for a 4 m bed height, respectively. The 4 m bed height column was built on a sloshing machine to simulate ship movement. The liquid distribution inside the columns was measured using an electrical resistance tomography (ERT) system. The offshore conditions were a permanent tilt ranging from 2 to 6 degrees and a roll motion with three amplitude-period pairs. The LDMvc, after tuning with the experimental data, reliably predicted the liquid load distribution in the packed columns under different tilts and roll motions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The present work focuses on the hydrodynamics variation and mass transfer characteristics of Taylor flow along long serpentine microchannels with a square cross-section. The volumetric mass transfer coefficient (k(L)a) is regarded as the transient change value to characterize the gas-liquid mass transfer process of CO2 in water. All experimental data of Taylor bubble are obtained from 1000 continuously captured images. An online high-speed imaging method and the unit cell model are adopted in this study. The effects of gas and liquid flow rates, together with microchannel geometry are investigated on Taylor bubble characteristics in terms of length, velocity and the mass transfer performance.
   Taylor bubble length shrinks and subsequently plateaus out along the flow direction from the T-junction, resulting in the decrease in Taylor bubble velocity. k(L)a in a unit cell gradually decreases along the serpentine microchannel, and increases as the channel cross-sectional area decreases. As the gas flow rate increases under a given liquid flow rate, a critical point is found for the evolution of k(L)a and k(L) (that is the liquid phase mass transfer coefficient). The results indicate that the contribution of the circulation in the liquid slug to kL is dominant before the critical point compared to the leakage flow in the liquid film. All these findings in this work give important information to understand the dynamic change in gas-liquid Taylor flow mass transfer within microchannels. They will serve as basis for designing and optimizing gas-liquid multiphase microreactors in the future. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The modeling of wet granular materials is an important research topic in chemical engineering. This study focuses on the numerical model for the capillary liquid bridge force in sphere-sphere and sphere-plane configurations, which is an indispensable ingredient of wet particle simulations. The first part of this study describes a direct approach via optimization of the interfacial energy of the liquid bridge system. The results, referred to as the optimal solutions, can be used as reference values for the exact solutions of static liquid bridges. In the second part, a force model is presented based on a toroidal approximation of the liquid bridge profile. Particularly, its advantage resides in the generality, which is applicable to a wide range of liquid volumes, contact angles and radius ratios. Predictions by the proposed model are validated against experimental data and optimal solution, from which good agreements are obtained. Numerical tests indicate that the relative error by the proposed model is generally below 10% within a wide range of contact angles and liquid volumes, showing its satisfactory accuracy for calculating the capillary force. It is expected that the present model will be useful for practical numerical analysis of wet granular materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Heat or mass transfer becomes usually complicated if coupled with fluid flow. To model the process, the mass, heat, and momentum conservation equations have been well established, which are shown in our work not the only governing laws. We analyzed heat transfer entropy generation rate and viscous dissipation of coupled heat and momentum transport phenomena in Rayleigh-Benard convection, and proposed a hypothesis that the velocity and temperature distributions can be governed by the balance between the maximization of entropy generation and the minimization of viscous dissipation. Such a criterion, combined with a multi-scale model, was used to formulate a variational problem, which was then solved to reconstruct the velocity, temperature, and Nusselt number distributions in the Rayleigh-Benard convection. As a result, three parameters obtained can be used to correct the error caused by the computations with low resolution of meshes. We show that the proposed method consumes significantly less computational effort than a traditional DNS, and can hopefully mitigate the limit by computational burden of the traditional conservation equation based simulations.

TI Transition from depth-to-surface filtration for a high-efficiency,

ID LAYER
AB Nano-aerosols, less than 100 nm, are present in high concentration in air in the millions per cubic meter both indoor and outdoor. By virtue of their small size, they are easily inhaled into our body and can lead to chronic diseases. Nanofiber filter is effective in capturing these nano-aerosols suspended in air. Understanding the pressure drop behavior during aerosol loading of nanofiber filter is important for the operation of these filters. Given these filters are highly efficient for capturing nano-aerosols, over aerosol loading they can change from depth filtration, for which aerosols are captured inside the filter, to surface filtration, for which a cake forms on the filter surface that ultimately becomes the effective filter media. This transition, which is important in operation of nanofiber filters, is largely not understood. This study fulfills such unmet needs by investigating experimentally and theoretically the transition from depth-to surface-filtration of nanofiber filter challenged by nano-aerosols. Initially, filtration occurs across the filter that quickly leads to most filtration taking place in the upstream thin skin layer facing the incoming flow. As flowable pores in the skin layer get blocked, aerosols "bridge" across the pore openings and subsequently build-up above the filter surface. A new bridging model is developed that characterize this behavior. The bridge of aerosols among adjacent pores starts to interact at the filter surface that eventually leads to a continuous aerosol cake layer forming across the filter. Experiments are conducted using 50-400 nm sodium chloride aerosols challenging high-efficiency nanofiber filters (>50% for 300 nm sodium chloride challenging aerosol) that exhibit transition change from depth-to surface-filtration under accelerated loading condition. The new model not only matches well the test data in the depth-surface transition regime, it also predicts correctly the concave downward behavior of the pressure-drop test data. It also provides a smooth transition to the cake filtration for which the pressure drop varies linearly with deposited aerosol mass. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This work presents a validation study of new filtered Two Fluid Model closures for interphase momentum exchange and mesoscale solids stresses. Good quantitative comparisons to experimental data were achieved over a wide range of fluidization velocities. The new models also showed good grid independence behaviour compared to two benchmark models from literature. These encouraging results in realistic 3D flows were achieved even though the models were derived from 2D resolved simulations. Comparisons to a benchmark model derived from 3D simulations suggests that it may be more accurate to derive filtered models from resolved simulations conducted in a large 2D domain than from resolved simulations in a small 3D domain. Furthermore, the new model validated in this work could achieve good results in wall-dominated flows without the use of specialized wall corrections. Further work is therefore recommended to test these new filtered models in more flow situations and to further assess the ability of filtered models derived in 2D to predict real 3D flows.

AB In this paper we develop a computational model for the mixing and transport of a dilute biomass slurry. The objective was to create a sufficiently simple and efficient model for biomass transport that can be coupled with reaction models for the study of conversion of cellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars. Our target system is 5%-by-mass alpha-cellulose, which is our proxy for more complex lignocellulosic biomass. In the authors' previous work, an experimental investigation with alpha-cellulose under two vane-mixer configurations showed a bifurcation between a settling regime, for which settling effects dominate, and a suspended regime, for which solids are mostly suspended. Here, a mixed-fluid model was chosen, for which the model for the mixture-velocity field is the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations under the Boussinesq approximation for buoyancy. Solids transport includes solids motion due to diffusion, settling, advection, and shear. Comparison of simulated and experimental results show good agreement in the suspended regime, and in capturing the bifurcation rate. While the model captured well the distribution of solids in the settling regime, the model was incapable of capturing the high torque values seen in experiments with vanishing mixer rotation rate.

AB In this study the condensation phenomena inside an inclined smooth tube were investigated. The tube internal diameter was 8.38 mm, and its length was 1488 mm. The condensing fluid was R134a at a saturation temperature of 40 degrees C. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) multiphase-flow formulation was utilized to solve the governing equations of continuity, momentum, energy and turbulence. The flow field was assumed to be unsteady, turbulent and three-dimensional. The fluid properties were considered to be constant as temperature changes were negligible. The effects on heat transfer coefficients of various parameters were investigated. These parameters included tube inclination angle, vapour quality, refrigerant mass flux, and flow regimes. Simulations were conducted at a heat flux of approximately 5 kW/m(2), mass fluxes of 100-600 kg/m(2).s, while the inclination angles of flow were varied between vertical downward, to vertical upward. The results of the simulations were compared to an experimental database and a good agreement was found with the experimental data. The numerical simulations gave new perspectives and complementary information that was not determined experimentally. The results showed that an optimum downward inclination angle of between -30 degrees and -15 degrees exists, for the heat transfer coefficients. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The hydrodynamic behavior of a bubbling gas-solid fluidized bed with vertically immersed membrane tubes has been studied using an endoscopic-laser PIV/DIA technique. The solids mass flux and hold-up profiles were determined together with the bubble phase properties (equivalent bubble diameter and bubble rise velocity) for different operating conditions and different membrane bundle configurations. The obtained results revealed that the lateral solids motion can be significantly hampered due to the presence of the membrane tubes resulting in a very high solids hold-up near the walls and much diluted regions in the middle of the bed. The obtained results from the experiments with a different number of membranes, membranes with a different outer diameter, and positioned with the bottom of the bundle at different axial positions in the bed, give guidelines to optimize the membrane configurations to achieve the highest lateral gas dispersion and optimal bubble breakage. These experimental results have also demonstrated the very important effect of tube spacers on the hydrodynamics. Moreover, the analysis of the bubble phase properties confirmed the enormous decrease in equivalent bubble diameter (up to a factor 3.5) for fluidized beds with immersed vertical membranes with spacers in comparison with a fluidized bed without internals, showing the great potential for improvement of the bubble-to-emulsion phase mass transfer rate.

AB Photoelectrocatalytic degradation of target molecules on nanotubular titanium dioxide (TiO2) immobilized on meshed conductive substrate was assessed by measuring the photoelectrochemical response (i.e., generated photocurrent) as indicator of TiO2 performance. Furthermore, a simple and reliable methodology for degradation modelling and laboratory reactor optimization has been proposed and validated. Nanotubular TiO2 was grown by anodic oxidation of Ti wire meshes and characterized by ESEM and XRD. Immobilized TiO2 on Ti wire mesh was used as photo-anode under UV irradiation (254 nm) and subjected to electrical polarization. The photocurrent was monitored in a three-electrode cell, by varying polarization voltage, TiO2 electrode relative positioning to the UV source (distance), and concentration of a model azo dye compound (Reactive Red 243, RR243). Photoelectrochemical response was modelled as a function of operating parameters and guidelines for photoreactor configuration were identified. Optimized batch photoreactor configuration (1.8 L) was used for degrading a 25 mg L (1) RR243 aqueous solution, achieving 90% decolorization in 45 min and 60% mineralization in 100 min. Decolorization kinetics were effectively described by means of a modified Langmuir-Hinshelwood model based on experimentally measured photocurrents, accounting for the dynamic behaviour of the process due to the change in solution transmittance over time determined by the degradation of target compounds.

AB Filtered two-fluid formulations of gas-solid fluidized flows require closure models to deal with sub-grid filtered parameters, which have been derived from filtering over results of meso-scale highly resolved simulations with two-fluid modeling. Trusting on scale separation, the correlation of filtered parameters has been performed to meso-scale filtered data only, disregarding any macro-scale effects. In this work, the correctness of such practice is tested, and it fails. Two macro-scale parameters associated to flow topology, namely the average solid volume fraction and the average gas Reynolds number, are both considered as for their effects over relevant filtered parameters. This is done by filtering over results of highly resolved simulations, where the concerning macro-scale parameters are held constant at various levels. The current interest is directed towards dilute conditions typical of riser flows. Results show that both the concerning macro-scale parameters should be accounted for in sub-grid correlation if higher accuracy is pursued. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The practical applications of some advanced carbon nanomaterials in supercapacitors are still hampered by the resource scarcity and high cost. It arouses great interest to seek for ample and low-cost substitutes to meet the need of upcoming large-scale productions. The chemical conversion of renewable and abundant biomass provides a good opportunity for the economic and sustainable synthesis of carbon based electrode materials. In this work, activated ginkgo leaf-derived carbons were investigated as porous cheap biomass carbons with utility as supercapacitor electrode materials in the acid electrolyte. The influences of KOH-, ZnCl2-, and H3BO3-activations on the composition, morphology and performance of as-prepared carbons were studied and discussed. Benefiting from the superior electrochemical activity endowed by the hierarchical nano-architecture and abundant oxygen-containing groups, the as-obtained KOH- activated ginkgo leaf-derived carbon material exhibited the best specific capacitance (374F g (1) at 0.5 A g (1)) relative to pristine carbon, ZnCl2-, and H3BO3-activated carbons. And this KOH-activated ginkgo leaf-derived carbon in the two-electrode configuration also demonstrated satisfactory specific capacitance (272F g (1) at 0.2 A g (1)) and cycling reliability. Moreover, these performances also outperform those of some similar carbon materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pichia pastoris is a well-known host for the production of heterologous proteins, but the incorporation of a foreign gene may lead to metabolic burden and sub optimal folding of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cytoplasm, ultimately resulting in reduced protein secretion. The Hsp70 and Hsp40 chaperone families in the cytoplasm/ER are required to ensure proper folding and translocation of heterologous proteins. In the present study, we have cloned a gene encoding human interferon gamma in Pichia pastoris (GS115) resulting in a very low expression of recombinant human interferon gamma (rhIFN-gamma). To evaluate the role of chaperones in protein production we have co-expressed SEC63P, YDJ1P, SSA1P, KAR2P and PDI genes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris (X-33) respectively. The introduction of individual chaperones viz., Ydj1p, PDI and Ssa1p have enhanced rhIFN-gamma production about 4 folds, while the synergistic effect of Kar2p + PDI has shown about 6-fold enhancement in rhIFN-gamma production. The batch reactor kinetics with complex medium showed that the product is growth associated and maximum production yield of 1.98 mg L (1) was observed at a 72 hr time interval. To evaluate the efficacy of rhIFN-gamma on an anti-proliferative property, we have treated oral cancer cell lines with different concentration of rhIFN-gamma and found inhibition of cell proliferation up to 25% at 0.5 mg concentration.

AB High-accuracy gas dispersion models are necessary for predicting toxic gas movement, and for reducing the damage caused by toxic gas release accidents in chemical processes. In urban areas, where obstacles are large and abundant, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) would be the best choice for simulating and analyzing scenarios of accidental release of toxic chemicals. However, owing to the large computation time required for CFD simulation, it is inappropriate in emergency situations and in real-time alarm systems. In this study, a non-linear surrogate model based on deep learning is proposed using a variational autoencoder with deep convolutional layers and a deep neural network with batch normalization (VAEDC-DNN) for real-time analysis of the probability of death (P-death). VAEDC can extract representation features of the Pdeath contour with complicated urban geometry in the latent space, and DNN maps the variable space into the latent space for the Pdeath image data. The chlorine gas leak accident in the Mipo complex (city of Ulsan, Republic of Korea) is used for verification of the model. The proposed model predicts the Pdeath image within a mean squared error of 0.00246, and compared with other models, it exhibits superior performance. Furthermore, through the smoothness of image transition in the variable space, it is confirmed that image generation is not overfitting by data memorization. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A fast and economical solver, accelerated by the Graphics Process Units (GPU) of a single graphics card in a desktop computer, is developed for the simulation of stirred tanks, integrating Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), coherent Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Immersed Boundary Method (IBM). The grid resolution can reach 13.8 million nodes in maximum, resolving considerable details of flow field in stirred tanks with only such a simple desktop computer. In the meantime, the computational speed is 1500-fold faster than that of the traditional transient simulation of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based on Navier-Stokes equations implemented on 16 CPU cores. It only takes less than two minutes to update the simulation of one impeller revolution, enabling the transient simulation of longer physical time of stirred tanks. We find that at least 4000 impeller revolutions in simulation is needed to achieve an obviously time-independent macro-instability frequency. With the coherent LES model and reasonable grid resolution, the fast solver is able to resolve more than 95% of total Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) for highly turbulent region, reproducing the monotonic decrease of TKE along the radial direction, much better than the Smagorinsky model. The average velocity and TKE predicted by the fast solver are in better agreement with the experimental data in literature. The solver is therefore more suitable for the fast simulation of stirred tanks using only a desktop computer without the need of much finer grid resolution and supercomputers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We examined the kinetic and transport processes involved in the production of H-2 from water with Co2+ as the electroactive species being oxidized at a Ni electrode in 40 wt% KOH at 318 K. The relevant transport parameters such as electrochemical rate constants, transfer coefficients, diffusion coefficients, and adsorption coefficients were estimated from a combination of cyclic voltammetry experiments and numerical modeling. Fourteen parameters characterize the electrochemical reaction on a clean electrode, with the Butler-Volmer equation describing the electron transfer step to solution and to adsorption bound electroactive species. A Frumkin Isotherm describes the thermodynamics of the adsorption process. Experimentally realized anodic current densities at cell voltages below 1.23 V were circa 1 mA cm(-2), a hydrogen production level far too low for commercial viability of the solar thermal decoupled water electrolysis process. However, our 3-D finite element model of the electrochemical cell operating at 318 K, suggests that current densities approaching 20 mA cm(-2) can be reached in a cell with forced convection and a solvent that increases the solubility of CoO by a factor of 10 above that for KOH. Finally, the current density calculations from the perspective of industrial viability suggest producing porous metal anodes for which the actual surface area is 10-100 times larger than the electrode's planar area.

AB A novel amino acid ionic liquid-based deep eutectic solvent (TrpBF(4)/U) was synthesized using L-tryptophan, fluoroboric acid and urea. The melting point of TrpBF(4)/U was over 100 K lower than that of TrpBF(4). It is found that the TrpBF(4)/U could form non-aqueous surfactant-free micro-emulsion through mixing with ethanol and toluene. The size of the micro-emulsion droplets was less than 7 nm and was dependent on the concentration of toluene. This newly prepared TrpBF(4)/U-based micro-emulsion was applied to extract the extra-heavy oil from carbonate asphalt rocks. Results showed that the oil recovery was enhanced by at least 11% compared with that without the TrpBF(4)/U micro-emulsions. The enhancement in the oil-solid separation was mainly ascribed to the interfacial alteration at the oil and mineral surfaces by the TrpBF(4)/U, including lowering the interfacial tension and increasing solid wettability. Assisted by the TrpBF(4)/U micro-emulsion, the quality of oil product (less solids entrained) and residual solids (less solvents attached) were also improved compared with traditional ionic liquids (i.e., [Emim] BF4) at given conditions. It also demonstrated that the TrpBF(4)/U micro-emulsion could be recycled and reused at least 4 times without sacrificing its efficiency. The above findings suggested the potential applications of the amino acid ionic liquid-based deep eutectic solvent in oil-solid separations or other extractions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents a series of numerical simulation on solid-liquid two-phase flow in cross fractures based on the Two-Fluid Model and the kinetic theory of granular flow (KTGF). First, the model is validated by previous experimental data. Second, the dimensionless controlling parameters are derived to describe the particle-laden flow in cross fractures, including the angle between the main and branch slots (bypass angle) theta, inlet particle volume fraction alpha(s0), the ratio of particle size to branch slot width d(s)/w(b), the Archimedes number Ar and the Reynolds number Re. Third, the effects of the dimensionless parameters are investigated. The results show that particles tend to accumulate at the intersection between the main slot and the branch slot. Larger bypass angle between the main slot and branch slot leads to less particle's flow into the branch slot. The distance of the branch fracture from the inlet of the main fracture induces different particle-flow characteristics into the branch slot. Particle volume fraction at the stable stage increases with the decrease of d(s)/w(b). The deposition thickness of particles increases with the increase of the inlet volume fraction and Ar number, while decreases with the increase of Re number. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, various configurations of vapor recompression and bottom flashing systems were developed. The systems were developed based on direct sequence, indirect sequence, Petlyuk and side stripper designs. This research was performed with three main aims. First aim was to investigate possibility of enhancing energy and economic performance of complex three-product distillation systems via implementation of vapor recompression and bottom flashing. Second aim was to shed light on differences in potentials of vapor recompression and bottom flashing systems in energy and costs savings of three-product distillation schemes. Third aim was to name the best configuration of three-product separation schemes from economic and energy points of view. Twelve configurations were designed. Energy and costs requirements of each configuration were evaluated and compared to each other. Based on the presented results, implementation of vapor recompression and bottom flashing systems can lead to better economic performance of complex three-product distillation systems. In case study presented in this work, application of vapor recompression and bottom flashing enhanced performance of direct sequence, indirect sequence, Petlyuk and side stripper designs. Equivalent work requirements of base direct sequence separation system was 5.59 MW. Based on the obtained results, considering energy requirements, Side stripper and Petlyuk arrangements are the best options for separation of the three-product system with equivalent work savings of 27.6 and 23.5%, respectively. Considering equivalent mechanical work of the systems, the highest savings was obtained in Side stripper with VRC heat pump (71.3% saving). It is shown that the most economically attractive configuration is Petlyuk with bottom flashing with total annual costs (TAC) saving of 43.4% (compared to 9.58 mUSD/year TAC of the base case), while the best performances of vapor recompression systems were obtained on Petlyuk and side stripper designs with TAC savings of 37.4 and 31.0%, respectively.

AB A kinetic experimental study of the catalytic partial oxidation of propane was performed in an isothermal "catalytic jet stirred reactor" which has the ability to modify the ratio of the catalyst surface to the gas volume. The main goal of this study was to elucidate the detailed heterogeneous-homogeneous mechanism of this reaction and explore the capacity to produce H-2. The catalyst used in this study was pellets of cerium oxide CeO2. Various operating parameters were considered: temperature, residence time, contact time and amount of catalyst. A hetero-homogeneous mechanism, composed of 71 elementary steps at the catalyst surface and 937 homogeneous gas phase reactions is proposed and validated by comparison between experimental results and simulated results over a large range of temperatures (200 < T < 800 degrees C), residence times (2 < tau < 6 s), number of catalyst pellets (0-8). The interactions between gas phase reactions and surface reactions are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Villermaux/Dushman competing parallel reactions are modeled into a multiphase/multicomponent lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to theoretically investigate the interplay between mixing and reactions in droplet-based microfluidics. To quantify the mixing and reaction efficiency inside the droplets, the standard deviation sigma representing the pure mixing performance without reaction and the segregation index Xs reflecting mixing index with simultaneous chemical reactions are calculated based on the simulation results. The results show that the species transport can be evidently intensified by matching the flow recirculation and the appropriate initial distribution of reactants. We further demonstrate that the reaction selectivity could be improved by tuning droplet flow conditions or adding internal baffles to arbitrarily adjust the position of recirculation inside droplet.

AB When the meniscus of a polymer solution with a volatile solvent recedes over a wettable substrate, a polymer layer is deposited onto it. Even for chemically homogeneous and topographically flat substrates and constant coating speeds, the layer can exhibit quasi-periodic line patterns extending parallel to the contact line of the liquid meniscus. In this manuscript, we study such unstable solution deposition processes by means of well-controlled, systematic experiments and numerical simulations. The presence of laminar forced air convection gives rise to a linear increase in the average layer thickness with air flow rate. Initially, the line patterns increase in width and height with increasing air flow rate. However, beyond a certain critical value the coating instability is suppressed. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB To address the incapability of using a single model to monitor multiphase batch processes with varying characteristics in different phases, a sequential local-based Gaussian mixture model (GMM) building method is proposed in this paper to improve monitoring performance. A multiphase process is divided into stable phases and transition phases in terms of the time sequence for sampling. Samples in local regions are used to partition each phase via two types of models, initial model and mixture model. Meanwhile, an adaptive iteration strategy is developed to properly determine stable phases including the in-between transition phases. Based on the partitioned phases, a localized probability index is introduced for process monitoring. A numerical example and a fed-batch penicillin fermentation process are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and merit of the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigates an ethanol liquid jet subjected to combination of an air crossflow and a normal electric field. The results on the liquid jet trajectory and subsequent droplets flight paths are presented. The liquid jet trajectory was found as a function of two non-dimensional quantities; the liquid jet to the crossflow momentum ratio and the electroinertial number. The electroinertial number is defined as the ratio between the liquid jet specific momentum and the electric force. A correlation is introduced for the jet trajectory in low crossflow speeds and electric field intensities. The same two quantities control the detached droplets flight paths. Satellite droplets flight angles are also reported with a correlation for their separation angle, which can be useful in applications where uniform droplet production is important.

AB The telomerization of 1,3-dienes with functionalized nucleophiles presents an atom efficient and selective synthesis of potential non-ionic surfactants. Crucial for application of these synthetic pathways is the effective recycling of the homogeneous palladium catalyst. In this work, we present the telomerization of 1,3-butadiene with the renewable aminopolyol N-methylglucamine to a non-ionic surfactant in an aqueous solvent system. In order to achieve phase separation, the addition of freshly added 1,3-butadiene instead of an additional solvent offers an elegant way of catalyst recycling. With this method, recycling of the catalyst is feasible; a total turnover number of 1456 was reached. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article addresses the problem of output feedback control of dissipative distributed parameter systems. The reduced order model used for controller and observer synthesis is recursively updated using a revised version of adaptive proper orthogonal decomposition (APOD), based on decomposing spatially discrete solution profiles. This approach eliminates the basis size oscillation resulting from the inaccuracy of estimation of energy in APOD when the sampling speed is too slow. The performance of this method is illustrated by applying it to regulate a diffusion-reaction process and a fluid flow system described by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.

AB Understanding of transport phenomena in fluid-fluid two-phase systems is essential for many engineering applications. When evaporation or condensation is considered, there exists a two-way coupling of momentum, heat and species transfer, i.e. the fluid flow influences the heat and species transfer and vice versa. The CFD-based simulation of evaporating and/or condensing flows requires models and numerical solution techniques for two-way coupled transport equations and their boundary conditions. Most results on transport phenomena in systems with phase change available in the literature are restricted by either isothermal or one-component systems. Recently we have proposed an approach for modelling and simulation of two-way coupled transport phenomena in non-isothermal two-phase binary systems and performed a first validation using some one-dimensional problems (Rieks and Kenig, 2018). In the present work, a further, more sound validation of the new model and simulation code is accomplished to govern two-dimensional systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study presents measurements of droplet transport inside a rotor-stator mixer under turbulent flow conditions and contributes to the understanding of the droplet breakup phenomenon. The measurements contain unique information on droplet breakup down to the limit of equilibrium droplet size. The experimental setup includes a custom-built rotor-stator mixer that provides optical access to the mixing region. High-speed camera imaging is used to study droplet stability and breakup due to turbulent inertial stress at different operating conditions. The analysis reveals when, where, and how the droplets break up inside the rotor-stator mixer. Analysis of the breakup location reveals that droplet breakup mainly occurs in the downstream region of the stator and inside the emanating jets. Prediction of the flow field and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate from CFD simulations explains the propensity of droplet breakup at different locations in the rotor-stator. It is found that both the average time for droplet-vortex interaction and the distribution increases with the size of mother droplets, and a model is proposed that explains the results fairly well. Measurement of the breakup probabilities reveals a monotonically increase from zero probability at a low We-number to approximately 50% probability at We > 4. The number of fragments formed upon breakage depend on how far the droplets are from equilibrium size and it is found that the probability for multiple fragmentation dominates even close to the equilibrium size.

AB Recently, a new model for the reactive mass transfer during absorption of CO2 in aqueous NaOH was developed, based on using a rather generally applicable expression for the enhancement factor and taking into account the reaction of CO2 with water in addition to that with hydroxide ions (Krauss and Rzehak, 2017). By substituting the interfacial area concentration estimated from experimental data, good agreement was found for the pointwise measurement of time-dependent pH-value in a bubble column taken from the literature (Darmana et al., 2007). In the present contribution, this mass transfer model is implemented in an Euler-Euler/RANS framework including also the hydrodynamic part of the problem. Hydrodynamic closures were taken the same as applied successfully for a range of different conditions in previous work. However, the accuracy of the coupled model in predicting the measured pH-value is seen to fall behind that of the simple pointwise approximation. This suggests that for the present application, the hydrodynamic part of the model requires further improvement. Possible directions to this end are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Two flow configurations, involving bilayers, are explored systematically: through an inclined channel comprised of two planar surfaces in parallel alignment and down an inclined plane. Both liquid layers are assumed to be perfectly immiscible and the lower rigid bounding surface contains locally defined steep-sided topographical features - either a step-up/-down or a trench/peak. A common governing equation-set based on the long-wave approximation and depth-averaging is derived, embodying the more general case of a system of n-layers, and solved numerically.
   Results for the particular case of flow in a vertically aligned channel are found to be indistinguishable from corresponding solutions in the literature; those for the case of a step-up and non-zero Reynolds number having not been reported hitherto. New to this, the case of flow in a inclined channel is investigated as is the situation when, in horizontal alignment, the channel's upper planar bounding surface moves with a constant speed inducing a shear flow.
   Gravity-driven bilayer film flow reveals a number of interesting features dependent on the fluid properties, the Reynolds number and the ratio of the upper to lower liquid layer thickness, with parallels drawn to the practically relevant cascade/slide-coating mode of multi-layer thin-film deposition. In the limit when both layers have identical properties the corresponding equivalent single layer solution is recovered exactly. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Highly water-selective hybrid pervaporation membranes with excellent water/ethanol separation performance and superior water channels were fabricated by incorporating graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), activated g-C3N4 (O-g-C3N4) and polydopamine modified g-C3N4 (PDA@O-g-C3N4) nanosheets into poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrix. The nonselective polymer/inorganic interface channels between PVA and g-C3N4, O-g-C3N4 and PDA@O-g-C3N4 in hybrid membranes were controllable constructed through hydrogen bonds, rigid and flexible chemical bonds, respectively. The membrane performances were tested in the pervaporation (PV) process for the dehydration of 90 wt% ethanol/water mixtures at 75 degrees C. The results revealed that with the increase of binding force among polymer/inorganic interface, from hydrogen bonds (CPVA-g-C3N4), to rigid (CPVA-O-g-C3N4) and flexible chemical bonds (CPVA-PDA@O-g-C3N4), the total flux decreased from 4634 to 2328 g/(m(2)h) and the separation factor increased from 32.4 to 57.9. It is implied that the nonselective polymer/inorganic interface channels were controlled successfully. Meanwhile, compared with the pure cross-linked PVA (CPVA) membrane (total flux 2325 g/(m(2)h) and separation factor 18.7), incorporation of g-C3N4, O-g-C3N4 and PDA@O-g-C3N4 could all lead to an increase of surface hydrophilicity of the CPVA membranes along with an increase in membrane tortuosity and membrane water-selective channels that was favorable to the selective permeation of water molecules. Namely, these new hybrid membranes can break the "trade-off effect" effectively. Moreover, due to the ordered alignment of g-C3N4, O-g-C3N4 and PDA@O-g-C3N4 nanosheets and the strong interfacial interactions among these nanosheets, succinic acid (Sa) and the PVA matrix, the hybrid composite membranes showed both high swelling resistance and mechanical stability.

AB This paper presents experimental results and predictive model on the air entrainment flow rate due to the vertical plunging liquid jet. Three types of fluids with different physical properties were utilized as a working fluid for the experiment. Air entrainment flow rate was measured using soap meniscus method and various geometrical parameters including nozzle diameter (13-16 mm), fall height (105-210 mm), pool depth (30-180 mm), and angle of the bottom pool surface (0-75 degrees) were changed to investigate the effects on air entrainment rate. Plunging tube was installed around the falling jet and impinging point. For the current experimental conditions, it was found that the air entrainment rate depends on the product of Weber number and Laplace length scale, and new predictive model on air entrainment ratio, defined as the entrained air flow rate divided by impinging jet flow rate, is proposed. The proposed model is capable of predicting air entrainment ratio at a mean absolute relative deviation of 15.9% at the given experimental conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An image analysis based method is developed in this work to quantitatively evaluate the mixing performance of a special soft-elastic reactor (SER), which promotes mixing through elastic wall movement. The source data collected are RGB values in each pixel of consecutive colour images taken by a CCD camera. The method can determine global indicators such as the average mixing level (i.e., the degree of homogeneity, uniquely characterized by the ''distance" away from the ideally mixed state) and the mixing time. More importantly, it allows tracking of localized mixing performance throughout the entire mixing process by quantifying spatial and frequency-domain distributions of the mixing level. This simple, generic, and cost-effective method should be a powerful tool for mixing performance evaluation of most reactors with a variety of mixing mechanisms. It can be readily applied in the future to improved design and optimized operation of the SER. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A new geometrical method for diffusion estimation in binary liquids is derived and validated. It incorporates the slope and intercept approach into the integral representation for diffusion. The method significantly improves the existing slope and intercept methods for estimation of the concentration dependent diffusion coefficients. It produces much more accurate diffusion estimations for non-constant diffusion. The slope and intercepts are calculated using the derivative approximation for deterministic concentration data, or the spline linear regression for measurement data containing noise. The verification of the proposed method is performed either by comparing estimated and known diffusion coefficients, or measured and calculated concentration profiles. The sensitivity analysis conducted with respect to the Matano interface position showed that for incorrect Matano interface values the diffusion are significantly overestimated or underestimated. The proposed iterative slope and intercept (ISI) method is applied for the toluene-bitumen binary liquid system with concentration profiles obtained using X-ray Computer Assisted Tomography.

AB The effect of an instantaneous chemical reaction on convective dissolution in a Hele-Shaw cell is analyzed experimentally and numerically. We experimentally show that the non-dimensional onset time and growth rate of instability is determined only by the reactant concentration-ratio. Also, nonlinear numerical simulations are conducted to obtain the temporal evolution of the dissolution flux. The experimental and numerical results reveal a sharp increase of up to 300% in the dissolution flux, accompanied by a decrease in the convection onset time, when the reactant concentration-ratio approaches the stoichiometric value. These results have important implications for the optimization of carbon-dioxide storage in porous saline aquifers in the Earth's subsurface. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The flow induced by a sphere rotating inside an incompressible, non-Newtonian, power law fluid has been investigated numerically. The rotating sphere is enclosed in a concentric cubic box with solid boundaries. The fluid power-law index varied between 0.2 and 2 thereby covering both shear-thinning and shear-thickening fluids and the Reynolds number varied between 0.01 and 10,000. Numerical predictions show significant differences between shear-thinning and shear-thickening fluids. In the first case the flow is confined near the sphere whereas in the second case the flow extends up to the box plates. In creeping flow and shear-thinning fluids the torque is independent of the Reynolds number. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Developing efficient catalytic packing for reactive distillation can push its application greatly forward. Structured Corrugation SiC Foam Packing is considered an attractive candidate with the rapid development of the coating method. However, liquid flow behavior on the packing and its radial and axial dispersion coefficients remain unclear. We studied herein liquid renewal on the structured corrugation SiC foam packing sheet by photography. The images revealed that the liquid could be constantly refreshed on most of the wetted area and the process can be categorized into two stages by the renewal rate. Effects of liquid flow rate, viscosity, and surface tension on the renewal process were investigated. The renewal results highlight the applicability of the foam packing at low liquid load. Furthermore, axial and radial dispersion coefficients of two foam packing sheets with different pore sizes were characterized, and comparisons with KATAPAK-S showed that the foam packing has better liquid dispersion ability.

AB High-energy-density (HED) liquid fuels are critical for volume-limited aerospace vehicles to extend the flight range and increase the payload, and can be used as an energetic additive for conventional fuels. This review will summarize the synthesis and properties of HED fuels along with challenges appearing especially in the past decade. The currently used multi-cyclic HED fuels are introduced first with a focus on more efficient and greener synthesis routes. Then the synthesis of new multi-cyclic, strained and caged fuels with higher energy is summarized, mainly including the reaction mechanism and catalysts involved. After that, HED biofuels synthesized from biomass feedstock including terpene, hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin are comprehensively reviewed. Nanofluid HED fuels are further introduced as an alternative way to increase the energy density of liquid fuels by adding energetic nanoparticles. Hypergolic energetic ionic liquids are then summarized as a special alternative for toxic and hazardous hydrazine. Finally we will emphasize the problems need to be resolved in the synthesis and application of HED fuels. This review article will be helpful to explore and develop better approach and process for HED-fuel synthesis and upgrade for advanced propulsion applications.

AB The field of electrical insulation has improved considerably after the introduction of the first synthetic polymeric dielectrics. However, these materials are often considered the "weakest link" as they tend to degrade and eventually fail, thus compromising the reliability of devices and equipment. Such degradation is related to the occurrence of partial discharges (PDs), a phenomenon that is difficult to measure in actual applications.
   In the present work, the chemical evolution of the gas phase composition and polyethylene degradation in a polyethylene microcavity subject to a PD were studied using a thermodynamic model. Thermodynamic parameters for the depolymerization of polyethylene into ethylene were obtained using density functional theory calculations. The system evolution is studied minimizing the Gibbs free energy subject to the constraints of energy conservation explicitly considering the polyethylene surface among the reacting species.
   The model results can be interpreted in terms of the density of energy introduced by the partial discharge. At low discharge energy densities methane and carbon monoxide are the most abundant species produced by the discharge. As the energy density increases the model predicts that ethylene is formed in the gas phase because of the depolymerization of the polymer. At high energy densities carbon may be formed at the surface. In these conditions, the most abundant gas phase species predicted by the model are methane, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, water, and carbon dioxide. This is in good agreement with experimental observations reported in the polyethylene PD literature. In addition, the model is able to correlate the energy of the partial discharge to the increase of volume of the microcavity, thus providing a tool that may be used to predict polymer degradation due to PDs dissipated power.

AB Fluidized beds are widely used in pharmaceutical industry for particles coating and granulation. Due to the complex gas solids flow process, it is extremely desirable that a real time monitoring and control system is used in the process in order to enable a bubbling stable fluidization and reduce the chance of defluidization due to agglomeration with high moisture contents particles. The microwave tomography (MWT) technology has been developed for more than twenty years and was mainly applied in medical sectors. MWT has a wide range of frequency (1-2.5 GHz) and can be used to measure materials with high permittivity and conductivity. Therefore, it is a good choice for the monitoring of fluidized bed coating and granulation processes. In this paper, a MWT system with 16 antennas was designed and applied for the monitoring of wetting and coating processes in a lab-scale fluidized bed with top-spray and bottom-spray system. The hydrodynamics characteristics of wet gas-solids flow with different moisture content were investigated by MWT technology. This is the first time that MWT was applied in a real dynamics gas-solids fluidized bed. Experiment result shows that the MWT is available for the online monitoring of the gas solids flow with different moisture content. Different flow regimes were revealed based on the MWT images combined with pressure signals. The results indicate that the MWT provides valuable information to identify the defluidization in the fluidized bed process with high moisture contents materials. It is evident that microwave tomography has clear advantages over single point based measurement technology for process fault diagnose. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Orientational structure and dynamics of molecules is known to be affected by confinement in space comparable in size to the molecule itself. ZSM-5 with porous channels of approximate to 0.55 nm is such a porous medium, which offers a strict spatial confinement on low molecular weight hydrocarbons. An important factor that determines these properties is the shape of the confined molecules. We employed molecular dynamics simulation to study the orientational structure and dynamics of four molecules that differ in shape but have similar kinetic diameters and moments of inertia, confined in ZSM-5. The effect of molecular shape on the orientational structure and dynamics of propane, acetonitrile, acetaldehyde and acetone in ZSM-5 is studied by means of probing the differences in the orientational distribution of molecules in the ZSM-5 channels, and extracting time scales of the decay of correlation functions related to rotational motion. Orientational correlation functions of all the four molecules exhibit two regimes of rotational motion. While the short time regime represents free rotation of the molecules before they collide with the pore walls, the long time orientational jumps driven by inter-channel migrations give rise to a very slow varying second regime. Of the molecules studied, orientational structure and dynamics of propane is found to be least affected by confinement under ZSM-5, whereas charge and shape asymmetry of other molecules makes their interchannel migration-driven rotation slow. The time scales involved in the rotational motion for the molecules studied are compared with similar studies reported in literature. This study reveals the important role that molecular shape plays in the behavior of confined molecules. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Spray drying as a commonly used process to produce amorphous solid dispersions of poorly water soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) involves dissolution of the API and often a polymer, surfactant, and/or other functional excipient(s) into a volatile solvent. This feed solution is then pumped to an atomizing nozzle to produce droplets inside the drying chamber. The current paper aims to utilize non-scaled parameters to characterize the atomization process. A bi-fluid nozzle with two different designs commonly used in a lab-scale spray dryer was investigated under different operating conditions. The feed solutions were made of several excipients commonly used to produce amorphous solid dispersion composites. Atomization characterization is presented via both mean droplet size and size distribution. Various models are evaluated for predicting droplet mean diameter and span suitable for extrapolating atomization in the spray drying process. These approaches may be extended to other nozzles and across scales. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Solid-liquid suspension of microcarriers in stirred tank bioreactor -

AB Solid-liquid suspensions in stirred tank reactors are common operations in many processes, including bioprocesses such as animal or stem cell cultures. These cells are often anchorage-dependent, i.e. they need to adhere to a surface to grow. Typically, they are cultivated on the surface of small spherical microbeads, the so-called microcarriers, suspended in stirred-tank bioreactors.
   As far as we know, no extensive experimental characterization, and thus no validated simulation approach, of microcarrier suspensions in stirred-tank reactor exists in the literature. Therefore, the first aim of this work is to develop an experimental technique based on light attenuation to characterize the spatial distribution of particle concentration for various particle suspension states. The second aim is to determine the validity of Euler-Euler CFD simulations to predict the spatial distribution of low density particles, such as microcarriers, in a stirred tank bioreactor.
   Experiments and simulations were performed in a small hemispherical bottom bioreactor stirred with a down-pumping axial impeller. The particles used were Cytodex-1 microcarriers (d(P) = 162 mu m and rho(S) = 1020 kg m(-3)) at a solid concentration of 10% in volume.
   The light attenuation technique enabled the characterization of the spatial distribution of the solid phase in the whole bioreactor, even for very dense suspensions by advantageously using the optical properties of the Cytodex-1 microcarriers. The analysis of the solid spatial distribution shows that the bioreactor volume can be divided in three distinct zones: a clear layer below the free surface where alpha(S,layer) tends to 0, a bulk zone where the solid phase is homogeneously distributed (alpha(S,bulk) <= <alpha S >) and a packed bed of motionless particles at the bottom (alpha(S,bed) = alpha(S,max)). One very interesting finding is that the evolution of the bulk solid concentration is directly proportional to the agitation rate and its value equals the averaged volume fraction alpha(S,bulk) = <alpha(S)> N = N-js.
   Concerning the simulation results, the modeling approach presented in this work enables a reasonable estimation of the just-suspended agitation rate N-js. Nevertheless, the solid spatial distributions are not well predicted for agitation rates below or above Njs.

AB Branched decalins are promising jet fuel components with high density, high thermal stability and low freezing point, but its accessibility is limited by fossil resources. Here we report a novel H2SO4 catalytic one-pot synthesis process using cyclic alcohols (cyclohexanol, cyclopentanol) and branched cycloalkanes (methylcyclohexane, methylcyclopentane) that can be derived from lignocellulose and/or refineries as feedstock. The reaction occurs in a consecutive way of dehydration, alkylation, rearrangement and hydrogen transfer to produce branched decalins. The dehydration/oligomerization of alcohols also produces branched cycloalkanes but the carbon yield and selectivity are very low, and the presence of branched cycloalkanes significantly improves the reaction. The reaction goes smoothly at room temperature and continuous feeding of alcohols can further increase the yield. Under optimized reaction conditions, the carbon yield and branched decalins selectivity vary in range of 61-87%, dependent on the reactants used. The branched decalins show good fuel properties like density as high as 0.88 g/mL and freezing point as low as -110 degrees C, and can be produced in large scale. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Investigating the influence of local porosity variations and anisotropy
   effects on the permeability of fibrous media for air filtration

AB The permeability prediction of real fibrous media remains a major challenge due to their complex porous structure. The existing models generally take two parameters into account that depict the average structural properties of fibrous media: porosity (or solid volume fraction) and fibre diameter (or radius). Due to the local variations that those parameters can exhibit the models often fail to accurately predict the permeability. In this study experimental data of three fibrous media of different porous structures employed in air filtration are used to assess numerous empirical and analytical models from the literature. It is found that all the models considered significantly under-predict the experimental permeability values. Special attention is given to the analytical Representative Unit Cell (RUC) model which is physically adaptable and can therefore be used to investigate the aforementioned discrepancies between model and experiment. Local porosity variations are investigated through a sensitivity analysis on the minimum and maximum solid volume fraction values. Incorporation of the porosity variations into the RUC model significantly reduces its under-prediction and may also serve as explanation for the discrepancies observed. An adaptation to the RUC model is proposed that takes into account the anisotropy effects as a result of the stacking of fibrous medium sheets into several layers and the increase in porosity as a result thereof. The adapted analytical model gives an indication on the factor to apply on the mean porosity in order to incorporate the anisotropy effect into the model prediction, and so reduce the observed under-predictions.

AB Liquid solid fluidized beds are widely applicable two-phase contactors by which solid and liquid phase constantly exchange energy/mass at the interface. In this paper, a new DEM simulation approach to analyse the hydrodynamic behaviour of fluidized beds has been introduced and validated. In this approach, a random liquid fluctuating velocity following a Gaussian distribution is used to simulate the fluid phase. The mean and standard deviation of the distribution were functions of the liquid velocity and bed concentration. The liquid fluctuating velocity was able to produce a random motion of the particle across the entire bed. This new methodology can predict bed expansion and porosity, particle mixing time and velocity as a function of liquid velocity. The simulation results revealed that using DEM only along with the simulation methodology presented in this study suffices to predict the hydrodynamics of a fluidized bed to a reasonable accuracy.

SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE

DE Diffusion; Water blocking; Moving mesh; Swelling; CO2 flooding
ID RESERVOIR OIL; CONTACT; FILM
AB During processes such as solvent-steam co-injection and tertiary CO2 flooding, oil may be prevented from direct contact with solvent by a water barrier which greatly affects microscopic displacement efficiency. As a result of diffusion through the water barrier, both oil and water phases swell progressively. If oil swelling displaces the blocking water completely, direct contact between solvent and oil can be achieved which results in high oil recovery. In this study, a moving mesh technique is applied to simulate swelling of a trapped oil blob by CO2 diffusion through a blocking water at pore scale. A moving interface between oil and water is considered to track the swelling process. The modeling results were validated with micromodel experiments on the recovery process of water-shielded oil in a dead-end pore. The water film rupture time for typical oil and water thicknesses (in micro scale) was calculated using experimental data for oil-water-CO2 system. Finally, a dimensionless rupture time was introduced and it was used to predict trapped oil recovery as a function of contact time for various pore body and throat size distributions. The results can be used to estimate the time scales necessary for having maximum trapped oil recovery. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Emulsions have been widely applied in subterranean enhanced oil recovery processes, cosmetics and chemistry engineering fields, etc. Current research interests are focusing on improving the stability of emulsion by involving surfactants or colloidal materials. This work aims to enhance the emulsion stabilization by introducing silica nanoparticles (SNP) surface-hydrophobilized/hydrophilized by adding dimethyldodecylamine oxide (OA-12) and to reveal the dynamic behaviors of such composites on the liquid-liquid interface. The synergistic effect between SNPs and OA-12 in solution and on oil/water interface were studied by measuring the zeta potential, interfacial rheology and emulsion viscoelastic rheology, etc. It was found that the oil/water interface viscoelastic modulus are augmented by modified silica nano-particles and at the same time emulsions acquired significant long-time stability. Furthermore, phase transformation was induced with the increase of the concentration ratio between OA-12 and silica nano-particle, the emulsion type change from o/w, then to w/o and back to o/w. It is suggested that the inversions are induced by the mounting adsorption of OA-12 molecules on SNPs, which changes the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance of particle surfaces. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Rheological behaviors of a droplet moving in the micro-channel with a linear obstacle off the channel axis are investigated numerically by employing Volume of Fluid methods. Five different hydrodynamic patterns of the rheological behaviors of the droplet have been observed. The effects of the length ratio L of the mother droplet to the linear obstacle on the critical capillary number of the droplet breakup have been particularly studied. When L is less than a critical value L-min, the larger the droplet is, the smaller the critical capillary number Ca-cr is; when L is greater than Lmin, the larger the droplet is, the greater Cacr is. The curve of Cacr as a function of L has a minimum point at Lmin, which means that the droplet with L = L-min could be broken up most easily. This is caused by the competition of the enhancing (positive) factors and the hindering (negative) factors on the droplet breakup, which has been analyzed carefully in this paper. When other parameters are fixed, it is very interesting to find out that the change of the obstacle length does not change the value of Lmin, which is fixed to 0.66 for the conditions discussed in this paper. The results obtained here might enlighten potential applications for the design of the micro-channel with obstacles and the packing rings in columns. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Agitation of highly viscous shear thinning fluids is normally conducted with complex impeller designs. Often, impellers almost as large as the tanks containing them and impeller blades equipped with holes are adopted in industry. In this work, we studied experimentally the main features of the flow generated by this type of impellers for a mixture of glycerol with a carbomeric gel by means of particle image velocimetry. The experiments were conducted at temperatures ranging from 40 to 60 degrees C and impeller speeds ranging from 40 to 140 rpm. In all cases, the flow regime was laminar or in the transition region. We also used computational fluid dynamics simulations to describe the behaviour of the mixer, validating the results experimentally with good agreement. We used the numerical results to obtain information on the performance of the mixer, determining the locations and size of vigorous agitation zones and the local effect of the holes present on the impeller blades. The power curves of the mixer were obtained, and the mixer efficiency in terms of power consumption was found to be similar to other impellers used to mix highly viscous non-Newtonian fluids.

AB This work represents a mathematical model for a typical PEM fuel cell operated with non-precious carbon-based materials as ORR catalysts. The PEM fuel cell is operated at a practical single-cell condition, thus the reactant transport issues are taken into account. The model includes majority of critical significant physical and electrochemical processes during operation. The catalyst layer is assumed to be constructed by carbon agglomerates, in which the active sites for ORR are uniformly embedded and distributed. The catalyst loading, catalyst to ionomer mass ratio and catalyst layer porosity are numerically studied. Results reveal the significance of reactant transport within the carbon agglomerates, indicating the vital important role of primary pores for reactant transport and cell performance. It is found that the initial increase in catalyst loading and porosity improves the cell performance. However, their further increment results in limited improvement due to the elevated mass transport resistance in a thickened catalyst layer. Higher catalyst to ionomer ratio decreases the cell performance at low and medium current densities. The catalyst effectiveness can be improved with low catalyst loading, high catalyst layer porosity and catalyst to ionomer mass ratio. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Spin casting of mixtures of nonvolatile polymeric solutes dissolved in volatile solvents is studied experimentally and theoretically. The final solute coverage, time-resolved film thinning, time-resolved solvent evaporation, and evolution of the solute concentration within the thinning film is investigated for various combinations of different polymers (PMMA, PS, PS-b-PMMA) and different solvents (toluene, ethylacetate) for a wide range of polymer concentrations and spin cast conditions. The comprehensive data unveil a clear picture of the spin cast process. The findings are translated into a concise theoretical description. Easily available bulk properties of the solvent/solute mixture plus a single "calibration" experiment are sufficient for a quantitative description of the spin cast process including a prediction of the final solute coverage. This and the well-specified boundary conditions render the approach useful for practical applications. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Reactive dividing wall columns (RDWC) are a highly integrated column type. The coupling of a reactive distillation and a dividing wall column leads to complex interactions between vapor-liquid mass transfer, chemical kinetics and component split around the dividing wall. In simulation studies such interactions have been shown to lead to complex dynamics and the occurrence of multiple steady states. However, experimental investigations are still missing to verify the theoretical findings. In this work the first comprehensive experimental study of the dynamic behavior of RDWCs is presented. The reference system of enzymatic catalyzed butyl acetate transesterification with hexanol has been employed to investigate the start-up and open loop behavior under different operating conditions. Two different start-up strategies are tested and compared. The experiments demonstrate the reliable and secure start-up and stable operation of a RDWC. Additionally, a developed rigorous dynamic RDWC model is presented that considers the dynamic influence on the vapor distribution in the dividing wall section. A detailed model validation is carried out using the obtained experimental data. The comparison of simulation results and experimental values show good agreement over a wide range of operating conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The implementation of membrane-based separation for olefin/paraffin mixtures has the potential to significantly reduce energy consumption, but is limited by the lack of suitable membrane materials with desired performance and low cost. Here, mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) fabricated from incorporating ZIF-8 nanocrystals into the poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) matrix exhibit significant improvement of propylene/propane permeability and selectivity as well as the operating stability. On the 39 wt% ZIF-8/PVAc MMMs, both the C3H6 permeability and C3H6/C3H8 selectivity are about 10-fold increase over pure PVAc. The gas transportation mechanism through ZIF-8/PVAc MMMs was also evaluated. The favorable interfacial interaction between the H of the imidazole in the ZIF-8 and ester groups of PVAc enhances the mechanical strength and plasticization resistance of the neat polymer membrane. Therefore, the newly developed composite membrane may have great potential for industrial C3H6/C3H8 separation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Combining cryogenic flash units with membrane units is attractive for gas separation processes such as effluent gas recovery and CO2 capture. However, systematic design methodology for such hybrid systems have not been reported yet. The hybrid system is a complicated system that not only includes separation units, but also includes pressure manipulation units and heat exchangers. A two-step decomposition strategy is proposed to deal with the design of such complicated system. The separation sequence is first determined with energy consumption consideration in the first step. Subsequently, the remaining energy recovery units, the heat exchanger network and turbines are simultaneously synthesized with the separation flowsheet optimization. When applying the proposed strategy to recover the effluent gas from polyolefin plant, we find a novel flowsheet that avoid intensive capital and operating cost by tightly integration of process units.

AB A coupled finite volume-discrete element (FVM-DEM) numerical method is developed to investigate oscillating multiphase foulant-laden air (solid-gas) flow and particulate fouling in a porous heat exchanger channel comprising an array of circular cylinders. Oscillatory fluids serve as a steppingstone to advance existing conventional anti-fouling techniques and to yield optimum energy consumption. A performance evaluation criteria based on various amplitudes of pulsation and foulant injection rates is established. The fouling characteristics and pressure drop is compared against a non-oscillating steady flow. For the solid foulant particles considered in this study, the results show that the time-averaged deposition fraction is sensibly invariant with increasing foulant injection rate; however, the same observation is not realized for steady-flow cases. The 1 Hz case showed no significant disparity in terms of deposition fraction at high injection rates compared with the non-oscillating steady flow case. In addition, the 1 Hz case showed miniscule reduction of low-density foulants. The higher-frequency spectrum has superior fouling mitigation capabilities although comparatively higher pressure drop is generated. The 6-pore configuration outperforms the 3-pore under certain oscillatory flow conditions. An optimum frequency of 5 Hz exhibits superior fouling mitigation performance while achieving a low time-averaged pressure drop. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Continuum methods require the additional development of solids stress closures for polydisperse powders based on complex kinetic theories that are non-trivial to develop, code, and numerically converge for the wide range of fluidization regimes from very dilute to dense/frictional flow limit. On the other hand, it is straightforward to model the flow of polydisperse granular materials by treating particles as discrete rigid bodies that are tracked following simple physical laws of motion. The coarsening of these discrete methods by lumping several particles in a parcel alleviates the significant computational cost associated with these discrete methods while introducing some inaccuracies in the numerical results. In this research, we explore two different coarse graining methods that can be applied to polydisperse powders, namely the same statistic weight method (SSW) and the same size parcel method (SSP), and assess their accuracy by comparison with the finest simulation results obtained with a discrete element method (DEM). For Geldart group B powders fluidized at a relative low superficial velocity, the numerical results indicate that the SSW is more accurate than the SSP method. For type A powders fluidized at relatively high velocity, these two methods predict similar results. Interestingly, up to four times increase in the speed of simulation of the SSP method was obtained because the original polydisperse powder is scaled to a mono-disperse system in terms of particle-particle collision. These results suggest that the SSP method is more favorable for the simulation of fluidized beds due to its accuracy and efficiency while the SSW method may be used for granular flow and dense fluidized bed systems where capturing the size segregation of particles due to collision is important.

AB The depletion of oil reserves pushes the development of platform chemicals from biomass, as an alternative for the sustainable progress of the chemical industry. Cellulose, which is the main component of biomass, is widely studied for its conversion into value-added chemicals. However, due to its recalcitrant nature, hydrolysis of cellulose with solid alkali catalysts still remains a challenge. Thus, the conversion of cellulose using hydrotalcites as catalyst was investigated. For this purpose, hydrotalcites were deposited on cellulose fibers and their catalytic behavior was tested at 180 degrees C, for 1 h, using microwave reactor (300 W). Hydrotalcites proved to efficiently convert cellulose into value-added products such as lactic, acetic, formic and glycolic acids. Catalysts were characterized by X-Ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, environmental scanning electron microscopy and BET surface area analysis. The best conversion yield of up to 30% was obtained over calcined hydrotalcites at 400 degrees C. The basic properties of the hydrotalcite materials have an important effect on the activity. Hence, in this study hydrotalcites are presented as a promising catalyst for cellulose hydrolysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ceria-modified iron oxide exhibits high redox performance superior to that of pure iron oxide, which can inhibit the deactivation caused by sintering of materials. In the present work, the ceria-modified iron oxide is investigated as an oxygen carrier for hydrogen production via chemical-looping water splitting process (CLWS). To identify the role of CeO2, the performance evolution and element migration of the mixed oxides during redox cycling were discussed in detail. Comparing the obvious deactivation of pure iron oxide sample, ceria-modified iron oxide shows relative constant production of hydrogen during the successive recycling water splitting. FeCe20 sample with a CeO2 mole percent of 20% shows the highest average yield of hydrogen (8651 mu mol/g) with a Fe average oxygen recovery rate of 67.7% among Fe-Ce mixed oxides with different Ce molar percentage (x = 0, 10, 20 and 40%). In spite of materials sintering, the oxygen releasing/acquiring capacity and reactivity of Fe-Ce mixed oxides are three times higher than that of pure iron oxide after redox treatment. This can be ascribed to the preferable dispersion of Ce-based sub-micro particles (CeO2 and CeFeO3) and enhanced Fe-Ce interactions generated from active sites at the contact interface between iron oxides (mainly Fe3O4 particles) and Ce-based sub-micro particles (CeO2 and CeFeO3) after cycling.

AB In a pseudo-2D fluidized bed, a new color particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) method, integrating the Voronoi tracking algorithm and the relaxation probability tracking algorithm, is proposed to measure velocities of individual particles with different sizes marked by distinguishable colors. Thorough verification of the color-PTV methodology is conducted based on synthetic images generated from CFD-DEM simulation data, in terms of segmentation bias, segmentation ratio, recovery ratio and error ratio. The novel color-PTV methodology shows very good performance in simultaneously tracking a large number of different individual particles in poly-disperse systems. Experimental results are used to compare with CFD-DEM simulations using different drag models. Simulations with correction for the effect of particle size dispersity in the drag model show significantly better agreement with respect to the mixing index, time-averaged volumetric particle flux, distributions of individual particle velocity as well as distributions of particle granular temperature.

AB Metastable clathrate hydrates are a promising energy source in the shallow geosphere and present challenges in flow assurance, energy storage, and carbon capture sequestration. While they have been widely studied, little pertinent data is available for common propane hydrates concerning hydrate phase composition, nor its volume or the amount of converted water. This was the initial motivation for our work. Therefore, with a novel technique, propane hydrate composition and volume were measured dynamically at non-equilibrium conditions over time and at the final states for slow and quick rates of crystallization. Surprisingly, equilibrium pressure, hydrate volume and composition are different according to crystallization rate. The hydrate volume and water conversion in the quick crystallization process were larger. Moreover, at a slow crystallization rate, in a hydrocarbon mixture, enclathration of propane is more considerable and the hydrate crystals appear to be more homogeneous. Furthermore, the hydrate crystallization of a gas mixture is closer to the thermodynamic equilibrium at slow crystallization rates where the impact of kinetics is slight. A new compilation of propane Kihara parameters was presented. Unlike methane, ethane and carbon dioxide, for propane we strongly recommend two Kihara parameters, one for pure and the other for mixtures of propane. A thermodynamic model based on classical van der Waals and Platteuw model was also used to investigate the effects of kinetics. The simulation results have a satisfactory accordance with the experimental data from literature to predict the hydrate equilibrium pressure. The consequence of this research could have a substantial impact on design calculations in which the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium are done. For instance, at present there would be excess hydrates volume estimations for pipe-lines, equilibrium conditions in energy storage and transportation or carbon capture sequestration and thus increase expenses or loss of productivity where propane is concerned.

AB In gas and liquid two-phase flow, different flow patterns show their unique nonlinear dynamic characteristics due to the complex interaction between them. To further reveal the underlying dynamic characteristics of this physical phenomenon, this paper presents a new model for the analysis of small channel gas-liquid two-phase flow pattern signals based on the multi-scale normalized Benford probability distribution (MSNBPD) analysis. The first focus area is the difference between the characteristics of a multi-scale approach to Benford's probability distribution and Benford's Law (BL) distribution in a typical nonlinear system. Once the terms are defined, the authors show how BL could be applied in a multi-scale based flow-pattern based method to analyze differential pressure signals of gas-liquid two-phase flow in small channels to reveal the underlying dynamic characteristics of different gas-liquid two-phase flow patterns, and their sensitivity to scale changes. In addition, the stability of different flow patterns was revealed by the variable scale range calculation. Flow patterns could then be distinguished based on Euclidean distance and the variable scale range difference of differential pressure signals. This paper also compares the present method with other methods that have been used in flow identification. The results show that this new method can well distinguish nonlinear systems with different dynamic mechanisms. This method can also reveal the underlying dynamic characteristics of a gas-liquid two-phase flow of micro and small channels. The two characteristic values (Euclidean distance and variable scale range difference) proved to be a good distinction for two-phase flow patterns than other time and frequency methods, with several possible universal applications. However, the identification results of micro and small channels were better than that of regular pipe, which shows that this method is more suitable for the identification of micro and small channel flow.

AB Present study deals with the effects of surfactants on the dynamics of bubble growth and detachment from a submerged orifice. Experiments are conducted to study the quasi-static growth of air bubble in de-ionized (DI) water mixed with nonionic surfactant Triton X-100. For comparison, bubble growth in pure DI water is also studied. While high-speed imaging is used for flow visualization, instantaneous velocity field, at different stages of bubble growth, are captured via particle image velocimetry. The study also uses bubble pressure Tensiometer technique and Goniometer for measuring the surface tensions. Present investigation shows that the bubble detachment volume decreases with the increase in the surfactant concentration. Further, for low concentration of surfactant, the surface tension gradient influences the flow field significantly and aid the bubble detachment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this communication, a nonlinear observer based control system is developed and illustrated by a reactive batch distillation column (RBDC) producing ethyl acetate. This ethyl acetate is the product of the esterification reaction between acetic acid and ethanol. Being the lightest component, ethyl acetate comes out first as distillate from the top of the column. With the aim to achieve a constant product purity, a nonlinear control scheme is developed, consisting of an extended generic model controller (EGMC) and an observer for the estimation of states required for controller simulation. Here two nonlinear state observers, namely neuro extended Kalman filter (NEKF) and neuro high gain observer (NHGO) are devised. Both the NHGO and NEKF are basically coupled with an artificial neural network (ANN) model, which aims to infer the product composition based on the measured tray temperature required for the closed-loop high gain observer (HGO) and nonlinear extended Kalman filter (EKF), respectively. Through open-loop simulation study, performance of these two state observers is evaluated. Although both the state observers are good enough to track the process output, the NEKF proves its superiority over the NHGO. In the subsequent closed-loop constant composition control investigation, a comparison is made between the EGMC-NHGO and EGMC-NEKF with respect to a traditional proportional integral (PI) controller. In this closed-loop comparative study, it is observed that the performance of the EGMC-NEKF is better than the EGMC-NHGO and the conventional PI. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A diffusion-limited shrinking spherical particle model was developed to describe cellulose dissolution in carbon dioxide switchable system (CO2-SWS) by assuming an instantaneous reaction of the CO2-SWS on the cellulose surface. CO2, the main precursor of the SWS, was mixed with 1,8-diazabicyclo [5.4.0] undec7-ene, ethylene glycol and dimethyl sulfoxide under various operating pressures (P) and temperatures (T) to yield a CO2 switchable ionic liquid for cellulose dissolution. As dissolution proceeded, the cellulose particle radius decreased because of the disappearance of cellulose. The model-predicted diffusion coefficient (D), completed dissolution time (tau), and dissolution conversion (X-C) were determined under various CO2-SWS operating conditions. The predicted tau and X-C values were in good agreement with the observed results. The influence of the CO2-SWS operating conditions on the predicted numerical D, tau, and X-C values were investigated using Spearman's rho correlation. The results showed that the D values ranged from 10 (20) to 10 (17) m(2) s (1) for the CO2-SWS-cellulose system depending on the system conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Standard wound healing assays often deal with just one initial wound shape, and it is unclear whether varying the initial wound shape might impact how we interpret results from these experiments. Here, we use a new kind of wound healing assay, called a sticker assay, to explore the role of initial wound shape. We examine wound healing with square, circular and triangular wounds. Measurements of wound area as a function of time show that the rate of wound closure depends on the initial wound shape. This is interesting because the only aspect of the assay we change is the initial wound shape, and the reason for different closure rates is unclear. To provide more insight we calibrate a typical mathematical model to match the data. This shows that the rates of cell motility and proliferation associated with different initial wound shapes are approximately the same, implying that the differences in the closure rates are consistent with a typical mathematical model of wound healing. Therefore, parameter estimates from an experiment with a particular wound shape can be used to predict an experiment with a different initial wound shape. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In process and materials chemistry, computational modelling of complex reactive systems has been a long-time continuing process. The methodology based on numerical methods in mechanistic reaction kinetics as well as for fluid phase thermodynamics applying equations of state is well established. During the last two decades, however, thermodynamic multiphase technology based on the minimisation of Gibbs free energy has made progress in modelling both reactive flows and processing of functional materials. Recent advancements also include introduction of such new Gibbs'ian algorithms, which facilitate calculation of time-dependent changes in reactive multi-component multi-phase systems. Comparison between detailed kinetic mechanisms (DKMs) and multiphase thermochemical techniques has yet seldom been available. The present work describes a unique comparison between constrained Gibbs free energy calculation (with one constrained kinetic reaction rate) and detailed kinetic mechanism of 67 reversible reactions between 28 species, as performed for the industrially interesting Titanium(IV) chloride oxidation process. When confined to gas phase kinetics, the calculated results show fair agreement between the two different techniques. However, comparison with observations from an experimental plug flow reactor suggests that the formation of a solid Ti-oxide phase in the models becomes a necessity. The applicability of the alternative simulation techniques in chemical reactor engineering is shortly discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mechanism modeling is an important method to quantify the flow heterogeneous phenomena of gas-liquid- solid fluidization. In this study, an improved meso-scale flow model, based on the energy minimum multi-scale ( EMMS) theory, is developed to predict the global flow parameters of gas-liquid-solid fluidized bed. The improved EMMS model introduces gas bubble and solid particle accelerations, which make the model be capable of accurately predicting both the nominal-steady and the unsteady hydrodynamics of gas-liquid-solid fluidization. Compared with the reported models, the predicted results of this improved EMMS model are closer to the experiment data. Furthermore, the predictions indicate that both gas bubble acceleration and solid particle acceleration have an influence on the flow behavior of gasliquid- solid fluidized bed, such as gas bubble diameter and relative slip velocity, which seriously affect the momentum and mass transfer between phases. Meanwhile, the accelerations of gas bubble and solid particle are not always equal to 0 at the nominal-steady state. Furthermore, the acceleration behavior of the unsteady-state gives a reasonable explanation for gas bubble coalescence. However, the relative error between model predictions and experimental data increases with the superficial gas velocity and the solid particle inertia. Thus this improved EMMS model is suitable for flow system at low superficial gas velocity with light and small solid particles. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, the hydrodynamics of a bubble column with vertical heat exchanger internals in a narrow bubble column of D-i = 0: 1 m inner diameter with a clear liquid height of L-c = 1: 1 m was comprehensively studied. We applied ultrafast X-ray tomography to obtain hydrodynamic parameters, such as gas holdup, bubble size distribution, bubble number flux and flow patterns at hitherto inaccessible positions within the sub-channels of the tube bundles. To investigate the influence of the tube bundle pattern, square and triangular pitches were considered. Tubes of d(o) = 8 and 13 mm outer diameter were installed to study the effect of tube size, while maintaining approx. A(c) = 25% coverage of the cross-sectional area, which is typical for, e.g., Fischer-Tropsch processes operated in bubble column reactors. The superficial gas velocity was varied from u(g) = 2 to 20 cms (1) to cover homogeneous and heterogeneous flow regimes. Internals' type and tube diameter were found to crucially influence the gas holdup distribution across the column diameter, which is known to generate liquid circulation, to shape the gas velocity profile and to cause intensive bubble interactions. The higher flow resistance induced by triangular tube configurations and dense tube patterns, which is attributed to the smaller hydraulic diameter of the respective configurations, forces bubbles to preferably rise near the column wall. Within the tube bundle, the radial holdup profiles show a pronounced non-parabolic trend, indicating zones of reverse liquid flow directions between the internal tubes. Furthermore, the gas-liquid flow morphology within various sub-channels was analyzed revealing a slug-like flow formation at superficial gas velocities larger than 10 cm s (1). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this work, the proper charge density of a microfiltration membrane has been determined by using two different methods. Firstly, the ionic transport of a KCl solution has been investigated by simultaneous measurements of saline flux and membrane potential (MP) resulting from a concentration gradient through the membrane. A simple model, including all the relevant contributions to the global electrical potential drop, allowed a calculation of transport numbers and membrane charge density.
   The response of ions inside the membrane to an oscillating electrical potential has been analyzed by impedance spectroscopy (or electrical impedance spectroscopy EIS). A quite simple experimental EIS design allowed, by taking into account MP measurements too, an easy assignation of an equivalent circuit. After a careful analysis of EIS results, it was possible to evaluate the electrical conductivity inside the pores and the charge density. Both were found to be quite similar to the values obtained from MP alone. This agreement of EIS results with the MP ones, that are much simpler to deal with, confirms the accuracy of EIS to study the electrical properties of microfiltration membranes.
   The influence of electrode roughness and, in our EIS cell, the membrane roughness, on the constant phase element (CPE) of the equivalent circuit has been proved. Within this frame, the roughness fractal dimension of the membrane surface could be determined from EIS measurements. It resulted in fair agreement with the atomic force microscopy (AFM) determination. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work presents a multi-scale approach to reacting and expanding polyurethane (PU) foams modeling and simulation. The modeling strategy relies on two pillars: an atomistic model (molecular dynamics (MD)/Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC)) that provides liquid mixture density and reactant solubility and a continuum model (CFD) in which the expansion characteristics of the foam is modeled exploiting the results of the atomistic simulations. The resulting coupled model is validated for two different PU systems applied in four batches with chemical and physical blowing agents. The results demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of the developed model in the simulation of different PU foam properties such as apparent density and temperature evolutions.

AB Cellulose and cellulose acetate membranes were fabricated by phase inversion from their solutions in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM] OAc), or its mixture with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Inclusion of DMSO in the solution decreased crystallinity and rejection for both polymers. When cellulose solutions were coagulated in ethanol crystallinity and rejections were lower, and cellulose acetate membranes coagulated in ethanol had a loose, macroporous morphology, which was attributed to the poor nonsolvent strength of ethanol for this polymer. All cellulose membranes, when dried, performed similarly in rejecting Blue Dextran (20 kDa) by over 90% and Bromothymol Blue by around 80%. On the other hand, when these membranes were used without drying, Bromothymol Blue rejections decreased with increasing DMSO content in solution and with changing of nonsolvent from water to ethanol, implying the presence of a microporous structure which collapses to a similar dense structure upon drying for all cases. Phase inversion rate of both polymers was slower in ethanol, which was attributed to the lower diffusivity of ethanol compared to water due to its larger size. The viscosity of the solvent media, which differed by an order of magnitude between [EMIM]OAc and [EMIM]OAc-DMSO mixtures, on the other hand, did not have a measurable influence on the phase inversion rate.

DT Article

ID FAULT-DETECTION; MIXTURE MODEL; ALIGNMENT
AB In general, batch processes cover two-directional dynamics, in which the batch-wise dynamics are related to different operation modes, while the time-wise variations correspond to different phases within each batch. The problem of unevenness is common as a result of various factors, particularly in multimode batch processes. In order to address these issues, this paper proposes a two-directional concurrent strategy of mode identification and sequential phase division for multimode and multiphase batch process monitoring with the uneven problem. Firstly, pseudo time-slices are constructed in order to describe the process characteristics regarding the sample concerned, which can preserve the local neighborhood information within a constrained searching range and effectively prevent the synchronizing problem caused by uneven lengths. Secondly, mode identification is conducted along the batch direction and the phase affiliation is sequentially determined along time direction by determining the changes in variable correlations. The two-directional steps are implemented alternatively in order to identify the mode and phase information, which can also guarantee the time sequence within each mode. Thirdly, for online monitoring, the mode information and phase affiliation are simultaneously judged in real time for each new sample, from which the fault status is distinguished from the phase shift. The division results can indicate the critical-to-mode phases from which a certain mode begins to be separated into different sub-modes. In order to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, it is applied to a multimode and multiphase batch process (namely an injection molding process) with the uneven problem.

AB Plasma electrochemistry is an emerging technique for nanomaterial synthesis. The present study reports the preparation of yttrium oxide nanoparticles via a simple, environmentally benign, microplasma-assisted process operated in pin-to-liquid configuration under ambient atmospheric conditions using yttrium nitrate aqueous solution as the precursor. The plasma-liquid interaction was monitored in-situ by optical emission spectroscopy. The morphology, structure and chemical composition of the obtained products were examined by complementary analytical methods. It was demonstrated that high purity crystalline Y2O3 nanoparticles with adjustable sizes can be fabricated via a two-step method: plasma electrodeposition of yttrium hydroxide followed by heat-treatment at various temperatures. A micro-plasma array design was proposed for the process upscaling towards industrial level production. Moreover, possible mechanisms for plasma-assisted yttrium hydroxide precipitation were discussed by correlating optical emission spectroscopic studies, plasma kinetic analysis and the precipitation equilibrium. As a proof-of-concept, this process offers a facile, environmental friendly and scalable route for rare-earth oxide nanomaterial synthesis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The precipitation process of L-glutamic acid from monosodium glutamate solution through acidification is studied by using hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid. Both experimental and modelling methods are applied. The experiments have been carried out with a single feed semi-batch process applying two acid feed rates and two rotational mixing speeds. The method for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling of the semi-batch process with a changing fluid volume is presented. The precipitation process including nucleation and crystal growth is modelled with CFD by using the kinetics presented in the literature for hydrochloric acid. A model for agglomeration presented in the literature and Eddy Dissipation Concept for micromixing are applied in the case of a lower rotational speed and hydrochloric acid. The particle size distribution is modelled with the simple number density model and with Quadrature Method of Moments. Micromixing was found to have an insignificant effect, but when including the model for agglomeration, the particle size distribution was in better agreement with the experiments. However, pH evolution of the system was captured better without the agglomeration model, indicating that the kinetic model may not describe the precipitation accurately. The pH and saturation ratio Sa were modelled based on thermodynamics. The significance of activities is highlighted in computing the thermodynamic equilibrium, and in precipitation kinetics. It was found that the applied acid had an effect on the chemical process, although the species concentrations were the same. The difference of the kinetic models between hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid could be explained by the more complex dissociation of sulphuric acid. The greater computational ionic strength with sulphuric acid increased the nucleation rate, resulting in a difference in pH evolution in comparison with hydrochloric acid. Therefore, the kinetic parameters determined for the hydrochloric acid system are not applicable for other acid systems with different chemical compositions. For the modelling of the precipitating systems, more experimental work is needed for determining the kinetics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Here we present the microfluidic approach to engineer polymeric Janus particles using solvent dissolution for potential drug delivery applications. Unlike the polymerization based particle generation techniques, this method does not suffer from potential toxicity concerns for drug delivery. This technique is based on dissolving away the solvent in the solution droplets containing designed concentration distribution of drug and polymer while preserving the concentration distribution during the transition of the droplet into a particle. We investigated the kinetics of solidification and concentration evolution in the droplets under different operational conditions. Our investigation demonstrated that the designed biphasic concentration of a drug surrogate introduced into two hemispheres of the droplets can be preserved in solidified particles. We conclude with practical guidelines for generating polymeric Janus particles using the dissolution technique. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, heavy crude oil and formation brine collected from Xinjiang oilfield were used to prepare crude oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions. Emulsification tests were first conducted to screen suitable emulsifiers. Then stability test, droplet size distribution analysis, and rheological property measurements were carried out to investigate the physicochemical characteristics of the developed O/W emulsions. It was found that surfactants of Span 60 and Tween 80 combined with sodium hydroxide could reduce the oil/water interfacial tension and thereby emulsify the heavy crude oil in formation brine. A series of sandpack flow tests were conducted to evaluate the plugging performance of the heavy O/W emulsions, emulsified using 0.1 wt% Span 60-0.1 wt% Tween 80-0.025 wt% NaOH. The flow test results showed that heavy O/W emulsion can result in more than 99% permeability reductions in sandpacks. The permeability reduction by emulsion plugging increased greatly with an increase in oil quality and injected emulsion slug, but decreased with an increase in sandpack permeability and injection flow rate.

AB Unmixed Combustion (UMC), a novel variant of combustion, occurs when air and fuel alternately pass over an Oxygen Storage and Release Material (OSRM), usually metal/metal oxides, that undergoes oxidation and reduction reactions. The energy released during these reactions can potentially be utilized for various heat transfer applications. In this regard, a dynamic 2-D pseudo-homogeneous model has been developed for an UMC based annular packed bed reactor incorporating the phenomena of heat transfer across a surface to a representative coolant, i.e. air. A CFD software COMSOL Multiphysics (TM) was used for model implementation and simulation. Cu/CuO on alumina was chosen as a representative OSRM, while zero air and methane (diluted with nitrogen) were used as reactive gases in the simulations. For prescribed operating conditions, the model predicts temperature profiles in the bed and total heat transfer. Model results for one cycle comprising of oxidation and reduction at 1.25 kg of OSRM loading and an operating temperature range of 823.15-973.15 K, were compared with those obtained from experimental data. Good agreement to within +/- 2% for radial heat transfer to coolant and +/- 9% for bed temperature profiles was found. The effect of varying reactive gas and coolant flowrate on the radial heat transfer was also simulated. This sensitivity analysis helped identify the limits of operating variables for optimal performance and confirm theoretical viability of operation. The results validate the use of a pseudo-homogeneous model in predicting the behaviour of dynamically operated UMC systems under the operating conditions in which the present study was carried out.

AB This work describes a CFD modeling study of the Water Gas Shift single stage process in adiabatic conditions, operated by COMSOL Multiphysics 5.0, by means of two different catalytic configurations; the real novelty was to show that the use of structured catalysts with high thermal conductivity could greatly improve the performances of the whole process. The simulations are then validated with kinetic data reported in a previous work, and provides a useful springboard for the design of a single stage process. It was demonstrated that the use of highly conductive carriers reduces the difference of temperature throughout the catalytic bed, under adiabatic conditions, by means of a backdiffusion of the heat of reaction from the output to the input of the bed. The redistribution allows to increase the inlet temperature, with a benefit for the kinetics, at the expence of the outlet temperature that, decreasing, promotes the thermodynamics. The use of a highly active catalytic formulation, at low temperatures, coupled with a conductive carrier, provides, in principle, the possibility to realize a strong intensification of the process.

AB This paper reports on the development and evaluation of an SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) model for high pressure water flow through and from a nozzle and prediction of its break up into a spray of high speed water droplets. This appears to be the first application of the SPH technique to fully model a high pressure nozzle. The model predicts the internal flow and pressure distribution and enables exploration of the role of the internal geometric insert used in this design of the nozzle. It also predicts exit velocities from the nozzle as well as the pressure distribution generated by the nozzle and droplet size distribution of the resulting spray. Three different nozzle inflow rates were simulated and for all cases the numerical simulation of nozzle and spray gave generally good agreement with experiments, but complete agreement was not achieved. For better agreement, higher resolution for the SPH solution is required. The SPH simulations also show the role that the insert in the nozzle has on the flow and the resulting jet. It produces a flat inclined high velocity liquid jet within the second half of the nozzle which will generate turbulent eddies that may enhance the nucleation of the droplets in the fragmenting jet after it exits the nozzle. Overall, SPH has been shown to have a very good capacity to model high pressure nozzles and with further refinements of the technique should be able to yield accurate, quantitative data.

AB The design of an efficient and scale-up ready reactor system is, together with development of a high performance oxygen carrier, one of the most important research topics in chemical looping combustion. The dual circulating fluidized bed (DCFB) concept is a reactor concept consisting of two interconnected circulating fluidized beds, air and fuel reactor, where the oxygen carrier is the bed material. In the present study a so-called cold flow model is used to investigate the fluid dynamic behavior of a next scale design based on the DCFB concept (10 MW fuel power input) in order to optimize the system design.
   Four different designs of the fuel reactor are investigated with focus on the solid distribution and general operating parameters and their influence on the operating range. For that purpose, several parameters like e.g. the amount of fluidization gas for both reactors, the total solid inventory, and the fuel power, are variated. Pressure profiles are used to get a comprehensive overview of the fluid dynamic behavior of the different reactor designs.
   Comparison of the fuel reactor designs shows that operation of the air reactor is not affected by changes of the fuel reactor design. In contrast significant changes, especially in the solid distribution, are recognizable for the different fuel reactor designs. These changes concern mainly the adapted sections of the fuel reactor.
   Two of the proposed fuel reactor designs are limited in their operating range due to unstable operating conditions, caused by fluid dynamic effects. At such unstable operating conditions the solid inventory distribution between both reactors fluctuates. This behavior is caused by the geometry of the fuel reactor. Further, due to variations in the geometry of the fuel reactor effects leading to the unstable operating conditions are identified. However, unstable operating conditions are caused by the shape of the conical form of the bottom part of the fuel reactor. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID VOLUME; MODEL
AB This work reports on the development and application of a new approach, corrective interface tracking, to simulate finite size bubbles. Finite-size bubbles, which are by definition bigger than the grid cell size but not well resolved, are not capable of being modeled with any standard two-phase flow approaches, such as interface tracking (IT), Euler-Euler (EE), or Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT). This poses a problem when simulating bubbly flows with different bubble sizes on the same computational grid. The Finite-size Lagrangian particle tracking (FSL) approach (Badreddine et al., 2015), aimed at simulating finite-size bubbly flows by inheriting features of IT and LPT approaches, simulated a single bubble with good accuracy. However, deficiencies with the FSL approach led to a newly developed approach based on interface tracking with the addition of a correcting force. The correcting force, derived from modeling the hydrodynamic forces on a bubble, attempts to correct for errors introduced when a coarse grid is used and the flow and pressure fields around the bubble are under-resolved. Therefore, as a finer grid is used the correcting force decreases. The corrective interface tracking approach is validated against a single bubble rising in stagnant and linear flow, and then results are compared to FSL and to finely resolved IT simulations.

AB A 1D model based on Darcy's law is proposed to allow quantitative measurements of the penetration depth of water-glycerol-hexanediol mixtures in thin porous media using an Automatic Scanning Absorptometer (ASA). The limitations of this 1D model are discussed with respect to the nozzle dimensions and the liquid penetration depth. The penetration depth scales with liquid (viscosity and surface tension (eta, sigma)) and media parameters (average pore radius (r)) as predicted by Darcy's law for Al2O3 disks that are inert to the liquid components. The penetration dynamics in PVDF and MCE filter membranes show a deviation from Darcy's law, indicating specific liquid - media interaction with at least one of the liquid components. Furthermore a linear time regime is observed in the early stages of liquid penetration for time scales much larger than for which inertia effects are expected. This can on the one hand indicate that either, the liquid does not move into the fibrous samples as a homogenous liquid, or that the porous material deforms during the liquid imbibition process. On the other hand, it could be an effect resulting from the complexity of the porous structure itself and an indication of surface film flow formation. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB Interfacially synthesized polyamide (PA) thin-film composite (TFC) membranes are widely employed in forward osmosis (FO) applications because of the easy fabrication and excellent separation performance. But they generally suffer from the relative low water permeability and high fouling tendency due to the inherent hydrophobic nature of the PA layer. In this study, an efficient surface modification of nascent TFC membranes is performed by grafting a self-catalyzed tripodal amine-tris(2-aminoethyl) amine (TAEA), in order to improve the membrane performance. This tertiary amine plays a dual role of the reactive amine monomer reacting with acyl chloride groups and the catalyst accelerating the amidation reaction between 1,3,5-trimesoyl chloride (TMC) and TAEA, therefore contributing to an efficient grafting effect to the greatest extent. State-of-the-art characterizations are applied to verify the modification mechanism. The effects of the pH and concentration of the TAEA solution on the overall properties of the resultant TFC membranes are systematically investigated, including the surface chemical composition, surface morphology, hydrophilicity, surface charge, separation performance, and fouling resistance. Compared with the control TFC membrane, TAE-modified TFC membranes exhibit significantly improved water fluxes, higher antifouling propensity, and comparable reverse salt fluxes.

AB We present a new method for the synthesis of mass exchanger networks (MENs) involving packed columns. Simultaneous synthesis of MENs is typically done through the use of mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) optimization, with simplifications made in the mathematical representations of the exchangers due to computational difficulty in solving large non-convex mixed-integer problems. The methodology proposed in this study makes use of the stage-wise based superstructure MINLP formulation for the network synthesis. This stage-wise superstructure model incorporates fixed mass transfer coefficients, fixed column diameters, no pressure drops, and unequal compositional mixing for models. In this paper, the simplified MINLP model is further improved by including a detailed individual packed column design in a non-linear programming (NLP) sub-optimization step, where orthogonal collocation is utilized for the partial differential equations, and optimal packing size, column diameter, column height, pressure drops, and fluid velocities. Detailed designs are then used to determine correction factors that update the simplified stage-wise superstructure models to more accurately portray the chosen design. Once the MINLP is updated with these correction factors, the model is re-run, with new correction factors obtained. This iterative procedure is repeated until convergence between the objective function of the MINLP and that of the NLP sub-optimization is achieved, or until a maximum number of iterations is reached. The methodology is applied to two examples and is shown to be robust and effective in generating new topologies, and in finding superior networks that are physically realizable.

AB The eXtended Discrete Element Method (XDEM) platform which is a Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian framework with heat and mass transfer, is extended for melting of granular packed beds. In this method, the fluid is simulated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and the soft-sphere discrete element approach (DEM) is used for the particle system. A four-way coupling accounts for solid-liquid interaction via drag and buoyancy forces and the collisions between the particles and the walls. The contact forces between the particles and wall-particle contacts have been calculated by the hertz-mindlin model. The particles heat up, melt and shrink due to heat and mass exchange, and the temperature distributions inside the particles are described. In order to validate the method, melting of a single ice particle and of a packed bed of ice in flowing water have been carried out. Very good agreement between the simulation and experiment has been achieved. The effects of the temperature and velocity of flowing water on melting rate are also discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Polymer blends with oriented ribbon-like dispersed phase were prepared via tape extrusion. Two specially designed compatibilizers, one being non-reactive and another reactive, were used to examine their influence on the formation of oriented ribbon-like dispersed phase in polystyrene (PS)/polyamide 6 (PA6) blend. Results show that both compatibilizers can decrease interfacial tension and produce vinculum effect to strengthen the deformation of dispersed phase. Moreover, the stretching force of tape extrusion pushes the compatibilizer molecules towards the tips of dispersed phase causing a non-uniform distribution along the surface of dispersed phase. At a low loading concentration of compatibilizer, the deformed dispersed phase particles can connect each other from their middle part and merge into long and even endless ribbons. However, when the loading of compatibilizer exceeds a certain level, the formation of ribbon-like dispersed phase will be impeded because all surfaces of dispersed phase are completely covered by the compatibilizer so that the coalescence of dispersed phase cannot occur.

   Kinetic coefficients determination; Intersections
ID CHLORINATED ACETYLENE REACTION; COINCIDENCES; PATHWAYS; ETHYLENE
AB In solving the kinetic model reduction problem for CSTR studies, a new procedure of decomposing the full mechanism was developed. In this procedure, the full mechanism was decomposed in two submechanisms, Kinetic Informative Detachable (KID) mechanism and Feeding Mechanism (FEM) linked by a special bridging reaction via a single gateway substance which belongs to FEM. Requirements for such decomposition were formulated. This procedure allows to produce relationships which depend only on the kinetic coefficients of the KID mechanism and the gateway substance reaction. In a typical case, say for the mechanism A ->(k1) B reversible arrow(k2+)(k2-) C, the reciprocal space time value tau at the intersection of the B and C kinetic dependences is characterized by a simple relation 1/tau - k(2)(+) - k(2)(-). In general, this or similar dependences can be used for extracting the kinetic coefficients.
   Mathematically, the procedure is grounded on a generalized eigenvalue problem.
   Decomposition of a given mechanism into sub-mechanisms can be done in multiple ways with different corresponding gateways, and, consequently, different kinetic coefficients can be extracted. Theoretical concepts are illustrated by many examples of mechanisms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Li-LSX (low silica type-X) zeolite is the sorbent of choice for air separation by adsorption today. Li-LSX is obtained by ion exchange of Na-LSX. The occupancy of Site III (SIII, which is the open site in the supercage) by Li+ is crucially important for N-2 adsorption. In this work, mixed-cation LiNa-LSX zeolites were prepared and N-2 adsorption isotherms were measured. The isosteric heats of adsorption of N-2 were obtained from the temperature dependence. The heats of adsorption remained at approximately 17.7 kJ/mol (i.e., that for pure Na-LSX) at Li+ exchange below approximately 70%, and increased upon further increase in Li+ exchange, to 22.6 kJ/mol (i.e., that for pure Li-LSX). The increase was not linear (i.e., concave shaped), however, which indicated that one N2 molecule could likely adsorb on two adjacent cation sites. The relationship between heat of adsorption and Li ion occupancy on site SIII was obtained. It is suggested that this relationship may be used to estimate the occupancy by Li+ on SIII of faujasite type of zeolites. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The population balance approach (PBM) is generally used in the literature to simulate a milling process. The formulation of a breakage kernel to represent particle breakage phenomenon is an important part of the model. This study proposes a methodology to estimate parameters of a breakage kernel that captures material property dependent particle level dynamics through discrete element method (DEM) simulations of a comill process. The DEM model takes into account a threshold impact energy that if exceeded, results in granule breakage. The impact energy distribution data for various size classes and impellor speeds is obtained from DEM. Comill experiments at various impeller speeds result in different observed size distributions and other process variables such as hold up amount, and time required for process to reach steady state. An iterative algorithm is proposed that uses mechanistic information from DEM and process variables from experiments to calibrate the breakage kernel through which material specific kernel parameters are estimated. A multi-scale modeling framework utilizing DEM, PBM as well as experimental data is developed. The framework is implemented to estimate material specific properties using milling experimental data at various impeller speeds. The milled particle size distribution predicted from the model with parameters estimated using this framework, demonstrated excellent agreement with experimental results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pipe blockage due to gas hydrate formation is a main concern in the oil and gas industry due to the revenue losses caused by either production impairments or interruptions, and to the high costs associated to the elimination of such blockages. Assuming a hydrate formation rate in the gas-water interface based on the system subcooling, the present work models the transition from two-phase liquid-gas to three-phase solid-liquid-gas flows when hydrates form. The multiphase flow is assumed to be within the slug flow pattern region, as this is the prevailing flow regime in offshore production scenarios. The model couples mass, momentum and energy balances for the slug flow unit cell. The hydrate phase is assumed as homogeneously dispersed in the water. The gas and water consumption rates due to hydrate formation are modeled as source terms in the mass balance equations. The exothermic characteristic of the hydrate formation is taken into account in the energy conservation equation. The model provides analytic expressions for temperature and pressure distributions along the pipeline. However, the unit cell geometry is solved by numerical integration and the model closure is achieved only when empirical correlations for the slug frequency, the unit cell translational velocity and the slug aeration are used. The results from the numerical simulations are presented for the same input parameters for cases with and without hydrate formation. The discussion focuses on the influence of hydrate formation in the slug flow hydrodynamics and heat transfer. The main mechanisms affecting the mixture temperature and pressure distributions, the mixture heat transfer coefficient, the superficial velocities of the phases, the liquid loading, the slug flow frequency and the unit cell geometry are presented.

We analyze the whole microfluidic system using electrical circuit analogies, and demonstrate that off-chip compliances are significant, especially for displacement pump driven systems. We apply this hydrodynamic damping method to microfluidic droplet generation. Our results show that highly monodisperse microdroplets can be obtained by syringe pump driven systems utilizing this damping effect. We reached a coefficient of variation of 0.39% for the microdroplet area using a standard T-junction geometry. Additionally, we demonstrated that pressure pumps inherently use this effect, and have so far led the high performances reported in the literature in terms of droplet monodispersity. The presented off-chip hydrodynamic damping method is not only low-cost and practical, but can also be used in elastomeric and rigid microchannels without need to introduce additional components to the fluidic circuit.

AB Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) has been considered as a promising technical route to upgrade fast pyrolysis oil to liquid transportation fuels. In this work, a series of active and inexpensive catalysts were synthesized for bio-oil HDO, i.e., activated carbon (AC)-supported nickel phosphide and cobalt phosphide catalysts, with a metal/P molar ratio varying from 5/2, 3/2, 1/1, 1/2, 1/3. For comparison, AC-support pure metal catalysts without P were also prepared. Effects of phosphorus content on HDO performance of the catalysts were investigated on a 100 mL bench-scale reactor system using a wood-derived pyrolysis oil at 300 degrees C and initial hydrogen pressure of 50 bar for 3 h. The results showed that the properties of the upgraded bio-oils were greatly affected by the phosphorus content in both Ni and Co catalysts. The best performance seemed to be achieved with the catalysts at a metal/P molar ratio of about 3/2. Moreover, 0.5 wt% of Ru was further added to the catalysts at a metal/P molar ratio of 3/2 and to the pure metal catalysts. The addition of a small amount of Ru was found to markedly decrease the relative molecular weight of the upgraded bio-oils, and achieved high quality bio-oil products similar to that obtained with an expensive commercially available 5 wt% Ru/C catalyst.

AB This study reports an experiment to investigate the wetted wall fraction (WWF), which represents the shape of the continuous interface of the air-water stratified and wavy flow regimes, in horizontal and inclined pipes with an inner diameter of 40 mm. Using the experimental data, a semi-empirical model to predict the WWF was developed based on the energy balance for the liquid phase in separated flows. The model used a relationship between the WWF and the center of gravity of the liquid phase with a concave interface that can describe continuous changes to the flow regime from a stratified to an annular. The coefficients of the model were empirically determined based on a wide range of experimental data from the literature obtained in the air and various liquids covering a void fraction of greater than 0.79, a pipe with inner diameter in the range 24-150 mm, density differences varying from 812 to 1052 kg/m(3), a range of liquid phase viscosity of 0.87-5.66 mPa s, surface tension ranging from 27.9 to 72.7 mN/m, a wide range of inclination angles from -27 degrees for a downward flow to +3 degrees for a upward flow, and gas and liquid Reynolds numbers based on a superficial velocity of up to 219,000 and 7500, respectively. This WWF model was tested using an extensive experimental database of the WWF and void fraction in the stratified and wavy flow regimes, and yielded the best agreement compared with existing models in the literature.

AB In this study, sulfonated pitch (SP), composed of hydrophilic sulfonate groups and hydrophobic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, was incorporated into sodium alginate (SA) membranes for ethanol dehydration via pervaporation. The morphologies and structures of the SP and hybrid membranes were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) and water contact angle measurement. Hydrophilic sulfonate groups in SP formed hydrophilic regions which can bind water molecules, ensuring sufficient water occupancy in the membranes, while the hydrophobic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons provided continuous transport "highways" for the water molecules. Meanwhile, the introduction of SP created more polymer-filler interface cavities, rendering the membrane with suitable free volume property for separation. Consequently, the membrane demonstrated a maximum permeation flux of 1879 +/- 80 g/m(2) h coupled with an optimal separation factor of 1913 +/- 69 in separating 90 wt% ethanol aqueous solution. These resulted in an increase over the SA control membrane of 1.5-fold and 4-fold respectively. Moreover, the hybrid membranes exhibited good operation stability. The results suggested that incorporating fillers with hydrophilic-hydrophobic regions in the membranes can be an effective strategy to improve the performance of water-permselective membranes.

AB We introduce novel insights into a cross-flow arrangement of structured packings specifically for post-combustion carbon dioxide capture. Gas-liquid dynamics are investigated numerically, with the liquid flowing under the action of the gravity and the gas driven by a horizontal pressure gradient crossing the liquid phase. An elementary packing cell consists of two connected channels: one depicting a cocurrent gas-liquid flow and the other depicting a counter-current two-phase flow. While flow reversal of the liquid phase can occur in the counter-flow channel at high gas flow rates, the overall flooding point is significantly delayed in comparison to a counter-current flow arrangement traditionally used for structured packings. Varying the gas flow rate and the tilting angle of the elementary cell, a detailed numerical analysis of the flow repartition between channels, the pressure drop, the gas and liquid velocities, and the onset of flooding is presented. The pressure drop is found to be smaller when tilting the cell with respect to the initial scenario at 45 degrees. Flow reversal instead is delayed when lowering the tilting angle, that is when the cell is tilted anti-clockwise. We also reveal the presence of long waves at the edge of the cell at low tilting angles. Finally, data of the wet pressure drop in the cross-flow cell are compared with different commercially available types of packing arranged in a conventional vertical counter-flow configuration, such as several versions of the Sulzer MellapakTM.

AB The hydrodynamics of gaseous and supercritical CO2-ethanol flows in microchannels under elevated pressure (45-90 bar) at 40 degrees C have been visualized experimentally. The effect of pressure and CO2-ethanol mixture composition on the flow regimes developed has been investigated and related to the thermodynamic phase equilibrium diagram. The characteristics of gas-liquid Taylor flow formed at elevated pressure have been analyzed and compared with Taylor flows at ambient conditions. The results of this study show that depending on the pressure and mixture composition, different flow regimes are formed, namely two-phase Taylor flow, dissolving Taylor flow, single-phase jetting-dissolving flow and single-phase supercritical jetting flow. The formation of these flows is explained with respect to the phase equilibrium diagram of CO2-ethanol. In the two-phase flow region, Taylor bubble size has been shown to depend on both CO2-ethanol mixture composition and operating pressure due to changes in CO2 mass flow rate and density, respectively. The bubble size formed has shown to increase linearly with U-G/U-L closely following the well-known bubble formation models for ambient conditions. Due to the non-negligible solubility of CO2 in ethanol, the Taylor bubble size decreases in the channel until equilibrium is reached. Mass transfer is not easily quantified however due to the mutually soluble nature of CO2 and ethanol and the dependency of this solubility on pressure. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of NO and O-2 concentration (as well as temperature) on NOX storage on a Lean NOX Trap (LNT) has been investigated using NOX breakthrough curves measured with a laboratory reactor. Data were measured over a wide range of temperatures (125-450 degrees C) and NO and O-2 concentrations. The break-through curves were run until the LNT was saturated to (i) enable NO oxidation to NO2 to be studied in the absence of NOX storage, (ii) to enable the effective NOX storage capacity as a function of temperature and concentration to be determined, and (iii) to provide a more demanding test for potential models.
   Under the range of conditions investigated, the amount of NOX stored at saturation was found to increase with NOX concentration, but to only be slightly influenced by O-2 concentration. The rate of NOX storage was found to increase with NOX and O-2 concentration.
   The data has been modelled and the performance of a number of kinetic models for NOX storage compared. It is shown that models which give comparable predictions over a narrow range of conditions can give different predictions when a wider range of conditions is considered; this demonstrates the importance of testing models over a wide range of conditions. Two types of storage sites were required to model the data: "Fast" sites are responsible for the initial part of the breakthrough curve, which is independent of temperature; both the rate of storage on these sites and the available capacity is independent of temperature. The rate of storage on "slow" sites, on the other hand, is temperature dependant, as is the available storage capacity. Slow sites are more abundant than fast sites. The rate of storage and the available capacity of both types of site are concentration dependent. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Continuous enzymatic catalyzed reactive distillation (eRD) is a new process that can reduce product inhibition and the need for additional purification steps. However, the enzymatic catalyst is exposed to markedly different conditions than in conventional processes. The enzyme stability, a crucial cost factor, has not been investigated for the application in an eRD and the underlying mechanisms for catalyst deactivation are still unknown. This article presents for the first time a comprehensive study on the scale and causes of enzyme activity reduction in eRD processes. Pilot plant experiments with the transesterification of butyl acetate with hexanol catalyzed by Novozyme 435 confirm the existence of a process window with high reaction rates and low activity loss. The remaining activity after 320 h of operation is investigated in each reactive packing, leading to a new found cause of activity reduction that has so far not been considered for enzymatic catalyzed reactive distillation. The results allow for a better design and operation of eRD processes and the development of enzyme immobilisates that cater to the specific needs of integrated operation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The present work is a comparative analysis of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) computed on experimental turbulent velocity fields measured in a 20L-tank stirred by two Rushton impellers at two rotating speeds, N = 150 and 300 rpm. POD identifies flow structures that optimally capture the total kinetic energy of the flow, while DMD identifies structures that significantly contribute to the dynamics of the flow. The experimental data, i.e. the instantaneous velocity fields U-r(r, z, t) and U-z(r, z, t), come from 2-D Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The flow motion is turbulent, and it occurs over a wide range of length and time scales, from equipment-dependent large-scale coherent structures to the smallest-scale eddies where energy dissipation takes place. It thus provides an interesting benchmark case for the comparison between POD and DMD, which are based on energy and dynamic analysis, respectively. POD analysis reveals that the most energetic structures are related to the inherent periodic unsteadiness due to the relative motion between the rotating impeller blades and the non-moving baffles. Apart from the mean field, the first most energetic group of modes is related to trailing vortices induced by the Rushton turbines and is associated to a frequency equivalent to the blade passage frequency and its overtones. The second most energetic group of modes is related to vortical structures in the impeller stream and is associated to a frequency equivalent to the rotating speed. DMD analysis identifies flow structures that are found similar to these most energetic modes, although differences appear due to the fact that DMD isolates structures associated to a single frequency and their corresponding growth/decay rate. As in POD, the relative importance of each DMD mode can be estimated using an appropriately defined energy criterion. Comparison of the results from both modal decomposition methods points out their complementarity and their potential for describing the spatial and time characteristics of the flow within a stirred tank.

AB Discrete element method (DEM) has been widely used to study granular materials. However, how to model non-spherical particles is still challenging. Ellipsoidal particles are a typical kind of non-spherical particles in DEM simulations. There are three common methods to calculate the overlap and contact force between two ellipsoidal particles, namely, geometric potential (GP), common normal (CN) and overlap region (OR) methods. These methods are based on different physical concepts and hence will give different results. However, the comprehensive evaluation of these methods is still lacking, leaving DEM users no solid reference for selecting algorithms. In this paper, we conduct detailed comparisons on the penetration depth, contact plane and contact point predicted by the three methods. Particularly, using the orientation discretization method, the results are compared in all orientations quantitatively. It is shown that the difference between GP and CN is the largest whereas OR is always in between. The difference in contact point is relatively small when overlap ratio is small, whereas the difference in contact plane can always be large. Further, the results are directly compared to those obtained from sub-particle scale finite element analyses, which reveals that CN can always accurately predict contact plane and most times contact point, while GP are relatively better in predicting force magnitude. This study not only gives a more clear and comprehensive evaluation of different contact force models for ellipsoidal particles but also establishes an effective framework for comparing and verifying contact force models for general non-spherical particles.

AB Influence of roll motion on the mass transfer performance in laboratory- and pilot-scale structured-packing columns was investigated. A six-degree-of-freedom motion parallel platform was adopted to mimic different sea states of roll motion, and the relative change in the mass-transfer area caused by roll motion was obtained using an air-NaOH system. The experimental results showed that both enhanced and deteriorative mass transfer phenomena could be induced by roll motion, which results from the combined effect involving the operating conditions, packing types and sea states. Based on these results, a nominal maximum rolling velocity was proposed. The nominal maximum rolling velocity was positively correlated with the relative change in the mass-transfer area. Furthermore, the results indicated that tilt could be regarded as an extreme sea state of roll motion. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Studies of the rock matrix acidizing for enhanced recovery of oil or gas have entirely focused on the fully water saturated conditions. In fact, matrix acidizing can be conducted in low-water-cut oil-production wells without pre-flushing of water or in high water production by injecting gas or oil ahead of the acid injection. These conditions yield a multiphase system, where the dynamics of acid transport and reactions can be altered by the presence of an immiscible phase. Against this backdrop, we present an investigation of the impact of initial saturation of an immiscible phase in the damaged zone on the efficiency of wormhole generation and growth in acidizing operations. We present a dimensionless two-phase reactive transport modelling tailored for studying the processes associated with rock acidizing. For a case study of acid injection into calcite with random porosity and permeability distribution, we show that an initial two-phase condition has positive feedback on the generation of wormholes. The results, however, indicate that the relative magnitude of reduction in the amount of pore volume of injected acid to produce effective wormholes depends on the mobility ratio, so that a higher mobility ratio facilitates a faster wormhole generation process. Under the conditions of modelling study presented, we demonstrate that in addition to the commonly used pair of Peclet-Damkohler regime identification, the mobility ratio of the displacing/displaced fluids, the relative permeability and phase condition need be accounted for in the analysis, if there are two-phase flow conditions across the target region of acidizing.

AB In the present study, gas phase characteristics of oil-gas-water slug and churn flows in a vertical upward pipe with 20 mm inner diameter (ID) are experimentally investigated. We firstly measure the fluctuating signals of a traversable bi-optical fiber probe at different radial positions. The gas phase flow parameter distributions (local gas velocity, local gas holdup) are obtained and the flow structure is uncovered by calculating the series of gas bubble chord lengths at different radial positions. Additionally, in order to describe the flow structure of slug flow, the relative length of the liquid slug, the profile distributions of gas holdup and bubble size in liquid slug are investigated. To understand the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of slug and churn flows, multi-scale cross entropy (MSCE) algorithm is applied to analyze the signals of a high-resolution half-ring conductance sensor and bi-optical fiber probe. The result indicates that multi-scale cross entropy can be an effective tool for validating the measurement of gas phase characteristics by using the traversable bi-optical fiber probe.

AB Enantioselective extraction of metoprolol (MT) enantiomers with di-cyclohexyl (D)-tartrate (DT) and boric acid (BA) as chiral extractant was performed. The process involving multiple chemical equilibrium is very complicated and the process optimization is difficult. On the basis of an interfacial reaction mechanism, a single-stage extraction model was established. The operation conditions of pH and DT to BA ratio were obtained through simulation and optimization of the equilibrium of the two phase extraction system. Based on the single-stage extraction model and the law of mass conservation, a fractional extraction model was established to simulate and optimize the fractional extraction process. To pursue a high productivity and reduce the required stages, a high feed to aqueous phase ratio (F/W = 1) and an asymmetric separation mode were applied. By asymmetric separation where the optical purity of the product in extract phase and raffiniate phase is not equal, enantiomeric excess (ee) value for the eutomer of MT can reach up to 98.64% and yield can reach up to 64.68% with 20 extraction stages.

AB Antoine is mainly known for the equation usually used for predicting vapor pressure of pure compounds that bears his name. In this article we show a little known equation of state (EoS), as well as its functionality to predict current PvT properties of more than forty compounds including industrial, noble, and organic gases. The Antoine EoS has been parameterized in three regions: P-r < 1.2, 1.2 <= P-r <= 10 and P-r > 10 in order to improve its performance in the widest possible area. The proposed sets of optimized parameters were fitted by minimizing deviations after comparing predicted values with available experimental data in open literature.
   The volumes predicted with the optimized Antoine EoS have been compared with those calculated with the widely-known Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK), Peng-Robinson-Stryjek-Vera (PRSV2) and Valderrama-Patel-Teja (VPT) equations of state. Results obtained by using the optimized Antoine EoS show better accuracy in the zone of high reduced pressures for all compounds and, in a more general way, for most of the compounds in the remaining zones than the other equations of state. The extension to noble gases and other compounds originally not taken into account by Antoine have been successfully achieved. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The main objectives of this study were to quantify the classification efficiency of a binary mixture of two different particle types and to demonstrate that CPFD can be used to simulate the main features of the classification process. A lab-scale cylindrical fluidized bed (8.4 cm inner diameter, 150 cm height), equipped with pressure sensors and a video camera for recordings, was applied in the experiments. The particles used in the study were ceramic beads (median diameter 70 mm, skeletal density 3830 kg/m(3)) and steel shot (290 mm, 7790 kg/m3). Ambient air was used as the fluidization medium.
   The minimum fluidization velocities of pure ceramic beads and steel shot were found to be 0.015 m/s and 0.240 m/s, respectively. In the experiments with a binary mixture of the two materials, the fluidization column was filled by alternating layers of ceramic beads and steel shot. In principle, segregation of the two particle types can be obtained by applying a suitable gas velocity within the interval defined by the two minimum fluidization velocities, resulting in a top layer of mainly lighter and smaller particles (flotsam) and a bottom layer of mainly heavier and larger particles (jetsam). In the experiments, the air velocity was gradually increased until the entire bed was fluidized. A gradual rearrangement of the multi-layer structure into a two-layer structure was observed. The rearrangement started at the top and then progressed downwards until most of the steel particles were collected at the bottom of the bed and practically all the ceramic beads were gathered at the top. The velocity at which the flotsam and jetsam layers were clearly segregated was found to be 0.180 m/s. The jetsam layer contained less than 0.3 wt% ceramic beads indicating that an almost pure steel shot fraction could be produced through fluidized bed classification. The flotsam layer was, however, less pure, with a steel shot content up to 24 wt%, suggesting that this layer may need a second classification stage for improved purity.
   Computational particle-fluid dynamics (CPFD) simulations of the same setup were performed using the commercial software Barracuda. The simulated minimum fluidization velocity of steel shot, applying the Ergun drag model, perfectly matched the experimental value. For the ceramic beads, however, the simulations, applying the Wen-Yu drag model, gave a value lower than the experimental value. Still, the simulations were able to capture the general behavior of the particles in the bed observed in the classification experiments, i.e. the rearrangement of the layers, even if a higher gas velocity was required for complete classification of the particles. The formation of air pockets was also observed in the simulations, as in some of the experiments. The results suggest that Barracuda CPFD simulations can be a useful tool in design and evaluation of fluidized bed classifiers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A pseudo-steady state based (PSSA) deterministic solution strategy is presented to calculate the concentrations of single and multi-arm macrospecies types in reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, accounting for chain length dependent apparent rate coefficients to fully reflect the impact of diffusional limitations. The simulation time is of minute scale and diffusional limitation on termination are accounted for with the RAFT-chain length dependent-termination technique. Based on an extensive set of experimental data (18 conditions), addition and fragmentation kinetic parameters are determined for RAFT polymerization of styrene initiated by 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) and 2-cyano-2-propyl dodecyl trithiocarbonate. Due to higher chain length dependent apparent termination rates, a rate retardation with respect to the free radical polymerization (FRP) results despite that a simplified degenerative mechanism can be considered. This rate retardation is enhanced for polymerizations exhibiting a stronger gel-effect (e.g. methyl methacrylate). Then even the average RAFT polymerization characteristics cannot be reliably calculated by approximating the macroradical chain length distribution (CLD) through a Poisson or Schulz-Flory distribution. The calculation of the macroradical CLD always requires a full kinetic model taking into account the chain length dependencies for all individual chain lengths. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The permeation of an oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion through a coalescing filter was numerically studied using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). A numerical simulation model for the coalescing phenomena was developed based on the free-energy LBM. We investigated the effects of the wettability of fibers, filter porosity, and fiber diameter on the coalescing behaviors by performing two-dimensional permeation simulations for the O/W emulsions through modeled fibrous filters. We mainly focused on hydrophilic filters because they did not generate small secondary droplets during oil droplet detachment from the filter, and this is preferred for precise separation of oil and water. Our simulations demonstrated that filters with larger pore spacings enable formation of larger droplets but allow more droplets to pass without coalescing. To solve this problem, we designed bi-layered filters composed of a small-pore filter to accurately catch the droplets and a large-pore filter to enlarge the droplets; we demonstrated the effectiveness of the bilayer structure for membrane coalescence.

AB 'A membrane usually suffers from a reduction in membrane rejection performance when exposed to a concentrated salt solution. A fabricated polyimide (PI)/graphene oxide (GO) mixed matrix membrane (MMM) was prepared at different GO/PI concentrations (ranging from 0 to 3.5 wt%) to investigate membrane performance in diluted and concentrated salt solutions. Results showed that the MMM possess nanofiltration (NF) properties with high water permeability and excellent salt rejection (99%) in diluted conditions regardless of the applied filtration pressure. The water and permeate permeability increased with the increase in GO content. Interestingly, for concentrated salt solutions, PI/GO MMM only showed at most 4% reduction in rejection, unlike in pure PI membrane, which experienced 16% reduction. A higher amorphous region of the MMM compared to the pure PI in salt solutions was found through XRD. The ionization of GO increases the amorphous structure thus enhances the effective thickness of membrane maintaining the MMM rejection performance. 0.9 wt% GO/PI in MMM showed the highest rejection (98%) in 0.15 M Na2SO4. The presence of GO with its unique properties and highly porous structure was found to retain the membrane rejection properties, especially in concentrated solution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A plunging jet is an efficient device to entrain gas into liquid flow. In many practical occasions, the gas entrainment needs to be carefully controlled, and the interaction between the shear flow turbulence and entrained bubbles has to be better understood. This paper presents a physical study of vertical supported two-dimensional plunging jets using a relatively large-size facility. The air-water flow and turbulence properties were measured with an intrusive phase-detection probe and a total pressure sensor simultaneously. The inflow pre-aeration and turbulence level of the falling jet were carefully characterised, and the effects of jet impact velocity and jet length on air entrainment in plunging pool were investigated. The experimental results were systematically compared to relevant studies. A discussion was developed on the quantification of turbulence intensity in highly-aerated flow based on total pressure measurement. The flow turbulence properties were derived respectively from the interfacial phase-detection signals and total pressure signals. The results highlighted difference in terms of the turbulence intensities between interfacial motions and water-phase turbulence. The present work showed that the jet impact velocity, jet length, inflow disturbance and pre-entrainment of air had considerable effects on air entrainment capacity and subsurface air-water flow properties in plunging jets hence should be carefully characterised in relevant studies.

AB Microbubble-agitated extraction was conducted with microextractors for process intensification of extraction with high phase ratio. Hexanoic-acid/water/n-octanol system with phase ratio of 80 was selected as a model system. Single and double membrane dispersion modules were developed for generating liquid-liquid and gas-liquid-liquid microdispersion systems. 10 different methods, 6 of which containing microbubbles, were designed to realize high-phase-ratio extraction. The effect of dispersion size, structure of gas-liquid-liquid emulsion and amount of microbubbles were systematically investigated. The most efficient and stable mode was recommended, with which Murphree efficiency could reach 90% in 0.5 s and the overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient ranges in 7.88-41.34 s(-1), about 40 times greater than liquid-liquid system. The mechanism of the intensification effect by introducing microbubbles was discussed. Two typical gas-liquid-liquid structures were selected to study the effects of microbubbles in adjusting phase ratio and promoting turbulence in continuous phase. Two dimensionless equations were established to correlate mass tranfer coefficients respectively, both of which showed good coincidence with experimental data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In anticipation of the successful establishment of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technology, a pilot-scale aqueous mineral carbonation plant, that removes CO2 through a reaction with a Ca(OH)(2) solution, was built in Incheon, South Korea. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), two reactors with a diameter of 2.2 m and a height of 6.0 m were modeled and validated for reactor scale-up and optimization. Because a direct simulation of bubble breakage, coalescence, and interphase mass transfer results in enormous computational costs for modeling the pilot-scale multiphase reactor, a CFD-lumped correlation model was introduced to simulate a large reactor; this resulted in acceptable computational costs and maintained the simulation accuracy. In order to ensure the acceptability of the CFD model, two-step verification was conducted. The CFD model results were compared with the experimental data and published empirical correlations with regard to the gas holdup, interfacial area, and mass transfer coefficient. Subsequently, the CO2 removal efficiencies of the CFD model were compared with the pilot-plant data. The errors of the CFD model for three hydrodynamic parameters and the CO2 removal efficiencies were in the range of 1-8%. The validated CFD model will be used for designing a four times larger mineral carbonation reactor, that will be built in 2017. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID GAS-FLUIDIZED BEDS
AB Concentrated solar power (CSP) plants conventionally make use of molten salt as the heat transfer medium, which transfers heat between the solar receiver and a steam turbine power circuit. A new approach uses particles of a heat-resistant particulate medium in the form of many dense upward-moving fluidised beds contained within an array of vertical tubes within the solar receiver. In most dense gas-solid fluidisation systems, particle circulation is induced by bubble motion and is the primary cause of particle convective heat transfer, which is the major contributing mechanism to overall heat transfer. The current work describes experiments designed to investigate the relationship between this solids convection and the heat transfer coefficient between the bed and the tube wall, which is shown to depend on the local particle concentration and their rate of renewal at the wall. Experiments were performed using 65 mu m silicon carbide particles in a tube of diameter 30 mu m, replicating the conditions used in the real application. Solids motion and time-averaged solids concentration were measured using Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT) and local heat transfer coefficients measured using small probes which employ electrical resistance heating and thermocouple temperature measurement. Results show that, as for other types of bubbling beds, the heat transfer coefficient first increases as the gas flow rate increases (because the rate of particle renewal at the wall increases), before passing through a maximum and decreasing again as the reducing local solids concentration at the wall becomes the dominant effect. Measured heat transfer coefficients are compared with theoretical approaches by Mickley and Fairbanks packet model and Thring correlation. The close correspondence between heat transfer coefficient and solids movement is here demonstrated by PEPT for the first time in a dense upward-moving fluidised bed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A fast and accurate control of the flow temperature by heating or cooling through the wall is essential for many chemical applications, in particular to achieve optimal reaction intensification. A numerical study based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been done to investigate thermal homogenization within a horizontally-coiled helical pipe. The main target is to examine and compare the flow and mixing characteristics when heating different axial parts of the coil. The entrance region and two other locations within the fully-developed flow region have been investigated for that purpose; the first, the third and the fifth turn of a ten-turn coil have been heated individually. In each case, temperature field and thermal homogenization were assessed. The performance was quantified in terms of the required axial length for the temperature profile to become uniform again after heating. The investigations were performed for water as a working fluid, and for a wide range of Reynolds numbers between 2000 and 16,000, covering both the laminar range and transition to turbulence in the helical pipe. The thermal mixing performance in the entrance region was found to be noticeably better than that in the fully-developed region, increasingly so at higher Reynolds numbers. Therefore, it is recommended to systematically use the entrance region of a coil reactor for a fast and efficient step rise of the flow temperature. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Selective oxidation of hydrocarbons is of great industrial importance. Nanocarbons are recently found highly active for the aerobic oxidation of cumene. In this work, a detailed kinetics study of cumene oxidation catalyzed by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and nitrogen doped CNTs (NCNTs) was carried out to disclose the crucial influence of N doping in the cumene oxidation. A kinetics model based on the radical reaction mechanism of cumene oxidation was developed, which contained 7 major elementary steps. The kinetics parameters of cumene oxidation upon CNTs and N-doped CNTs (NCNTs) were obtained by the non-linear aggression of the experimental concentration-time data. Mechanistic insights into the effect of N-doping on carbon catalysis were achieved by comparing the kinetics parameters of CNTs and NCNTs. The decomposition of ROOH was found to be the rate-determine step of the cumene oxidation. The nitrogen doping could reduce the activation energy of CHP decomposition, thereby could remarkably accelerate the overall reaction rate of cumene oxidation. The nitrogen doping could also strengthen the interactions between O-2, RO center dot, RO2 center dot and the carbon catalysts. Hence, the selectivities to acetophenone and 2-benzyl-2-propanol were improved. This study provides the insight towards the catalytic role of N dopants in the aerobic oxidation of cumene.

AB An efficient catalyst for the direct hydroxylation of benzene to phenol with H2O2 was prepared via the anchor of H5PMo10V2O40 (PMoV2) by -OH of Titania nanotubes (TNT) via electrostatic interaction between the Keggin unit of PMoV2 and -OH. The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), solid-state P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (solid-state P-31 NMR), Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) demonstrated that PMoV2 was successfully immobilized on the surface of Titania nanotubes by electrostatic interaction. The textural and morphology of PMoV2/Titania nanotubes were characterized by N-2 adsorption-desorption, scanning electronic micrograph (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). PMoV2/Titania nanotubes shows excellent catalytic performance in the hydroxylation of benzene with a 27.3% benzene conversion and 99.1% selectivity to phenol. The results of contact angle and adsorption experiments demonstrate that excellent catalytic performance is attributed to the confinement effect of Titania nanotubes with the nanotube structure and hydrophobic microenvironment, which effectively disperse PMoV2 and concentrate the reactants as well as decrease intrinsic mass transfer resistance. The anchor effect of -OH stabilizes and inhibits the leak of PMoV2, leading to good catalytic recyclability with almost unchanged catalytic efficiency after six recycling tests in the acid reaction condition.

AB A major challenge for the production of bio-ethanol is to develop yeast that can sustain growth under high temperature. Here, we show the application of an artificial protein quality control (APQC) system to an industrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain for improving thermo-tolerance, a key trait for a bioethanol fermentation program. All engineered strains exhibited a significantly higher growth rate and cell viability at 37 degrees C, which conferred increased thermo-tolerance and more efficient glucose conversion to ethanol. Furthermore, the analysis of ubiquitination and the enzyme activities of pyruvate kinase (PK) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) indicated strengthened protein quality, implying that proteostasis had been effectively improved at higher temperature. Industrial material fermentation results from yeast-RSP5-UBC4 (combined expression of ubiquitin conjugated enzyme E2 and ubiquitin ligase E3) showed a 2.4% increase in ethanol production. All these findings prove that APQC is suitable for improving yeast resistance to high temperature during industrial bio-ethanol production. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study is to develop a bio-combustion system integrated into a photobioreactor. Different oxidizers (a simulated industrial gas stream containing 5.5% O-2, 18% CO2 and 76.5% N-2, the atmospheric air and the photobioreactor exhaust gases in different residence times) were injected into the combustion chamber, and combustion temperature, combustion stability, heating rate, and fuel conversion were analyzed. The results have shown that the use of photobioreactor exhaust gases as oxidizer, biofuel, and nitrogen diluent in the combustion furnace, have increased the thermal efficiency of the system, with heating rates 30.5% and 45.8% higher than the atmospheric air and the simulated industrial gas stream, respectively. Thus, the integration of these processes could be considered a viable strategy to improve the combustion systems thermal performance, efficiently contributing to the sustainability and economy of industrial operations.

AB Turbulent flow characteristics and vortex behaviors in the pore space of real packed beds under different flow conditions is numerically investigated. Real geometric structure of randomly packed beds is modeled using the discrete element software LIGGGHTS. Both LES and RANS methods are employed to predict vortex shape and evolution features at pore scale in actual packed beds. The numerical model is validated corresponding to experimental data, a good agreement is achieved between predicted results and measurements. Based on the computational results, the distribution characteristics of vorticity and velocity in multiple representative special structures are analysed, such as the channel formed by two pellets, similar triangle area formed by compact spherical walls and channel. Besides the effects of special structures on vortex shape and turbulence intensity is studied, such as the guiding and friction effect by the side spherical wall on gas motion, and strong shear force on both sides of the main channel. The Q criterion is used to identify vortex structures and capture distribution and evolution of vortexes in the computational domain. Moreover, the effect of inlet velocity on the position and shape of eddies is investigated, and eddy morphological changes under unsteady inlet conditions are also discussed., At last, a comparison between LES and RANS methods shows that the LES method can capture more details of the distribution and shape of the vortexes in the pore space, and therefore it is more suitable to the complicated flow field in porous media.

AB The wettability of a reservoir rock is an important property affecting the states of fluids in pores that are constructed with minerals of various types. However, the mineral grains are usually micro-sized so that the traditional optical contact angle method is hard to be applied to study their wettabilities. Although some measurements have been carried out for the contact angles of liquids on mineral surfaces, those previous studies were mainly on flat artificial mineral surfaces. To understand the wettabilities of water on rough natural mineral surfaces, the contact angles of micro-sized water droplets on relatively rough quartz surfaces in a natural sand rock were measured with an atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results obtained show that the droplets were asymmetrical so that the contact angles, which were around 27.8-50.3 degrees, were different along the triple-phase contact lines, probably due to surface roughness, heterogeneity, atomic arrangement, etc. As compared with previous studies, surface pretreatment and droplet size were regarded as the two key factors that caused the substantial difference in contact angles of water on quartz between the current and previous researches, which might imply that the present results could better describe the wettability of a natural reservoir rock.

AB Aided by self-agglomeration, a two-stage reduction process conducted at a higher temperature ( 600 degrees C) than the single-stage process resulted in an enhancement of the k constant to more than twice that of the single-stage process. A force balance model coupled with the reduction kinetics of Fe2O3 is first proposed to explain the self-agglomeration mechanism of iron nanoparticles (NPs) during the reduction. This force balance model successfully elucidates the reason for the prevention of defluidization via a two-stage fluidized bed method. At lower temperatures, there is a long stationary phase, which is of great importance in overcoming the sintering of agglomerates and in promoting the reduction reaction. At lower temperatures, the initial NPs first self-agglomerate into particles that are tens of microns in size; they then gradually agglomerate into larger particles (> 100 mu m) at higher temperatures. By contrast, the sudden growth of iron NP agglomerates causes sintering and defluidization in the single-stage fluidized bed method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We propose a novel reaction scheme for the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of Al films on substrates from dimethylethylamine alane (DMEAA), supported by the prediction of the Al deposition rate as a function of process temperature. The scheme is based on gas phase oligomerizations of alane which form a substantial amount of intermediates. Combined with reversible surface dehydrogenation steps, the global deposition reaction is composed of a set of 12 chemical reactions. This new scheme entails four intermediates and includes side reactions that play an important role in the formation of Al thin films. The chemistry mechanism is incorporated in a 2D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of the CVD reactor setup used for the experimental investigation. The simulation predictions of the Al deposition rate are in good agreement with corresponding experimental measurements. The success of this novel reaction pathway lies in its ability to capture the abrupt decrease of the deposition rate at temperatures above 200 degrees C, which is attributed to the gas phase consumption of alane along with its increased desorption rate from the film surface.

AB In this work, we characterized and tested the oxygen permeation properties of BaCo0.85Bi0.05Zr0.1O3-delta (BCBZ) hollow fibre membranes fabricated by a combined phase inversion for spinning and sintering route using polyetherimide (PEI) as the polymer binder. The powder X-ray diffraction results showed that the BCBZ powder for spinning had to be calcined at around 950 degrees C to form a hexagonal phase structure, while the hollow fibre precursors were sintered at 1150-1200 degrees C to form the cubic perovskite structure for oxygen permeation. It displayed the highest oxygen flux of 7.3 cm(3) (STP) cm (2) min (1) at 950 degrees C under an air/He gradient. The theoretical correlation of the oxygen fluxes at different operating conditions showed that the oxygen permeation through BCBZ fibre was limited by surface exchange reactions. Carbon dioxide (CO2) resistance of BCBZ hollow fibre was tested by exposing it to alternating different sweep gas containing helium (He), 20% CO2 in He, 80% CO2 in He, and pure He. Despite the significant reduction in oxygen fluxes upon subjected to CO2-containing sweep gases due to the strong CO2 sorption on the membrane surface, no permanent damage on the membrane was detected and the original flux could be recovered at the end of the 105-h test once the sweep gas was switched back to helium. This result clearly highlights the high CO2 resistance of BCBZ hollow fibre membrane due to the presence of Zr4+ with higher acidity than Co2+ in BCBZ perovskite lattice. High CO2 tolerance enables the membrane use as membrane reactors for more advanced applications where the presence of CO2-containing atmosphere is unavoidable. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The knowledge of the flow distribution inside microstructured reactors is valuable e.g. for improving the reactor design, developing flow distributors, and optimizing the catalyst loading method. The applicability of the hot-wire anemometry (HWA) technique for experimental determination of the flow distribution inside a multi-stack micro-packed bed reactor is demonstrated for the first time. The anemometry data is then evaluated in relation to the reactor performance for methanol synthesis under relevant industrial operating conditions. A 400 mm long hot-wire connected to a constant temperature anemometer was applied for scanning the flow out of a specially designed reactor model, clamped on a motorized table equipped with a precise positioning system. The anemometry measurements revealed a non-uniformity in the catalyst packing, partially resulting from the reactor design. The flow distribution is poorer for smaller particles and for wider particle size distributions, and worsens as the superficial flow velocity (and the pressure drop) decreases. The effects of the packing nonuniformity on the reactor performance appear minor under methanol synthesis conditions. They could, however, turn out significant upon pushing the overall conversion in the whole reactor towards equilibrium as the synthesis reaction is exothermic, and temperature increase does alleviate the problem. The reactor design should be modified instead. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A kinetic model of CO2 adsorption on an amine-functionalized silica sorbent, 0.37EB-PEI, was proposed by using experimental data from a miniature isothermal fixed bed reactor system called Autochem. Breakthrough curve tests were conducted at different CO2 concentrations and different temperatures to acquire experimental data under adsorption-dominant conditions. Additionally, temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments were carried out for different CO2 concentrations with different starting temperatures to investigate the desorption kinetics. A modified Langmuir kinetic equation was found to provide a satisfactory representation of the adsorption-dominant experimental data, including the long tails. A separate kinetic model was proposed to express the desorption-dominant TPD data. The dynamic effects of the empty volume in the Autochem device on the experimental measurements were rigorously handled through separate empty-volume dynamic tests. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB An alternative to flaring of surplus natural gas is methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) to benzene (C6H6) over a bifunctional molybdenum/zeolite catalyst. Byproducts include H-2, C2H4, and naphthalene (C10H8). While an MDA detailed elementary reaction mechanism is now available, a simpler global kinetic model is more useful for engineering and screening calculations. A literature three-step reaction model exists but with rate constants only at 950 K. In the current work, Arrhenius parameters for the three global reactions have been determined over 948-1023 K based on a regression of major gas species concentration data generated from Chemkin (R) simulations of a packed bed reactor running the detailed MDA mechanism. In addition, the three-step model is used to illustrate the need to remove H-2, perhaps through a membranous reactor wall, in order to overcome strong equilibrium CH4 conversion limitations. Such H-2 removal, though, improves C10H8 selectivity at the expense of C6H6. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The high-pressure homogenizer (HPH) is, together with the rotor-stator mixer (RSM), the standard equipment for emulsification in many fields of chemical processing. Both give rise to intense turbulence which, in turn, gives rise to drop breakup. Previous investigations focus on average turbulent disruptive stress. However, turbulence is a stochastic phenomenon and drop breakup will be characterized by instantaneous stresses, or more specifically by the probability distribution of instantaneous turbulent stresses.
   This study uses high-resolution particle image velocimetry (PIV) data to measure the probability distribution of turbulent stresses in the HPH. It is concluded that stress distributions approximately follow a lognormal model and that the skewness of the distributions decreases with increasing distance from the gap exit until a constant distribution shape is obtained at the position where the turbulence is fully developed. This converged stress distribution is similar to that obtained for RSMs in previous studies, suggesting that stress distribution shape is a general property. Moreover, large differences are observed when comparing these experimental stress distributions to the most widely used expression for describing this stochastic effect in fragmentation rate models. This indicates that the traditionally used fragmentation rate models can be fundamentally flawed, at least in relation to RSM and HPH emulsification. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A numerical methodology based on dual grid dual level set function is presented for simulating 2D multiphase flows through complex geometries on a non-body fitted Cartesian computational grid. A Cut Cell based immersed boundary method (IBM) is used to sharply resolve complex geometries. The cut cells near the immersed boundary are identified using a fictitious level set function. The governing equations are discretized using the finite volume method (FVM) on a m x n staggered grid. The dynamics of fluid-fluid interface is tracked by an other level set function defined on dual grid (2m x 2n). The use of dual grid arrangement for fictitious level set function results in an accurate calculation of diffusion and advection fluxes at the cut cell near the immersed boundary. A module by module validation of the developed numerical methodology is carried out with several test cases. Two single phase flow problems corresponds to Poiseuille flow and flow through a convergent-divergent section while the two multiphase problems selected are the standard Young's Laplace law test - semicircular fluid rod on a horizontal surface - and the bubble rise phenomenon in an inclined channel. The obtained results show an excellent agreement with those derived analytically or taken from literature. Furthermore, the performance study carried out on the present model shows that the method is between first and second order accurate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Flow distributors are extensively adopted by chemical industry to distribute process fluid for the downstream equipment. Conventional flow distributors in general have limited number of outlets. Their low outlet densities cannot distribute the incoming process stream uniformly and efficiently, which consequently undermine the overall equipment performance. In contrast, fractal distributors can achieve high outlet densities because of their inherent self-similarity feature. In this study, we fabricated two fractal packs of novel plate and frame designs. Each fractal pack was comprised of a fractal distributor, a resin bed and a fractal collector. The fractal distributors/collectors in these two fractal packs have 256 and 16 outlets/inlets, respectively. In this study, we carried out both CFD modeling and experiments to understand the effect of outlet density on the hydrodynamics of the downstream resin bed. By comparing the predicted velocity fields and the measured residence time distribution (RTD) curves, we noticed that a fractal distributor of high outlet density can distribute the process stream uniformly at a low pressure drop to the resin bed. The process streams entering the resin bed reach plug flow profile within a short bed depth. As a result of the uniform flow distribution, mal-distribution such as channeling and dead space are minimized, and the process streams have a uniform RTD in the fractal pack. In comparison, the fractal distributor of low outlet density, which mimics some aspects of a conventional distributor, is found to have severe mal-distribution in the resin bed and consequently poor RTD inside the fractal packs. In addition, the RTD analysis confirms that the fractal distributor of high outlet density shows consistently good distributing performance for a wide range of operating flow rates. This study confirms the advantages of fractal distributors over conventional ones and demonstrates the benefit of fractal distributors in improving the overall performance of chemical equipment, indicating that fractal distributors are promising to enable process intensification for the chemical industry.

AB Real time monitoring of physiological characteristics during a cultivation process is of great importance in the pharmaceutical industry. Measuring biomass, product, substrate and precursor concentrations continuously however is limited due to time-consuming laboratory analysis or expensive and hard-to-handle devices. In this work, a particle filter algorithm for estimating these difficult-to-measure process states in a Penicillium chrysogenum fed-batch cultivation is presented. The implemented particle filter represents a new algorithmic framework, combining several already existing methods and techniques for state estimation. It is based on nonlinear process and measurement models and takes into account both online measurements for state estimation and time delayed offline measurements, ensuring the observability of the considered system and being essential for the adaptation of dynamic model parameters. The application on real experimental data showed the convincing performance of the algorithm, estimating biomass, precursor and product concentration, as well as the specific growth rate, requiring standard measurements only. Furthermore, the positive effect of parameter estimation with respect to estimation quality was analyzed and the effect of the time delay was highlighted exemplarily. Despite of being computationally expensive due to time delayed data, the algorithm can be considered as an alternative monitoring strategy for industrial applications. Thus, it can be used further for process understanding and control. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates a thin liquid film flowing down the interior or exterior surface of a vertical uniformly heated cylinder under the influence of gravity. A thin liquid film model, which is applicable to both cases, is derived to examine the Marangoni effect on the spatial-temporal dynamics. Linear stability analysis predicts that an absolutely unstable mode could be initiated by the Marangoni effect even if the film thickness is very thin compared to the cylinder's radius. The linear stability analysis shows that the instability is always absolute for arbitrary capillary number if a composite Marangoni number M = 3MaBi/2(1+Bi)(2) exceeds a critical value M =root-17+7 root 7/3 approximate to 0.71(Ma is the Marangoni number, and Bi is the Biot number). Direct numerical simulations of the linearized and the full thin film model demonstrated the linear analysis. Results of the direct numerical simulations also show that the film has a strong tendency to break up into more droplets or rupture in the absolute instability regime. Nonlinear study also shows that the coalescence of droplets/ring waves and bound state are weakly dependent on the absolute or convective instability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently an efficient method for the simulation of packed bed adsorbers with implicit adsorption isotherms was presented. It uses a method of lines approach and exploits standard software for the simultaneous solution of the resulting differential algebraic equations (DAEs). Application was demonstrated for stoichiometric ion exchange. In the present paper, the approach is extended to systems described by the adsorbed solution theory. For that purpose, the relation between the differential index of the DAE system and the spectral properties of the underlying adsorption equilibrium is established. In particular, it is shown that real and positive eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the underlying conservation equations will lead to a differential index of one. It is further shown that real and positive eigenvalues of the Jacobian related to the IAST can be guaranteed for binary mixtures with any type of pure component adsorption isotherm or for multicomponent mixtures with certain restricted types of pure component isotherms. The new method is illustrated for different explicit and implicit pure component adsorption isotherms belonging to this class. It is compared with alternative solution approaches using the modified FastIAS method by Do and Myers and semi-analytical solutions from equilibrium theory. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The use of nanomedicine for diagnosing, treatment and/or monitoring of diseases can change the viscosity of blood and lead to different pressure drop and wall shear stress in an atherosclerotic coronary artery. In the present study, in a typical atherosclerotic coronary artery, the effect of iron-oxide nano-particles (Fe3O4) on the blood hemodynamics was studied. Dynamic viscosity as a function of the nano-particles' volume fraction in the blood was predicted through a nonlinear equation, and Herschel-Bulkley model was used to model the shear stress. For the non-Newtonian fluid, the equation of motion was solved for a tapered tube of different diameters. Experimental design based on Taguchi approach and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was employed to study the effect of different hemodynamic parameters on the pressure drop. It was shown that increasing the nano-particles' volume fraction (ranging from 0 to 0.5%) increases the pressure drop to a maximum amount, and a further increase in the volume fraction up to 2% leads to a decrease in the pressure drop. Furthermore, the shear rate at the wall increases with the volume fraction of the nano-particles to a maximum value and then slightly decreases. It was observed that, to some extent, injection of nanoparticles especially into narrow blood channels such as atherosclerotic coronary arteries could variously affect the blood flow pressure drop. These findings suggest that for patients with the atherosclerotic problem the nanomedicine injection dose can be important, which could be encouraging from practical and biomedical engineering points of view.

AB A model based on the Generalized van der Waals partition function is derived to predict the adsorption of square-well fluid in slit pores of any size, the walls of which also have square-well potential. The space inside the pore is divided into several regions based on the extent of the attractive regions generated by the walls. Closed-form expressions of the chemical potentials of the confined fluid in different regions in the pore are obtained. The densities of fluid in different regions are calculated by equalizing the chemical potentials of fluid in those regions to that of the bulk phase. To examine the accuracy of the model, the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation is also conducted. We find that the model well captures the effects of the bulk conditions and the properties of adsorbate and pore on the density of adsorbate in the pore. The model is also shown to be able to predict the adsorption of real gases in various activated carbons. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Continuum models have been extensively used in CFD simulation of gas-solid flow, which is usually closed with a kinetic theory of granular flow for particulate phase stresses and a correlation for interphase drag force. Particle velocity distribution function (PVDF) is the cornerstone of kinetic theory of granular flow and the PVDFs in gas-solid flow can be Maxwellian, bimodal and/ or non-Maxwellian with an overpopulated high-energy tail, depending on the physical nature of gas-solid flow. Here we theoretically show that the different PVDFs can be unified under the umbrella of a recently proposed kinetic theory framework (Wang et al., 2016) and the root of different PVDFs lies in the different characteristics of mesoscale structures. Validation of theoretical analysis is then carried out by comparing the theoretical prediction with experimental and DNS data available in literature. The findings of present study offer a possibility of developing a unified kinetic theory for gas-solid flows. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been applied extensively for studying rotor-stator mixers (RSM) in the past, both as a design-tool and in modelling mixing and emulsification. Modelling is always a balance between accuracy and computational cost. The theoretically soundest methods (i.e. fully resolved transient simulations) have often been deemed unfeasible, and the majority of previously published studies use severe simplifications (i.e. k-epsilon models for turbulence and multiple reference frame for rotation). High quality experimental validation is in great need, but are rare, due to the lack of local fluid velocity measurement.
   Experimental validations of CFD on RSMs have previously been provided using laser Doppler anemometry. This study provides the first validation using particle image velocimetry, allowing for substantially higher spatial resolution than with the previously used techniques. The objective of this study is to map the possibilities and limitations of these commonly used CFD modelling approaches for RSMs. Special emphasis is put on validating the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). Despite being the parameter used for linking CFD to mixing or dispersion models, this has not been the subject of experimental validation in previous studies.
   Based on the validations, a list of best practice recommendations are given (in terms of turbulence model, mesh resolution and rotation formulation). When adhering to these, the CFD model accurately captures power draw, flow number, and the detailed velocity field inside the region where mixing and dispersion takes place. The dissipation rate of TKE is captured qualitatively but underestimate experimental values. Implications in terms of limitations are discussed in detail, including estimations of accuracy implications for emulsification and mixing modelling. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We optimize the extractive distillation process for separating the acetonitrile - water azeotropic mixture with ethylene glycol by using a multi-objective genetic algorithm for minimizing under purity constraints the total cost, the energy consumption and the separation efficiency. For the first time we have shown the interest of five aspects by considering them simultaneously (1) the pre-concentration column has been included and (2) there is no need to set a distillate composition constraint (like being at the azeotropic composition) in the pre-concentration column. (3) The operating pressure should be lower than 1 atm because it enhances the relative volatility for 1.0-1a class system. (4) A closed loop optimization must be run, to handle the effect of impurity in the entrainer recycle since too much impurity limits the main product recovery and purity from the extractive column. (5) All three columns process must be optimized together rather than sequentially and with multiple objectives. The studied system belongs to class 1.0-1a and the impurity of the recycled entrainer has strong effect on the purity of acetonitrile product. Overall, 17 variables are optimized; column trays, all feed locations, refluxes, entrainer flow rate and all distillate products; under purity constraints for the acetonitrile and water product and for the entrainer recycle impurity. Among nearly 400 designs satisfying the purity specifications, the design case 3 shows an energy consumption and TAC reduced by more than 20% than a literature reference case, thanks to smaller entrainer flow rate, a reduction of 32 trays and lower operating pressures. The best design is a trade-off between first a feasibility governed by thermodynamics through composition profiles and relative volatility maps and second process cost and energy demands.

AB A photocatalytic reactor using an ozone-generating mercury vapor lamp with the capability to simultaneously utilize the ozone internally generated from the lamp was fabricated. The reactor included a microbubble-generating mechanism to facilitate the dissolution of ozone and oxygen in the reaction liquid. Photocatalytic and photolytic degradation were investigated using two types of mercury vapor lamps: an ozone-generating lamp emitting at both 254 nm and 185 nm as well as a germicidal lamp emitting only at 254 nm. The roles of ozone, 254 nm light and 185 nm light under the degradation of methyl orange were investigated.
   In particular, the mineralization of methyl orange in different processes, namely pure ozonation, photolysis under an ozone-generating lamp with or without the assistance of ozone, photolysis under a germicidal lamp, TiO2 photocatalysis under an ozone-generating lamp with or without the assistance of ozone and TiO2 photocatalysis under a germicidal lamp, were analyzed with the chemical oxygen demand and UV-visible absorption measurements.

AB The diffusion-driven evaporation of sessile droplets from planar surfaces is influenced by cooling at the air-liquid interface. Here, corrections to the available models for predicting the evaporation process are presented. The mass conservation for diffusion-driven evaporation is resolved by considering the effect of interface cooling on the change in density of saturated vapour along the liquid-vapour interface of sessile droplets. Corrections to the predictions for the spatial distribution of vapour density around a sessile droplet and the evaporative flux of vapour at the interface are obtained. The classical models are recovered from the new predictions if interface cooling is negligible. Comparison between the new and classical predictions for the local surface evaporative flux is obtained using the literature data. Our analysis shows a significant effect of interface cooling which should be considered in predicting diffusion-driven evaporation of sessile droplets on planar surfaces. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Pinch-off of liquid bridge during droplet coalescence under constrained
   condition
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE

DE Pinch-off; Liquid bridge; Droplet coalescence; Constrained condition
ID SESSILE DROPLETS; SURFACE; STABILITY; SINGLE; LAW
AB In this study, we perform an experimental investigation on the dynamical behaviors of a liquid bridge formed during droplet coalescence. Notably, the two droplets are constrained respectively by two vertically aligned needles. Of particular interest is the pinch-off of the liquid bridge under this constrained condition. We observe three typical behaviors of the liquid bridge: (1) reaching a stable shape after damped oscillations (regime I); (2) pinching off at both sides in the first necking stage with the largest oscillation amplitude (regime II); and (3) pinching off at only the upper side after once or twice necking (regime III). To indicate the condition when the pinch-off of the liquid bridge may occur, we develop a phase diagram based on the radius ratio of the droplet to the needle R-d/R-n and the Bond number Bo, which respectively characterizes the relative importance of surface tension to the constraint force from needles and that of gravity to surface tension. In general, the dynamical behavior of the liquid bridge transitions from regime II to regime I with R-d/R-n decreasing, and the critical value for this transition is 1.6. This transition indicates that the constraint force keeps the liquid bridge stable while the surface tension promotes its instability. Surprisingly, once the Bond number is sufficiently high (e.g., Bo > 0.05), regime III (i.e., pinch-off at only the upper side) is observed when R-d/R-n becomes around the regime II to I transition (i.e., R-d/R-n = 1.6). It is because the effect of gravity becomes predominant over the surface tension and the constrained force from needles. Moreover, we analyze the pinch-off characteristics of the liquid bridge lying in regimes II and III, including its pinch-off time (i.e., the time interval from the formation and pinch-off of the liquid bridge) and its neck shape at the instant of pinching off.

AB Silica based crack-free monoliths having the same pore size range as the oil and gas producing north-american shales were synthesized using a new synthesis procedure. Crack-free monoliths were synthesized by controlling the evaporation rate. Evaporation rate of 0.4 g/cm(2) was found optimal for making monoliths in cylindrical enclosures of different sizes for experimentation. The focus of this work was to understand the effects of nano-sized porous media on the saturation pressures of a hydrocarbon mixture of methane and decane. The physicochemical properties of the synthesized monoliths were measured using X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm (BET), pore size distribution curve, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of decane in saturated monoliths revealed different boiling points in comparison to pure decane. The experimentally measured saturation pressures at two different temperatures of the bulk hydrocarbon mixture (decane-methane) matched well with the simulated results. The bubble point pressures of a hydrocarbon mixture in the nano-sized monolith were lower (about 18%) than those in the bulk. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A deterministic modelling approach is developed to predict the internal structure of gradient copolymer chains. A key innovation of the modelling approach is the introduction of a positional variable that gives direct access to quantitative gradient characteristics: the ensemble average composition and the gradient deviation. This positional variable is used to develop multi-dimensional population balance equations that can be solved numerically to calculate gradient quality measures. The methodology is illustrated using the gradient copolymerisation of ethylene and 1-octene via coordinative chain transfer mechanism, which is representative of a variety of polymerisation schemes for gradient copolymers. Simulation results are validated with those obtained by stochastic simulations which, until now, were the only means of predicting detailed gradient quality. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

AB Fouling is a ubiquitous problem in the food industry yet details are scarce on how such deposits grow with time to unsustainable levels; processes have to be stopped and equipment cleaned, both at a great cost. Proper understanding of fouling rates, through mechanistic models, would help developing strategies to minimize fouling. In this study, we consider the deposition over stainless steel similar to 316 of whey proteins as a model fouling material in the dairy industry. Fouling rates were determined using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) at 55-65 degrees C for >2 h. The key parameter studied is the effect of the calcium concentration, largely uncontrolled in the past but which recent studies suggest to be as important as temperature. The present QCM-D results confirm and detail the great enhancement effect of calcium in whey fouling, even at the low temperatures tested, increasing the fouling rates by more than hundred times at free calcium concentrations of 40-80 mg/L.

AB Fischer-Tropsch synthesis performance in vertical, inclined and oscillating trickle-bed reactors for offshore floating applications was examined via a complex dynamic three-dimensional multiphase model based on volume-averaged mass, momentum, and species balance equations in liquid and gas phases and simultaneous diffusion and chemical reactions within the catalyst. Angular sinusoidal oscillatory motion of the trickle-bed reactor between vertical and an inclined position and between two inclined symmetrical/asymmetrical positions was examined. The behavior of inclined and oscillating Fischer-Tropsch trickle-bed reactors is atypical because the reactants in the main reactions originate from the gas phase and because a fraction of useful CO can be redirected in water gas-shift reaction. The performance of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis in the presence of water-gas shift reaction increases slightly with amplification of packed bed inclination even if the distortion of axial symmetry of liquid holdup and axial velocity radial distributions becomes considerable. Also, in asymmetric oscillating trickle-bed reactors the performance of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is slightly improved. This enhancement is maximal for the reactor moving between vertical and an inclined position when the time-dependent waves of CO and H-2 conversion develop around the steady-state solution of the middle inclination angle. The oscillatory Fischer-Tropsch performance moves towards the steady-state solution of the vertical state when the asymmetry between two inclined positions diminishes. Symmetric oscillating trickle-bed reactors generate an oscillatory Fischer-Tropsch performance around the steady-state solution of vertical state which is affected by the angular motion parameters of the reactor.

AB The influence of the bubble diameter on the mass transfer coefficient and the reaction selectivity of a competitive-consecutive mechanism has been investigated by means of 3D Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of reactive mass transfer from deformable single bubbles. In order to assess the sensitivity of the transfer processes with respect to the chemical time scales, different chemical reaction intensities have been considered, covering the range from slow to fast reactions. Simulations have been performed using an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) Interface-Tracking algorithm, allowing for highly accurate hydrodynamic and reactive mass transfer results.
   With the concentration boundary layers being significantly thinner than the hydrodynamic boundary layer at the bubble interfaces, a two-mesh approach with a specialised refinement strategy has been adopted. In this approach, the reactive processes are numerically solved by using a second mesh with additional cell layers at the interface, alleviating the multiscale problem but keeping the computational costs reasonable.
   In the bubble diameter range investigated in this work, significant changes of the mass transfer coefficient and the reaction selectivity have been observed and discussed. Furthermore, the simulation results have been used to assess the validity of the film theory, also for technically relevant bubble sizes and reaction conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the computational modeling of two-phase flow, many uncertainties are usually faced in simulations and validations with experiments. This has traditionally made it difficult to provide a general method to predict the two-phase flow characteristics for any geometry and condition, even for bubbly flow regimes. Thus, we focus our research on studying in depth the bubbly flow modeling and validation from a critical point of view. The conditions are intentionally limited to scenarios where coalescence and breakup can be neglected, to concentrate on the study of bubble dynamics and its interaction with the main fluid. This study required the development of a solver for bubbly flow with higher resolution level than TFM and a new methodology to obtain the data from the simulation. In Part II, taking profit of the detailed data provided by the CFD-DEM solver presented in Part I, we propose a novel methodology based on virtual sensor probes, to perform a rigorous validation and to investigate the experimental data. The same approximation used for processing the experimental datasets applies to simulation data, then the same assumptions are considered. In this way we can study an extended number of disperse phase variables as bubble velocity, void fraction, interfacial area concentration, mean chord length and distribution, Sauter mean diameter, bubble frequency and missing ratio, in addition to other variables as bubble size distribution or carrier phase velocity and turbulence. Several upward bubbly flow scenarios from datasets of different authors are used to validate the solver using this methodology. Finally, an axial evolution validation is performed including a discussion motivated by the comparison between experiments and the data from the virtual probes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this work, the phase equilibria of the system comprised of isophorone, furfural, water and acetic acid were studied from the viewpoint of the extraction process. Equilibrium vapor pressure of pure isophorone was measured at sub-atmospheric pressure. Isobaric (at 40 kPa) isophorone-furfural vapor-liquid equilibria, the excess enthalpy of isophorone-furfural mixture (at 323 K) and isophorone-acetic acid vapor-liquid equilibria (from 322 K to 342 K) were investigated and compared to the available literature data. Liquid-liquid equilibria of systems comprised of isophorone-furfural-water (from 303 K to 343 K) were measured for the first time. The experimental results of this study and the literature values were utilized for optimizing the parameters for UNIQUAC model. The model was validated against the measured liquid-liquid equilibrium of the quaternary system isophorone-furfural-acetic acid-water (from 298 K to 343 K). Isophorone was found to be a favorable solvent for furfural extraction from its aqueous solutions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In contrast to typical applications of the pseudopotential Lattice Boltzmann model to two components, quantitative validations and applications for three-component Shan-Chen model are performed here. First, the qualitative and quantitative validations for the following three cases were performed, i.e., three-phase separation, meniscus-induced bubble movement, and the three-phase layered flow. A scheme to control the simulated contact angle of droplets on the interface is provided for the three fluid phase Lattice Boltzmann model. The effects of droplet shape, the strength of gravity, droplet size, and meniscus curvature for the spontaneous motion of droplets and bubbles are investigated in detail. It is found that without gravity, droplets tend to move to the wall on a concave upwards meniscus when they have a big "head" and a small "belly". Gravity may enhance rather than inhibit the motion towards the wall when the density of the droplet or bubble is relatively small. Finally, smaller droplet size and larger meniscus curvatures enhance the spontaneous movement towards a wall. The conclusions are relevant to practical applications such as water treatment, oil spill remediation, and droplet-based microfluidics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It is known that the fluid dynamics and transport phenomena in bubble columns depend mainly on the bubble column design (i.e., the column diameter, aspect ratio, and gas sparger openings) and the liquid phase properties. In this communication, we contribute to present-day discussion through an experimental study concerning the combined effects of the gas sparger design and liquid phase properties on both the gas holdup and the main flow regime transition. The experimental study concerning gas holdup measurements was conducted in a large-diameter and large-scale bubble column (with a height of 5.3 m and inner diameter of 0.24 m) operated in the batch mode. Air was used as the dispersed phase (using gas superficial velocities in the range 0.004-0.20 m/s), and various water-monoethylene glycol (MEG) solutions were employed as binary liquid phases. The water-MEG solutions tested have viscosities between 0.9 mPa.s and 7.97 mPa.s, densities between 997.086 kg/m(3) and 1094.801 kg/m(3), and surface tension between 0.0715 N/m and 0.0502 N/m. Two gas spargers were tested: (a) a spider sparger ("coarse gas sparger") and (b) a needle sparger ("fine gas sparger"). The former produced a poly-dispersed homogeneous flow regime resulting in a concave gas holdup curve, whereas the latter produced a mono-dispersed homogeneous flow regime resulting in an S-shaped gas holdup curve. It was observed that the mono-dispersed bubble size distribution stabilized the homogeneous flow regime. The addition of MEG produced different effects depending on the gas sparger design. The addition of MEG in the "coarse gas sparger" configuration produced what is usually referred to as "dual effect of viscosity": depending on the MEG concentration, the homogeneous flow regime was stabilized/destabilized, and thus, the gas holdup increased/decreased. Conversely, the addition of MEG in the "fine gas sparger" changed the shape of the gas holdup curve from an S-shape to concave, thus rendering it similar to the ones produced by "coarse gas sparger". We speculate that viscous solutions reduce the influence of the inlet conditions in large-diameter and large-scale bubble columns; this is a matter of future research. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper provides experimental evidence supporting the idea that the transition to turbulent flow is governed by the ratio of the specific power input (SPI) and the term G/lambda, where G is the viscoelastic modulus of the liquid and lambda is the relaxation time, in a vessel containing a fluid agitated by sparged gas (air) at low superficial gas velocities. This finding provides a method for judging the flow regime within a vessel a priori using a nondimensional quantity and can be used as a scale for decision-making in cases where real-time visual analysis is not possible. While the work reported below is motivated by anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge, the results are obtained using model liquids and should, therefore, have wide application in chemical process engineering, such as CFD simulation of mixing in viscoelastic fluids and mixing in fermentation processes.

AB Turbulent convective heat transfers of Al2O3-water nanofluid flowing in a circular tube subjected to an uniform wall heat flux are numerically investigated using different turbulence models. Four nanoparticle volume concentrations phi up to 2% are considered for bulk Reynolds numbers within the range 3000 <= Re <= 20, 000. The effects of the nanoparticle concentration and the Reynolds number on the Nusselt number and friction factor are reported. Two different numerical approaches including the single-phase and the mixture two-phase models with variable thermophysical properties are favorably compared to experimental results obtained from the literature for low nanoparticle concentrations (phi <= 0.5%). The results at a higher volume fraction phi = 2% show the necessity to use a mixture model. Eight turbulence models in their low-Reynolds number formulation are also compared to assess their ability to predict the effect of turbulence on the convective heat transfer. The SST k-omega model was found to perform the best with errors in terms of the average Nusselt number and friction coefficient of 0.44% and 1.82% respectively. On the contrary, the linear pressure-strain Reynolds Stress Model completely failed to provide the good values with discrepancies of 41.91% and 133.54%, respectively. Finally, the benefit of using this nanofluid is discussed regarding four merit criteria. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The hydrothermal stability of Cu/SAPO-34 catalysts under different treatment time (3 h, 6 h, 12 h) at 950 degrees C has been investigated to understand their framework collapse and deactivation mechanism for NO reduction by ammonia selective catalytic reduction (NH3-SCR). It was seen that SCR activities declined dramatically after 12 h aging, and XRD results showed this treatment led to crystallinity decline since 3 h. Furthermore, zeolites crystal started to transform into SiO2 and AlPO4 phase since 6 h. NMR results further proved the formation of SiO2 and AlPO4 center dot NH3-TPD and ex-situ DRIFTS results revealed the breakage of Si-OH-Al bonds and the decline of the number of Bronsted acid sites, meanwhile, H-2-TPR and EPR results proved that the number of Cu2+ species decreased and the location of Cu2+ species changed after this treatment, which were mainly responsible for declined SCR reaction rates.

AB Graphite oxide (GO) is one of the most extensively studied materials and has been tested for numerous applications due to its unique properties. Nevertheless, a quantitative description of complicated transfer and reaction rates of the oxidation of graphite is still not available, which essentially hinders large-scale production of high-quality GO and other graphene related materials. In this work, GO is prepared from flake graphite (FG) by a modified Hummers method. Size and color evolutions of time-dependent complementary domains, i.e. the starting GO domain and the remaining FG domain, are monitored during the entire oxidation process. The oxidation of FG in acidic oxidizing medium can be interpreted as a contracting area process controlled by phase boundary. Reaction rate constant (k) and kinetic parameters (Ea, lnA) are obtained after a systematic investigation of the influence of reaction temperature, concentration of sulfuric acid, and oxidizing agent on the oxidation, with the aid of R2 mathematical model. Using the kinetic results, the oxidation process and the conversion rate from FG to GO thus become controllable. Both intermediate products and final GO products are studied using XRD, TGA, and XPS to reveal the oxidation mechanism. The degree of oxidation of FG and the content of major functional groups on the surface of products can thus be optimized. Our research results are valuable to understanding fundamental mechanism of graphite oxidation and to achieving industrial production of high-quality GO with controllable degree of oxidation and tunable proportion of oxygen-containing functional groups for a variety of applications.

AB Enzymatic chain-end depolymerization is commonly employed for the transformation of biomass into important products. To date, investigation on the validity of the rate kernel which is critical to model success, has been conveniently avoided. Through a case study with extensive confrontation with experimental data, we uncover this critical relationship by inspecting every minute detail in the mechanistic modelling procedure. Using a newly proposed shape-evolving function for the rate kernel, model calibration reveals that the commonly employed constant rate kernel is inappropriate for modelling the scission step, and that the apparent rate kernel of hydrolysis resembles an endothermic activation energy barrier function. Facilitated by the adoption of this non-classical rate kernel, good predictions are attained by the model at different hydrolysis conditions with a global parameter set. Being the first to predict distributed data, the methodology here serves as a guide for future studies on the enzymatic disruption of polymeric biomass, i.e. for guiding substrate and enzyme structure modifications.

AB This study focuses on the macroscopic characteristics of the turbulent flow in a vessel equipped with a newly developed long-short blades (LSB) agitator. After validation by PIV experiments, the LES method using dynamic kinetic energy sub-grid scale model, coupled with sliding mesh approach, was used to investigate the flow patterns, the axial and radial flow rates, turbulent dynamic energy distribution, and the power number in the vessel with the LSB agitator at the liquid height, H/T = 1.0 and 1.5, respectively. It is found that the turbulent characteristics are substantially different from those of the conventional agitators. The short blades of the LSB agitator generate a strong axial up-flow in the center, which interacts with the dominant radial motion of the long blades, leading to formation of multiple vortexes along the axis. The direction of the flow in the vortex above the short blades is opposite to that below the short blades, which is completely different from the classical Rushton turbine. Effective mass exchange between the axial and radial flows occurs nearly in the entire vessel. Compared with the conventional agitators, the LSB agitator can achieve high mixing performance and much better homogeneity in the distribution of the turbulent kinetic energy. The effect of the liquid height on the power number and the specific power consumption was also discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A swelling-dependent two-fluid model (STFM) is developed for the liquid-solid flows of swelling particles in polyethylene reactors. The model integrates the two-fluid model (TFM) with a species transport equation (STE) to account for the diffusion of alkane molecules from the liquid bulk to the amorphous region of particles, and a population balance equation (PBE) to consider the aggregation of swelling particles. Simulations show that only the TFM fails to capture the main features of swelling systems. By contrast, the STFM captures the gradual increase of power consumption due to particle swelling and aggregation, which agrees with the experiments in a stirred tank. The STFM predicts also the slug formation and a sharp increase of power consumption in a slurry loop reactor as well as the solid accumulation behind pump. The difference of model prediction for stirred tanks and loop reactors suggests the potential of reactor optimization by enhancing local mixing while still keeping high solid concentration for productivity.

AB Photocuring of multi-functional acrylate films for applications in large scale prints and 3D objects is a radical polymerization process under seriously changing conditions of liquid monomer to solid polymer network. Although a model is available describing this process and experimental data have been obtained for photocuring of hexanediol diacrylate (HDDA), measurements with widely varying light intensity to estimate the kinetic parameters in the model were still lacking. We have carried out such measurements with the aim of generating a proper set of parameters for the model, which then may be used for process optimization. We present results of the curing of thin HDDA films (10 mu m) with initiator Irgacure 819, bis (acylphosphine oxide) under irradiation intensity varying in a range of 2-1350 W.m(2). Average conversion of vinyl groups in the films was registered by Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) in transmission mode. A remarkable insensitivity of end conversion (range 78-85%) to light intensity was observed, but conversion rate varied strongly (0.1-6 s(1)). Despite the large difference in irradiation and associated macroradical concentration level, a surprising similarity in the shapes of the conversion rate was observed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Process scale-up is a critical factor for realizing the industrial-scale production of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). To improve the efficiency of scale-up, a strategy based on computational fluid dynamics analysis and investigation of microbial physiological properties was developed. We first investigated the physiological response of Schizochytrium sp. to different scale bioreactors, and the results indicated that a homogeneous culture environment was beneficial for cell growth and DHA biosynthesis. Fluid dynamics of different scale bioreactors were further investigated and impeller combinations were designed and optimized by computational methods to obtain a homogeneous culture environmental in a 7000 L bioreactor. The results showed that the optimal impeller combination could provide a more balanced culture environment, similar to lab-scale bioreactors. When the optimal strategy was used to scale-up the DHA fermentation, the biomass, DHA concentration, DHA percentage in biomass and DHA productivity reached 128.3 g/L, 39.2 g/L, 30.5%, 326.5 mg/(L h), respectively. This study thus introduces a highly efficient and economical scale-up strategy for DHA production using Schizochytrium sp. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Observations of an enhanced mass transfer and an irregular mixing when a small drop of dye is gently placed on a nanofluid dispersion have led to several propositions for the underlying cause, but none of them have been conclusively established. Here, we reproduce the enhancement phenomenon within a glass capillary containing fluorescein di-sodium dye solution on one side and alumina nanoparticle suspension on the other, avoiding the inertial interference present earlier. The enhancement is explained by the convective motion (and not a diffusion) of the dye solution counter to the direction of the diffusiophoretic motion of the nanoparticles towards a higher concentration of the dye. The initial velocity of the dye front in the capillary and the dye-drop experiment agree quantitatively with independent theoretical estimates from the diffusiophoretic velocity of alumina nanoparticles. With a suitably chosen nanofluid, it should now be possible to effect a desired level of enhancement (or suppression) of mass transfer of any solute. In micro-environments requiring fast mixing, such as in nanofabrication, lab-on-chip, drug-delivery, and chemotaxis, the effects can be substantial. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, an efficient ghost-cell based immersed boundary method is introduced to perform direct numerical simulation (DNS) of mass transfer problems in particulate flows. The fluid-solid coupling is achieved by implicit incorporation of the boundary conditions into the discretized momentum and species conservation equations of the fluid phase. Taking the advantage of a second order quadratic interpolation scheme utilized in the reconstruction procedures, the unique feature of this ghost-cell based immersed boundary method is its capability to handle mixed boundary conditions at the exact position of the particle surface as encountered in systems with interplay between surface reactions and diffusion.
   A fixed Eulerian grid is used to solve the conservation equations for the entire computational domain. Following a detailed verification of the method in the limiting case of unsteady molecular diffusion without convection, we apply our method to study fluid-particle mass transfer for flow around a single sphere and a dense stationary array consisting of hundreds of spheres over a range of Damkohler numbers.

AB In this work, we describe a theoretical model for the simulation of reactive foaming of polyurethane (PU) consisting of three parts - reaction kinetics, foam expansion and wall evolution, which are coupled together. The advantage of this approach is that it provides comprehensive details about the development of PU foam - from the evolution of temperature and foam density to morphology features like bubble size, wall thickness and strut shape at the same time. The performance of the model is evaluated by analysing the model predictions for realistic process conditions and comparing to experimental data. It is demonstrated that the increased viscosity of the reaction mixture will lead to foams with thicker walls. The presented model can serve as a useful tool for the optimization of PU foaming process. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In droplet-based microfluidic systems, microchannel design plays a primary role in transport and manipulation of liquid droplets. The objective of this paper is to investigate dynamics of a droplet in planar contraction microchannel via three-dimensional numerical simulation and theoretical analysis. In particular, this study characterizes three regimes of the droplet dynamics, namely, trap, squeeze and breakup, depending on capillary number (Ca) and contraction ratio (C). In addition, theoretical models have been proposed to describe transitions from one to another regime as a function of Ca and C. For the transition from trap to squeeze, the critical capillary number (Ca-Ic) was found to follow Ca-Ic = a(C-M - 1), whereas the critical capillary number (Ca-IIc) of transition from squeeze to breakup corresponds to Ca-IIc = c(1)C (1). Furthermore, details of the droplet dynamics along downstream of the contraction have been explored as well to depict deformation, retraction and/or breakup of the droplet. The present results would be useful guidelines in designing contraction microfluidic channel for precise control and manipulation of droplets. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The breakup dynamics of the dispersed thread for droplet formation in shear-thinning fluids in a flow-focusing device was highlighted. The breakup process of the shear-thinning dispersed thread could be divided into four stages: the droplet growth stage and the squeezing stage, both of them are dominated by the squeezing pressure, the stretching stage controlled by the viscous stresses of dispersed phase and the surface tension, and the pinch-off stage controlled by the viscous stresses of both phases and the surface tension. The breakup dynamics of the dispersed thread for the shear-thinning fluids in each stage is very similar to that of the constant viscosity Newtonian liquids, signifying that the breakup is almost unaffected by the shear-thinning rheological properties.

AB The present work is on comparison of numerical-methodology as well as performance of the two types of level set methods (LSMs): sharp-interface and diffused-interface. The numerical-methodology along with mathematical-formulation are presented in-detail for relatively recent ghost fluid method based sharp-interface level-set-method (SI-LSM); and compared with the methodology for the traditional diffuse-interface level-set-method (DI-LSM) as well as an improved diffuse-interface dual-grid-level-set-method (DI-DGLSM). Two different types of surface models are considered: continuum surface force (CSF) and sharp surface force (SSF) model; CSF model for the DI-LSM and SSF model for the SI-LSM. The SI-LSM considers the physically realistic sudden variation of the thermo-physical property across the sharp-interface while DI-LSM considers a smoothened value of the properties across the numerically diffused-interface. For solving the pressure Poisson equation in the SI-LSM, a finite volume method based generic formulation is proposed and its implementation-details are presented. For the SI-LSM as compared to DI-LSM and DI-DGLSM, the relative performance study is presented on four reasonably different two-phase problems: surface-tension model induced unphysical flow for a static water droplet, collapse of a water-column in air, falling of a water-droplet in air, and coalescence of an ethanol-droplet over a pool of ethanol in air. For the performance study on various problems, a comparison of the results obtained by the three types of LSMs (SI-LSM, DI-LSM and DI-DGLSM) and various other numerical methods in the literature are presented. SI-LSM as compared to DI-LSM and DI-DGLSM is shown to substantially reduce the unphysical spurious velocity and results in better accuracy on the same grid size. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Numbering-up using parallel channels helps to achieve higher processing capacity while retaining the advantages of microreactors. However it may also lead to non-uniformity in flow across all the channels. Here we report the CFD simulations and experimental observations on the extent of uniformity in the flow from an assembly of several parallel channels. In the conventional parallel channel geometry, smaller channel size (<300 m) as well as higher fluid viscosity is seen to give better flow uniformity. Inequality in pressure distribution at the inlet of a large number of parallel channels is overcome by having two 'pressure equalization slots' at an equal distance from inlet and outlets that open in the respective manifolds. Having such an arrangement helped to reduce the standard deviation in the flow by almost 90% when compared to the conventional geometry. However the modification was seen to increase the extent of back mixing to some extent. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chemical vapour infiltration (CVI) is widely used for fabricating carbon fibre-reinforced carbon materials for aircraft brake disks. This study aims at developing a numerical simulation method for predicting densification of the material during the CVI. Based on the multi-step reaction and deposition models, including the hydrogen inhibition model of pyrocarbon growth, transient 3D simulations of the CVI using methane as a precursor of the pyrocarbon were carried out via the finite element method coupling the mass transfer (by convection and diffusion) and the evolutive porous structure model with gas-phase and surface chemical reactions. The CVI of two different types of preforms was studied. The pore structure evolution models were derived not analytically but numerically with the aid of a computational tool for visualizing the fibre structures. An acceptable agreement was found between the predicted densification profiles and the experimental data obtained using a laboratory CVI reactor at a temperature of 1343 K, a methane pressure of 30 kPa and a total deposition time of 120 h.

AB The influence of applied mixing (intensity and duration), solids concentration, and liquor chemistry on the molecular weight (MW) response of seven anionic (30%) polyacrylamides was investigated in the flocculation of standard kaolin slurry at pH 8. Continuous flocculation was achieved in a Couette mixing device (CSIRO Shear Vessel) with a vertical flow-through arrangement allowing operator-independent settling rate measurements to be made under tightly controlled mixing conditions. It was found that the relative performance of the flocculants was strongly dependent on the hydrodynamic conditions prevailing during flocculation. The lower MWs gave a more dosage-effective response under mild mixing, producing denser, faster-settling aggregates than equivalent sizes produced with the higher MWs. Conversely, the larger sizes created by the higher MWs gave access to faster settling rates under intense mixing, except in the instance where polymer size and concentration led to chain entanglements. Sodium cations (<0.01 M) in the slurry favoured some degree of particle coagulation, whereas calcium cations had an adverse effect on settling rates even at low concentrations (<0.002 M), with the effects of a reduced bridging capacity most apparent in the lower MWs. The results advance the fundamental understanding of how chain length can substantially alter inter-particle bridging behaviour under different conditions, and thus provide a more robust basis for enhanced dewatering of clay suspensions through flocculant MW selection.

AB Drop formation in a microfluidic flow-focusing device (cross-junction) was studied in absence and presence of one of two ionic surfactants. Four different flow regimes: squeezing, dripping, jetting, and threading were observed in line with existing literature. The effect of surfactant on the transition between flow regimes was shown to depend upon the value of critical micelle concentration and correlates with dynamic surface tension. Drop length in the channel increased as the ratio of flow rate of dispersed to continuous phase, phi, increased. For drops smaller than the channel width, the increase was slow, proportional to phi(0.1), yet was much faster, proportional to phi, for larger drops. In contradiction to the expected stabilisation of drops by surfactant, surfactant-laden drops larger than the channel height coalesced inside the channel at a higher rate than surfactant-free drops. It is proposed that the coalescence is caused by the electrostatic attraction due to surfactant redistribution under the high shear stresses near the wall of the channel. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB In preparative protein chromatography, broad dynamic ranges of protein concentrations as well as coelution of product and impurities are common. Despite being the standard in biopharmaceutical production, monitoring of preparative chromatography is generally limited to surrogate signals, e.g. UV absorbance at 280 nm. To address this problem, variable pathlength (VP) spectroscopy in conjunction with Partial Least Squares regression (PLS) was used to monitor preparative chromatography. While VP spectroscopy enabled the acquisition of absorbance data for a broad concentration range, PLS modelling allowed for the differentiation between the protein species. The approach was first implemented for monitoring the separation of lysozyme from cytochrome c at an overall loading density of 92 g/l. The same method was then applied to the polishing step of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) at 40 g/l loading density. For PLS model prediction of the mAb monomer and the high molecular weight variants (HMWs), the root mean square error (RMSE) was 1.07 g/l and 0.42 g/l respectively. To demonstrate the usability of the approach for in-line control, pooling decisions for both separation problems were subsequently taken based on the computed concentrations or thereof derived purities. In summary, VP spectroscopy in conjunction with PLS modelling is a promising option for in-line monitoring and control of future chromatography steps at large scale. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB In this paper, a mathematical model has been developed to analyze the fluid flow and heat transfer effect in a hydrophobic microchannel filled with a power law fluid. The effects of Joule heating, thermal radiation and velocity slip boundary conditions are analyzed by considering different slip parameters, EDL thickness, pressure gradient and flow behavior indices. The analytical expression for fluid flow and heat transfer have been derived in terms of the flow governing parameters based on the Debye-Huckel linearizing principle. Depending on the experimental existing flow behavior index, the analytical solutions are obtained in closed form where as numerical results are presented for general parametric values. The impact of slip velocity parameters in terms of a flow enhancement factor (E-fb), is studied to obtain the average flow velocity variation in a hydrophobic microchannel compared to a plane microchannel. The pressure assisted flow for pseudo-plastic (shear thinning) fluids achieve maximum velocity as compared to dilatant (shear thickening) fluids. The study finds that increase in thermal radiation minimizes heat transfer rate close to the hydrophobic wall, plays a vital role for the therapeutic treatment of hyperthermia (to understand the effect of heat transfer due to electric potential). It is also observed that Joule heating parameters enhance the heat transfer rate for classical Newtonian/non-Newtonian fluids for decrease in power indices and pressure gradient.

AB Rapid and efficient mixing is crucial in microfluidic devices. The two-phase hydrodynamic focusing has already been shown to be a flexible method of micromixing. In this method, the sample stream composed of solute and solvent is squeezed between two sheath flows of a highly viscous fluid so as to reduce the diffusion path. The main challenge in modeling the associated transport phenomena is the difference between the viscosities and diffusivities of the sample and sheath flows. In this paper, 3D analytical solutions are presented for solute transport in two-phase focusing micromixers, regarding the sample and sheath flows as a single domain of variable physical properties. The model is shown to be able to capture the change of the concentration gradient at the sample/sheath interfaces. The results demonstrate that the mixing length can be reduced significantly by employing more viscous sheath flows while even having more values of efficiency, defined as the ratio of the solutes remaining in the sample flow to the total solutes. Although smaller mixing lengths may also be obtained by increasing the sheath flow rate in single-phase focusing, it is accompanied by sever reductions in efficiency, revealing that the single-phase focusing is not an efficient mixing tool.

AB Grid based fluid simulation methods are not able to solve complex non-linear dynamics like the rupture of a dynamic liquid bridge between freely colliding solids-an exemplary scenario of capillary forces competing with inertial forces in engineering applications-using a monolithic formulation for the solid and liquid phases present. We introduce a new Incompressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method for simulating three dimensional fluid-solid interaction flows with capillary (wetting and surface tension) effects at free surfaces. This meshless approach presents significant advantages over grid based approaches in terms of being monolithic and in handling interaction with free solids. The method is validated for accuracy and stability in dynamic scenarios involving surface tension and wetting. We then present three dimensional simulations of crown forming instability following the splash of a liquid drop, and the rupture of a liquid bridge between two colliding solid spheres, to show the method's advantages in the study of dynamic micromechanical phenomena involving capillary flows.

AB Wettability has significant influence on fluid flow inside foam ceramics. Foam SiC valves with various wettability were prepared by a facial bottom-up strategy. Subsequently, pressure drop, weeping and gas distribution were studied. Results indicate that pressure drop decreases remarkably with increasing contact angle (CA), 43% at most; weeping rate presents a peak at CA<90 degrees but monotonous decrease at CA>90 degrees; gas distribution becomes more uniform with increasing CA at small F-factor but presents obvious boundary effect at large F-factor. To illustrate the CA effect, we propose a new strategy for pressure drop decomposition, introducing the fourth part called CA-induced pressure drop by modifying classical three-component strategy, which also catalyzes a new pressure drop measuring strategy. In the meanwhile, the mathematical model to predict pressure drop is proposed and shows good agreement with experiments. Moreover, process model to illustrate the mechanism is proposed based on interfacial phenomena, force analysis and flow patterns. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Experiments have been carried out to determine the minimum fluidization velocity for sand particles of irregular shape and size using pseudoplastic liquids in different Perspex columns. The effect of different operating parameters, like column diameter, particle size and shape, rheological properties of the liquid on minimum fluidization velocity has been investigated. It has been observed that as sphericity of the particle decreases, minimum fluidization also decreases. Empirical correlation has been developed to predict the minimum fluidization velocity as a function of physical and dynamic variable of the system. Statistical analysis of the correlation suggests that is of acceptable accuracy. Applicability of the artificial neural network modelling using gradient descent and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm have also been successfully tested. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A numerical model has been developed for struvite-crystallization in a fluidized bed reactor (FBR). For the first time, the flow field and crystal size distribution (CSD) are simultaneously obtained via solving the model that couples computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and population balance equation (PBE). The model was first verified based on the experimental data, and used to explore the influences of operating conditions and reactor geometry. The results showed that the predictions were in good agreement with the experimental observations, giving similar phosphorus removal trend. The predicted supersaturation levels, solid concentrations, and CSDs were found to be strongly dependent on the recycle ratio, pH, and inflow rate. Moreover, the split module was considered better as compared with the traditional integrated module in terms of the supersaturation control. The proposed CFD-PBE modeling framework is thus considered to be a useful tool for performance evaluation and geometry optimization of struvite crystallization. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The formation mechanisms of S/W/O compound droplets in a horizontal T-junction device was investigated. According to the capillary number, C-a, of a continuous phase and the ratio, R, given by R = Q(main)/Q(side), the formation mechanisms which are the double-encapsulation, squeezing regime, dripping-like regime, and the jetting-like regime can be distinguished. In the squeezing regime, the lag of the PS shell relative to the W phase results in a different squeezing stage, in which the neck thickness decreases firstly and then increases because of the limited deformation of the W/O interface by the PS shell. After the PS shell totally intrudes into the main channel, the neck thickness decreases again. In the dripping-like regime, the gap distance decreases linearly with the entry of the PS shell into the main channel. Therefore, compared with W/O droplets in dripping regime, the dominant force that breaks off the neck remains to be the pressure drop force, and not the shearing force, because of the comparatively large diameter of the PS shell to that of the channel. A high C-a and low R contribute to the formation of the jetting-like regime, in which the inertia force and shearing force contribute to the formation of a long tip because of the large flow rates in the main and side channel. In addition, regimes in the flow pattern diagram dependent on C-a and R are obtained. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work focuses on the thermodynamic prediction of solvent effects on the transesterification of butyl acetate with ethanol to butanol and ethyl acetate in the solvent heptane at 293.15 K and 303.15 K. Both, the reaction equilibrium and the reaction kinetics have been investigated experimentally by Schmidt et al. (1999). They found that the solvent heptane does not affect the reaction equilibrium but significantly influences the reaction kinetics. They described the solvent effect on the reaction kinetics by empirically correlating the experimentally-observed apparent rate constants with the dielectric constants of the different reaction mixtures.
   In this work we re-evaluated the experimental data and now present a thermodynamic approach to consistently predict the solvent effect on both, the reaction equilibrium and the reaction kinetics. Accounting for the activity coefficients of the reactants/products obtained from the Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT) allowed for considering the interactions of the reactants/products among themselves and also with the solvent heptane. Accounting for those, it is shown that the solvent effect on the reaction equilibrium as well as on the reaction rate can even be predicted in very good agreement with the experimental data.

AB The effect of Stokes number, Weissenberg number, particle aspect ratio and particle-to-fluid density ratio on the mixing and orientation distributions of cylindrical particles in a mixing layer of an Oldroyd-B fluid is numerically studied using the pseudo-spectral method and Runge-Kutta method. The results show that the particles with annular orbit will rotate around the large vortex center and mix into the core of the vortex, while the particles with wavy orbit do not involve the mixing process. The particles with a small Stokes number are distributed homogenously and mixed thoroughly, whereas the particles with a large Stokes number are poorly mixed and centrifugalized to the edge of the vortex. The range of mixing area is decreased with increasing Stokes number. The initial orientation of the particles has a weak effect on its motion orbit. The roll-up of mixing layer drives the particles to the edge of the vortex, the particle mixing becomes worse with increasing Stokes number and particle aspect ratio, and with decreasing the Weissenberg number. When the Weissenberg number is small, and the Stokes number and particle aspect ratio are large, a little more particles orient towards the vorticity axis. With increasing the Weissenberg number, and decreasing the Stokes number and particle aspect ratio, more particles align themselves on the flow-gradient plane. The Stokes number has a stronger effect on the particle mixing than on the orientation distributions, whereas the particle aspect ratio and particle density have a stronger effect on the orientation distributions than on the particle mixing. The Weissenberg number has a stronger effect on the orientation distributions than the particle aspect ratio and Stokes number. The particles drift along the spanwise direction mostly take place at the initial stage, and both maximum and average drift distance finally reach a stable value. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A sessile droplet excited at a constant frequency exhibits a temporal sequence of interface modes when allowed to evaporate. Evaporation tunes the droplet to resonate at different modes in a descending order. The life of each mode spans over a transition stage from the onset of its own resonance to that of the next lower order mode. Mode lifetime during the evaporation period of any droplet has been found to decrease in a power law fashion both theoretically and experimentally when higher driving frequencies are considered. Such dynamics are driven by both evaporation and interface oscillations, the latter being governed by the dispersion relation of one dimensional capillary wave. The natural excitation of sequential mode resonances in the present case is governed by a tuning parameter. Variation of this parameter by evaporation is analogous to external frequency sweep in non evaporating droplets to detect similar mode resonances. The dynamics of transition stage corresponding to each mode is characterized by a second parameter denoted as mode transition parameter. The transition stage (higher to lower order) is initially fast but slows down close to the resonance of lower order mode. Theoretical expressions of mode lifetimes and the tuning parameter have been derived based on reasonably valid assumption of constant static contact angle (a measure of the contact angle of the unperturbed hypothetical droplet shape in an oscillation cycle). An approximate linear relation has been established between detuning (complement of the tuning parameter) and mode transition parameters which governs the dynamics of the transition stage. The experimental data corresponding to the detuning and mode transition parameters show universal merging for all excitation frequencies. The experimental data also follows the proposed theoretical linear trend but deviates towards the later part of the transition stage. Such deviations have been attributed to neglecting higher order terms and possible viscous damping from boundary layer at the substrate. Even then the universality of mode transition across all frequencies is maintained throughout the evaporative lifetime. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The extended quadrature method of moments (EQMOM) for the solution of population balance equations (PBE) is implemented in the open-source computational fluid dynamic (CFD) toolbox OpenFOAM as part of the OpenQBMM project. The moment inversion procedure was designed (Nguyen et al., 2016) to maximize the number of conserved moments in the transported moment set. The algorithm is implemented in a general structure to allow the addition of other kernel density functions defined on R+, and arbitrary kernels to describe physical phenomena involved in the evolution of the number density function. The implementation is verified with a set of zero-dimensional cases involving aggregation and breakage problems. Comparison to the rigorous solution of the PBE provides validation for these cases. The coupling of the EQMOM procedure with a CFD solver to address aggregation and breakage problems of non-inertial particles is validated against experimental measurements in a Taylor-Couette reactor from the literature.

AB Droplets and rivulets over solid surfaces play an important role in a number of engineering applications. We use a Computational Fluid Dynamics model consisting in a smooth inclined plate to study the effect of the contact angle on the morphology, residence time and mass transfer into liquid rivulets. Measurements of the contact angle-using the sessile drop method-between aqueous monoethanolamine solutions and two commercial surfaces used for gas separation, are introduced as boundary condition. Reducing the contact angle from 60 degrees to 20 degrees flattens the rivulet, increasing the gas-liquid interface area by 85%. The cumulative residence time broadens, with an increase of 12% in s10, and of 37% in s90. There is consequently, a theoretical increase of 68% in the total mass transfer rate. A sensible design of the liquid-solid interaction is therefore crucial to good mass transfer performance. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In spite of intense research on coupled transport phenomena in fluid systems, their rigorous modelling and simulation still remains a challenge, especially if a phase change is involved. In this case, the mathematical description becomes particularly interrelated and complex. In the literature, usually only few selected aspects of such problems are considered, e.g. in isothermal or one-component systems. In this work, a more holistic approach is suggested comprising promising concepts available in the literature. The resulting model and relevant code for the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)-simulation of momentum, total mass, species, and heat transfer in two-phase binary systems are free of any heuristic or empirical parameters and thus are applicable to a wide range of problems. Several one-dimensional simulation cases are considered to provide a first validation of the model. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work mainly focused on the droplet coalescence induced by turbulence. Two kinds of interaction mechanisms between turbulent eddies and droplets were proposed, and the corresponding coalescence model for each mechanism has also been proposed by counting the number of collisions that can lead to coalescence directly. Most of previous coalescence models only considered the contribution of the turbulent eddies of size equal to the size of droplets since the droplet velocity was assumed to be equal to the velocity of turbulent eddies of same size. In contrast, the contribution of multiscale turbulent eddies (i.e. turbulent eddies with various sizes, not just the turbulent eddies of size equal to the size of droplets) to the coalescence of droplets of given sizes was considered in the proposed model. This work also simulated the coalescence in the framework of entire energy spectrum. Simultaneously, the influences of the average collision free path between droplets and turbulent eddies as well as the lifetime of turbulent eddies on the coalescence were considered. Furthermore, this work proposed a novel second-order longitudinal structure function, which showed a good agreement with the results of direct numerical simulation. Finally, the predicted droplet size distributions of the proposed model were in agreement with experimental data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Catalysts consisting of Pd supported on virgin and heat-treated carbon blacks (homemade and commercial), graphites (natural and synthetic) and commercial carbon nanofibers were prepared and tested in the aqueous phase hydrodechlorinaton (HDC) of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) under near ambient conditions (30 degrees C, 1 atm) in order to explore the effect of the support on the catalytic behavior. The homemade graphitized supports were prepared from commercial carbon black (CB) and from a carbon black-like material (CBPE) obtained from pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene. All the catalysts prepared yielded complete 4-CP conversion, although a wide range of activity was observed (10.7-173.5 mmol g(Pd)(1) min (1)). The graphitized carbon black provided the most active catalysts, showing Pd nanoparticles around 3 nm in size and a well-balanced contribution of Pd species (Pdn+/Pd-0 = 0.9). Substantial differences of activity were found between the graphitized and not graphitized supports, even for catalysts with similar Pd nanoparticle size. The higher activity of the catalysts with graphitized supports can be partly associated to a more balanced initial Pdn+ to Pd-0 ratio. Moreover, higher selectivity to hydrogenation products (cyclohexanone) was also achieved with those catalysts due to a higher contribution of the Pd0 species. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In previous work we developed and implemented a sub-grid model for the efficient simulation of heat transfer in gas-particle flows around immersed horizontal cylinders. In this study we apply verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification methods to the developed model to rigorously examine its capabilities and limitations. Numerical verification with small, unit-cell problems shows excellent transient and steady-state behavior. Validation of a bubbling bed and a turbulent bed showed good agreement with high-resolution simulations. To quantify the error of the constitutive model predictions two methods were used to calculate confidence intervals, showing an error of approximately +/- 20%, well within the range of typical Nusselt number approximations. The sub-grid model was applied to a conceptual pilot-scale 1 MWe carbon capture reactor to compare with alternative modeling methods. Results show fair predictions of hydrodynamics, heat transfer, and carbon capture rates with significant savings in computational runtimes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A microreactor was used to oxidize ethanol to valuable products under atmospheric pressure. Nano-sized gold on alumina was used as heterogeneous catalyst in the microreactor. A uniform and stable catalyst coating in the microchannels was achieved by suspension method. The catalyst was characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, nitrogen-physisorption and X-ray diffraction.
   The reaction system was studied by changing the operation conditions, i.e. the residence time and temperature (100-250 degrees C). The product stream was analyzed by on-line gas chromatography. The identified products were acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, diethyl ether and ethylene. The aim of the study was to find out the operation conditions that favored the generation of the desired product. A detailed modelling work was included. A kinetic model was developed for the reaction system. Dynamic mass balancebased generic modelling was applied to estimate the rate parameters. gPROMs ModelBuilder, a highly advanced process modelling tool was used. The obtained selectivity for acetaldehyde formation was around 90% already at low temperatures. The mathematical model described the ethanol conversion and acetaldehyde selectivity very well. The experimental equipment, the catalyst, and the modelling approach are applicable for other gas-phase oxidation studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A 0.9 mm PdCu (69 wt% Pd) membrane prepared by an electroless plating method on a ceramic tubular support was tested in hydrogen sulfide containing streams. H2S/H-2 mixtures with 40 and 100 ppmv of H2S were tested in order to observe the reversibility of sulfur addition. The membrane permselectivity operating in H2S/complex mixtures with around 32 ppmv of H2S in CH4, CO, CO2 and H-2 was also tested. The streams were in-situ produced by Methane Steam Reforming and Methane Catalytic Partial Oxidation reactions. Prior to the tests with H2S, the hydrogen flux of the membrane at 773 K and 2 bar of pressure difference was 0.92 mol m (2) s (1). Membrane hydrogen flux decreased by around 50-80% in the tests with H2S/H-2 mixture, but it recovered to the original values after removing H2S. In H2S/complex mixtures operation, the flux decrease was smaller due to concentration polarization phenomena. Although no sulfide compounds where detected on the membrane by SEM-EDX, XRD or XPS, the H2S or the employed temperatures seem to induce Cu segregation to the membrane surface. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Solid-liquid suspensions are commonly encountered in industrial production processes. The dynamics of the solid-liquid suspension behaviors depends on both liquid-particle and particle-particle interactions. In this work, an Eulerian-Eulerian model is used to characterize the suspension dynamics and the role of particle-particle interactions in solid-liquid mixing vessels is studied. The collision and friction of coarse particles are considered by calculating solid pressure and viscosity based on a modified kinetic theory of granular flow (KTGF). The solid phase holdup and the velocity are predicted and compared with semiempirical models. Effects of several key model parameters are investigated as well. The comparison between computational fluid dynamics simulations and experimental data shows a satisfactory agreement, which validates the robustness of the multi-fluid model. The proposed model is then applied to study the influences of particle size and solid loading for exploring the importance of particle-particle interactions. The obtained simulation results show that particle-particle interactions can influence suspension characteristics in the case of large particle size and high solid loading. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A stochastic Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method has been extended for handling bubble-bubble and bubble-wall collisions. Bubbly flows are generally characterized by highly correlated velocities due to presence of the surrounding liquid. The DSMC method has been improved to account for these kind of correlated collisions along with a treatment allowing the method to be used also at relatively high volume fractions. The method is first verified with the deterministic Discrete Particle/Bubble Model (DPM/DBM) using two problem cases: (a) dry granular flow of particles through two impinging nozzles and (b) 3D periodic bubble rise for mono-disperse and poly-disperse systems. The verification parameters are the total number of prevailing collisions within the system, the collision frequencies and the time-averaged liquid velocity profiles (only for the 3D-periodic bubble rise). Subsequently the method is applied to a lab-scale bubble column and validated with the experimental data of Deen et al. (2001). A computational performance comparison with the DBM is reported for the 3D periodic bubble rise case with varying overall gas fractions. The DSMC is approximately two orders of magnitude faster than the deterministic approach for the studied dense bubbly flow cases without adverse effects on the quality of the computational results.

AB Water flooding of cathodic gas diffusion layers (GDLs) in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells at high current densities or low temperatures limits efficient operation due to disturbed transport of reactants to the catalytic sites or products away into the channels. We utilize tomography-based direct pore-level simulations to provide quantitative insights into the transport characteristics of partially saturated GDLs with and without hydrophobic surface treatment to eventually guide the design of better GDLs. High-resolution (voxel size of 1.3 mu m) computed tomography images of two different types commercial Toray TGP-H-120 GDLs, one of them untreated and the other treated by hydrophobic coatings, at different water saturation levels were taken. These images were then digitally processed to precisely segment the gas, water, and fiber phases. The digitalized phase information was used in direct pore-level numerical flow simulations to determine effective relative diffusivity of the gas phase, relative permeability of the gas and liquid water phases, and tortuosity in the gas phase. Mathematical morphology operations were used to calculate size distributions of the liquid water phase and the gas phase at different saturation levels for a better understanding of the pore occupation by water at different capillary pressure. Percolation simulations were used to provide information on the connectivity of the gas and liquid phases. The results were validated with reported experimental data and semi-empirical correlations. Power law expressions provide a good level of accuracy for curve fitting. The hydrophobic coating does not affect the relative permeability and effective realtive diffusivity of air; however, it improves the water permeability significantly. The quantitative results presented provide insights and guidance for designing GDLs with better transport behavior. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Non-uniform bubble growth occurs in deep fluidized beds, resulting in generation of large bubbles or even slugs. Gas tracer method, in combination with analysis of pressure fluctuations, is employed to quantify the time-averaged and transient characteristics of bubble growth with respect to the bed depth in a 300-mm ID cold flow unit. The bubble distribution, growth and its residence time in the transition from uniform to non-uniform bubble growth and finally to slugging are investigated. In addition, appreciably better conversion and selectivity in a 1200-mm ID industrial fluidized bed reactor with ammoxidation of p-chlorotoluene (PCT) is obtained by eliminating non-uniform bubble growth.

AB In the computational modeling of two-phase flow, many uncertainties are usually faced in simulations and validations with experiments. This has traditionally made it difficult to provide a general method to predict the two-phase flow characteristics for any geometry and condition, even for bubbly flow regimes. Thus, we focus our research on studying in depth the bubbly flow modeling and validation from a critical point of view. The conditions are intentionally limited to scenarios where coalescence and breakup can be neglected, to concentrate on the study of bubble dynamics and its interaction with the main fluid. This study required the development of a solver for bubbly flow with higher resolution level than TFM and a new methodology to obtain the data from the simulation. Part I shows the development of a solver based on the CFD-DEM formulation. The motion of each bubble is computed individually with this solver and aspects as inhomogeneity, nonlinearity of the interfacial forces, bubble-wall interactions and turbulence effects in interfacial forces are taken into account. To develop the solver, several features that are not usually required for traditional CFD-DEM simulations but are relevant for bubbly flow in pipes, have been included. Models for the assignment of void fraction into the grid, seeding of bubbles at the inlet, pressure change influence on the bubble size and turbulence effects on both phases have been assessed and compared with experiments for an upward vertical pipe scenario. Finally, the bubble path for bubbles of different size have been investigated and the interfacial forces analyzed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the flow characteristics of ice slurry is very important for designing and controlling its transportation system. In this study, a CFD-PBM approach consisting of a population balance model (PBM) and a CFD model was established to investigate ice slurry flow in the horizontal pipes. The pressure drops from the CFD-PBM approach are in good agreement with the experimental data. The numerical flow characteristics obtained from the CFD-PBM approach and the CFD approach were quantitatively compared. The results showed that the simulations from these two approaches present the same distribution features, and they are exactly similar in the main flow region. But the ice particle size, ice slurry velocity near the wall region are different, especially there is an obvious difference existing in the ice volume fraction distribution, indicating that the ice size has an obvious impact on the flow characteristics of ice slurry. The CFD-PBM approach has a unique ability to describe ice slurry flow in pipes according to the actual ice size distribution, thus the simulation by the CFD-PBM approach is more efficient. The CFD-PBM approach was also performed under various boundary conditions of ice slurry flow. The results could also correspond to the actual features. Therefore, the proposed CFD-PBM approach is more appropriate to simulate the flow behavior of ice slurry. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a coupled volume-of-fluid and level set (VOSET) method for unstructured triangular meshes to simulate incompressible two phase flows. In the method, a multi-dimensional advection algorithm, which includes 11 different cases for computing volume fluxes across cell faces, is proposed for the evolution of the volume fraction. An iterative geometric operation is presented to calculate the level set function. Thus, both advantages of volume-of-fluid (VOF) and level set (LS) methods are preserved in this unstructured VOSET method. Finally, the feasibility and accuracy of the current method are validated by three classical test cases -static drop, dam break, Rayleigh-Taylor instability problems. The current simulation results show good agreement with the experimental and numerical results in the literature. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Particle size often varies during gas-solid heterogeneous reactions. For example, metal hydrides (MH) can reversibly absorb and desorb H-2, accompanied by the expansion and shrinkage of the alloy particles, respectively. Although the traditional shrinking-core model (SCM) can be used to describe the H-2 absorption/desorption process, the calculation results from SCM show relatively large deviations from the experimental data without considering the factor of particle expansion/shrinkage. Therefore, we proposed a shrinking-core-varying-size model (SC-VSM, henceforth VSM) for MH particles that accurately determines the kinetics equation with particle deformation. Three types of control mechanism including H-2 dissociative chemisorption, H internal diffusion, and surface reaction were studied extensively, and the rate-controlling step for both VSM and SCM was determined to be the internal diffusion of H. Hydriding experiments on the systems of LaNi5 and LaNi4.5Al0.5 were performed under quasiisothermal and variable-pressure conditions. The simulation results indicated that the new VSM was highly consistent with the experimental data for both alloys, evidently providing higher precision than the traditional SCM. The simplified forms of the VSM diffusion equations for LaNi5 and LaNi4.5Al0.5 were also developed to facilitate their practicability during the hydriding process:
   [GRAPHICS]
   LaNi5 : 1.426 - 1.419(1 - X)(2/3) - 0.046(1 - X)(5/3) - 0.95X + 0.038(1 - X)(2) = t/tau'(diff)
   LaNi4.5Al0.5 : 1.362 - 1.35(1 - X)(2/3) - 0.069(1 - X)(5/3) - 0.90X + 0.057(1 - X)(2) = t/tau'(diff)

SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE

   reactor; Two-way coupling
ID LIQUID-FLOW; HYDRODYNAMICS; MODEL
AB In this work, we present the latest developments in the finite-size Lagrangian (FSL) tracking method we have recently proposed (Badreddine et al., 2015). The FSL method covers the situations in which dispersed-phase interfaces (bubbles or droplets) are larger than individual computational cells used in simulation, and thus not amenable by Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT). But in the same time, these interfaces are not large enough to be accurately simulated with interface tracking (IT) methods for a given mesh. The FSL method thus covers the middle ground between LPT and IT methods. It also inherits properties of the two; bubbles' shapes and sizes are prescribed with a phase indicator function and the continuous phase is resolved in Eulerian single-fluid framework as it would be in an IT method, and yet, the forces on individual bubbles are corrected from hydrodynamic force correlations used in LPT methods. After the initial phase of the FSL method verification, which was mainly focused on simulations of single moving bubbles, we now apply it to the real case of a square bubble column reactor, and compare time-averaged and fluctuation liquid velocity profiles against experiments. The distinct advantage of the FSL method, over the standard LPT, is the explicit resolution of turbulent structures, including the wakes behind individual bubbles. Bubble plume meandering was captured well in the simulations, as well as time-averaged vertical velocities. In addition, we broaden the class of multiphase situations we can deal with by coupling the FSL with an IT method. This extended methodology is demonstrated with cases of individual bubbles and droplets merging with a free surface. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Effect of phase-forming salts on the phase separation dynamics of the three-liquid-phase system, composed of tributyl phosphate (TBP) and PEG2000-salts aqueous two phases, was investigated. We found the species of salts exhibited almost no effect on the separation rate of oil top phase and polymer middle phase from salt aqueous bottom phase, however separation between oil top phase and polymer middle phase became slow with the increase of salting-out ability of the ions present in the slats. Theoretical analysis were provided why aggregation of dispersed oil drops in polymer phase and dispersed polymer drops in oil phase slowed down with increasing the salting-out ability. The effect of salts on the Van der Waals attraction potential energy among dispersed oil or polymer drops, and the hydrophobicity difference between oil and polymer phase play a crucial role. The present work promotes our understanding into the essence of phase-forming salts in three-liquid-phase separation processes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We assess the effect of substrate heterogeneity on the metabolic response of P. chrysogenum in industrial bioreactors via the coupling of a 9-pool metabolic model with Euler-Lagrange CFD simulations. In this work, we outline how this coupled hydrodynamic-metabolic modeling can be utilized in 5 steps. (1) A model response study with a fixed spatial extra-cellular glucose concentration gradient, which reveals a drop in penicillin production rate qp of 18-50% for the simulated reactor, depending on model setup. (2) CFDbased scale-down design, where we design a 1-vessel scale down simulator based on the organism lifelines. (3) Scale-down verification, numerically comparing the model response in the proposed scale-down simulator with large-scale CFD response. (4) Reactor design optimization, reducing the drop in penicillin production by a change of feed location. (5) Long-term fed-batch simulation, where we verify model predictions against experimental data, and discuss population heterogeneity. Overall, these steps present a coupled hydrodynamic-metabolic approach towards bioreactor evaluation, scale-down and optimization. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A fully-Lagrangian numerical model was applied for understanding packed bed structures containing non-spherical solids, such as coke, and the high-temperature melt trickle flow characteristics of such beds. Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations can track the motion of liquids without discriminating between continuous and dispersed phases, and the extended discrete element method (DEM) is employed as a highly accurate method for simulation of non-spherical solid-particle motion. Based on this model, we carried out large-scale trickle flow simulations using more than 10 million particles, investigated case studies of statistical processing, and evaluated the effects of packed bed formed from various non-spherical coke samples. We found that the pathway that the passing rivulet takes down depends on the structure of the void and the neck size between two voids. If the connecting neck is larger than the capillary length lambda = root sigma/rho g p, the slag will drain. The shape of pathway was related that the solids shape factor which is considered by the projected area in the direction of gravity. Even if cokes with similar size were obtained by sieving, low sphericity cokes block slag flow through channeling voids, i.e., as the projected area of the non-spherical solid shape increased, the liquid hold up showed a tendency to increase.

AB Mesoporous SBA-15 synthesized by two different methods and MCM-41 were used as supports for Ni and Ni-Ce catalysts applied in CO2 methanation reaction. The performances obtained for both materials were compared taking into account the differences in terms of textural properties, Ni species and reaction mechanism. Results were compared with the reported in the literature for a microporous USY zeolite. XRD, DRS UV-Vis, H-2-TPR and TEM were used for the characterization of the samples. Catalytic tests were performed under the same conditions for all catalysts. Finally, FTIR Operando studies were carried out in order to establish differences from the mechanistically point of view as well as in terms of CO2 adsorption species for the different samples. Promising data was obtained with the Ni-based SBA-15 catalysts whatever the preparation method. Despite the greater Ni particles size, MCM-41 also reported interesting catalytic performances, so that presenting the highest TOF values among the catalysts studied. The good results obtained for the MCM-41 could be explained by the lower amount of non-reactive carbonyl species adsorbed on the Ni-0 particles surface during the reaction as well as by the enhanced interaction between metal and support reflected in the calculated band gap values. All the results are comparable to the obtained using a HNaUSY zeolite with Si/Al = 2.8 as support.

AB Numerical simulation of hydrate dissociation in porous media is important to investigate future hydrate fuel extraction strategies and/or the impacts of climate change on the long-term stability of vulnerable near-surface hydrate deposits. The core-scale hydrate dissociation experiment of Masuda et al. (1999) represents an important experimental data set that can be used for benchmarking numerical simulators for this purpose. Data collected includes gas production, water production, boundary pressure and temperature from three internal observation points. At least six modeling studies exist within the literature seeking to simulate the gas production data and the temperature data. However, the pressure data and water production data are generally overlooked. In this article we present a set of numerical simulations capable of reconciling the Masuda et al. (1999) data set in its entirety. Improvements on existing modeling studies are achieved by: (1) using improved estimates of the initial hydrate saturation; (2) obtaining relative permeability parameters, a hydrate stability depression temperature and a convective heat transfer coefficient by calibration with the observed data; and (3) applying a new critical threshold permeability model, specifically to reconcile a relatively fast gas production with a relatively slow far-field boundary pressure response. A subsidiary finding is that permeability is significantly reduced in the presence of very low hydrate saturations. But more importantly, the multi-faceted effectiveness of the data set from Masuda's experiment is clearly demonstrated for numerical simulation benchmarking in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Energy-saving separation of ethane/ethene (C2H6/C2H4) mixtures is of great importance and challenge. In this work, we reported an iron-based metal-organic framework PCN-250 as a C2H6-selective adsorbent for efficient C2H4 purification from C2H6/C2H4 mixtures. Adsorption isotherms of C2H6 and C2H4 were measured and their adsorption capacities were 5.21 and 4.22 mmol/g at 298 K and 100 kPa, respectively. The adsorption selectivities of C2H6/C2H4 mixtures (1:15 and 1:1, v/v) were in the range of 1.9-4.0 on the basis of ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST). Meanwhile, its separation performance was also corroborated by the breakthrough experiments, indicating the potential of C2H4 purification from C2H6/C2H4 mixtures, particularly for trapping C2H6 from typical cracked gas mixtures (C2H6/C2H4, 1:15). Compared with C2H4-selective adsorbents through pi-complexation interactions, the isosteric adsorption heat of C2H6 on PCN-250 was much lower and thus could require less energy for desorption. Meanwhile, configurational-biased grand canonical Monte Carlo (CB-GCMC) method was employed to well simulate its adsorption behaviors in PCN-250. Simulation results showed that the favorable adsorption sites of C2H6 and C2H4 were distributed at four corners near benzene rings and around the N atoms of PCN-250. Both the pore effect and the van der Waals (vdW) adsorption energy governed the separation of C2H6 over C2H4 for PCN-250, especially at low pressures. Providing that PCN-250 is used as a C2H6-selective adsorbent for purifying C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 mixtures, this high-performance material can hold great potential for trapping C2H6 from C2H6/C2H4 mixtures.

AB Highly active heterogeneous catalysts are in high demand, but realizing an efficient heterogeneous catalyst with uniform active sites remains challenging. In this study, we present a facile preparation of carboxylic acid-incorporated monodisperse microparticles (COOH-MPs) with uniform active sites and their successful application as an efficient solid acid catalyst for aldol condensation. The micromolding integrated with UV-induced photopolymerization enables one-step preparation of COOH-MPs without any further purification or treatment. The successful fluorescent labeling of the COOH-MPs achieved by EDC/NHS (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC)/n-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)) chemistry proves that carboxylic acids are uniformly incorporated throughout the COOH-MPs. The microparticle as a solid acid catalyst is applied for aldol condensation and the catalytic performance is compared with that of conventional inorganic solid acid catalysts. The selectivity for jasminaldehyde over the COOH-MPs is higher than that of conventional catalysts, zeolite H-beta (HBEA with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios). Overall, the results clearly indicate the potential of this new class of chemically uniform and monodisperse microparticle-based solid acid catalysts for aldol condensation. This approach is highly promising for the application to preparations of various solid catalysts due to its reproducibility, tunability and simplicity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Visualization study on the interaction of the Taylor flow behavior and the catalytic activity in a gasliquid-solid microreactor for nitrobenzene hydrogenation was performed under the long-term operation. The results showed that the gas slug length was first declined rapidly due to hydrogen consumption and then almost unchanged along the flow direction. After operating with a few hours, the variation of the gas slug length became obscure at the upstream due to the nanocatalyst deactivation but obvious at the downstream. Finally, the gas slug length was nearly unchanged. Corresponding to the long-term operation, the nitrobenzene conversion was first kept stable and then gradually declined, which well responded to the flow behaviors. Besides, effects of the inlet nitrobenzene concentration and flow rates on the flow behaviors were also explored. This work reveals the inherent interaction between the Taylor flow behavior and catalytic reaction under the long-term operation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The phase equilibrium in the loading and stripping stages of the liquid-liquid extraction of iron (III) with hydroxyoxime extractant in kerosene was studied over a wide range of hydroxyoxime extractant (Acorga M5640, 3-25 vol-%) and iron (1.5-45 g/L) concentrations. A mechanistic mathematical model explaining the phase equilibrium in the loading stage was developed and validated with new experimental data. The model accounts for the non-ideality of both the aqueous and the organic phases. The composition of the aqueous sulfate solution was calculated through speciation of the electrolytes with an extended Debye-Huckel model. The organic phase non-ideality in the loading stage was described with an empirical correlation that accounts for the effect of extractant concentration on the extraction equilibrium constant. The model parameters were fitted against measured experimental data using nonlinear regression analysis. A mechanistic mathematical model explaining the co-extraction of iron in copper liquid-liquid extraction was developed and validated using D-optimal experiment design and the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The model facilitates the optimization of copper liquid-liquid extraction circuits, as iron is the most common impurity in industrial systems, making process operations challenging.

AB The liquidus temperature (T-liq) of coal ash is above the temperature at which the last solid phase disappeared. T-liq of coal ash slag is widely used to evaluate ash fusion and flow behaviors. The method of determining the liquidus temperature is based on phase equilibrium, the activation energy of viscous flow and chemical composition models. In this work, a linear relation between average molar ionic potential (I-a) and potential energy (P-e) as well as T-liq and potential energy is supported by molecular dynamics simulations. We correlated T-liq (derived from thermodynamic equilibrium calculation) and the molar ionic potential of the chemical composition. The linear relation between coal ash composition and the T-liq is established for the first time, with T-liq = (170.43 - 3.1457 x I-a) x S/A thorn 15.725 x I-a thorn 360.78 (DE < 40 degrees C). The SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (simplified as S/A, calculated by mass basis), a key factor in Tliq, is also introduced into the equation. The relation supplies a convenient method to determine T-liq of multicomponent silicates, specifically using the coal ash based ionic potential of chemical composition. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The main objectives of this work are to present a new CFD-based model for tracking the chemically reacting particle interface and particle porosity, and to numerically explore the influence of particle velocity on the dynamics of the particle porosity. As an illustrative example we consider the gasification of a single spherical particle moving in a hot CO2 gas. The interface tracking model has been validated against a moving-grid method using a commercial CFD software. Excellent agreement has been achieved. Several cases for a moving porous particle have been studied numerically. Simulation results showed that the Stefan flow inside the gasifying particle plays a significant role in the mass transfer governed by the Thiele modulus. Besides this, we show that the Stefan flow significantly modifies the hydrodynamic boundary layer around the particle at low values of the Reynolds number corresponding to unity order of magnitude. Finally, we show that in all regimes (from kinetically controlled to diffusion controlled), particle porosity is at a minimum in the center of the particle, and increases towards its outer surface at all stages of particle conversion. Additionally, we found out that the diffusion-controlled regime is characterized by the particle porosity gradient reaching higher values in comparison to the pore diffusion regime.

AB The first substantial experimental measurements of mass transfer in a rotating spiral channel are reported for counter-current physical desorption of a range of organic solutes from water into air. General relations in terms of bulk properties are developed that allow analysis and comparison across different solute properties, operating conditions and contacting equipment. The phase flow rate ratio and cleaned-phase throughput per passage volume emerge as parameters of principal importance, the former measuring sufficiency of solvent phase flow and the later mass transfer effectiveness and, consequently, required device size. The analytical solution for an infinitely wide channel is used to probe the finite-width experimental results and an apparently universal pattern of differences involving a peak in mass transfer coefficient emerges. As liquid flow rate decreases, the thickness of the liquid layer decreases and the mass transfer coefficient rises. But with further decrease in liquid flow rate and liquid layer thickness, an increasing fraction of the liquid flows in the corner regions under the end-wall menisci and the poor contact in these regions leads to a falling mass transfer coefficient. The peak is found to occur at a similar liquid layer thickness regardless of gas flow rate or solute equilibrium characteristics. Comparison is made with packed columns and rotating packed beds using available data in the literature. The rotating spiral performance suggests device sizes will be many times smaller than those for the two packed devices considered. Dependence of rotating spiral device volume on the square of channel size is demonstrated, showing that further reduction in device volume is possible. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Heat stress in yeast limits productivity in the industrial production of bio-ethanol. One promising way for enhancing yeast resistance to heat is to strengthen the antioxidant defense system. Herein, we developed an artificial antioxidant defense system and used it to improve the thermo-tolerance of yeast for the first time. Engineered strains not only exhibited high- performance on tolerance to high temperature but also effectively improved the ethanol yield. A-SOD2-TTHA1300 showed the highest ethanol yield, 61.4 g/L at 60 h, which is increased by 66% compared with the control. Furthermore, we explored the damage mechanism of cells under heat stress and oxidative stress by detection of mitochondria and cell membrane integrity. These results together demonstrated the great potential of artificial antioxidant defense system in improving the thermo- tolerance in yeast. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents a comprehensive multiscale study of the turbulence inside of an automotive monolith using a porous medium approach and a representative group of single channels. A series of RANS simulations of an axisymmetric model of the whole converter and a 3D model of a representative group of single channels is combined to study the turbulence at different scales. Results of simulations are validated against experimental data published in the literature. Good agreement is achieved. Results of simulations reveal that although the continuum porous media model produces good agreement with experimental velocity profiles after the monolith, it does not describe accurately the effects of turbulence inside the monolith. Literature reports that a transition from turbulent to laminar at the beginning of the monolith channels impacts significantly the performance of the whole converter, but, at the same time, it is usually neglected, due the complexity that it adds to the problem. According to the results from the single channels, there is a smooth decay of the turbulence viscosity inside the monolith, that does not appear using the traditional models of porous zones. This decay can be achieved at the converter scale, via the addition of a damping term for the turbulence to the kappa-equation of the RANS model. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A power law relation between the filtration coefficients of straining and flux through small pores has been reported. The effluent concentrations of the colloidal particles and the exponents derived from the experiment are inconsistent with those obtained from 2D network models simulation in their researches. In this study, a straining-dominant deep bed filtration (DBF) model is proposed based on 3D network simulation. The effects of simulation parameters such as lattice type, lattice coordination number z, pore size distribution (PSD), and particle capture scheme on DBF were investigated. Consistent with the power law formula and the normalized effluent concentrations (Ce/C-0), simulation results indicate that the exponents increase with increasing coordination number z. The change in the PSD parameters alters the flux and weight of path type linked to node, thereby influencing the numerical simulation of staining-dominate DBF on 3D networks. The effects of capture scheme and coordination number on the simulated normalized effluent concentration could be due to variations in the total capture probability for different lattices with the same PSD. The results were obtained from simulation on hexagonal close packing (HCP) and 2D triangular lattices under the optimal conditions. The simulated Ce/C-0 and exponents of the HCP lattice are similar to those of 2D triangular lattice and consistent with the experimental data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It is well understood that during the pharmaceutical aqueous film coating process the amount of liquid water that interacts with the porous tablet core can affect the quality of the final product. Therefore, understanding and simulating the mechanisms of water droplet spreading, absorption and evaporation is crucial for controlling the process and optimising the shelf-life of the tablets. The purpose of the work presented in this paper is to define and describe the spreading, absorption and evaporation phenomena after droplet impingement on a tablet. We divided the droplet behaviour into three phases of different dynamics and duration: the kinematic, capillary and evaporation phases. To model the kinematic phase, we combined and modified 1-D spreading models from the literature which solve the kinetic energy balance equation for the first milliseconds of spreading. For the capillary phase, we simplified and solved the continuity and Navier-Stokes equations using the lubrication approximation theory. Finally, for the evaporation phase, we adopted a modelling approach for the second drying stage of slurry droplets inside a spray dryer. During this stage, one can no longer describe the droplet as a liquid system containing solids, having to regard it as a wet particle with a dry crust and a wet core. In our work, we represented in a novel way the crust as the dry surface of the tablet and the wet core as the wetted area inside the porous matrix. We implemented the mathematical model presented in this work in gPROMS, employing the Modelbuilder platform. Our numerical results (droplet height and spreading, wetting, evaporation front profiles) are in good agreement with recent experimental data that we found in the literature. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

AB Copper oxide supported on silica and supported on alumina are often used as oxygen carriers for chemical looping combustion owing to their very high reduction rates at lower temperatures and their very good mechanical and chemical stability at temperatures below 1000 degrees C compared to other oxygen carriers. In this work, a comprehensive experimental study has been carried out to better understand the reaction mechanism and quantitatively describe the reaction kinetics of the oxygen uncoupling reaction and the reduction and oxidation reactions under different reaction conditions.
   First, the oxygen uncoupling and reduction reaction kinetics of the CuO/SiO2 oxygen carrier was studied. A shrinking core type model (SCM) was developed that can well describe the oxygen uncoupling reaction rate and final conversion. Subsequently, a SCM and a simplified pseudo-homogeneous model was developed to describe the reduction kinetics of CuO/SiO2. Subsequently, the study was extended to investigate the reduction kinetics of CuO/Al2O3, where it was observed that the formation of tenorite spinel (CuAl2O4) and cuprite spinel (CuAlO2) strongly affects the overall reduction kinetics. Assuming that the reduction of CuO to Cu is independent of the support, the pseudo-homogeneous model was extended to include the reduction and oxidation kinetics of the spinel compounds, with which the experimentally determined redox kinetics could be well described.
   Regarding the CuO on Al2O3, The maximum temperature reached was 1000 degrees C in thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) without observing any sintering or melting effects. It can be due to the good stability with the Al2O3 support and the relatively small amount of CuO (13%). However, for CuO/SiO2 (70% CuO), the maximum temperature tested in the TGA was 900 degrees C, since at higher temperatures the sample was melting, due to the lower melting point of Cu.
   The main results of the study can be summarized as: (i) the oxygen uncoupling and reduction/oxidation of CuO/SiO2 and CuO/Al2O3 has been elucidated; (ii) a grain model that can describe the oxygen uncoupling and reduction reactions of CuO for different operating conditions has been developed; (iii) a pseudo-homogeneous grain model that can describe the redox kinetics of CuO/SiO2 and CuO/Al2O3 has been developed.

AB Magnetic refrigeration is considered as an alternative to conventional gas-compression-expansion cooling techniques. While the physical properties of magnetocaloric materials have been studied extensively, the question of how to process and shape these materials into active magnetic regenerator (AMR) heat exchangers for application in magnetocaloric cooling devices is less explored. Packed beds made from gas atomized spherical particles offer attractive shaping options to realize an AMR. In this work, we show that X-ray computed tomography (XCT) allows for non-destructive testing of the packed bed magnetic regenerators, including 3D visualization of the internal bed structure, measurement of the particles' packing density and homogeneity, detection of defects, cracks and interfaces between the layers with different transition temperatures. In this way, XCT can help to understand structural details of fabricated magnetocaloric regenerators and their influence on the performance in a cooling device. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Bubbles have two levels of rise velocity in water called fast and slow. The fast ones are associated with a mobile interface while the slow ones are considered immobile like spheres. Whenever fast bubbles are generated they transfer to slow ones by accumulation of impurities present in the water. In this work we investigate this transfer with a rotary chamber technique. The technique allows the levitation and continuous observation of a bubble on its way from fast to slow. We used standard distilled water conforming to DIN 43530 and VDE 0510 with a specific conductance < 10 mu S/cm. It led to long transfer periods of up to 45 min. The analysis of the bubble trajectory provided the histories of drag, lift and shape. The overall results support the cap formation theory. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Based on the Discrete Element Method (DEM), a bonded sphero-cylinder model is developed to simulate flexible fibers that can undergo plastic bending deformation. In the model, a fiber is formed by connecting a number of identical sphero-cylinders using virtual bonds, which can experience bending, axial extension/compression, and twisting deformations. The elastic deformation and vibration of a single fiber are simulated and validated against elastic beam theories. In addition, an elasto-plastic constitutive model is implemented to simulate the elasto-plastic bending deformation of a fiber. The DEM results compare well with Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations, verifying the proposed elasto-plastic fiber model. By using bonded sphero-cylinders as opposed to more traditional bonded spheres, large aspect ratio fibers with smooth surfaces can be simulated effectively with fewer elements. The new constitutive model allows for the simulation of elasto-plastic materials, such as metals, plastics, and biomass. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the present paper new detailed kinetic model for the methanol synthesis from H-2, CO2 and/or CO using a Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst is proposed. In contrast to most established models different active surface species for CO and CO2 hydrogenation are taken into account. It is shown that changes in the relative amounts of these different surface species, which are related to changes in catalyst morphology, play an important role for the dynamic transient behavior. The model is therefore suitable for evaluating new applications in chemical energy storage, where strongly varying ratios of CO and CO2 are of relevance. The model parameters were fitted to steady state and dynamic experimental data for varying CO/CO2 feed ratios using global optimization. Identifiability is studied using the Profile-Likelihood method giving rise to a reduced kinetic model. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Continuous processing of reagents allows high reaction yields and better operational process control, allied with cost reduction compared to batch mode. In this work, a packed-bed reactor (PBR) system using Novozym 435 for enzymatic ring-opening polymerization (epsilon-ROP) of epsilon-caprolactone (epsilon-CL) with dichloromethane as a cosolvent in supercritical CO2 (scCO(2)) or in n-butane media, was investigated. The reactions carried out in scCO(2) reached yields above 93 wt%, average molecular weight (Mn) of up to 31.2 kDa and polydispersity (D) from 1.4 to 1.6 for only 15 min processing. The apparent monomer conversion rate constant (kapp) ranged from 0.094 to 0.180 min(-1). Otherwise, reactions performed with n-butane provided yields above 80 wt%, Mn values of 25.4 kDa and D in the range of 1.4-1.6, also obtained for 15 min of reaction. The maintenance of high yields and molecular weights for up to 6 enzymatic reuses were obtained for both systems studied. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MELTING-POINT PREDICTION; BOILING-POINT; WATER SOLUBILITY
AB In this paper, we present group-contribution (GC) based property models for the estimation of physical properties of amino acids using their molecular structural information. The physical properties modelled in this work are normal melting point (T-m), aqueous solubility (W-s), and octanol/water partition coefficient (K-ow) of amino acids. The developed GC-models are based on the published GC-method by Marrero and Gani (2001) with inclusion of new structural parameters (groups and molecular weight of compounds). The main objective of introducing these new structural parameters in the GC-model is to provide additional structural information for amino acids having large and complex structures and thereby improve the predictions of physical properties of amino acids. The group-contribution values were calculated by regression analysis using a data-set of 239 values for T-m, 211 values for W-s, and 335 values for K-ow. Compared to other currently used GC-models, the developed models make significant improvements in accuracy with average absolute error of 10.8 K for Tm and logarithm-unit average absolute errors of 0.16 for K-ow and 0.19 for W-s.

AB Recent publications claimed a significant catalytic effect of nickel nanoparticles on the hydration of CO2 to carbonic acid. Others have claimed that such catalysis can significantly accelerate the overall process of CO2 capture by mineralization to CaCO3 from aqueous solution. Having repeated the experiments as closely as possible, we observed no catalytic effect of Ni nanoparticles. Numerical modelling revealed that hydration is not the slowest reaction in the chain ending with mineralization; hence its catalysis cannot have a significant effect on CaCO3 formation.

AB To make the process of microalgae cultivation for bioenergy, and wastewater and flue gas treatment economically viable, it is important to completely understand the gas-liquid interaction inside photobioreactors in real microalgae cultures completely. Due to limitations of the conventional measurement techniques in the literature, only the overall parameters (such as overall gas holdup and interfacial area) have been studied mostly in air-water systems in the literature. Thus, the variation of local parameters such as local gas holdup and bubble dynamics properties like bubble passage frequency, bubble chord length and velocity, and interfacial area in real culturing systems remains unclear. In this study, these properties were studied at different axial locations inside a split-airlift photobioreactor at superficial gas velocities of 1.0, 2.0, and 2.8 cm/s while culturing microalgae Scenedesmus sp. The viscosity of the medium was seen to increase with the optical density of the culture, while the surface tension remained the same throughout the experiment. While, as expected, an increase in superficial gas velocity increased the bubble passage frequency, gas holdup, and interfacial area, the effect of optical density was observed to be the opposite. Over the duration of the experiment, bubble passage frequency in the riser decreased by 62% at 1.0 cm/s, 34% at 2.0 cm/s, and 25% at 2.8 cm/s; the gas holdup in the riser at velocities of 1.0 and 2.0 cm/s decreased by 33%, whereas, at 2.8 cm/s, it first reached a maximum and then decreased sharply by 29%; the interfacial area in the riser decreased steadily at velocities 1.0 and 2.0 cm/s by 40% overall, while that at 2.8 cm/s first remained constant at an average of 1.24 and then dropped by 60% at the end of the experiment. While no significant axial variation in the bubble properties was observed in the riser, an axial variation in these properties was observed in the downcomer due to a decrease in the number of bubbles descending through the downcomer. The bubble chord length and bubble velocity distributions became wider at higher superficial gas velocities and higher optical densities. New correlations were developed, accounting for the change in optical density as well as superficial gas velocity, to predict the gas holdup in the riser and at different axial locations in the downcomer.

AB A systematic comparison between a packed bed membrane reactor ( PBMR) and packed bed reactor (PBR) for oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) on Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2 catalyst reveals the utility of distributing the oxygen feed along the catalyst bed length. A sufficiently high transmembrane pressure difference is needed to realize a moderate C2+ yield enhancement (similar to 30%). The enhancement is attributed to a shift in selectivity towards the desired coupling reaction by maintaining a high methane to oxygen ratio along the bed length. The elevated transmembrane pressure is achieved by adjusting the shell and tube side parameters including catalyst particle size, inert dilution ratio, residence time, and temperature. Under identical reaction conditions, a C2+ yield of 23.6% is obtained for the PBMR compared to 18% for the PBR. The potential detrimental impact of an axial pressure drop in the catalyst bed is compensated by increasing the shell side pressure through an increase in the shell- side nitrogen dilution ratio. Experiments were conducted at lower nitrogen dilution by increasing the catalyst particle size and reducing the tube side pressure. At a dilution ratio of similar to 38%, a C2+ yield of 20% compared to 17% in PBR was obtained, which is on the higher end of the C2+ yield reported in literature for a distributed feed membrane reactor at a low dilution. Ways to overcome bypassing of the catalyst bed by shell side O-2 as well as back diffusion of methane were also investigated. The results emphasize the crucial role of transmembrane pressure in enhancing the distribution of oxygen feed along the reactor length for improved OCM catalyst performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The incorporation of a small amount of secondary immiscible liquid to suspensions can lead to a shift from a fluid-like structure to a paste-like structure. This is ascribed to the higher attraction of the secondary liquid to the particles, in comparison to the continuous phase. However, visual observations on the micro-scale during both long and short term time-scales, dependant on the type of secondary immiscible liquid used are yet to be reported.
   In the current study, the movement of various secondary immiscible liquids (water, sucrose solutions, saturated sucrose solution and glycerol) when added to a model food suspension (sucrose particles in sunflower oil) was investigated. Dynamic X-ray computed tomography was used, as a non-invasive approach, to study the mass transfer on the micro-scale and to observe the bulk movement of sucrose within the suspension. It was found that the affinity of the secondary liquid in dissolving sucrose was the primary contributor to the secondary liquid movement, with density/gravitational effects playing a minimal role.

AB Due to the complex process of copper flotation and the frequently diversified conditions of ore sources, it is difficult to identify rougher flotation conditions and maintain the stability of production process. By deeply analyzing the characteristics of the copper flotation process, the recognition system for working conditions in copper rougher is established and the cascaded recognition method is presented. At the first stage, the recognition model is built to identify feeding ore types based on fusion information of froth image local colour features and process parameters. At the second stage, the asymmetry binary tree SVM multi-class classification method with working condition priority rating (WCP-BTSVM) is used to recognize copper rougher flotation conditions. As demonstrated in the industrial experiment, the proposed method can relatively accurate identify the working conditions in copper rougher and thus can provide a solid foundation for decision-making in follow-up process control.

AB In upward air-water churn flow in a vertical tube, the liquid fed at the inlet is entrained upwards by the gas flow in the core, resulting in a wavy film flow. The present work considers the influence of the modelling of the liquid inlet on the wave frequencies, with the final purpose to understand the causes and effects in an actual flow. The perforated wall liquid inlet section, commonly used in experiments, is modelled in simulations as a simple inlet boundary condition on a short section of a pipe wall. At a given liquid mass flow rate in the experiment, the magnitude of the wall normal velocity component is controlled by the inlet area, which is used as a modelling parameter in the present study. The study shows that the calculated wave frequency is proportional to the imposed wall normal velocity at the liquid inlet. The velocity profile at the perforated wall liquid inlet section was not measured in available experiments and presents a major source of uncertainty in simulations. The parametric study revealed that a suitable value for the magnitude of the wall normal velocity can be determined over a range of flow conditions, leading to good agreement of simulated and measured wave frequencies. This finding suggests, that the wave frequency in actual churn flow is not a property depending only on geometric and flow conditions, but on the liquid inlet flow as well. Simulations were performed in three-dimensional tube section using the multiphase solver interFoam from the open-source code OpenFOAM. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This research is aimed at investigating a novel planar micro-combustor with combined baffle and bluff configuration for Micro-Thermo-Photo-Voltaic (MTPV) applications, numerically. It is shown that the novel combustor outperforms the similar configurations with only baffle or bluff, in terms of the flame stability, efficiencies, and emission. In addition, it is observed that the baffle thickness plays the key role in determining the flame location and, as the result, is the most important design variable controlling the temperature distribution and uniformity since the balance of heat transfer rates across the walls in different regions is significantly affected by this thickness. Moreover, small values of the bluff diameter and bluff-to-baffle distance result in performance improvements while the lower limit of these variables is set by the appearance of flame instability. In addition, for the optimal baffle thickness, the concurrent increase of 6.3% in the average wall temperature and 87.5% in the temperature uniformity are achieved. Finally, the sensitivity analyses reveal that the most effective parameter changing the combustion efficiency and entropy generation are the baffle length and wall conductivity, respectively.

AB For experimental investigations of colloid retention in porous media, also denoted as deep bed filtration, X-ray computed microtomography (mCT) has become a basic tool within the last decade. On the one hand, mCT can spatially resolve particle deposition at discrete points of filtration time. On the other hand, the topological information of the porous media including the porosity and the pore size distribution can be obtained. Aside from structural parameters, the velocity field of the fluid within the pores, which cannot be measured by means of mCT, plays an important role in the underlying mechanisms of particle transport and immobilization. In a given structure, a high flow rate will result in increased velocity gradients as well as increased shear forces compared to a lower flow rate. High shear forces are in turn unfavorable for particle deposition. Another imaging modality, magnetic resonance velocimetry (MRV), is capable of quantifying the desired velocity maps. We demonstrate an experimental approach that combines both, MRV and mCT. In contrast to the majority of other investigations about colloid retention, the porous media investigated in this work are monolithic foam-like structures. The evaluation of colloid deposition in those monolithic filters is based on analyzing individual pores. Particle deposition in a pore is expressed by the volumetric fraction of particles while the pore flow is described by the Reynolds number. Results indicate that pores with high Reynolds numbers are not among the pores with the highest or lowest volume fraction of particles for a given time. The particle volume fraction in pores with low Reynolds numbers is mainly a function of the axial position of the pore. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Combustion of pyrolysis oil has attracted many attention in recent years as a renewable and environmental friendly fuel. However, pyrolysis oil as an multi-component fuel has some differences compared to conventional fossil fuels. One of the main differences is the formation of solid char in the droplet during evaporation. The goal of this work is to study the effect of the solid char on the combustion characteristics of multi-component fuel. An Euler-Lagrange model of three phase gas/liquid/solid combustion is developed to study the detailed information about every phenomena in the process such as: heat, mass and momentum transfer between droplet and gas phase, droplet evaporation, homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions. The results indicate that the presence of the solid char and consequently its combustion elongates significantly the combustion region in a typical spray injection chamber/burner. Moreover, the gas phase reaches higher temperatures as a result of char combustion that creates more heat by heterogeneous oxidation as a kind of afterburner. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Accurate and reliable modeling of continuous catalytic regenerative (CCR) reforming process plays a significant role not only in product and temperature distributions prediction, but also in real-time optimization and control. In this study, a new multi-zone parallel-series plug flow reactor (PFR) model is proposed for the CCR reformer with four-stage stacked radial flow moving bed reactors (RFMBRs). A 27-lumped kinetic model is used to describe the aromatics aimed CCR reforming process. An empirical catalyst deactivation model is designed to describe the axial catalyst activity distribution information and integrated into the multi-zone parallel-series PFR model. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated by the industrial plant datasets from a commercial reforming process. The zone number of 4 is reasonably determined by balancing the trade-off between the prediction accuracy and computational cost. Moreover, the detailed distributions of component mass fraction, temperature and catalyst activity are thoroughly investigated by means of the simulation results of the 4-zone parallel-series PFR model. The prediction results illustrate that the proposed model could provide accurate predictions of product and temperature distributions, which indicates that the proposed modeling approach could be greatly helpful for assisting in real-time optimization and control of CCR reforming process.

AB The textural properties of c-alumina catalyst supports largely depend on the solid properties of their precursors. Precipitation in fast contacting mixers of two precursors, boehmite and NH4-dawsonite, were investigated in order to obtain different and enhanced solid features. The mixing devices, a sliding surface mixing device (SSMD) and a rotor-stator mixer (RSM), were operated continuously. Micromixing was characterized by using a competitive parallel reaction system (iodide-iodate). It was possible to achieve micromixing time from 1 to 200 ms according to the type of mixer and the operating conditions. The micromixing times assessed experimentally are in correct agreement with the theoretical ones. For boehmite precursor, the micromixing time had not a decisive influence on the crystallite size. Better control of the particle surface area was obtained considering the shear rate level, maybe due to a disordered aggregation. Conversely, reduction of the crystallite size with a decrease of the micromixing time was observed with NH4-dawsonite. A possible explanation lies in a higher local supersaturation, leading to a more intense primary nucleation. Moreover, it was possible to adjust the pore volume of the NH4-dawsonite's aggregates with the operating conditions to quite a large extent (0.2 up to 0.8 cm(3) g(-1)). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Coating liquid films on cylinders occurs widely in nature, material sciences, and industrial processes. A typical example is the fabrication of thin solid films, which could be achieved by drawing the heated cylinder from the liquid pool and followed by a drying process. However, in some cases, the surface of the coated cylinder is actually not smooth and exhibits hydrophobicity where the slip effect may come into play. Therefore, in this paper, we study the dynamics of thin liquid films flowing down the uniformly heated or cooled cylinder in the presence of wall slippage. The thermocapillary and slip effects on the thin film flows are examined by a thin film model. Linear stability analysis (LSA) indicates that when the cylinder is heated, thermocapillary effect enhances the Rayleigh-Plateau instability, while when the cylinder is cooled, thermocapillary effect suppresses this instability. However, we find that wall slippage always promotes the capillary instability, and when M1+2 beta/1+3 beta < -1/3, where M and beta are the reduced Marangoni number and dimensionless slip length, the system are always linearly stable. The linear wave speed given by c(L) = 1 + 2 beta, is promoted by the wall slippage but independent of the thermocapillary effect. In addition, nonlinear traveling-wave study shows that the size and moving speed of the sliding droplets are promoted for a heated cylinder and reduced for a cooled cylinder, respectively. The size and moving speed of the sliding droplets are enhanced by wall slippage. Finally, direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the full thin film model clearly demonstrate the role of thermocapillary and slip effects, agreeing well with the linear stability analysis and the nonlinear traveling- wave solutions. Our results offer insight into the influence of wall slippage on the dynamics of thin film flows coating on cylinders in non-isothermal environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, an experimental setup based on the static-synthetic method was used to measure the new experimental data of CO2 solubility in an aqueous solution of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) + N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solution. For the static-synthetic method, the mass balance of compositions and the pressure-volume-temperature conditions were used for measuring the amount of absorbed CO2 by the AMP+NMP solution. The measurements were performed over a temperature range of 313.15-353.15 K, CO2 partial pressure up to 316.7 kPa, and in different concentrations of the AMP+NMP solution. Two models, modified Kent-Eisenberg, and Deshmukh-Mather, based on the empirical correlations and activity-fugacity approach, respectively, were used for the prediction of experimental data. The parameters of the equilibrium constants of the protonation and carbamate reactions for the modified Kent-Eisenberg model and the interaction parameters for Deshmukh-Mather model were obtained. For validation of our setup, a new set of experimental data for the solubility of CO2 in an aqueous solution of AMP, methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) and diethanolamine (DEA) were measured and compared with existing experimental data in the literature, and good results were obtained. The results of the modeling study showed that the Deshmukh-Mather model gave a better prediction of experimental CO2 loadings data than the modified Kent-Eisenberg. Also, the results showed that the solubility of CO2 in an aqueous solution of AMP+NMP increases as the CO2 partial pressure increases while the temperature decreases. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The catalytic dehydration of 2,3-butanediol (BDO) was investigated over a dual bed catalyst system comprised of Sc2O3 as the first bed and Al2O3, silica-alumina, and zirconia doped with calcium and ceria as the second bed at temperatures between 300 degrees C and 400 degrees C. A dual bed reactor concept was chosen to productively couple two different chemistries to direct reaction towards specific products. Both Sc2O3 + alumina and Sc2O3 + silica alumina gave 1,3-butadiene (BD) selectivity of about 61%, while Sc2O3 + zirconia gave lower BD selectivities. Sc2O3 + zirconia produced 2,5-dimethylphenol with selectivity reaching 12% at a maximum. The BDO dehydration over a single bed of zirconia catalyst was studied at various residence times. 2,5-dimethylphenol concentration increased as the residence time increased. Possible intermediates to form 2,5-dimethylphenol from BDO are methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), 3-buten-2-ol (3B2OL) and acetoin. The first bed Sc2O3 selectively converted BDO to 3B2OL, while the second bed catalyst greatly affected the product distribution. Acidic oxides such as alumina oxide and silica alumina were better catalysts to convert 3B2OL to BD, while catalysts with basic sites, such as zirconia doped with ceria and calcium, catalyzed condensation reactions that ultimate lead to phenols like 2,5-dimethylphenol.

AB The dilute-acid thermochemical hydrolysis step used in the production of liquid fuels from lignocellulosic biomass requires precise residence-time control to achieve high monomeric sugar yields. Difficulty has been encountered reproducing residence times and yields when small batch reaction conditions are scaled up to larger pilot-scale horizontal auger-tube type continuous reactors. A commonly used naive model estimated residence times of 6.2-16.7 min, but measured mean times were actually 1.4-2.2 x the estimates. This study investigated how reactor residence-time distribution (RTD) is affected by reactor characteristics and operational conditions, and developed a method to accurately predict the RTD based on key parameters. Screw speed, reactor physical dimensions, throughput rate, and process material density were identified as major factors affecting both the mean and standard deviation of RTDs. The general shape of RTDs was consistent with a constant value determined for skewness. The Peclet number quantified reactor plug-flow performance, which ranged between 20 and 357.

AB In this work, a new approach for taking catalyst deactivation into account in the early stage of reactor design is derived and exemplified by the ethylene oxide synthesis as an industrial relevant case study. In this process, the catalyst lifetime is much larger than the residence time of reactants. The operating conditions over the whole catalyst lifetime and the reactor configuration are simultaneously optimized. The objective of the mathematical optimization problem is the overall reactor performance such as the average selectivity over the catalyst lifetime. An optimal detailed design could be derived with advanced temperature control, giving rise to a higher average selectivity and potentially longer catalyst lifetime compared to the reference case.

AB The effective diffusivity of two-dimensional, anisotropic porous materials with surface diffusion is studied. The continuum model of Albaalbaki and Hill (2012), which couples diffusion in the bulk and surface domains via interfacial exchange fluxes, is implemented to couple the phases. Using a cell model, a new analytical solution is developed for aligned fibres with elliptic cross-sections and arbitrary orientation with respect to the mean gradient. The anisotropic boundary-value-problem is solved using an isotropic approximation to furnish concentration distributions in the three phases. Therefore, the model is more accurate near the isotropic limit and at lower inclusion volume fractions. When surface diffusion is significant, the present anisotropic model reproduces the isotropic model of Albaalbaki and Hill (2012) for unit aspect ratio and a variety of physical parameters. For a sphere with negligible surface flux, the model agrees with Maxwell's theory, and reproduces the model of Akbari et al. (2013) with various aspect ratios. To test the model for several parameters and other aspect ratios, direct numerical computations of the effective diffusivity, using spatially periodic unit cells, are undertaken, and a comparison with experimental data is presented. This model serves as a two- dimensional solution for the effective diffusivity of dilute anisotropic structures with surface diffusion. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Stochastic analysis of a full system of two competing populations in a

SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Chemostat; Coexistence; Stochastic; Asymptotics; Fokker-Planck
AB This paper formulates two 3D models using stochastic differential equations (SDEs) of two microbial populations in a chemostat competing over a single substrate. These models have two distinct noise sources. One is general noise whereas the other is dilution-rate-induced noise. Nonlinear Monod growth rates are assumed and the paper is mainly focused on the parameter values where coexistence is found in the deterministic model. Nondimensionalising the equations around the point of intersection of the two growth rates identifies the dimensionless substrate feed as a large parameter. This in turn is used to perform an asymptotic analysis leading to a reduced 2D system of equations describing the dynamics of the populations on and close to a line of steady states obtained previously from the deterministic stability analysis. That reduced system allows the formulation of a spatially 2D Fokker-Planck equation which, when solved numerically, admits results similar to those from the SDEs. Contrary to previous suggestions, one particular population becomes dominant at large times. Finally, we briefly explore the case where death rates are included. (C) 2017 The Author(s).
