AB The steam gasification of sawdust was carried out in a bench scale plant fitted with a fountain confined conical spouted bed reactor and a nonporous draft tube, and using olivine as primary catalyst. The effect temperature (in the 800-900 degrees C range) had on product distribution (gas, tar and char) and composition was studied. Not only did temperature have a positive effect on the gas yield and carbon conversion, but it also played a crucial role in tar removal, as its concentration fell from 49.2 g NM-3 (on a dry basis) at 800 degrees C to 6.7 g Nm(-3) operating at 900 degrees C. Moreover, temperature also enhanced the hydrogen yield of the gas, recording a value of 7.28 wt% at 900 degrees C. Regarding tar formation and its evolution pathway, as gasification temperature was increased the tar composition (analyzed by GC/MS, FTIR and simulated distillation techniques) evolved to more stable aromatic compounds (of higher molecular weight), such as naphthalene or fluoranthene, with heterocyclic or light aromatic compounds being almost absent at 900 degrees C.

AB Novel polygeneration concepts based on catalytic hydropyrolysis and hydrodeoxygenation are presented and compared via process simulation and thermodynamic analysis. These systems process and convert biomass into high-quality bio-oil and fuels such as synthetic natural gas (SNG), molecular hydrogen (H-2) and methanol (MeOH). Twelve system layouts were evaluated and compared with regards to their energy demands and performances. Detailed thermodynamic models were developed, considering the different technological alternatives for the valorisation of bio-char, removal of carbon dioxide, fuel upgrading and water electrolysis, as well as the opportunities for energy integration. The results show that the standard system, which produces only bio-oil, reaches an energy efficiency of 61% (LHV). This value can be increased by 7-28%-points when co-producing SNG, 10-21%-points when producing H-2, and 10-19%-points when producing MeoH. The highest values are achieved by co-production of SNG as light hydrocarbons are produced in the hydropyrolysis, and limited processing is therefore required to reach the desired product quality. High system efficiencies are possible mainly because of the high efficiency of the core hydropyrolysis process. Carbon conversion efficiencies are highest when generating SNG or MeOH and reach a maximum when electrolysis and char gasification are implemented (98% and 95%). The performance of these polygeneration systems is strongly impacted by the type of CO2 separation process and electrolyser - these processes have a strong influence on the power and heating demands, as well as on the potential energy savings and waste heat valorisation.

AB The paper introduces artificial intelligence (AI) approach for the optimization study of a hydrogen concentrations in syngas via CaO Sorption. The performed model allows estimating the hydrogen content in the syngas produced from biomass in different types of facilities. Bubbling fluidized bed (FB) and circulating fluidized bed (CFB) are taken into account in the study. Comparing with the previous FB gasification results, CFB gasification was capable of producing syngas with higher hydrogen concentration.
   The model considers and covers a broad range of conditions, influencing the hydrogen rich-gas production. The presented non-iterative approach gives quick and accurate results as an answer to the input data sets. The H-2 concentration in the gas, estimated using the developed model, is in good agreement with the experimental data. Maximum relative error between measured and calculated data is lower than +/- 8%.
   The model allows also studying the influence of operating parameters on the hydrogen concentration in the gas. The method constitutes an easy to employ and useful complementary technique in relation to the other ways of data handling, including experimental procedures. The model can be used by scientists and engineers for optimizations purposes and can be applied as a submodel or a separate module in engineering calculations, capable to predict the H-2 concentration in the syngas from biomass via the CaO sorption both in FB and CFB gasifiers.

AB The highly dynamic nature of power demand forces a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant to often run at less-efficient part-load conditions. A new operating strategy called EGR-IGVC is proposed in this work to improve the part-load performance of a CCGT plant. The strategy partially recycles the flue gas from the heat recovery steam generator and manipulates the inlet guide vanes to regulate part-load operation and boost plant efficiency. It allows the CCGT plant to set its own acceptable gas turbine temperature limits at any time and thus maximize the plant performance. Our previous CCGT flow diagram in Aspen HYSYS [Liu and Karimi (2018)] is modified to accommodate EGR for evaluating EGR-IGVC. Then, using a case study CCGT plant, EGR-IGVC is compared in detail with the conventional inlet guide vane control (IGVC). The results show that EGR-IGVC improves the plant part-load performance significantly. It increases the plant efficiency by up to 1.2% (actual) and reduces the CO2 emissions by up to 13.8 kg MW-1 h(-1). By enabling an effective utilization of low-temperature waste heat and reducing the propensity for NO formation, EGR-IGVC promises to be a better strategy for the part-load operation of CCGT plants.

AB The non-catalytic esterification of oleic acid with supercritical ethanol was carried out in a tubular reactor at different temperatures (150-300 degrees C), molar ratios (1:1-6:1) and volumetric flow rates (0.001-0.005 dm(3)/min). The highest free fatty acid conversion was obtained at 300 degrees C, ethanol to oleic acid molar ratio of 6:1 and fixed pressure of 150 bar. A phenomenological axial dispersion model was developed to evaluate the intrinsic effects of the operating variables on the conversion of oleic acid to ethyl oleate. The density of the reaction mixture was estimated using the Peng-Robinson equation of state. Distinct experimental data set were used for parameter estimation and validation of the model. The results demonstrated that the correction of the flow velocity is necessary, and that the axial dispersion effect cannot be neglected.

AB The performance of a hydrogen-blended gasoline direct injection engine under various second gasoline direct injection timings is investigated on a modified commercial gasoline direct injection engine. All tests are carried out at a typically congested city-driving condition using lean burn and split gasoline direct injection modes. Results show that under pure gasoline fuel supply mode, brake mean effective pressure, brake thermal efficiency, flame development period, flame propagation period, and maximum in-cylinder pressure vary obviously with various second gasoline direct injection timings and the best second gasoline direct injection timing for engine performance is 130 CAD before top dead center. Blending hydrogen could weaken variations of engine performance related parameters caused by changing second gasoline direct injection timing compared to that under pure gasoline mode. Besides, blending hydrogen could also reduce flame development and propagation periods, and enhance the maximum in-cylinder pressure under the same second gasoline direct injection timing. With hydrogen addition, the coefficient of variations in indicated mean effective pressure drops to less than 1.1%, but second gasoline direct injection timing has no obvious effect on it any more. Besides, adding hydrogen could reduce hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions by 33.10% and 18.28% in average, respectively. Particulate number has a reduction of order of magnitudes (similar to 10(8) to similar to 10(6) n/cm(3) in average). With hydrogen addition, nitrogen oxides emissions increase.

AB Biodiesel is becoming one of the best altemative fuels to substitute conventional diesel fuel for its environmental and fuel benefits. However, its full-fledged substitution to conventional diesel is hindered mainly due to its high cost of production. More than 85% of the production cost is attributed to feedstock cost. This forces to look for alternative feedstock at lower cost, which usually do have higher free fatty acid content. A number of investigations have been done to evaluate the technical and economic efficiency of biodiesel production from such acidic oil. Accordingly, in this study, three alternative production processes using two catalysts have been designed for techno-economic analysis. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) catalyzed Transesterification and Esterification of Acidic oil; Calcium oxide (CaO) Catalyzed Transesterification of Acidic oil; and CaO catalyzed Transesterification with Pre-Esterification of Acidic oil with H2SO4.
   Super Pro design and Aspen Plus softwares were used to perform the conceptual design and simulation of the different alternatives. The techno-economic competitiveness of three different scenarios were evaluated. The technical parameters were amount and quality of biodiesel and glycerol as well as the amount of biodiesel produced per feedstock used. The economic parameters considered were Total Investment Cost, Operating Cost, Unit Cost of Production, NPV, ROI and Payback time. The CaO catalyzed process could show better economic performances.

AB A parametric study is conducted for a combined cycle which combines a Gas Turbine-Modular Helium Reactor (GT-MHR) and two Organic Rankine Cycles (ORCs) to reveal the influences of decision parameters on the performance and total cost of the cycle. Two ORCs are operated from GT-MHR waste heat. Also, in order to optimize the system from both thermodynamic and economic aspects, a multi-objective optimization strategy is applied. The purpose of the optimization is to maximize the exergy efficiency and to minimize the total cost rate of the system. The selected decision variables in optimization process are the compressor pressure ratio, temperatures of inlet turbine and evaporators, temperature difference in the evaporator and degree of superheat at the inlet of the ORC turbines. After optimization, the exergy efficiency reaches 50.20% compared to 49.84% of the base case. Furthermore, it approximately reduces the capital expense by 2.4%. Distribution of the decision variables for the Pareto optimal front reveals that the degree of superheat at the inlet of the both ORC turbines has a tendency of being almost lowest value. However, the other variables reveal contrast process on the exchange between thermodynamic and economic aspects.

The numerical results indicate that the PEMFC with 30 degrees angle, 0.5 mm width and 6.0 mm distance of air-guide plates exhibits the best performance, and the effect of plates angle on PEMFC performance is most significant. Compared with the conventional channel, the novel channel designs are found to be capable of forcing more oxygen towards cathode catalyst layer (CCL) to improve the electrochemical reaction rate. In addition, these two novel channel designs are able to remove more liquid water from PEMFC to effectively avoid from water flooding. According to the simulation results, the maximum improvement of PEMFC net power densities for the multi-plates structure and integrated structure are 4.7% and 7.5%, respectively.

AB Solar cells are considered as a clean source of energy, and their application includes industrial and domestic users. Most of the algorithms used to design solar cells are tested (and used) only for domestic implementations. However, it is necessary to have accurate mechanisms for solar cell design that can be used in both industrial and domestic energy systems. To achieve this goal, this article introduces an improved version of the whale optimization Algorithm that uses the opposition-based learning to enhance the exploration of the search space. This algorithm is applied to estimate the parameters of solar cells using three different diode models. Such models are the single diode model, the double diode model and the three diode model, each of them has different internal parameters that must be accurately estimated in order to have a good performance of the solar cells. The inclusion of the three diode model is due it represents a more accurate representation of the solar cells behavior in industrial applications. For experiments and comparisons, there are used similar approaches and datasets from solar cells and photovoltaic modules. Moreover, the proposed method has also been tested over different benchmark optimization functions to verify its exploration capabilities. The experiments and comparisons support the performance of the proposed approach in complex optimization problems.

ID ROBOTICS
AB Semantic 3D mapping is one of the most important fields in robotics, and has been used in many applications, such as robot navigation, surveillance, and virtual reality. In general, semantic 3D mapping is mainly composed of 3D reconstruction and semantic segmentation. As these technologies evolve, there has been great progress in semantic 3D mapping in recent years. Furthermore, the number of robotic applications requiring semantic information in 3D mapping to perform high-level tasks has increased, and many studies on semantic 3D mapping have been published. Existing methods use a camera for both 3D reconstruction and semantic segmentation. However, this is not suitable for large-scale environments and has the disadvantage of high computational complexity. To address this problem, we propose a multimodal sensor-based semantic 3D mapping system using a 3D Lidar combined with a camera. In this study, the odometry is obtained by high-precision global positioning system (GPS) and inertial measurement unit (IMU), and it is estimated by iterative closest point (ICP) when a GPS signal is weak. Then, we use the latest 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. To build a semantic 3D map, we integrate the 3D map with semantic information by using coordinate transformation and Bayes' update scheme. In order to improve the semantic 3D map, we propose a 3D refinement process to correct wrongly segmented voxels and remove traces of moving vehicles in the 3D map. Through experiments on challenging sequences, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and intersection over union (IoU). Thus, our method can be used for various applications that require semantic information in 3D map. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we investigate the feasibility of Bayesian Networks as a way to verify the extent to which stock market indices from around the globe influence iBOVESPA - the main index at the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Brazil. To do so, index directions were input to a network designed to reflect some intuitive dependencies amongst continental markets, moving through 24 and 48 h cycles, and outputting iBOVESPA's next day closing direction. Two different network topologies were tested, with different numbers of stock indices used in each test. Best results were obtained with the model that accounts for a single index per continent, up to 24 h before iBOVESPA's closing time. Mean accuracy with this configuration was around 71% (with almost 78% top accuracy). With results comparable to those of the related literature, our model has the further advantage of being simpler and more tractable for its users. Also, along with the fact that it not only gives the next day closing direction, but also furnishes the set of indices that influence iBovespa the most, the model lends itself both to academic research purposes and as one of the building blocks in more robust decision support systems.

AB In this work, an innovative approach to exploit the true potentials of machine learning (ML) by the financial industry is presented; using ML technology not as a source of investment ideas but as a consultant for trading decisions. In particular, the artificial intelligent risk management system (AIRMS) is presented that introduces one of the first efforts in the literature to utilize supervised ML as a risk management tool. Two AIRMSs systems are developed based on two well-known ML algorithms, i.e. artificial neural networks and decision trees. These two systems are applied into the five major currency pairs (FOREX) using signals obtained from an existing technical breakout trading strategy introduced in previous study by the authors, covering a seven-year period (2010-2016). Technical indicators and times series of the past entry points feed AIRMS in order to classify produced signals from the trading strategy into two classes: profitable and not. Constructing new portfolios using signals classified only as profitable resulted in an increased profit of more than 50% compared to the original ones. In this work, technical improvements are also proposed on the application of ML algorithms to financial data related to evaluation metrics and smoothing inputs. The obtained results revealed that the two AIRMSs can achieve impressive improvements to the performance of already profitable portfolios and proved that using ML to build risk management tools is very promising.

AB Due to the widespread use of mobile devices, services based on the users current indoor location are growing in significance. Such services are developed in the Machine Learning and Experst Systems realm, and ranges from guidance for blind people to mobile tourism and indoor shopping. One of the most used techniques for indoor positioning is WiFi fingerprinting, being its use of widespread WiFi signals one of the main reasons for its popularity, mostly on high populated urban areas. Most issues of this approach rely on the data acquisition phase; to manually sample WiFi RSSI signals in order to create a WiFi radio map is a high time consuming task, also subject to re-calibrations, because any change in the environment might affect the signal propagation, and therefore degrade the performance of the positioning system. The work presented in this paper aims at substituting the manual data acquisition phase by directly calculating the WiFi radio map by means of a radiosity signal propagation model. The time needed to acquire the WiFi radio map by means of the radiosity model dramatically reduces from hours to minutes when compared with manual acquisition. The proposed method is able to produce competitive results, in terms of accuracy, when compared with manual sampling, which can help domain experts develop services based on location faster.

DE Machine learning; Decision tree; Stability measurement; Region

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS; FRAMEWORK; DISTANCE
AB Decision tree learning algorithms are known to be unstable, because small changes in the training data can result in highly different decision trees. An important issue is how to quantify decision tree stability. Two types of stability are defined in the literature: structural and semantic stability. However, existing structural stability measures are meaningless when applied to apparently different decision trees, and semantic stability only focuses on prediction accuracy without considering structural information. This paper proposes a region compatibility based structural stability measure for decision trees that considers the structural distribution of leaves from the view of basic probability assignments in evidence theory. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use basic probability assignments to quantify decision tree stability. We prove convergence for region compatibility, and show that apparently different decision trees have some inherent similarity from the view of region compatibility. We also clarify the meaning of region compatibility for measuring decision tree stability, and derive a method to select a relatively stable learning algorithm for a given dataset. Experimental results validate that region compatibility is effective to quantify the stability of decision tree learning algorithms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID OPTIMIZATION; WAREHOUSE; SEARCH
AB Order picking is the most labour and capital intensive warehousing operation whose primary development field is routing optimisation due to its time consuming nature. The Order Picking Routing Problem is a special case of the vehicle routing problem with loading constraints, when the operator visits picking positions and collects items to build transport unit.
   Where the stacking and stability challenges are relevant during the picking of ordered items and exact routing algorithms are not available, the order picking operators have huge challenges to sequence the order picking list. They should take into consideration several factors by themselves, such as product properties, order picking list characteristics, and order picking system properties. The goal of the proposed research is to support the order picking operators in order to make more objective decisions in decreasing the order picking lead time, building stable transport units, and avoiding product damages, when industrially relevant, but rarely discussed, order picking sequencing based on stacking property is necessary.
   The paper defines the Order Picking Routing Problem based on Pallet Loading Feature (OPRP-PLF) and presents Bacterial Memetic Algorithm (BMA) based solutions for it, which is compared to Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithms. BMA has already been applied for Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) but never used for the defined OPRP-PLF. The paper describes several BMA operators, most of them have an alternative which can be completed with SA based decisions. Using the BMA operators with SA methodology is a novelty of the proposed algorithms, which might support a quicker approximation to the global optimum. The possible combination of BMA operators will be evaluated with shorter and longer order picking lists and compared to SA algorithms on the same basis.
   The simulation results highlight, that allowing unit load reconstruction could decrease the order picking lead time and the developed BMA algorithms are more effective for OPRP-PLF than the SA algorithms. The paper concludes that the SA combined BMA operators are more effective than the SA-less operators in the case of shorter (less than about 20 records) order picking lists. While the shorter lists are the most commonly occurring order picking lists of warehouses, the SA combined BMA operators can increase the effectiveness of the OPRP-PLF optimisation.

AB Human activity recognition systems are developed as part of a framework to enable continuous monitoring of human behaviours in the area of ambient assisted living, sports injury detection, elderly care, rehabilitation, and entertainment and surveillance in smart home environments. The extraction of relevant features is the most challenging part of the mobile and wearable sensor-based human activity recognition pipeline. Feature extraction influences the algorithm performance and reduces computation time and complexity. However, current human activity recognition relies on handcrafted features that are incapable of handling complex activities especially with the current influx of multimodal and high dimensional sensor data. With the emergence of deep learning and increased computation powers, deep learning and artificial intelligence methods are being adopted for automatic feature learning in diverse areas like health, image classification, and recently, for feature extraction and classification of simple and complex human activity recognition in mobile and wearable sensors. Furthermore, the fusion of mobile or wearable sensors and deep learning methods for feature learning provide diversity, offers higher generalisation, and tackles challenging issues in human activity recognition. The focus of this review is to provide in-depth summaries of deep learning methods for mobile and wearable sensor-based human activity recognition. The review presents the methods, uniqueness, advantages and their limitations. We not only categorise the studies into generative, discriminative and hybrid methods but also highlight their important advantages. Furthermore, the review presents classification and evaluation procedures and discusses publicly available datasets for mobile sensor human activity recognition. Finally, we outline and explain some challenges to open research problems that require further research and improvements. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper introduces an advanced GRASP-HGA combination for the multi-period Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows and Paired Demands (Mu-PDPTWPD). This variant is an extension of well-known pick up and delivery problem (PDP) where a fleet of vehicles must satisfy a given number of transportation requests subject to many constraints. We include the multi-period aspect to our variant to match real-world applications where sites can be visited by a vehicle in one or several periods. In this study, we aim at minimizing simultaneously the total traveled distance needed for vehicles to satisfy all requests and the penalty involved by serving a site lately. Computational results on benchmark instances are finally provided in order to show the efficiency of the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The formation of high amylose corn starch (HACS)-alkylresorcinol (AR) inclusion complexes was demonstrated using HACS and a crude AR extract from rye bran, and was confirmed by complementary characterization techniques. Inclusion complex was extracted using hot 2-propanol/water (3:1), and thirteen different AR homologs were identified in the 2-propanol/water extract. However, this extraction regime was insufficient to remove all guests from the inclusion complexes, but did result in annealing of the V-type crystallinity, yielding an endotherm with higher onset and peak temperatures and dissociation enthalpy. The remaining guest compounds were recovered by disruption of the inclusion complexes with DMSO followed by liquid-liquid extraction. A total of nine AR homologs were recovered and two saturated long alkyl chain AR homologs (C21:0 and C19:0) were obviously enriched in the complexes compared to the crude AR extract. The formation of HACS-AR inclusion complexes may have the potential to inhibit staling in baked goods.

AB Most studies on improving the quality of wheat flour products have been based on eliminating the adverse effects of water-unextractable arabinoxylan (WUAX) using pentosanase (Pn), but the interactions between the arabinoxylan released from WUAX and gluten have rarely been studied. The results demonstrated that Pn decreased the molecular weight of soluble AX released from water-unextractable solids (57,120-18,450 g mol(-1)). The released AX increased the amount of glutenin macropolymer, accompanied by a decrease in glutenin solubility, but made it more difficult for the free sulfhydryl to form disulfide bonds between glutenin proteins. This might be beneficial to the formation of uniform and fine crumb structures, and produced whole wheat Chinese steamed bread (CSB) with higher volume and lower firmness. However, the gluten network became more open and easier to fracture at higher level of Pn, which made it different to the further improvement in the texture of CSB.

AB Lactoferrin is an iron-binding cationic glycoprotein (pI = 8.7) beneficial for mammal health, especially udder and milk preservation. A new simple two-step method of quantification was developed. Lactoferrin in 1 mL of bovine skim milk was first adsorbed onto 100 mg of macroporous sulfonated-resin at pH 6.8 by rotary stirring for 90 min at 20-25 degrees C. After washing the resin, lactoferrin was desorbed using 1 mL of 2M NaCl containing phenylalanine as a dilution marker, then fully resolved and quantified by RP-HPLC at 220 nm using a wide-bore C4 silica column. This robust, inexpensive and flexible method improves selectivity (no protein interference) and sensitivity compared to previous HPLC methods. In-laboratory validation demonstrated its linearity (25 to 514 mu g Lf mL(-1)), accuracy (110 to 98% recovery), and precision (< 4%), which were comparable to immuno-based methods. The results for individual raw cow's milk were strongly correlated with results using an ELISA test.

AB In-vitro inhibitory properties of peptides released from camel milk proteins against dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV), porcine pancreatic a-amylase (PPA), and porcine pancreatic lipase (PPL) were studied. Results revealed that upon hydrolysis by different enzymes, camel milk proteins displayed dramatic increase in inhibition of DPP-IV and PPL, but slight improvement in PPA inhibition was noticed. Peptide sequencing revealed a total of 20 and 3 peptides for A9 and B9 hydrolysates respectively, obtained the score of 0.8 or more on peptide ranker and were categorized as potential DPP-IV inhibitory peptides. KDLWDDFKGL in A9 and MPSKPPLL in B9 were identified as most potent PPA inhibitory peptide. For PPL inhibition only 7 and 2 peptides qualified as PPL inhibitory peptides from hydrolysates A9 and B9, respectively. The present study report for the first time PPA and PPL inhibitory and only second for DPP-IV inhibitory potential of protein hydrolysates from camel milk.

AB Biopolymeric coatings are effective in maintaining the chemical and sensory characteristics of fruits and vegetables because they preserve innumerable nutrients effectively for long periods of storage. Coatings based on cornstarch (3%), cassava starch (2%) and gelatin (5%) were synthesized. Beeswax (BW) was added as a hydrophobic agent in the polymeric network at different concentrations relative to the dry base of biopolymer. The biofilm containing 10% BW presented the best results in the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) and the effect of the BW incorporation was also evaluated from surface roughness and SEM. An 80% increase in elasticity and 15% decrease in solubility indicated resistance against unfavorable environmental conditions. Physical-chemical analysis showed that its use minimized weight loss, guaranteeing adequate ripening of the fruits during 15 days in a regulated environment: 15 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C, 90% +/- 2% RH. The sensorial attributes indicated better acceptability of these fruits, demonstrating the potential of this coating.

AB Nowadays, the abuse of antibiotics in aquaculture has generated considerable problems for food safety. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a simple and selective method for monitoring illegal use of antibiotics in aquatic products. In this study, a method combined molecularly imprinted membranes (MIMs) extraction and liquid chromatography was developed for the selective analysis of cloxacillin from shrimp samples. The MIMs was synthesized by UV photopolymerization, and characterized by scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectra, thermo-gravimetric analysis and swelling test. The results showed that the MIMs exhibited excellent permselectivity, high adsorption capacity and fast adsorption rate for cloxacillin. Finally, the method was utilized to determine cloxacillin from shrimp samples, with good accuracies and acceptable relative standard deviation values for precision. The proposed method was a promising alternative for selective analysis of cloxacillin in shrimp samples, due to the easy-operation and excellent selectivity.

AB In this study, starches from diverse botanical sources (arrowroot, cassava, Chinese yam, fern root, kidney beans, lotus seed, taro, and water chestnut) were isolated and examined for morphological, pasting, thermal, and physico-chemical characteristics in order to distinguish their end use potential. Among isolated starches significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed in gelatinization temperatures, morphology, color, pasting, and functional properties. Amylose content of isolated starches varied between 17.12% and 35.62%. X-ray diffraction pattern of isolated starches displayed A-type (arrowroot, cassava, corn, and kidney bean), B-type (potato) and C-type (water chestnut, taro, Chinese yam, fern root, and lotus seed) crystalline pattern. The FT-IR spectra of isolated starches confirmed their carbohydrate nature. Furthermore, the current study affords information for the exploitation of isolated starches from the diverse botanical sources cultivated in China that would be convenient for commercial applications.

AB Vibrational spectroscopic techniques were employed to predict the mechanism of starch hydrolysis based on structural changes during germination of paddy. The proposed mechanism for starch hydrolysis dealt with the synthesis of amylase at the onset of germination, depicting an increased intensity of spectral bands at amide I, II and III regions. The process commenced with the enzyme actions on skeletal mode of pyranose ring structure of glucose units followed by cleavage of the glycosidic linkage by the process of multiple and multi-chain attack resulting in decrease of the bands (400-900 cm(-1)). The increased intensity of the bands (1200-1500 cm(-1)) indicated the process of starch hydrolysis and formation of D-glucose. Multivariate calibration analysis (PCA and PLS) was employed to correlate Raman spectral data with biochemical changes during germination and to develop a calibration model. The model showed a high prediction ability with low root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) (0.043-0.568).

AB In this work, we report the phytochemical profile and antioxidant activity of different morphological parts of Rumex maderensis Lowe (Polygonaceae), a wild leafy-vegetable growing in Madeira Island (Portugal). Methanol extracts from leaves, flowers, and stems were submitted to high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detection to obtain the phytochemical profile, which allowed the identification of 86 polyphenols (about 70% C- and O-flavonoids) and 9 non-phenolic compounds. In vitro antioxidant activities were measured against ABTS, DPPH, nitric oxide and superoxide free radicals. Then, the samples were subjected to an in vitro digestion, observing a decrease of about 50% in both the content of phenolics and the antioxidant activity. However, relevant antioxidant capacity was still observed after the simulated digestion. Therefore, this study supports the consumption of R. maderensis as an interesting foodstuff and a dietary source of antioxidant phytochemicals that survive the gastrointestinal digestion process.

AB The present study reports for the first time the identification and quantification of phenolic compounds, the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities as well as the in vitro radical scavenging activity and intestinal cell effects of A. arguta leaves extracts. Extractions were carried out under water, water: ethanol (50:50) and ethanol. The highest antioxidant activity were obtained in alcoholic extract (IC50 = 53.95 +/- 3.09 mu g/mL for DPPH; 6628.42 +/- 382.49 mu mol/mg dry weight basis for FRAP) while the phenolic profile confirmed by HPLC analysis revealed highest amounts of phenolic acids (hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives) and flavonoids (flavan-3-ol and flavonols derivatives). An excellent scavenging activity against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species were determined for all extracts as well as no adverse effects on Caco-2 and HT29-MTX cells in concentrations below 100 mu g/mL and 1000 mu g/mL, respectively. These results highlight the potentialities of hardy kiwi leaves valorization.

AB In this study, we developed highly sensitive and specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against estrone (E-1), 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta-E-2), and estriol (E-3). The half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of anti-E-1, anti-17 beta-E-2, and anti-E-3 mAbs were 0.46, 0.36, and 0.39 ng/mL, respectively, based on competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ic-ELISA) results. A rapid colloidal gold-based immunoassay strip assay was developed for the determination of E-1, 17 beta-E-2, and E-3 residues in milk samples. The assay had a visual cut-off value of 5 ng/mL, and required 10 min to assess with the naked eye. The results obtained from the immunochromatographic strip assay were consistent with those obtained from ic-ELISA and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The immunochromatographic strip assay is useful and rapid for the detection of E-1, 17 beta-E-2, and E-3 in milk.

AB The exposure of Vitis vinifera L. vines to smoke from wildland fires can alter the chemical composition of the berries, such that the resulting wine can possess a defect known as smoke-taint. This work constitutes a complete method for the analysis of simple volatile phenol glycosides (VP-glycosides) that can be elevated in berries and wine following smoke exposure. We synthesized 16 model VP-glycosides, four of which are not reported previously, to facilitate method development. Fragmentation analysis using high-resolution accurate-mass spectrometry demonstrated that the glycone and aglycone influenced the fragmentation pattern of VP-glycosides. Diagnostic fragmentation patterns for the synthesized VP-glycosides were applied to identify several VP-glycosides in smoke-exposed berries and wine. The fragmentation pattern of VP-disaccharides should facilitate the characterization of modified glycones. Putative non-VP glycosides elevated in smoke-exposed berries are demonstrated for the first time. In tandem with VP-glycosides, such compounds may contribute to the expression of smoke taint.

AB This study aimed to improve induced electric field (IEF)-assisted hydrolysis of polysaccharide by controlling electrical conductivity. As the conductivity of reaction medium was increased, the energy efficiency of IEF was increased because of deceased impedance, as well as enhanced output voltage and temperature, thus the hydrolysis of guar gum (GG) was accelerated under IEF. Changes in weight-average molecular weight (Mw) suggested that IEF-assisted hydrolysis of GG could be described by the first-order kinetics 1/Mw proportional to kt, with the rate constant (k), varying directly with the medium conductivity. Although IEF-assisted hydrolysis largely disrupted the morphological structure of GG, it had no impact on the chemical structure. In comparison to native GG, the steady shear viscosity of hydrolyzed GG dramatically declined while the thermal stability slightly decreased. This study extended the knowledge of electrical conductivity upon IEF-assisted acid hydrolysis of GG and might contribute to a better utilization of IEF for polysaccharide modification.

AB problem called wine protein haze. This is caused by the aggregation of thermally unfolded proteins that can precipitate in bottled wine. To study the influence of SO2 in this phenomenon, wine proteins were isolated and thaumatins were identified has the most prone to aggregate in the presence of this compound. Isolated wine thaumatins aggregation was followed by dynamic light scattering (DLS), circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Our experimental results demonstrate that protein thermal unfolding after exposure of the protein to 70 degrees C does not present differences whether SO2 is present or not. Conversely, when the protein solution is cooled to 15 degrees C (after heat stress) significant analytical changes can be observed between samples with and without SO2. A remarkable change of circular dichroism spectra in the region 220-230 nm is observed (which can be related to S-S torsion angles), as well as an increase in tryptophan fluorescence intensity (absence of fluorescence quenching by S-S bonds). Formation of covalently-linked dimeric and tetrameric protein species were also detected by SEC. The ability to dissolve the aggregates with 8 M urea seems to indicate that hydrophobic interactions are prevalent in the formed aggregates. Also, the reduction of these aggregates with tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) to only monomeric species reveals the presence of intermolecular S-S bonds.

AB Aging wine lees are water-wastes produced during the wine aging inside wood barrels that can be considered as alternative sources of bioactive compounds. Phenolic characterization and antioxidant activity (AA) measurements of wines lees solid-liquid extracts have been undertaken on a dry extract (DE) basis. Solvents with different polarities (water, methanol, ethanol, two hydroalcoholic mixtures and acetone) were used. Total phenolic (TPC) and total flavonoid contents (TFC) were determined. The mixture of 75:25(v/v) EtOH:H2O showed the highest values with 254 mg(GAE)/g(DE) and 146 mg(CATE)/g(DE) respectively. HORAC, HOSC and FRAP were used to determine the AA of the extracts being also highest for the mixture of 75:25(v/v) EtOH:H2O (4690 mu mol(CAE)/g(DE), 4527 mu mol(TE)/g(DE) and 2197 mu mol(TE)/g(DE), respectively). For ORAC method, methanol extract showed the best value with 2771 mu mol(TE)/g(DE). Correlations between TPC, TFC, phenolic compounds and AA were determined. Most relevant compounds contributing to AA were identified using data from mass spectrometry, being mainly anthocyanins.

AB The aim of this study was to develop surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) methods in combination with novel gold nanomaterial-based substrates for rapid measurement and quantification of pesticides extracted from lemon, carrot, and mango juice. Facile synthesis of a sensitive and robust SERS substrate was achieved by assembling gold nanorods (AuNRs) into vertically aligned arrays on silicon slides. The nanorod arrays were orderly aligned and can induce vigorous electromagnetic field for SERS measurement. The synthesized SERS substrate was utilized for detection and quantification of thiabendazole in juice samples using partial least squares analysis with R values of 0.99, 0.98, and 0.99 for lemon, carrot, and mango juice, respectively. The detection limits of thiabendazole were 149, 216, and 179 mu g/L in lemon, carrot, and mango juice, respectively. These results demonstrate that SERS combined with AuNR substrates is a quick, convenient, and highly sensitive technique for detection of thiabendazole residues in fruits juice.

AB Several Penjar accessions of tomato grown in the Mediterranean exhibit prolonged shelf life and harbor alcobaca mutation. To uncover the metabolic basis underlying shelf life, we compared four Penjar accessions to Ailsa Craig. Three accessions bore alcobaca mutation, whereas the fourth was a novel NAC-NOR allele. Cuticle composition of Penjars varied widely during fruit ripening. All Penjars exhibited delayed ripening, prolonged onvine and off-vine shelf life, low ethylene emission, and carotenoid levels. Metabolic profiling revealed shifts in Krebs cycle intermediates, amino acids, and.-aminobutyric acid levels indicating the attenuation of respiration in Penjars during post-harvest storage. Penjar fruits also showed concerted downregulation of several cell-wall modifying genes and related metabolites. The high ABA and sucrose levels at the onset of senescence in Penjar fruits likely contribute to reduced water loss. Our analyses reveal that the attenuation of various metabolic processes by NAC-NOR mutation likely prolongs the shelf life of Penjar fruits.

AB A highly selective colorimetric detection method for putrescine on the basis of an optimized derivatization reaction was established. With the aids of o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) and thioglycolic acid (TGA), putrescine was derived to become red derivatives (PUT-RD), the form that can be detected qualitatively and quantitatively by visual inspection and UV-vis spectrophotometer at lambda(max) of 490 nm, respectively. Key parameters affecting the experiment were investigated by one-factor-at-a-time and response surface analysis. At the optimal condition, this colorimetric method achieved good linearity at putrescine concentrations ranging from 0.8 to 200 mu M with detection limit of 0.44 mu M. The method also has good selectivity when common amino acids and inorganic ions, as well as ethylenediamine, 1,3-propanediamine, 1,5-pentanediamine, and 1,6-hexanediamine were used as interferences. The established colorimetric method was successfully employed for the detection of putrescine in 10 commercial fish products.

AB In this study, bio-based emitting sachets containing eugenol (EUG), carvacrol (CAR) and trans-anethole (ANT) were inserted into cellulose (CE) and polypropylene (PP) pillow packages of organic ready-to-eat (RTE) iceberg lettuce to investigate their functional features. EUG, CAR and ANT sachets in CE; and CAR in PP packages showed antimicrobial activities against coliforms (Delta log CFU g(-1) of -1.38, -0.91, -0.93 and -0.93, respectively). EUG and ANT sachets in both packages reduced discoloration (Delta E of 9.5, 1.8, 9.4 and 5.6, respectively). ANT in both, and EUG only in PP packages induced biosynthesis of caffeoyl derivatives (CaTA, DiCaTA, D(i)C(a)Q(A)), total phenolics and antioxidant activity (FRAP). Also, ANT and EUG in both packages improved overall freshness and odor. Principal component analysis separated ANT and EUG from CAR in both packages. The Pearson correlation confirmed that overall quality improvements were more pronounced by ANT inside the packages in comparison to EUG and CAR.

AB Anthocyanins can condense with compounds having enolizable groups to form pyranoanthocyanins. These pigments are less susceptible to degradation and color changes associated with nucleophilic addition common to anthocyanins. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of glycosylation patterns of anthocyanins on carboxypyranoanthocyanin formation. Nine cyanidin derivatives were isolated by semi-preparative HPLC. Pyruvic acid was added to induce pyranoanthocyanin formation. Composition (HPLC-MS/MS), spectra (absorbance 380-700 nm), and color (CIEL(*)c(*)h(*)) of solutions were monitored during 31 days storage at 25 degrees C. Cyanidin-3-glycosides with 1 -> 6 disaccharides produced the highest pyranoanthocyanin yield (similar to 31%), followed by Cyanidin-3-monoglycosides (similar to 20%); 1 -> 2 disaccharides produced the least proportions of pyranoanthocyanins (5-7%). Cyanidin-3-arabinoside converted to pyranoanthocyanins but degraded quickly (3% yield) under these conditions. No pyranoanthocyanins were formed from Cyanidin-3-sophoroside-5-glucoside. Glycosyl bonds were more critical than the size of the substitution alone, further supported by Cyanidin-3-(glucosyl)-(1 -> 6)-(xylosyl-(1 -> 2)-galactoside) yield (11%). Pyranoanthocyanins were hypsochromically shifted and had higher hue angles than their respective anthocyanins.

AB Previous studies have shown that cowpea protein positively interferes with cholesterol metabolism. In this study, we evaluated the ability of the fraction containing peptides of < 3 kDa, as well as that of the Gln-Asp-Phe (QDF) peptide, derived from cowpea beta-vignin protein, to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase activity. We established isolation and chromatography procedures to effectively obtain the protein with a purity above 95%. In silico predictions were performed to identify peptide sequences capable of interacting with HMG-CoA reductase. In vitro experiments showed that the fraction containing peptides of < 3 kDa displayed inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity. The tripeptide QDF inhibits HMG-CoA reductase (IC50 = 12.8 mu M) in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, in silico studies revealed the binding profile of the QDF peptide and hinted at the molecular interactions that are responsible for its activity. Therefore, this study shows, for the first time, a peptide from cowpea beta-vignin protein that inhibits HMG-CoA reductase and the chemical modifications that should be investigated to evaluate its binding profile.

AB The aim of study was investigation the impact of boiling and spontaneous fermentation on profile and content of betalains and antioxidant capacity of red beetroot. Betalains were analyzed by micro-HPLC-TOF-MS/MS method, while antioxidant capacity by three in vitro assays. Red beet products were abounded in betalains, with betanin, isobetanin, betanidin and vulgaxanthin I predominating among twenty two pigments identified. Boiling and fermentation of red beet reduced the content of betalains by 51-61% and 61-88%, respectively, however, this decline was limited when the peel was present. Microbial activity and softening of the matrix induced by the fermentation process led to the release of betalains responsible for strong antioxidant capacity of the juice formed. Generally, the treatment applied maintained and/or lowered antioxidant capacity of red beet materials obtained. Our findings indicate that red beet-derived products are valuable source of betalains, with their profile, content and antioxidant capacity being modulated by processes applied.

AB Flavan-3-ols are units incorporating condensed tannin, which are widely present in grape and wine. They play a considerable role in wine sensory perception such as astringency, bitterness and mouth-feel. In grape and wine, the flavan-3-ols reported to date are (epi) catechin, (epi) gallocatechin, (epi) gallocatechin gallate and (epi) catechin glycoside. This study now shows the presence of a new flavan-3-ol epicatechin vanillate in grape seed and red wine. A putative unknown flavan-3-ol derived from grape seed was targeted by LC-HRMS/MS. Fractionation and purification by centrifugal partition chromatography and Prep HPLC allowed us to obtain the pure new flavan-3-ol. NMR and HRMS data revealed this compound to be epicatechin-3-O-vanillate. Quantification analysis results showed that epicatechin vanillate present in grape seed and red wine in the mu g/g dry seed and the mu g/L concentration range, respectively.

AB This study aimed to elucidate the anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and antifibrotic effects of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) in rats subjected to liver injury with ethanol and Methamphetamine (METH). The liver injury was induced by gavage administrations of 30% alcoholic solution (7 g/kg) once a day during 28 days, followed by METH (10 mg/kg) on the 20th and 28th days of treatment. GNPs treatment (724.96 mu g/kg) during the ethanol and METH exposure was associated with reduced steatosis, hepatic cord degeneration, fibrosis and necrosis. Furthermore, there was a reduction in biochemical markers of liver damage and oxidative stress, and proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, compared to ethanol + METH group alone. A decrease of FGF, SOD-1 and GPx-1 expression was also observed. GNPs down-regulated the activity of Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells affecting the profile of their pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress and fibrosis through modulation of signaling pathways AKT/PI3K and MAPK in ethanol+ METH-induced liver injury in a rat model.

AB Porous microspheres have interconnective external and internal pores leading to very low mass density and enormous specific surface area, enabling them to have excellent adsorption capabilities. Due to this uniqueness over traditional microsphere, they find extensive pharmaceutical applications. Porous microspheres are very promising for gastro retentive drug delivery, alveoli targeted drug delivery, high-speed chromatography, development of tissue regeneration scaffolds and as carrier of biopharmaceuticals. Pore structure and porosity are the main factors that govern their applications. There are different well-established methods for their synthesis, like seed swelling, solvent evaporation, polymerization, spray drying and phase separation. But most of the methods are time consuming and consists of numbers of complicated steps. The size, shape and pore structure of the particles depend on many experimental variables like temperature, pH, stirring speed, type and concentration of porogen, polymer and its concentration. Thus, synthesis of porous microparticle with predefined porosity is really challenging.

AB The aim of this study was the development of radioactive holmium phosphate microspheres (HoPO4-MS) with a high holmium content and that are stable in human serum for selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) of liver cancer. To this end, holmium acetylacetonate microspheres (HoAcAc-MS) were prepared (34.2 +/- 1.0 mu m in diameter, holmium content of 46.2 +/- 0.8 and density of 1.7 g/cm(3)) via an emulsification and solvent evaporation method. The concentration of HoAcAc in the organic solvent, the temperature of emulsification and the stirring speed were varied for the preparation of the HoAcAc-MS to obtain microspheres with different diameters ranging from 11 to 35 mu m. Subsequently, the AcAc ligands of the HoAcAc-MS were replaced by phosphate ions by simply incubating neutron irradiated HoAcAc-MS in a phosphate buffer solution (0.116 M, pH 4.2) to yield radioactive HoPO4-MS. The obtained microspheres were analyzed using different techniques such as SEM-EDS, ICP-OES and HPLC. The prepared HoPO4-MS (29.5 +/- 1.2 mu m in diameter and a density of 3.1 g/cm(3)) present an even higher holmium content (52 wt%) than the HoAcAc-MS precursor (46 wt%). Finally, the stability of the HoPO4-MS was tested by incubation in human serum at 37 degrees C which showed no visible changes of the microspheres morphology and only 0.1% of holmium release was observed during the 2 weeks period of incubation. In conclusion, this study shows that stable radioactive HoPO4-MS can be prepared with suitable properties to be used for cancer therapy.

AB Rutin, a strong antioxidant, has been implicated in the prevention of liver inflammation. However, low solubility and permeability through the gut wall limit development of rutin as a therapeutic agent for oral administration. Phytosomes are described as lipid nanocarriers with a complexation between the phospholipid headgroups and entrapped phytochemicals. The aim of this research was to compare the structure of rutin liposomes to rutin phytosomes. FT-IR, DSC and NMR were employed to investigate the presence of any molecular interactions between the formulation components. The FT-IR spectra showed that a new -OH bond had formed in the rutin phytosomes, suggesting the formation of a molecular complex. P-31 NMR experiments revealed that the DPPC molecule is altered when formulated as liposomes but that these changes were greater for samples from the phytosome formulation. DSC data revealed that when rutin was added to DPPC there was a significant shift in the transition temperature of DPPC. Further, the shift was greater in the THF solvent used to produce phytosomes compared to CHCl3 used to produce liposomes. H-1 NMR spectra of the phytosome samples indicated three additional peaks that were greater than in the liposome formulation. ROESY NMR spectra provided evidence supporting the interaction between rutin and DPPC in both liposomes and phytosomes. The apparent differences in molecular interaction between liposomes and phytosomes did not however impact rutin release in biorelevant media or during in vitro small intestinal lipolysis.

AB This study reports a new strategy for in situ fabrication of plasmonic hollow silver-gold nanoshell (with resonance tuned to NIR region) encased in the hollow mesoporous silica as an efficient platform to efficiently and precisely regulate the release of 5-fluorouracil (anticancer drug) for prostate cancer therapy and photothermal therapy. The mesopores were capped with thermosensitive phase-change material lauric acid, which allowed for remote, precise, and spatiotemporal control of drug release via external heating or photothermal heating of plasmonic silver-gold nanoshell via NIR laser irradiation. The system was nanometric, monodispersed, and showed negative surface charge. The nanocarrier showed better pH stability and thermodynamic stability compared to dense silica-coated gold nanoshells. The drug release could be triggered remotely by applying low powered continuous wave NIR laser (lambda=808 nm). The nanocarrier showed improved internalization by cancer cells, which was further enhanced by laser irradiation. High powered laser directly killed the cancer cells via photothermal effect in the region irradiated. Thus, this system fabricated by novel synthetic strategy provided efficient chemo-and phototherapy.

AB Phospholipid nanoparticles (PNs) encapsulating vitamin C and E derivatives, 3-O-cetyl ascorbic acid (CA) and tocopherol acetate (TA), respectively, were examined using the film rehydration and extrusion method. PN formulations (TA-Cassome) were prepared by mixing CA, soya phosphatidylcholine (Soya PC), sodium cholate, and TA at a molar ratio of 20/80/5/6. Glycerol (GL) or diglycerol (DG) were also added to improve the skin accumulation of CA and TA. Three TA-Cassome formulations were evaluated using a dynamic light scattering (DLS), NMR, TEM, skin accumulation test for CA and TA, and small-angle X-ray diffraction (SAXD) analysis. TAC-assome formulations (150 nm) were stable for two weeks and they encapsulated 1.8 mg/mL of TA. TEM and SAXD analysis revealed that the nanoparticles formed a spherical multilayer structure. H-1 and P-31 NMR indicated that GL and DG enhanced the proton mobility of choline groups of soya PC molecules located on the membrane surface of TA-Cassome. Accumulation of CA and TA in the dermis was increased by adding GL and DG. SAXD analysis revealed that GL and DG promoted the formation of new lamellar structures on the stratum corneum, which contributed to improving the skin accumulation of CA and TA.

AB Essential oils are recognized as valuable active pharmaceutical ingredients attributed to a set of biological properties, which include antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, anticancer, immune-modulatory, analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities. Their use in pharmaceutics is however compromised by their limited water solubility and low physicochemical stability (i.e. volatility, oxidation). In order to overcome these limitations, we aimed to develop nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) as delivery systems for Mediterranean essential oils, in particular Rosmarinus officinalis L., Lavandula x intermedia "Sumian", Origanum vulgare subsp. hirtum and Thymus capitatus essential oils, selected on the basis of their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. NLC composed of Softisan (as solid lipid) have been produced by phase inversion temperature (PIT) and high-pressure homogenization (HPH), using two different emulsifiers systems. Particles have been further characterized for their mean particle size, polydispersity, zeta potential, morphology and chemical interactions. Best NLC formulations were obtained with Kolliphor/Labrafil as surfactants, and using Rosmarinus, Lavandula and Origanum as essential oils (PDI between 0.126 and 0.141, Zave < 200 nm). Accelerated stability studies have also been carried out to estimate the effect of the production method and surfactant composition on the longterm stability of EOs-loaded NLC. In vitro biological cell viability and anti-inflammatory activities were evaluated in Raw 264.7 cells (macrophage cell line), while in vitro antioxidant activity was checked by DPPH assay. Lavandula and Rosmarinus NLC were shown to be the most biocompatible formulations up to a concentration of 0.1% (v/v), whereas they were able to induce a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory activity in the order Lavandula > Rosmarinus >= Origanum.

AB To facilitate the development of PEG-cleavable pH-sensitive liposomes (CL-pPSL), this study aimed to fully characterize a new pH-sensitive polymer, PEG(B)-Hz-CHEMS. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) functionalised with 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (PEG(B)) was linked to cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHEMS) via an acid labile hydrazide-hydrazone hybrid bond (-CO-NH-N=CH-) to form PEG(B)-Hz-CHEMS. The polymer was post-inserted into DOPE/CHEMS liposomes to form CL-pPSL. A validated stability-indicating HPLC-UV method was developed with the aid of multiple linear regression for the mobile phase. The assay was used to evaluate the pH-sensitivity, pathways of cleavage of the polymer and the PEGylation degree of CL-pPSL. The pH-sensitivity of CL-pPSL was compared with conventional PEGylated pH-sensitive (pPSL) using a calcein leakage assay. At 37 degrees C, PEG(B)-Hz-CHEMS was relatively stable at pH 7.4 with a half-life of 24 h. In comparison, at pH 5.5 and pH 6.5 PEG detachment within 1 h was determined as 80%, and 50%, respectively. PEG detachment of the polymer was through simultaneous cleavage of the hydrazine (CO-N) and hydrazone (N=C) bonds, depending on pH, thus the polymer is more pH-sensitive than those with a hydrazine bond only. The grafting densities of PEG(B)-HzCHEMS on CL-pPSL were optimised to achieve a PEG density of 1.7% (mol). The unilamellar CL-pPSL (123 nm) were shown to be sable at least for 3 months at 4 degrees C and have enhanced pH-sensitivity compared with pPSL in the calcein leakage assay. Therefore, the smart cleavable PEG polymer is promising in liposome formulation to overcome the PEG dilemma.

AB There is currently no in vitro technique for assessing plume geometry of nasal sprays under airflow conditions. However, a majority of FDA approved nasal products recommend that patients inhale during actuation. Therefore, a reproducible in vitro test that measures plume angles under physiologically relevant inhalation flow rates would be useful. The purpose of this study was to adapt the recently described Plume Induction Port Evaluator (PIPE) apparatus for nasal sprays under flow and correlate these with nasal cast deposition patterns.
   Mass Median Plume Angles (MMPAs) of four nasal spray formulations with increasing viscosities were determined using the PIPE apparatus in the absence and presence of airflow. MMPAs were then correlated to drug deposition within 3D printed nasal casts using airflow. We evaluated different inhalation instructions obtained from the package insert of nasal products.
   MMPAs significantly reduced (narrower angles) when using flow for the three formulations with the lowest viscosities. An increase in the turbinate deposition was observed in the nasal casts when just one of the nostrils was closed during inhalation, except by the highest viscosity formulation. The turbinate deposition numerically correlated with changes in the plume angles observed using PIPE.

AB Magnesium stearate (MgSt) is the most commonly used excipient for oral solid dosage forms, yet there is significant commercial physicochemical variability that can lead to variable performance of critical product attributes. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is often used as a quality control tool to characterize MgSt, but little data is available regarding the physicochemical relevance for the DSC thermograms. The main aim of this study was to decipher MgSt's complex thermotropic behavior using DSC, thermogravimetric analysis, capillary melting point, polarized hot-stage microscopy, and temperature dependent small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and assign physicochemical relevance to the DSC thermograms. Several DSC thermal transitions are irreversible after the first heating cycle of a heat-cool-heat-cool-heat cycle. Interestingly, after the first heat cycle, the complex cool-heat-cool-heat DSC thermograms were highly reproducible and exhibited 6 reversible exothermic-endothermic conjugate pairs. SAXS identified 5 distinct mesophases at different temperatures with Phase C' persisting to 250 degrees C. MgSt maintained molecular ordering beyond 276 degrees C and did not undergo a simple melting phenomena reported elsewhere. This research serves as a starting point to design heat-treatment strategies to create more uniform MgSt starting material.

AB The study aimed to fabricate innovative drug-phospholipid complexes termed "sonocomplexes" adopting ultrasound irradiation to increase the liposolubility and to enhance the intestinal absorption of rosuvastatin as a model drug for BCS class III active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). A 2(2) full factorial design was fashioned to investigate the influence of phosphatidylcholine content in the phospholipid (similar to 30 and 60%) and molar ratio of phospholipid to rosuvastatin (1:1 and 2:1) on physicochemical properties of sonocomplexes. In comparison to pure drug, sonocomplexes showed a minimum of about 2 folds and a maximum of about 15 folds increase in lipophilicity (expressed in terms of partition coefficient, P). Results of molecular docking, dynamic simulations, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) confirmed the strong interactions between rosuvastatin and the phospholipid via hydrogen bonding interaction, van der Waals forces and hydrophobic interaction. The complexation efficiency reached around 99% and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the aqueous dispersion of the optimal sonocomplex showed spherical nanosized vesicles. The optimal sonocomplex showed significantly superior Caco-2 cells permeability and markedly better oral bioavailability compared to the pure drug. In summary, sonocomplexes can be considered as effective approach for enhancing the liposolubility and consequently the intestinal permeability of BCS class III drugs.

AB The term "disease" conjures a plethora of graphic imagery for many, and the use of drugs to combat symptoms and treat underlying pathology is at the core of modern medicine. However, the effects of the various gastrointestinal diseases, infections, co-morbidities and the impact of gastrointestinal surgery on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behaviour of drugs have been largely overlooked. The better elucidation of disease pathology and the role of underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms have increased our knowledge as far as diagnoses and prognoses are concerned. In addition, the recent advances in our understanding of the intestinal microbiome have linked the composition and function of gut microbiota to disease predisposition and development. This knowledge, however, applies less so in the context of drug absorption and distribution for orally administered dosage forms. Here, we revisit and re-evaluate the influence of a portfolio of gastrointestinal diseases and surgical effects on the functionality of the gastrointestinal tract, their implications for drug delivery and attempt to uncover significant links for clinical practice.

AB In recent time, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have gained vital importance for pharmaceutical formulation scientist for delivering drugs and genes, owing to their excellent surface properties. For example, their aspect ratio is thought to be responsible for their excellent cell penetration aptitude; anisotropic conductivity/semi-conductivity along their axis is ideal for integration with nervous and muscular tissue; an ultrahigh surface area maximizes their ability to "talk" with biological matter; the hollow interior provides an enormous cargo-carrying capacity for drug delivery; and their exteriors are readily functionalized to permit tailoring of solubility and biological recognition. Despite their immense capabilities for the delivery of drugs, genes and other biomedically essential materials, there use is restricted primarily because of the severe toxicity. However, the reactive nature of the surface of the CNTs allowed attaching the guest molecules (drug, siRNA, and diagnostics) of interest which helps in increasing the biocompatibility of these novel nanocarriers. As per the need, CNTs can be modified with peptides, organic molecules, carbohydrates, polymers and used mainly for cancer targeting and tumor cell accumulation. This review expounds different functionalization strategies employed for CNTs that created new opportunities for scientists to improve the potential of delivered therapeutics.

AB Three-dimensional printing (3DP) is a highly disruptive technology with the potential to change the way pharmaceuticals are designed, prescribed and produced. Owing to its low cost, diversity, portability and simplicity, fused deposition modeling (FDM) is well suited to a multitude of pharmaceutical applications in digital health. Favourably, through the combination of digital and genomic technologies, FDM enables the remote fabrication of drug delivery systems from 3D models having unique shapes, sizes and dosages, enabling greater control over the release characteristics and hence bioavailability of medications. In turn, this system could accelerate the digital healthcare revolution, enabling medicines to be tailored to the individual needs of each patient on demand. To date, a variety of FDM 3D printed medical products (e.g. implants) have been commercialised for clinical use. However, within pharmaceuticals, certain regulatory hurdles still remain. This article reviews the current state-of-the-art in FDM technology for medical and pharmaceutical research, including its use for personalised treatments and interconnection within digital health networks. The outstanding challenges are also discussed, with a focus on the future developments that are required to facilitate its integration within pharmacies and hospitals.

AB Elevation of the intraocular pressure (IOP) is recognized as a risk factor for glaucoma development. Latanoprost (LAT) is a prostaglandin analog used to reduce the (IOP). Thymoquinone (TQ) is a major bioactive ingredient of Nigella sativa. The aim of this study was to develop novel liposomal drug carriers for ocular delivery of LAT, TQ and a mixture of them to investigate their IOP lowering efficacy upon subconjunctival injection in glaucoma-induced rabbit's eye. The aim of the present work extends also to study the effect of the different liposome formulations on the aqueous humor oxidative stress. Liposome samples were prepared using thin film hydration method. The physiochemical properties of the prepared drugs were characterized. The IOP was recorded for 70 rabbits using Schiotz-tonometer. Malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT) activities and total antioxidant activity of the aqueous humor were estimated. Fourier transform infrared and differential scanning calorimetric studies confirmed the interaction between the drug and the vesicles, which resulted in high drug encapsulation efficiency >= 88%. The size of the prepared liposomes was less than 10 mu m which make them suitable in ophthalmic applications. The sustained effect was achieved by liposome samples of Lip (LAT) and Lip (LAT+TQ) which were able to reduce the IOP significantly up to 84 h. Morever, the treatment of glaucomatous rabbits with liposome formulations containing TQ in their preparation [Lip (TQ) and Lip (LAT+TQ)] greatly improved the ocular tissue-induced histopathological lesions. None of the prepared liposome formulations succeeded to improve the glaucoma-induced oxidative stress damage.

AB This work aimed at designing efficient safe delivery system for intranasal (IN) brain targeting of the water soluble anti-migraine drug Almotriptan malate (ALM). Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) were prepared by w/o/w double emulsion-solvent evaporation method. Selection of the optimized SLNs formula was based on evaluating particle size (PS), poly dispersity index (PDI) and entrapment efficiency (%EE). Optimized formula exhibited acceptable ranges; PS of 207.9 nm, PDI of 0.41 and %EE of 50.81%. Poloxamer 407 (Plx) at different concentrations (16%, 18%, 20% w/v), with different mucoadhesive polymers (Carbopol-974P, Na alginate, Na-CMC) were evaluated for gelling time and temperature, pH and mucoadhesion. The chosen mucoadhesive in-situ gel formula; 18% Plx 407 based-0.75%w/v Na-CMC, showed acceptable results, so that the optimized SLNs formula was further dispersed in it and evaluated for in vitro release, stability, in vivo and pharmacokinetics studies. Biomarkers' evaluation and histopathological examination were also investigated. Results revealed rapid ALM brain delivery of the optimized formula; Brain/blood ratios at 10 min. for NF (SLNs based IN in-situ gel), ND (Free ALM IN in situ gel) and ALM i.v. (ALM IV solution) were 0.89, 0.19 and 0.31, respectively. Toxicological results confirmed the safety of NF for nasal administration. The achieved out comings are encouraging for further clinical trials of the developed system in humans in future research.

AB Injection of insulin is an effective therapy to treat most patients with the type I diabetes and some with type II diabetes. Additionally, the release of insulin under specific conditions has attracted widespread interest. In this study, a smart drug carrier that can release insulin depending on the changes in blood glucose levels was designed. Combining two popular molecules through facile synthetic processes, a drug carrier of reversible phenylboronate group modified cyclodextrin (beta-CD-EPDME) was fabricated. The drug carrier is composed of cyclodextrin, which can encapsulate insulin, and phenylboronate, which is sensitive to the cis-diols in some saccharides. Moreover, beta-CD-EPDME can successfully encapsulate insulin and almost completely release insulin in the presence of glucose. The detached phenylboronic acid moiety triggered by glucose can attack the beta-CD cavity and form a host-guest complex, which can force out the encapsulated insulin within the cavity. In addition, the insulin released from the beta-CD-EPDME@Insulin complex retains its secondary structure, and the drug carrier has been proven to have low cytotoxicity. Thus, this safe and glucose-responsive drug carrier shows the potential for use in the therapy of diabetes.

AB Concentrated monoclonal antibody (mAb) solutions can lead to high viscosity as a result of protein-protein interactions and pose challenges for manufacture. Dipicolinic acid (DPA, pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid) is a potential excipient for reduction of protein solution viscosity and here we describe new DPA salts with improved aqueous solubility. Crystallinity and solubility screens identified ethanolamine and diethanolamine as two promising counterions which generated crystalline, high melting point, anhydrous salt forms of DPA at 2:1M stoichiometry. These salts significantly reduced the solution viscosity of five mAbs, equal to or better than that for the addition of arginine hydrochloride at equivalent osmolality. The presence of the DPA salts in solution did not significantly perturb the melting point of the mAbs, as determined by calorimetry, indicating an absence of any destabilization of protein conformation. Addition of the DPA salts to the mAb solutions stored at 5 degrees C over 6 months did not cause additional loss of the monomer fraction, though evidence of increased aggregation and fragmentation for three of the five mAbs was observed during 40 degrees C (accelerated and stressed) storage. Overall, this study demonstrates that ethanolamine-DPA and diethanolamine-DPA can serve as two novel excipients for viscosity reduction and could be considered by formulation scientists when developing highly concentrated mAb formulations.

AB Oxytocin is a promising candidate for the treatment of social-deficit disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, but oxytocin cannot readily pass the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, oxytocin requires frequent dosing as it is rapidly metabolized in blood. We fabricated four polymeric nanoparticle formulations using poly(lactic-coglycolic acid) (PLGA) or bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the base material. In order to target them to the brain, we then conjugated the materials to either transferrin or rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) as targeting ligands. The formulations were characterized in vitro for size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, and release profiles. All formulations showed slightly negative charges and sizes ranging from 100 to 278 nm in diameter, with RVG-conjugated BSA nanoparticles exhibiting the smallest sizes. No formulation was found to be immunogenic or cytotoxic. The encapsulation efficiency was >= 75% for all nanoparticle formulations. Release studies demonstrated that BSA nanoparticle formulation exhibited a faster initial burst of release compared to PLGA particles, in addition to later sustained release. This initial burst release would be favorable for clinical dosing as therapeutic effects could be quickly established, especially in combination with additional sustained release to maintain the therapeutic effects. Our size and release profile data indicate that RVG-conjugated BSA nanoparticles are the most favorable formulation for brain delivery of oxytocin.

AB The southeastern Tibetan Plateau and surrounding areas comprise a typical tectonic belt in mainland China, characterized by a complex geological background and intense tectonic activity. We study present-day crustal deformation characteristics of this region based on GPS data for the periods 1999-2007 and 2009-2011. We first analyze the variations in crustal motion and strain rate, and then discuss the 3D crustal motion and local subblock activities, as well as the correlation between the intensity of crustal activity and the strain rate distribution. Finally, we explain the present-day geodynamic characteristics of the region. Our results indicate that the entire region shows overall clockwise motion with respect to the stable Eurasian Plate. The tectonic boundary belts between this region and the South China Block display significant compressional strain, accompanied by associated extensional strain. Relatively high maximum shear strain and the transition zones of the significant plane strain gradients are also mainly concentrated along the Ganzi-Yushu-Xianshuihe, Anninghe-Zemuhe-Xiaojiang, Lijiang-Xiaojinhe, and Red River faults, as well as the western and southern Yunnan Province. 3D crustal velocities further reflect significant differences in tectonic activity between different structural belts. We conclude that the regions showing higher shear strain and the transition zones of the significant plane strain gradients correspond to the areas with frequent earthquakes. According to the crustal deformation and strain characteristics, we infer that the present-day geodynamic setting of the region is related to the ongoing India-Eurasia collision and the associated resistance of the stable Alashan, Ordos, and South China blocks, resulting in the extrusion of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau crustal material with an overall clockwise flow around the Eastern Himalayas and significant compressional strain along the tectonic boundary belts. Furthermore, notable compressional strain and enhanced sub-block motions occurred around the Longmenshan fault area following the Wenchuan earthquake.

AB We present new laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) zircon U-Pb ages and provenance data for the Yanshanian basins in western and northern Beijing, North China, with the aims of demonstrating the relationship between basin evolution and "Yanshanian tectonism" and constraining the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous tectonic evolution of the region. The inherited Yanshanian basin in western Beijing has a Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous tectonic history similar to that of typical Yanshanian basins in the Yanshan Fold-Thrust belt (YFTB), and it became inactive at similar to 138 Ma. The Qianjiadian basin (QJB) in northern Beijing is only infilled by the sediments of the Tuchengzi Formation. Our new zircon U-Pb ages (160-156 Ma) for the pyroclastic and volcanic rocks of the Tuchengzi Formation suggest that formation of the QJB commenced at similar to 160 Ma, consistent with the main episode of "Yanshanian tectonism". The QJB developed in the footwall of the Pingquan-Gubeikou thrust fault (PGF), and records the syn-tectonic unroofing and erosion of the hanging wall of that fault. It was later reformed by the post-depositional Qianjiadian thrust fault (QJF) along the western margin. The formation and development of the QJB in northern Beijing and the inherited Yanshanian basin in western Beijing were related to the "Yanshanian tectonism", especially at ca. 160 Ma, when the intense deformation and large-scale magmatism occurred. The tectonic transition from N-S to NW-SE shortening is attributed to the northwest-ward subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate, and is constrained to similar to 156-135 Ma in the YFTB and eastern China.

AB In the northern foreland basin of the Tian Shan Mountains, strata have been intensively deformed as a result of the ongoing Cenozoic Indian-Eurasian collision. The Dushanzi anticline lies in the northernmost deformation belt of the Tian Shan Mountains. Understanding the shortening rate and paleoseismicity of the Dushanzi anticline is important for both understanding the propagation of the thrust front of the Tian Shan Mountains and for assessing seismic hazards in this highly populated area. Here we integrate lidar-derived topographic data, a high-quality seismic reflection profile, and field observations across the Dushanzi anticline to resolve the Holocene deformation history of the anticline. A reconstructed longitudinal profile along the Kuitun River that flows across the Dushanzi anticline demonstrates a Holocene history of both folding and faulting. The total shortening from faulting is 4.4 +/- 0.1 m, while the shortening accommodated by folding is 12.6 +/- 1.1 m since 7.5-10 ka B.P. A total of 17.0 +/- 1.1 m of shortening has occurred across the Dushanzi anticline in the Holocene at a rate of 2.0 +/- 0.2 mm/a. This shortening represents up to 18% of the > 11 mm/a total shortening rate across the entire eastern Tian Shan Mountains at this longitude. The Holocene shortening rate of the Dushanzi anticline is similar to 6 times greater than its long-term average shortening rate (0.3 +/- 0.1 mm/a) since 4.8 Ma. Furthermore, we analyzed a displaced terrace sequence at a site along the Dushanzi frontal fault and found that the average coseismic dip-slip displacement is 2.5 +/- 0.1 m, with an average recurrence interval of 2.8 +/- 0.3 ka.

AB Guangxi province, located in South China, is a typical karst region affected by acid depositions for a couple of decades. Water samples from the major river basins in this region were collected and the chemical compositions were measured with a main purpose to quantify chemical weathering rates and associated CO2 budget. The average total dissolved solids (TDS) of the river waters (232 mg/l) are comparable with other karstic rivers. The major ion compositions of the river waters are characterized by the dominance of Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3-, and are significantly rich in SO42-. The chemical compositions of the river waters indicate that four major reservoirs (atmospheric, anthropogenic, carbonate and silicate inputs) contribute to the dissolved loads. The carbonate chemical weathering rates range from 61.4 t/km(2)/yr for the Qingshuihe river basin to 93.3 t/km(2)/yr for the Zuojiang river basin. The silicate chemical weathering rates range from 2.9 t/km(2)/yr for the Qingshuihe river basin to 7.9 t/km(2)/yr for the Liujiang river basin. The CO2 consumption rates by carbonate weathering range from 559 x 10(3) mol/km(2)/yr for the Qingshuihe river basin to 817 x 10(3) mol/km(2)/yr for the Zuojiang river basin. The CO2 consumption rates by silicate weathering range from 19 x 10(3) mol/km(2)/yr for the Zuojiang river basin to 85 x 10(3) mol/km(2)/yr for the Liujiang river basin. Sulfuric acid is involved as a proton donor in weathering reactions, and about 9-15% of the chemical weathering rates of the river basins are sulfuric acid-induced. The CO2 consumption rates are only 85-91% of the value when assuming carbonic acid provides all the protons in the weathering reactions. The CO2 released from sulfuric acid-induced carbonate weathering would exceed the CO2 consumed by silicate weathering, making the river basins in Guangxi net CO2 sources on geological timescales. The total net CO2 releasing flux is approximately 15.7 x 10(9) mol/yr (0.19 x 10(12) gC/yr). This result quantitatively highlights the fact that CO2 budget by chemical weathering will be largely modified by sulfuric acid, especially in seriously acid deposition affected region.

AB This work integrates processing and interpretation of the combined geomagnetic anomaly model of NGDC-720-V3.1 to better constrain thermal structures of the Northeast China lithosphere, which shows intensive extension and active volcanism during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. Numerical tests demonstrate that magnetic anomalies calculated at 20 km altitude can be used for accurate Curie depth estimation. Averaged Curie depths using a 3D fractal exponent of 3.0 vary from similar to 13 +/- 2.0 to 33 +/- 4.11an with a mean of similar to 22 +/- 2.4 km in Northeast China. With temperature-dependent thermal conductivity models constrained by incorporated surface heat flow and Curie depths in different geological blocks, the thermal lithospheric thicknesses are estimated mostly between 45 and 90 km based on 1D steady-state thermal conduction equation. Beneath the Songliao Basin, the Moho temperatures are abnormally high, ranging from ca. 700 to 1000 degrees C, and the mantle contributes about 65% of the total surface heat flow. The shallow Curie points and thermal lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, together with high Moho temperatures and mantle heat flow, support abnormally high geotherms in the Songliao Basin, originated from hot upper mantle upwelling triggered likely by lithospheric delamination.

TI 3D gravity anomaly separation method taking into account the gravity

AB In order to ensure that the gravity data processing and inversion are consistent with the actual geology, we propose that, in integrated geophysical research, 3D gravity anomaly separation (GAS) should take into account the gravity response of the inhomogeneous mantle. This is an effective method by which the residual gravity anomaly (RGA) may be obtained, as well as an important basis for the inversion and interpretation of gravity data. Aimed at the petroliferous basin structure, evolution of continental margin, ocean continental transition zone and other widely discussed geological problems, we extensively investigate the upper mantle structure in many regions around the world, and the results show that the lateral inhomogeneity of the mantle is widespread. In many comprehensive studies based on gravity and seismic data, the gravity anomaly modeling and separation are typically performed within the crust (above the Moho), which actually relies on an assumption of homogeneous mantle. Although this assumption simplifies the difficulty of the gravity modeling and separation, it ignores gravity anomalies caused by inhomogeneities of the deep mantle. The RGA, along with the inverted density structure and other interpretations, involves the risk of deviating from the actual geology. On the basis of the 2D forward calculation of several typical interface models, we implement the quantitative analysis of the effect that the inhomogeneous mantle has on the Bouguer gravity anomaly. In case studies of the southeastern United States and the Sichuan Basin, taking the shear wave velocity (Vs) structure of the upper mantle as the constraint condition, we calculate the gravity anomaly caused by the inhomogeneous mantle by means of the forward method. It is found that the gravity response of the inhomogeneous mantle cannot be neglected. Therefore, we conduct 2.5D joint simulation combining gravity and seismic data in the Sichuan Basin. The fitting results after separating the gravity response of the inhomogeneous mantle are clearly superior to those of the homogeneous mantle hypothesis. On the basis of the 3D depth data of several sedimentary strata, the Moho and the mantle high-velocity bodies, we implement 3D GAS, obtain the RGA of the basement in the Sichuan Basin, and discuss the geological origin of the "Dazu high gravity".

AB At low terminal Reynolds numbers Re = 2-10, there are multiple asymmetrical principal movement states for the sedimentation of a pair of particles in a channel filled with a viscous fluid. The main emphasis of this work is to investigate the formation process of these states and the effect of the natural rotation on the process when particles are released symmetrically. The flow field around each particle is fully resolved with an Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) coupled with the Cascaded Lattice Boltzmann Method (CLBM). An improved algorithm is developed to couple IBM with CLBM which can fully exploit the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) for parallelisation. The collision between particles is handled with the Discrete Element Model (DEM). The approach is validated considering the sedimentation of a single particle released asymmetrically and also the Drafting-Kissing-Tumbling (DKr) problem of two particles.
   The trajectories of particles corresponding to different principal movement states are determined for the sedimentation of a pair of particles released symmetrically in a long narrow channel. By analysing the trajectories, it is found that particles go through two distinct symmetry breaking phenomena, a sudden lateral migration that leads to asymmetrically moving centres, and (or) a divergent oscillation that leads to a zero phase lag between the fundamental frequencies of oscillating particles. Since particle's lateral movement and natural rotation display a strong coherence of nearly 1.0 over a transitional oscillatory period, the trajectories of particles without rotational degree-of-freedom are then considered to determine the impacts of natural rotation on the principal movement states. It is shown that the lateral migration can still take place even after removing the rotational degree-of-freedom. However, the divergent oscillation disappears, which makes particles move in a steady oblique or horizontal structure and leads to a smaller terminal Reynolds number. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB The asymptotic, physical optics (PO) approximation is applicable to electromagnetic scattering analysis of electrically large, conducting objects, which is important for various applications, such as radar cross-section (RCS) calculations. It relates the incident magnetic field to the induced surface current at points on a scatterer's surface with line-of-sight visibility to the source. Here, the focus is on mesh-based PO, using a triangle element mesh with standard Rao-Wilton-Glisson basis functions to represent the surface current density. The multiple-reflection PO (MRPO) method involves applying the PO approximation to the field radiated by the present current solution towards the scatterer itself, to account for successive internal reflections. The visibility status between every pair of basis functions is required, taking into account all geometry. In a conventional implementation, internal reflected field calculation and internal shadowing determination runtimes both scale as O(N-2); N denotes the number of mesh elements. In this paper an accelerated version of the mesh-based MRPO method is presented: fast MRPO (FMRPO). The multi-level, fast multipole method (MLFMM) is used to accelerate internal reflected field calculation. The key aspect to achieving acceleration for general geometries, is to incorporate internal shadowing into the MLFMM interaction tree. This requires an alteration to the intergroup interaction criterion of the MLFMM, as well as efficient evaluation of intergroup shadowing status flags, to preserve the beneficial cost-scaling property of the MLFMM. Algorithmic parameters are introduced, which control the accuracy of internal shadowing determination. The FMRPO runtime scales as O(NlogN), in the high-frequency limit. Numerical results are presented, demonstrating accuracy and efficiency for general scattering objects. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present the implementation of the density functional theory based charge patching method using the basis of Gaussian functions. The method is based on the assumption that the electronic charge density of a large system is the sum of contributions of individual atoms, so called charge density motifs, that are obtained from calculations of small prototype systems. In our implementation wave functions and electronic charge density are represented using the basis of Gaussian functions, while charge density motifs are represented using a real space grid. A constrained minimization procedure is used to obtain Gaussian basis representation of charge density from real space representation of motifs. The code based on this implementation exhibits superior performance in comparison to previous implementation of the charge patching method using the basis of plane waves. It enables calculations of electronic structure of systems with around 1000 atoms on a single CPU core with computational time of just several hours. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A domain decomposition algorithm is introduced to couple nonisothermal compositional gas liquid Darcy and free gas flow and transport. At each time step, our algorithm solves iteratively the nonlinear system coupling the nonisothermal compositional Darcy flow in the porous medium, the RANS gas flow in the free-flow domain, and the transport of the species and of energy in the free-flow domain. In order to speed up the convergence of the algorithm, the transmission conditions at the interface are replaced by Robin type boundary conditions. The Robin coefficients are obtained from a diagonal approximation of the Dirichlet to Neumann operator related to a simplified model in the neighboring subdomain. The efficiency of our domain decomposition algorithm is assessed on several test cases focusing on the modeling of the mass and energy exchanges at the interface between the geological formation and the ventilation galleries of geological radioactive waste disposal.

ID EQUATIONS
AB A standard inverse problem is to determine a source which is supported in an unknown domain D from external boundary measurements. Here we consider the case of a time-independent situation where the source is equal to unity in an unknown subdomain D of a larger given domain Omega and the boundary of D has the star-like shape, i.e.
   partial derivative D = {q(theta)(cos theta, sin theta)(T) : theta is an element of [0, 2 pi]}.
   Overposed measurements consist of time traces of the solution or its flux values on a set of discrete points on the boundary partial derivative Omega. The case of a parabolic equation was considered in [6]. In our situation we extend this to cover the subdiffusion case based on an anomalous diffusion model and leading to a fractional order differential operator. We will show a uniqueness result and examine a reconstruction algorithm. One of the main motives for this work is to examine the dependence of the reconstructions on the parameter alpha, the exponent of the fractional operator which controls the degree of anomalous behaviour of the process. Some previous inverse problems based on fractional diffusion models have shown considerable differences between classical Brownian diffusion and the anomalous case. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB The Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) model was used to derive estimates of suspended-sediment concentration (SSC) and suspended-sediment load (SSL), their dependence on discharge, and their trends with confidence intervals, for one site each on the lowermost Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers. The WRTDS model reduces uncertainty in SSCs related to variable streamflow conditions. Flow-normalized SSCs in each river were similar, and decreased from about 260 mg/L to 130 mg/L from 1980 through 2015; combined annual SSL in the two rivers decreased from about 200 Megatons per year (MT/y) to about 100 MT/y. Declines in SSC and SSL were more gradual from 2005 through 2015 and show signs of stabilizing. Our estimates of SSL in 2015 differ markedly from several recently published estimates of current and projected future Mississippi River SSLs, which were generally around 200 MT/y. However, these values came mostly from a different site upstream on the Mississippi River. The relationship between SSC and streamflow differed in an important way between the two rivers. SSC increased as streamflow increased for the entire range of observed streamflow in the Atchafalaya River. In the Mississippi River, SSC followed the same pattern during low and moderate streamflow but decreased at the highest streamflow that tended to occur between January and July. Since much of the water flowing in the Atchafalaya originates from the Mississippi River, the difference suggests a within-basin source of suspended sediment for the Atchafalaya River that is absent in the lower Mississippi River. These findings have important implications for the restoration of deltaic wetlands in coastal Louisiana. Accurate estimates of the SSL available in each river are crucial for understanding how effective diversions of river water into adjacent estuaries will be in sustaining these wetlands. Our study demonstrates that there might be far less sediment available than previously reported. Further, the difference in the relationship between SSC and streamflow in the two rivers is highly relevant to the ongoing discussion of coastal restoration strategies because the delta building that is occurring at the mouth of the Atchafalaya River is frequently used as a model of what could be expected with controlled diversions in the lower Mississippi River delta. The differences in the SSC behavior with changes in streamflow between the two rivers needs to be considered when results from the Atchafalaya River system are projected to those of the Mississippi River.

AB Downscaling is the process by which output from global climate models is translated to finer resolution regional scale projections often used in impact studies. Many fundamentally different techniques can be used, each with different capabilities of resolving or representing sub-gridscale processes. The different formulations can lead to variations in the downscaled output with consequential impacts in the interpretation of future change. Here, future runoff is estimated for six catchments in the Australian state of Victoria using five different regional rainfall projection products. We investigate how differences in rainfall input manifest in a selection of regionally important hydroclimate metrics. Overall, annual runoff is projected to decline under most methods, but seasonal changes are more uncertain reflecting differences in the rainfall change signal for different downscaled products. Whilst change in flow metrics are mostly consistent with rainfall change factors, changes in low flow (e.g. 7-day minimum flow) show considerable uncertainty, especially for drier, ephemeral catchments. Results from empirical (simple) scaling of climate observations generally lie within the range of more complex downscaling methods. However, empirical scaling is unable to provide meaningful information on spatial heterogeneity in the change signals, as well as for several metrics of rainfall and runoff. Other downscaling methods can potentially provide information on these, but the large uncertainty remains a problem, as well as our currently poor understanding of method-related biases.

AB This study presents a new approach for complex networks-based analysis of temporal streamflow dynamics. The novelty comes in the form of using nonlinear dynamic concepts to construct the temporal streamflow network. The approach involves three steps. First, the single-variable streamflow time series is represented in a multidimensional phase space using delay embedding, i.e. phase space reconstruction. Next, this reconstructed phase space is treated as a network, with the reconstructed vectors (instead of the streamflow values themselves) serving as the nodes and the connections between them serving as the links. Finally, the strength of each node in the network is determined using a distance metric. The approach is employed independently to monthly streamflow time series observed over a period of 53 years (January 1950-December 2002) from each of 639 stations in the contiguous United States. For each time series, different delay time values for phase space reconstruction are considered and the optimum embedding dimension is determined using the false nearest neighbor (FNN) method. The results indicate the usefulness of the phase space reconstruction-based network construction for examining the temporal connections in streamflow. The distribution of the strengths of nodes for any streamflow network is used to identify the type of the underlying network. The average node strength of each of the 639 streamflow networks are also interpreted: (1) to identify similarities and differences between the stations; (2) to explain the role of catchment and flow properties (drainage area, elevation, and flow mean) on network strength; and (3) to assess the influence of time (i.e. month of the year) on network strength.

AB Given the high cost of data acquisition in soil water problems, it is becoming increasingly essential to collect the measurements as cost-efficient as possible. By introducing the data-worth analysis framework coupled with Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), this real-world case study attempts to assess the worth of potential soil moisture observations before data collection. A field experiment was implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of quantifying the effect of future data on uncertainty reduction under real circumstances in a sequential way. The data worth of future observations is defined regarding soil hydraulic parameter estimation or soil moisture profile retrieval. Four information measures, including the trace (T-r), Shannon entropy difference (SD), relative entropy (RE) and degrees of freedom for signal (DFS), are introduced to quantify the information content. The sequential data worth analysis framework is examined by a number of cases, including under different irrigation intensities, with different prior data (existing observations that have already been collected), and with data of various depths and different measurement errors. We demonstrated the ability, and the challenge as well, of quantifying the data worth sequentially. Our results showed that data worth assessment regarding soil moisture profile retrieval is more difficult than that regarding parameter identification. Variance-type and covariance-type metrics have relatively loose accuracy requirement on potential observations (future possible observations to be collected), while mean-covariance-type metrics require higher accuracy. The vertical covariance of soil moisture is susceptible to the effect of atmospheric boundary condition, which eventually imposes a challenge on the quantification of data worth with covariance involved indices. The match between the expected and reference data worth can be improved by assimilating more prior data. However, more prior data cannot compensate for the damage from possible model structural error due to the changed scenarios between the prior stage and the posterior or preposterior stage. Shallow soil moisture data generally has larger data worth than deep observations in our study, but evaluating data worth with shallow data is subject to considerable uncertainty if covariance-type or mean-covariance-type index is employed. Smaller measurement error does not always lead to improved data worth estimation.

AB The objective of this research is to improve the understanding and recognition of the management challenges to flash flooding hazards and the potential adaptive measures within the arid urban areas through a socio-hydrological framework. Considering the capital of Sudan, Khartoum, as an example of urban arid areas with increasing flash flood risk, the analysis was founded on expert views and opinions collected from a range of different flood management actors following the 2013 and 2014 flash flood events. The qualitative research methods included participant observation, expert interviews and focus groups. The main themes of management challenges recorded included weak institutional capacity, bad governance, limited resources, and poor urban planning. These four themes, in turn, included different types of challenges, among which lack of: civil society engagement and coordination of actors, political will, data and tools, and effective urban development strategy shared the highest number of comments from the professional actors in each theme, respectively. These findings presented a management perspective to the lessons previously established and learned from an impact assessment. Accordingly, the amalgamation of all the lessons learned from the flood research findings enabled a suitable Master Flash Flood Management Plan (MaFFMaP) to be proposed as a final product. This plan would operate within an Integrated Flash Flood Management (IFFM) framework. The facets of the MaFFMaP include steps toward improving the quantity and quality of data resources regarding this hazard, aspects for use of these new datasets within a mixed-measure (structural and non-structural) approach from the authorities, and programmes for building community and civil society capacity through improving awareness and engagement. Furthermore, it is intended that this plan would be a replicable design, which could therefore be adopted and implemented in the wider context of the urban arid regions.

ID ATOLL ISLANDS; MANAGEMENT; CHALLENGES; DYNAMICS; AQUIFER; CLIMATE;
   RESOURCES
AB Groundwater on islands occurs in the form of freshwater lenses that serve as an important water resource for local inhabitants. These lenses are highly vulnerable to salinization due to natural recharge variations and groundwater abstraction. Determining the sustainable yield from freshwater lenses is challenging because the lens response during drought periods and the long-term effects of pumping are both difficult to predict. The exceptionally detailed and long data record for Bonriki Island of the Tarawa atoll (Kiribati) made it possible to develop a three-dimensional variable-density model of the island. Field data and modelling results highlight the strong control of rainfall variability and pumping on the temporal dynamics of the freshwater lens. The model reproduces the salinity observations in both monitoring and pumping wells reasonably well, and provides a rare example of physically based island simulation based on an extensive data set. It enables the analysis of freshwater volume and fluxes of submarine groundwater discharge, which is impossible based on the field observations alone. Under natural as well as abstraction conditions, submarine groundwater discharge responds rapidly and almost proportionally to recharge. Theoretical model scenarios with scaled abstraction rates show that lens contraction caused by pumping is a nearly linear function of the total pumped volume, whereby the abstraction rate and the timing of depletion are approximately inversely proportional. Modelling indicates that when monthly recharge inputs fall below around 2500 m(3)/d (i.e., a flux of 1.7 mm/d) plus the abstraction rate, the lens tends to contract. Thus, despite the highly distributed and extensive abstraction network on Bonriki Island, a significant amount of recharge is eventually lost to submarine groundwater discharge. The long-term freshwater storage trend indicates that Bonriki Island's lens is still contracting after 27.5 years of pumping, and lens thinning is threatening to impact the water supply salinity. This means that even permeable, small islands like Bonriki may take at least two decades to realise new equilibrium conditions that reflect pumping stresses, which is an important consideration in assessing the sustainable yield of small islands, in particular those less resilient to pumping than Bonriki.

AB Regionalization plays an important role in climatology and hydrology research, as it can be used to understand the changing pattern of a hydroclimate variable better and explore its underlying drivers effectively by identifying homogeneous regions which are determined by topography and climatic conditions. However, as climatic drivers change over time, homogeneous regions should vary when the intra-annual patterns are of interest. In this paper we investigate the regionalization and changing patterns of maximum daily temperature in China based on the maximum air temperature (Tmax) derived from the CN05.1 daily surface air temperature gridded data from 1981 to 2010. We also propose an objective variable-based regionalization approach by combining the rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF) method and K-means clustering analysis, to determine homogeneous regions effectively for such a large volume of daily grid data. The REOF approach is not able to identify discrete regional boundaries easily, but it is efficient at determining the number of regions and their rough spatial location. Furthermore, while clustering analysis suffers from convergence when the number of observations is large, it is able to provide clean boundaries between regions. The hybrid method tends to overcome their individual disadvantages while maintaining their individual advantages. The results show that the patterns of homogeneous regions have distinct features in both summer and winter seasons. The reasonableness of regionalization is then examined by the first principal component within regions, which shows the homogeneity within regions, and the scatterplots of Tmax time series between regions, which show the heterogeneity between regions. Furthermore, the boxplots of normalized Tmax within regions for both summer and winter seasons also clearly show the different characteristics of inter-annual variability in each region. In order to reveal detailed process of the change in the number and pattern of regions, we further conducted the regionalization for individual months and explored the potential linkages between regionalization and climatic conditions over time. This research is noteworthy in promoting research on regionalization with consideration of seasonal and intra-annual variation as well as extreme temperature events. The proposed hybrid regionalization method is broadly applicable to other regionalization studies.

AB The standard ensemble data assimilation schemes often violate the dynamical balances of hydrological models, in particular, the fundamental water balance equation, which relates water storage and water flux changes. The present study aims at extending the recently introduced Weak Constrained Ensemble Kalman Filter (WCEnKF) to a more general framework, namely unsupervised WCEnKF (UWCEnKF), in which the covariance of the water balance model is no longer known, thus requiring its estimation along with the model state variables. This extension is introduced because WCEnKF was found to be strongly sensitive to the (manual) choice of this covariance. The proposed UWCEnKF, on the other hand, provides a more general unsupervised framework that does not impose any (manual, thus heuristic) value of this covariance, but suggests an estimation of it, from the observations, along with the state. The new approach is tested based on numerical experiments of assimilating Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and remotely sensed soil moisture data into a hydrological model. The experiments are conducted over different river basins, comparing WCEnKF, UWCEnKF, and the standard EnKF. In this setup, the UWCEnKF constrains the system state variables with TWS changes, precipitation, evaporation, and discharge data to balance the summation of water storage simulations. In-situ groundwater and soil moisture measurements are used to validate the results of the UWCEnKF and to evaluate its performances against the EnKF. Our numerical results clearly suggest that the proposed framework provides more accurate estimates of groundwater storage changes and soil moisture than WCEnKF and EnKF over the different studied basins.

AB Bayesian inference provides a mathematically elegant and robust approach to constrain numerical model predictions with system knowledge and observations. Technical challenges, such as evaluating a large number of models with long runtimes, have restricted the application of Bayesian inference to groundwater modeling. To overcome such technical challenges, we use Gaussian process emulators to replace a transient regional groundwater MODFLOW model for computing objective functions during model constraining. The regional model is designed to assess the potential impact of a proposed coal seam gas (CSG) development on groundwater levels in the Richmond River catchment, Clarence-Moreton Basin, Australia. The emulators were trained using 4000 snapshots derived from the MODFLOW model and subsequently used to replace the MODFLOW model in an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) scheme. ABC was deemed the more appropriate choice as it relaxes the need to derive an explicit likelihood function that the formal Bayesian analysis requires. The study demonstrated the flexibility of the Gaussian process emulators, which can accurately reproduce the original model behavior at a fraction of the computational cost (from hours to seconds). The gain in computational efficiency using the proposed approach allows the global calibration and uncertainty algorithms to become more feasible for computationally demanding groundwater models. Based on the ABC analysis, the probability for the simulated CSG development causing a water table change of more than 0.2 m was less than 5%. In addition to a probabilistic estimate of the prediction, an added value of emulator-assisted ABC inference is providing information on the extent to which observations can constrain parameters and predictions, as well as the flexibility to include various quantitative and qualitative parameter constraining information.

AB Prediction of soil moisture is critical for water resources management. With Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites by NASA, spatio-temporal interrelation between rainfall and soil moisture fields (at different extents) will be of great value for satellite product calibration/ validation and other hydrologic science investigations. In this study, we explored a non-parametric evolutionary algorithm for prediction of soil moisture from a time series of spatially-distributed rainfall across multiple weather locations under two different hydro-climatic regions. A new genetic algorithm-based hidden Markov model (HMMGA) was developed to estimate long-term soil moisture dynamics at different soil depths using precipitation data as a proxy. Also, we tested transposability of our approach across time under different climatic conditions. To test the new approach, we selected two different soil moisture fields, Oklahoma (130 km x 130 km) and Illinois (300 km x 500 km), during 1995-2009 and 1994-2010, respectively. We found that the newly developed framework performed well in predicting soil moisture dynamics at different spatial extents. Although our approach has limitations in predicting daily values, it estimates well the weekly soil moisture across the spatial and temporal domains with predictable uncertainties. Furthermore, this approach could provide advantages for good transposability under different weather conditions compared to those of physically-based hydrological models. Overall, our suggested approach could predict weekly soil moisture estimates with precipitation and soil moisture histories and showed the potential of transposability under different weather and land surface conditions. Since the proposed algorithm requires only precipitation (and historical soil moisture data) from existing, established weather stations, it can serve an attractive alternative that can forecast soil moisture using climate change scenarios.

AB Sulphur Springs Cave is an extensive phreatic cavity that produces a large, historic spring in the middle of metropolitan Tampa, Florida, USA. The city of Tampa extracts groundwater from the spring to supplement municipal water supply and to support low-salinity habitat in the estuarine Hillsborough River. Extraction at this site has occurred for many decades, but has intensified since the early 2000s, rapidly increasing the salinity of the spring and cave water. The purpose of this study was to address the potential sources and mechanisms of saltwater intrusion at this site using historical and current hydrochemical data published in the literature and online by government agencies. We also explored the cave to identify point-sources of intrusion, and collected water and biological samples from inside the cave to identify potential ecosystem impacts of increasing cave salinity. From 1946 to present, Sulphur Springs water shifted from being fresh (specific conductance < 500 mu S cm(-1)) and of calcium-sulfate type to being brackish (specific conductance similar to 5000 mu S cm(-1) and higher) and of sodium-chloride type. We found numerous vents in the cave that issue saline, thermal, sulfidic water and host distinct microbial mat communities. These vents are likely connected to bedrock fractures that provide preferential flow-paths along which confined, deep-sourced saline water enters the freshwater portion of the aquifer, probably originating from the coastal mixing zone. Salinity increased at the spring during dry-season pumping activity and after wet-season recharge events, which likely increased artesian pressure in confined saline aquifer units. Salinization of Sulphur Springs may disrupt the cave microbe and stygobite communities and eventually make the spring unsuitable to maintain low-salinity habitat in the Hillsborough River.

AB High level of arsenic-containing groundwater has been used for irrigation purposes for several decades in Asia, leading to fluctuating water table and redox conditions in the unsaturated zone, thereby potentially affecting the mobilization of arsenic in the unsaturated and saturated zones. A field plot experiment was conducted in the arsenic - affected area of the Datong Basin, China to determine the effects of irrigation return flow on the hydrogeochemical behavior of arsenic and iron in the unsaturated zone. High-arsenic groundwater was extracted from a shallow aquifer far from the irrigation site and used as irrigation water. Soil water/shallow groundwater and soil/sediment samples were collected at different depths from the field site during the experiment. Water samples were analyzed to determine hydrochemical properties and arsenic concentrations, and soil/sediment samples were analyzed to determine total iron and arsenic. Infiltration of irrigation water into the unsaturated zone led to fluctuations in the water table, varying redox conditions, and the redistribution of arsenic and iron in the near-surface soil/sediment. Soil/sediment bulk geochemical analysis results indicate obvious increases of arsenic and iron in topsoil after irrigation. Infiltration of irrigation water carrying organic matter, sulfate, and nitrate into the subsurface affects the (bio)geochemistry of the unsaturated and saturated zones, and ultimately the behavior of arsenic and iron. Geochemical modeling results suggest desorption and leaching processes are responsible for the temporal changes of arsenic concentrations in both pore water, groundwater and sediment during irrigation. The results of this study indicate that flood irrigation using arsenic-contaminated groundwater should be controlled and gradually replaced by drip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation or irrigation using non-contaminated water resources to mitigate arsenic accumulation in the unsaturated zone and shallow groundwater.

AB Efficient simulation of rainfall-runoff relationships is one of the most complex problems owing to the high number of interrelated hydrological processes. It is well-known that machine learning models could fail in simulating streamflows from only meteorological variables in the absence of antecedent streamflow values. The main reason for this could be low and lagged relationships between streamflow and meteorological variables. To overcome this inefficiency, for the first time, we developed a simulation framework by coupling a base flow separation method to three machine learning methods. It was demonstrated that separating streamflow into different components such as base flow and surface flow can be useful for improving simulation and forecasting capabilities of machine learning models. We simulated streamflow in four rivers in the United States with Support Vector Regression (SVR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Random Forest (RF) as a function of precipitation (P), temperature (T) and potential evapotranspiration (PET). We concluded that the base flow separation method improved the simulation performances of the machine learning models to a certain degree. Apart from the simulation scheme, we also employed a forecasting scheme by using the antecedent observed discharge values in addition to P, T, and PET. We discussed performances of models in simulation and forecasting of streamflow regarding model types, input structures and catchment dynamics in detail.

AB Evaporation is an essential component in hydrological processes, and accurate estimation of evaporation is of importance for sustainable management of water resources. This study conducted a national-scale assessment of different models for pan evaporation (E-pan) estimation at 178 meteorological stations across different climatic zones of China, including the temperate continental zone (TCZ), temperate monsoon zone (TMZ), mountain plateau zone (MPZ) and subtropical monsoon zone (SMZ). Firstly, three data-driven models, including extreme learning machine (ELM), artificial neural networks optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO-ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA-ANN), were trained with nine input combinations of climatic variables. The performance of the 27 proposed models along with the empirical Stephens and Stewart (SS) and physically-based PenPan models were investigated and compared using relative root mean square error (RRMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) and mean absolute error (MAE). The three statistical indicators were further normalized to global performance indicator (GPI), by which all the evaluated models can be easily ranked. The results showed that the data-driven models with complete inputs generally obtained more accurate E-pan estimation, where the ELM model with full input data provided the best accuracy, with average RRMSE of 12.5%-15.2%, NS of 0.909-0.936 and MAE of 11.7-19.9 mm/m. Air temperature was found to be the most influential parameter to data-driven models, followed by sunshine duration, wind speed and relative humidity. The SS model provided slightly better results in MPZ and TCZ, and slightly less accurate results in SMZ and TMZ, compared with the data-driven models under the same input conditions. Overall, ELM was recommended as the best model for E-pan estimation when all the selected climatic data are available, while temperature-based PSO-ANN is recommended in MPZ and SMZ and temperature-based GA-ANN is recommended in TCZ and TMZ when the other climatic data are missing.

AB The Yellow River subaqueous delta (YRSD), once the most rapid depo-center among river deltas worldwide, has been under the risks of subsidence and degradation due to the new regime of riverine delivery affected by human interventions. Utilizing hydrologic and bathymetric surveying datasets, we examined the latest regime of river input from the perspective of water-sediment relationship, and the responding morphological evolutionary processes of active YRSD over a period of 20 years between 1996 and 2016. Results show that the new discharge regime is strongly interfered by the Water-Sediment Regulation Scheme (WSRS), characterized by a more drastic decline of sediment load than that of water discharge; more harmonious relationship between water and sediment discharges in the lower reach of the river to the sea; coarser sediment delivery and low suspended sediment concentration (SSC). We identified inverse erosion-accretion trends in the subaqueous region: net accretion of 0.15 m/yr in the active Yellow River mouth (AYRM) and severe erosion of - 0.1 m/yr in the Gudong littoral zone (GDLZ). As the primary sink for sediment delivery, AYRM received approximately 68% of sediment delivery during the study period and sedimentation was mainly occurred in the shallower area where water depth was less than 10 m. In addition, recent morphological evolution of AYRM is found to have undergone through four stages, namely: moderate accretion (1996-2002), rapid accretion (2002-2007), reduced accretion (2007-2015) and rapid erosion (2015-2016). The new regime of riverine delivery presents multiple spatiotemporal scales in shaping deltaic morphology. Compared with the previous research, we present the morphological evolution of deltaic system over decadal timescale is strongly influenced by reduction of sediment supply derived from basin-scale human impacts, and the variability of subaqueous portion during the study period is closely related to inter-annual variability of river input. Besides, the building of AYRM is shaped by event-scale WSRS induced-floodwater, and decade-scale change of sediment pathway governed by frequent mouth channel migration. The results show, for the first time, that AYRM has experienced a significant erosion since the implementation of WSRS, with a decline of 99% sediment delivery in 2016 compared to the natural mode during 1950s. The results also indicate that to maintain the erosion-accretion balance of AYRM, an estimation of 41.4-62.3 Mt/yr sediment delivery should be kept. Due to the fluvial regime change from the natural to the highly human-regulated modes, the AYRM, as well as the whole YRSD, is expected to be transforming from the accretion to erosion states.

AB The overarching goal of this study is to intercompare the newly released Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) Version 05 (V05) products with its former Version 04 (VO4) and Version 03 (V03) products and also assess any differences and improvements, with cross-evaluation against the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Version 2.3, Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) Version 2.1 and the dense gauge networks in China. Firstly, the gauge-adjusted products (Final run) of V03, VO4 and V05 are compared over the globe. Then, the near-real-time products without gauge adjustments (Early and Late run) and Final run products of all versions are evaluated against ground-based observations comprised of more than 30,000 gauges over Mainland China at 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees grid and hourly and daily temporal scales. The primary conclusions are: (1) globally, both VO4 and V05 Final run show significant differences and improvements from V03. Particularly, the overall mean oceanic precipitation of VO4 and V05 increases by +31.36% and + 28.81% respectively from that of V03 and much closer to GPCP and MSWEP; (2) over Mainland China, the Early and Late run products of the same version (V03 or VO4) generally have similar performance, while VO4 Early and Late run have better performance in most regions than the corresponding run of V03 except in the arid Xinjiang Province and the mountainous Tibetan Plateau; and (3) VO4 and V03 Final run show comparable performance, while V05 Final run generally improves upon both VO4 and V03 and has the best performance among the seven standard IMERG products. The improvement of V05 Final run is particularly evident in southeastern and western China. At a timely matter, the study provides first-hand global and regional assessment feedback to IMERG algorithm developers and also sheds insights for GPM precipitation product users across the world.

AB Aiming at resolving the numerical problems caused by the improper friction source term treatment when simulating overland flow using 2D shallow water flow models, a proposed implicit method computing the friction source term is developed in this work. The method is able to not only accurately evaluate the tricky thin overland flow by considering the flow velocity varying in a single time step, but also eliminates the redundant iterations for regular implicit approach through converting the implicit scheme to an explicit equation. It is therefore an improved one in terms of accuracy and efficiency comparing to the existing methods. Furthermore, it is an independent part and can be straightforwardly and universally incorporated into any FVM based shallow water flow model. Such performances are validated against three test cases involving theoretical and practical overland flow problems. The results prove the proposed method treating friction source term could simulate overland flow problems in a relatively more accurate and efficient way, and therefore can effectively help extend the applicability of the shallow water models reliably computing both the open channel and overland flows.

AB The permanent wilting point (PWP) is the minimal point of soil moisture a plant requires not to wilt. If moisture decreases to this, or any lower point, a plant wilts, and can no longer recover its turgidity when placed in a saturated atmosphere for 12 h. The PWP is an essential physical property that has a powerful influence on other soil properties and is important for agricultural production, including irrigation water use efficiency and crop yield. However, there are few published datasets on the PWP of cultivated land in the arid and semi-arid regions of Northeast China. Direct measurements of PWP are time-consuming and expensive; therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate how environmental variables could be used in spatial predictions of PWP in an arid and semi-arid region based on boosted regression tree (BRT) and multiple linear stepwise regression (MLSR) analyses. Seventy soil samples and nine covariates (including topography and vegetation variables) were collected and analyzed. Cross-validation procedure was used to evaluate model performance and uncertainty. Accuracy evaluation results showed that the BRT model had better predictive performance than the MLSR. PWP content decreased from the southwest to the northeast of the study area, and average values of both models were 26%. BRT and MLSR models should be compared and calibrated to obtain the best prediction effect of PWP spatial distribution in similar areas. Elevation, slope gradient, profile curvature, topographic wetness index, and landuse variables are the main environmental indicators that should be included when generating PWP maps of regions with a dry, continental climate. Such information could aid local land managers and government agencies with evaluating soil quality and water sequestration potential. In conclusion, this study could be used as a reference for predicting the hydrological parameters of the topsoil in other similar ecological environments.

This study describes evolution of Dalung and Padam glaciers and their associated lakes employing multi-temporal datasets of Landsat (MSS, TM, ETM + ), Indian Remote Sensing LISS-III, Google Earth (TM), ASTER GDEM and Survey of India topographic maps. The Dalung Glacier (DG) and Lake (DL) are present in Suru River catchment whereas the Padam Glacier (PG) and Lake (PL) are present in Tsarap River catchment of Zanskar basin, western Himalaya. From 1962 to 2015; the DG and PG have shrunk at different rates. The DG has shrunk by 2.6 +/- 0.56 km(2) (19.2 +/- 4.1%) at a rate of 0.05 +/- 0.01 km(2) a(-1) whereas, the PG has shrunk by 3.4 +/- 0.65 km(2) (12.7 +/- 2.4%) at a rate of 0.06 +/- 0.01 km(2) a(-1). The frontal recession was recorded as 1.240 +/- 0.02 km (15.7 +/- 2.0%) at a rate of 20 +/- 0.4 m a(-1) for DG and 2.690 +/- 0.5 m (21.3 +/- 2.1%) at a rate of 50.7 +/- 0.1 m a(-1) for PG. Consequently, the proglacial glacial lakes have formed indicating an expansion of 20 +/- 3.4% (DL) and 58 +/- 4.5% (PL) during 1990-2015. Using integrated criteria of standard indices for the identification of potentially dangerous glacial lakes (PDGLs), the lakes were found to be vulnerable and have a potential to cause breaching in the coming years. In order to provide inputs for the emergency action plan, one dimensional MIKE 11 Model was used to generate the peak flood hydrographs at the lake and other vulnerable sites downstream. Highest peak discharge of 3361.7 m(3) s(-1) (DL) and 4210.3 m(3) s(-1) (PL) were estimated at the lake sites which has reduced to 1520.9 m(3) s(-1) and 1722.4 m(3) s(-1) respectively at the outlet sites. The reduced discharge at downstream sites still bears the potential to create dangerous flood hazards.

AB Green roofs are valuable solutions for rain management improvements in urban areas as they can partly store and delay rainfall water. Here, we point out that green roofs cannot be considered as static systems, which performances remain constant over time. This work is based on the cross-use of a lab-scale experiment and a modelling approach to evaluate the hydraulic performances of a green roof substrate over time. Experiments were conducted on new and aged materials, after 30 months of in situ aging. The experimental device was designed and implemented to simulate irrigation or rainfall and accurately monitor hydraulic fluxes. An estimation of hydraulic parameters was obtained by using inverse modelling of experimental data with HYDRUS-1D software. Comparisons between measured and modelled data demonstrated the reliability of the model for simulating the hydraulic behavior of the green roofs. Considering an incoming water event - which mimics a heavy rainfall - of 43 mm h(-1) and similar water content initial conditions, our simulations indicate that the retention capacity and the delay effect were always higher for the new substrate than for the aged one. Both of these performance indicators strongly vary with the initial water content of the substrates. Whereas the relation is linear for the retention capacity ranging from 100% of retention for the drier conditions to 0% for the saturated substrates, it is more complex for the delay effect. Such performances were comparable to analogous data from the existing literature. Furthermore, this comparison confirmed that green roofs are submitted to an early aging in terms of structure, i.e. porosity. In our study, the aged substrate presented less favorable performances thus highlighting the key role of the composition of green roof substrate not only on the initial performances but also on their sustainability.

AB Globally, water quality degradation severely threatens the security of water resources. Understanding a river's capacity to accommodate pollutants (or water environmental capacity: WEC) can help efficiently protect rivers. However, the requirement for comprehensive ground-observed hydrological and water quality data in previous methods makes it difficult to estimate WEC in areas with limited ground observations. This paper proposes a new framework for WEC estimation in data-scarce areas based on remotely sensed skin water temperature and limited ground observations. Two new models were developed to calculate the two critical parameters for WEC estimation: water temperature, and integrated pollutant degradation coefficients (k). Images of ASTER Surface Kinetic Temperature (AST 08) 90 m grid product were used to retrieve water temperatures. The above results were subsequently used to calculate a river's capacity to accommodate pollutants, or WEC, in agriculturally dominated areas. The use of remote sensing techniques enables the methods to be applied over large spatial scales and to areas with limited ground observations. The application and testing of the framework in four rivers, including two Chinese rivers (the Huai and the Wei Rivers) and two Australian rivers (the Ovens and the Gwydir Rivers), suggest that the models performed well to calculate the real-time water temperature and the coefficient k based on limited ground-observations. Uncertainty analysis on water temperature calculated from remotely sensed land surface temperature and ground-observed meteorological air temperature suggests that remotely sensed water temperature had high concurrence with ground observations (RMSE = 3.08 degrees C with R-2 = 0.88), while the sparse-spatially distributed meteorological stations reduced the accuracy in estimating water temperature (RMSE = 4.39 degrees C with R-2 = 0.91). We found that the coefficient (k) increased with water temperature over different seasons in an exponential form but in a logarithmical form with streamflow velocity. Comparison with previous research and other models with abundant data revealed the practicability and effectiveness of our models, which can be easily applied to rivers with insufficient ground observations across the globe.

AB Various types of regionalization approaches have been proposed in the last several decades for predictions in ungauged basins. The most commonly used methods are based on the proximity of catchment centroids and physiographic and/or climatic conditions of the catchments. However, the proximity of the catchment centroids and catchment physical attributes do not necessarily translate into similarities in hydrologic behavior. It is also difficult to identify the key attributes that favor hydrologic similarity. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a new method called catchment runoff-response similarity (CRRS), in the view of reducing the hydrologic process predictive uncertainty and to solve the problem of the key attributes identification that favor hydrologic similarity. The CRRS has a two-step approach: 1) the commonly used regionalization approach is used to temporarily transpose the calibrated model parameter from gauged to ungauged catchments, and 2) the runoff response of each smaller delineated subbasin of the gauged and ungauged basins are obtained based on the parameter value computed in the first step. The similar subbasins of the gauged and ungauged basins are then identified based on their runoff response similarity. The final parameter value in the ungauged subbasins are determined based on the notion that similar subbasins with runoff responses to similar input rainfall could have similar model structure settings. The applicability of the proposed approach was verified for the Geum River Basin (GRB) of South Korea and the Lake Tana Basin (LTB) of Ethiopia. Leave-one-out evaluations of the proposed parameter transfer approach at various test-gauging stations showed that the CRRS approach outperformed the other widely used methods. The CRRS in the GRB and LTB, reached 91% and 77% during the calibration and 86% and 67% during the validation period, respectively, of the at-site calibrated model performance on average over the test stations. The overall worth of the CRRS over the second best commonly used regionalization approach were also found to be 10% and 14% during the calibration and 7% and 4% during the validation period in the GRB and LTB, respectively. In general, it can be concluded from the overall result that the runoff predictive uncertainty in the ungauged catchments of the two study basins was significantly reduced by the CRRS approach. Therefore, the proposed approach can be used as an alternative method for runoff prediction in the ungauged basins worldwide.

AB A double-sided stochastic chance-constrained linear fractional programming (DSCLFP) model is developed for managing irrigation water under uncertainty. The model is developed by incorporating double-sided stochastic chance-constrained programming (DSCCP) into a linear fractional programming (LFP) optimization framework. It can address ratio optimization problems with double-sided randomness (i.e. both left-hand and right-hand sides). More importantly, it also improves upon the existing stochastic chance-constrained programming for handing random uncertainties in the left-hand and right-hand sides of constraints simultaneously. A non-equivalent but sufficient linearization form of the DSCLFP is provided and proved, which will greatly reduce the computational burden. Then, the model is applied to a case study in Yingke Irrigation District (YID) in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin, northwest China. Four confidence levels (e.g. alpha = 0.85, 0.90, 0.95 and 0.99) are provided to examine and compare the results. The objective function values are slightly decreased from 5.284 Yuan/m(3) to 5.276 Yuan/m(3) when alpha(i) level is raised from 0.85 to 0.99. The results from the DSCLFP can identify desired irrigation water allocation plans under the objective function of maximizing water productivity under different confidence levels. Therefore, the results can provide tradeoffs among water productivity, confidence level and constraint-violation risk level. Moreover, comparisons with double-sided stochastic chance-constrained linear programming (DSCLP) model and deterministic model are introduced to highlight advantages and feasibility of the developed model. Therefore, these results can provide decision-support for managers in arid areas.

AB Recently, a combination of model predictive control and a reduced genetic algorithm (RGA-MPC) has shown to be an efficient control technique for real-time flood control, making use of fast conceptual river models. This technique was so far only tested under ideal circumstances of perfect model predictions. Prediction errors originating from hydrodynamic model mismatches, however, result in a deterioration of the real-time control performance. Therefore, this paper presents two extensions of the RGA-MPC technique. First, a new type of conceptual model is introduced to further increase the computational efficiency. This reduced conceptual model is specially tailored for real-time flood control applications by eliminating all unnecessary intermediate calculations to obtain the flood control objectives and by introducing a new transport element by means of flow matrices. Furthermore, the RGA-MPC technique is extended with a flexible data assimilation approach that analyzes the past observed errors and applies an appropriate error prediction scheme. The proposed approach largely compensates for the loss in control performance due to the hydrodynamic model uncertainty.

AB Water movement in hillslopes is determined by the subsurface characteristics that control flow paths connecting precipitation to stream flow. The hydrological response of hillslopes is notoriously non-linear and non-stationary; with the relative importance of vertical and lateral flow paths also depending on event characteristics and antecedent conditions. In northern boreal regions, climate change projections indicate that wetter and warmer winter conditions are likely to generate more extreme flood events. Here, we report a study from an upland catchment in northern Scotland where a monitoring year provided an opportunity to contextualise observations during the hillslope response to a winter rainfall event that locally caused the most extreme flooding for over 200 years. Monitoring the hillslope water table, soil moisture and isotopes in precipitation, groundwater and stream flow provided invaluable insight into hillslope-riparian coupling. Groundwater with a shallow water table ( < 0.05 m deep) in poorly drained valley bottom drift deposits maintained almost fully saturated and stream-connected peat soil profiles in riparian areas. In the wettest periods, the groundwater beneath the peat was artesian. On steeper hillslopes, soils were drier and the water table was generally deeper (0.5-1 m below ground level), though the profile could fully saturate and groundwater levels reach the surface during the wettest period. Groundwater in deeper wells typically showed an anti-clockwise hysteresis compared to stream flow, and peak levels typically lagged behind the stream by a few hours in the valley bottom and > 1 day in the upper hillslope. In contrast, shallower wells in the soil profiles in the riparian area showed a more responsive perched groundwater system with transmissivity feedback in the upper soil layers resulting in much more rapid responses which generally peaked before the stream and exhibited clockwise hysteresis. Analysis of stable isotopes in precipitation, groundwater and streamflow, indicated that groundwater was remarkably well mixed with limited fractionation effects, inferring precipitation on the upper, unconfined hillslopes was the dominant source of recharge - particularly during the winter. The study shows that groundwater plays two roles in generating stream flow: a constant baseflow supply to the stream and time varying-exfiltration into the edge of the riparian zone, which contributes to surface runoff during storm events.

AB In this work, we have used the Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to examine streamflow variability of the Lower Mekong River Basin (LMRB) associated with changes in the Upper Mekong River Basin (UMRB) inflows. Two hypothetical experiments were formulated and evaluated for the LMRB, where we conducted runoff simulations with multiple inflow changes that include upstream runoff yield increase and decrease scenarios. Streamflow variability of the LMRB was quantified by two streamflow metrics that explain flow variability and predictability, and high flow disturbance. The model experiments were performed for the Lower Mekong River Basin with identical climate, soil, and other watershed characteristics data. Remote sensing precipitation (Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission, TRMM, and Global Precipitation Measurement mission, GPM), meteorological data as well as spatial data that include a digital elevation model, newly developed soil information (Harmonized World Soil Database, HWSD), and land use and land cover were processed as input to the LMRB model simulations. Observed daily streamflow data along the Lower Mekong River from Chiang Sean, Thailand to Kratie, Cambodia were used for calibration and validation. Our work results suggest that the Lower Mekong River streamflow is highly variable and has a low predictability (Colwell index of about 32%). We found that releasing more water from upstream Mekong during rainfall months by 30% would result in a reduction in the Lower Mekong streamflow predictability by about 21%. This reduction in predictability is mainly attributed to a decrease in the Contingency index. Our work shows that the ability to predict floods/droughts at the Lower Mekong River would be reduced if there is any anticipated change (i.e., increase/decrease) from UMRB releases. Our results also show that releasing more flows from the upstream Mekong would also affect flood duration and the frequency of flood occurrences downstream. The results of this work thus help to quantify the sensitivity of streamflow variability at the Lower Mekong River Basin to upstream anthropogenic changes.

AB Tidal asymmetry in deltas is caused by both the intrinsic asymmetry, resulting from the combination of astronomical tides, and by nonlinear tidal interactions that occur in shallow water. The relative importance of these sources of tidal asymmetry in delta channel networks have remained poorly studied, partly due to the limitations of classical harmonic analysis (HA) in hindcasting nonstationary tides. The Pearl River Delta (PRD) is a multichannel system with rapidly changing bathymetry, subject to severe human interventions. This work applies a nonstationary harmonic model (NS_TIDE) to hydrological data from 15 stations in the PRD spanning the period 1961-2012. The spatiotemporal variation of multiple sources of tidal asymmetry is quantified by a skewness metric, revealing how similar or dissimilar the development of alternative sources of tidal asymmetry develop in the delta subject to study. A relative sensitivity coefficient (RSC) is introduced to decompose the contribution of tidal amplitude variations to multiple tidal asymmetries. Analytical results show the development of tides becoming gradually more asymmetric as they propagate into delta channel networks, and how this depends on the river flow. Variation in the orientation of tidal asymmetries induced by different combinations of tidal constituents leads to a complex pattern of the overall tidal asymmetry in the PRD. Our results show that tidal asymmetry in deltas can be significantly dependent on the river flow.

AB The study aims to examine the effect of ponds on changes in water quality in a young glacial river catchment. The goal was to identify situations where a periodic hydrographic network is formed in outflow-free areas, which is connected with a higher order receiving area, as well as to study the circulation of matter in this type of system. This study answers the following key question: Do ponds affected by areal pollution substantially affect water quality in streams in periods where they become joined with the hydrographic network? The purpose of the research was to identify patterns associated with the functioning of ponds in young glacial areas in northern Poland on the example of the Borucinka catchment. Ponds were selected in order to generate a study sample characterized by different types of land use, local hydrology, and pond surface area. The study focused on the effects of catchment land use on pond water quality and the effects of periodic changes in local hydrology (linkage of surface flows with bodies of water) on pond water quality. Research has shown that land use in a pond catchment yields a substantial effect on pond water quality. The basic reason for the higher concentration of selected ions is close proximity to farms that generate wastewater, which reaches bodies of water in the study area. Seasonal changes in the concentration of biogenic substances were not observed in ponds. Only notable changes in the concentration of total nitrogen were observed due the episodic formation of a hydrographic network consisting of a collection of linked depressions. One of the more surprising findings was that permanently isolated ponds, which theoretically collect catchment pollutants all the time, are characterized by good hydrochemical conditions.

AB Potential influences of climate change on water quality, riverine suspended sediments, nitrogen and organic matter loads in temporally frozen rivers, which have ice-covered flow and snow-affected basins, are poorly understood. However, before being able to understand potential future changes, the impact of ice and snow needs to be investigated more thoroughly for years which were hydrologically different. We investigated seasonal and event scale concentration-discharge (C-Q) dynamics of total suspended solids/turbidity, nitrate-N (NO3-N) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), which is indicative of the amount of organic matter in river water. In particular, the influence of ice cover, contrasting spring thaw, and soil frost conditions on infra-annual fluxes and the C-Q response of the three solutes are detected based on over four years of hourly data. Seasonally flow-weighted suspended solids and NO3-N concentrations were at their highest in either the autumn or spring thaw, but COD concentrations were the highest each year in autumn. NO3-N and COD levels typically decreased during winter. The ice-covered river water was less turbid compared to open-channel water at an equivalent river discharge likely due to in-stream factors. Storms during the freshet period introduced flushing of organic matter and suspended solids. The ratio of organic matter yield to water yield was similar each freshet and was independent of the amount of precipitation as snow or soil frost status. The freshet NO3-N yield per water yield was higher during the years with a thick snowpack and the consequent thawed soil compared to a year with soil frost and minor snowpack. 91 storm events studied revealed differences and similarities in storm dynamics in between the three variables. Anti-clockwise hysteresis was most common for the variables, with turbidity peaking faster than the COD or NO3-N concentration in most of the storms. Snowmelt storms showed highly variable C-Q responses inbetween the variables. However, spring thaw-related COD concentration peaks abated more slowly compared to turbidity or NO3-N. NO3-N showed a strong dilution pattern during several autumn storms during an extremely wet year, indicating limited N sources for flushing from the catchment. As a result, the flow-weighted mean NO3-N concentration was not the largest during the year of largest water yield instead which was true for suspended solids and COD. We found no evidence that wanner winters with precipitation as rain instead of snow would increase suspended sediment, organic matter and NO3-N load at entire winter-spring season or annual timescales.

AB A comprehensive framework composed of stormwater indices (e.g., stormwater runoff, runoff pollution) and anthropogenic heat is proposed to facilitate selection of key areas for sponge-like urban reconstruction based on the integration of emergy analysis and GIS models. A case study in Shenzhen is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in aiding the implementation of sponge city reconstruction. Specifically, natural and man-made releases are identified and accounted for in emergy units (seJ). When compared to the emergy values of natural releases (4.99E + 14-7.59E +14 seJ) and man-made releases (1.79E + 14-5.8E +16 seJ) within the Shenzhen Basic Ecological Control Line (designated as an ecological preservation area), the emergy values of both types of releases outside the Basic Ecological Control Line are higher, ranging from 7.59E+ 14 seJ to 8.32E +14 seJ for the former and from 5.8E +16 seJ to 1.86E + 17 seJ for the latter. Nine sub-districts in Shenzhen, China, such as industrial parks, transportation and bare land for construction are preliminarily chosen as areas for potential sponge-like urban reconstruction on the basis of man-made releases, and are then confirmed by examining natural releases. The proposed emergy-GIS framework can bridge the gap between empirical studies and standardize research to ensure that the results of the green infrastructure plan live up to the rhetoric.

AB Plastic mulching has been widely used in arid regions because it can decrease soil water evaporation and raise soil temperature. Previous studies, however, treated soil water evaporation under plastic mulch to be negligible, assuming that the plastic mulch can prevent water exchange between soil and atmosphere completely. In order to demonstrate validity of this assumption, experiments were conducted from 2014 to 2016 under irrigated maize (Zea mays) field in Northwest China, comparison experiments of soil water evaporation between mulched soil and the bare soil between mulches were carried out in two seed maize fields with different irrigation method, i.e. border irrigation under mulch (Site BM) and drip irrigation under mulch (Site DM), with micro-lysimeters placed under the plastic mulched soil and the bare soil between mulches to evaluate soil water evaporation of each experiment maize field. Our observations indicated that the soil water evaporation under plastic mulch (E-ms) was about 4.04-7.07% of the total evapotranspiration, among which E-ms in the daytime accounted for 3.58-5.37% of the total evapotranspiration and 0.99-2.10% of the total evapotranspiration in the nighttime. Thus E-ms was considered not to be negligible. For two experiment sites, soil water evaporation under bare soil between mulches (E-bs) was obviously higher than the soil water evaporation under plastic mulch (E-ms) in daytime, but the former was lower than the latter in the nighttime. At night, the mean soil temperature in the mulched soil was higher than that in the bare soil because of the warming effect of the plastic mulch. A soilmulch-canopy-atmosphere model is used to consider the effects of the mulch, and the modeling results further support this finding. These results provide a new insight for understanding the effect of plastic mulch on water use efficiency.

AB Brinkman's model is one of the common mathematical formulations used in modeling fluid flow in karst aquifers. The Brinkman's model is a hybrid formulation that allows the use of a single transport equation to model fluid flow in both the free-flow and porous regions of a karst aquifer, by transitioning between the Stokes equation and the Darcy's law. However, the Brinkman's model is computationally expensive, requiring the solution of four different equations to obtain the pressures and velocities in a three-dimensional aquifer. Darcy's model provides a cheaper alternative, because it allows the substitution of the Darcy's equation into the mass conservation equation and thus requires the solution of only one parabolic equation. However, while the Darcy's model produces accurate results within the porous medium, it fails to provide satisfactory results in the free-flow regions of the karst aquifers. We propose a sector modeling approach to model fluid flow in karst aquifers. The sector modeling approach takes advantage of both the computational inexpensiveness of the Darcy's model and the accuracy of Brinkman's model in the caves. This method was compared to the Brinkman's model and the Darcy's model. Three examples are presented to study the effectiveness of the sector modeling technique. The first example is a simple model consisting of a straight conduit surrounded by porous regimes on either side while the second and third examples are more complicated structures consisting of complex geometrical caves embedded in a highly heterogeneous porous medium. Results show that the sector modeling approach provides an excellent match to the Brinkman's model and with much faster computations. Specifically, sector modeling was 4.6 times faster than the Brinkman's model in the first example, 13 times faster in the second; and 25 times faster in the third example. We also observed negligible deterioration in accuracy of results from sector modeling when the size of the extracted sector relative to the full-field is reduced.

AB Quantifying and reducing uncertainties in physics-based hydrological model parameters will improve model reliability for hydrological forecasting. We present an uncertainty quantification framework that combines the strengths of stepwise sensitivity analysis and adaptive surrogate-based multi-objective optimization to facilitate practical assessment and reduction of model parametric uncertainties. Framework performance was tested using the distributed hydrological model Coupled Routing and Excess Storage (CREST) for daily streamflow simulation over ten watersheds. By identifying sensitive parameters stepwisely, we reduced the number of parameters requiring calibration from twelve to seven, thus limiting the dimensionality of calibration problem. By updating surrogate models adaptively, we found the optimal sets of sensitive parameters with the surrogate-based multiobjective optimization. The calibrated CREST was able to satisfactorily simulate observed streamflow for all watersheds, improving one minus Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (1 -NSE) by 65-90% and percentage absolute relative bias (vertical bar RB vertical bar) by 60-95% compared to the default. The validation result demonstrated that the calibrated CREST was also able to reproduce observed streamflow outside the calibration period, improving 1 - NSE by 40-85% and (vertical bar RB vertical bar) by 35-90% compared to the default. Overall, this uncertainty quantification framework is effective for assessment and reduction of model parametric uncertainties, the results of which improve model simulations and enhance understanding of model behaviors.

AB Land-use change and climate variability have the potential to alter river flow and groundwater resources dramatically, especially by modifying actual evapotranspiration. Seven catchments with intermittent flow dominated by either winter-active perennial pastures (4 catchments) or Eucalyptus globulus plantations (3 catchments), located in 3 geologic settings of southeastern Australia, were studied for over 6 years to determine the primary controls on water resources. Groundwater levels in the pasture sites were stable through the 2011-2016 study period, while levels in the plantations declined in the same period. Streamflow occurred mainly during winter. Annual streamflow showed no difference clearly attributable to pasture versus plantation land use. The presence of grass buffers along streams enhances groundwater recharge and saturation-dependent overland flow, reducing the impacts of the plantations on streamflow. Site water balances indicated that the average annual actual evapotranspiration was 87-93% of precipitation for pasture catchments and 102-108% of precipitation for plantation catchments. Actual evapotranspiration greater than precipitation at the plantations was attributed to uptake of groundwater by the root system in parts of the catchments. Thus, change to groundwater storage is a critical component in the water balance. Actual evapotranspiration from pasture catchments was higher than previously estimated from global pasture and cropping data, instead matching global precipitation versus actual evapotranspiration curves for treed catchments.

AB The Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) is the world's largest hydrological project. However, the response of thallium (Tl) in TGR sediments to reservoir operation remains highly uncertain. Here, we investigated the pollution characteristics of Tl in TGR sediments during five consecutive water seasons. Geochemical baseline concentrations (GBCs) were used to distinguish the anthropogenic input of Tl and to quantitatively estimate the Tl anthropogenic contribution in TGR sediments. The results showed that the average Tl concentration in TGR sediments was 0.72 +/- 0.14 mg/kg (ranging from 0.26 to 1.07 mg/kg) during five consecutive water seasons. The average Tl content in tributary sediment was higher than that in mainstream sediment. In the mainstream, Tl in TGR sediments showed an accumulation tendency from the upstream to downstream. Additionally, the temporal variation revealed that the mean value of Tl in TGR sediments in the dry season was higher than that in the wet season during 2015-2016. Furthermore, the average GBCs of Tl (0.71 mg/kg) was higher than background values (BVs) in the Yangtze River sediments. Using the GBCs of different water seasons to calculate the anthropogenic input of Tl in the TGR, the average anthropogenic contribution was found to be approximately 6.43% (2.81%-9.12%). The assessment results by two different methods (geo-accumulation index and potential ecological risk index) used GBCs as the BVs, indicating that TGR sediments were at "uncontaminated" level and close to the "low ecological risk", respectively. Comparing to the GBC of Tl, the assessment of Tl pollution in TGR using BVs in the Yangtze River sediments may be over-evaluated. This study is beneficial for assessing Tl pollution in TGR sediments response to consecutive water seasons and estimating the anthropogenic contribution of Tl.

AB Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K) of surface soil changes substantially with space and time, and it is of great importance for many ecological, agricultural, and hydrological applications. In general, K is measured in the laboratory, or more commonly, predicted using soil water retention curve and saturated hydraulic conductivity. In the field, K can be determined through infiltration experiments. However, none of these approaches are capable of continuously monitoring K in-situ at fine depth scales. In this study, we propose and investigate an approach to continuously estimate fine depth-scale K dynamics under field conditions. Evaporation rate and change in water storage in a near-surface soil layer are measured with the heat pulse method. Then, water flux density at the lower boundary of the soil layer is estimated from evaporation rate, change in water storage, and rainfall or irrigation rate using a simple water balance approach. Finally, K values at different soil depths are derived using the Buckingham-Darcy equation from water flux densities and measured water potential gradients. A field experiment is performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. K values at 2-, 4-, 7.5-, and 12.5-cm depths are estimated with the new approach. The results show that in-situ K estimates vary with time following changes in soil water content, and the K-water content relationship changes with depth due to the difference in bulk density. In-situ estimated K-matric potential curves agree well with those measured in the laboratory. In-situ K estimates also show good agreement with the Mualem-van Genuchten model predictions, with an average root mean square error in log(10) (K, mm h(-1)) of 0.54 and an average bias of 0.17. The new approach provides reasonable in-situ K estimates and has potential to reveal the influences of natural soil conditions on hydraulic properties as they change with depth and time.

AB To improve the behavioural realism of a water resource model, this study coupled hydrologic modelling with stated preference research, thereby incorporating an empirical estimate of behavioural parameters to represent residents' landscape decisions in an urban environment. The stated preference data came from a discrete choice experiment in which residents were asked to choose among several possible lawn plots - varying in size, turf variety, and aesthetic qualities. The discrete choice experiment also included subsidies for lawn replacement, and information about estimated water use and watering costs for each lawn choice. We prepared a behavioural model utilizing coefficients from a mixed logic model estimated from the stated preference data, and then coupled it with a water resources model of the Okanagan Basin using the Water Evaluation and Planning System. We then conducted a scenario analysis using the coupled socio-hydrological model to simulate the extent to which residents would adopt alternative lawns under varying incentives and subsequently computed corresponding changes in water demand. The results indicate that proposing alternative lawn configurations to residents and providing site-specific information about the potential for reduced watering costs, along with a small subsidy, could lead to considerable reduction of outdoor water use through voluntary adoption. Under a scenario in which the attributes of the suggested lawn configuration matched those most preferred by residents in the choice experiment, the suggested configuration was widely adopted in the Okanagan, but a scenario with a more extreme water conserving lawn configuration reduced overall outdoor water use by a greater amount even though the configuration was adopted by a smaller percentage of residents. This study illustrates the relationship between lawn preferences and water use and supports calls to integrate hydrological and social modelling in order to capture the complex interactions between human behaviour and water use.

AB Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is a promising proximal soil sensing technique to estimate soil moisture at intermediate scale and high temporal resolution. However, the signal shows complex and non-unique response to all hydrogen pools near the land surface, providing some challenges for soil moisture estimation in practical applications. Aims of the study were 1) to assess the uncertainty of CRNS as a stand-alone approach to estimate volumetric soil moisture in cropped field 2) to identify the causes of this uncertainty 3) and possible improvements. Two experimental sites in Germany were equipped with a CRNS probe and point-scale soil moisture network. Additional monitoring activities were conducted during the crop growing season to characterize the soil-plant systems. This data is used to identify and quantify the different sources of uncertainty (factors). An uncertainty analysis, based on Monte Carlo approach, is applied to propagate these uncertainties to CRNS soil moisture estimations. In addition, a sensitivity analysis based on the Sobol' method is performed to identify the most important factors explaining this uncertainty. Results show that CRNS soil moisture compares well to the soil moisture network when these point-scale values are weighted to account for the spatial sensitivity of the signal and other sources of hydrogen (lattice water and organic carbon) are added to the water content. However, the performance decreases when CRNS is considered as a stand-alone method to retrieve the actual (non-weighted) volumetric soil moisture. The support volume (penetration depth and radius) shows also a considerable uncertainty, especially in relatively dry soil moisture conditions. Four of the seven factors analyzed (the vertical soil moisture profile, bulk density, incoming neutron correction and the calibrated parameter N o ) were found to play an important role. Among the possible improvements identified, a simple correction factor based on vertical point-scale soil moisture profiles shows to be a promising approach to account for the sensitivity of the CRNS signal to the upper soil layers.

AB The sediment delivery ratio (SDR) is a bond of slope erosion and channel sediment transport but exhibits poor dynamic applicability, which makes it difficult to accurately identify the spatio-temporal evolutions of sediment yield in an ecological restoration watershed with different governance degrees. i) An innovative piecewise SDR algorithm considering the multi-stage effects of the comprehensive governance degree from 1991 to 2013 was embedded in a dynamic sediment yield model to solve the complex dynamic applicability problem of the SDR in sediment yield predictions. ii) The main advantages of the improved SDR algorithm over the existing models are small data requirements, dynamic mechanism, wide application range, reduced complexity, ease of use and better accuracy. iii) The erosion intensities of sloping farmland and orchards in the Yangou River watershed were both intensive at the early stage of governance in 1997. The trends in erosion and sediment yield were closely related to the watershed management measures. The soil erosion modulus in this watershed decreased from 5657 t/km(2) in 1997 to 906.2 t/km(2) in 2012, a total decrease rate of 84%. The sediment yield modulus decreased from 4500 t/km(2) in 1997 to 51.9 t/km(2) in 2012, a total reduction rate of 98.8%. iv) The annual dynamics of the SDR values were not completely affected by the random fluctuations in rainfall erosivity but showed an obvious decreasing trend from 0.932 in 1992 to 0.057 in 2012 due to the soil conservation measures. The annual average SDR in 1991-2013 was approximately 0.38, indicating that the average sediment yield after ecological restoration was significantly less than the average soil erosion in the Yangou River watershed. The results of this study may provide a better understanding of dynamic SDR studies and reveal the profound insights needed to guide watershed soil conservation planning.

AB High-resolution gridded precipitation products are rare globally, particularly below a daily time-step, yet many hydrological applications require, or can be improved by, a higher temporal resolution of rainfall data. Here, we present a new 1 km resolution gridded hourly rainfall dataset for Great Britain (Gridded estimates of hourly areal rainfall for Great Britain (1990-2014) [CEH-GEAR1hr]) using data from over 1900 quality controlled rainfall gauges, which improves upon the current UK national gridded precipitation datasets at daily time-step. We extend and automate a quality control (QC) procedure to permit the use of hourly data for 1990-2014 and independently validate the QC using daily rainfall data and recorded historic events. Our two-tiered validation approach, at daily and hourly timescales, indicates that spurious extreme values are excluded from the resultant dataset, while legitimate values are preserved. We use a nearest neighbour interpolation scheme to derive gridded hourly rainfall values at 1 km resolution, to temporally disaggregate the CEH-GEAR daily gridded dataset and produce an hourly dataset with consistent daily totals. This provides a unique resource for hydrological applications in Great Britain. The CEH-GEAR1hr dataset, associated metadata and QC information, will be freely available from the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) and hosted alongside the daily and monthly CEH-GEAR product.

AB Most hydrological models simulate snowmelt using a degree day or simplified energy balance method, which usually requires a calibration of snow-related parameters using discharge data. Despite its apparent efficiency, this method leads to empirical relations which are not proven to remain valid in a changing climate. The direct application of robust physically-based snow models in hydrological modeling is difficult due to the high number of not easily available input variables this model type requires. The objective of this study is to test the robustness of a physically-based snowpack model that requires only a limited number of common meteorological parameters. The MASiN model computes the energy and mass balance of multiple layers of the snowpack using hourly air temperature, relative humidity and wind speeds, as well as daily precipitations. MASiN was tested at 23 sites across Canada and Sweden, using a unique set of parameters fixed at a single site. At each site, the snow depth simulated by MASiN was compared against measurements. Robustness was challenged by comparing MASiN's performance to that of three other models on three different criteria. MASiN showed the highest robustness among the tested models. With a unique set of parameters, it showed better results than the three reference models when used in similar conditions and matched their performances when reference models were calibrated at each site. The results prove non-data intensive physically based models to be promising tools for hydrological and other snow cover-related studies.

AB With rapid urbanization, rainstorm-induced inundation losses are becoming increasingly severe. Research on urban inundation response to rainstorm patterns can help engineers and governments make appropriate decisions and mitigate property losses. This paper introduces a new hydrodynamic model that couples the storm water management model (SWMM) and the shallow water model (SWM) and applies the validated model to the Haidian Island case to determine the inundation response to rainstorm patterns. The results show that the coupled model can predict rainstorm-induced inundation well, and that different rainstorm patterns would result in different inundation patterns. With increasing rainstorm peak position coefficients, urban inundation events become more severe and inundation peaks appear sooner. However, the times at which inundation occurs do not change. To determine the reasons for the differences in inundation among different rainstorm patterns, correlations between the inundation volume and the fully-filled pipes ratio were analyzed. Correlation analysis showed that inundation events are significantly related to the working state of the sewer system, indicating that a higher fully-filled pipes ratio prior to the rainstorm peak will result in more severe inundation. This conclusion suggests that the range of rainstorm peak position coefficients in China is quite reasonable. This result can provide insights to engineers and the government for urban design planning and maintenance.

AB Water stage variations are complicated in tidal rivers due to the combination of upstream flood and downstream tide. This study proposed a bidirectional stage routing model (BSR) for tidal rivers by considering the stage hydrograph as the overlay of bidirectional propagation of upstream flood wave and downstream tidal wave. The basic stage routing equations derived from the storage equation and water balance equation are used to calculate the upstream flood wave routing and the downstream tidal wave propagation, respectively. The lateral inflow can be directly specified as an additive term in the basic equation of BSR model or indirectly estimated by a lateral flow rate reflecting the proportion of lateral inflow to the upstream water. Parts of the model parameters are time-variable to account for the effect of water surface slope on water stage. The model inputs include stage hydrographs at the upstream and downstream boundaries. The channel geometric characteristics data are not required when the average channel width is estimated as a parameter. The case study results in the tidal reaches of the Caoe River and Qiantang River in China demonstrate that the BSR model performs well in water stage simulation. With relatively simple structure, modest data requirement and stable performance, the physically-based BSR model has the potential for water stage routing in tidal rivers when channel geometry data are not available.

AB Urban pluvial flooding is a global challenge that is frequently caused by the lack of available infiltration, retention and drainage capacity in cities. This paper presents RUFIDAM, an urban pluvial flood model, developed using GIS technology with the intention of rapidly estimating flood extent, depth and its associated damage. RUFIDAM integrates a 1D hydraulic drainage network model (SWMM or MOUSE) with an adapted version of rapid flood inundation models. One-metre resolution topographic data was used to identify depressions in an urban catchment. Volume-elevation relationships and minimum elevation between adjacent depressions were determined. Mass balance considerations were then used to simulate movement of water between depressions. Surcharge volumes from the 1D drainage network model were fed statically into the rapid inundation model. The model was tested on three urban catchments located in southeast Melbourne. Results of flood depth, extent and damage costs were compared to those produced using MIKE FLOOD; a well-known 1D-2D hydrodynamic model. Results showed that RUFIDAM can predict flood extent and accumulated damage cost with acceptable accuracy. Although some variations in the simulated location of flooding were observed, simulation time was reduced by two orders of magnitude compared to MIKE FLOOD. As such, RUFIDAM is suitable for large-scale flood studies and risk-based approaches that rely on a large number of simulations.

AB Water-use efficiency and uncertainty treatment are foci in the modeling of agricultural water management systems. To address these challenging issues, a robust fractional programming (RFP) method that coupled fractional programming with robust optimization was developed in this study to improve agricultural water-use efficiency under uncertainty. RFP improved upon the fractional programming by being able to tackle highly uncertain information without known distributions. It also extended the capability of the robust optimization method in addressing ratio optimal problems. To demonstrate its effectiveness and applicability, RFP was applied to a long-term agricultural water resources management problem in arid north-west China, where water scarcity and low water-use efficiency hindered local development. It generated benefit- and risk-explicit plans for crop pattern adjustments. Vegetables were recommended as the preferred crop. A number of scenarios combining different fluctuation and protection levels were analyzed and interpreted with practical implications. It was observed that higher water-use efficiency could be achieved through reducing parametric uncertainty and risk-aversion levels. Simulation experiments validated that the benefits claimed by the RFP model were sufficiently conservative and could be reliably achieved. The comparisons of RFP results against the baseline operations and those from two other alternatives demonstrated that, RFP could result in higher resource-use efficiency and controllable system-violation risks. The developed approach is also applicable to other optimization problems aiming at enhancing resource-use efficiency under uncertainty.

AB On the Tibetan Plateau, climate change, particularly increases in air temperature, significantly affects cryospheric and hydrological processes. Based on 5 typical future climate scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) under emission scenario RCP4.5 and a distributed ecohydrological model (GBEHM), this study analyzes the potential characteristics of future climate change (from 2011 to 2060) and the associated effects on the cryospheric and hydrological processes in the upper Heihe River Basin, a typical cold mountain region located on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. The precipitation, air temperature, and frozen ground elasticities of runoff/evapotranspiration are then estimated based on the simulation results. The typical future climate scenarios suggest that air temperature will increase at an average rate of 0.34 degrees C/10a in the future and that precipitation will increase slightly by 6 mm/10a under the RCP 4.5 emission scenario. Based on the GBEHM-simulated results, due to the increase in air temperature, glaciers would be reduced to less than 100 million m(3) by 2060, the permafrost area would shrink by 23%, the maximum frozen depth of seasonally frozen ground would decrease by 5.4 cm/10a and the active layer depth of the frozen ground would increase by 6.1 cm/ 10a. Additionally, runoff would decrease by approximately 5 mm/10a, and evapotranspiration would increase by approximately 9 mm/10a. The estimated elasticities indicate that annual runoff would decrease at an average rate of 24 mm/degrees C and evapotranspiration would increase at an average rate of 21 mm/degrees C with rising air temperature in the future. The impacts of increased air temperature on hydrological processes are mainly due to changes in frozen ground. The thickening of the active layer of the frozen ground increases the soil storage capacity, leading to decreased runoff and increased evapotranspiration. When the active layer depth increases by 1 cm, annual runoff decreases by approximately 1.3 mm, and annual evapotranspiration increases by approximately 0.9 mm. In addition, the shift from permafrost to seasonal frozen ground increases groundwater infiltration, which decreases surface runoff. Compared to that over the past 50 years, the effect of increased air temperature on the frozen ground in the upper Heihe River Basin will be greater in the future, which would result in a faster reduction in runoff in the future considering the effects of global warming.

AB Understanding the space-time structure and characteristics of drought is crucial for drought risk mitigation and forecasting efforts. In this paper, the drought events are identified by an improved 3-dimensional clustering algorithm. The 3-month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI3) is calculated based on the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) dataset from January 1966 to December 2015 to construct the longitude-latitudetime space. The characteristics of these identified events are described by a series of indicators such as duration, severity, intensity, affected area, centroids and track path after which the spatial pattern and temporal evolution are studied. In addition, the Vegetation Health Index (VHI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Temperature Condition Index (TCI) are also included to investigate the possible impact of drought on the vegetation health. Results show that a total of 60 persisting drought events for at least 3 months have been identified in Central Asia. The most severe drought event occurred between May 1974 and January 1976 with a duration of 21 months and an affected area of 5.77 million km(2). Most events have a duration between 3 and 5 months. In addition, the droughts in Central Asia tend to have an east-west trajectory. Seasonally, the study area experienced more drought months in spring and summer. During the recent 35 years, there has been a slowly increasing thermal stress and a significantly decreasing soil moisture stress that causes an overall decreasing drought stress on vegetation health.

AB A multivariate stochastic soil moisture (SM) estimation approach based on a Gaussian-mixture nonstationary hidden Markov model (GM-NHMM) is introduced in this study to spatially disaggregate the AMSR2 SM data for multiple locations in the Yongdam dam watershed in South Korea. Rainfall and air temperature are considered as additional predictors in the proposed modeling framework. In GM-NHMM, a six-state model is constructed with three predictors representing an unobserved state associated with SM. It is clearly seen that the rainfall predictor plays a substantial role in achieving the overall predictability. Using weather variables (i.e., rainfall and temperature) can be effective in picking up some of the predictability of local SM that is not captured by the AMSR2 data. On the other hand, larger scale dynamic features identified from the AMSR2 data seem to facilitate the identification of regional spatial patterns of SM. The efficiency of the proposed model is compared with that of an ordinary regression model (OLR) using the same predictors. The mean correlation coefficient of the proposed model is about 0.78, which is significantly greater than that of the OLR at about 0.49. The proposed GM-NHMM method not only provides a better representation of the observed SM than the OLR model but also preserves the spatial coherence across all stations reasonably well.

AB The investigation on the stress relief of magnetic materials is important both for the industrial process and the academic research. In this work, the stress effects on the magnetic characteristics in Fe-based metallic glasses (MGs) are investigated under the applied bending stress and various annealing treatments. It was found that both the magnetic induction intensity B and effective permeability mu' decrease while coercivity H-c increases with the applied compressive stress, indicating that the compressive effect is dominant on the magnetic characteristics in Fe78Si9B13 MG ribbons. We also found that the wide domain wall movement and the rotation of the narrow domains are seriously affected by internal stress during the magnetization process. Our results reveal that the stress relief plays a critical role in improving magnetic properties of Fe-based MGs and are helpful for understanding the correlations between the stress, microstructure change and magnetic softness in magnetic MGs.

AB Geopolymers are new binders resulting from the activation of an aluminosilicate source by an alkaline solution. It is well-established that the precursors that are used affect geopolymer formation. This study focuses on how to control the geopolymer setting time with an alkaline silicate solution. To conduct this investigation, various geopolymer mixtures based on different alkaline silicate solutions were characterized in terms of viscosity and setting time. To understand the link between geopolymer formation and the properties of the solution, the ionic conductivity and the viscosity of the solutions were measured. The solutions were also characterized by Raman spectroscopy. The characterization of the geopolymer mixture shows that the properties of the alkaline silicate solution highly depend on the viscosity and setting time of the geopolymer. Therefore, the alkali molar concentration (3 < [M] < 10 mol.L-1) influenced the properties of the solution (silicate species, ionic conductivity, and viscosity). A relationship among the chemical composition, the silicate species of the solution and the geopolymer setting time is highlighted depending on the n(si)/n(AI) + n (M) ratio. For example, a ratio of n(si)/n (AI) + n (M) > 1.1 permits a slower geopolymerization reaction, and the setting time of the geopolymer mixture is higher.

AB Cu nanopartides (NPs) have attracted considerable attention as a substitute for noble metals, such as Au and Pt, due to their unique surface plasmon resonance (SPR) properties, natural abundance, and low fabrication cost. We succeeded in one-step preparation of Cu NPs with a uniform size on glass surface by heating Cu2+ ions containing Na2O-Al2O3-SiO2 glass in hydrogen atmosphere. The formation of Cu NPs was confirmed using scanning and transmission electron microscopies, small-angle X-ray scattering, and visible and infrared absorption spectroscopies. Heat treatment in a hydrogen environment facilitated the diffusion of hydrogen molecules into the glass to form Cu atoms and Al OH bonds. The Cu atoms migrated through gaps formed by Al OH toward the surface, where they combined to form Cu NPs. The optical spectra of showed sharp and intense SPR bands at a peak wavelength of 580 nm, indicating the homogeneous distribution of uniformly sized Cu NPs on the glass surface without aggregation. The obtained samples exhibited good sensing performance due to the strong SPR properties. Further advantage of our method was that Cu nanoparticles can be repeatedly formed by heating under H-2 gas after removing the previously formed particles.

AB Protein assemblies are often symmetric, as this organization has many advantages compared to individual proteins. Complex protein structures thus very often possess high-order symmetries. Detection and analysis of these symmetries has been a challenging problem and no efficient algorithms have been developed so far. This paper presents the extension of our cyclic symmetry detection method for higher-order symmetries with multiple symmetry axes. These include dihedral and cubic, i.e., tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral, groups. Our method assesses the quality of a particular symmetry group and also determines all of its symmetry axes with a machine precision. The method comprises discrete and continuous optimization steps and is applicable to assemblies with multiple chains in the asymmetric subunits or to those with pseudo-symmetry.
   We implemented the method in C+ + and exhaustively tested it on all 51,358 symmetric assemblies from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). It allowed us to study structural organization of symmetric assemblies solved by X-ray crystallography, and also to assess the symmetry annotation in the PDB. For example, in 1.6% of the cases we detected a higher symmetry group compared to the PDB annotation, and we also detected several cases with incorrect annotation. The method is available at http://team.inria.fr/nano-d/software/ananas. The graphical user interface of the method built for the SAMSON platform is available at http://samson-connect.net.

AB To construct calcium carbonate skeletons of sophisticated architecture, scleractinian corals secrete an extra cellular skeletal organic matrix (SOM) from aboral ectodermal cells. The SOM, which is composed of proteins, saccharides, and lipids, performs functions critical for skeleton formation. Even though polysaccharides constitute the major component of the SOM, its contribution to coral skeleton formation is poorly understood. To this end, we analyzed the SOM of the massive colonial coral, Porites australiensis, the skeleton of which has drawn great research interest because it records environmental conditions throughout the life of the colony. The coral skeleton was extensively cleaned, decalcified with acetic acid, and organic fractions were separated based on solubility. These fractions were analyzed using various techniques, including SDS-PAGE, FT-IR, in vitro crystallization, CHNS analysis, chromatography analysis of monosaccharide and enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). We confirmed the acidic nature of SOM and the presence of sulphate, which is thought to initiate CaCO3 crystallization. In order to analyze glycan structures, we performed ELLA on the soluble SOM for the first time and found that it exhibits strong specificity to Datura stramonium lectin (DSL). Furthermore, using biotinylated DSL with anti-biotin antibody conjugated to nanogold, in situ localization of DSL-binding polysaccharides in the P. australiensis skeleton was performed. Signals were distributed on the surfaces of fiber-like crystals of the skeleton, suggesting that polysaccharides may modulate crystal shape. Our study emphasizes the importance of sugar moieties in biomineralization of scleractinian corals.

AB Electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) of purified macromolecular complexes is now providing 3D-structures at near-atomic resolution (Kuhlbrandt, 2014). Cryo-EM can tolerate heterogeneous specimens, however, high-resolution efforts demand highly optimized samples. Therefore, significant pre-screening and evaluation is essential before a final dataset can be obtained.
   While cryo-EM is comparably slow and requires access to expensive high-end electron microscopes, room temperature negative stain EM is fast, inexpensive and provides immediate feedback. This has made it a popular approach for sample quality control in the early phases of a project. Optimization in negative stain can be critical not only for cryo-EM, but also for X-ray crystallography, as highlighted for example by studies on GPCR complexes (Kang et al., 2015; Rasmussen et al., 2012). However, when not done carefully and interpreted correctly, negative stain can be prone to artifacts. A typical problem, which is often overlooked in the interpretation of EM data of small membrane proteins, is the background, caused by empty detergent micelles, as it can be easily confused with detergent embedded protein samples.
   To counteract this ubiquitous problem, we present a case study on commonly used detergents. We show that most detergents produce significant background in negative stain EM, even below nominal critical micelle concentration (CMC). Unawareness of such artefacts can lead to misinterpretation of sample quality and homogeneity. We hope that this study can serve as a template to evaluate images in the early phases of a project.

AB Gly missense mutations in type I collagen, which replace a conserved Gly in the repeating (Gly-Xaa-Yaa)(n) sequence with a larger residue, are known to cause Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). The clinical consequences of such mutations range from mild to lethal, with more serious clinical severity associated with larger Gly replacement residues. Here, we investigate the influence of the identity of the residue replacing Gly within and adjacent to the integrin binding (502)GFPGER(507) sequence on triple-helix structure, stability and integrin binding using a recombinant bacterial collagen system. Recombinant collagens were constructed with Gly substituted by Ala, Ser or Val at four positions within the integrin binding region. All constructs formed a stable triple-helix structure with a small decrease in melting temperature. Trypsin was used to probe local disruption of the triple helix, and Gly to Val replacements made the triple helix trypsin sensitive at three of the four sites. Any mutation at Gly505, eliminated integrin binding, while decreased integrin binding affinity was observed in the replacement of Gly residues at Gly502 following the order Val > Ser > Ala. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that all Gly replacements led to transient disruption of triple-helix interchain hydrogen bonds in the region of the Gly replacement These computational and experimental results lend insight into the complex molecular basis of the varying clinical severity of OI.

AB Amyloid fibrils are polymers formed by proteins under specific conditions and in many cases they are related to pathogenesis, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Their hallmark is the presence of a beta-sheet structure. High resolution structural data on these systems as well as information gathered from multiple complementary analytical techniques is needed, from both a fundamental and a pharmaceutical perspective. Here, a previously reported de novo designed, pH-switchable coiled coil-based peptide that undergoes structural transitions resulting in fibril formation under physiological conditions has been exhaustively characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), cryo-TEM, atomic force microscopy (AFM), wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and solid-state NMR (ssNMR). Overall, a unique 2-dimensional carpet-like assembly composed of large coexisiting ribbon-like, tubular and funnel-like structures with a clearly resolved protofilament substructure is observed. Whereas electron microscopy and scattering data point somewhat more to a hairpin model of beta-fibrils, ssNMR data obtained from samples with selectively labelled peptides are in agreement with both, hairpin structures and linear arrangements.

AB Icing on aluminum conductors might cause failure of transmission lines. Much work has been done to study the issue. In this study, superhydrophobic surface with hydrangea-like micro/nano structure on aluminum was successfully prepared by ultrasonic chemical etching in combination with boiling. The wettability of the as-prepared surface was analyzed, the contact angle of the surface was 161.37 degrees as well as the sliding angle was less than 1 degrees. The as-prepared surface could greatly prolong the time of icing and frosting even in low temperature, for the structure induced lots of micro/nano air bags. They could certainly reduce the heat transferring between the solid surface and water. Moreover, the as-prepared surface demonstrated good stability under the continuous corrosion of simulated acid rain, remained superhydrophobicity after 7-days corrosion. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A low-cost and scalable ultrasonic synthetic method to produce copper metal current collector with uniform nanopores on the surface is achieved for the first time. A layer of silicon active material was sputtered on the surface of as-prepared metal current collector (vs. metal lithium) as an innovative current collecting material for lithium ion battery. The assembled battery with this current collector showed an areal capacity of 2.2 mAh/cm(2), comparable to that of commercially available lithium ion batteries. Due to the nano-porous structure of current collector, the silicon active material electrochemical capacity retention and cycling stability also improved significantly. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Y2O3:Bi3+ thin films of various microstructures were deposited using different deposition times by means of a radio frequency magnetron sputtering system. The deposition time affects the surface morphology, crystalline phase and the optical properties of the Y2O3:Bi3+ thin films. The films with the shorter and longer deposition time were amorphous and cubic in structure, respectively. The Bi3+ ions in the cubic structure emitted in the broad blue band centered at 410 nm, while the amorphous structure also emitted in the green region. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, polyvinyl alcohol sponge filled with polystyrene nanoparticles was used as template to guide the polymerization of pyrrole monomer with PdCl2 as oxidant. After calcination, Pd@nitrogendoped carbon nanocapsules (NCCs) were synthesized on the networked carbon microfibers (NCFs). Pd@NCC/NCF has combined the advantages of one-dimensional carbon microfibers and zero-dimensional nanocapsules together, which not only provided numerous channels for mass diffusion, but also possessed high surface area. In catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol, it displayed better catalytic activity than corresponding counterparts prepared without filling polystyrene nanoparticles. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB This work reports the structural, morphological and luminescent properties of GdPO4-Gd-3 PO7:Yb3+, Ln(3+) (Ln = Er, Ho, Tm) phosphors which have been synthesized by Pechini sol-gel process. The XRD patterns indicated that all the samples are crystalline and have a mixture of monoclinic monazite and monoclinic phases. Some samples were synthesized with ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) and had better crystallinity than these synthesized without NH4OH. The up-conversion emissions were obtained under excitation at 967 nm. According to our results, the color emission was tuned from red to green by increasing the Yb3+ concentration from 5 mol% to 20 mol%. Moreover, the use of NH4OH to synthesize the samples doped with 20 mol% of Yb3+ enhanced their green emission band approximate to 3 times. The results reveal that doping the GdPO4-Gd3PO7 particles with rare earths produce an up-conversion emission which can be useful for the fabrication of luminescent coatings or lighting devices.

AB Cu-Al-Ni and Cu-Al-Ni-Mn shape memory alloys are deposited on Kapton polyimide sheets by a physical evaporation technique. Detailed investigations on the morphological, structural and thermal behaviour of the ternary and quaternary alloys are conducted. The developed samples exhibit an increase in martensite structures and decrease in transformation temperatures after Mn additions. Furthermore, the suppression of Cu 3 Al precipitates was evident from XRD analysis. The thermomechanical behaviour was analysed by actuating the bimorphs through Joule heating under varying mechanical loads. Fatigue analysis of the bimorphs reveals a superior performance for Cu-Al-Ni-Mn, exhibiting less than 30% loss in displacement after 15,000 cycles. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we illustrated the principles of synthesis, the structure, and the functions of a novel konjac glucomannan (KGM) based biopolymer-silica hybrid materials. Nano-silicon dioxide (SiO2) was applied as composites, combined with KGM, to form a highly porous structure by using a simple and versatile route - freeze drying. We systematically varied the Nano-SiO2 concentration and solution pH value, the as-prepared organic-inorganic porous materials are highly ordered and highly strengthened with an average porous diameter of 100 mu m, with honeycomb structure, tailored mechanical properties, and excellent support capacity. Activated carbon (AC)-loaded porous materials (CKNSi) exhibited a high Cu(II) adsorption capacity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB ZnGa2O4:Yb3+,Er3+,Cr3+ UCPL powder phosphors were prepared via high temperature solid-state reaction by incorporating a UC pair Yb3+/Er3+ into the PL phosphor ZnGa2O4:Cr3+. Both the PL and UCPL were all achieved in as-prepared ZGO:Yb,Er, Cr powders owing to the energy transfer between Er3+ ions and Cr3+ ions, which is attributed to the spectral overlap between the UC emission band of Er3+ ions and the excitation band of Cr3+ ions. Besides, under the excitation at 980 nm, the ZGO:Yb,Er, Cr powder phosphors can generate strong UC emissions from Er3+ ions at 524 nm, 549 nm, 659 nm and Cr3+ ions around 700 nm. Moreover, the morphological and structural characterization were studied, illustrating all ZGO:Yb,Er, Cr powders are high degree of crystallinity and contain regular long rods with diameter of 600-900 nm. In addition, the influence of the doping content of Yb3+, Er3+, Cr3+ ions and the UCPL mechanism were also discussed in this paper.

AB A reduction method was proposed to synthesize better dispersed molybdenum oxide quantum dots (MoOx QDs) with stable fluorescence properties by using molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as precursor and oxidant, and using ethanol as reducing agent and surfactant of oleylamine as modified agent. The morphology of the as-prepared MoOx QDs with average size of 1.96 nm were observed, calculated and analyzed from TEM and AFM detections. Excitation-dependent photoluminescence emission of MoOx QDs could be obtained and MoOx QDs exhibited blue fluorescence under UV light irradiation. Factors that influenced the syntheses of MoOx QDs were discussed, and the highest value of fluorescence intensity was exhibited with the adding of 5 mL oleylamine and the reaction time of 24 h. The cell imaging behaviors, the physiological stabilities and in vitro cytotoxicity testing of MoOx QDs were further discussed with HeLa cells as model. And the results showed that it might be a promising biomedical material as high quality fluorescent probes for bio-imaging.

AB Up-conversion is one of the promising approaches for energy and biomedical applications. To enable significant power conversion efficiencies, high irradiance is required. In solar energy applications, this irradiance translates to solar concentrations higher than one sun, unable to be obtained without geometrical or local-field concentration. For biomedical applications, enhanced sensitivity and imaging resolution are required, accompanied by low sample volumes. In this review, the performance of approaches with geometrical concentration on up conversion processes is reviewed based on recently reported results.

AB LaAlO3 samples doped with thulium ions were prepared by the sol-gel method. The samples were annealed at 800 and 1100 degrees C. The sizes of the nanocrystals were 28 and 70 nm for the 800 and 1100 degrees C sample, respectively. Nanocrystals with 0.5 wt %, 3 wt%, 5 wt%, 7 wt% of Tm3+ were investigated by the spectroscopic means, for comparison data obtained for LaAlO3: Tm3+ single crystal was shown. Absorption, emission, and emission decay times were measured at room temperature in the IR, visible and near UV range. The difference in absorption and emission spectra and luminescence decay time determined by the methods of preparation and size of the samples are investigated.

AB The terahertz (THz) absorption properties of a gated graphene monolayer placed on top of a one-dimensional photonic crystal is investigated in the presence of a perpendicular magnetostatic bias. The response of electrons to the magnetic field is inspected in the quantum regime, due to the low doping level of graphene grown on the C-terminated surface of silicon-carbide. It has been shown that there is the possibility of achieving enhanced absorption at low magnetic fields for certain states of circular polarization of light. Furthermore, adjusting the gate voltage of the graphene provides another method of tuning absorption in the proposed structure. Therefore, one can obtain enhanced absorption with the appropriate choices of magnetic and electric biases. We believe that these properties make our structure suitable for designing tunable graphene-based THz absorbers.

AB High quantum efficiencies CaLaMgM1-xO6:xMn(4+) (M = Nb, Ta; 0 < x <= 0.006) phosphors are prepared by a solid-state reaction method, and their crystal structure and luminescence property are investigated. The excitation spectra of CaLaMgM1-xO6:xMn(4+) revealed two excitation bands at 250-450 nm and 450-600 nm corresponding to (4)A(2) -> T-4(1) and (4)A(2) -> T-4(2) transition of Mn4+ ions respectively, and emission spectra cover from 650 to 800 nm with the strongest emission peak at 710 nm owing to the E-4 -> (4)A(2) transition of Mn4+ ions. The optimal Mn4+ doping concentrations for both of CaLaMgNbO6 and CaLaMgTaO6 host are determined to be 0.004 mol. The PL intensity and quantum efficiencies of the entitled phosphors excited under related UV light are investigated and compared with that of K2TiF6:Mn4+, Y2O3:Eu3+, CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ phosphors. Finally, a bright red LED was fabricated by using a 365 nm UV chip with the as-prepared CaLaMgNbO6:Mn4+ phosphor.

AB Nowadays highly efficient red phosphors with blue or near-UV excitation are strongly required to improve performance of existing white LEDs. With this aim in view, the Eu3+-doped YSiO2N ceramics with the pseudowollastonite structure was fabricated and thoroughly studied spectroscopically. The presence of two anions - O2- and N3- - around Eu3+ ions causes a shift of the host valence band (VB) to lower energy and a certain asymmetry of the impurity sites. After illumination by near-UV excitation light (280-360 nm), the YSiO2N:Eu3+ sample exhibited strong red luminescence at around 620 nm assigned to the hypersensitive D-5(0)-> F-7(2) transition of the Eu3+ ions. Compared with three Eu3+-doped oxides (alpha-CaSiO3:Eu3+ which has the same pseudo-wollastonite structure, and alpha- and y-Y2Si2O7:Eu3+ which have the same cation composition), the charge transfer (CT) band was red-shifted by more than 9.5 x 10(3) cm(-1) because the VB top increases. From the Judd-Ofelt analysis, it was found out that the YSiO2N:Eu3+ sample has the large Judd-Ofelt intensity parameter, Omega(2), which is correlated with the dopant's site asymmetry. As expected, the mixed-anion coordination which consists of oxide and nitride anions resulted in the strong hypersensitive transition at 620 nm, which is characteristic Eu3+ red luminescence at the lower symmetry site. In addition, the fluorescence lifetime of the Eu3+ luminescence at 0 K (tau(0)) was estimated experimentally to be 0.664 ms, which was shorter than the radiative lifetime (tau(R)), 1.32 ms, based on the Judd-Ofelt analysis. The experimental quantum yield measured with an integrating sphere, 32.3%, was lower than the internal quantum efficiency, 50.3%, evaluated from the ratio of tau(0)/tau(R). The proposed material can be suitable for applications as a red phosphor.

TI Titanium resonators based ultra-broadband perfect light absorber

DT Article
DE Perfect absorber; Resonators; Plasmonic
ID DUAL-BAND; NITRIDE; PLASMON; ABSORPTION
AB We propose a new approach for achieving ultra-broadband perfect absorber by using titanium (Ti) resonators. Near-unity absorption with a high average absorptivity of 91.4% is achieved through the whole spectral range from 0.4 mu m to 2 mu m for the double-period lattice of Ti resonators array on the top of a silica layer coated on the opaque Ti substrate. In contrast to the common metal-insulator-metal (MIM) absorbers only with tens of nanometers absorption bandwidth, the Ti based ultra-broadband perfect absorber (T-UPA) can show a perfect absorption window (i.e., the absorptivity exceeding 90%) with the spectral bandwidth over 1007 nm from visible to near-infrared region (i.e., from 0.485 mu m to 1.492 mu m). The cooperative effects of the propagating surface plasmons and the corresponding localized plasmonic resonances of Ti resonators contribute to the broadband absorption response. Moreover, the ultra-broadband perfect absorption is polarization-independent and angle insensitive, which hold the proposed T-UPA with strong practicality and high tolerance in the complex electromagnetic environment (ie. sun radiation). Furthermore, the absorption window for this T-UPA can be greatly broadened via using a thin anti-reflection coating film, which shows a perfect absorption with the bandwidth of 1555 nm in the visible and near-infrared range. The numerically demonstrated thin-film absorber configuration facilitates the scalability to optoelectronics applications such as thermal photovoltaics and hot-electron devices.

AB We tested four YAG:Ce phosphor powders to use for illumination and communication. The illumination and communication function could be put together and create a multifunctional light source. The Visible Light Communication (VLC) technology is based on this principle. The VLC will be engaged in 5G networks. The tested phosphor powders were mixed with Poly-Di-Methyl-Siloxane (PDMS) and hardened in a parabolic reflector. A blue laser diode was used for excitation of the phosphor powders. The measured illumination characteristics were colour coordinates x and y and Correlated Colour Temperature (CCT). The measured communication characteristics were rise time, fall time and photoluminescence decay time. The experimental results showed that one of the four phosphor powders can be used for illumination and communication purposes.

AB Highly fluorescence, 3-(p-nitrophenyl)-7-diethylamino and 3-cyano-7-diethylaminocoumarin, iminocoumarins derivatives differing by the position of substituents and acceptors groups were investigated and characterized using H-1, C-13 NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy analysis. These dyes were photophysically characterized and the effects of the substituents investigated. As a result, efficient charge transfer was maintained through the molecule. UV visible absorption and fluorescence spectra of these dyes became shifted to longer wavelengths upon substitution at 7-position and depend on the attractor group. However, tradeoffs in spectral shifts were observed when two donor attractor electron groups such as N-diethyl substitue at position 7 and nitrophenyl in position 3, respectively. Theoretical calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT) for studying the molecular structure and optical properties of the investigated molecule.

AB TeO1.4/SiO2 one-dimensional photonic crystals (1D PCs) were prepared using radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering to fabricate a reflector and a filter with photonic band gaps (PBGs) in the near infrared (NIR) region. Stoichiometry and phase state of the TeOx thin film were characterized via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), respectively. The microstructural and optical characteristics of the 1D PCs were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and ultraviolet visible near-infrared spectrophotometer (UV-VIS-NIR). The experimental reflectance spectra were consistent with the theoretical results simulated using the transfer matrix method (TMM). For the reflector, a PBG of 1273-1676 nm (Delta lambda = 403 mu) was achieved in the NIR region. For the filter, the introduction of a defect layer in the 1D PC led to a resonant peak at the central wavelength of 1461 tun within the PBG of 1250-1733 nm (Delta lambda = 483 nm). The effects of the structural parameters, including the incident angle, the state of polarization and the thickness of the defect layer, were also theoretically analyzed.

AB We demonstrated highly efficient laser emission of a 6% at Yb:(Lu,Y)(2)O-3 ceramic sample with formula (Th0.06Lu0.12Y0.78Zr0.04)(2)O-3 (Le. Yb doped solid solution of Y2O3 and Lu2O3 with Zirconia as sintering aid) fabricated by means of solid-state sintering of mixed sesquioxide nanoparticles under vacuum. The ceramics features a very good optical quality, with a transmission very close to the theoretical limit. The spectroscopic characteristics were investigated, resulting in intermediate properties between Yb:Y2O3 and Yb:Lu2O3. Laser emission was obtained under diode pumping at 936 nm, in CW and quasi-CW pumping condition. We measured a maximum output power of 3.9 W at 1077 nm while the highest slope efficiency was 51.2%, in quasi-CW regime. In CW, at the same laser wavelength, the output power was 2.2 W with a corresponding slope efficiency of 35.1%. The explored range of tunability, 97 nm, is to the best of our knowledge one of the broadest and continuous intervals measured with Yb-doped materials. Mixed Lu-Y ceramic sesquioxides appear then as a promising laser material for broadly tunable laser sources and, in consequence, for the generation of ultrashort laser pulses.

AB The displacements on the whispering gallery modes (WGM) wavelengths of the three emission bands (660 nm, 760 nm and 1200 nm) of Ho3+ doped yttrium aluminosilicate microspheres were analysed as a function of the temperature. The displacements have been studied in order to evaluate the viability of these microspheres as thermal sensors. A 532 nm continuous wave laser was used to excite and heat the microspheres using a confocal microscope setup. Average displacement rates of the WGM peaks with the laser power of 5.3, 6.2 and 9.7 p.m./mW were found for the emission bands centred at 660 rim, 760 nm and 1200 nm, respectively. Temperature uncertainties of 0.6 K for the band centred at 660 nm, 0.5 K for the 760 nm band and 0.3 K for the 1200 nm band have been obtained. It is interesting to note that the maximum resolution corresponds to the band centred at 1200 nm that is especially interesting because it is inside the second biological window, which has medical applications.

AB Optical waveguides are main components for the development of integrated photonic devices, not only for allowing light guidance but also for their ability to act as nonlinear optical elements. Direct laser writing with ultrashort pulses has provided considerable advances in the fabrication of 3D waveguides and the improvement of its optical properties. Nonetheless, such progresses have been achieved for waveguides designed in inorganic materials and little attention has been devoted to organic crystals, which offer new perspectives for the field. In this direction, this paper describes the fs-laser inscription of cladding waveguides in an amino acid crystal, with guiding losses on the order of 0.5 dB/mm at visible and infrared regions. Such waveguides are able to act as active nonlinear optical elements, supporting broadband second harmonic generation centered at 377 nm, with a normalized power conversion efficiency of (10.3 +/- 0.4) % (MW cm(2))(-1). Its normalized intensity conversion efficiency was greater than the one for the crystal itself, probably due to the influence of the waveguide dispersion contribution on the phase matching condition.

AB Several complex strontium borate matrices (Sr-3(B2O6), Sr-2(B2O5), SrB2O4, SrB4O7, SrB6O10 and SrB8O11) doped with Sm2+/3+ ions were prepared using a modified Pechini method, with increasing Sr2+/boric acid ratio and a two-step annealing process. The Sm3+ ions were transformed into Sm2+ ones without additional reducing agents during the syntheses performed in the air atmosphere. The obtained crystal structures were investigated using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) method. The use of 300% molar excess of boric acid during the synthesis process (Sr:B ratio 1:3), resulted in the formation of pure SrB2O4: Sm2+ nanoparticles, whose morphology was investigated with the use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Luminescence properties of the Sm2+ and Sm3+ doped compounds, i.e. excitation and emission spectra, including luminescence decay curves and determined lifetimes, were investigated. The obtained doped strontium borates show strong emission from Sm2+ and Sm3+ ions, in the range from 550 to 780 nm, after UV-Vis excitation. Depending on the lambda(ex) used four characteristic bands of the Sm3+ ions, i.e. (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(5/2), (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(7/2), (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(9/2), (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(11/2), and a series of split, very narrow bands typical of the Sm2+ ions, i.e. D-5(0)-> F-7(0), D-5(0)-> F-7(1), D-5(0)-> F-7(2), D-5(0)-> F-7(3), were clearly observed in the spectra. Chromaticity coordinates (CIE diagram) were calculated for different Sr:B ratios, showing a colour tuneable luminescence of the products synthesized.

AB This work involves the synthesis and characterization of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) layers. The films were prepared on ITO/glass substrate by ecofriendly and simple single-step electrodeposition method followed by sulfurization and annealing at 500 degrees C under Argon flow. By using two different complexing agents, the electrodeposition process can give better results. Therefore, the effect of combining the trisodium citrate - TC to multiple cornplexing agents (cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide - CTAB, ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid - EDTA, Boric Acid - BA, Glutamic Acid - GA and Tartaric Acid - TA) is investigated. The characterization of the absorber films was done by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, Raman spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Diffuse Reflectivity. The combination of TC and CTAB is suggested to be the best pair of complexing agents within the combinations used in this work.

Judd-Oflet parameters Omega(t) (t = 2, 4, 6), branching ratio, beta, fluorescence full width at half maximum (FWHM) of NIR emission, and life time tau, of I-13/2 level have been evaluated. The glasses were characterized by a higher values of FWHM of NIR emission at 1.53 mu m under excitation by wavelength 980 nm with respect to other glasses system doped by single Er3+ ions. In the future these glasses can be fabricated as broadband fiber amplifier for the optical communication devices. The glasses studied glasses exhibit green emission under excitation wavelength of 445 mn.

AB A straightforward, rapid, and environmentally-friendly technique was developed for the synthesis of nitrogen and phosphorus co-doped fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) with the use of lily bulbs (LB) as raw materials. The as synthesized LB-CDs showed high stability in aqueous solution and high fluorescence with a quantum yield (QY) of 17.6%. The LB-CDs were then used as a fluorescence sensor for Cu2+ ion detection based on the Cu2+-ionstimulated fluorescence quenching of LB-CDs. The synthesized LB-CDs demonstrated exceptional selectivity and sensitivity to Cu2+ ions, with a limit of detection of 12.8 nM and a linear detection range of 0.05-2.0 mu M. The synthesized LB-CDs were also applied for the detection of Cu2+ ions in real water samples. Moreover, the LB-CDs exhibited low cytotoxicity, which is suitable for fluorescence-based analysis and cell imaging.

AB Photoluminescence and thermally stimulated luminescence of Gd-3(Ga,Al)(5)O-12:Ce single crystals and epitaxial films co-doped with different concentrations of Mg2+ ions are investigated in the 77-500 K temperature range under excitation in the 4f - 5d(1) and 4f - 5d(2) absorption bands of Ce3+ ions. Influence of Mg2+ ions on the photoluminescence intensity, spectrum, decay kinetics, temperature dependence of the photoluminescence intensity, and the activation energy of luminescence thermal quenching is observed. Co-doping with Mg2+ is shown to result in a drastic reduction of the afterglow and thermally stimulated luminescence and in a strong shortening of the afterglow decay kinetics. It influences also defects creation spectra and the activation energy of the photostimulated defects creation. The Mg2+ - induced changes in the characteristics of the Gd-3(Ga,Al)(5)O-12:Ce, Mg single crystals and epitaxial films are found to be strongly different, and possible reasons of these differences are discussed.

AB The tangible harvesting of the extensive near-infrared (NIR) range of solar radiation is an ambitious goal to enhance the efficiency for various energy and environmental applications where usually large parts of the solar spectrum are not efficiently utilized, there is plenty of energy at the bottom. In various areas of solar power engineering, in particular in photocatalysis, photon up-conversion (UC) has been attracting growing interest to bridge large band gaps of efficient photocatalysts by shifting NIR photons into UV-VIS ones. Here we highlight recent studies in the field of UC for the photonic activation of photocatalysts. We also present high intense UC UV-blue emissions from K2YbF5:Tm3+ hydrothermal crystals under 980 nm laser excitation for degradation of organic-dyes, proving the role of the UC effect as a clear evidence of spectral shaping of light for photocatalytic environmental purification.

AB Sub-micro powder of Europium doped lead fluoride solid solution (Pb1-xEuxF2+x) is synthesized by co-precipitation method. The structural, thermal and optical properties have been studied. The DRX results for the as grown samples show that an increase in Eu3 + concentration changes the PbF2 structure from a mixed phase to a cubic phase and a decrease of grain size. The DTA curve indicates that the alpha-PbF2 to beta-PbF2 phase transition temperature is 357 degrees C. The sample structure is transformed from a pure alpha phase or mixed phases to a pure beta phase after annealing at 400 degrees C. The optical energy band gaps for Pb1-xEuxF2+x, solid solutions have been determined. Excitation and emission properties have been discussed in details. The shorter wavelength emission lines are quenched by increasing the Eu3+ concentrations. This quenching effect is due to a cross-relaxation occurring between two neighboring Eu3+ ions. On another hand, the longer wavelength emission lines increase gradually up to 10% Eu3+ concentration and decrease at higher concentrations. The critical distance is determined to be 10 angstrom and the mechanism for concentration quenching has been elaborated.

AB Europium (Eu3+)-doped oxyfluorosiliacte (SALfSfEu: SiO2 + Al2O3 + LiF + SrF2 + Eu2O3) glasses have been fabricated by usual melt-quenching technique. These glasses were characterized through optical absorption, excitation, emission and decay curve analysis. The Judd-Ofelt (JO) parameters have been evaluated from the refractive index and luminescence spectrum of the 1.0 mol% Eu3+-doped glass. The quantitative radiative properties including branching ratio, radiative lifetime and stimulated emission cross-sections of the fluorescent levels were predicted by using the JO parameters. Luminescence intensity increases as for as 0.5 mol% and then decreases with further increasing Eu3+ ion concentration. Photoluminescence quantum yield found to be as high as 74% for 0.05 mol% of Eu3+ ion concentration and decreased by increasing concentration. Luminescence intensity ratio is found to be 3.17 for 1.0 mol% Eu3+-doped SALfSfEu1.0 glass which suggest that the occupation of high degree of symmetry by the Eu3+ ions. Fluorescent decay curves of the emitting level exhibit an exponential behaviour. Lifetime of D-5(0)-> F-7(2) transition was decreased slightly with increasing Eu3+ ion concentration, however, not significant for D-5(1)-> F-7(1) transition. Luminescence properties reveal that the red emission at 612 nm found to be suitable for developing the lasers and display devices in the visible region.

AB Research activities are increasingly global so that embeddedness in international knowledge networks is decisive for inventive and innovative performance. We analyze determinants of countries' embeddedness in the global photovoltaics knowledge network for the period 1980-2015 and argue that positions in this network are determined by the structure and functionality of national research systems and by instruments within the policy mix for renewable energies. We show that cohesion and connectedness of the national research system positively affect international embeddedness, whereas centralized systems are detrimental to embeddedness. This indicates that a diffusion oriented research system allows better access to international knowledge flows. Policy instruments, especially demand side instruments, show a positive effect on embeddedness.

In addressing the evolution of the government sponsored collaboration network, this study has identified that actors are more likely to engage in collaboration with prior partners, partners of direct & indirect partners, and partners with similar attributes. These collaboration patterns, in turn, negatively impact direct ties and network efficiency, and increase the attribute proximity of an actor's network. On the other hand, the estimation results indicate that direct ties have an inverted U-shaped effect on innovation performance, while indirect ties are found to be positively related to innovation performance. As expected, a positive effect of network efficiency is found on innovation performance. The results of attribute proximity variables suggest geographical proximity is negatively related to innovation performance. Taken together, the collaboration patterns in the government sponsored network might have a negative impact on innovation performance of network actors. The empirical findings extend the network literature that collaboration network matters differently in different research contexts, and it is no longer appropriate to simply assume that collaboration is purely a good thing. As such, special attention should be paid to the network structure and composition in further policy design.

AB The Great Recession, which began in 2008, brought about large contractions in aggregate consumption in many countries. In this research, we study the impact of heterogeneous decreases in demand on innovation investments by analyzing the evolution of innovation investments in a panel of Spanish manufacturing firms during the 2004-2013 period. We proxy heterogeneous variation in demand with net exit rates in the productive stratum of each firm, defined as the group of firms in the same industry and size class. These net exit rates are computed considering all firms in the stratum, including firms that are determined to be non-innovative firms. To support the identification strategy, we show that exit rates do not capture idiosyncratic unobservable characteristics among innovative firms. In addition, we control for the effect of time-varying credit constraints. We find that a one standard deviation increase in exit rates is associated with reductions of 1.5% in the share of firms investing in innovation. The drop is larger for smaller firms, which also experience greater decreases in sales. Since smaller firms are most sensitive to demand drops, they are the natural candidates to be the target of policies devoted to increasing R&D activities during crises. As additional analysis, we study firms' perceptions of the main obstacles to innovation to find that net exit rates capture the heterogeneous variation in demand, rather than credit constraints. Finally, when analyzing the exit patterns of firms in the sample, we confirm that the net exit rate in a firm's stratum does not drive the exit of firms in our sample.

AB Background: Patients with COPD are frequently diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. Peripheral endothelial dysfunction is an underlying mechanism and can be used as an early marker of cardiovascular impairment. To date, little is known on the association between peripheral endothelial dysfunction, cardiovascular risk factors and measurements of exercise capacity in patients with COPD. Therefore, we aimed to determine the relation between endothelial function and patient characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors and (micro)vascular and functional performance in patient with CODP.
   Methods: Clinical and demographic data of patients with COPD were measured during routine pre-rehabilitation assessment. Cardiovascular risk factors, including blood pressure, ankle brachial index, arterial stiffness and retinal vessel widths were obtained. Peripheral endothelial function was measured using the EndoPAT-2000. Functional performance was assessed using cardiopulmonary exercise test, constant work rate test and six-minute walk test.
   Results: 40 patients with COPD completed the study protocol (65% males; mean age: 62.8 +/- 7.3 years; mean FEV1: 45.8 +/- 17.5 %pred). Peripheral endothelial dysfunction was observed in 55% of the patients. Patients with peripheral endothelial dysfunction had significantly worse aerobic exercise capacity and higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. Stepwise multivariate regression models identified sex, systolic blood pressure and maximal aerobic capacity as independent correlates of peripheral endothelial function. After correction for sex, age and systolic blood pressure, there was a significant partial correlation between peripheral endothelial function and maximal aerobic capacity (R = 0.51, p = 0.004).
   Conclusion: Peripheral endothelial function was positively associated with maximal aerobic capacity, when correcting for sex, age and systolic blood pressure. Establishing peripheral endothelial dysfunction as a determinant of impaired aerobic capacity in COPD can be valuable for developing interventions aiming to improve aerobic capacity, and in turn cardiovascular health.

AB Background: The stability of the new GOLD 2017 COPD staging is unknown, as well as the frequency of individual transitions in COPD stages beyond one year.
   Methods: All COPD participants in the CHAIN cohort were re-analysed according to GOLD 2017 up to five years of follow-up. Their individual changes within COPD stages were aggregated into cohort-wide Markov chains; group stability was evaluated using joinpoint regression.
   Results: At baseline, 959 COPD patients were distributed according to GOLD 2017 stages as 37.7% in A, 38.3% B, 8.2% C, and 15.7% D. The group proportion of patients in each stage was maintained from years one to five. However, we found significant changes between stages at the individual patient level, especially in the more severe stages. The probability of a patient remaining in the same GOLD 2017 COPD stage for two consecutive years ranged during the five years of follow-up for stage C from 16% to 31% per year, while for D from 23% to 43% per year, indicating substantial variation either increasing or decreasing severity for the vast majority of patients.
   Conclusions: We conclude that group stability observed in COPD staging according to GOLD 2017 recommendations is paired with a large variability at the individual patient level.

AB Objectives: Many studies of infant sleep rely solely on parentally-reported data, assuming that parents accurately report their infant's sleep parameters. The objective of this paper is to examine whether night-time sleep parameters of exclusively breastfed or exclusively formula-fed infants differ, and whether correspondence between parental reports and objective measures varies by feeding type.
   Methods: Mother-infant dyads intending to breastfeed or formula-feed exclusively for 18 weeks were recruited. Mothers were multiparas and primiparas, aged between 18 and 45 years. Infants were fullterm, normal birthweight singletons. Maternal report and actigraphic data on infant sleep were collected fortnightly, from four to 18 weeks postpartum. Data were analysed cross-sectionally using t-tests and GLM analysis to control for interaction between feed-type and sleep location.
   Results: Actigraphy-assessed infant sleep parameters did not vary by feed-type but parentally reported sleep parameters did. Maternal report and actigraphy data diverged at 10 weeks postpartum and discrepancies were associated with infant feeding type. Compared to actigraphy, maternal reports by formula-feeding mothers (controlling for infant sleep location) over-estimated infant's Total Sleep Time (TST) at 10 weeks and Longest Sleep Period (LSP) at 10, 12 and 18 weeks.
   Conclusions: These results raise questions about the outcomes of previous infant sleep studies where accuracy of parentally-reported infant sleep data is assumed. That parental reports of infant sleep vary by feeding type is particularly important for reconsidering previous studies of infant sleep development and intervention studies designed to influence sleep outcomes, especially where feed-type was heterogeneous, but was not considered as an independent variable.

AB Objective: Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a common sleep disturbance in patients with neurodegenerative disorders. We aimed to compare sleep parameters among the different types of RBD patients.
   Methods: A total of 122 patients with dream enactment behavior were screened. Of these, 92 patients who were diagnosed with RBD by polysomnography were included in this study. Enrolled patients with RBD were classified into four groups based on the following diagnoses: idiopathic RBD (iRBD); RBD with Parkinson disease (PD-RBD); multiple system atrophy (MSA) with RBD (MSA-RBD); and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) with RBD (DLB-RBD). Various clinical and polysomnographic parameters were compared.
   Results: Among the 92 patients with RBD, 35 had iRBD, 25 had PD-RBD, 17 had MSA-RBD, and 15 had DLB-RBD. The mean apnea-hypopnea index of atypical parkinsonism with RBD (AP-RBD) group was 16.2 +/- 17.7 events/h (MSA-RBD, 14.0 +/- 16.6; DLB-RBD, 18.8 +/- 19.1), which was significantly higher than the other groups (p < 0.05). The proportion of patients with 100% supine sleep in the AP-RBD group (44%) was higher than that in the iRBD group (14%; p = 0.030). The proportion of OSA with 100% supine sleep position was significantly higher in the MSA-RBD and DLB-RBD groups than in the iRBD group (p = 0.042 and p = 0.029, respectively).
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that patients in the MSA-RBD and DLB-RBD groups had a tendency to sleeping in the supine position and a higher vulnerability to OSA compared to other RBD groups. Further cohort studies are needed to evaluate the influence of these factors on the development of parkinsonism. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A plan to achieve self-sufficiency in manufacturing biologicals for public health has been structured for the last 40 years in Brazil, in the context of a reform in the health system. Industrial plants of the national public laboratories have been modernized, and a program for reducing morbidity and mortality of venomous snakebite has been created, as part of the National Epidemiological Surveillance System. The epidemiological data are essential to plan for the antivenom production of 400,000 vials of snake antivenoms per year, and the acquisition by the Ministry of Health, which is the exclusive purchaser in the country. Distribution is decentralized to reach hospitals in almost 3000 municipalities, and to provide free of charge antivenom treatment. The National Sanitary Surveillance Agency organized the regulatory environment to implement rules and supervise compliance of GMP procedures, elevating the quality of the biologicals that are produced, as well as reducing the costs in production. Despite all the advances in the health system, antivenom availability and accessibility is not uniform in regards to the most vulnerable parts of the populations, which inhabit remote areas in the Brazilian Amazon region. Better logistics and transportation of liquid form antivenoms is an issue to be addressed and realistic and comprehensive health programs for indigenous groups should be effectively structured, in order to reduce the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with snakebite envenoming.

   ANALYSIS
AB Microcystins (MCs) pollution has quickly risen in infamy and has become a major problem to public health worldwide. MCs are a group of monocyclic hepatotoxic peptides, which are produced by some bloom-forming cyanobacteria in water. More than 100 different MCs variants posing a great threat to animals and humans due to their potential carcinogenicity have been reported. To reduce MCs risks, the World Health Organization has set a provisional guideline of 1 mu g/L MCs in human's drinking water. This paper provides an overview of exposure routes of MCs into the human system and health effects on different organs after MCs exposure including the liver, intestine, brain, kidney, lung, heart and reproductive system. In addition, some evidences on human poisoning and deaths associated with MCs exposure are presented. Finally, in order to protect human life against the health threats posed by MCs, this paper also suggests some directions for future research that can advance MCs control and minimize human exposure to MCs.

AB Snakebite envenoming is a serious problem in Myanmar. The great majority of snakebite in this country is due to Russell's Viper (Daboia siamensis). For many years, the Burma Pharmaceutical Industry has produced a monovalent antivenom to Russell's Viper in horses. At present, the only way of determining the level of antibody against D. siamensis venom in hyperimmune horse serum is to perform venom neutralisation tests in mice. In this study, we describe the development of an in vitro ELISA assay to estimate neutralising capacity of horse serum. We found a strong correlation between the ELISA assay and the venom neutralisation test in mice (r = 0.982). The assay is robust and has sufficient sensitivity (92%) and specificity (96%) to replace the venom neutralisation test in mice during the immunisation phase in horses.

AB A highly efficient electrolysis catalyzed ozone (ECO) process was developed for N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAC) degradation. The pseudo-first-order rate constants (kobs) of DMAC degradation by ECO process were 1.73-19.09 times greater than those by ozonation and electrolysis processes in a wide pH range of 3.0-10.0. Interestingly, we found O-2(center dot-) could be generated from ozone decomposition by a radical chain mechanism instead of monovalent reduction of 02 in ECO system at the initial pH of 3.0. Subsequently, the H2O2 derived from O-2(center dot-) could participate in Fenton-like and peroxone reactions with the released Fe2- from iron anode and the aerated O-3, respectively. Therefore, the extraordinary DMAC removal efficiency was mainly caused by the more generation of center dot OH through the multiple reactions of homogeneous catalytic ozonation, Fenton-like and peroxone in ECO system. Importantly, the roles of involved reactions in ECO system at various initial pH were quantitatively evaluated according to a series of trapping experiments. The results reveal that the solution pH could significantly affect the contributions of various reactions and convert the reaction mechanisms of multiple reactions in ECO system. Finally, the degradation intermediates were detected to propose a possible DMAC oxidation pathway in the ECO system. This work provides a deep insight into the quantitative analysis of the role of multiple oxidation reactions mechanism and the design of efficient electrochemical advanced oxidation technology for recalcitrant organic pollutant removal.

AB A wide variety of inhibitors can induce anaerobic digester disruption. To avoid performance losses, support media can be used to mitigate inhibitions. However, distinguishing the physico-chemical from the biological mechanisms of such strategies remains delicate. In this framework, the impact of 10 g/L of different types of zeolites and activated carbons (AC) on microbial community dynamics during anaerobic digestion of biowaste in the presence of 1.3 g/L of phenol was evaluated with 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. In the presence of AC, methanogenesis inhibition was rapidly removed due to a decrease of phenol concentration. This abiotic effect related to the physico-chemical properties of AC led to increased final CH4 and CO2 productions by 29-31% compared to digesters incubated without support. Interestingly, although zeolite did not adsorb phenol, final CH4 and CO2 production reached comparable levels as with AC. Nevertheless, compared to digesters incubated without support, methanogenesis lag phase duration was less reduced in the presence of zeolites (5 +/- 1 days) than in the presence of activated carbons (12 +/- 2 days). Both types of support induced biotic effects. AC and zeolite both allowed the preservation of the major representative archaeal genus of the non-inhibited ecosystem, Methanosarcina. By contrast, they distinctly shaped bacterial populations. OTUs belonging to class W5 became dominant at the expense of OTUs assigned to orders Clostridiales, Bacteroidales and Anaerolinales in the presence of AC. Zeolite enhanced the implantation of OTUs assigned to bacterial phylum Cloacimonetes. This study highlighted that supports can induce biotic and abiotic effects within digesters inhibited with phenol, showing potentialities to enhance anaerobic digestion stability under disrupting conditions.

AB The transportation and sedimentation of particulate phosphorus (PP) in a huge reservoir such as the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) are closely related to the phosphorus distribution characteristics and nutritional status of the water body. In this study, the PP distribution, sedimentation, and bioavailability in the mainstream section of the TGR were investigated through a field survey, indoor simulated settlement experiment, and historical data analysis. The results indicated that PP was the major component of the total phosphorus (TP) and that the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) trapped nearly 76.25% of suspended sediment (SS) and 75.35% of PP in the TGR, even during the flood season. A decline in flow velocity promoted the deposition of PP; additionally, PP concentrations gradually dropped from 0.35 mg/L in Chongqing to 0.02 mg/L in Zigui. The static PP sedimentation process adequately fitted a pseudo-second-order kinetic equation with a maximum correlation coefficient of 0.97. Moreover, more than half of the PP sedimentation process was achieved in less than 60 min for samples collected from the upper river reaches within simulated sedimentation process. The median particle size of SS and absolute value of the water column's zeta potential were negatively and positively related to the t(1/2) values of PP sedimentation, respectively. Compared with the concentration and particle size of SS obtained in the pre-TGR period, the values in the mainstream section of the TGR were lower. However, the TP and Fe/Al-P contents in SS increased several times. Due to the combined effects of flow velocity reduction and SS trapping, the water transparency and bioavailability of water column phosphorus were enhanced. Thus, the risk of water bloom outburst significantly increased when the impounded water level of 175 m in the TGR became the normal state. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aquatic environment is continually exposed to a complex mixture of chemicals, whereby effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are one key source. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether environmental risk assessments (ERAs) addressing individual substances are sufficiently protective for such coincidental mixtures. Based on a literature review of chemicals reported to occur in municipal WWTP effluents and mode-of-action considerations, four different types of mixtures were composed containing human pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and chemicals regulated under REACH. The experimentally determined chronic aquatic toxicity of these mixtures towards primary producers and the invertebrate Daphnia magna could be adequately predicted by the concept of concentration addition, with up to 5-fold overestimation and less than 3-fold underestimation of mixture toxicity. Effluents of a municipal WWTP had no impact on the predictability of mixture toxicity and showed no adverse effects on the test organisms. Predictive ERAs for the individual mixture components based on here derived predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC5) and median measured concentrations in WWTP effluents (MCeff) indicated no unacceptable risk for any of the individual chemicals, while MCeff/PNEC summation indicated a possible risk for multi-component mixtures. However, a refined mixture assessment based on the sum of toxic units at species level indicated no unacceptable risks, and allowed for a safety margin of more than factor 10, not taking into account any dilution of WWTP effluents by surface waters. Individual substances, namely climbazole, fenofibric acid and fluoxetine, were dominating the risks of the investigated mixtures, while added risk due to the mixture was found to be low with the risk quotient being increased by less than factor 2. Yet, uncertainty remains regarding chronic mixture toxicity in fish, which was not included in the present study. The number and identity of substances composing environmental mixtures such as WWTP effluents is typically unknown. Therefore, a mixture assessment factor is discussed as an option for a prospective ERA of mixtures of unknown composition. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In cold areas, nitrogen removal performance of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) declines greatly in winter. This paper systematically describes the enhancement effect of a periodic reverse electrocoagulation technology on biological nitrogen removal at low temperatures. The study showed that in the lab-scale systems, the electrocoagulation technology improved the biomass amount, enzyme activity and the amount of nitrogen removal bacteria (Nitrosomonas, Nitrobacter, Paracoccus, Thauera and Enterobacter). This enhanced nitrification and denitrification of activated sludge at low temperatures. In the pilot -scale systems, the electrocoagulation technology increased the relative abundance of cold adapted microorganisms (Luteimonas and Trueperaceae) at low temperatures. In a full-scale industrial WWTP, comparison of data from winter 2015 and winter 2016 showed that effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH4+-N, and NO3-N reduced by 10.37, 3.84, and 136.43 t, respectively, throughout the winter, after installation of electrocoagulation devices. These results suggest that the electrocoagulation technology is able to improve the performance of activated sludge under low-temperature conditions. This technology provides a new way for upgrading of the performance of WWTPs in cold areas. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Legacy lead and copper components are ubiquitous in plumbing of large buildings including schools that serve children most vulnerable to lead exposure. Lead and copper samples must be collected after varying stagnation times and interpreted in reference to different thresholds. A total of 130 outlets (fountains, bathroom and kitchen taps) were sampled for dissolved and particulate lead as well as copper. Sampling was conducted at 8 schools and 3 institutional (non-residential) buildings served by municipal water of varying corrosivity, with and without corrosion control (CC), and without a lead service line. Samples included first draw following overnight stagnation (>8h), partial (30 s) and fully (5 min) flushed, and first draw after 30 min of stagnation. Total lead concentrations in first draw samples after overnight stagnation varied widely from 0.07 to 19.9 mu g Pb/L (median: 1.7 mu g Pb/L) for large buildings served with non-corrosive water. Higher concentrations were observed in schools with corrosive water without CC (0.9-201 mu g Pb/L, median: 14.3 mu g Pb/L), while levels in schools with CC ranged from 0.2 to 45.1 mu g Pb/L (median: 2.1 mu g Pb/L). Partial flushing (30 s) and full flushing (5 min) reduced concentrations by 88% and 92% respectively for corrosive waters without CC. Lead concentrations were <10 mu g Pb/L in all samples following 5 min of flushing. However, after only 30 min of stagnation, first draw concentrations increased back to >45% than values in 1st draw samples collected after overnight stagnation. Concentrations of particulate Pb varied widely (>= 0.02-846 mu g Pb/L) and was found to be the cause of very high total Pb concentrations in the 2% of samples exceeding 50 mu g Pb/L. Pb levels across outlets within the same building varied widely (up to 1000X) especially in corrosive water (0.85 -851 mu g Pb/L after 30MS) confirming the need to sample at each outlet to identify high risk taps. Based on the much higher concentrations observed in first draw samples, even after a short stagnation, the first 250mL should be discarded unless no sources of lead are present. Results question the cost-benefit of daily or weekly flushing as a remediation strategy. As such, current regulatory requirements may fail to protect children as they may not identify problematic taps and effective mitigation measures. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this work was to elucidate the microbial ecology in twelve mesophilic and thermophilic full-scale biogas plants using a genome-centric metagenomic approach. In this study both biogas plants treating manure and those treating sludge from waste water treatment plants were considered. The identification of 132 Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) and analysis of their abundance profile in different samples allowed the identification of the most abundant core members of the anaerobic digestion microbiome. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to determine the influence of biotic and environmental factors on MAGs abundance and to investigate the methanogenic performance of the biogas plants. Prediction of the functional properties of MAGs was obtained analyzing their KEGG pathways and their carbohydrate active domains. Network analysis allowed investigation of species-species associations and shed light on syntrophic interactions between members belonging to the anaerobic digestion dark matter (phylum Fermentibacteria). By stratifying and comparing different levels of information, it was predicted that some MAGs have a crucial role in the manure-supplemented thermophilic biogas plants and it was highlighted the importance of the glycine cleavage system in complementing the "truncated" Wood-Ljungdahl pathway.

AB Nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI) has been proposed to remediate heavy metal ions in the subsurface. However, the fate of metal-nZVI hybrid has not been fully investigated. In this study, we investigated (1) the long-term removal performance of nZVI for molybdate (Mo(VI)); (2) the relationship between the ageing of Mo-nZVI hybrid in specific solution chemistries and the remobilization of Mo(VI) from the hybrid; and (3) the effects of Mo-nZVI hybrid on cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa). Results showed that although common ions have limited influence on the removal ratio of Mo(VI) by nZVI, they do impact the structure evolution and transformation of the Mo-nZVI nanohybrid formed thereafter. Ageing time was crucial for the chemical stabilization of Mo-nZVI hybrid, but common groundwater ions retarded the stabilizing process, which may lead to a significant remobilization of Mo(VI) from the hybrid after exposure to water bodies. While low levels of Mo(VI) ions could stimulate the growth of M. aeruginosa, aged Mo-nZVI hybrid inhibited the growth of M. aeruginosa, except when ageing occurred in the presence of HPO42-/CO32- (which also retarded hybrid stabilization). This study shows that nZVI can immobilize Mo(VI) ions in groundwater, and the derived metal-nZVI hybrid can effectively suppress the potential growth of M. aeruginosa in river water.

AB An autocatalytic system, permanganate-ultrasonic (PM-US) system, was applied to degrade perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in aqueous solutions. After a 120-min ultrasonication, a PM dosage of 6 mM increased the pseudo first-order rate constant (k(1)) for PFOA decomposition from 3.5 x 10(-3) to 13.0 x 10(-3) min(-1) and increased the pseudo zeroth-order rate constant (k(2)) for PFOA defluorination from 1.5 x 10(-3) to 7.9 x 10(-3) mM.min(-1), respectively. The PFOA degradation rates increased proportionally with the enhanced production rates of MnO2 particles. An initial pH 4 condition was optimal for the PFOA degradation compared to highly acidic and neutral conditions. PFOA degradation could be significantly facilitated by increasing power density of ultrasonication from 60 to 180 W.L-1. While increasing solution temperature to 50 degrees C only slightly promoted the PFOA decomposition and defluorination to 1.15 and 1.07 times of that at 30 degrees C, respectively. The solution saturated with argon was more favorable for the PFOA degradation in the PM-US system than that saturated with air and oxygen. Co-dissolved Cu(II), Fe(II) and Fe(III) ions inhibited the PFOA degradation by forming metal-PFOA complexes. Based on the experimental results and intermediates analysis, mechanisms and pathways of PFOA decomposition and defluorination in the PM-US system were proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The hyporheic zone (HZ) is often considered to efficiently remove polar trace organic compounds (TrOCs) from lotic systems, mitigating potential adverse effects of TrOCs on ecosystem functioning and drinking water production. Predicting the fate of TrOCs in the hyporheic zone (HZ) is difficult as the in-situ removal rate constants are not known and the biogeochemical factors as well as hydrological conditions controlling the removal efficiency are not fully understood. To determine the in-situ removal efficiency of the HZ for a variety of TrOCs as a function of the biogeochemical milieu, we conducted a field study in an urban river near Berlin, Germany. Subsurface flow was studied by time series of temperature depth profiles and the biogeochemical milieu of the HZ by concentration depth profiles. These results, in conjunction with a 1D advection-dispersion transport model, were used to calculate first-order removal rate constants of several polar TrOCs in the HZ. For the majority of TrOCs investigated, removal rate constants were strongly dependent on redox conditions, with significantly higher removal rates observed under predominantly suboxic (i.e. denitrifying) compared to anoxic (i.e. Fe and Mn reducing) conditions. Compared to previous studies on the fate of TrOCs in saturated sediments, half-lives within oxic/suboxic sections of the HZ were relatively low, attributable to the site-specific characteristics of the HZ in a stream dominated by wastewater treatment plant effluent. For nine out of thirteen investigated TrOCs, concentrations decreased significantly in the HZ with relative removal percentages ranging from 32% for primidone to 77% for gabapentin. For many TrOCs, removal efficiency decreased drastically as redox conditions became anoxic. For the majority of compounds investigated here, the HZ indeed acts as an efficient bioreactor that is capable of removing TrOCs along relatively short flow paths. Depending on the TrOC, removal capacity may be enhanced by either increasing the magnitude of groundwater-surface exchange fluxes, by increasing the total residence time in the HZ or the exposure time to suboxic zones, respectively.

AB Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) of 41 N-containing compounds was examined under a stable temperature and pressure of 450 degrees C and 24 MPa, respectively, reaction time ranged from 0.5 to 6 min with 500% excess oxygen, resulted in the degradation rate constants of total organic carbon (k(TOC)) and total nitrogen (k(TN)) were 0.162-3.693 and 0.065-0.416 min(-1), respectively. The N-containing products were primary N-2, ammonium and nitrate. As for amino-group compounds, the main product was ammonia, while for nitro-group compounds, nitrate was the predominant. In terms of diazo and N-heterocyclic group compounds, the main products generally were nitrate and ammonium, respectively. Interestingly, 2-, 3- and 4-nitroaniline, containing both of nitro and amino group, would directly decompose into N2. The reaction pathways of acid orange 74 was proposed based on Fukui indices, which generally included denitrification, ring-open and mineralization. Density functional theory (DFT) method was applied to calculate the quantum properties of the 41 N-containing compounds in order to further examine the relationship between TN removal and molecular structural characteristics. The correlation result showed that among all the 17 molecular characteristics, F(+)(n), F(-)(n). F(0)(n), and E-HOMO achieved high correlation coefficients. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Dissolved Mn(III) has been identified at all stages throughout a Water Treatment Works (WTW) receiving inflow from a peaty upland catchment in NE England. Ninety percent of the influent total manganese into the WTW is particulate Mn, in the form of Mn oxide (>0.2 mu m). Approximately 9% (mean value, n = 22, range of 0-100%) of the dissolved (<0.2 mu m) influent Mn is present as dissolved Mn(III). Mn(III) concentrations are highest (mean of 49% of total dissolved Mn; n = 26, range of 17-89%) within the WTW where water comes into contact with the organic-rich sludges which are produced as waste products in the WTW. These Mn(III)-containing wastewaters are recirculated to the head of the works and constitute a large input of Mn(III) into the WTW. This is the first report of Mn(III) being identified in a WTW. The ability of Mn(III) to act as both an oxidant and a reductant is of interest to the water industry. Understanding the formation and removal of Mn(III) within may help reduce Mn oxide deposits in pipe networks. Further understanding how the ratio of Mn(III) to Mn(II) can be used to optimise dissolved Mn removal would save the water industry significant money in reducing discoloration 'events' at the customers' tap.

AB Electrochemical disinfection (ECD) has become an important blackwater disinfection technology. ECD is a promising solution for the 2 billion people without access to conventional sanitation practices and in areas deficient in basic utilities (e.g., sewers, electricity, waste treatment). Here, we report on the disinfection of blackwater using potential cycling compared to potentiostatic treatment methods in chloride-containing and chloride-free solutions of blackwater (i.e., untreated wastewater containing feces, urine, and flushwater from a toilet). Potentiodynamic treatment is demonstrated to improve disinfection energy efficiency of blackwater by 24% and 124% compared to static oxidation and reduction methods, respectively. The result is shown to be caused by electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOP) and regeneration of sp2-surface-bonded carbon functional groups that serve the dual purpose of catalysts and adsorption sites of oxidant intermediates. Following 24 h electrolysis in blackwater, electrode fouling is shown to be minimized by the potential cycling method when compared to equivalent potentiostatic methods. The potential cycling current density is 40% higher than both the static oxidative and reductive methods. This work enhances the understanding of oxygen reduction catalysts using functionalized carbon materials and electrochemical disinfection anodes, both of which have the potential to bring a cost-effective, energy efficient, and practical solution to the problem of disinfecting blackwater.

AB In this work, solar disinfection (SODIS) was enhanced by moderate addition of Fe and sodium peroxydisulfate (PDS), under solar light. A systematic assessment of the activating factors was performed, firstly isolated, then in pairs and concluded in the combined Fe/heat/solar UV-PDS activation process. Solar light was the most effective (single) activator, and its combination with Fe and heat (double activation) yielded high level of synergies (up to S = 2.13). The triple activation was able to reduce the bacterial load up to 6-log in less than 1 h, similarly to the photo-Fenton process done in comparison (SODIS alone: >5 h). Fe-oxides were suitable activators of PDS under the same conditions while the presence of organic matter enhanced bacterial inactivation by the triple activated PDS process. The degradation of a (selected) mixture of micropollutants (i.e. drugs, pesticides) was also achieved in similar order of magnitude, and faster than the photo-Fenton process. Finally, the removal of a viral pathogen indicator (MS2 bacteriophage) was attained at minute-range residence times. The aforementioned facts indicate the suitability of the mild, combined process, as a potential SODIS enhancement, producing safe drinking water for sunny and especially for developing countries.

AB Fenton's reagent has been widely used to enhance sludge dewaterability. However, drawbacks associated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in Fenton's reagents exist, since it is a hazardous chemical and shows carcinogenicity, explosivity, instability, and corrosivity. Moreover, initial acidification and subsequent neutralization are needed as optimal conditions for homogeneous Fenton conditioning and final filtrate discharge. In this study, a Fenton-like process for the enhanced dewaterability of waste activated sludge with in-situ generation of H2O2 and without extra pH adjustment was firstly proposed, namely citric acid (CA)-assisted oxygen activation in an air/nano zero-valent iron (nZVI) system and chemical re coagulation with polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDMDAAC). Using the response surface methodology (RSM), the optimal doses of CA, nZVI, and PDMDAAC were determined to be 13, 33, and 9 mg g(-1) dry solids (DS), respectively. This composite conditioner showed a good dewatering capability compared with the raw sludge, e.g. the capillary suction time decreased from 130.0 to 9.5 s. The enhanced sludge dewaterability was further confirmed by laboratory-scale diaphragm filter press dewatering tests, which produced a lower cake moisture content compared with the raw sludge, and the final pH of the filtrate was close to neutrality. The citric acid promoted the production of H2O2 and Fe(II)/Fe(III) species, the degradation of protein in tightly-bound extracellular polymeric substances, and the decomposition of protein-N in the solid phase of sludge, resulting a greater conversion of bound water to free water. The results of electron spin resonance indicated that the hydroxyl radicals were mainly responsible for the decomposition of proteinaceous compounds. The subsequent chemical re-coagulation with PDMDAAC can make the zeta potential of sludge samples less negative, reduce the repulsive electrostatic interactions, and agglomerate the smaller particles into larger aggregates, thus enhancing sludge dewaterability.

AB This study characterized the dissolved organic matter (DOM) and byproducts generated after the exposure of activated sludge to ozone and NaClO in ceramic MBR. It was found that NaClO triggered more significant release of DOM than ozone. Proteins with the molecular weight greater than 20 kDa and humic acid like-substances were the principal components of DOM generated by NaClO, while ozone was found to effectively degrade larger biopolymers to low molecular weight substances. The results showed that more than 80% of DOM generated by NaClO and ozone could pass through the 0.2-mu m ceramic membrane. Furthermore, total organic chlorine (TOCl) was determined to be the principal species of halogenated byproducts in both cases, while the generation of TOCl by NaClO was much more significant than that by ozone. Only a small fraction of TOCl was removed by the 0.2-mu m ceramic membrane. More importantly, the toxic bioassays further revealed that the supernatant of sludge suspension and permeate in the MBR with NaClO cleaning exhibited higher developmental toxicity to the polychaete embryos than those by ozone. The results clearly showed that on-line chemical cleaning with ozone should be a more eco-friendly and safer approach for sustaining long-term membrane permeability in ceramic MBR.

AB Controlling of antibiotics is the crucial step for preventing antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) dissemination; UV photocatalysis has been identified as a promising pre-treatment technology for antibiotics removal. However, information about the effects of intermediates present in the treated antibiotics wastewater on the downstream biological treatment processes or ARGs development is very limited. In the present study, continuous UVA/LED/TiO2 photocatalysis removed more than 90% of 100 ppb sulfamethoxazole (SMX)/trimethoprim (TMP), the treated wastewater was fed into SBR systems for over one year monitoring. Residual SMX/TMP (2-3 ppb) and intermediates present in the treated wastewater did not adversely affect SBR performance in terms of TOC and TN removal. SMX and TMP resistance genes (sulI, sulII, sulIII, dfrII, dfrV and dfr13) were also quantified in SBRs microbial consortia. Results suggested that continuous feeding of treated SMX/TMP containing wastewaters did not trigger any ARGs promotion during the one year operation. By stopping the input of 100 ppb SMX/TMP, abundance of sulII and dfrV genes were reduced by 83% and 100%, respectively. sun gene was identified as the most persistence ARG, and controlling of 100 ppb SMX input did not achieve significant removal of sull gene. A significant correlation between sull gene and class 1 integrons was found at the level of p = 1.4E-10 (r = 0.94), and sulII gene positively correlated with the plasmid transfer efficiency (r = 2.442E-10, r = 0.87). Continuous input of 100 ppb SMX enhanced plasmid transfer efficiency in the SBR system, resulting in sulII gene abundance increasing more than 40 times. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The elimination of potentially pathogenic bacteria in. wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) attracts much attention in public health. Reports on the occurrence of the emerging hospital pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii in wastewaters do not include a continuous monitoring at all WWTP stages. The objective of this study was to characterize A. baumannii recovered from the water and sludge line of the secondary WWTP in Zagreb, Croatia over the period of one year. Recovery of A. baumannii was performed using CHROMagar Acinetobacter plates. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed with broth microdilution and results interpreted using EUCAST breakpoints for clinical isolates of A. baumannii. Molecular characterization was performed by WGS and cgMLST. The secondary WWTP treating the urban wastewater is constantly receiving viable A. baumannii along with genes encoding carbapenem resistance, and emitting them via effluent into the environment. Furthermore, A. baumannii from influent are incorporated into activated sludge flocs in aeration basin. A. baumannii can survive the technological process of anaerobic mesophilic sludge digestion, and is finally destroyed in alkaline lime-treated stabilized sludge. The majority (102/119) of A. baumannii isolates were carbapenem-resistant, while antibiotic-susceptible isolates (17/119) were rarely recovered from all WWTP stages. Carbapenem-resistant isolates belonged to international clonal lineage IC2 carrying OXA-23 and IC1 carrying OXA-72, while the susceptible isolates belonged to IC5 or were unclustered. Increased resistance to antibiotics, together with the appearance of carbapenem- and even pandrug-resistant isolates in effluent as compared to influent wastewater, suggests the need of additional disinfection of effluent prior to its discharge into the natural recipient.

AB Mine drainage contaminated with metals is a major environmental threat since it is a source of water pollution with devastating effects on aquatic ecosystems. Conventional active treatment technologies are prohibitively expensive and so there is increasing demand to develop reliable, cost-effective and sustainable passive or semi-passive treatment. These are promising alternatives since they leverage the metabolism of microorganisms native to the disturbed site at in situ or close to in situ conditions. Since this is a biological approach, it is not clear if semi-passive treatment would be effective in remote locations with extremely cold weather such as at mines in the subarctic. In this study we tested the hypothesis that sulfate-reducing bacteria, which are microorganisms that promote metal precipitation, exist in subarctic mine environments and their activity can be stimulated by adding a readily available carbon source. An experiment was setup at a closed mine in the Yukon Territory, Canada, where leaching of Zn and Cd occurs. To test if semi-passive treatment could precipitate these metals and prevent further leaching from waste rock, molasses as a carbon source was added to anaerobic bioreactors mimicking the belowground in-situ conditions. Microbial community analysis confirmed that sulfate-reducing bacteria became enriched in the bioreactors upon addition of molasses. The population composition remained fairly stable over the 14 month operating period despite temperature shifts from 17 to 5 degrees C. Sulfate reduction functionality was confirmed by quantification of the gene for dissimilatory sulfite reductase. Metals were removed from underground mine drainage fed into the bioreactors with Zn removal efficiency varying between 20.9% in winter and 89.3% in summer, and Cd removal efficiency between 39% in winter and 90.5% in summer. This study demonstrated that stimulation of native SRB in MIW was possible and that in situ semi-passive treatment can be effective in removing metals despite the cold climate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Freshwater cyanobacterial blooms are becoming increasingly problematic in regions that rely on surface waters for drinking water production. Microcystins (MCs) are toxic peptides produced by multiple cyanobacterial genera with a global occurrence. Cyanobacteria also produce a variety of other toxic and/or otherwise bioactive peptides (TBPs) that have gained less attention including cyanopeptolins (Cpts), anabaenopeptins (Apts), and microginins (Mgn). In this study, we compared temporal and spatial trends of four MCs (MCLR, MCRR, MCYR, MCLA), three Cpts (Cpt1020, Cpt1041, Cpt1007), two Apts (AptF, AptB), and Mgn690 in raw drinking water and at six surface water locations above these drinking water intakes in a eutrophic lake. All four MC congeners and five of six TBPs were detected in lake and raw drinking water. Across all samples, MCLR was the most frequently detected metabolite (100% of samples) followed by MCRR (97%) > Cpt1007 (74%) > MCYR (69%) > AptF (67%) > MCLA (61%) > AptB (54%) > Mgn690 (29%) and Cpt1041 (15%). Mean concentrations of MCs, Apts, and Cpts into two drinking water intakes were 3.9 +/- 4.7, 0.14 +/- 0.21, and 0.38 +/- 0.92, respectively. Mean concentrations in surface water were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in drinking water intakes for MCs but not for Cpts and Apts. Temporal trends in MCs, Cpts, and Apts in the two raw drinking water intakes were significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with measures of cell abundance (chlorophyll-alpha, Microcystis cell density), UV absorbance, and turbidity in surface water. This study expands current information about cyanobacterial TBPs that occur in lakes and that enter drinking water treatment plants and underscores the need to determine the fate of less studied cyanobacterial metabolites during drinking water treatment that may exacerbate toxicity of more well-known cyanobacterial toxins.

AB Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are recognized as one of the most serious emerging micropollutants. Wastewater treatment plants are the major way through which such contaminants enter the environment. Therefore, an appropriate management of PhACs in these facilities can reduce their release into the environment. In particular, a proper sampling methodology is necessary to identify and quantify micropollutants in wastewater. In this study, 37 pharmaceuticals (including 23 antibiotics) are investigated in eight major wastewater treatment plants in Beijing. An optimized sampling methodology is successfully implemented to monitor bihourly variation of the contaminants, thus averting uncertainties derived from conventional sampling methods. In this way, more accurate pharmaceutical load patterns are determined and discussed. Thanks to the synchronous data on pharmaceutical concentration and wastewater flow, we also compare performances of various treatment processes and optimize different calculation methods for removal efficiency.

AB Charge transfer and mass transport are two underlying mechanisms which are coupled in desalination dynamics using capacitive deionization (CDI). We developed simple reduced-order models based on a mixed reactor volume principle which capture the coupled dynamics of CDI operation using closed-form semi-analytical and analytical solutions. We use the models to identify and explore self-similarities in the dynamics among flow rate, current, and voltage for CDI cell operation including both charging and discharging cycles. The similarity approach identifies the specific combination of cell (e.g. capacitance, resistance) and operational parameters (e.g. flow rate, current) which determine a unique effluent dynamic response. We here demonstrate self-similarity using a conventional flow between CDI (fbCDI) architecture, and we hypothesize that our similarity approach has potential application to a wide range of designs. We performed an experimental study of these dynamics and used well-controlled experiments of CDI cell operation to validate and explore limits of the model. For experiments, we used a CDI cell with five electrode pairs and a standard flow between (electrodes) architecture. Guided by the model, we performed a series of experiments that demonstrate natural response of the CDI system. We also identify cell parameters and operation conditions which lead to self-similar dynamics under a constant current forcing function and perform a series of experiments by varying flowrate, currents, and voltage thresholds to demonstrate self-similarity. Based on this study, we hypothesize that the average differential electric double layer (EDL) efficiency (a measure of ion adsorption rate to EDL charging rate) is mainly dependent on user-defined voltage thresholds, whereas flow efficiency (measure of how well desalinated water is recovered from inside the cell) depends on cell volumes flowed during charging, which is determined by flowrate, current and voltage thresholds. Results of experiments strongly support this hypothesis. Results show that cycle efficiency and salt removal for a given flowrate and current are maximum when average EDL and flow efficiencies are approximately equal. We further explored a range of CC operations with varying flowrates, currents, and voltage thresholds using our similarity variables to highlight trade-offs among salt removal, energy, and throughput performance.

AB Trace elements were commonly used as additives to facilitate anaerobic digestion. However, their addition is often blind because of the complexity of reaction conditions, which has impeded their widespread application. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate deficiencies in trace elements during anaerobic digestion by establishing relationships between changes in trace element bioavailability (the degree to which elements are available for interaction with biological systems) and digestion performance. To accomplish this, two batch experiments were conducted. In the first, sequential extraction was used to detect changes in trace element fractions and then to evaluate trace element bioavailability in the whole digestion cycle. In the second batch experiment, trace elements (Co, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, Mo and Se) were added to the reaction system at three concentrations (low, medium and high) and their effects were monitored. The results showed that sequential extraction was a suitable method for assessment of the bioavailability of trace elements (appropriate coefficient of variation and recovery rate). The results revealed that Se had the highest (44.2%-70.9%) bioavailability, while Fe had the lowest (1.7%-3.0%). A lack of trace elements was not directly related to their absolute bioavailability, but was instead associated with changes in their bioavailability throughout the digestion cycle. Trace elements were insufficient when their bioavailability was steady or increased over the digestion cycle. These results indicate that changes in trace element bioavailability during the digestion cycle can be used to predict their deficiency. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Highly acidic phosphogypsum wastes with elevated potential for contaminant leaching are stack-piled near coastal areas worldwide, threatening the adjacent environment. Huge phosphogypsum stacks were disposed directly on the marshes of the Estuary of Huelva (SW Spain) without any impermeable barrier to prevent leaching and thus, contributing to the total contamination of the estuarine environment. According to the previous weathering model, the process water ponded on the surface of the stack, initially used to carry the waste, was thought to be the main washing agent through its infiltration and subsequently the main component of the leachates emerging as the edge outflows. Preliminary restorations have been applied to the site and similar ones are planned for the future considering process water as the only pollution agent. Further investigation to validate the pollution pathway was necessary, thus an evaluation of the relationship between leachates and weathering agents of the stack was carried out using stable isotopes (delta O-18, delta H-2, and delta S-34) as geochemical tracers. Quantification of the contribution of all possible end-members to the phosphogypsum leachates was also conducted using ternary mixing via the stable isotopic tracers. The results ruled out ponded process water as main vector of edge outflow pollution and unveiled a continuous infiltration of estuarine waters to the stack implying that is subjected to an open weathering system. The isotopic tracers revealed a progressive contribution downstream from fluvial to marine signatures in the composition of the edge outflows, depending on the location of each disposal zone within the different estuarine morphodynamic domains. Thus, the current study suggests that the access of intertidal water inside the phosphogypsum stack, for instance through secondary tidal channels, is the main responsible for the weathering of the waste in depth, underlying the necessity for new, more effective restorations plans.

AB Tetra-amido macrocyclic ligand (TAML) activator is a functional analog of peroxidase enzymes, which activates hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to form high valence iron-oxo complexes that selectively degrade persistent aromatic organic contaminants (ACs) in water. Here, we develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models based on measured pseudo first-order kinetic rate coefficients (k(obs)) of 29 ACs (e.g., phenols and pharmaceuticals) oxidized by TAML/H2O2 at neutral and basic pH values to gain mechanistic insight on the selectivity and pH dependence of TAML/H2O2 systems. These QSAR models infer that electron donating ability (E-HOMO) is the most important AC characteristic for TAML/H2O2 oxidation, pointing to a rate-limiting single-electron transfer (SET) mechanism. Oxidation rates at pH 7 also depend on AC reactive indices such as f(min)(-) and qH(+), which respectively represent propensity for electrophilic attack and the most positive net atomic charge on hydrogen atoms. At pH 10, TAML/H2O2 is more reactive towards ACs with a lower hydrogen to carbon atoms ratio (#H:C), suggesting the significance of hydrogen atom abstraction. In addition, In k(obs) of 14 monosubstituted phenols is negatively correlated with Hammett constants (sigma) and exhibits similar sensitivity to substituent effects as horseradish peroxidase. Although accurately predicting degradation rates of specific ACs in complex wastewater matrices could be difficult, these QSAR models are statistically robust and help predict both relative degradability and reaction mechanism for TAML/H2O2-based treatment processes.

AB Multivariate statistical analysis was applied to investigate the dependencies and underlying patterns between N2O emissions and online operational variables (dissolved oxygen and nitrogen component concentrations, temperature and influent flow-rate) during biological nitrogen removal from wastewater. The system under study was a full-scale reactor, for which hourly sensor data were available. The 15-month long monitoring campaign was divided into 10 sub-periods based on the profile of N2O emissions, using Binary Segmentation. The dependencies between operating variables and N2O emissions fluctuated according to Spearman's rank correlation. The correlation between N2O emissions and nitrite concentrations ranged between 0.51 and 0.78. Correlation >0.7 between N2O emissions and nitrate concentrations was observed at sub-periods with average temperature lower than 12 degrees C. Hierarchical k-means clustering and principal component analysis linked N2O emission peaks with precipitation events and ammonium concentrations higher than 2 mg/L, especially in sub-periods characterized by low N2O fluxes. Additionally, the highest ranges of measured N2O fluxes belonged to clusters corresponding with NO3-N concentration less than 1 mg/L in the upstream plug-flow reactor (middle of oxic zone), indicating slow nitrification rates. The results showed that the range of N2O emissions partially depends on the prior behavior of the system. The principal component analysis validated the findings from the clustering analysis and showed that ammonium, nitrate, nitrite and temperature explained a considerable percentage of the variance in the system for the majority of the sub-periods. The applied statistical methods, linked the different ranges of emissions with the system variables, provided insights on the effect of operating conditions on N2O emissions in each sub-period and can be integrated into N2O emissions data processing at wastewater treatment plants.

AB Rice is the main staple carbohydrate source for billions of people worldwide. Natural geogenic and anthropogenic sources has led to high arsenic (As) concentrations in rice grains. This is because As is highly bioavailable to rice roots under conditions in which rice is cultivated. A multifaceted and interdisciplinary understanding, both of short-term and long-term effects, are required to identify spatial and temporal changes in As contamination levels in paddy soil-water systems. During flooding, soil pore waters are elevated in inorganic As compared to dryland cultivation systems, as anaerobism results in poorly mobile As(V), being reduced to highly mobile As(III). The formation of iron (Fe) plaque on roots, availability of metal (hydro)oxides (Fe and Mn), organic matter, clay mineralogy and competing ions and compounds (PO43- and Si(OH)(4)) are all known to influence As(V) and As(III) mobility in paddy soil-water environments. Microorganisms play a key role in As transformation through oxidation/reduction, and methylation/volatilization reactions, but transformation kinetics are poorly understood. Scientific-based optimization of all biogeochemical parameters may help to significantly reduce the bioavailability of inorganic As. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   recess; Sellar cyst; Third ventricle
ID EMPTY SELLA; HYPERPROLACTINEMIA; 3RD-VENTRICLE
AB BACKGROUND: Persisting embryonal infundibular recess (PEIR) is a rare anomaly of the third ventricular floor, with only 10 cases having been reported to date. Accurate imaging diagnosis of this entity is essential to avoid unnecessary surgery and its associated morbidity. The following case is presented to emphasize its recognition in the differential diagnosis of pituitary cystic lesions.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 38-year-old woman was referred for evaluation of a pituitary cystic mass. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 10.2-mm cystic mass in an enlarged sella turcica. Three-dimensional high-resolution MRI using constructive interference in steady-state sequence clearly delineated a communicating tract between the third ventricle and the sellar cyst through pituitary stalk. A final diagnosis of PEIR was made. The patient was managed successfully with conservative treatment, and the lesion was in a stationary condition over a 5-year follow-up period.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case report demonstrating imaging features of PEIR in 3-dimensional high-resolution MRI. Although PEIR is a rare anomaly, imaging diagnosis of this entity is important because confusion with other pituitary cystic lesions and the attempt of surgical removal may lead to serious complications.

AB OBJECTIVE: Particle therapy has been reported as an emerging radiotherapy for several tumors, but its effectiveness for chordoma remains to be studied. This meta-analysis was performed to compare the effectiveness of photon therapy, proton therapy, and carbon-ion therapy for chordoma.
   METHODS: Studies reporting the use of conventional radiotherapy (CRT), stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT), proton therapy, and carbon-ion therapy were identified in several databases. A fixed-effects model was used to perform a meta-analysis of 3-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival. The chi(2) test was used to compare pooled estimates for each treatment type.
   RESULTS: Twenty-five studies were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that the 3-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival rates were higher for SRT, proton therapy, and carbon-ion therapy than for CRT. The 10-year overall survival was higher for proton therapy than for SRT.
   CONCLUSIONS: We revealed that particle therapy was more effective following surgery for chordoma than CRT. After 10 years, proton therapy was more beneficial than SRT. However, future studies should include more studies to enable accurate meta-analysis and a better exploration of prognosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Resection of a vestibular schwannoma may result in facial paralysis and hearing loss on the side of the tumor. We evaluated clinical, audiologic, and intraoperative events and radiologic parameters in a case of contralateral side sensorineural hearing loss. We also performed a literature search using PubMed.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 25-year-old woman with neurofibromatosis 2 developed contralateral side sensorineural hearing loss immediately after resection of vestibular schwannoma. The patient regained partial hearing with a short course (2 months) of steroid therapy over 6 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: Literature search yielded 20 cases. We evaluated possible etiology, pattern, extent, recovery, and final outcome in these patients with management options. Several etiologies have been proposed, including development of endolymphatic hydrops, vascular phenomenon, mechanical injury, barotrauma, and autoimmune cochleolabyrinthitis. Sudden release of cerebrospinal fluid seemed to be the most likely explanation in the present case. There is no way to predict this complication beforehand. Operating in supine position, slow release of cerebrospinal fluid, irrigation of the operating field, maintenance of normotension, and judicious use of the drill may help in prevention. A short course of corticosteroids and vasodilators helped in spontaneous recovery in most of the cases.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite the progress achieved in recent years, the prognosis of patients with primary brain tumors remains poor. Research efforts have therefore focused on identifying more effective and minimally invasive treatment methods. Magnetic resonance-guided transcranial focused ultrasonography (MRgFUS) is a consolidated minimally invasive therapeutic technique, which has recently acquired a role also in the treatment of some nononcologic intracranial diseases.
   METHODS: We reviewed the latest studies to take stock of the potential of MRgFUS.
   RESULTS: The objective of the research in the last decade was to apply FUS also to the treatment of intracranial neoplastic diseases, using both the thermal effects (thermal ablation) and, above all, the ability to permeabilize the bloodbrain barrier and modify the tumor microenvironment. This strategy may allow the use of drugs that are poorly active on the central nervous system or active selectively at high doses, minimize the side effects, and substantially modify the prognosis of patients affected by these diseases.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the future, targeted drug delivery, immunotherapy, and gene therapy will probably become main players in the treatment of brain neoplasms, with the aid of MRgFUS. In this way, it will be possible to directly intervene on tumor cells and preserve healthy tissue.

AB BACKGROUND: Contributions on using navigation in neurosurgery have been shared widely. However, few authors have reported their experience identifying superficial vessels before dural opening using indocyanine green-video angiography. Furthermore, this technique has shown some limitations.
   METHODS: For many years, each time we planned a needle biopsy for brain tumors, we set the entry point and trajectory on the navigator before surgery. Regarding the target, we systematically chose both a trajectory, which should avoid any crossing with vessels, and an entry far from veins or granulations. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging T1-weighted sequences have been demonstrated to be adequate for this purpose. Note that we used the Medtronic StealthStation S8 (Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) and gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging T1-weighted sequences to plan 4 different surgical procedures (needle biopsy, parasagittal meningioma, double metastases, and high-grade glioma). Intra-operatively, after craniotomy and dural exposure, a Passive Planar Blunt Probe and dermographic pen were used to mark superficial vessels on the basis of navigational images. The dura was opened far from any marked line, vessels were dissected, and the dura was opened by a Penfield dissector and Metzenbaum scissors.
   RESULTS: The mean planning time length was 7 minutes, and the marking procedure time length was 3 minutes. Dural marks perfectly corresponded to the underlying vessels. The correspondence rate of marks to underlying vessels was 100%. No one vessel unmarked was noticed. No superficial vessel injuries were reported.
   CONCLUSIONS: This technique provides a safe and fast method to avoid vessel injuries during dural opening. Furthermore, it could be useful as an educational tool.

LA English
DT Article
DE Bow hunter's syndrome; Kimmerle anomaly; Ponticulus lateralis;
   Ponticulus posticus; Transmuscular approach; Vertebral artery
   decompression
ID ATLAS
AB BACKGROUND: Kimmerle anomaly is characterized by ossification of the posterior atlanto-occipital membrane with formation of a complete or incomplete bony ridge in the area of the groove for the vertebral artery (VA) (ponticulus posticus [PP]). In some cases, the bony ridge may also be formed at the level of the VA emerging from the transverse process of the C1 vertebra (ponticulus lateralis [PL]). Simultaneous 1-sided formation of PL and PP is very rare. Data concerning surgical treatment for compression of the VA owing to PL are lacking.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 34-year-old woman presented with significant dizziness to the point of losing consciousness while rotating her head to the left. Computed tomography angiography of the cervical spine revealed C1 anomaly with the formation of PP and PL with acute-angled C-shaped kinking of the VA. The patient underwent resection of the bony ridges through minimally invasive lateral (PP) and far-lateral (PL) approaches. Treatment led to significant improvement in quality of life, with disappearance of the pain syndrome via the C1 spinal root and absence of bow hunter's syndrome in the postoperative period.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to our knowledge on the surgical treatment of VA compression owing to PP and PL. VA decompression in such cases can be performed via 2 separate minimally invasive lateral and far-lateral approaches. Surgical strategies for treatment of Kimmerle anomaly may significantly improve patients' quality of life.

LA English
DT Article
DE Endonasal approach; Endoscopic skull base surgery; Neuronavigation;
   O-arm
ID PITUITARY-TUMORS; NAVIGATION; EXPERIENCE
AB BACKGROUND: In transsphenoidal endoscopic cranial base surgery, a precise navigational support may be crucial. This is particularly evident when tumors extend to the parasellar region or in recurrent tumors whereas normal anatomy has been altered by previous surgery/radiotherapy.
   METHODS: Previous unsatisfactory experiences with various navigation techniques in this type of surgery encouraged us to perform an endoscopic endonasal approach with an O-arm (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) assisted technique for the surgical treatment of 4 patients affected respectively by an orbital tumor and 3 cases of relapse of nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma, 1 of them localized in the infrasellar-clival region.
   RESULTS: The system O-arm-StealthStation allows for merging intraoperative bone 3-D acquisition with preoperative computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging and provides the surgeon with an extremely reliable operative navigational tool.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of an O-arm-assisted endoscopic surgery for cranial base tumors. Here we report on the feasibility and usefulness of such a new application of the O-arm: technical details, setting of the operating room, advantages, and limits of the method are also described.
   Our overall impression, considering the limited number of patients, is that use of the O-arm may be successfully extended to selected cases of cranial base tumors operated through an endoscopic endonasal approach.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to summarize the diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis of pituitary metastasis.
   METHODS: Ten patients from the Department of Neurosurgery of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital from April 1997 to August 2014 were retrospectively analyzed.
   RESULTS: The participants included 7 males (70%) and 3 females (30%), with an average age of 60.4 years. The most common initial clinical feature was visual disability (50%). The postoperative pathology reports indicated 1 case (10%) of metastatic large-cell pulmonary carcinoma, 2 cases (20%) of metastatic small cell pulmonary carcinoma, 2 cases (20%) of clear cell renal carcinoma metastasis, and 5 cases (50%) of metastasis of adenocarcinomas from different areas. All the patients underwent a thorough follow-up, and the average survival was 144 days.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pituitary metastasis is a rare disease. Its diagnosis depends on the clinical manifestations and radiologic results. The primary therapeutic method is surgery and subsequent radiotherapy and chemotherapy; however, the prognosis of this disease is poor.

AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial primary collision tumors of different histologic types are rare, and their occurrence is still unclear.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a 66-year-old female who presented with headache, nausea, and vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging scan showed that there were 2 primary intracranial tumors occurring simultaneously at adjacent sites of the right cerebral hemisphere. Tumor pathology showed 2 distinct tumors: meningioma (World Health Organization I) and glioblastoma. This is a rare case in which 2 different intracranial primary tumors occurred at adjacent sites, but the patient had no history of head trauma, neurologic surgery, or radiation therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: According to previous and present reports, the most common type of intracranial primary collision tumor is composed of a benign meningioma and a glioblastoma. During the occurrence of collision tumors, 1 tumor can play a role in the formation and growth of the other.

AB BACKGROUND: Papillary tumor of the pineal region (PTPR) is a rare grade II-III pineal lesion with peculiar histological and immunohistochemical features. These tumors mostly occur in adults, only rarely in children, with 19 cases reported up to now.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a 3-year-old boy who underwent reoperation for a recurrent PTPR (grade II). Gross total resection of the lesion through an occipital interhemispheric approach with the patient in a sitting position was followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Histological examination revealed tumor progression (grade III) and an MIB-1 proliferation index >25%. The patient continues to do well with no evidence of recurrence more than 3 years following surgery. A comprehensive literature review regarding the PTPR, including the current management in children, is reported.
   CONCLUSIONS: PTPRs are extremely rare in children, and immunohistochemistry is needed to differentiate them from other pineal tumors. These tumors show a high rate of recurrence, and a multidisciplinary management approach (microsurgical resection followed by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy) can help achieve a favorable outcome.

ID SPONTANEOUS INTRACRANIAL HYPOTENSION; HEMATOMA; HEADACHE
AB BACKGROUND: Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) often occurs in association with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypovolemia. Many cases with CSDH due to CSF hypovolemia and treated by burr hole surgery have been reported to present with paradoxical deterioration. However, the mechanisms and pathology of deterioration after surgery for CSDH due to CSF hypovolemia remain obscure.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report herein a 62-year-old man with gait disturbance due to subdural fluid collection (SDFC) who underwent burr hole irrigation and additional craniotomy, in which postoperative deterioration resulted from rapidly progressing central herniation with a large amount of air accumulation. Epidural blood patch with saline infusion in the thoracic spine finally resolved central herniation.
   CONCLUSION: SDFC deteriorating after surgery has never been reported. SDFC has communication with CSF differing from mature CSDH composed of closed cavity surrounded by neomembrane. Under situations of CSF hypovolemia due to spinal dural tear, opening the cranium can prompt air replacement in the CSF space, which might represent a substantial risk for central herniation caused by a rapid loss of buoyancy force.

AB BACKGROUND: Arteries that anastomose with the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) can harbor aneurysms.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a patient who suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage as a result from an aneurysm on the left lateral spinal artery (LSA) that anastomosed to the PICA. The aneurysm was treated surgically, and the flow between the LSA and PICA was disrupted. The activated anastomotic network created a new anastomosis between the LSA and PICA, which was seen at 6 months' follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Careful follow-up is warranted in patients who have an activated anastomotic network because they can potentially develop aneurysms on newly created anastomoses.

AB OBJECTIVE: In recent decades endoscopic techniques have been increasingly used in neurosurgery as they may offer a valuable close-up view of the working area through a minimally invasive surgical corridor. Herein, we present an inexpensive and efficient endoscopic surgical model using a borescope, which was used for a "modified pure endoscopic approach" to the pineal region.
   METHODS: A borescope video camera was connected to a 16-inch personal computer monitor. A standard midline suboccipital craniotomy was performed on 2 cadaveric heads in the Concorde position. Then, a "borescopic" supracerebellar infratentorial approach was executed, thus reaching the pineal region, which was exposed through an extensive arachnoid dissection.
   RESULTS: Using the previously described model, we were able to provide excellent exposure of the main neurovascular structures of the pineal region, as shown by the intraoperative videos. In 1 specimen we identified an incidental pineal cyst that was meticulously dissected and removed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed "borescopic" surgical model may represent an inexpensive and efficient alternative to conventional endoscopic techniques and could be used for training purposes, as well as even for clinical procedures, after a proper validation, particularly in economically challenging environments.

TI The Chopsticks Technique for Endoscopic Endonasal Surgery-Improving
   Surgical Efficiency and Reducing the Surgical Footprint
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Endoscopic endonasal surgery; Minimally invasive surgery; Skull base
   surgery
ID TRANSSPHENOIDAL SURGERY; PITUITARY SURGERY; MORBIDITY
AB BACKGROUND: Variations and additions to the endoscopic endonasal exposure have been proposed around a modular strategy. These extensions are often necessary to provide additional working space and reduce conflict between the instruments and the endoscope. Resection of endonasal structures, which affects negatively the sinonasal quality of life, is thus undertaken not only to obtain tumor exposure but also to improve the maneuverability of the instruments.
   OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to achieve the same skull base exposures and tumor resections and limit the surgical footprint on sinonasal structures and patients' quality of life.
   METHODS: Our team developed a surgical technique in which the endoscope and a malleable rotative aspirator are held by the nondominant hand and the other main instrument in the dominant hand. This modification, which we call the chopsticks technique, allows the surgeon to use minimalistic exposures with an improved dynamic perception of the surgical field and reduced conflicts between the instruments. The endonasal structures that are left intact help support the instruments. The same surgical objectives, in terms of exposure and resection, are achieved. We describe our technique and a series of patients operated with this uninarial 3-instruments technique to discuss relevant operative nuances.
   CONCLUSIONS: We propose a technical modification that allows the surgeons to benefit from the advantages of a bimanual technique while still holding the endoscope. In our opinion, this technique may improve dynamic understanding of the anatomy and surgical efficiency and reduce the footprint of the surgery.

   Posterior Cerebral Artery Aneurysm in a Pediatric Patient

AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are rare in the pediatric population and are usually considered difficult to treat with traditional microsurgery owing to their complex morphology. Endovascular techniques have become the standard option for treating IAs in adults. More recently, flow diverters, such as the Pipeline embolization device (PED), are being widely adopted for unruptured IAs, with proven safety and efficacy in adults; however, their use in the pediatric population is not well defined. Here we report a pediatric patient with a ruptured posterior cerebral artery (PCA) aneurysm successfully treated with a PED, and provide a review of the literature on the current status of PED use in this subset of patients.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A previously healthy 4-year old boy presented to the emergency department with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) suggested a ruptured dissecting aneurysm in the right PCA. After discussing treatment options with the child's parents, off-label use of the PED device was chosen. A single PED device was successfully deployed within 24 hours of onset. At a 6-month follow-up, the patient was fully recovered, with a modified Rankin Scale score of 0, and MRA showed complete occlusion of the aneurysm and patency of the parent vessel.
   CONCLUSIONS: Even though the PED has not received Food and Drug Administration approval to treat IAs in children, the literature reports favorable outcomes with this application. Thus, the PED may be a feasible option for treating challenging cases occurring more frequently in the pediatric population. Further studies in pediatric populations are needed to determine whether this technology is a viable and durable option for treating aneurysms in children.

AB BACKGROUND: Formation of a dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) between the inferolateral trunk (ILT) and cavernous sinus (CS) is rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This study presents a case of ILT-CS DAVF. A 64-year-old male patient had exophthalmos of the left eye with redness and swelling. Digital subtraction angiography revealed a connection between the ILT and the CS that formed a high-flow DAVF, which was drained only to the ophthalmic vein and no other parts of the CS. The ILT was chosen as the transarterial path for treatment because it was enlarged. The microcatheter was navigated into the ILT, and 2 coils were then used to occlude the ILT. After occlusion of the ILT, no image of the DAVF indicated that the ILT-CS DAVF was completely cured. The patient's symptoms improved gradually after surgery. At the 6-month follow-up visit, digital subtraction angiography showed no sign of ILT-CS DAVF and the patient's eye symptoms had disappeared.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although ILT-CS DAVF is rare, it can still be seen in clinical practice. Coiling the ILT via a transarterial approach is a good option for treatment.

ID GLUTEAL VARICOSITIES; DECOMPRESSION; NEUROPATHY
AB BACKGROUND: The authors report the case of a 76-year-old woman presenting with leg pain, numbness, and weakness mimicking a lumbosacral radiculopathy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Initial lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated mild root compression, but lumbar decompression afforded only transient symptomatic relief. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbosacral plexus and sciatic nerve revealed a gluteal venous varix compressing the sciatic nerve just distal to the piriformis muscle. Neurolysis and surgical resection of the offending varix resulted in resolution of her symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Variceal compression is a rare cause of extraspinal origin of lower extremity radicular pain. It should be considered if there is lack of correlation between radiologic findings and the clinical picture or if there is a failure of response to treatment of the assumed spinal cause.

DE Aggressive biological behavior; Bcl-2; Cerebral cavernous malformation;
   De novo; Female hormone
ID ANGIOMAS
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are present in up to 0.5% of the general population. Although CCMs have been considered congenital lesions, numerous reports have observed de novo formations in patients with the familial form of CCM and in patients after cranial radiotherapy. Outside of these circumstances, there is scant evidence as to the potential etiologies of CCM.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a 48-year-old woman with a medical history of endometrial hyperplasia concomitant endometrial polyps demonstrating a large de novo CCM, which grew to a large size in a period of 20 months. A previous magnetic resonance imaging scan showed no abnormalities. This CCM exhibited aggressive biological behavior characterized by recurrent overt bleeding and seizure. Histopathologic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of CCM. Here, we discuss the growth mechanisms of these lesions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Given the patient's medical history and imaging findings, we propose that de novo CCMs can arise directly from angiogenic proliferation, secondary to BCL-2 overexpression from underlying causes. We hypothesize that inappropriate secretion of estrogen could have set off a genetic cascade with attendant endothelial proliferation.
   Thus, female hormones may play an important role in influencing the biological behavior of CCMs. The relationship between estrogen and CCM needs further investigation.

AB BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Lesions located lateral to the lower brainstem, such as proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysms, are surgically challenging. We report a case of a patient with a left proximal PICA aneurysm that was successfully clipped via a so-called "extended" suboccipital subtonsillar approach, which allowed us to obtain proper vascular control without removal of the atlas. The anatomy relevant for this approach has been studied.
   METHODS: Three adult cadaveric heads were studied. The relevant neurovascular anatomy related to this approach was exposed. Hence, this technique was applied on the patient herewith reported.
   CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old man with sudden onset of severe headache, nausea, and vomiting was admitted to our hospital. Computed tomography of the brain showed diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, mainly distributed at the level of the perimesencephalic cisterns. Cerebral angiography revealed a 3-mm aneurysm arising at the origin of the left PICA. The aneurysm was considered unsuitable for coil embolization, so it was treated via a "modified" posterolateral suboccipital subtonsillar route. The modification consisted of accomplishing proper proximal vascular control at the extracranial segment of the vertebral artery (V3), without the need of further removal of the posterior portion of the atlas. The patient was discharged neurologically intact.
   CONCLUSIONS: The technique we suggested allowed no unnecessary removal of bone, with no need to drill the occipital condyle or remove the atlas, offered proper proximal vascular control in the early stage of the surgical procedure, and limited the quantity of temporary vascular clips inside the intracranial surgical field.

TI Multiple Extradural Spinal Meningiomas in a Patient with Acquired

DT Review
DE Epidural; Extradural; Meningioma; Spine oncology
ID EN-PLAQUE MENINGIOMA; EPIDURAL MENINGIOMA; VIRUS-INFECTION; CORD
   MENINGIOMA; AIDS PATIENT; FEATURES
AB BACKGROUND: Purely extradural spinal meningiomas are uncommon. Due to their typical location in the neural foramen, they are often mistaken for schwannomas, neurofibromas, and epidural metastases. In addition, comorbid conditions such as immunodeficiency may obscure the diagnosis. We present a case of extradural spinal meningiomas in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This is the first reported case of multiple extradural spinal meningiomas in 2 separate regions of the spine.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 40-year-old male with a past medical history of HIV and hepatitis B infection presented with a 2-month history of progressive back pain radiating to the left flank and thigh. Magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic and lumbar spine with intravenous gadolinium contrast revealed 2 extramedullary masses in the left neural foramina of T6 and L1. The patient underwent laminectomy, which revealed that the 2 lesions were entirely extradural. Both lesions were resected, and the histological diagnosis for both lesions was meningioma, World Health Organization grade I.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with this 40-year-old male with AIDS who presented with radicular symptoms due to multiple purely extradural meningiomas underscores the importance of considering meningioma as a possible diagnosis in patients with tumors of the neural foramina. In addition, a wide differential diagnosis should be made for patients with spinal lesions and history of HIV, including illnesses that are related to immunodeficiency and those that are not.

ID OSTEOPLASTIC ORBITOZYGOMATIC CRANIOTOMY; ETHMOID SINUS; CHILDREN
AB BACKGROUND: Aneurysmal bone cysts are benign bone lesions affecting long bones and vertebrae; only 2%-6% have cranial involvement, and even fewer show sphenoid or intraorbital involvement. Gross total resection is the treatment of choice.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 10-month-old girl presented with unilateral proptosis and no neurologic deficits. Imaging studies revealed an extensive right-sided skull base cystic lesion centered on the sphenoid wing with extension into the orbit anteriorly and the pterygoid plates inferiorly. She underwent a modified osteoplastic orbitozygomatic craniotomy for resection of the extradural tumor. Postoperative imaging showed successful decompression of the intraorbital contents with no residual tumor. She remained neurologically intact and was discharged on postoperative day 2. Histologic examination revealed the lesion to be consistent with an aneurysmal bone cyst. At 3-month follow-up, her proptosis had resolved, neurologic examination was nonfocal, and there was no radiographic evidence of recurrence.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the youngest patient reported to have a spheno-orbital aneurysmal bone cyst. Such lesions in this age group present practical management challenges. By using a modified osteoplastic orbitozygomatic craniotomy, we achieved a gross total resection with minimal brain retraction, avoided the need for plating and suturing at the orbital rim, maintained a vascularized bone flap that is less susceptible to infection, and maintained normal temporalis muscle anatomy with excellent cosmetic results.

   Endovascular; Retrieval; Stentriever

   OCCLUSIONS; TRIAL; TREVO; SWIFT
AB BACKGROUND: Displacement of endovascular coils during endovascular embolization of an intracranial aneurysm is a potentially life-threatening complication. Several methods for coil retrieval have been described, including the use of microsnares and microforceps retrieval devices. With the recent surge of stentriever implementation in the treatment of ischemic stroke, some operators are now using such devices in the retrieval of migrated coils. We present a case of a balloon-assisted coil embolization of a communicating segment internal carotid artery aneurysm, complicated by coil migration far distally into the middle cerebral artery, which was retrieved successfully with a stentriever. To the best of our knowledge, this is the furthest migration of a coil to be successfully retrieved with a stentriever. We review conservative and invasive management of displaced coils and the technical advantages of stentrievers over retrieval devices.
   METHODS: The patient's medical records were retrospectively reviewed, including clinical and radiographic information. This study received institutional review board approval.
   RESULTS: The patient was treated with balloon-assisted coil embolization of the internal carotid artery aneurysm. The migrated coil was retrieved successfully using a novel application of a stentriever.
   CONCLUSIONS: In certain situations, a stentriever does not mandate complete ensnaring of the target to be retrieved and thus need not always be deployed distal to a migrated coil mass to be successful. Due to the mechanical advantage of strut-engagement, stentrievers can afford to be positioned in relatively suboptimal positions, and this is especially useful in cases involving tortuous and small distal vessels (< 2 mm diameter).

TI From Conversation to Transformation: Mens' Perspective on Strange
   Nuances of Neurosurgical Practice for Women in India
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Comparison; Conversation; Gynecology; India; Neurosurgery; Women
AB BACKGROUND: In India, men outnumber women in neurosurgery by a wide margin. At the graduation party of our woman colleague, we recalled the experiences of the past few years. It led to a transforming experience for the authors, who have hitherto only held the "mens' perspective."
   METHODS: Societal pressures of marriage, profession, family, and culture on women in India emerge readily in this conversational piece. A comparison with "obstetrics and gynecology" in which women dominate is drawn to better describe the idiosyncrasies of Indian society. The meaning of discrimination and equality is examined in terms of neurosurgical training for women.
   RESULTS: At present, the price of becoming a doctor in India is the youth of the kid and uncertainties in the career because of gruesome competition at each level, without any incentives.
   CONCLUSIONS: Conversation itself is one of the greatest forces for changing the situation and how this conversation can be taken forward to transform a "culture of discrimination" to a "culture of acceptance."

AB BACKGROUND: Pseudarthrosis and rod fracture (RF) remain significant concerns after fusion for adult spinal deformity (ASD). Although a radiographic system of fusion grade has been proposed, the correlation between fusion grade and health-related quality of life measures (HRQoL) is not known.
   METHODS: In a retrospective review of a prospectively collected clinical database, patients that underwent >= 5-level posterior instrumented arthrodesis for ASD were evaluated. Fusion grade was determined on plain films using the Lenke criteria. Patients were grouped as 1) complete fusion (grade I or II at all levels), 2) incomplete fusion (grade 3 or 4 at any level), 3) rod fracture without revision (RF), and 4) rod fracture with revision (RFR). Outcome measures were the Oswestry Disability Index, Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey Physical and Mental Component Summaries, Scoliosis Research Society-22r total, and Lumbar Stiffness and Disability Index.
   RESULTS: There were 205 (85%) patients who achieved the minimum 2-year follow-up and were included. Complete fusion was achieved in 115 patients (56.1%), 55% patients (26.8%) had incomplete fusion, and 35% patients (17.1%) had RF. Of the 35 patients with RF, 19 (17.1%; 19/205) underwent revision while 16 (7.8%; 16/205) had RF without revision. HRQoL measures were significantly worse in the RFR group, whereas no significant differences were found between groups 1, 2, and 3.
   CONCLUSIONS: Radiographic fusion grade after ASD surgery did not significantly impact HRQoL in the absence of RF. RFR was associated with significantly worse clinical outcomes. Fusion grade may be less predictive of clinical outcomes than the occurrence of RF.

AB OBJECTIVE: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive, high-resolution imaging technique that was suggested to be a powerful biomarker of neurodegeneration. The objective of our study is to assess the pattern of retinal OCT changes in patients with visual pathway tumors.
   METHODS: A prospective clinical study was conducted and patients with single cerebral tumors with potential of compression on the visual pathway were included. Patients with multiple and/or metastatic tumors were excluded. Each patient underwent a neurosurgical and ophthalmologic evaluation, cranial-cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, and ocular OCT in both eyes. The OCT parameters included circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (average and sector thickness) and retinal thickness in the macular area (average and sector thickness).
   RESULTS: Fifty patients were investigated clinically and by magnetic resonance imaging, and 18 patients were excluded. Thirty-two patients were eligible for the study and completed the retinal OCT. Eighteen patients had tumors with compressive potential on the optic chiasm, 11 patients had tumors close to the optic radiations, and 3 patients had tumors in the occipital lobe. A specific pattern of OCT changes was found for each site. Regional parameters of both optic nerve and macula were altered.
   CONCLUSIONS: Retinal OCT is a promising tool for the in vivo assessment of the neurodegeneration pattern in patients with intracranial tumors. The evaluation of single intracranial tumors with compressive potential on the visual pathway is a good candidate for the study of neurodegeneration.

ID CANCER
AB BACKGROUND: Intradural extramedullary (IDEM) spinal cord tumors account for two-thirds of all intraspinal neoplasms. Surgery for IDEM tumors carries risks for many different complications, which to date have been poorly described and quantified. In this study, we better characterize risk factors and complications for IDEM tumors, stratifying patients by spinal cord level and malignancy.
   METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database was queried to determine 30-day outcomes following surgery for IDEM tumors between 2005 and 2016. Patients with cervical, thoracic, and lumbar tumors were compared in terms of demographics, comorbidities, and postoperative complications. A similar analysis was performed comparing patients with benign and malignant tumors.
   RESULTS: A total of 991 patients with IDEM tumors were identified in the cohort. The majority of tumors were thoracic (44.3%), followed by lumbar (35.4%) and cervical (20.3%). Only 6.3% of patients were readmitted within 30 days, 4.2% returned to the operating room, and 1.0% died. Significant associations were noted between spinal cord level and patient sex, age, functional status, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, prevalence of diabetes and hypertension, and risk of developing pneumonia. Benign and malignant tumors differed by patient sex, baseline ASA class, risk of return to the operating room, mortality, and likelihood of transfusion.
   CONCLUSIONS: IDEM tumors are common and carry surgical risks, with different complication profiles for tumors at different spinal levels and degrees of malignancy. With definitive risk factors and outcomes, the ACSNSQIP cohort provides a snapshot of national neurosurgery trends and outcomes in contemporary IDEM surgery.

ID I MALFORMATION; JUNCTION
AB BACKGROUND: For more than a century, odontoid process prolapse, which compresses cranial base structures, has been the hallmark of basilar invagination (BI). The angulation of the whole skull toward the cervical spine may be considered to contribute to BI and odontoid prolapse. The objective of this study was to evaluate the craniocervical angular craniometry of patients with BI compared with patients with Chiari malformation (CM) and normal subjects.
   METHODS: Angular craniocervical relationships among midline magnetic resonance imaging scans from patients with BI, patients with CM, and normal subjects were evaluated and compared. Angles were measured by Meazure 2.0 software from digitalized images.
   RESULTS: Using data from 121 images, 42 patients with BI (14 type I BI, 28 type II BI), 47 patientswith CM, and 32 control subjects were evaluated. The BI group had a more acute kyphotic angle than the CM group (P < 0.01) and control group. The kyphosis difference was 17.57 +/- 2.3 degrees (P < 0.01) between the BI and CM groups and 21.19 +/- 2.3 degrees (P < 0.01) between the BI and control groups. Basal angles were significantly larger in the BI group compared with the other 2 groups. A strong correlation was found with kyphosis and CLV and the clivuscanal angle and cervical lordosis angle (P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Craniocervical kyphosis in patients with BI was approximately 20 degrees greater than in normal subjects and patients with CM. Craniocervical kyphosis should be considered a pathophysiologic condition in BI.

AB BACKGROUND: Postoperative epidural adhesion is a frequent cause of failed back surgery syndrome, manifesting with back and leg pain or neurologic deficits. Development of preventive measures for epidural adhesion after laminectomy is critical to improve outcomes of lumbar surgery. We hypothesized that positive effects of topical application of Contractubex (CTX) gel and benzothiazole (BT) individually and in combination could aid in preventing epidural fibrosis in a rat laminectomy model.
   METHODS: Rats were randomly assigned to 2 control and 5 experimental groups (n = 8 for each group). The control( L) group received no surgery, whereas the control(D) group underwent laminectomy without any drug administration. In experimental groups, study agents applied to dura mater after laminectomy were 100mgCTX, 2.5%BT, 5%BT; 100mgCTXplus2.5%BT, and 100mgCTXplus5%BT. Laminectomy was performed at the L3 level for all rats. The extent of epidural fibrosis was assessed 4 weeks later macroscopically and histopathologically. Hepatic and renal toxicity of study drugs was assessed histopathologically.
   RESULTS: Topical CTX and BT individually and in combination reduced epidural fibrosis after laminectomy in rats. Although a meaningful decrease of epidural fibrosis with individual application of CTX and BT (2.5% or 5%) was obtained (P < 0.05), the effect of their combination was more pronounced without meaningful hepatic and renal toxicity (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Combined use of topical CTX and BT could be a potential therapy for epidural fibrosis. Further research with this agents for the prevention of epidural fibrosis is warranted.

AB OBJECTIVE: Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a common spinal problem, with reoperation rates of 6%-24%. Although different surgical techniques are used for treatment, there is still debate regarding whether fusion techniques can reduce the reoperation rate in patients with LDH.
   METHODS: This retrospective study used a 5-year nationwide database to analyze reoperation rates in Taiwan. Patient age groups (>= 20 and <90 years) treated by index surgery and reoperation for LDH were identified. Four surgical procedures were included in the analysis: discectomy (DC), anterior lumbar fusion with DC (FA + DC), posterior lumbar fusion (FP), and posterior lumbar fusion with DC (FP + DC).
   RESULTS: There were 1743 index surgeries between 2008 and 2012, with 184 (10.56%) reoperations. Index surgery DC had the highest reoperation rate (n = 121, 20%). The reoperation risk was significantly lower for patients undergoing fusion procedures (FA + DC vs. DC [hazard ratio (HR), 0.24; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.12-0.47; P < 0.01], FP versus DC [HR, 0.17; 95% C, 0.09-0.33; P < 0.01], FP + DC versus DC [HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.22-0.44; P < 0.01]). Fusion procedures had significantly higher treatment costs compared with DC (FA + DC vs. FP vs. FP + DC vs. DC: 5851.74 +/- 4808.94 vs. 5116.88 +/- 3428.97 vs. 4782.16 +/- 2902.19 vs. 3846.79 +/- 3584.45 U.S. dollars/patient, respectively; P < 0.0001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Among surgical procedures for LDH, fusion techniques are related to lower reoperation rates compared with discectomy, but at the expense of higher medical costs.

   SENTENCE; MANAGEMENT
AB OBJECTIVE: To assess computed tomography scans to evaluate the extent of reduction of fracture displacement and fracture gap after anterior odontoid screw fixation using the Herbert screw.
   METHODS: Thirty-seven odontoid fractures were reduced and treated by anterior odontoid screw fixation with the Herbert screw. Therewere 37 patients whose age ranged from 20 to 79 years. Three-dimensional computed tomography scans were obtained for all patients to assess the screw position, the presence of the penetration of superior cortex of dens, the extent of reduction of fracture displacement, and fracture gap.
   RESULTS: Mean fracture displacement was 2.6 +/- 3.2 mm before surgery; after the operation this value was 1.0 +/- 1.5 mm. The difference in fracture gap between the preoperative and the postoperative state was -0.1 +/- 1.1 mm, which was not statistically significant (P = 0.667).
   We achieved cortical purchase in only 16 of 37 patients (43.2%); cortical purchase was not obtained in 21 patients (56.7%) due to the fear of the risk of the damage of neural and vascular structures. Of these 21 patients who had no penetration of the superior cortex of dens, widening of the fracture gap occurred in 12 patients (57%), no change in 6 patients (29%), and there was shortening in 3 patients (14%). However, of the 16 patients with penetration of apical dens tip, we achieved significant reduction of fracture gap (P = 0.002).
   CONCLUSIONS: To maximize reduction of fracture gap using the Herbert screw, it is essential to penetrate the apical dens tip.

TI Rod Fracture After Apparently Solid Radiographic Fusion in Adult Spinal
   Deformity Patients
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Adult spinal deformity; ASD; Fusion; Pseudarthrosis; Rod Fracture
ID RISK-FACTORS; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Rod fracture occurs with delayed fusion or pseudarthrosis after adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery. Rod fracture after apparent radiographic fusion has not been previously investigated.
   METHODS: Patients with ASD in a multicenter database were assessed for radiographic fusion by a committee of 3 spinal deformity surgeons. Fusions were rated as bilaterally fused (A), unilaterally fused (B), partially fused (C), or not fused (D). Patients with grade A or B fusion and 2-year follow-up were included. Patients with radiographic fusion were evaluated for subsequent rod fracture. Adjusted analyses were conducted with multiple logistic regression, using backwards-variable selection to a threshold of P < 0.2, to assess for associated factors.
   RESULTS: Of 402 patients with radiographically apparent solid fusion, 9.5% (38) subsequently suffered a broken rod. On multivariate analysis, greater rates of rod fracture were seen among patients of age group 60-69 years (vs. 18-49), body mass index 30-34 and 35+ (vs. < 25), stainless-steel rods (vs. titanium), patients with rods <= 5.5 mm (vs. 6.35 mm), and patients with Charlson score 0 (vs. 3+). Of the 38 patients with rod fractures, 18 (47.4%) presented with worsened pain, and 8 (21.1%) required revision at minimum 2-year follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Rod fracture occurred in 9.5% of patients with apparently solid radiographic fusion after ASD surgery. Advanced age, obesity, small diameter rods (5.5 mm), osteotomy, and lower comorbidity burden were significantly associated with rod fracture. Nearly one-half of these patients noted worsening pain, and 21.1% required revision surgery. Instrumentation failure may occur and may be symptomatic even in the setting of apparent fusion on plain radiographs.

AB BACKGROUND: As survival after treatment for symptomatic spinal metastases increases, the incidence of local tumor recurrence also may increase. However, data regarding incidence and timing of recurrence or duration of survival after second surgeries are not readily available and may help to inform clinicians when to perform second surgeries.
   OBJECTIVE: To identify features associated with loss of local control (LLC) at a previously treated or new spinal level.
   METHODS: Clinical and surgical data were collected from a prospective cohort of 1421 patients who had surgery for symptomatic spinal metastases. Patients undergoing repeat spinal surgery for symptomatic LLC at the same or a different level were identified and analyzed.
   RESULTS: In total, 3.0% patients underwent repeat surgery for symptomatic LLC after a median interval of 184 days from the first surgery; median survival was 6.1 months after second surgery. Factors associated with second surgery for LLC were the primary tumor type, number of spinal levels, Tomita staging, Tokuhashi and Karnofsky scores, anterior surgical approach, more aggressive surgical resection, and postoperative radiotherapy. In total, 1.5% patients were admitted for surgery for a different spinal level than the index operation after median 338 days from the first operation.
   CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood for repeat surgery due to LLC cannot be accurately predicted at the time of initial presentation. Factors associated with second surgery for LLC relate to less aggressive tumor biology and better survival. Most patients had a reasonable duration of survival after second surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: Craniovertebral junction diseases, although considered rare, are common in northern parts of India. This study was conducted to evaluate the clinico-radiologic and surgical outcome of patients with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Our study also compared bony fusion among various techniques of posterior fusion.
   METHODS: This retrospective study was performed with 38 patients who met the inclusion criteria for analysis. These patients were contacted by telephone and letters, and their clinical examination and radiologic investigations were performed at a follow-up visit. The preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up clinical evaluations of the patients were done using the Nurick grading system.
   RESULTS: The age range was 4-60 years with an average of 20.5 years. There were 31 male and 7 female patients, with a male: female ratio of 4.43:1. There were 13 cases of fixed atlantoaxial dislocation (AAD), 17 cases of mobile AAD, 6 cases of traumatic AAD, and 2 cases of postinfective AAD. The majority of these patients (n = 29; 76.31%) had neck pain and cerebellovestibular disturbances (n = 27; 71.1%). Sphincter disturbances were observed in 9 patients. An increase in craniovertebral angle was observed in postoperative period in all patients. Initially, 84% of the patients had a poor Nurick grade; this was reduced to 28% after the surgical intervention. One hundred percent bony fusion was attained in patients who underwent rigid fixation technique, and 80% was attained using a semirigid fixation technique.
   CONCLUSIONS: The key to successful management of craniovertebral junction disease is individualized selection of judicious surgical intervention from various available techniques.

ID ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; ONYX EMBOLIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Although the ipsilateral inferior petrosal sinus (IPS) is preferred for treatment of cavernous sinus dural arteriovenous fistulas (CS-dAVFs), this method is problematic if ipsilateral IPS is occluded. We describe our experience in treating CS-dAVFs with ipsilateral IPS occlusion via the ascending pharyngeal artery (APA).
   METHODS: Between January 2013 and June 2017, of 36 CS-dAVFs, 23 with ipsilateral IPS occlusion were identified. Clinical charts, procedural data, angiographic results, and follow-up data were retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS: Of 23 CS-dAVFs, 16 displayed a single or dominant feeding APA on cerebral angiography, of which 13 were treated via the APA initially. Fistulas were occluded successfully through the neuromeningeal trunk of the APA in 7 cases and through the superior pharyngeal branch of the APA in 3 cases. Glue leakage occurred in 2 cases via the superior pharyngeal branch of the APA, and superior pharyngeal branch rupture occurred during superselection of the microguidewire in 1 patient, who was treated by opening the occluded ipsilateral IPS. During the follow-up period, 12 of 13 patients had complete occlusion, and no cranial nerve palsy occurred.
   CONCLUSIONS: CS-dAVF with ipsilateral IPS occlusion can be treated via various methods. Embolization through the APA as an initial access is a reasonable choice.

   COMPRESSION; MRI; SURGERY; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND: Although recent work has focused on characterizing quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers that may predict outcome among patients with cervical degenerative conditions, little is known about their reliability. Measurement and reporting of these markers is time-consuming and nonstandardized, preventing routine use in clinical care.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed cervical MRI among subjects prospectively enrolled in a health outcomes study of elective surgery for degenerative cervical spine conditions. Two radiologists independently reviewed MRI for presence or absence and length of cord signal change, level of worst cord compression, axial anteroposterior (AP) and lateral spinal cord diameter, midsagittal AP diameter, and kyphosis. Interobserver reliability was compared using kappa and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).
   RESULTS: Inclusion criteria were met by 209 patients who had MRI available for review. Most patients were female (58%) and middle-aged (mean age 51 years), and 54% had a diagnosis of myelopathy. Reliability was fair for cord signal change on T1 (k = 0.33) and good on T2 (k = 0.74) images. Among patients with T2 change (n = 22), reliability for signal change length was good (ICC = 0.67). For level of worst compression, reliability was good (k = 0.79). For AP cord diameter, reliability was very good (ICC = 0.82; T2/midsagittal) and good (ICC = 0.66; T2/axial). Reliability was moderate for lateral cord diameter (ICC = 0.55; T2/axial) and good for kyphosis (k = 0.76).
   CONCLUSIONS: Good and very good reliability observed in measuring T2-weighted spinal cord signal change, level of worst compression, AP cord diameter, and kyphosis support use of these markers in standardized reporting, which could be incorporated into routine clinical use.

AB BACKGROUND: Duraplasty is a technique successfully used to treat Chiari malformation type I (CM-I). This study describes the timely manner of clinical outcomes and the postoperative course after craniectomy and duraplasty for the treatment of symptomatic CM-I in children.
   METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed in 105 consecutive children who underwent surgical decompression of symptomatic CM-I with dural opening by a single surgeon between 1999 and 2015.
   RESULTS: In 16 of 28 children (57%) with typical Valsalva-related/tussive and mixed headaches, the symptoms resolved before discharge; by 6 months, all children were headache-free. Two of 28 children (7%) had recurrent headaches 9 months after surgery. Among the 78 children with syrinx, syrinx resolved or decreased in 68 (87%), recurred in 8 (10%), and was stable in 2 children (3%). Syrinx was resolved or decreased by 3 months in 51 children (65%) and by 6 months in 62 children (79%). Complications included aseptic meningitis requiring reoperation in 3 children (3%) and infection in one child (1%). Twelve children underwent reoperation, none within the first 30 days. No child had a major morbidity or mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS: In carefully selected children with CM-I, a high success rate can be achieved with suboccipital decompression and duraplasty. Valsalva-related/tussive headaches resolved by the time of discharge from the hospital in the majority of children, and syrinx resolved or decreased in two-thirds of the children by 3 months. By 6 months, headaches were resolved in all cases, and syrinx was resolved or decreased in 79% of cases.

AB OBJECTIVE: Long-term effectiveness of selective ventralis intermedius nucleus (VIM) eventralis oralis nucleus (VO) thalamotomy with depth microrecording for the treatment of focal dystonia was evaluated. The optimal thalamic areas for controlling focal dystonia were studied based on the electrophysiologic and anatomic data.
   METHODS: Stereotactic selective VIM-VO thalamotomy with depth microrecording was carried out in 8 patients with focal arm and hand dystonia and in 1 patient with cervical dystonia. Electrophysiologic data on the lateral part of thalamic VIM were studied in patients with focal dystonia. A very small and narrow therapeutic lesion was formed in the shape of a square on the sagittal plane and of an I, rotated V, Y, or inverse Y on the axial plane in the VIM-VO, which covered the kinesthetic response area topographically related to focal dystonia. Patients with arm and hand dystonia were followed up for 4.7 +/- 3.0 years and 1 patient with cervical dystonia was followed up for 18.2 years.
   RESULTS: Marked improvement of focal dystonia was shown by functional assessment using the Unified Dystonia Rating Scale. Transient dysarthria was recognized in 1 patient. The sequence of body localization of kinesthetic response in the VIM was clearly shown in patients with focal dystonia. Decreases in the amplitude and amplitude ratio of electromyography on the forearm muscles were markedly significant after VIM thalamotomy, but insignificant after VO thalamotomy immediately after VIM thalamotomy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Marked reduction of electromyographic tonic discharges of focal dystonia was shown after VIM lesioning. Selective VIM-VO thalamotomy showed good and long-term stable effects for focal dystonia.

   COMPRESSION; NERVE
AB BACKGROUND: Trigeminal neuralgia (TGN) is a debilitating disorder, and in patients for whom medical management is not sufficient, there are several therapeutic options. Microvascular decompression (MVD) for TGN has been shown to be highly effective; however, pain does recur after MVD in some patients. Therapeutic options for recurrent TGN are the same as those for primary TGN, including re-exploration of MVD (re-MVD). In this study we review our practice of re-MVD, comparing it with alternative options and assessing its safety and efficacy.
   METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of patients undergoing re-MVD between 2007 and 2016.
   RESULTS: Thirty-two patients underwent re-MVD, all with a Barrow Neurosurgical Institute Pain Index (BNPI) of IV or V. Postoperatively, 87% of patients reported an improvement in their BNPI to III or better, with 50% being BNPI 1 or 2. Eleven patients without distortion or vascular conflict at the time of re-exploration underwent intra-operative neurolysis, and 90% reported improvement in their BNPI. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a median pain-free period of 36 months after re-MVD. There were no significant complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Re-MVD is a safe and effective method of treating recurrent TGN. Intraoperative neurolysis is an important tool in re-exploration and should be considered when there is no ongoing compression or distortion of the trigeminal nerve.

   Cerebellar Artery Aneurysm: A Single-Center 10 Years' Experience
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Posterior inferior cerebellar artery; Subarachnoid hemorrhage
ID ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; STRATEGIES; SERIES
AB OBJECTIVE: To report a single-center experience with endovascular treatment of ruptured proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysms.
   METHODS: Between January 2007 and December 2016, among 1403 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, 15 with ruptured proximal PICA aneurysms underwent endovascular embolization at our institution. Aneurysmal obliteration with a single microcatheter was performed in 9 patients. Additional microcatheter or stent-assisted coil embolization was performed in 4 patients and parent artery occlusion in 2 patients.
   RESULTS: Immediate angiographic results showed 10 complete occlusions (66.7%, 10/15). Five patients showed incomplete occlusion (remnant neck in 4 patients, remnant aneurysm in 1). Of those, 2 patients experienced recurrence and required conversion to microsurgical clipping. The remaining 2 patients remained in relatively stable condition. Procedure-related complications occurred in 3 patients (20%, with thromboembolic complications in 2 patients and intraprocedural rupture in 1). Clinical outcome was excellent: Glasgow Outcome Score 4 or 5 in 12 of 15 patients (80%). There was no rebleeding during follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ruptured proximal PICA aneurysms may be effectively treated with endovascular coil embolization. A variety of coil embolization techniques are required to obliterate an aneurysm without parent artery occlusion. Given that recurrence is possible, follow-up is required. Surgical clipping can be performed for recurrence with a relatively low risk of complications, because the aneurysm is unruptured. Coil embolization of a proximal PICA aneurysm in the acute phase can be a good treatment modality with good patient outcomes.

   RISK; BRAIN; THROMBOPROPHYLAXIS
AB BACKGROUND: While prophylaxis with intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) can effectively prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) during the neurocritical care of patients with severe aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), the risk for intracranial bleeding complications might increase. Owing to this therapeutic dilemma, the UFH administration regimen in this critical patient population remains highly controversial.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with severe aSAH (Fisher grade 3-4) receiving either low-dose (activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT] <40 seconds) or therapeutic range (aPTT 50-60 seconds) UFH during intensive care unit (ICU) treatment after complete surgical/endovascular aneurysm occlusion. The primary outcome was the rate of bleeding/VTE complications and the investigation of potential risk factors.
   RESULTS: This study series comprised 410 patients with aneurysmal SAH (aSAH), with a mean age of 54.7 +/- 12.6 years, a male: female ratio of 1:2.2, and aSAH-associated intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in 33.2%. After complete aneurysm occlusion, 112 patients (27.3%) received therapeutic dose UFH and 298 patients (72.7%) received low-dose UFH. VTE events occurred in 5.4% of the low-dose UFH cohort and in 6.3% of the therapeutic dose UFH cohort, with no significant differences in the rate and severity of VTE events. However, an increase in initial SAH-associated ICH was significantly (P = 0.007) more frequent in the therapeutic dose cohort (18.8% vs. 3.4%). Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) was the sole risk factor for VTE (P < 0.001), and both an aPTT >= 50 seconds under UFH administration (P = 0.007) and the initial presence of SAH-associated ICH (P = 0.035) were significant risk factors for intracranial bleeding complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Even in high-risk neurocritical patients with severe SAH and prolonged ICU treatment, low-dose UFH-administration for VTE prophylaxis is equally effective as therapeutic UFH administration and carries a lower risk of bleeding complications.

AB OBJECTIVE: To present a minimally invasive surgical technique using cortical bone trajectory pedicle screws (cortical screws [CS]) for adjacent segment pathology (ASP) after lumbar fusion surgery, and to thoroughly compare postoperative outcomes of surgical techniques with either a CS or conventional pedicle screws (PS) for ASP at a 1-year follow-up.
   METHODS: Among 59 patients who underwent surgical treatment for proximal ASP after lumbar fusion surgery, 53 patients who met the study criteria (group A, 31 patients with conventional technique using PS; group B, 22 patients with minimally invasive technique using CS) were enrolled in the study. The primary outcome measure was the fusion rate at 1 year after surgery, and secondary outcome measures included patient satisfaction, clinical outcomes, radiologic outcomes, and surgical outcomes and complications.
   RESULTS: Fusion at 1 year postsurgery was achieved by 90% of the patients in group A with PS and 91% of those in group B with CS (P > 0.99). Patient satisfaction at 1 month postsurgery (P = 0.03) and pain intensity within 1 month postsurgery (P = 0.04) were significantly better in group B compared with group A. Regarding surgical outcomes, blood loss was significantly less, operation time and length of hospital stay were significantly shorter, and the incision was significantly shorter n group B than in group A. Other clinical parameters and outcomes were similar in the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that a minimally invasive surgical technique using CS for ASP can be a viable alternative to a conventional surgical technique using PS.

AB BACKGROUND: Current surgical therapies for spontaneous intracerebellar hemorrhage (SCH) include suboccipital craniotomy (SC), stereotactic aspiration and thrombolysis (SAT), and endoscopic surgery (ES). Evidence comparing the therapeutic effects of these 3 methods is scarce. The safety and efficacy of SC, SAT, and ES for SCH are still uncertain.
   METHODS: 75 patients with SCH who received SC, SAT, or ES were reviewed retrospectively. Baseline parameters before the operation, evacuation rate, perihematoma edema, postoperative complications, and cumulative case fatalities were collected. Also, 12 months after ictus, the long-term functional outcomes in patients with regard to fourth ventricle compression and age were judged, respectively, by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).
   RESULTS: The SAT was less effective in evacuating hematoma than were SC and ES. The perihematoma edema on postoperative day 7 and surgical complications were highest in the SC group. The functional outcome represented by mRS was better in the SAT group than in the SC and ES groups for patients with fourth ventricle compression grade 1. For patients with fourth ventricle compression grades 2 and 3, the ES group achieved the best functional outcome. Patients older than 60 years benefited less from SC than from ES and SAT.
   CONCLUSIONS: SAT may be suitable for SCH patients with fourth ventricle compression grade 1, and ES may be suitable for SCH patients with fourth ventricle compression grades 2 and 3. Aged patients benefit less from SC than from SAT and ES.

AB ( BACKGROUND: Intraoperative resection or occlusion control is indispensable in the surgery of vascular anomalies. This can be conducted using local vascular imaging modalities or angiographic techniques. This series was performed to assess whether cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and dural arteriovenous fistulae (dAVFs) can be detected in a sufficient quality by intraoperative 3-dimensional (3D) fluoroscopy with intravenous contrast application.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five patients were included in the analysis (2 AVMs, 3 dAVFs). All patients had preoperative digital subtraction angiography. The head was fixed in a carbon MAYFIELD clamp. After a 3D rotational fluoroscopy scan without contrast agent, a second scan with 50 mL of iodine contrast agent was performed. The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine data of both scans were subtracted and reconstructed using the OsiriX imaging software. In 2 patients with dAVF, occlusion control was performed after obliteration of the fistula.
   RESULTS: In the 2 patients with cerebral AVM, 3D fluoroscopy with intravenous contrast administration resulted in good image quality. Preoperative embolization with Onyx produces significant artifacts that can be largely removed by simple digital subtraction techniques. In dural AVF, occlusion control was well feasible after obliteration of the draining vein at its dural origin.
   CONCLUSIONS: This technique quickly supplies intraoperative images of adequate quality to locate cerebral AVM and dAVF. However, it does not produce dynamic images. Thus, early draining veins cannot be located unless anatomically identified based on the preoperative DSA. In this case, it can be used for intraoperative obliteration control.

AB BACKGROUND: Surgical access to the temporal lobe is complex with many eloquent white fiber tracts, requiring careful preoperative surgical planning. Many microsurgical approaches to the temporal lobes are described, each with their own disadvantages. The adoption of the endoscope in neurosurgery has increased the options available when treating these difficult access tumors. We present our experience of a novel, minimally invasive, endoscopic approach to resect temporal lobe tumors.
   METHODS: All patients undergoing endoscopic temporal lobe tumor resection between December 1, 2011 and December 1, 2017, with a single surgeon, were included. Tumors were resected through a minicraniotomy using a high-definition rigid endoscope with a 0-and 30-degree viewing angle. Bimanual resection was performed using standard microsurgical technique.
   RESULTS: There were 45 patients (22 men and 23 women) with a mean age of 53 years. There were 23 (51%) glioblastoma multiforme, 11 (24%) metastases, 7 (16%) astrocytoma, 3 (7%) anaplastic astrocytoma, and 1 (2%) World Health Organization grade I glioneuronal tumor. In 82.2% of cases (37/45), >95% resection was achieved and 42.2% (19/45) of patients achieving gross total resection.
   CONCLUSIONS: The endoscope has a role in temporal lobe intraparenchymal tumor surgery, especially in 3 illustrative scenarios: 1) medial temporal, parahippocampal-gyrus low-grade nonenhancing gliomas, 2) subcortical high-grade glioma and metastases medial to the sagittal stratum, and 3) recurrent gliomas with cystic resection cavity. The endoscope offers a safe and useful adjunct to the surgeons' armamentarium in brain tumor surgery. A minimally invasive approach also reduces surgical morbidity and length of stay.

AB BACKGROUND: Regardless of acceptable surgical results of middle cerebral artery aneurysms (MCAs), MCA territory infarction (MCATI) remains a major obstacle to achieving a good outcome. We investigated the MCATI in patients with surgically treated MCA aneurysms.
   METHODS: The data of 286 consecutive patients with 322 MCA aneurysms were evaluated retrospectively. The aneurysm location was classified as early frontal cortical branch (EFCB), early temporal cortical branch (ETCB), bifurcation or trifurcation (M1-2), and distal aneurysms on the insular, opercular, or cortical segments of the MCA (distal MCA). Neurologic worsening was defined as an increase in 1 or more modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores.
   RESULTS: Multivariate analysis identified EFCB location as the sole risk factor for MCATI (odds ratio [OR], 3.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-12; P = 0.021) and MCATI (OR, 18; 95% CI, 2.8-117; P = 0.002) and a larger size ratio (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8; P = 0.019) were related to 12-month neurologic worsening (n = 6; 1.9%). During follow-up (median, 885 days; interquartile range, 485-1229 days), posttreatment rupture and aneurysm recurrence were not observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, compared with M1-2 aneurysms, MCATIs were observed more frequently in EFCB aneurysms, and the presence of MCATI and a larger size ratio were related to 12-month neurologic worsening in patients with surgically treated MCA aneurysms.

AB BACKGROUND: The cognitive impairments after treatment of ruptured aneurysms have often been underestimated. This study sought to assess their prevalence and analyze various associated factors.
   METHODS: Patients who were operated on for ruptured anterior circulation aneurysms and discharged with a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 4-5 were studied at 3 months for various cognitive impairments. Continuous scales of memory (recent, remote, verbal, visual, and overall memory), verbal fluency (phonemic and category fluency), and others were studied in relation to various factors. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using SPSS version 21.
   RESULTS: A total of 87 patients were included in our study. Phonemic fluency was the most affected, noted in 66% of patients. Although 56% had some memory-related impairments, 13 (15%) and 6 (7%) had moderate and severe deficits in recent memory and 19 (22%) and 12 (14%) had moderate and severe deficits in remote memory, respectively. Patients operated on for anterior cerebral artery (ACA) aneurysms had significantly greater impairments in recent (34% vs. 8%) and remote memory (43% vs. 28%) compared with the rest, both in univariate (P = 0.01 and 0.002, respectively) and multivariate analyses (P = 0.01 and 0.03, respectively). ACA-related aneurysms also had significantly greater independent impairments in phonemic fluency (P = 0.04), compared with others. The clinical grade had a significant independent impact only on remote memory (P = 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairments are frequent after treatment of ruptured anterior circulation aneurysms. Impairments in recent memory, remote memory, and phonemic fluency are significantly greater after treatment of ACA-related aneurysms, compared with others, independent of other factors.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate prevalence, incidence, morbidity, and mortality rates of cervical ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) using data from a 12-year national cohort of 1,025,340 Korean people.
   METHODS: A nested case-control cohort study was performed from 2002 to 2013 using the insurance claims database provided by the National Health Insurance Service. We examined prevalence and incidence of cervical OPLL. Age-and sex-matched control subjects were randomly extracted, with 10 times the number of OPLL cases. Differences in sex, comorbidity, and relative survival rate compared with control subjects were assessed.
   RESULTS: Cumulative prevalence was 20,960 per 1,025,340 people for 12 years. Annual incidence was approximately 199-371 per 1 million people. Overall crude mortality rate was 7.64%. Relative survival rate of OPLL cases was not significantly different from control cases. Diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease, except renal disease, correlated significantly with OPLL compared with control cases (P < 0.001). Additionally, between dead and surviving patients among OPLL cases, all comorbidities correlated more significantly with death (P < 0.001). Furthermore, between surgery and nonsurgery cases of OPLL, diabetes, hypertension, and renal disease (P < 0.05) were significantly associated with surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Annual incidence of OPLL was 199-371 per 1,025,340 people for 10 years. Diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease, except renal disease, correlated significantly with OPLL compared with control cases. Especially, diabetes, hypertension, and renal disease were associated with patients with OPLL who underwent surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: Cavernous sinus (CS) invasion is an unfavorable factor hindering the remission of growth hormone (GH)-secreting pituitary adenomas. Little data exist on aggressive surgical resection, however. We investigated the role of CS exploration for GH-secreting pituitary adenomas with CS invasion.
   METHODS: We classified 132 patients with GHsecreting pituitary adenomas invading CS into 4 groups. The patients underwent surgery using a microsurgical transsphenoidal approach (TSA) with endoscopic assistance. Adenomas with CS invasion confined to the medial compartment of the internal carotid artery (ICA) were classified as type A (without radiologic evidence) or type B (with radiologic evidence). Adenomas with ICA encasement were classified according to the surgical approach as type C (standard TSA) or type D (far-lateral TSA). Surgical and endocrinologic outcomes were compared across groups.
   RESULTS: For type A, B, C, and D tumors, the rates of gross total resection were 100%, 73.6%, 14.7%, and 0%, respectively, and the rates of endocrinologic remission by surgery alone were 100%, 62.3%, 26.5%, and 0%, respectively. There was no endocrinologic remission by surgery alone for type D tumors; nevertheless, compared with type C tumors, type D tumors showed marked reductions in the postoperative nadir of GH at 1 week, 6 months, and 1 year and of insulin-like growth factor I at 1 year.
   CONCLUSIONS: For tumors with CS invasion confined to the medial compartment of the ICA, total resection should be attempted by direct visualization of the entire medial wall of the CS. Even for tumors with ICA encasement, aggressive tumor resection by far-lateral TSA can increase the chance of remission with the help of adjuvant treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: To date, no information about the cortical bone microstructural properties in atlas vertebrae with arcuate foramen has been reported. As a result, we aimed to test in an experimental model if there is a cortical bone thickening in an atlas vertebra which has an arcuate foramen that may play a protective role against bone fracture.
   METHODS: We analyzed by means of micro-computed tomography the cortical bone thickness, the cortical volume, and the medullary volume (SkyScan 1172 Bruker micro-CT NV, Kontich, Belgium) in cadaveric dry atlas vertebrae with arcuate foramen and without arcuate foramen. We also reviewed a case series of 31 posterior atlas arch fractures to correlate the possible presence in the same atlas of both fracture and arcuate foramen.
   RESULTS: The micro-computed tomography study revealed significant differences in cortical bone thickness (P < 0.001), cortical volume (P < 0.004), and medullary volume (P = 0.013) values between the arcuate foramen vertebrae and the nonarcuate foramen vertebrae. The clinical series found no coexistence in the same vertebra of a posterior atlas arch fractures and the arcuate foramen.
   CONCLUSIONS: An atlas with arcuate foramen presents cortical bone thickening. This advantage in bone micro-architecture seems to contribute to a lower fracture risk compared to subjects without arcuate foramen as no coexistence in the same vertebra of a posterior atlas arch fractures and arcuate foramen was found.

AB OBJECTIVE: To characterize dynamic changes of arteriovenous malformation using a microscope-integrated technique at the moment of performing intraoperative fluorescein videoangiography (FL-VAG) at each of the resection phases.
   METHODS: We prospectively recruited 12 patients with arteriovenous malformations and used FL-VAG as an ancillary technique for resection of the lesion. We analyzed transit time (TT) of FL in arterial feeders (arterial transit time [TTa]) and draining veins (venous transit time [TTv]) during the different stages of resection. To achieve this, we recorded 3 values of TT of FL (TTa, initial TTv, final TTv); when final TTv was markedly slower than initial TTv, we hypothesized that the nidus was devascularized enough and could be safely removed.
   RESULTS: No mortality or morbidity was related to use of FL. In most cases, TT values of arterial feeders and draining veins allowed an easier distinction between them. At advanced stages of resection, FL-VAG assessed increase in TTv (venous blood slower or absent), suggesting that most feeding arteries had been obliterated, indicating the appropriate-moment for nidus removal. Optimal dose of FL was a 75mg bolus followed by injection of 20 mL of saline solution.
   CONCLUSIONS: FL-VAG allows a distinction of normal from abnormal flow in draining vessels and might help the surgeon to decide when the nidus can be safely removed. This is the first study prospectively evaluating this technique, and it proposes an ideal dose for brain arteriovenous malformation surgery, in contrast to doses used in tumor cases.

AB OBJECTIVE: Blister aneurysms (BAs) represent a clinical challenge without a consensus treatment strategy. We report our institution's experience with BAs with an emphasis on the use of extracranial-to-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass.
   METHODS: Seventeen patients with BAs (88% [15/17] ruptured) were treated with microsurgical techniques (5 clip wrappings, 4 clip ligations, 4 EC-IC bypasses and clip trappings, 2 internal carotid artery ligations [1 combined with clip wrapping], and 2 clip trappings).
   RESULTS: Six of 17 patients experienced intraoperative ruptures. There were no intraoperative ruptures among the bypass cases and 75% (3/4) of patients achieved a good neurologic outcome. Further, a literature review was performed to identify all previously reported cases of BAs undergoing clip ligation, clip wrapping, EC-IC bypass/clip trapping, and endovascular therapies, encompassing 246 BA cases across 33 studies. Intraoperative ruptures occurred in 29% of clip ligations (23/79), 27.2% of clip wrappings (6/35), 16.1% of EC-IC bypasses (5/31), and 0% of endovascular treatments. Aneurysm recurrence occurred in 2.97% (3/101) with endovascular therapies to 0% with EC-IC bypass. Mortality was 8.8% for clip ligation/wrapping (10/114), 6.5% for EC-IC bypass (2/31), and 4.0% for endovascular treatments (4/101).
   CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular interventions have a favorable procedural safety profile but high rates of retreatment for persistent filling or posttreatment aneurysmal growth. Clip ligation and clip wrapping techniques have lower retreatment rates but slightly higher intraoperative risk. EC-IC bypass can safely provide definitive aneurysm securement and should be considered as a firstline therapy for BAs at high-volume bypass centers.

AB OBJECTIVE: Lumboperitoneal shunt (LPS) has been demonstrated an effective method for the treatment of communicating hydrocephalus in the presence of frequent shunt failure. The objective of the present study was to determine whether establishing a preoperative evaluation system could benefit patients, thus attenuating the risk of LPS failure.
   METHODS: In this 3-year study, treated by LPS, patients undergoing preoperative evaluation were included into the study group and other individuals without preoperative evaluation were included into the control group. Perioperative conditions, including Keifer's hydrocephalus score, symptomatic control rate, Evans index, complications, long-term shunt revision rate, and quality of life, were synchronously investigated.
   RESULTS: A total of 93 eligible patients were included in the study (study group, 51; control group, 42). The baseline characteristics of the 2 groups were basically similar. The results showed that patients in the study group had better short-term improvement in symptoms and imageology, including higher symptomatic control rate (median, 62.5% vs. 50%; P = 0.001), more reduction in Evans index (0.08 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.05 +/- 0.04; P = 0.002), and lower incidence of postoperative complications (median, 35.3% vs. 57.1%; P = 0.04). Similarly, the incidence of shunt revision in the study group was dramatically lower than in the control group (median, 15.7% vs. 40.9%; P =0.006) in line with the revision-free curve (P =0.002), which suggested that most of patients received revision, if needed, within 3 months. In addition, patients in the study group had better quality of life.
   CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, patients who underwent evaluation before LPS had better short-term and long-term outcomes, suggesting that it would be a promising strategy to correctly select patients for LPS with prolonged favorable shunt outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: Hemangioblastomas (HBs) are benign vascular tumors of the central nervous system and histologically contain abundant microvessels. Therefore, they clinically exhibit vascular malformation-like characteristics. It has been described that endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) contributes to the pathogenesis of cerebral cavernous malformations. However, it remains unknown whether EndMTcontributes to the pathogenesis of central nervous system HBs. The aim of our study was to investigate whether EndMT occurs in central nervous system HBs.
   METHODS: Ten central nervous system HBs were immunohistochemically investigated.
   RESULTS: Cluster of differentiation (CD) 31 (an endothelial marker) and EndMT markers, such as alpha-smooth muscle actin (a mesenchymal marker) and CD44 (a mesenchymal stem cell marker), were expressed in the endothelial layer of microvessels in all cases. These findings suggest that endothelial cells (ECs) of microvessels in central nervous system HBs have acquired mesenchymal and stem cellelike characteristics and undergone EndMT. In all cases, both ephrin-B2 and EphB4, which are not detected in adult normal brain vessels, were expressed in the endothelial layer of microvessels. These data suggest that ECs of microvessels in central nervous system HBs are immature or malformed cells and have both arterial and venous characteristics.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report showing the possibility that EndMT contributes to the pathogenesis of central nervous system HBs. It is likely that ECs of microvessels in central nervous system HBs are immature or malformed cells and have both arterial and venous characteristics. EndMT is expected to be a new therapeutic target in central nervous system HBs.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of atorvastatin on the surgical treatment of patients with chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH).
   METHODS: Our retrospective study included 245 consecutive adult patients undergoing burr-hole craniotomy for CSDH. Data included baseline characteristics and recurrence, postoperative complications, and mortality. Univariate and multivariate regression models analyzed the association between administration of atorvastatin perioperatively and recurrence rates.
   RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed perioperative atorvastatin administration (odds ratio [O R] 0.336; P = 0.039), diabetes mellitus (OR 3.949, P = 0.010), and GCS of 15 preoperatively (OR 0.197; P = 0.020) to be significantly related to recurrence risk. Postoperative complications and mortality did not significantly differ between patients with and those without atorvastatin therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that the administration of atorvastatin perioperatively is associated with a lower risk of CSDH recurrence rate. The use of atorvastatin perioperatively was not associated with higher rates of morbidity or mortality.

AB BACKGROUND: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a severe unilateral facial pain involving 1 or more branches of the trigeminal nerve (CNV). Microvascular decompression is a standard curative treatment of pharmacoresistant classic TN. Alternative procedures used for secondary or idiopathic TN usually lead to a high rate of pain recurrence and sensitive deficits. Partial sensory rhizotomy (PSR) is one of these ablative procedures. However, the lack of anatomic knowledge about the somatotopy of CNV lead to variable results in pain relief and hypoesthesia.
   OBJECTIVE: To refine the somatotopy of CNV and bring new anatomic landmarks for PSR, studying a cohort of patients treated by a targeted PSR (TPSR).
   METHODS: Retrospective and consecutive cases of adult patients treated in our institution between March 2000 and June 2015 for pharmacoresistant TN without vascular compression were collected. Our surgical procedure was performed using a precision map of the somatotopy of CNV. We compared our results with other surgical and nonsurgical therapies.
   RESULTS: Twenty-two patients had undergone TPSR. Fourteen had an idiopathic TN without compression of the nerve root, 6 had a secondary TN caused by multiple sclerosis, and 2 had a trigeminal conflict by inoperable tumor. Complete pain relief was achieved in 86.4% of the patients. Postoperative hypoesthesia was partial and focalized (22.7%). TN recurrence rate at 5 years was 31.5% (standard deviation, 10.9%).
   CONCLUSIONS: We clarified the functional somatotopy of CNV in its juxtapontine portion. TPSR is an interesting alternative to other ablative procedures to treat pharmacoresistant TN without vascular compression.

AB BACKGROUND: Essential tremor (ET) is a common movement disorder. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive neuroimaging method acquired in absence of task.
   OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to correlate pretherapeutic ventrolateral thalamus functional connectivity (FC) with clinical results 1 year after stereotactic radiosurgical thalamotomy (SRS-T) for drug-resistant ET. Data from 12 healthy control individuals were additionally included.
   METHODS: Resting state was acquired for 17 consecutive (right-handed) patients, before and 1 year after left unilateral SRS-T. Standard tremor scores were evaluated pretherapeutically and 1 year after SRS-T. Tremor network was investigated using region of interest, left ventrolateral ventral (VLV) cluster, obtained from pretherapeutic diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Seed-based FC was obtained as correlations between the time courses of the VLV and that of every other voxel. The seed-connectivity maps were obtained pretherapeutically and correlated across all patients with clinical outcome 1 year after SRST. One-year magnetic resonance signature volume was always located inside VLV and did not correlate with reported seed-FC measures (P > 0.05).
   RESULTS: We report statistically significant correlations between pretherapeutic VLV FC with clinical outcome for 1) right visual association area (Brodmann area, BA19) predicting 1 year activities of daily living decrease (P-unc = 0.02); 2) left fusiform gyrus (BA37) predicting 1 year head tremor score improvement (P-unc = 0.04); and 3) posterior cingulate (left BA23, P-uncor = 0.009), lateral temporal cortex (right BA21, P-unc = 0.02) predicting time to tremor arrest.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that pretherapeutic resting-state seed-FC of left VLV predicts tremor arrest after SRS-T for ET. Visual areas are identified as the main regions in this correlation.

ID PREDICTORS
AB BACKGROUND: Classic trigeminal neuralgia (TN) involves sharp, shooting pain in any trigeminal nerve distribution, whereas atypical TN presents with constant aching, numbness, or burning that can appear with classic features, leading to a mixed presentation. Microvascular decompression (MVD) is an effective treatment for classic TN, but its utility in treating mixed TN has been less well studied.
   METHODS: We retrospectively studied 73 adult patients with mixed TN and 386 patients with classic TN who underwent MVD between December 2007 and October 2016. Recorded variables included demographic data, graded radiologic and intraoperative findings, and graded pain outcomes in the immediate postoperative period (up to 3 months after MVD) and during long-term follow-up.
   RESULTS: The mean age of the 73 patients with mixed TN was 53.2 years. In terms of immediate postoperative outcomes, 67 patients (91.8%) experienced pain relief including improvement of atypical pain, whereas 6 patients (8.2%) had no pain relief. Having a preexisting pain syndrome (P [0.001) or distortion of the trigeminal nerve intraoperatively (P [0.001) was associated with poor surgical outcome in the patients with mixed TN. The mean duration of follow-up was 20.6 months. Forty-four patients (60.3%) developed recurrence of any TN pain. In comparison, 93% of the patients with classic TN experienced pain relief in the immediate postoperative period, and the recurrence rate was 19.9% in these patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with mixed TN suffer from both classic and atypical TN symptoms. Following MVD, 91.8% of our patients with mixed TN reported partial or complete pain relief, including improvement of atypical pain, in the immediate postoperative stage, compared with 93% of those with classic TN. Recurrence eventually developed in 60.3% of the patients with mixed TN.

AB In recent decades, hydrogen is considered as a secondary clean energy source, commonly referred to as an energy carrier. Hydrogen can be used to move, store and deliver energy in a form that can be easily used along with many other applications. Due to the significant role of hydrogen, a novel combined system for cogeneration of power and hydrogen is proposed in this paper. The proposed system is integrated from a Gas Turbine-Modular Helium Reactor (GT-MHR) and a biogas steam reforming (BSR) system to produce power and hydrogen, simultaneously. Biogas mixture consists of a considerable amount of methane and carbon dioxide as well as negligible amounts of other gases. A comprehensive thermodynamic modeling (i.e., energy and exergy analysis) of the proposed combined system is carried out. It is found that the proposed combined GT-MHR/BSR system can produce hydrogen and net output power of 0.217 kg/s and 260.13 MW, respectively. In this case, the overall exergy destruction rate, energy efficiency, and exergy efficiency of the combined GT-MHR/BSR system are calculated 329.31 MW, 47.69%, and 51.08%, respectively, showing a considerable enhancement in the efficiency of the basic system (GT-MHR cycle) from first and second laws of thermodynamics viewpoints. Moreover, the results of exergy analysis indicated that among all components, reactor core is accountable for the highest exergy destruction through the system (57.64%). To better understand the effect of various parameters on the performance of system, a comprehensive parametric study of some key thermodynamic parameters on performance criteria is performed. It is concluded that a higher energy and exergy efficiencies can be obtained by increasing the turbine inlet temperature, steam to carbon molar ratio, and turbine pressure ratio or decreasing the carbon dioxide to methane molar ratio and compressor pressure ratio. Last but not the least, it is demonstrated that the performance of the proposed integrated system can be maximized based on the reformer temperature.

AB The aim of this study is to increase the power generation/exergy efficiency and reduce total product cost/environmental contamination of solid oxide fuel cells. Accordingly, three integrated systems are proposed and analyzed from energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, and environmental viewpoints through the parametric study. The first model assesses the combination of a gasifier with a solid oxide fuel cell. In the second model, waste heat of the first model is reused in the Stirling engine to enhance the efficiency and power generation. The last model proposes reuse of the surplus power of the Stirling engine in a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer for hydrogen production. Considering total product cost, exergy efficiency, and hydrogen production rate as the objective functions, a multi-objective optimization is applied based on the genetic algorithm. The results indicate that at the optimum operating condition, the exergy efficiency of the model (a), (b), and (c) is 28.51%, 39.51%, and 38.03%, respectively. Corresponding values for the energy efficiency and the emission rate of the models are 31.13%, 67.38%, 66.41%, 1.147 t/MWh, 0.7113 t/MWh, 0.7694 t/MWh. At the optimum solution point, total product cost associated with the model (a), (b), and (c) is 19.33 $/GJ, 18.91 $/GJ, and 24.93 $/GJ, respectively. If the hydrogen production rate and total product cost considered as the objective functions, at optimum solution point, the rate of hydrogen production and overall product cost would be 56.5 kg/day and 41.76 $/GJ, respectively. Overall, the proposed integrated systems demonstrate decent functionality both in thermodynamic, environmental, and economic aspects.

AB The dual-loop Rankine cycle system is considered as the most effective way to recover the multi-grades waste heat of engine. However, the power consumption of mechanical pump is relative high, especially for that in the low-temperature loop of dual-loop Rankine cycle, which will influence the system efficiency and power output. Therefore, a thermofluidic pump driven by the engine coolant heat instead of electric energy is used to replace the mechanical pump of low-temperature loop in this paper. The effect of the design parameters on the performance of thermofluidic pump are analyzed firstly. There is always a reasonable height distribution among the components that makes the mass flow rate of thermofluidic pump achieve to maximum, which contributes to a smaller volume and less pressure fluctuation of pump. Then several working fluids are selected as the candidates for systems with thermofluidic pump and mechanical pump. Based on the comprehensive analysis (utilization rate of engine coolant, the energy and exergy efficiency, and output power), the R1234ze is regarded as the most suitable working fluid for both system with thermofluidic pump and system with mechanical pump. Afterwards, a comparison analysis between systems with thermofluidic pump and mechanical pump is implemented in the low-temperature loop. Results indicate that R1234ze based low-temperature loop with the thermofluidic pump has improvement of 7.6%, 9.1% and 7.7% on net power, thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency respectively compared with that of low-temperature loop with the mechanical pump. In addition, the mass flow rate will decrease by 8.6% in low-temperature loop, which conduces to reduce the size of component of cycle. All the results indicate that thermofluidic feed pump is an effective way to improve the performance of dual-loop system.

AB In recent years horizontal Ground Heat Exchangers (GHEs) has attracted a growing interest as heat source/sink for ground source heat pump systems. Horizontal GHEs initial installation costs are lower than the vertical ones; however, they require larger land area and more pipes. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce their required land area and pipe length by improving their thermal performance. In this study, a numerical modal based on 3-D simulation of GHE with computational fluid dynamics methods is developed. The model is used to evaluate the thermal performance and initial installation cost of horizontal GHEs. Four different types of horizontal GHEs: linear, spiral, horizontal and vertical slinky, and different soils types are considered. Obtained results indicated that the spiral and linear configurations have the lowest initial installation costs in single and parallel arrangements, respectively. Furthermore, a new design concept based on applying secondary soil with better thermal properties near the GHE pipes is introduced. It is shown that applying the secondary soil can improve the thermal GHE performance and reduce the initial installation cost of the horizontal GHE, when the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of the secondary soil is greater than those of the background soil.

AB Based on the literature-derived data on (co-)gasification, this paper aims to compare syngases obtained by steam gasification of different feedstocks (e.g. biomass, polyethylene, waste tire and coal) either single or mixed. The comparison among syngases was based on the variables that described the quality (i.e. content of H-2, CO, CH4 and CO2, H-2/CO, H-2 + CO), main operational parameters (gasification temperature, feeding ratio, scale of the gasification equipment) and the feedstock composition. These variables were summarized in two data sets and assessed by principal component analysis (PCA) in order to examine which of them have more determinant influence on differentiation of syngases produced by steam gasification of different feedstocks.
   Under wide range of gasification conditions considered in the study, syngases differed particularly in CH4 content and H-2/CO, while the lowest variability was observed for H-2 content. PCA revealed clear separation between syngases produced by gasification of single feed materials and those by co-gasification of the mixed feedstocks. Gases produced by mixed feed materials gasification had higher contents of CO2 and CO, while higher H-2 contents, H-2/CO and (H-2 + CO) values were linked with coal and tire processing. The observed outliers (not belonging to either of the separated groups) were syngases produced from tire under unique conditions compared to other considered systems (high temperature (1000 degrees C) or mixed gasifying agents).

AB Combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plants are becoming increasingly important for electricity generation. Enhancing their thermal performance is essential for mitigating carbon emissions. This paper aims to present a methodology for simulating the off-design operation of a triple-pressure reheat CCGT plant in Aspen HYSYS. The modeling equations that rigorously capture the full off-design characteristics of various plant components (i.e. compressor, combustor, turbine, heat recovery steam generator, and steam turbines) are implemented in Aspen HYSYS, and a specially tailored procedure is proposed for solving them. The modeling strategy and solution procedure can be extended to simulate the off-design operation of any CCGT plants and are generically applicable to other process simulators (e.g. Aspen Plus, Unisim, and Pro II). To evaluate the model's performance, its predictions are compared with those of an equivalent model from GateCycle. The results show the predictions of the two models (Aspen HYSYS and GateCycle) agree well. The average differences for the power outputs and thermal efficiencies of the gas turbine, steam cycle, and CCGT plant are less than 2.0%, 1.5%, and 0.6%, respectively. Besides, the differences arise primarily from the different gas enthalpy calculations. Since the model enables easy integration with various energy systems and can be made dynamic for predicting real-time behavior in Aspen HYSYS, it is very useful with wide applications.

AB An appropriate draw solution selection is a key to successful implementation of closed-loop pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) process for sustainable energy generation. In this study, the organic compounds potassium citrate, calcium acetate, potassium oxalate, potassium acetate, ammonium acetate, ammonium carbamate, ammonium formate, potassium formate, sodium glycolate, sodium propionate and calcium propionate were identified for the first time as highly effective draw solutions (except for NaP) using an easy desk-top screening method. This method identified these organic compounds by considering physical state at ambient condition, water solubility and osmotic pressure. The draw solutions were comprehensively evaluated for water flux, power density, and reverse salt flux through a laboratory-based investigation of the PRO process. The peak power densities achieved for the identified draw solutions were 5.32-6.73 W/m(2) at 2.8 MPa osmotic pressure. These peak power densities increased from 109% to 118% (11.1-14.64 W/m(2)) when increasing the osmotic pressure of the draw solutions by 50% (4.2 MPa). A significant increase in the peak power density was obtained due to the very low reverse salt flux for the organic draw solutions (0.029-0.0699 mol m(-2) 11-5 and 0.0325-0.0854 mol m(-2) h(-1) at osmotic pressures of 2.8 MPa and 4.2 MPa, respectively). The identified organic draw solutions were also analyzed as distillable and thermolytic through gravimetric method, for the identification of potential downstream recovery methods to recycle the draw solutions in the closed-loop PRO process. Membrane distillation could be used as a downstream separator technique for the distillable organic draw solutions; however, only the ammonium carbamate among the thermolytic compounds could be separated downstream by using a low-temperature thermal distillation process.

AB PV panels power conversion are strongly depending on chopper structure and maximum power point tracker algorithm, such as perturb and observe or increment conductance. In certain operating conditions these algorithms become inaccurate. The aim of this paper is the PV panel operation under partial shading. Until now it is solved by intelligent techniques (ANN, Fuzzy logic...) where the result cannot be explained and inaccurate under desert climate. It is proposed a new global maximum power point tracking based on detection and analyzing partial shading phenomena affecting PV panels characteristics behavior. The proposed DA-GMPPT permits a partial shading detection, once it appears and the location of the other maximum power points. Using this proposal the whole PV power system works at its optimal power point for any type of partial shading, even under aging effect.

AB The increase of power plants' conversion efficiencies, together with the high share of renewable energy sources in the electricity production for some countries, pushes for the use of heat pumps for space heating when aiming at reducing the associated primary energy consumption. However, the effective reduction of primary energy consumption should be supported by careful evaluations, as a number of parameters influence the heat pumps performance, including outdoor temperature, supply temperature, heat load and electricity primary energy factor. The variability of such parameters increases the complexity of the analysis, and annual or monthly average calculations might lead to incomplete evaluations and thus to sub-optimal solutions. This paper performs a hourly simulation of the operation of an air-source heat pump for space heating, relying on the available heat demand data of real buildings currently connected to a district heating network. In addition, the paper proposes the calculation of the hourly primary energy factor of the electricity supplied by the power grid, as the variability of the generation sources plays a key role in the global analysis of the energy system's conversion efficiency. The results show that in all the considered cases the heat pumps provide potential primary energy savings compared to natural gas boilers, thanks to the combined effect of their high coefficient of performance and the low electricity primary energy factor in the analyzed context. The primary energy consumption reduction obtained in each case is in the range 10-40%, with a median value close to 30%. Moreover, the comparison between average and high-resolution calculations of primary energy factors shows the possible underestimation of the potential primary energy savings when yearly or monthly data are adopted.

AB Large mean terminal temperature difference of conventional regenerative air heater and high superheat degree of bleeding steams are the bottleneck of conventional steam rankine cycle, which limits the cycle for further efficiency improvement. In this study, a state-of-the-art double reheat power plant is selected as the reference cycle. A novel cycle covering steam, water and air process is invented based on the systematic combination of flue gas heat recovery and bleeding steam cascade energy utilization.
   Thermodynamic model is developed to analyze the performance improvement and exergy method is applied to validate and identify the cycle thermodynamic efficiency advantage. Simulation result presents novel cycle net heat rate is improved by 104.8 kJ/kWh and cycle net efficiency is increased by 0.61%. Feed water pump turbine inlet steam connection optimization accounts for 14 kJ/kWh net heat rate benefits for the novel cycle. Feasibility study proves it is possible to implement the novel cycle in a newly planned power plant. Based on techno-economic analysis, it is found that the total investment capital of novel cycle is 7.44 million US dollars and net annual revenue is 0.59 million US dollars compared with the reference cycle. Static capital investment paid back period is expected within 15 years in a newly planned power plant.

AB This study illustrates the influence of ionic liquid (IL)-microwave heating on the direct transesterification (in-situ transesterification) of wet Nannochloropsis sp. biomass to biodiesel. The ionic liquid used was 1-ethyl-3-methylimmidazolium methyl sulphate [EMIM] [MeSO4]. Direct transesterification process variables such as the wet algae to methanol ratio, reaction time and methanol to IL ratio influencing the biodiesel production were optimised using response surface methodology (RSM). The results revealed that the maximum biodiesel yield (40.9%) was achieved when the ratio of wet algae to methanol (wt/vol) was kept at 1:4, methanol:IL ratio maintained at 1:0.5 at reaction time of 25 min. The FAMEs composition depicted a high content of unsaturated FAMEs suitable for biodiesel production. The synergetic effect of combining IL-methanol solvent and microwave heating at optimised reaction conditions enabled the production of an incredibly high biodiesel yield per dry biomass of 42.22%.

ID INDUCED VIBRATIONS
AB This paper presents the results of energy harvesting experiments with piezoelectric film transducers placed in swirling air flow. The turbulent flow was created by a centrifugal fan -swirler plate arrangement. The air flow field created had a Reynolds number of 15,000-130,000 and a swirl number of 0.3-0.4. The mounting mode of the piezoelectric film transducer allows for varying the position and orientation of the piezoelectric transducer to optimize energy harvesting. First, the output of the piezo-film was monitored by an oscilloscope. Static pressure was concurrently measured using a fast piezo-resistive pressure sensor. Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) was performed to the output signals in order to understand the interaction of the piezo-film with the turbulent eddies. The mechanical vibration modes were recorded by a camera. Finally, a voltage rectifying circuit board was connected to the piezo-film transducer and the voltage output was monitored in various fan frequencies. The average power output was monitored by measuring the voltage across a load resistance. A configuration of the piezo-film with a rectangular plastic attachment was also tested in order to decrease the eigenfrequency of the piezo-film. The longer piezo-film demonstrated shorter harvesting time cycle and thus increased power output. The optimum performance of the harvester was achieved at the lower mean flow velocities and reached the levels of 3 mu W.

AB This paper outlines a novel meanline off-design model to predict the performance characteristics of a radial inflow turbine that operates with ideal and real working fluids. Experimental data available in open literature were used for validation; including radial turbines that operate with both ideal gas (air) and real working fluids (R123). Initially the differences in the expansion process on a thermodynamic base between ideal and real fluids are highlighted. Then, the proposed meanline off-design model is calibrated for a few selected points and validated against experimental data for both air and R123. The comparison between the predicted and measured results presented errors less than 10% for both ideal and real gas fluids. Finally, the predicted air turbine was simulated with a real gas fluid. Relative to air, operation with R123 revealed that the peak efficiency is 12% lower and occurs at 70% lower rotational speed. The proposed methodology gives insights for accurate model based design of organic Rankine cycle systems, as the radial turbo expander is the most crucial and expensive component of such heat recovery systems.

AB In this paper, heat transfer characteristics of natural convection in an enclosure are investigated by considering variable thermal properties. The heated enclosure with an aspect ratio of unity is full of an alumina-water nanofluid. To analyze the effect of different thermal properties on the flow and temperature distributions, many comparisons are conducted for various cases at various Rayleigh numbers and volume fractions of nanoparticles (1-9.5%). The effect of low-gravity conditions on natural convection is investigated by using the gravity values of 0.25 g (2.45 m/s(2)), 0.5 g (4.9 m/s(2)), 0.75 g (7.35 m/s(2)) and 1.0 g (0.98 m/s(2)). It was found that larger temperature gradients near the heated and cold walls can be obtained by increasing the Rayleigh number. By increasing the value of gravity, the flow velocity increased along the y direction. This indicated that gravity has great influence on enhancement of heat transfer. The investigation of the volume fraction of nanoparticles shows that the variation of the Nusselt number for high volume fraction presented a more flat profile than for low volume fraction. The Nusselt number decreased with an increase of the volume fraction. Results for cases with connected and unconnected heated walls are presented. The results showed that heat transfer for the case with the nanoparticle volume fraction of 1% at 1.0 g increased by 89.9% using an unconnected heated wall compared to the connected heated wall.

AB In this paper a real time flow control integrated solar PV Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) charge controller for Vanadium Redox Flow battery (VRFB) is developed and its performance is demonstrated under practical dynamic insolation profiles. Unlike the conventional Lead acid and Li-ion batteries the major challenge in designing the solar MPPT charger for VRFB lies in simultaneous control of charging current and corresponding flow rate for maintaining the maximum overall system efficiency of the VRFB besides achieving the maximum charging efficiency. In this work, the usual Perturb & Observe (P&O) algorithm for designing MPPT charger for conventional batteries has been significantly modified in case of VRFB charge controller by including the real time control of flow rate along with the charging current. The proposed charging algorithm has been validated by a practical 1 kW 6 h VRFB system operation. The modified MPPT based three stage constant current constant voltage (CC-CV) charging topology is found to be the most efficient for VRFB charging from solar PV. Solar MPPT charging of VRFB with a constant flow rate leads to premature thermal shut down of the charge controller resulting incomplete charging of VRFB which is prevented by the use of dynamic flow control integrated solar PV MPPT charging. Two practical case studies of sunny weather and cloudy weather conditions have been adopted for validation of the integrated MPPT charge controller. The proposed VRFB charging system is a generalised one and thus can be very useful for large scale VRFB application in solar PV power systems.

AB This work focuses on the development of a control and diagnosis-oriented model of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) integrated system module (ISM). Fuel cell researchers and developers are currently investing significant resources on such fuel cell-based energy conversion systems, as a consequence of their adaptability to a variety of applications and power size. In this configuration, heat exchanges among components are difficult to manage and, consequently, reliable model-based tools are required to enhance the design phase. Therefore, the main heat exchange mechanisms (including radiation, here modeled via view-factors-based approach) are evaluated by simplifying 3-D geometries, as well as assuming the outlet temperature from each component as its state variable. The resulting lumped parameters model was proven effective in achieving the required compromise between accuracy and computational time, particularly in view of its real-world deployment for advanced balance of plant (BoP) analyses, as well as within control and diagnostic model-based tasks. Moreover, the entire SOFC ISM model is generic and can be suitably applied to different layouts, through the characterization of main model parameters. Simulation results are in agreement with experimental data collected on a non-conventional micro-CHP system, named HoTBox (TM), tested under nominal operating conditions within the EU funded project DIAMOND.

AB It is widely recognized that characteristics of fuel are strongly related with engine performance and exhaust emission. In this paper, a novel fuel blend is developed by adding carbon coated aluminium into diesel. Nanoparticles are blended with diesel in terms of different mass ratios, which are used for optimal selection. Thermo-physical properties of fuel blends are investigated at different testing temperatures. It is indicated that carbon coated aluminium is quite conducive to thermal conductivity but has little influence on viscosity. The highest thermal conductivity by using carbon coated aluminium could reach 0.23 W.m(-1).K-1 which is improved by 15% when compared with neat diesel. Then a series of experimental tests are conducted by using a heavy duty engine. Results show that at 1810 rpm speed, brake specific fuel consumption is in the range from 0.1 kg.kWh(-1) to 0.41 kg.kWh(-1). By using carbon coated aluminium, brake specific fuel consumption could be reduced by up to 13.3%. The maximum emission reduction by using novel fuel blend could reach 16.7%, 48.8% and 33.5% in terms of nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbon compound and carbon monoxide. Based on improved thermos-physical properties, positive effect of carbon coated aluminium on engine performance and emissions has been demonstrated.

AB In a global era, continuous increment in energy requisition with its associated cost and relevant climate problems is causing accentuation in exploring more efficient ways to provide cooling/air-conditioning in enclosed space without degrading the environment. In the hot and humid area, major part of conventionally produced electrical energy is consumed by air-conditioning. Also in the rapidly growing world, scarcity of clean water is dilemma as equal as green-house effect and ozone layer depletion. Thus, there is emergence of dehumidified air for human comfort with potable clean water at a same time. In the present paper, performance of the hybrid solar still has been evaluated for the regeneration of liquid desiccant and distillation of saline water for the three days in the month of March and April 2017 at the location 20.61 degrees N, 72.91 degrees E. For the experimentation, weak liquid desiccant (40% concentration) solution of Calcium Chloride (CaCl2) was selected whose stream flows through the upper basin and constant depth (10 mm) of saline water with 0.10% concentration of Zinc Oxide (ZnO) nanofluid, to improve the energy transfer, was maintained in the lower basin of hybrid solar still. The results show that the daily water desorption of 1417.22 ml/m(2), 1253.88 ml/m(2) and 1368.74 ml/m(2) was found from the weak solution of CaCl2 in upper basin with yield of 757.22 ml/m(2), 728.33 ml/m(2) and 727.78 ml/m(2) in lower basin for three days respectively. Considering still as dehumidifier/regenerator, daily average capacity obtained to absorb the latent heat from the humid air by the regenerated liquid desiccant was 0.168 kW, 0.148 kW and 0.143 kW respectively for the three days. The overall thermal efficiency of 16.74%, 25.39% and 26.19% was achieved for the three days respectively.

AB Water scarcity and environmental impacts of the steam power plants blow down, is one of the growing concerns. During the evaporation of water in the steam cycle of the power plant, most of the impurities of water and vapor do not evaporate and remain in the boiler. By increasing the concentration of these impurities, boiler tubes are corroded. To adjust the concentration of these impurities, some of the water in the cycle is drained, which is called blowdown. Blowdown water has a high exergy content that is going to be wasted. In this study, by recovering a great amount of contained water and heat of power plant blow down, the entering wastewater to the environment is decreased and the total power of power plant is increased. This recovery system includes Evaporator and Vacuum pump. In this system a vacuum is created in the vaccum tank by vacuum pump which causes the water to evaporate and is injected into the steam cycle. The results show that by adding the recovery system, the amount of drained wastewater from the plant to the surrounding environment decreases from 3.118 kg/s to 1.799 kg/s. After Energy and Exergy analysis, it is shown that the output power increases by 0.53%, and the exergy returns from 20.73% to 20.84%. Also, the effect of the Evaporator vacuum on the output power and the amount of recovered water indicates that with the reduction of the Evaporator vaccum pressure, the amount of the output power is reduced, but instead due to further evaporation of the water, the amount of recovered water in the Evaporator will increase. After Energy and Exergy analysis, the results are optimized by the Genetic Algorithm. The inlet temperature of HPT1, inlet pressure of HPT1, outlet pressure from each turbine, and pinch point for the first heat exchanger are considered as decision variables. Optimization results show that by obtaining suitable decisions variable amounts, output power is increased from 34.01 MW to 34.92 MW. For evaluating the results on the power plant operation, SEGS VI power plant in the US (California) is used.

AB This study was aimed at exergetically investigating a combined cycle power plant coupled with a parabolic trough solar field and high temperature energy storage system. Thermodynamic modeling of the combined cycle was conducted by ASPEN HYSYS simulation software, while the modeling of solar and energy storage section was carried out using MATLAB software. The main goal of the present research work was to reveal the reasons and sources of the thermodynamic losses occurring in the power plant based on the thermodynamic outcomes obtained from modeling. After writing the exergy balance equations for all the subunits of the power plant, their exergetic performance parameters were measured individually. Moreover, the effect of different influential parameters such as gas turbine inlet temperature and outlet pressure, and the R113 working fluid mass flow rate on the exergy and electrical efficiencies of the whole system was also investigated and scrutinized. The exergetic value of the net electric power was found to be 93,580 kW. The overall exergy destruction of the system stood at 216,710 kW. The contribution of solar and energy storage combination, as the main subunit wasting exergy, to the overall exergy destruction of the system was determined at 43%. Moreover, combustion chamber subunit stood in the next rank in terms of exergy destruction, contributing 15.7% of the overall exergy destruction of the power plant. The overall exergy efficiency and electrical efficiency of the power cycle was determined at 38.2% and 47%, respectively.

AB Since typical CO2 capture technologies lack the consideration of a reliable CO2 storage method or integration with CO2 utilization, this study proposes a new chemical looping reforming process for syngas production with simultaneous CO2 capture and utilization. It integrates chemical looping, mixed reforming (i.e. CO2 reforming and partial oxidation) and calcium looping using CO2 carriers (CCs) and oxygen carriers (OCs). This novel process implements energy-efficient operation, attains flexible H-2/CO ratio, and captures CO2 with immediate CO2 conversion. Through thermodynamic screening, Fe- and Cu-based metal/metal oxides and CaO and MnO are identified as the potential OCs and CCs. For process characteristics, almost full CO2 capture is achieved, CH4 conversion rate is over 92.11%, maximum CO2 utilization rate is 99.18%, H-2/CO ratio is close to 2, and energy consumption is reduced by 40.74% and 68.62% compared to that of conventional mixed reforming and trireforming processes, respectively. Steam addition, low pressure and high temperature are benefit to enhance system performance. From experiment results, gas product distribution, solid reactivity and crystalline phases for solid demonstrate the feasibility of this novel process. More importantly, this process provides a new route to achieve integrated CO2 capture and conversion with the clean usages of carbonaceous energy sources.

AB One of the measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and increase energy efficiency in a combined cycle power plant is the improving of its thermodynamic efficiency by optimizing the heat utilization s study, a mathematical model of the bottoming cycle of a combined cycle power plant was developed in Matlab. The heat recovery steam generator, which is a crucial element of the bottoming cycle, is modeled as a heat exchanger network. It consists of multiple pressure levels and a reheater that uses organic working fluids in the lower pressure levels. The mathematical model provides the possibility that the heat exchangers in each pressure level could be in parallel and serial arrangements. An exergoeconomic optimization was conducted, where the optimization variables comprised the heat exchanger layout and the operating parameters of the working fluid in each pressure level. The objective of the optimization was to minimize the sum of the cost of exergy destruction in the bottoming cycle and investment costs. The genetic algorithm and gradient optimization methods were used as optimization tools. The results show that lower cost of exergy destruction can be achieved by optimizing the heat exchanger layout and using organic fluids in the lower pressure levels of a heat recovery steam generator. This research work addresses a gap in the literature by taking into account the heat exchanger layout, optimization parameters, and organic fluids while optimizing a bottoming cycle, which is of essential importance.

AB In order to mitigate the environmental pollution and ease the energy consumption intensity, the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) and combined heating and power (CHP) system is expected to be widely applied throughout the world. This paper proposes a hybrid distributed energy resources (DER) system integrating CHP, photovoltaic (PV) and wind power, to handle the electrical and thermal load for residential buildings. The system economic, technical and environmental performance is analyzed in seven typical Chinese cities based on various evaluation indicators. Moreover, a non-renewable grid-connected energy system is assessed as a reference system. It is found that the optimized DER system not only meets load supplying, but also effectively minimizes emissions and system lifetime costs. DER systems are of great advantages over reference systems in almost all optimal evaluations, especially in Beijing, Wuhan, Shanghai and Nanjing. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the economic performance of DER system will become better with increase feed-in tariff, decrease local grid tariff and natural gas price. The impacts of subsidy coefficient and loan ratio on return on investment are more significant than other factors.

AB This paper presents a new stepped solar still proposed to improve the daily productivity of the conventional basin type solar still (CSS). An internal Multi-Tray Evaporator (MTE) was integrated against the still rear-wall to act as an additional evaporation area. The MTE's effect on the still performances has been evaluated through experimental tests under different meteorological conditions in the region of Adrar-Algeria. The still productivity improvement is demonstrated through a comparative study between the proposed solar still and the conventional still. The experimental data show that the productivity of the proposed stepped solar still is higher than that for conventional still by about 47.18-104.73%. It was found that the estimated cost of distilled water and the payback period, for the stepped solar still are 0.01 $/kg and 70 days, respectively. While, for the simple solar still, they are estimated at 0.0145 $/kg and 100 days.

AB Fluidic flexible matrix composites (F2MCs) are composite tubes that consist of multiple layers of oriented, high performance fibers, such as carbon, precisely placed in a flexible matrix resin to form high-mechanical advantage actuators and variable stiffness materials. Unique to the F2MC tube is its ability to generate high pressures and volume change with a small external load as a result of the stiff reinforcement fiber orientation in the wall of the tube and the soft supporting elastomer. When a load is applied to the tubes, the volume of the F2MC tube is reduced and fluid is forced out of the tube by the reinforcing fibers. This is the first reported research on the design, fabrication, and characterization of F2MC tubes as power take-off (PTO) mechanisms for ocean wave energy conversion where the heaving motion of a floating body in waves provides the axial load that drives fluid through the pumps. An analytical model is developed to predict the performance of F2MC pumps in a variety of test conditions, and 1/50th scale F2MCs pumps are tested in a water basin. The scaled pumps are mechanically cycled between 0 Hz and 2 Hz at up to 17 percent strain replicating ocean waves of varying period and amplitude. Instantaneous input mechanical power and output fluid power values are calculated from force, velocity, pressure, and flow rate measurements, and the actuator efficiency is subsequently determined and compared with the prediction of the analytical model. At 1/50th scale, a maximum power conversion efficiency of 40 percent is obtained for a single pump and a peak output power of 0.21 W is recorded. At full scale, the predicted peak output power is 180 kW, suggesting that F2MC pumps are a promising class of fluid power takeoff (PTO) mechanisms for ocean wave energy conversion, representing a substantial improvement over hydraulic cylinders.

AB Fuel properties play important roles both in the physical process of fuel air mixing and chemical process of combustion in the cylinder of diesel engines. There are many parameters to represent physical and chemical properties of a diesel fuel, which may affect combustion of diesel engine to different degrees. It is valuable to deeply understand the effects of fuel properties and the relations between some major properties as well. Therefore, the effects of diesel fuel properties on combustion and emissions have been experimentally investigated on a heavy-duty diesel engine in this study. In addition, the relationships among some major properties have been discussed. Twelve fuels with different fuel properties, which were produced by different refining processes from different refineries in China, were selected to ensure that the tested fuels have a wide representative. The results show that there is a strong correlation between fuel density and other fuel properties such as cetane number, aromatic hydrocarbon fraction, heat value, etc. Especially, the linear regression model between density and cetane number shows a certain reference significance. The cetane number of fuel with high density is low, which results in the delay of combustion and the rise of peak heat release rate at low load. There is no significant difference in brake thermal efficiency (BTE) for fuels with different fuel properties in the current study. However, the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) increases with the increase of fuel density because of the decrease in heat value. As the fuel density increases, the NOx emissions increase accordingly and the soot emissions roughly show an increasing trend as well. At low load, both CO and HC emissions obviously increase with the increase of fuel density. For example, at low load and low speed, CO and HC increase by 256%, 158% respectively as the fuel density increases from 800 kg/m(3) to 920 kg/m(3). Nonetheless, CO emissions remain a low level and show no obvious changes at medium and high loads, which is different from HC emissions that increase gradually especially for high speed conditions. The results of the European Steady-state Cycle (ESC) show that weighted BSFC and weighted emissions exhibit strong correlations with fuel density. When fuel density is bigger than a certain value (about 845 kg/m(3)), a rapid increasing trend is presented in the emissions of NOx, soot, CO and HC.

AB Several heterogeneous catalysts have been utilized for biodiesel synthesis from low-grade oils containing free fatty acids (FFA) in a two-stage esterification and transesterification method in previous studies. In this study, NaOH-bentonite impregnated with graphene oxide (GO), as a novel bi-functional heterogeneous catalyst for simultaneous esterification and transesterification was developed and characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), N-2 adsorption measurement to obtain the surface area (BET) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD NH3 and CO2). The effect of reaction time (h), reaction temperature (degrees C), methanol-to-oil ratio and catalyst amount (wt%) was studied. All experiments were performed at an optimized GO-to-NaOH-bentonite ratio of 1:20. Impressively, the GO-NaOH-bentonite catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic performance and resulted in 89.5 wt% conversion of free fatty acids and 98.5 wt% overall biodiesel yield after 4.5 h reaction time with catalyst amount of 6 wt%, reaction temperature of 62 degrees C and 6:1 methanol-to-oil ratio. Results showed that the presence of Na2O enhanced the low-strength basic sites of the catalyst at 150-200 degrees C, which played the key role in transesterification of rapeseed oil. It was also found that, the presence of GO on NaOH-bentonite, increased the overall acid strength of the composite catalyst by providing more Bronsted acidic sites. The acidic-basic nature of GO-NaOH-bentonite improved the accessibility of methanol to oil and FFA with the increased pore size of the composite catalyst.

AB Accurate modeling plays an important role in solar cell simulation. In order to reveal the applicability and superiority of Special Trans function based single diode model (SBSDM), this paper presents a comprehensive comparison of SBSDM, Lambert W function based single diode model (LBSDM) and exponential-type single diode model (SDM). The performance difference of SBSDM, LBSDM and SDM is verified and compared in two aspects: (1) different fitness to the measured I-V data of solar cells and (2) different parameter extraction performance. To be objective and reproducible, the reported parameter values of standard datasets and measured datasets are employed to validate the fitness difference of the three models. The comparison results indicate that SBSDM always exhibits better fitness than LBSDM and SDM in representing the I-V characteristics of various solar cells and can provide a closer prediction to actual maximum power points. With the help of a ranking based branch selection strategy, a modified Nelder-Mead simplex (MNMS) algorithm is proposed to test the parameter extraction performance of SBSDM, LBSDM and SDM. The comparison results reveal that the time computational efficiency of SBSDM is inferior to SDM but superior to LBSDM. SBSDM always achieves superior accuracy and convergence speed than LBSDM and SDM, although lacking enough statistical robustness. Due to these superiorities, SBSDM is quite promising and envisaged to be the most valuable model for solar cell parameter extraction and PV system simulation.

AB Organic waste residues can be hydrothermally treated to produce organic acid rich liquors. These hydrothermal liquors are a potential feedstock for polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production. We investigated the effect of dissolved oxygen concentration and substrate feeding regimes on PHA accumulation and yield using two hydrothermal liquors derived from a mixture of primary and secondary municipal wastewater treatment sludge and food waste. The enriched culture accumulated a maximum of 41% PHA of cell dry weight within 7 h; which is among the highest reported for N and P rich hydrothermal liquors. Recovered PHA was 77% polyhydroxybutyrate and 23% polyhydroxyvalerate by mass. The families Rhodocyclaceae (84%) and Saprospiraceae (20.5%) were the dominant Proteobacteria (73%) in the enriched culture. The third most abundant bacterial genus, Bdellovibrio, includes species of known predators of PHA producers which may lead to suboptimal PHA accumulation. The PHA yield was directly proportional to DO concentration for ammonia stripped liquor (ASL) and inversely proportional to DO concentration for low strength liquor (LSL). The highest yield of 0.50 Cmol PHA/Cmol substrate was obtained for ASL at 25% DO saturation. A progressively increasing substrate feeding regime resulted in increased PHA yields. These findings demonstrate that substrate feeding regime and oxygen concentration can be used to control the PHA yield and accumulation rate thereby enhancing PHA production viability from nutrient rich biomass streams.

AB Cyanobacterial blooms have emerged as one of the most severe ecological problems affecting large and shallow freshwater lakes. To improve our understanding of the factors that influence, and could be used to predict, surface blooms, this study developed a novel Euler-Lagrangian coupled approach combining the Eulerian model with agent-based modelling (ABM). The approach was subsequently verified based on monitoring datasets and MODIS data in a large shallow lake (Lake Taihu, China). The Eulerian model solves the Eulerian variables and physiological parameters, whereas ABM generates the complete life cycle and transport processes of cyanobacterial colonies. This model ensemble performed well in fitting historical data and predicting the dynamics of cyanobacterial biomass, bloom distribution, and area. Based on the calculated physical and physiological characteristics of surface blooms, principal component analysis (PCA) captured the major processes influencing surface bloom formation at different stages (two bloom clusters). Early bloom outbreaks were influenced by physical processes (horizontal transport and vertical turbulence-induced mixing), whereas buoyancy-controlling strategies were essential for mature bloom outbreaks. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) revealed the combined actions of multiple environment variables on different bloom clusters. The effects of buoyancy-controlling strategies (ISP), vertical turbulence-induced mixing velocity of colony (VMT) and horizontal drift velocity of colony (HDT) were quantitatively compared using scenario simulations in the coupled model. VMT accounted for 52.9% of bloom formations and maintained blooms over long periods, thus demonstrating the importance of wind-induced turbulence in shallow lakes. In comparison, HDT and buoyancy controlling strategies influenced blooms at different stages. In conclusion, the approach developed here presents a promising tool for understanding the processes of onshore/offshore algal blooms formation and subsequent predicting. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The self-forming dynamic membrane bioreactor (SFDMBR) is a biological wastewater treatment technology based on the conventional membrane bioreactor (MBR) with membrane material modification to a large pore size (30-100 mu m). This modification requires a dynamic layer formed by activated sludge to provide effective filtration function for high-quality permeate production. The properties of the dynamic layer are therefore important for permeate quality in SFDMBRs. The interaction between the structure of the dynamic layer and the performance of SFDMBRs is little known but understandably complex. To elucidate the interaction, a lab-scale SFDMBR system coupled with a nylon woven mesh as the supporting material was operated. After development of a mature dynamic layer, excellent solid-liquid separation was achieved, as evidenced by a low permeate turbidity of less than 2 NTU. The permeate turbidity stayed below this level for nearly 80 days. In the fouling phase, the dynamic layer was compressed with an increase in the trans-membrane pressure and the quality of the permeate kept deteriorating until the turbidity exceeded 10 NTU. The investigation revealed that the majority of permeate particles were dissociated from the dynamic layer on the back surface of the supporting material, which is caused by the compression, breakdown, and dissociation of the dynamic layer. This phenomenon was observed directly in experiment instead of model prediction or conjecture for the first time. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sewage sludge is an inevitable byproduct from municipal wastewater treatment processes and conversion of sewage sludge into high value-added biochar is an effective strategy for resource utilization of sewage sludge. The characterization on P speciation is important to control the practical applications and environmental behavior of the sewage sludge and its derived biochar. The mobility and bioavailability of P is closely related to its speciation, but knowledge gap in P speciation is still existed which needs to be narrowed by a systematic study including existing experimental methods and techniques as well as theoretical prediction. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of P speciation, this study conducted a series of research combining conventional fractionation of P with consideration of major concomitant elements (Al, Ca, Fe), advanced analytical techniques (solution and solid-state P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray diffraction (XRD)), and theoretical simulation with respect to solubility of major elements in different acid-base extractants. Results showed that Ca and Fe were dominantly extracted by HCl whereas P and Al were both NaOH- and HCl-soluble. Inorganic orthophosphates were detected as predominant molecular configurations of P from solution P-31 NMR spectra, while the existence of calcium and aluminum orthophosphates was revealed by solid-state P-31 NMR. Moreover, the poor crystalline AIPO(4) mineral was further evidenced by XRD patterns of the sewage sludge and biochar. Finally, a theoretical simulation of P-containing minerals was performed on the basis of results above. which suggested the existence of variscite/berlinite and amorphous Ca-3(PO4)(2) in the sludge and biochar. This study does not only explore the P speciation in the sewage sludge and its derived biochar, but also provides a methodology for further research on P speciation. Through the intensive study on the environmental behavior of P, this work might further contribute to the fundamental knowledge basis for the recycle of P during integrate waste management.

AB N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a probable human carcinogen disinfection by-product, has been detected in chloraminated drinking water systems. Understanding its formation over time is important to control NDMA levels in distribution systems. The main objectives of this study were to investigate the role of chloramine species (i.e., monochloramine and dichloramine); and the factors such as pH, sulfate, and natural organic matter (NOM) influencing the formation of NDMA. Five NDMA precursors (i.e., dimethylamine (DMA), trimethylamine (TMA), N,N-dimethylisopropylarnine (DMiPA), NN-dimethylbenzylamine (DMBzA), and ranitidine (RNTD)) were carefully selected based on their chemical structures and exposed to varying ratios of monochloramine and dichloramine. All amine precursors reacted relatively fast to form NDMA and reached their maximum NDMA yields within 24 h in the presence of excess levels of chloramines (both mono- and dichloramine) or excess levels of dichloramine conditions (with limited monochloramine). When the formation of dichloramine was suppressed (i.e., only monochloramine existed in the system) over the 5 day contact time, NDMA formation from DMA, TMA, and DMiPA was drastically reduced (similar to 0%). Under monochloramine abundant conditions, however, DMBzA and RNTD showed 40% and 90% NDMA conversions at the end of 5 day contact time, respectively, with slow formation rates, indicating that while these amine precursors react preferentially with dichloramine to form NDMA, they can also react with monochloramine in the absence of dichloramine. NOM and pH influenced dichloramine levels that affected NDMA yields. NOM had an adverse effect on NDMA formation as it created a competition with NDMA precursors for dichloramine. Sulfate did not increase the NDMA formation from the two selected NDMA precursors. pH played a key role as it influenced both chloramine speciation and protonation state of amine precursors and the highest NDMA formation was observed at the pH range where dichloramine and deprotonated amines coexisted. In selected natural water and wastewater samples, dichloramine led to the formation of more NDMA than monochloramine. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is a growing interest for the use of coliphage as an alternative indicator to assess fecal pollution in recreational waters. Coliphage are a group of viruses that infect Escherichia coli and are considered as potential surrogates to infer the likely presence of enteric viral pathogens. We report the use of a dead-end hollow fiber ultrafiltration single agar layer method to enumerate F+ and somatic coliphage from surface waters collected from three Great Lake areas. At each location, three sites (two beaches; one river) were sampled five days a week over the 2015 beach season (n = 609 total samples). In addition, culturable E. coli and enterococci concentrations, as well as 16 water quality and recreational area parameters were assessed such as rainfall, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, pH, and ultra violet absorbance. Overall, somatic coliphage levels ranged from non-detectable to 4.39 log(10) plaque forming units per liter and were consistently higher compared to F+ (non-detectable to 3.15 log(10) PEON, regardless of sampling site. Coliphage concentrations weakly correlated with cultivated fecal indicator bacteria levels (E. coli and enterococci) at 75% of beach sites tested in study (r = 0.28 to 0.40). In addition, ultraviolet light absorption and water temperature were closely associated with coliphage concentrations, but not fecal indicator bacteria levels suggesting different persistence trends in Great Lake waters between indicator types (bacteria versus virus). Finally, implications for coliphage water quality management and future research directions are discussed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The improvement of feed spacers with optimal geometry remains a key challenge for spiral-wound membrane systems in water treatment due to their impact on the hydrodynamic performance and fouling development. In this work, novel spacer designs are proposed by intrinsically modifying cylindrical filaments through perforations. Three symmetric perforated spacers (1-Hole, 2-Hole, and 3-Hole) were in-house 3D-printed and experimentally evaluated in terms of permeate flux, feed channel pressure drop and membrane fouling. Spacer performance is characterized and compared with standard no perforated (0-Hole) design under constant feed pressure and constant feed flow rate. Perforations in the spacer filaments resulted in significantly lowering the net pressure drop across the spacer filled channel. The 3-Hole spacer was found to have the lowest pressure drop (50%-61%) compared to 0-Hole spacer for various average flow velocities. Regarding permeate flux production, the 0-Hole spacer produced 5.7 L m(-2).h(-1) and 6.6 Lm(-2).h(-1) steady state flux for constant pressure and constant feed flow rate, respectively. The 1-Hole spacer was found to be the most efficient among the perforated spacers with 75% and 23% increase in permeate production at constant pressure and constant feed flow, respectively. Furthermore, membrane surface of 1-Hole spacer was found to be cleanest in terms of fouling, contributing to maintain higher permeate flux production. Hydrodynamic understanding of these perforated spacers is also quantified by performing Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). The performance enhancement of these perforated spacers is attributed to the formation of micro jets in the spacer cell that aided in producing enough unsteadiness/turbulence to clean the membrane surface and mitigate fouling phenomena. In the case of 1-Hole spacer, the unsteadiness intensity at the outlet of micro-jets and the shear stress fluctuations created inside the cells are higher than those observed with other perforated spacers, resulting in the cleanest membrane surface.

AB Electrochemical oxidation (ECO) has shown good potential for disinfection of wastewater discharges but has not been tested for stormwater. Due to far lower salinity and chloride levels present in stormwater than in wastewaters, the knowledge so far on the ECO disinfection performance cannot simply be used for stormwater applications. This paper presents the first study on the feasibility of ECO technology for disinfection of pre-treated stormwater. Disinfection performance of E. coli was tested using a dimensional stable anode (DSA) in a series of batch experiments with synthetic stormwater of 'typical' chemical and microbial composition. The results showed that effective disinfection could be achieved with very low energy consumption; e.g. the current density of 1.74 mA/cm(2) achieved total disinfection in 1.3 min, using only 0.018 kWh per ton of stormwater treatment. Chlorination was found to be the key disinfection mechanism, despite the synthetic stormwater containing only 9 mg/L of chloride. Real stormwater collected from three stormwater treatment systems in Melbourne was then used to validate the findings for indigenous microbe species. Disinfection below the detection limit was achieved for stormwater from the two sites where chloride levels were 9 and 200 mg/l, respectively, but not for the third site where stormwater contained only 2 mg/L chloride. Unfortunately, deterioration of the DSA anode was observed after only 8-10 h of its cumulative operation time, very likely due to high voltage that had to be applied to low saline stormwater to achieve the required current density. In conclusion, ECO was found to be a very promising low energy disinfection technology for stormwater, but far more work is needed to optimise the technology for unique stormwater conditions.

AB This study develops life cycle water footprints for the production of fuels and chemicals via thermo-chemical conversion of algae biomass. This study is based on two methods of feedstock production - ponds and photobioreactors (PBRs) - and four conversion pathways - fast pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), conventional gasification, and hydrothermal gasification (HTG). The results show the high fresh water requirement for algae production and the necessity to recycle harvested water or use alternative water sources. To produce 1 kg of algae through ponds, 1564 L of water are required. When PBRs are used, only 372 L water are required; however, the energy requirements for PBRs are about 30 times higher than for ponds. From a final product perspective, the pathway based on the gasification of algae biomass was the thermochemical conversion method that required the highest amount of water per MJ produced (mainly due to its low hydrogen yield), followed by fast pyrolysis and HTL. On the other hand, HTG has the lowest water footprint, mainly because the large amount of electricity generated as part of the process compensates for the electricity used by the system. Performance in all pathways can be improved through recycling channels. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrate has been recognized as a global threat to environmental health. In this regard, the hyporheic zone (saturated media beneath and adjacent to the stream bed) plays a crucial role in attenuating groundwater nitrate, prior to discharge into surface water. While different nitrate removal pathways have been investigated over recent decades, the adsorption capacity of hyporheic sediments under natural conditions has not yet been identified. In this study, the natural attenuation capacity of the hyporheic-sediments of the Ghezel-Ozan River, located in the north-west of Iran, was determined. The sampled sediments (from 1 m below the stream bed) were characterized via XRD, FT-IR, BET, SEM, BA and Zeta potential. Nitrate adsorption was evaluated using a batch experiment with hyporheic pore-water from each study site. The study was performed in the hyporheic sediments of two morphologically different zones, including Z(1) located in the parafluvial zone having the clay sediment texture (57.8% clay) with smectite/Illite mixed layer clay type and Z(2) located in the river confluence area containing silty clay sediment texture (47.6% clay) with smectite/kaolinite mixed layer clay type. Data obtained from the batch experiment were subjected to pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, intra-particle diffusion, and Elovich mass transfer kinetic models to characterize the nitrate adsorption mechanism. Furthermore, to replicate nitrate removal efficiencies of the hyporheic sediments under natural conditions, the sampled hyporheic pore-waters were applied as initial solutions to run the batch experiment. The results of the artificial nitrate solution correlated well with pseudo-second order (R-2>95%; in both Z(1) and Z(2)) and maximum removal efficiencies of 85.3% and 71.2% (adsorbent dosage 90 g/L, pH = 5.5, initial adsorbate concentration of 90 mg/L) were achieved in Z(1) and Z(2), respectively. The results of the nitrate adsorption analysis revealed that the nitrate removal efficiencies varied from 17.24 +/- 1.86% in Z(1) during the wet season to 28.13 +/- 0.89% in Z(2) during the dry season. The results obtained by this study yielded strong evidence of the potential of hyporheic sediments to remove nitrate from an aqueous environment with great efficiency.

AB Seawater treatment is increasingly required due to industrial activities that use substantial volumes of seawater in their processes. The shipping industry and the associated management of a ship's ballast water are currently considered a global challenge for the seas. Related to that, the suitability of an Electrochemical Advanced Oxidation Process (EAOP) with Boron Doped Diamond (BDD) electrodes has been assessed on a laboratory scale for the disinfection of seawater. This technology can produce both reactive oxygen species and chlorine species (especially in seawater) that are responsible for inactivation. The EAOP was applied in a continuous-flow regime with real seawater. Natural marine heterotrophic bacteria (MHB) were used as an indicator of disinfection efficiency. A biphasic inactivation kinetic model was fitted on experimental points, achieving 4-Log reductions at 0.019 Ah L-1. By assessing regrowth after treatment, results suggest that higher bacterial damages result from the EAOP when it is compared to chlorination. Furthermore, several issues lacking fundamental understanding were investigated such as recolonization capacity or bacterial community dynamics. It was concluded that, despite disinfection processes being effective, there is not only a possibility for regrowth after treatment but also a change on bacterial population diversity produced by the treatment. Finally, energy consumption was estimated and indicated that 0.264 kWh.m(-3) are needed for 4.8-Log reductions of MHB; otherwise, with 0.035 kWh.m(-3), less disinfection efficiency can be obtained (2.2-Log red). However, with a residual oxidant in the solution, total inactivation can be achieved in three days. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding changes in water quality over time and landscape and anthropogenic factors affecting them are of paramount importance to human and ecosystem health. We analyzed the seasonal trends of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chemical oxygen demand, and total suspended solid (SS) in the Han River Basin (HRB) of South Korea using the Mann-Kendall test. We explored the effects of anthropogenic (land cover and population) and natural factors (topography and soil) on the trends by using Moran's Eigenvector based spatial filtering regressions at four different spatial scales. Water quality of the HRB generally improved from the early 1990s to 2016 with decreasing summer nutrient and winter SS concentrations. Water quality trends were spatially autocorrelated with distinct spatial variations within the basin. Some stations close to the Seoul metropolitan area, however, still exhibited poor water quality conditions. Approximately 20-70 percent of spatial variation of different water quality trends were explained by some combination of current agricultural land cover, forest land cover, % area covered by water, change in those land covers and slope variations. The 100 m buffer and one-kilometer upstream scale analyses generally showed higher explanatory power than the sub-watershed scale analyses, while the effect of seasons differed for different parameters. The significant factors in each regression model typically differed among different scales but not among different seasons of the same scale. The spatial filtering approach removed the residual spatial autocorrelation and thus significantly increased the explanatory power of water quality trend models.

AB Rainfall event simulation can be very useful in many hydrological and hydraulic practices such as darn design. The aim of this study is to propose a new single-site stochastic model for generating daily rainfall events. The model has two components: Copula-based joint simulation of rainfall characteristics and rainfall temporal pattern simulation. Compared with prevailing stochastic rainfall models, this new model can not only preserve the dependence relationship between rainfall duration and rainfall depth by using Copula functions, but also take different temporal rainfall patterns that can cause various hydrological responses of watersheds into consideration. Additionally, the internal clustering validation index is introduced in this study to objectively determine the number of representative rainfall patterns in this model. Lastly, a framework is designed to apply the developed stochastic model to 39 gauged meteorological stations in Zhejiang Province, East China and to extend its application to one ungauged site for validation. The final validation results were sound and indicated that the developed stochastic model is robust and can be applied at both gauged stations and ungauged sites for generating long rainfall records.

AB Equitable distribution of agricultural and ecological water is a great challenge, which has important implications for food safety, with models required to calculate agricultural economic losses caused through protection of the ecological basic flow of rivers. A new model has been used to calculate agricultural economic losses caused by river ecological basic flow in the Baoji Section of the Weihe River, which is the largest tributary of the Yellow River, China. Results show that agricultural economic losses were negatively correlated to high levels of water runoff, with the agricultural water sector often unable to safeguard river ecological basic flow systems when annual food safety guarantee levels of 400 kg per person were met. Water-saving measures could be used to help protect river ecological basic flow, based on policies of agricultural ecological compensation, water rights transactions and encouraging the public to employ appropriate water-saving measures. However, whilst recommendations from this study enabled the agricultural water department to decrease economic losses and improve food safety guarantee levels, they could not provide full protection of river ecological basic flow.

AB Traditional methods for characterizing horizontally anisotropic aquifers are all based on pumping tests. In this paper, we present a new method for the identification of horizontal anisotropy using cross-hole slug tests, which is much more easily accessible comparing to pumping tests. Through scaler transform, an anisotropic medium was converted into an equivalent isotropic medium. When applying the analytical solutions derived for isotropic media to interpret cross-hole slug tests performed in anisotropic media, the estimated transmissivity is the geometrical mean of the anisotropic transmissivity tensor, regardless of sampling direction. However, the apparent storativity calculated from different observation wells, is equal to the true storativity scaled by a factor defined by the formation anisotropy. Thus, anisotropy can be resolved through apparent storativity that bears directional information. The proposed method was first validated by a numerical experiment and then applied to field data. It was found that the tensor results obtained by this new method with cross-hole slug tests are consistent with that obtained by applying the classical Papadopulos' method with cross-hole pumping tests conducted in the same wells. When applied to heterogeneous media, tensor results produced by the new method may be subject to considerable errors. This is because the results are strongly sensitive to the connectivity between measurement boreholes and the formation medium. To reduce the error level, responses from a large number of observation wells located in various directions around the source well are needed. In addition to the adopted KGS solution for confined aquifers, the proposed methodology can be applied to incorporate other analytical methods for a variety of aquifer types, as long as the characteristic relationship between the measure scale and the aquifer storativity can be established.

AB We use synoptic surveys of stream discharge, stable isotopes, and dissolved noble gases to identify the source of groundwater discharge to the Verde River in central Arizona. The Verde River more than doubles in discharge in Mormon Pocket over a 1.4 km distance that includes three discrete locations of visible spring input to the river and other diffuse groundwater inputs. A detailed study of the Verde River between Mormon Pocket and the USGS Clarkdale Gage was conducted to better constrain the location of groundwater inputs, the geochemical signature and constrain the source of groundwater input. Discharge, water quality parameters (temperature, pH, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen), stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2), noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe), and radon (Rn-222) from river water were collected. Groundwater samples from springs and wells in the area were collected and analyzed for tracers measured in the stream along with some additional analytes (major ions, strontium isotopes (Sr-87/Sr-86), carbon-14, delta C-13, and tritium). Groundwater isotopic signature is consistent with a regional groundwater source. Groundwater springs discharging to the river have a depleted stable isotopic signature indicating recharge source up to 1000 m higher than the discharge location in the Verde River and are significantly fresher than stream water. Spring water has a radiocarbon age of several thousand years and some areas have tritium less than the laboratory reporting level or low concentrations of tritium (1.5 TU). The strontium isotopes indicate groundwater interaction with tertiary volcanic rock and Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. Along the study reach with distance downstream, Verde stream water chemistry shows increased Rn-222, freshening, increased He-4, and isotopic depletion with distance downstream. We estimated total groundwater discharge by inverting a stream transport model against Rn-222 and discharge measured in the stream. The salinity, He-4, and stable isotope composition of discharging groundwater was then estimated by fitting modeled values to observed in-stream values. Estimated groundwater inflow to the stream was well within the ranges observed in springs, indicating that the main source of streamflow is deep, regional groundwater. These results show that synoptic surveys of environmental tracers in streams can be used to estimate the isotopic composition and constrain the source of groundwater discharging to streams. Our data provide direct field evidence that deep, regional groundwater discharge can be a significant source of streamflow generation in arid, topographically complex watersheds.

AB The shortage of water resources and the increasing competition among water users have highlighted the importance of the water allocation problem. Water availability is crucial for water resource allocation and changes frequently, leading to the necessity to predict available water. This paper develops a framework aimed to plan regional water allocations under different representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios using an interval parameter conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) two-stage stochastic programming model. This framework combines prediction and optimization to reflect climate change, the uncertainty of water system and the coordination between water resources allocation and risk. The feasibility and practicality of the framework are demonstrated by its application in a real-world case study in the Lower Songhua River Basin in northeast China. Comparison between the results of the developed model and actual conditions show that 11.61 x 10(8) m(3) volume of water supply can be saved after optimization, indicating that the developed model tends to allocate water in a more efficient way. The ratio of surface water to groundwater is reduced from 2:1 to 1.62:1. The proposed model has practical relevance for saving water and alleviating groundwater overexploitation. The approach is applicable to most areas with severe water shortages and groundwater overexploitation, and decision makers can determine the appropriate options for water resources allocation based on risk preferences and actual conditions.

AB Land use changes may modify ecohydrological processes in soil, altering groundwater quantity and quality in arid and semi-arid regions. The effects of land use change were well documented on flatlands, but the effect of rooting depth on groundwater recharge is poorly understood. This study is to evaluate how conversion of shallow-rooted to deep-rooted vegetation affects groundwater recharge at different landscape positions (i.e. tableland, upslope, midslope, and downslope). Two adjacent transects were selected for a paired plot design: one was covered with shallow-rooted perennial grasses and the other was planted with deep-rooted apple trees or apricot trees in 1990s. Soil cores (as deep as 13-25 m) were collected at each of the four landscape positions along the two transects for the determination of soil water contents, root distributions, and soil tritium contents. Groundwater recharge rates beneath shallow-rooted vegetation were determined from the tritium peak method, and that beneath deep-rooted vegetation were calculated by subtracting the annual soil water deficit from recharge rates beneath shallow-rooted vegetation. Results show that, there is no significant difference in groundwater recharge between the four landscape positions under shallow-rooted vegetation (p > 0.05); however, there is a substantial difference between different slope positions along the other transect (p < 0.05). Cross comparison between the two transects show that conversion from the shallow-rooted to deep-rooted vegetation resulted in a significant reduction of groundwater recharge (p < 0.05) which reduced to virtually zero when the rooting depth is deeper than 15 m. Therefore, we conclude that rooting depth is a major control of groundwater recharge. This study is the first attempt to evaluate the effect of deep-rooted vegetation in the deep unsaturated zone on groundwater recharge on hillslopes with terraces, having important implications to afforestation and to understanding ecohydrological processes in natural ecosystems.

AB Soil water infiltration can be described with the quasi-analytical Haverkamp et al. (1994) equation, defined by the hydraulic conductivity (K-s), sorptivity (S) and the beta parameter. K-s and S are commonly estimated from the transient cumulative infiltration curve, using a constant beta value. The objective of this work was to study the influence of beta on the estimation of K-s and S. The study was first performed on synthetic 1-D infiltration curves generated at different infiltration times for loam sandy, loamy and silty soils, and next extrapolated to a 3-D loam synthetic soil and on 10 infiltrations curves measured on the field with a disc infiltrometer on different types of soils. The infiltration measurements lasted between 600 and 900 s. The results showed that, while early infiltration times (i.e. 100 s) promoted good estimations for S, longer infiltrations (i.e. 1.000 s) were required to estimate accurately K-s. Only very long infiltration (i.e. 10.000 s) allowed defining the actual beta value. A similar behaviour was observed for the 3-D infiltration measurements. Except for f, significant relationships (R-2 = 0.99) were obtained between the K-s and S of the three theoretical soils and the corresponding values calculated by optimizing the three hydraulic parameters on 2.000 s 1-D infiltration curves. The large confidence interval observed in beta (between 0.3 and 2.0) resulted from the fact that beta had a small effect on the infiltration curve. A significant relationship (R-2 = 0.99) was also obtained between the K-s and S optimized from the experimental curves using a beta = 1.1 and the corresponding values obtained by simultaneous optimization of the three hydraulic parameters. These results demonstrated that S and K-s can be accurately estimated using a constant beta and that downward infiltration is not an appropriate procedure to estimate beta.

AB Natural soils and aquifers are inherently heterogenous and chemical transport through them is anomalous characterized by an early arrival followed by a persistent tail. How to describe such anomalous phenomena has been an interest and, as a result, a number of approaches have been proposed over the past few decades. Among others, the fractional advection-dispersion equation (FADE) is a model able to describe anomalous transport when the dispersion is regional rather than local as presumed in the classical advection-dispersion equation. Practical application of FADE needs numerical solutions, which is challenging because its spatial discretization gives rise to a full coefficient matrix. In this paper, we propose a Lattice Boltzmann model to solve the two-dimensional FADE. Given that the anomalous dispersion in soils and aquifers is hydrodynamic and caused by spatial variation in water velocity across the pore space and that the chemical plume spreads preferentially along the mean water-flow direction, the dispersion coefficient and the order of the fractional derivative should be both anisotropic. The anisotropies are solved by the two-relaxation time Lattice Boltzmann model using different relaxation parameters in different directions. Compared with existing numerical methods for the FADE, the proposed model has advantages that it is explicit, second-order accurate in both time and space, mass-conservative, and free of numerical dispersion; its stability is independent of dispersion coefficient. We verify the model against the analytical solution of a benchmark problem and then apply it to simulate Cl- movement in a tracer experiment conducted on an up-catchment hillslope. The results show that the FADE with backward skewness can reproduce the breakthrough curves measured from the experiment.

AB The regulating function is the least understood but probably most valuable service provided by an ecosystem. To estimate the impact of externalities on the regulating function of a wetland, we modelled the interdependence between activities that affect wetland characteristics and land utilization patterns. Nature-based solutions (NBS) can provide benefits for society, the economy and nature. The NBS solution for wetland bioremediation is proposed through a combination of ecosystem value provided by nature-based or artificial arable land. We constructed a model to simulate the dynamic spatial and temporal changes in the regulating function of a wetland to study the impact of agricultural and fishing activities on the functions and services of a wetland ecosystem. The model was used to determine the relationship between land use change, wetland range, water quality, and fish stocks. Huangqihai Lake (HQHL) is a relatively isolated lake in an area interlaced with agriculture and pasture zones. From 1973 to 2014, the "shrinkage" of the water area of HQHL approached 60%. Under the influence of humans and natural disturbances, the HQHL wetland faced enormous ecological risks, water pollution, area reduction, sharp biodiversity reduction, and fish extinction. The phosphorus (P) concentration seems to be a key factor affecting both the reed growth in the nearshore areas of the Huangqihai Lake wetland and the breeding of phytoplankton in the core lake water area. Dividing this value by the 25,821 ha of the core wetland area affected by the reclamation, the cost per unit of lost fish production is USD$166/ha/yr. After deducting the externalities of the fishery, the net sustainable income from the conversion is USD$1717/ha. The spatial distribution of nutrient load externalities varies with the use of wetlands. In terms of fishery value, the additional nutrient load associated with the conversion of wetland uses would result in a reduction of at least 8% of the maximum sustainable yield. The conversion of wetland uses resulted in the loss of nutrient buffering functions. To compensate for the farmland's nutrient load buffer service, the government should provide arable land farmers USD$8.1 M/yr. It is theoretically feasible to implement an ecosystem service payment system that can effectively compensate for the loss of nutrient buffer function caused by the conversion of wetlands. The approach based on BNS we described may also have value in other ecosystems where regulatory functions include similar mechanisms.

AB The atmospheric water supply and demand dynamics determine a region's potential water resources. The hydrologic ratios, such as, aridity index, evaporation ratio and runoff coefficients are useful indicators to quantify the atmospheric water dynamics at watershed to regional scales. In this study, we developed a modeling framework using a machine learning approach to predict hydrologic ratios for watersheds located in contiguous United States (CONUS) by utilizing a set of climate, soil, vegetation, and topographic variables. Overall, the proposed modeling framework is able to simulate the hydrologic ratios at watershed scale with a considerable accuracy. The concept of non-parametric elasticity was applied to study the potential influence of the estimated hydrologic ratios on various drought characteristics (resilience, vulnerability, and exposure) for river basins located in CONUS. Spatial sensitivity of drought indicators to hydrologic ratios suggests that an increase in hydrologic ratios may result in augmentation of magnitude of drought indicators in majority of the river basins. Aridity index seems to have higher influence on drought characteristics in comparison to other hydrologic ratios. It was observed that the machine learning approach based on random forests algorithm can efficiently estimate the spatial distribution of hydrologic ratios provided sufficient data is available. In addition to that, the non-parametric based elasticity approach can identify the potential influence of hydrologic ratios on spatial drought characteristics.

AB Sorption is an important means for pollutant migration in aquatic environments and an important mechanism of pollutant transfer and transformation. Thus, understanding the sorption/desorption of organic pollutants in an aquatic environment is vital to predicting pollutant fate. In this study, Bisphenol A (BPA) was selected as the target pollutant for an investigation of sorption characteristics on three sediments in the Lanzhou section of the Yellow River, with examination of sorption thermodynamic parameters and the effects of temperature, pH, and sediment particle size. Sorption is described well by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, occurring at two stages, fast (0-6 h) and slow (6-16 h), with equilibrium reached within 16 h. The results suggested that the intraparticle diffusion was dominant in the sorption process. Sorption thermodynamics was nonlinear, fitting well with the Freundlich isotherm model. Physical sorption is the likely mechanism, combining the contributions of pi-pi interaction and hydrophobic interaction. Thermodynamic parameter analysis showed that Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy were less than zero, showing that it is spontaneous, exothermic, and chaos-decreasing. Among tested influence parameters, pH values, ionic strengths, temperatures, and particle sizes were found to considerably influence the sorption of BPA. Sorption capacity decreased as sediment particle size increased and as pH increased. Sorption capacity increased with increasing Ca2+ and decreased with increasing Na+. The results have important implications regarding the impact of sorption/desorption at different environmental factors and fate of BPA in Yellow River.

   PROPAGATION; VARIABILITY; SERIES
AB An empirical (geo)statistical modelling scheme is developed to address the challenges of modelling the severity and distribution of groundwater droughts given their spatially and temporally heterogeneous nature and given typically highly irregular groundwater level observations in space and time. The scheme is tested using GWL measurements from 948 observation boreholes across the Chalk aquifer (UK) to estimate monthly groundwater drought status from 1960 to 2013. For each borehole, monthly GWLs are simulated using empirical mixed models where the fixed effects are based on applying an impulse response function to the local monthly precipitation. Modelled GWLs are standardised using the Standardised Groundwater Index (SGI) and the monthly SGI values interpolated across the aquifer to produce spatially distributed monthly maps of SGI drought status for 54 years for the Chalk. The mixed models include fewer parameters than comparable lumped parameter groundwater models while explaining a similar proportion (more than 65%) of GWL variation. In addition, the empirical modelling approach enables confidence bounds on the predicted GWLs and SGI values to be estimated without the need for prior information about catchment or aquifer parameters. The results of the modelling scheme are illustrated for three major episodes of multi-annual drought (1975-1976; 1988-1992; 2011-2012). They agree with previous documented analyses of the groundwater droughts while providing for the first time a systematic, spatially coherent characterisation of the events. The scheme is amenable to use in near real time to provide short term forecasts of groundwater drought status if suitable forecasts of the driving meteorology are available.

AB Changes in hydrological processes in large watersheds may heavily impact the dynamics of downstream aquatic ecosystems such as lakes and reservoirs. In general, simple approaches that neglect the spatial heterogeneity of watersheds impede understanding of the many processes occurring in these downstream aquatic ecosystems. In most cases, observed river discharges are used as the boundary condition for lake/reservoir modeling, which limits analyses of different situations and of areas that are ungauged or water bodies with little data available. Therefore, coupling hydrological models with hydrodynamic models seems to be a promising approach to allow one to understand how catchment features (e.g., land use, topography) and river discharges impact the dynamic patterns, including local circulation patterns, water levels and water quality in large water bodies in response to basin-wide forcing factors. In this study, we used a complex, spatially explicit, integrated approach to assess the hydrological responses to external forcing factors such as wind and river discharges, in the hydrodynamics of a large shallow subtropical lake. A large-scale integrated system composed of several sub-watersheds and a lake was analyzed by coupling a large-scale hydrological model with a hydrodynamic model. Our findings indicated that (i) the integrated model improved the capacity for representing the spatial and temporal variability of lake water-surface levels; (ii) the main hydrodynamic processes (water levels and flow structure) are controlled on a seasonal scale (months) by the river discharges, and on a short time scale (days) by wind influence (intensity and direction); and (iii) the modeling strategy allowed evaluation of anthropogenic stressors such as irrigation withdrawals on lake levels. This approach is an attempt to develop a physically based management model to simulate complex systems as a whole, allowing one to understand the main factors controlling the hydrodynamic processes and water levels, and accounting for internal (e.g., recirculation, horizontal mixing) and external factors (e.g., anthropogenic stressors, irrigation).

AB A probabilistic approach is presented to assess the performance validity of the empirical Curve Number (CN) and physically-based Green and Ampt (G&A) rainfall-runoff methods in the SWAT model. Specifically, the effects of modeling uncertainties on characterization of the hydrologic budgets and streamflow regimes at various spatial scales and upstream land use conditions are investigated. A Bayesian total uncertainty assessment framework, which explicitly accounts for uncertainties from model parameters, inputs, structure, and measurement data, was employed to explore uncertainties in streamflow simulation using SWAT with different rainfall-runoff methods in a mixed-land use watershed. While the models were trained for streamflow estimation only at the watershed outlet, the performances of the models were compared at different stream locations within the watershed. At the watershed outlet, the CN method had a slightly better, but not significant, performance in terms of streamflow error statistics. Similar results were obtained for the predominantly forested and agricultural tributaries. However, in tributaries with higher percentage of developed land, G&A outperformed the CN method in simulating streamflow based on various performance metrics. In general, the 95% prediction intervals from the models with G&A method covered a higher percentage of observed streamflow especially during the high flow events. However, they were approximately 20-45% wider than the corresponding 95% prediction intervals from the CN methods. Using 95% prediction interval for estimated flow duration curves, results indicated that the models with CN methods underestimated high flow events especially in tributaries with highly developed land use. However, the CN methods generated higher water yields to streams than the G&A method. The results of this study have important implications for the selection and application of appropriate rainfall-runoff methods within complex distributed hydrologic models particularly when simulating hydrologic responses in mixed-land use watersheds. In the present study, while CN and G&A methods in the SWAT model performed similarly at the outlet of a mixed-land use watershed, G&A captured the internal processes more realistically. The subsequent effects on the representation of internal hydrological processes and budgets are discussed.

AB In predicting how droughts and hydrological cycles might change in a changing climate, change of pan evaporation (E-pan) is one crucial element to be understood. The derived partial differential (PD) form of the PenPan equation is a prevailing attribution approach worldwide. However, small biases exist and the application of PD method is limited within the derivation of partial differential form of the equation, which impede the attribution analysis in hydrology. Here we designed a series of numerical experiments by detrending each climatic variable, i.e., an experimental detrending (ED) approach, to attribute changes of E-pan over China. We compared the attribution results using these two methods and further analyzed the plausible advantages of ED approach. The comparison shows that both ED approach and PD method perform well in attributing changes of E-pan and to the input meteorological variables in China over 1960-2017. The first advantage of ED approach is that it can help make robust adjustment for the PD method in attribution analysis. Another advantage lies in its ability to attribute to the observed meteorological variables in China, when the PD method fails to quantify the contribution of relative humidity and air temperature in net radiation in E-pan attribution analysis. We highlight that the ED approach is recommended in attribution analysis for hydrologic research. Together with the adjusted PD method, both methods can assist a better understanding and prediction of water-energy cycles change in a changing climate.

AB Water quality networks usually do not include observations on a continuous timescale over a long period. Statistical models that use streamflow and mechanistic models that use meteorological information and land-use are commonly employed to develop continuous streamflow and nutrient records. Given the availability of long meteorological records, mechanistic models have the potential to develop continuous water quality records, but such predictions suffer from systematic biases on both streamflow and water quality constituents. This study proposes a multivariate bias correction technique based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) - a dimension reduction technique based on multivariate multiple regression - that reduces the bias in both streamflow and loadings simultaneously by preserving the cross-correlation. We compare the performance of CCA with linear regression (LR) in removing the systematic bias from the SWAT model forced with precipitation and temperature for three selected watersheds from the Southeastern US. First, we compare the performance of CCA with LR in removing the bias in SWAT model outputs in predicting the observed streamflow and total nitrogen (TN) loadings from the Water Quality Network (WQN) dataset. We also evaluate the potential of CCA in removing the bias in SWAT model predictions at daily and monthly time scales by considering the LOADEST model predicted loadings as the predictand for CCA and LR. Evaluation of CCA with the observed dataset and at daily and streamflow time scales shows that the proposed multivariate technique not only reduces the bias in the cross-correlation between streamflow and loadings, but also improves the joint probability of estimating observed streamflow and loadings. Potential implications of the proposed bias-correction technique, CCA, in water quality forecasting and management are also discussed.

AB This study establishes an innovative systematic optimization model for megacity flood mitigation by combining multiple Low Impact Development (LID) devices, taking into consideration a Benefit-Cost (B/C) Analysis. The contributions provided by this study include: (1) analysis of flooding consequences on a developing megacity; (2) development of a technical approach enabling an automatic and effective optimization process, linking with an embedded Storm Water Management Model (SWMM); and (3) proposal of adaptive solutions using a combined layout design scheme. Our investigation sets the Benefit/Cost ratio as the objective function to deal with flooding in all return periods (RPs). The decision variables correspond to the allocated areas and quantity of LID devices, including porous pavements, bioretention cells, infiltration trenches, rain barrels, vegetable swales, green roofs, and tree boxes. Under such layout, the flooding loss was simulated with SWMM, and the optimal solution was solved by employing a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm. Min-Sheng Community in Taipei is chosen as a study area for demonstrating the applicability of the developed model. Results show that the B/C ratio of identified optimal design can reach 1.448, with green roofs and bioretention cells as main devices, and rain barrels and porous pavements as secondary supplies. Regarding rainfalls in all RPs, the peak flows and delay of peak times at Fu-Yuan Pumping Station can decrease significantly in the range of 5.75-29.80% and 12.50-20%, respectively; and 9.52%-23.49% and 12.50%-37.5% at the subcatchments. The efficiency of flood detention is higher for low RPs than high RPs, while the time-delay ability is smaller.

AB Droughts cause significant socio-economic and environmental impacts, so it has become an extremely important element in decision-making within water resource systems. For this reason, the research in this field has increased considerably over the last few decades. In order to be capable of making early decisions and reducing drought impacts, it is necessary to predict the occurrence of such events months or even years in advance. In this sense, various methods have been used to predict the occurrence of droughts. At present, seasonal forecast data can be used to forecast meteorological, hydrological, agricultural and operational droughts. However, the seasonal forecast data of these dynamical ocean-atmosphere coupled models must be analyzed in an exhaustive way, since it is known that these models may not adequately represent the climatic variability at river basin scale. Hence, this paper presents a new methodology for assessing the skill of a climate forecasting system in order to predict the occurrence of droughts by using contingency tables. The indices obtained from the contingency tables are necessary to perform the analysis of the predictive ability of the model in a semi-distributed way. All this taking into account the intensity of droughts using different scenarios based on the threshold below which it is considered to be in drought. Finally, a single value is obtained to determine the predictive ability of the forecasting model for the entire basin. The proposed methodology is applied to the Jucar river basin in Spain. It has been found that the analyzed forecast model shows better results than those obtained using an autoregressive model. Further work is needed to enhance climate forecasting from the perspective of water resources management, however, it should be mentioned that this type of data could be used for drought forecasting, allowing possible mitigation measures.

   concentration data
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English

AB For large contaminant plumes in groundwater, Pump and Treat (PT) is usually applied, not only to remediate the aquifer, but also to control the spreading of the plume. The aquifer structure, as well as the spatial distribution of the contaminant plume, are typically subject to uncertainty. This uncertainty can highly effect the remediation predictions. Geostatistical tools combined with Monte-Carlo simulations can be used to quantify those uncertainties and to provide a more established basis for decision makers regarding the remediation strategy. Here, we focus on a case study of a polluted aquifer and inspect its response to remediation by a PT scheme using two pumping wells. The aquifer structure is combined of 4 lithological units and indicator realizations were generated using a modified sequential indicator simulation (SIS) approach. Then, the initial plume prior to remediation was estimated by a forward predictive model. As a result, each realization had a unique spatial distribution of the contaminant at the onset of the remediation. Spatio-temporal measurements of head and contaminant concentration were used to screen inappropriate realizations. Our results have shown that conditioning the realizations to the head alone has a minor effect upon the uncertainty regarding the remediation efficiency (RE). On the other hand, by conditioning the realizations to both head and concentrations, the uncertainty was reduced by more than 35% in terms of the standard deviation of RE.
   Risk analysis for the migration of the plume showed that the ability of the current configuration of the remediation wells to control the plume is limited to the top layers of the aquifer. Thus, with the present monitoring network, there is a significant risk that the plume will migrate downstream towards production wells, without being noticed.

AB Multiple optima seriously confine the solution accuracy of stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) for non-concave maximization models of reservoir operation. To address the problem, a two-stage optimization algorithm combining traversing and search is proposed to obtain an optimal decision at each state combination. Single or multiple promising regions where a local optimal solution may exist are identified through coarse traversing in the whole feasible region, and a local search algorithm is used to local optimization in each promising region. Energy maximization model is used to analyze the multiple optima problem and test the method. In the model, quadratic and concave penalty functions are used to address the total power constraint for smaller shortages and fewer shortage periods respectively. The total power constraint increases the probability of multiple local optima existence and intensifies the difficulty in finding optimal decisions. The proposed model and method are applied to the cascaded reservoir system on middle-lower Lancang River in China. Numerical results show that the total power constraint is well addressed, the computing time can be reduced by more than 50% using the two-stage algorithm in getting operating rules with similar performance comparing to only traversing, and the multi-point search algorithm is superior to traversing and single point search in solving the proposed model.

DE Discharge measurement; Streamgauging; Rating curves; Rivers; Velocity

AB Traditional methods for the calculation of rating curves from measurements of water level and discharge are criticised as being limited and complicated to implement, such that manual methods are still often used. Two methods for automatic computation are developed using least-squares approximation, one based on polynomials and the other on piecewise-continuous splines. Computational problems are investigated and procedures recommended to overcome them. Both methods are found to work well and once the parameters for a gauging station have been determined, rating data can be processed automatically. For some streams, ephemeral changes of resistance may be important, evidenced by scattered or loopy data. For such cases, the approximation methods can be used to generate a rating envelope as well, allowing the routine calculation also of maximum and minimum expected flows. Criticism is made of current shift curve practices. Finally, the approximation methods allow the specification of weights for the data points, enabling the filtering of data, especially decreasing the importance of points with age and allowing the computation of a rating curve for any time in the past or present.

AB Due to the significant costs associated with stream health monitoring, hydrological modeling is widely used to calculate ecologically-relevant hydrologic indices to better understand the overall condition of streams within large and diverse watersheds. However, hydrologic modeling's ability to replicate these indices is limited, especially when calibrating models by optimizing a single objective function or when selecting a single optimal solution. Hence, this study evaluates the performance of multi-objective model calibration in representing 167 hydrologic indices of ecological interest using the median values of different Pareto-optimal solution sets. For this purpose, two strategies based on three Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiencies (NSE), and root-mean-squared error (RMSE) with explicit hydrograph partitioning, were implemented. Additionally, the k-means clustering technique was employed to define subsets of Pareto-optimal solutions representing high, medium, and low flow conditions. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was set up for the Honeyoey Creek-Pine Creek Watershed, located in Michigan, USA, and was calibrated using a single streamflow gauging station and the recently proposed multi-objective optimization algorithm - Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III). The results show that the NSE- and RMSE-based calibration strategies can represent 128 and 123 indices within a range of +/- 30% relative errors, respectively. In addition, the results of this study demonstrated that using different set of solutions, instead of a single optimal solution, introduces more flexibility in the predictability of different hydrologic indices of ecological interest. Moreover, it is suggested that a multi-objective calibration approach allows the systematic identification of groups of poorly represented and closely related indices. Knowing these poorly represented indices would facilitate the formulation of additional objective functions intended to improve model performance or to detect structural inadequacies.

DE Riverbed; Resuspension; Dams; Loss of river deltas
ID SUSPENDED SEDIMENT; MODEL
AB Consideration is given to a novel approach for resuspension and control of sediment in reservoirs which nowadays and after more than six decades of research remains as the most serious technical problem faced by dam industry. Here, it is proposed the generation of mild surface waves in the reservoir which - because the physical nature of the waves, will spread throughout the reservoir. Then, by using a farm of point absorbers - or technology akin as used in ocean energy conversion, the energy transported by the waves can be transformed into a continuous injection of water flow in the riverbeds balancing the gravitational settling and then in the resuspension and control of sediment settlement. Utilizing a simplified physical model an estimation of the area of riverbed covered in comparison with the area of point absorber needed was derived as function of several parameters. Methods for wave generation were briefly discussed and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFDs) simulations performed being in good agreement with the theoretical estimations. The proposed concept is presented as a promising alternative technique which can contribute to mitigate the serious global problem of land loss in the river deltas as well as increasing the storable capability and life of large dams.

AB Coastal bays with fresh submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) have been found to provide a favorable environment to shellfish (e.g., oysters). Significant variability in the spatial distribution and magnitude of SGD may occur because of subsurface heterogeneity. We investigated the relationship between stratigraphic controls (i.e. paleovalley systems) and the spatial distribution of SGD in relation to oyster reefs. In Copano Bay, South Texas, major oyster reefs have been shown to be oriented perpendicular to shore, along interfluves, and near paleovalley margins. A novel combination approach of radioactive geochemical tracers, stable isotopes, geophysical and petrophysical techniques were used to identify estuarine depositional environments for individual hydrogeologic characterization and evaluation of SGD distribution with implications to ecological features such as oyster reefs. A 1-km(2) area within a paleovalley system, in Copano Bay, yielded discernible differences in sediment type, apparent resistivity, and SGD rates among four different depositional environments: paleovalley, paleovalley margin, oyster reef and interfiuve. Electrical resistivity tomography revealed a direct connection between the oyster reef and the underlying, more permeable interfiuve, and the presence of a fresher SGD component in the subsurface. Measurements of SGD from stationary and mobile continuous radon-222 surveys across each depositional environment showed that, by and large, areas in proximity to reefs have larger SGD rates (62.6 +/- 11.3 cm/d in January and 28.7 +/- 10.8 cm/d in July) when compared to paleovalleys (31.9 +/- 8.9 cm/d in January and 19.5 +/- 7.2 cm/d in July). The role of depositional environments as hydrologic controls on SGD to oyster reefs revealed in this study is further confirmed by significant differences in stable and radioactive isotopes observed over small spatial scales offshore when compared to the entire estuary. Although constant mixing and radon-222 degassing of bay waters are likely altering the relationships between the different depositional environments and magnitude of SGD, this study provides an improved understanding of possible pathways of freshwater and solute inputs to oyster reefs for more informed decisions on reef restoration efforts.

AB Despite increasing knowledge on the spatio-temporal dynamics of river temperature, a master water quality variable, it remains a challenge to identify the landscape variables influencing thermal heterogeneity along entire river courses. The present study investigated the spatial heterogeneity of stream temperature (ST), and the role of landscape variables, at 20 locations along the 195 km course of the intensively managed lowland River Spree (NE Germany) over a period of nine months. Along the river, four distinct thermal sections were identified, created by thermal discontinuities induced by lakes and an urban area. Three approaches, namely heat budget modelling (estimating the unresolved residual heat flux), both in Eulerian and Lagrangian form, semi-empirical air2stream modelling, and statistical correlations were applied to quantify the observed thermal heterogeneity and the role of climatic (air temperature) and landscape variables (land use, lakes, stream azimuth). Urban areas and lakes were identified as heat sources (in summer), which induced ST discontinuities at different time scales (daily, monthly and during the entire study period). Statistical correlations showed that heat inputs and ST increased with increasing urban area and decreased with distance from lakes. Furthermore, comparison of observed STs and those simulated via the Lagrangian model revealed that heat advection was the dominant thermal process in a lake-influenced section and persisted over a distance of up to 20 km. Simulations showed that this effect could not be significantly diminished even by complete riparian shading along the section, as the sub-daily ST reduced by an average of only 1.5 degrees C. Hence, plantation of riparian buffers should be complemented with additional mitigation measures such as improving the groundwater table recharge, managing the temperature of urban discharges, to mitigate climate change impacts on ST.

AB In this study, we aim to characterise natural variability of water temperature in surface waters of the Tatra Mts. and determine the dominant factors controlling its spatial diversity and seasonal patterns. For this purpose, a total of 33 time series of water temperature representing lakes, vaucluse springs and streams were analysed using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). The periodicity analysis were conducted with the Morlet wavelet on hourly sampled data covering a period of 5 years. The principal components analysis (PCA) has been applied to describe the relationships among variables and extract potential sources of water temperature variability. The results showed an extremely high heterogeneity in temporal patterns of water temperature fluctuations among streams when compared to lakes and vaucluse springs. Wavelet analysis of water temperature time series revealed the presence of seven different configurations of periodical patterns. The lowest variability was observed among vaucluse springs that are supplied by groundwaters. Temporal fluctuations of water temperature in lakes contained four different types of oscillations. Streams were among the most diversified in terms of water temperature patterns exhibiting low, medium and high frequency behaviour. The PCA analysis confirmed the dependence of water temperature on weather conditions, catchment characteristics and flow rate explaining 88.97% of the total variability in the data. The results obtained from this study emphasize the importance of continuous data collection for capturing the long-term dynamics and consistent temporal patterns in time series. The study also demonstrates that wavelet analysis is helpful to identify cyclical patterns in time series of water temperature, and therefore may be useful in the classification of thermal regimes in surface waters.

AB The groundwater contribution to streamflow along a lowland alluvial stream in Denmark was estimated using a variety of methods and at different spatial scales. At the point-scale (less than a few metres), groundwater discharge to the stream was measured using seepage meters. At the reach-scale (0.5-1.5 km), groundwater discharge to the stream was estimated using differential streamflow gauging. And at the catchment-scale ( > 1.5 km), groundwater discharge to the stream was estimated using hydrograph separation. The estimates of groundwater discharge obtained using point-scale measurements range from 12 to 41 cm/d which is lower than fluxes estimated at the reach-scale which range from 18 to 333 cm/d. This discrepancy was attributed to the partitioning of groundwater discharge into streambed seepage and bank seepage. On the other hand, the groundwater discharge estimates obtained using hydrograph separation were generally the highest and ranged from 194 to 289 cm/d. For this study, this discrepancy from the reach-scale estimates was attributed to the assumption that baseflow obtained using hydrograph separation represents groundwater discharge to the stream when part of the baseflow actually comes from artificial drainage systems. Anyhow, seepage meter measurements, differential streamflow gauging, and hydrograph separation showed similar trends. The increase in streamflow is mainly due to either groundwater discharge through the streambed and the banks in the lower part, or tile drainage discharge in the upper part of the catchment. Furthermore, estimation of uncertainty for the various groundwater discharge estimates showed that some of the flux estimates were insignificant compared with their propagated uncertainties. To this end, a novel method was developed to estimate the uncertainty of groundwater discharge estimates obtained by hydrograph separation. Overall, this paper shows that more than one method should be used to obtain a reliable estimate of groundwater discharge to a lowland alluvial stream from other discharge contributions such as tile drainage.

AB We used data from 109 surveyed cross sections at 34 reaches of New Zealand rivers ranging in bankfull width from 8 to 234 m, each with 4-13 measured flows, to compare regression-derived at-a-station hydraulic geometry (AHG) coefficients and exponents to the coefficients and exponents predicted by Dingman's (2007) analytical AHG relations. The analytical geometrical relations depend on measured values of 1) bankfull width, 2) bankfull maximum depth, and 3) a geometric exponent fit to the measured cross section. Because of data limitations and the lack of a generally applicable analytical hydraulic relation, the hydraulic relation is here represented by an empirical power-law relation between depth and velocity developed at each section. The fits between the quasi-analytical and empirical values of the AHG coefficients and exponents are highly statistically significant, with intercepts near 0 and slopes near 1, validating Dingman's original analytical relations. This confirmation of the physical basis underlying empirically-observed AHG relations, along with some statistically-significant relations among the quantities that determine AHG coefficients and exponents that are not predicted by theory, may be useful for estimating AHG relations from remotely-sensed or partial information.

ID REPRESENTATION
AB Due to the dynamic flow exchange between a stream and a connected water- table aquifer, a physically based hydrologic model is an important tool for the design of conjunctive use of surface and ground waters. It is needed to develop sound plans for sustainable use of the groundwater with minimal undesirable effects. This article reports an investigation of the component (module) that describes the stream-aquifer flow exchange in several groundwater simulators. The study indicates that the module may not have a solid physical basis when used in large-scale regional studies to estimate the stream-aquifer flow exchange. The component relies upon an empirical parameter known as the leakance coefficient. It is demonstrated that neglecting river penetration of the aquifer can lead to non-negligible errors in estimation of seepage. In addition the leakance coefficient (dimension inverse of a time) is not constant in time but varies with the conditions in the river and in the surrounding aquifer. A potential, practical and simple alternative is presented.

DE Evaporation; Lysimeters; Sand dams; Bare soil
AB Unlike evaporation from open water, the magnitude of evaporation from bare soil decreases as the water table falls. Bare soil evaporation studies have included field and laboratory experiments, mathematical formulations and semi-empirical models. However, there is only limited field information, especially concerning evaporation from bare sand. The semi-empirical approach of the FAO(1) Irrigation and Drainage Paper 56, which contains guidelines for computing crop water requirements, can be adapted for bare soil evaporation with a three stage process. The suitability of the FAO 56 approach for bare sand evaporation is investigated by installing lysimeters in sand dams. Sand dams are shallow groundwater storage systems, which are designed on the assumption of reduced evaporation as the water table falls. The field results from the lysimeters are simulated adequately by a water balance model based on FAO 56 with an additional component to represent both the difference between the variable saturation with depth, which occurs in practice, and the assumption in standard water balance models of a sudden change from dry to fully-saturated conditions at the water table. This study demonstrates and quantifies the reduction in bare soil evaporation compared to open water or cropped areas and confirms the validity of the three stage FAO semi-empirical approach.

TI Runoff, flood peaks and proportional response in a combined nested and

AB In an unusual combined nested and paired catchment experiment in northern England, the 1.5-km(2) Coalbum catchment (90% mature plantation forest with a dense drainage ditch network) is paired with the 1.4-km(2) Flothers catchment (64% peat grassland), both being nested within the 6.9-km(2) Throssburn mixed forest and peat grassland catchment. In only the second such UK quantification, a 100% forest cover reduces annual runoff relative to a 100% grassland cover by 24%. The study provides rare field (as opposed to model) evidence showing that the impact of land use on flood peaks is moderated by catchment saturation and by extreme rainfall. Flood frequency curves differ according to land use at the smaller return periods but the data are not sufficient to confirm that the pattern extends to the highest floods. Against conventional expectation, flood peaks tend to be larger and flashier in the forest catchment, apparently the consequence of the forest ditching. Springtime monthly runoff/rainfall ratios in the peat grassland catchment may reach 100%, representing a seasonal sponge effect which is eliminated from the forest catchment through the effects of the ditches. Combination of the paired and nested catchments provides a highly unusual opportunity to show that, at the annual scale, the integrated catchment response can be obtained by combining the responses of the separate land covers according to the proportions of the catchment that they occupy, an assumption widely made but rarely, if ever, tested.

AB In this reply we further demonstrate and confirm that the main conclusion (namely, that the asymptotic limit of the acid dissolution capacity can lead to sharp dissolution fronts) in our recent publication in this journal is correct and valid. The basis of the incorrect critique in the comment is whether or not a physically-consistent velocity scale should be used in deriving the dimensionless partial differential equations of the reactive infiltration instability problem in fluid-saturated rocks. In addition, there is confusion in the comment between the conclusions drawn from results obtained using different time scales (such as a dissolution time scale and a much larger time scale than the dissolution time scale) in the process of describing the reactive infiltration instability problem, and using different mathematical transforms (such as a physically-consistent mathematical transform and a physically-inconsistent one) in the nondimensionalization of dimensional partial differential equations.

AB Physically based distributed hydrological models are useful for simulating the spatial distribution of hydrologic fluxes across the catchment under various climate and land cover change scenarios. However, complexities associated with their implementation at large scales make their applications limited. Previously, an equivalent cross-section (ECS) based distributed hydrological modelling approach was developed for first order sub-basins to reduce the computational time/effort. Here, the ECS approach is modified for semi-distributed hydrological modelling at the catchment scale. The modelling approach is implemented for a 314 km(2) McLaughlin catchment located in south-eastern New South Wales (NSW), Australia that consists of 822 first order sub-basins. A 26 year long streamflow record simulated using an ECS based modelling approach are compared against daily observed streamflow and four calibrated lumped conceptual hydrologic models, and found to be consistent. Further, the simulated actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture from the ECS approach are compared against the Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) model simulations and results found to be consistent. In addition, the temporal dynamics of simulated soil moisture from the ECS approach is consistent with the satellite derived European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) surface soil moisture data. In the ECS based semi-distributed modelling, all parameters are derived from the actual topographic and physiographic information of the catchment and none of the parameters is calibrated. Therefore, this approach has the advantage of simulating streamflow in ungauged catchments compared to lumped conceptual models. The impact of spatially distributed climatic forcing and land cover on soil moisture is investigated across four landforms (upslope, midslope, footslope and alluvial-flats) and at various soil depths. Our results show increase of mean soil moisture in shallow layers of upslope toward alluvial-flats. However, mean soil moisture in deeper horizons remained almost constant across all landforms. The variability of daily soil moisture at surface soil layers is higher than the deeper soil layers for all landforms. Our results illustrated that disaggregation of a catchment to a series of ECS at the scale of first order sub-basins, captures dynamics of soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration across the landscape and results are consistent with the climatology, land cover type, topography and soil hydraulic properties. Further, the use of ECS approach in the McLaughlin catchment reduced the number of computational units by 40 times in comparison to 3-d grid based distributed modelling setup.

AB The optimization of the mixed reservoir system, consisting of parallel and cascade reservoirs, is a complex issue due to its nonlinear storage curves, complex hydraulic connection and coordination. This paper aims to derive optimal operating rules for the flood control of large-scale mixed reservoir using a new algorithm known as weighted non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (WNSGA II), which could efficiently locate the Pareto front in the non-dominated region due to directed searching with the weighted crowding distance. A case study was performed in the Xijiang river basin in China, where there are eight flood control reservoirs and five flood control sections in four tributaries and the mainstream. Three scenarios, including conventional operating rules (COR), single-objective piecewise linear operating rules derived by genetic algorithm (PLO-GA), and multi-objective piecewise linear operating rules derived by WNSGA II (PLO-WNSGA II), are compared, and the resilience of three reservoir operating rules under inflow uncertainty is investigated as well. The results indicate that: (1) WNSGA II can locate non-dominated solutions more efficiently and provide better Pareto front than non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) due to the weighted crowding distance; (2) PLO-WNSGA II outperforms COR and PLO-GA for the control of basin-wide floods; and (3) PLO-WNSGA II is more resilient under inflow uncertainty. Therefore, PLO-WNSGA II is effective and efficient for the control of basin-wide floods in a mixed reservoir system.

AB The understanding of the impact of drought on the agricultural ecosystem is key to minimize drought-related yield losses. In this study, we analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought events in the North China Plain (NCP) based on the Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and investigated the impact of drought on winter wheat and summer maize yields. The results indicate an overall drought and wetting trend during the winter wheat growing season in the Henan and Shandong provinces, respectively. A significant wetting trend was detected in the NCP during the summer maize growing season at the 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month scales. Moreover, the drought episodes clearly reveal that the drought pattern has changed from summer and autumn droughts in the 1980s, to autumn and winter droughts in the 1990s, and to winter and spring droughts in the recent decade. Our results also show that the annual variations in the detrended SPEI can explain extensive fluctuations associated with both winter wheat and summer maize yields in the NCP. Furthermore, considerable differences in the relationship between agricultural crop yields and the SPEI time series with different lags were observed; the most correlated time scale increases with the advancement of the winter wheat growth stage. The correlations between the winter wheat standardized yield residuals series (SYRS) and detrended SPEI in three subperiods are consistently high and stable, whereas a substantial decrease of the correlation was observed at all time scales for summer maize, except for the 1-month lag. Our findings can help to better understand the drought evolution in the NCP in recent decades and hence provide stakeholders with references for the design of future drought mitigation plans.

ID RADIATION CYCLE; PRECIPITATION; IMPACT; OSCILLATION; SEASONALITY;

AB We analyze the diurnal cycle of maximum rainfall from similar to 300 TCs from March 2014 through February 2017, by cross-referencing the path of tropical cyclones (TCs) and high-resolution rainfall estimates from IMERG (Integrated Multi-satellitE Rainfall from GPM - Global Precipitation Measurement mission). IMERG is a gridded satellite product that offers high-resolution rainfall estimates at a spatiotemporal resolution of 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees every 30 min, which are particularly suitable for these analyses.
   Because of the nature of the data, we use circular statistics. Circular statistics allows us to account for the natural periodicity of a random variable such as the time of the day at which maximum rainfall from TCs occurs. We follow the non-parametric approach of Mixtures of Von Mises-Fisher distribution (MvMF), which enables an easy-to-interpret parameter identification of multimodal and anisotropic distributions of the TC-rainfall. We stratify our analysis by storm duration, maturity, and intensity, basin of origin, radial proximity to the center of the storm, and whether the storm is over the ocean or land.
   In general, and across all scales, we find that there are mainly two cycles of maximum TC-rainfall: one diurnal cycle with peaks at similar to 10 and similar to 22 h (local time), and one semi-diurnal cycle with peaks at similar to 2 and similar to 5 h (local time). Although in a smaller proportion, the latter exhibits a weak afternoon alternative, i.e., similar to 14 and similar to 18 h (local time).

AB The carbon and water cycles play an important role in ecosystem functioning and are linked to each other through different physical and biological processes. The hydroclimatic disturbances such as droughts affect both hydrological as well as the ecological processes. Increasing hydroclimatic disturbances under climate change will adversely affect the ecohydrological processes and hence, the assessment of the ecohydrological resilience and its controlling factors is important for the sustainability of the ecosystems. In this study, an assessment of the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems in India to hydroclimatic disturbances was carried out at the district (i.e. administrative division) scale. Ecosystem water use efficiency (WUEe), defined as the ratio of net primary productivity (NPP) to evapotranspiration, was used as an indicator of ecosystem functioning or its response to hydroclimatic disturbances. We found a large spatial variation in WUEe in India at district scale, which was significantly higher in lower Himalayan regions compared to rest of the country. Increasing trend in WUEe was found for central parts of the country. The resilience was measured in terms of the ratio of the WUEe under the dry conditions and the mean WUEe which indicates the ability to absorb hydroclimatic disturbance. Out of 634 districts considered for this study, only 241 (similar to 38%) districts were found resilient to dry conditions, whereas a significant reduction in WUEe was observed for some of the districts. The resilience at district scale indicates the cross-biomes response of ecosystems. In general, the forest dominated districts had higher resilience compared to districts dominated by other biome types. Also, districts having temperate climate were found having higher resilience. Out of 30 states and union territories (UTs) only 10 states had more than 50% resilient area. The results of this study highlight the need for better ecosystem management policies in the country.

AB To better understand the groundwater flow and chemistry in argillaceous formations, the dependency of transport parameters such as permeability, diffusion coefficient, and chemical osmotic efficiency on each of the chemical species dominant in groundwater must also be understood. Despite its importance, however, little is known about the dependence of transport parameters on different types of groundwater. Thus, we investigated transport parameters of Wakkanai mudstones using three different types of electrolyte solutions. Here, we report the relationship among the solution salt type, solute concentration, transport parameters, and pore structure characteristics. Wide ranges in osmotic efficiency and intrinsic permeability, 0.0035-0.14 and 1.19 x 10(-19) to 4.75 x 10(-18) m(2), respectively, reflect the difference in the solution composition based on the salt type, difference in solute concentration, and variation in the pore size distributions of Wakkanai mudstones. The effective diffusion coefficients with filtration effects, at 2.98 x 10(-11) to 5.92 x 10(-11) m(2) s(-1), vary depending on salt type, but remain invariant among samples, indicating no difference in fluid flow path associated with small values of osmotic efficiency. In contrast, the osmotic efficiencies are related to differences in salt concentrations. Our findings indicate that salt concentration and pore structure characteristics determine not only the semipermeability of the Wakkanai mudstones but also the diffusivity and permeability.

AB Contaminant source identification is a key problem in handling groundwater pollution events. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is used for the spatiotemporal identification of a point contaminant source in a sandbox experiment, together with the identification of the position and length of a vertical plate inserted in the sandbox that modifies the geometry of the system. For the identification of the different parameters, observations in time of solute concentration are used, but not of piezometric head data since they were not available. A restart version of the EnKF is utilized because it is necessary to restart the forecast from time zero after each parameter update. The results show that the restart EnKF is capable of identifying both contaminant source information and aquifer-geometry-related parameters together with an uncertainty estimate of such identification.

AB Colloidal-suspension flows in porous media occur in numerous areas of environmental, chemical and petroleum engineering. The main processes are capture and detachment of particles, yielding permeability decline. We developed a governing system of transport equations with particle detachment kinetics, where the detachment by high velocities is instant, due to flow incompressibility, and the detachment by decreasing the fluid salinity is delayed, due to micro-scale diffusion. The system allows for a semi-analytical solution for axi-symmetric low-salinity water injection with fines migration. The model exhibits instant fines mobilization at the beginning of injection by drag force, fines release with delay behind the salinity front by electrostatic force, and the interaction of two concentration waves. The model can be used for laboratory-based injectivity decline prediction during injection of water in aquifers and oilfields, where the injected and formation water compositions are different, and also for fines-migration during drilling fluid invasion.

AB An efficient method for nonlinear approximate solutions of the one-dimensional horizontal absorption equation is presented. The method pertains to a semi-infinite soil with uniform initial condition and constant soil water content at the beginning of a soil column. It does not make any prior assumptions about the form of the diffusivity function. The nonlinear solution is of simple combination of power and exponential functions and expresses in explicit form the distance as function of time and soil water content. It involves all the physical parameters and four additional fitting parameters which can be obtained by simple fitting procedure. Algebraic expressions that quantify the main infiltration process are derived from the basic equation. These include the sorptivity, the infiltration rate, the cumulative infiltration rate, and the wetting front. A comparison with exact, numerical and other analytical solutions validates the accuracy of the approximation and shows its advantage to other approximate solutions. The analytical expressions are used to predict experimental soil moisture profiles from simple measurements such as sorptivity, wetting front, and initial and final soil water contents. The method is applied to estimate soil hydraulic properties using horizontal water absorption experiments. The results of the parameter estimation procedure are compared to other existing results and show good agreements. The solution method is also tested to various diffusivity functions and its limitation is discussed in detail.

AB This study is an assessment of the changes in seasonal and monthly flow in seven catchments draining the northern Tien Shan Mountains in Central Asia over a period from the 1950s to the present day. The purpose is to provide a first assessment of the flow response to climate change in regionally important catchments given their contribution to the water resource. All the catchments have a natural flow regime, and are therefore sensitive to climate change, but differ in area, elevation and glacial extent. Trends in flow were characterised using the Mann-Kendall test for standard meteorological seasons and individual months for mean flow, five flow quantiles and peak-over-threshold series for the period 1974-2013 at all sites and from the 1950s where data were available. The results were related to trends in seasonal temperature and precipitation from the regional high-elevation meteorological stations and glacier mass balance, equilibrium line altitude (ELA) and accumulation area ratio (AAR) records from the Tuyuksu glacier. The results show no reduction in streamflow in any catchment or season in the northern Tien Shan since the 1950s. Positive trends in all flow indicators, including peakover-threshold frequency, were observed in catchments with higher glacierization of over 10% and extensive presence of rock glaciers and permafrost indicating increased melt over the period which is characterised by a long-term increase in temperature. These trends were most evident in autumn and winter. In catchments with low glacierization, variability in summer flow was controlled primarily by precipitation of the preceding cold season. Correlation with glacier mass balance was weak but changes in ELA and AAR indicate that production of liquid runoff at higher elevations contributes to increased streamflow partly compensating for the declining glacier area. The observed changes in streamflow do not suggest any immediate problems with water availability in the northern Tien Shan. On the contrary, increased autumn and winter flows point at a more prolonged recharge of reservoirs and aquifers though eventually this water source will be exhausted.

AB Conventional neuro-fuzzy systems used for rainfall-runoff (R-R) modelling are generally dependent on expert knowledge. In these models, not only the structure is designed by the expert user, but also all the required knowledge for fuzzy partitioning of the input-output space and rule base need to be provided by the expert. To move towards NFS with a more flexible rule base and structure, efforts are made to integrate the self-reliant mechanisms into the learning algorithm that enable the model to identify the position and distribution of fuzzy labels in input-output space and generate the required rule base. In this study, the self-adaptive fuzzy inference network (SaFIN) is used for the R-R application. SaFIN employs a new clustering technique known as Categorical Learning-Induced Partitioning (CLIP) which allows the model to adapt to the new incoming tuple by consistently updating the model. SaFIN is also equipped with a rule-pruning mechanism that can exclude inconsistent and obsolete rules. In this study, SaFIN R-R models are developed in three different catchment types and sizes where the results are compared against a benchmark NFS model and few physical models including URHM, HBV, GR4J. Results shows that SaFIN is a capable and robust tool for R-R modeling under varying catchment conditions. Moreover, SaFIN produced comparable if not superior results to the benchmark models. It was concluded that SsFIN with its self-reliant learning and rule generation mechanism equipped with rule pruning can make it a competent tool for R-R modelling in catchments where the data may contain some inconsistencies.

AB In the late 50s Michel Jouvet discovered the presence of muscle atonia during REM sleep in cats and created the first model of REM sleep behavior disorder. He built and led in Lyon, France, the "Laboratory of Molecular Dream Science" (a merry oxymoron to silently protest against the research policy of favoring molecular biology over physiology), where in the late 80s, you could cross people who had worked on sleep in the python, tench fish, tortoise, iguana, hen, lamb, mouse, rat and cat. This brilliant physiologist was also a great storyteller with a very good sense of humor. He supported the theory that dreaming is equivalent to REM sleep (which he called "paradoxical sleep"), kept his own dream diary, and imagined that the ponto-geniculo-occipital waves during REM sleep could compose the song sheet of dreams. He wrote several books published in French on dreams and dreaming. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A great pioneer in sleep research, Michel Jouvet applied rigorous scientific methods to the study of sleep-wake states and associated changes in consciousness which, with his vivid imagination and creative mind, he unveiled as the mysteries of sleep and waking such as to inspire a generation of researchers in the field. His initial discovery of a third state distinguished from waking (W) and slow wave sleep (SWS) by the paradoxical association of W-like cortical activity with sleep-like behavior and muscle atonia that he accordingly called "paradoxical sleep" (PS) began his investigation over some 50 years of the mechanisms of these three sleep-wake states. Using primarily lesion and pharmacological manipulations, he sought the systems which are necessary and sufficient, and he thereby provided an early blueprint of how the neuromodulatory systems could determine the sleep-wake states. With the application of increasingly more selective lesion and other advanced techniques including, notably, single unit recording combined with histochemical identification of recorded units, the monoamines and acetylcholine, together with peptidergic systems have been revealed to play modulatory, yet not essential, roles acting upon other intermingled glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons that are the effector neurons of the sleep-wake states and their cortical and behavioral correlates.

AB In this short review, I would like to share some personal memories about the insights and achievements of Michel Jouvet in the field of sleep ontogeny. The first time I met Michel Jouvet was in 1972 when he accepted to chair my thesis on sleep, the research work being preformed in Howard Roffwarg's lab in New York. From then on we had many discussions together about the mechanisms and nature of neonatal Paradoxical Sleep, notably its characteristic muscular "twitches". The idea emerged of a genetically programmed pattern of motor activation responsible for this state of "seismic" sleep. Such a pattern would underlie, for example, the facial mimics displayed during sleep in early life, whose function would be to "pre-practice" a specific behavior. Later on, in the 1980's Michel Jouvet had the masterful insight to extend this role of Paradoxical Sleep to the theory of genetic programming for maintaining psychological individualism. Michel Jouvet's scientific curiosity and generosity led to his exceptional accomplishments, and he will remain as an immense figure in the culture of sleep science.

AB Michel Jouvet established a tradition of sleep neurophysiology that inspired several generations of sleep researchers. When I arrived in his laboratory in 1991, it was known that erection cycles occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in humans. However, it was not known if such erections in sleep occurred in other species, or how REM-related erections were controlled. Employing the classical techniques and systematic approach of Jouvet and his team, I embarked on a journey of discovery. Not only were fundamental principles of REM-related erectile control identified, such as the critical role of the lateral preoptic area in the forebrain, but I also gained a deep appreciation of the scientific approach in the Jouvet tradition. Such insights passed on to his many students, together with a lifetime of friendships and collaborations, have left an indelible mark on our field. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This article focuses on the contributions made by Michel Jouvet concerning the systems responsible for the muscle atonia of paradoxical sleep (REM sleep). He was the first to describe the brainstem system mechanisms responsible for muscle atonia during paradoxical sleep using pontine cats and localized pontine lesions. Also discussed is the research going on in the eighties, when Michel Jouvet was hunting for the hypnogenetic factor. At that time, he thought that it was secreted by the hypophysis; but it finally turned out to be controlled by the hypocretin/orexin and melanin concentrating hormone neurones located in the lateral hypothalamus. Several unforgettable moments with Michel Jouvet are described which occurred between 1983 as well as his last moments with us. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Serotonin (5-HT) is involved in sleep in two different ways. First, when released during waking by the axonal nerve endings, it influences the synthesis of hypnogenic substances in specific brain targets. Such a synthesis might be in keeping with the waking qualitative aspects. As an example, the hypnogenic CLIP peptide (ACTH(18-39)) is synthesized when stressful events occur during wakefulness. Second, when released during sleep within the nucleus raphe dorsalis (nRD) by dendrites of 5-HT neurons, it contributes to 5-HT perikarya silencing through an auto-inhibitory process. Nitric oxide, co-synthesized with 5-HT, may act in synergy with this amine at both mentioned levels. Regarding the triggered hypnogenic substances, they induce sleep through acting on two components within the nRD: (1) the 5-HT component; its silencing is necessary to remove the gating effect exerted on phasic sleep events (ponto-geniculo-occipital, PGO, waves); (2) a substance P component; its silencing is necessary, at least, to alleviate the tonic influence exerted on somatic muscles. These two components may constitute the brain "sleep switch-on" mechanism allowing wake/sleep alternation. Pharmacological procedures influencing this switch may be determinant for treating insomniac patients. Serotonin appears thus to be involved in sleep preparation, triggering and maintenance.

AB Modafinil, a wake-promoting compound now used worldwide in sleep medicine, was initially regarded as a sedative compound because mice were so quiet with respect to locomotion after receiving it that this behavioral state was qualified as sedation. In the early 1980's when modafinil was first assessed by polysomnography in a cat in our laboratory, surprisingly, the cat spent the whole night awake without even one minute of sleep! This initial observation resulted subsequently in a series of basic and clinical studies in order to define the pharmacological profile of modafinil and its mode of action and, notably, to identify the brain targets by which modafinil acts to promote wakefulness. These studies were undertaken using pharmacologic approach coupled with the Cerveau isole (brain transection) preparation, c-fos labelling and knockout mouse models. It was also in this context that we have developed a purified polyclonal antibody against modafinil. We expected that using immunohistochemistry with this antibody would allow us to localize the brain distribution of modafinil dosing. Surprisingly, we found discrete modafinil immunoreactive neuronal populations in several brain areas of modafinil-naive cats, rodents and humans. The most numerous and intensely labeled modafinil-immunoreactive neurons characterized by granular staining were found in the basal forebrain. They shared the regional location with cholinergic and aspartate-containing neurons but did not colocalize with them. In summary, we here present a newly identified neuronal population located in the basal forebrain that has never previously been published and suggests that these modafinil-immunoreactive neurons might be involved in forebrain functions such as sleep-wake control and cognition. This paper briefly reviews our journey with modafinil research and presents new unpublished experimental data. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) through its extensive efferent projections has been implicated in a great variety of physiological and behavioral functions including the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. This nucleus is composed of five sub-regions defined according to the distribution of its serotonergic (5-HT) neurons. In addition to its heterogeneity in neuronal populations, the DRN contains a great diversity of 5-HT neuronal subtypes identified based on their electrophysiological characteristics, morphology and subregional distribution. This suggests that the DRN sub-regions may play different functional roles. Recent studies reported long-range inputs specific to the 5-HT neurons of the DRN; but they did not differentiate whether some inputs were specific to a DRN sub-region, or another region. To fulfill this gap, we have previously described the forebrain afferents to the different sub-regions of the DRN using cholera toxin b subunit and Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin, as retrograde and anterograde tracers respectively. In the present work, we provide a detailed map of the brainstem projections to these different sub-regions. We show that if some brainstem structures project homogeneously to all sub-regions, most of the brainstem long-range inputs project in a topographically organized manner onto the DRN and, moreover, that a rich interconnected network is present within the DRN.

AB Michel Jouvet directed my medical thesis on paradoxical sleep in cats obtained in 1969, and my research on sleep in extreme environments (Antarctica, Arctic winter cold, physical exercise), which was the subject of my Ph.D. dissertation in 1984. As a military MD and scientist, I was posted in "exotic" (far away) places (Antarctica, Canada, Niger) and participated in several remote field trials (Canada, Cote d'Ivoire, Congo, Angola). Michel Jouvet supervised my research activity, allowing me the use of his laboratory facilities. He co-authored the work on sleep in Antarctica in 1987. In 1988, he was invited to Niamey (Niger) to preside on the international jury of medical doctorate dissertations. He then examined one of my patients with narcolepsy-like sleep attacks, suspect of sleeping sickness. Jouvet also co-authored our work on nitric oxide in the rat model of sleeping sickness. His scientific curiosity led him to study REM sleep eye movements in Bassari people, an isolated ethnic group in Senegal. With Monique Gessain, he co-authored a book on the Bassari oneiric activity. He was convinced that research in electricity-free villages was capital for understanding past mankind story. The present contribution recognizes the tremendous work capacity and scientific curiosity of Michel Jouvet. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Adrafinil, a new molecule identified by a French drug company, L. Lafon Ltd, in 1974, was found to cause a significant dose-dependent increase in motor activity in mice, without exerting peripheral sympathomimetic effects. As early as 1977-78, Michel Jouvet prescribed adrafinil to narcoleptic patients, but without consistent results. Meanwhile the kinetics of adrafinil led to the identification of an active metabolite, modafinil. In 1983, Jouvet and Bastuji prescribed modafinil to narcoleptic and idiopathic hypersomnia patients and obtained a significant decrease of excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep attacks in a majority of patients. L. Lafon Ltd was initially not interested in developing this molecule for market however, thanks to Jouvet's insistance, it decided to start clinical trials in both healthy volunteers and narcoleptic patients as well as conduct animal studies. Results were excellent and led to the use of modafinil by the French army during the Gulf War in January-February 1991, as well as to the official registration of the drug in France in 1992. Subsequent multicenter controlled clinical trials in North America confirmed the findings in Europe. Modafinil was later used to treat sleepiness, somnolence and fatigue in a large number of medical conditions. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine if the subjective improvements in daytime sleepiness, fatigue and depression experienced by patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy predict an objective improvement in vigilance, and whether patients with mild-to-moderate OSA differ from patients with severe OSA in this regard.
   Methods: A total of 182 patients underwent psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) testing and measurements of subjective daytime sleepiness, fatigue and depression at baseline and after a minimum of one month of adherent CPAP use at an adequate pressure.
   Results: Patients with both mild-to-moderate (n = 92) and severe (n = 90) OSA experienced improvements in subjective daytime sleepiness, fatigue and depression, but objective improvement in vigilance was only seen in patients with severe OSA. In patients with severe OSA, while a correlation was found between improvements in daytime sleepiness and some PVT parameters, changes in subjective daytime sleepiness, fatigue and depression scores were not predictive of objective improvement in vigilance while controlling for all these subjective symptoms and for age, gender, body mass index, apnea-hypopnea index/respiratory event index and total sleep time/total recording time with pulse oximetry below 90%.
   Conclusions: We found no predictive relationship between subjective improvements in daytime sleepiness, fatigue and depression and objective vigilance with CPAP use in patients with OSA. These results suggest that subjective complaints of daytime impairment and objective measures of vigilance in patients with OSA should be assessed separately while evaluating the efficacy of CPAP therapy on daytime functioning.

AB We assessed corticomotor excitability in the primary motor cortex (M1) of participants with moderateto-severe restless legs syndrome (RLS) symptoms using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in relation to the clinical and sleep aspects of the disease. Thirty-five participants (20 F; mean age: 59.23 +/- 1.66 years; range: 42-78 years) affected by primary RLS (off medications) and 31 age-matched controls (19 F; mean age: 57.90 +/- 1.50 years; range: 43-79 years) underwent TMS following two nights of polysomnography (PSG). Paired-pulse TMS measures [short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICE)] of the dominant M1(hand) and M1(leg) muscles were collected and analyzed in relation to clinical features of RLS and PSG. We found decreased corticomotor excitability in M1(hand), whereas it was increased in M1(leg), which was greater in patients with more severe RLS. Participants with RLS with a history of dopamine-agonist-induced symptom augmentation showed decreased LICI (reduced inhibition) compared to nonaugmented participants with RLS for M1(leg). None of the TMS measures (M1(hand) or M1(leg)) correlated with the PSG parameters. This study shows hyperexcitability in M1(leg), and this appears related to RLS disease severity and decreased excitability in M1(hand). The results provide new insight into the complex neurobiology of RLS, particularly in more advanced stages of the disease. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As a consequence of the negative influence of the transport sector on the environment, the European Union imposed a series of regulations that aim at reducing its harmful effect. Therefore, in the last decade, the increase in engine combustion and thermal efficiency, and a decrease in exhaust gas emissions are the primary goals of diesel engine research. The efficiency increase of the entire engine cycle is achieved by introducing different advanced operating strategies, such as optimisation of injection process and employment of various exhaust gas recirculation and engine boosting systems. This research presents a numerical study on the efficiency improvement of a turbocharged diesel engine using advanced engine operating strategies. A single operating point of a production type diesel engine was modelled by using the computational fluid dynamics tool AVL FIRE (TM). The results of released heat were transferred to a cycle engine simulation created in AVL BOOST (TM) that covers the entire engine system, including the intake and exhaust flow path, low and high pressure exhaust gas residual loops, exhaust gas residual and intake charge cooling, and turbomachinery. The cycle simulation was used to assess the entire engine system performance and cycle efficiency for different engine operating strategies. With the analysis performed in this work, it was concluded that the highest engine brake thermal efficiency of 31.86% could be achieved if a high pressure exhaust gas recirculation loop without electric compounding turbocharger is used.

AB Solar heating and cooling (SHC) systems are currently under rapid development and deployment due to their potential to reduce fossil fuel use and to alleviate greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector a sector which is responsible for 40% of the world energy use. The available technologies on the market for thermally driven cooling systems are absorption and adsorption chillers, solid and liquid desiccant cooling systems, and ejector refrigeration cycles. Of these, absorption chillers are considered as the most desirable method for harnessing solar thermal energy due to their relative maturity, reliability, and higher efficiency. In addition, absorption chillers can take advantage of economies of scale in large buildings to obtain a relatively good levelized cost of cooling as compared to other thermally-driven air-conditioning systems. In this paper, the background theory on solar-powered absorption chillers is presented followed by a comprehensive literature review of the recent existing theoretical and experimental investigations on this technology is conducted. The review shows that the majority of solar absorption chillers installed and much of the research around the world is based on single-effect chillers and low-temperature solar thermal collectors, while less emphasis has been placed on the combination of high-temperature solar thermal collectors and multi-effect absorption chillers, especially triple effect chillers. Research studies indicate the use of gas-fired backup systems for single-effect chillers is inefficient due to its very low primary energy savings. It was also found that the storage tank and piping can be major sources of heat losses in solar absorption cooling systems. Thus, special care should be taken to ensure sufficient and appropriate insulation for all heat loss components. In regions with low direct normal incidence solar resources (e.g. most of Europe), solar multi-effect chillers are relatively inefficient, so single-effect chiller-based solar cooling systems are the best techno-economic choice in such regions. Conversely, multi-effect absorption chillers with high-temperature collectors are indeed promising in regions with high solar resources. However, the review shows that using currently available technology, SHC absorption chillers are not able to economically compete with conventional cooling without government subsidies and incentives. Therefore, improving the economic performance of these systems is essential. While there is clearly more that can be done on chiller and solar collector components themselves, we believe some R&D emphasis going forward should also be dedicated to the balance of the system, including optimization of the system configuration, minimizing parasitic losses, improved design and integration of thermal storage and auxiliary system, and numerous controls and operational aspects. To date, many of these topics have been largely overlooked in favor of chiller performance studies.

AB This paper presents mathematical modeling and economic analysis of a medium size combined heat and power (CHP) operation, installed in Poland. The plant is equipped with steam boilers, extraction condensing turbine, and the grade type water boilers. The paper determines the most efficient mode of CHP operations. The economic efficiency analysis is performed for transient seasons, characterized by low demands for heating, which obliged production units to operate out of its nominal conditions at a lower efficiency. The developed method is also suitable for analyzing complex power plants, with a few energy equipments.
   The developed mathematical model for simulating CHP performance gives the possibility to select the boiler type, and assess the probability and efficiency of each configuration. The dedicated tool calculates the selected operation mode, heating power demand, and enables models comparison. The algorithm includes real equipment operational parameters, technical limitations, actual energy prices and costs regarding energy law acts. The performed analysis is up-to-date, due to a few aspects: permanently increased fossil fuels costs, low electric energy prices, growing costs of CO2 emission allowances, and high electricity production cost on turbine's condensing section at steam parameters of T = 435 degrees C and p = 34 bar. A detailed cost analysis is performed on each product separately: thermal energy, electric energy from cogeneration and electric energy from condensation, during every hour, frequently. The calculation is carried every an hour for a period of 24 h, the energy balance is ensured during the calculation. The most important result of this study is a comparison of CHP to water boiler operation profitability, also including the net profit comparison. Furthermore, the cost of the CO2 emission is studied, for the production profitability in two scenarios, as the price increases from 7 EUR/tone to 15 EUR/tone and 30 EUR/tone.

AB A simple, green, and energy efficient method for the biodiesel production has been developed using Fresnel lens solar concentrator (FSC). The transesterification of hempseed oil using FSC approach and conventional heating approach was studied by varying different process variables such as molar ratio, catalyst loading, reaction time, and stirring speed with an objective to establish benefits of FSC method. The highest biodiesel yield of 97.37% was obtained for FSC method in 4 min of reaction time with reaction conditions of molar ratio 4.5:1, catalyst loading 0.9 wt%, temperature about 60 degrees C, and 200 rpm. While, conventional heating method yielded only 21.3% of biodiesel in similar reaction conditions. To obtain similar yield (97%), conventional heating method required 70 min of reaction time at molar ratio of 6:1, temperature of 60 degrees C, catalyst loading of 1.05 wt%, and stirring speed of 300 rpm. Energy efficiency for both the methods was calculated, and observed that FSC method is 73 times more energy efficient than conventional heating method. Therefore, FSC method intensifies the process by reducing the requirements of time, energy, molar ratio and catalyst amount. The physicochemical properties like acid value (0.23 mg of KOH/g of oil), density (0.87 g/cm(3)), kinematic viscosity (3.12 mm(2)/s), pour point (-1 degrees C) and flash point (153 degrees C) of synthesized biodiesel were also compared with American Chemical Society for the Materials (ASTM) D6751 standard and found within the limit.

AB In this paper, a novel perturbation observer based fractional-order PID (PoFoPID) control scheme is proposed for a grid-connected Photovoltaics (PV) inverter to harvest the available maximum solar energy from the PV arrays under various atmospheric conditions. A high-gain state and perturbation observer (HGSPO) is adopted to efficiently estimate the aggregated effect of PV inverter nonlinearities, parameter uncertainties, unmodelled dynamics, stochastic fluctuation of atmospheric conditions, and external disturbances. Then, a fractional-order PID (FoPID) control is employed to fully compensate the perturbation estimate and to significantly improve the dynamical responses of the closed-loop system, in which Yin-Yang-Pair optimization (YYPO) algorithm is used to rapidly and effectively seek its optimal control parameters. Inspiringly, PoFoPID control can simultaneously own the elegant merits of global control consistency and robustness of perturbation observer based control, high reliability and simple structure of FoPID control, as well as the global optimality of YYPO algorithm. Four case studies including the solar irradiation change, temperature variation, power grid voltage drop, and inverter parameter uncertainties are undertaken. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the PoFoPID control compared to that of PID control, FoPID control, feedback linearization control (FLC), and sliding-mode control (SMC), respectively. At last, a dSpace based hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiment is carried out to validate the implementation feasibility of PoFoPID control.

AB This paper presents the exergy and exergoeconomic analyses of a typical combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system under off-design conditions. The exergoeconomic-related parameters and unit exergoeconomic cost of the flows are discussed using the exergy cost allocation method based on energy level (ECAEL). The absorption chiller is found to have an improved potential because of the highest relative cost difference and its continual increase with the decrease of the output power. According to the exergoeconomic factor analysis, the exergoeconomic performance of the turbine and combustor among all the components can be enhanced by decreasing the investment and destruction, respectively. Next, the unit energy costs of different products in the output power range (100-20%) including electricity, cooling and heating energy for users, are calculated. The results show that the electricity increases faster than that of other products from 0.537 to 1.077 Yuan/kWh. Finally, the sensitivity analyses for the unit energy cost of the products are presented with different influencing parameters, such as the natural gas price, service life and discount rate. This exergoeconomic analysis may provide guidance for evaluating the products in distributed energy systems for energy networks.

AB Thermal performance enhancement of membrane based energy recovery ventilators (ERV) under turbulent flow conditions is investigated utilizing the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. The standard k-epsilon model was adopted with the enhanced wall treatment option to simulate conjugate heat and mass transfer across the membrane. A user defined function was developed and incorporated into FLUENT to simulate the heat and mass transfer processes across a variable resistance 60 gsm membrane. A mesh sensitivity analysis was conducted and the developed CFD model was validated against an in-house experimental data. The performance of the investigated ERV was tested under different number of: flow channels, flow configurations, weather conditions and air flowrates. Results have shown that face velocity is more significant than flow separator in affecting the thermal performance of the investigated ERVs with a ratio of almost 5 to 1. Furthermore, the layout of the quasi counter flow might present a preferable overall option over the L-Shape hybrid flow option. The final decision would be dependent on the HVAC system in-use and the higher priority between pressure drop, thermal energy recovered, manufacturability and/or installation.

AB The bio-syngas formed from the catalytic cracking of bio-oil include two types of useful components which are light olefin and H-2, CO. The integration of FTS and olefinic polymerization seems potential way for the production of hydrocarbon bio-fuels while fully utilizing the olefin-rich bio-syngas. This work aimed to develop an integrated process for the production of liquid hydrocarbons directly from the olefin-rich bio-syngas through a one-stage process, which included the synthesis of liquid hydrocarbons via the oligomerization of light olefin over HZSM-5 along with the FT (Fischer-Tropsch) synthesis of H-2, CO over FeMn catalyst. A series of integration configuration composed of Fe-based catalyst (FeMn) and acidic zeolite (HZSM-5) were investigated, it was found that the undesired hydrogenation of lower olefin on the nearby metal active site seems greatly affected the yield of C5 +. More significantly, the proximity of the two active components plays a crucial role in suppressing the undesired hydrogenation reaction and contributing to the high selectivity of liquid hydrocarbons. The optimal catalytic performance yields a high selectivity to gasoline-range hydrocarbons (87.3%) with excellent low olefin hydrogenation selectivity (7.4%). Meanwhile, the obtained gasoline-range hydrocarbon showed high degree of isomerization. The integrated transformation process potentially provides an alternative way for the production of gasoline range isomerized hydrocarbon fuels using olefin-rich bio-syngas.

AB The purpose of this paper is to study the equipment parameters of expressway convective wind energy collection devices and determine the optimal structural parameters by numerical methods. Firstly, the characteristics of convection wind energy and flow field on the expressway are analyzed and the principle of wind energy utilization is determined. Based on traditional resistance wind turbines, two different blades of the device are designed and developed. Some structural parameters (such as blade height and the number of blades) of the device are discussed based on the flow field characteristics. Secondly, the device is numerically simulated using Star CCM + software, and the optimal structural parameters are determined based on the power coefficient. Thirdly, the proposed numerical analysis method is verified and indirect verification is used to determine the most suitable turbulence model and grid independence based on the similarity principle. Based on the above research results, the experimental verification is used to determine the high reliability of the simulation model. Finally, the simulation results between the Rectangular turbine and the Savonius turbine are compared and obtained. The results show that the device is useful for the wind energy usage, wind energy conversion and the wind resistance reduction of the opposite vehicle. At the same time, when the inlet wind speed is 15 m/s, the tip speed ratio (TSR) is 1.4, the device is rectangular turbine (RT), the height of blade is 1.55 m, the number of blades is 4, and the maximum power coefficient C-p is 0.363.

AB In this study, a thermodynamic assessment of an integrated solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with a steam biomass gasification and high-temperature sodium heat pipes for combined heating and power production as a cogeneration system is conducted. In this regard, rice husk is used as feedstock. The modeling and analysis of the system is performed using mass and energy conservation laws and equilibrium constants. The results of the extended model are confirmed by experimental results. The effect of steam to biomass ratio (STBR) on the performance of the system is investigated. According to the results, more number of heat pipes and higher heat rate of gasification are needed at high STBR. Also, the effects of key parameters including the current density, the fuel utilization ratio (U-f), and the fuel cell temperature are studied on the produced power and electrical, thermal, and total efficiencies. The results indicate that the produced power and electrical and total efficiencies of the integrated system enhance by increasing temperature whiles increasing the current density decreases the total efficiency. By selecting the processing parameters at their optimum levels, the outputs are achieved as the power of 208 kW, the electrical efficiency of 43.71%, the thermal efficiency of 30.6%, and the total efficiency of 74.31%.

AB An appropriate operation strategy is the requirement to obtain high-efficiency performance of a combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system. In this paper, the inlet air throttling (IAT) operation method for gas turbine combined with following the electric load (FEL), following the thermal load (FTL) and following the hybrid electric-thermal load (FHL) operation strategies are employed to analyze the primary energy consumption (PEC), carbon dioxide emission (CDE) and operation cost (COST) with respect to a CCHP system in Beijing, China. The matching between the different operation strategies and the energy demands of the reference building are analyzed to reveal the energy saving mechanism. The results indicate that the CCHP system is superior to the separate system on annual evaluation regardless of which operation strategy is used. Moreover, the economic performances of different operation strategies are evaluated based on the payback period (PBP). Finally, the sensitivity analyses of main component parameters and economic factors are presented for the PEC and PBP of the CCHP system, respectively. This study may provide a guidance to utilize the IAT operation method economically and efficiently.

AB Multiple marine resources are usually available in the same area and synergies between the different users of these resources exist. Multipurpose platforms, which combine more than one of these renewable resources, have been proposed as a sustainable approach. One type of multipurpose platforms is the hybrid wind-wave systems, in which a single platform combines the exploitation of offshore wind and wave energy. In this paper a novel hybrid system that integrates an oscillating water column (OWC) wave energy converter (WEC) with an offshore wind turbine on a monopile substructure is considered. The main objective of this paper is to define and test a simplified version of the WEC sub-system of this hybrid energy converter. An experimental campaign was carried out to characterise the hydrodynamic response of a 1:37.5 scale model of the WEC sub-system under regular and irregular waves. On the basis of the data from the experimental campaign, the hydrodynamic response of the WEC sub-system is characterised in four steps: (i) through an incident and reflected wave analysis (IRWA), to characterise the interaction between the device and the waves; (ii) through the capture width ratio, to study the performance of the device; (iii) through response amplitude operators (RAOs) of the free surface elevation and pneumatic pressure inside the OWC chamber, to study the effects of the incident waves on the device response; and (iv) through the wave run-up on the device. The results from this multifaceted analysis lead to the proof of concept of this novel hybrid system, supporting its feasibility to be combined with offshore wind substructures; but also to characterise its behaviour and interaction with the wave field, essential to full understanding of the benefits of hybrid systems.

AB To restrain the CO2 concentration in atmosphere, deployment of the carbon-negative energy generation devices is indispensable on account of the vast net carbon discharge every year. In this work, a novel and promising quadruple fluidized bed (QFB) reactor for the biomass/coal co-gasification is proposed to generate the high quality syngas whilst separate CO2 for further sequestration or utilization. To reveal the fundamental rules governing the reactor, a one dimensional model coupling the gas-solid flow hydrodynamics and the chemical reaction kinetics is built to simulate the physicochemical processes in the QFB, and the effects of several pivotal operation parameters on the reactor performance are comprehensively analyzed. It is found that the QFB runs stably under the given condition. The H-2 mole fraction in the dry syngas is higher than 70%, the CO2 mole fraction in the dry flue gas is around 97%, and the net carbon discharge can be negative when the biomass blending ratio is over 0.5. The methodology and findings in this work are of reference value for the lab, pilot or industrial scale QFB designation and operation, and can be extended to develop similar novel reactors for the carbon-negative energy generation.

AB In recent years, the Brazilian electricity sector has seen a considerable reduction in hydroelectric production and an increase in dependence on the complementation of thermoelectric power plants to meet the energy demand. This issue has led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which has intensified climate change and modified rainfall regimes in several regions of the country, as well as increased the cost of energy. The use of floating PV plants in coordinated operation with hydroelectric plants can establish a mutual compensation between these sources and replace a large portion of the energy that comes from thermal sources, thereby reducing the dependence on thermoelectric energy for hydropower complementation. Thus, this paper presents a procedure for technically and economically sizing floating PV plants for coordinated operation with hydroelectric plants. A case study focused on the hydroelectric plants of the Sao Francisco River basin, where there has been intense droughts and increased dependence on thermoelectric energy for hydropower complementation. The results of the optimized design show that a PV panel tilt of approximately 3 degrees can generate energy at the lowest cost (from R $298.00/MWh to R$312.00/MWh, depending on the geographical location of the FLOATING PV platform on the reservoir). From an energy perspective, the average energy gain generated by the hydroelectric plant after adding the floating PV generation was 76%, whereas the capacity factor increased by 17.3% on average. In terms of equivalent inflow, the PV source has a seasonal profile that compliments the natural inflow of the river. Overall, the proposed coordinated operation could replace much of the thermoelectric generation in Brazil.

AB A novel trigeneration system which integrates a SOFC system, an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), and an ammonia water absorption chiller with a CO2 capture system is proposed and investigated. The exhaust gas from SOFC anode combusts with pure O-2 instead of air and thus the combustion products mainly consist of CO2 and H2O, which the CO2 can be captured easily by the condensation method; in SOFC cathode side, a series-connected ORC and ammonia water absorption chiller heat recovery system which can produce power, heat and cooling is employed to recover the waste heat of SOFC cathode exhaust gas. A mathematical model is developed to study the system performance under steady-state conditions. The calculated results show that the net electrical efficiency and the exergy efficiency of the integrated system can reach 52.83% and 59.96%, respectively. The trigeneration efficiencies of the combined system without and with CO2 capture are 74.28% and 72.23%, respectively. The effects of the SOFC inlet temperature, the current density, the steam-to-carbon ratio, the pinch point temperature difference and the turbine II inlet pressure on the trigeneration system performances are investigated in detail. The research achievement in this paper can provide the useful reference for SOFC based trigeneration system with low energy consumption for CO2 capture.

AB The work analyses process intensification in production of fermentative biofuel (bioethanol) in a multi-staged membrane integrated bioreactor system from sugarcane juice (SCJ) using Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCIM 3205). Membrane based clarification, sterilization and concentration of sugar cane juice could replace several energy-intensive and polluting steps of conventional production schemes. Integration of traditional bioreactor with membrane-based devices for downstream purification of bioethanol enabled the system for recycling of cells and residual sugars to the fermentation unit through largely fouling free cross flow microfiltration and nanofiltration membrane modules. The new process design is characterized by high yield (0.48 g/g), productivity (14.6 g/L/h) and concentration capability (97.6 g/L) using concentrated SCJ of 22 wt% under high cell density in a flexible, compact, eco-friendly and modular plant. The final membrane distillation stage concentrated similar to 98% pure ethanol in a solar-driven direct contact membrane distillation configuration using PTFE/PET hydrophobic membrane with enhanced flux with vis-a-vis the existing processes. A rectangular flat sheet cross flow membrane module in counter-current flow mode of hot and cold streams was employed. The membrane-based system achieves quite high levels of process intensification essential to sustainable operation at industrial scale. The achieved process intensification in the new system has been analysed vis-a-vis the existing conventional systems in terms of eco-friendliness, flexibility, cost of equipment and production, consumption of energy and material, profitability, E-factor, atom efficiency and business sustainability.

AB A novel integrated system for the production of hydrogen at a high pressure utilizing steel furnace waste heat is presented and analyzed in this paper. The system utilizes a hybrid thermochemical copper-chlorine (Cu-Cl) cycle. This study integrates the industrial waste heat source with the thermochemical Cu-Cl cycle combined with a hydrogen compression system. The electrical energy required by the system is provided by a supporting Rankine cycle. The hydrogen compression system compresses hydrogen to a pressure of 750 bars. The integrated system is simulated with Aspen Plus software. Energy and exergy analyses are performed for the integrated system. Results from the simulations are presented and discussed. The overall energy efficiency is 38.2% and overall exergy efficiency is found to be 39.8%.

AB For the purpose of decreasing the release of greenhouse gases into the air, the emission concerns must be taken into account in evaluation of a large-scale user besides the economic concerns. Moreover, it is possible to utilize a multi-purpose energy center scheme to provide thermal and electrical energy by the large-scale users. Hence, this study suggests a new multi-objective model based on cost-emission, operation cost of large-scale user and efficiency of electrical storage system based on hub system with involvement of peak load management. In this model, the electrical storage system is considered as one of the objectives to be maximize. Compromise programming is suggested as a solution for the presented multi-objective method to achieve the Pareto solutions. Moreover, a new fuzzy decision making procedure is chosen in order to choose a trade-off solution by application of Enhanced Pareto filter. Ultimately, peak load management is applied to smooth the load curve and decrease the expenses and emissions regarding the operation. The suggested approach is defined as a mixed-integer linear program that is possible to be solved by implementing the proposed solution way. The proposed model is applied on two test cases and compared with achieved outcomes from other models in order to verify the functionality of the suggested method.

AB In the exhaust thermoelectric generator system with media fluid, the media fluid first transfers heat directly from the exhaust. Then, the media fluid is used for thermoelectric generation after heating. Therefore, the exhaust heat exchange process and the thermoelectric generation process are separate processes. A numerical simulation of this system is conducted in this paper. The results show that the output power of the thermoelectric generator system with media fluid first increases and then decreases with an increase in the module area when the exhaust heat exchange area is fixed, i.e., there is an optimal module area to maximize the output power of the system. Compared with the traditional thermoelectric generator system, for a certain condition of the exhaust heat exchange area, although the maximum output power of the novel system decreases slightly, the corresponding module area can be reduced by 74.2%. Consequently, the power generation density can reach 1254 W/m(2), which is 3.39 times higher than that of a traditional exhaust thermoelectric generator system. In addition, the temperature distribution along the module of the thermoelectric generator system with media fluid is more uniform.

AB This paper conducts an investigation on the temperature variations experienced by the fuel when it expands through the calibrated orifices of a commercial diesel injector. Experimental results of the temperature change across a calibrated orifice upon expansion, extracted from a previous work, are compared to the temperature predicted by computational fluid dynamic simulations under the assumption of adiabatic flow, with no heat transfer to the surroundings. The comparison points out that the simulations are able to predict the thermal effects taking place inside the orifice. Once the model is validated, the flow morphology is analyzed to explain the trends observed in the fuel temperature change across the orifice depending on the operating conditions. Two opposed effects take place inside the orifice: on the one hand, the flow is cooled in the orifice core due to depressurization; on the other hand, the fuel is importantly heated near the walls due to viscous friction. As expected, the net effect on the outlet temperature mainly depends on the orifice discharge coefficient, governed by the orifice geometry and the flow regime (Reynolds number) induced by the injection conditions. Next, the analysis is extended to a diesel nozzle, considering that the higher pressure drops achieved in it are expected to induce even more important thermal effects. The two opposed effects also take place inside the orifice. Even though their net effect is similar, the separate effect of each phenomenon is greater, leading to differences that could be relevant for the atomization and spray formation processes. Additionally, the flow pattern shows a non-uniform distribution of the flow inside the nozzle influencing the results from the thermal point of view.

AB In this paper, a water-heated humidification dehumidification (HDH) desalination system, which is powered by the waste exhaust gas from a furnace, is applied to produce water. In order to overcome the corrosion from the seawater on the dehumidifier with a general heat exchanger, the packed bed is used to achieve the dehumidification process. Based on the mathematical models for the HDH desalination system, the relevant thermodynamic and economic performance are acquired. Furthermore, the influences from the effectiveness, top and ambient temperatures on the aforementioned performance are also investigated. The simulation results show that peak values of the water production and gained-output-ratio (GOR) are obtained as 84.60 kg h(-1) and 1.44 at the balance condition of the dehumidifier. The total cost for all the heat and mass transfer areas rises from 470.81$ to 701.46$ when the mass flow rate of the dry air increases from 0.1 kg s(-1) at to 0.5 kg s(-1), while the unit cost of water production (UCWP) ascends from 6.20$ kg(-1) h to 13.41$ kg(-1) h. Furthermore, raising the effectiveness, reducing the spraying temperature into the humidifier is always effective to cut the unit cost of water production, while it is only useful within a limited range of air mass flow rate for a higher ambient temperature.

AB This research investigates the effect of nanoparticle-diesel fuel blends on combustion characteristics, performances and exhaust emissions of a four-stroke single-cylinder diesel engine. Three types of nanoparticles employed in this experiment were aluminium oxide, carbon nanotubes and silicon oxide. The nanoparticles were dispersed in a dosage of 25 ppm, 50 ppm and 100 ppm with pure diesel and were labelled as DA25, DA50, DA100 (aluminium oxide blends), DC25, DC50, DC100 (carbon nanotubes blends) and DS25, DS50, DS100 (silicon oxide blends). The ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer analysis was done for 200 h to quantify the stability of the nanoparticle-diesel fuel blends. The blended fuels were experimentally tested with YANMAR TF120M diesel engine at engine loads of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% at a constant 1800 rpm engine speed. The results revealed that the brake specific fuel consumption reduced by up to 19.8% and brake thermal efficiency enhanced by 18.8%. Silicon oxide blends show better results than aluminium oxide blends in many aspects, such as higher combustion pressure, lower brake specific fuel consumption and lower carbon monoxide emissions. Aluminium oxide and silicon oxide show stable blend conditions with 28.1% and 22.0% absorption ratio at 200 h sedimentation time, while carbon nanotube blends were least stable with absorption ratio reducing to less than 30% after 10 h. Combustion analysis of carbon nanotube blends with diesel show that carbon nanotubes have the potential to be further researched as an additive for diesel fuel due to significant combustion improvement in NO. emissions. However, the issue on the stability of carbon nanotube blends must be resolved before its potential can be fully utilized.

AB Individual metering and charging of heat and domestic hot water is one of the possibilities for reducing the energy consumption in existing multifamily buildings and, with this aim in mind, the EU-directive 2012/27/EU enforced the installation of individual heat consumption meters. Even though some experimental evaluation of energy savings that may be achieved in multifamily buildings with individual metering & charging systems can be found in the literature, the majority of these research pieces are focused on case studies or taking into consideration conditions related to cold climates, and there is still a lack of studies focused on evaluating its effects in more temperate climates that can be also found in Europe. Thus, in this paper, the potential of individual metering and charging of heat and hot water for saving energy in residential buildings in temperate climates is evaluated and quantified. To do so, a literature review on implementation of this system is carried out and presented firstly to get a better understanding of its implications on energy consumption in buildings. Afterwards, heating and hot water consumption data collected in a multifamily building where individual metering and charging system was implemented is evaluated in detail. With the aim of quantifying its effect on heating and hot water consumption, data corresponding to four complete heating seasons (two heating seasons prior to its implementation, and the two first heating seasons after implementing it) have been evaluated in detail, following a specific method described in the paper. Results show that individual metering and charging has brought a reduction of normalized energy consumption of 15-20% during the first two years after implementing it, and simple payback periods are around 10 years. These results confirm that individual metering and charging affects directly on user behaviour encouraging inhabitants to change their habits to reduce their energy consumption, and this effect is significant even in European temperate climates, such as the evaluated case study shows.

AB At present, large extraction condensing turbine units are generally adopted for combined heating in the cogeneration plants of northern China. A large amount of condensed waste heat of the exhaust steam releasing to the environment leads to a great heat loss of the cold end system. The novel cogeneration system significantly improves energy efficiency of the plant by efficiently recovering the condensed waste heat of multi turbine units. For the turbine units with complete recovery of the condensed waste heat, the corresponding cooling towers are closed during the freezing period. With the reduction of the heat load, the surplus condensed waste heat should be discharged by the cooling towers. However, the outdoor wet-bulb temperature is very low during the severe cold period, which results in a surplus of the cooling capacity of the cooling towers. When releasing a small amount of the condensed waste heat, the cooling towers may confront with the frozen risk. A new type of connecting and switching method for the cold end system of the multi turbine units is proposed to avoid the frozen risk. On this basis, with the method of equivalent electricity of heating, an optimized combined heating operation strategy is proposed for the multi turbine units under full operating conditions. The case study takes 4 x 300 MW turbine units as an example, the heat load regulation process is simulated according to the optimized strategy and the discussions are made on the seven regulation stages. Furthermore, the heating performance of the absorption heat pumps and the variation and distribution regularities of the energy consumptions during the heating period are analyzed in detail. Case study results show that, the heating coefficient of performance of the absorption heat pumps is obviously improved after the steam-water heat exchanger withdraws from heating. Compared with the traditional cogeneration heating system, the novel cogeneration system reduces heating energy consumption by 47.7% under the premise of avoiding the frozen risk of the cooling towers during the winter.

AB This work proposes a reduced-order sliding mode observer (SMO) based nonlinear control to regulate a multi variable proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) integrated system. To make this system reversible, it is integrated with an air compressor, air cooler, primary manifold, supply manifold, humidifier and return manifold. To recirculate the unreacted hydrogen fuel, an ejector and to suppress the fuel cell heat of reaction, a simple water cooled heat exchange system is modeled. Among the three measured outputs, namely output voltage (main product), compressor air flow and fuel cell body temperature, the last two are proposed to control at their desired values to avoid oxygen starvation at cathode side and adverse effect of system temperature, respectively. To increase the lifetime of proton exchange membrane fuel cell and its smooth operation, a model based sliding mode controller (SMC) is synthesized, coupling with a nonlinear sliding mode observer required to estimate the unmeasured state information. This observer is formulated based on the reduced-order process model that leads to a process/model mismatch. Further, a saturation function is included in the sliding mode control theory in order to avoid the chattering effect. The performance of the proposed nonlinear observer based sliding mode controller is finally investigated by comparing with the conventional proportional integral (PI) controller in terms of servo (output voltage and fuel cell body temperature) and regulatory (load current) responses.

AB Using renewable energy in the distributed energy systems has large potential to ease the excessive use of fossil fuels and the environmental problems. Selecting a new and efficient system scheme of utilizing the renewable energy to meet various user load is decisive to improve the technical, economical and environmental performances. This work presents a detailed research on a new CCHP based on synthetic utilization of biogas and solar energy. Unlike the conventional biogas-fired CCHP in which biogas is directly burned for utilization, biogas in the hybrid system is first transformed to the syngas via biogas reforming reaction which is assisted by the solar energy, and then used in an efficient tri-generation system. A system optimization model based on the comprehensive evaluation criteria is established under Lhasa Tibet weather data to optimize the key parameters of the CCHP following the electric load (FEL) by genetic algorithm (GA). The optimal engine capacity and hydraulic retention time are 1052 kW and 260.2 h, respectively. A biogas-fired CCHP and a solar Dish/Stirling power system are adopted as the reference systems, and the comparative analysis is presented to show the advanced annual efficiency of the hybrid CCHP. The saving ratios of natural gas and electricity from outside the system reach 3.3% and 77.8%, respectively. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to indicate the effects of the prices of electricity, natural gas and refrigeration on the system dynamic operation performances. The electricity price has the biggest impact on the dynamic payback period of the proposed system. The research may provide a mutual beneficial way to use biogas and solar energy efficiently and economically.

AB Co-liquefaction of algal biomass (AB) and sawdust (SD) was investigated in ethanol-water mixed solvent for the production of bio-crude. Effects of temperature (200-300 degrees C), residence time (30-120 min), ethanol-water mixed solvent composition (0/100-100/0 wt/wt), and AB/SD mass ratio (0/100-100/0) on the products distribution were explored. The results indicated that both AB/SD and ethanol/water exhibited positive synergistic effects on the co-liquefaction process. The highest bio-crude yield of 58 wt% was obtained from co-liquefaction of AB and SD (50/50, wt/wt) in ethanol-water (75/25, wt/wt) mixed solvent at 250 degrees C for 60 min. In addition, the biocrude produced from the mixed feedstocks contained a higher fraction of light oil components than that produced from only AB or SD. In addition, this work demonstrated the promise of recycling the aqueous by-product form the co-liquefaction process as a reaction medium for the process, aiming to reduce overall waste generation and increase the bio-crude quality.

AB The present paper aims at assessing the carbon and energy footprint of an innovative process for carbon dioxide recycling, with flue gas as feedstock of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Nitrogen is converted into ammonia through the Haber-Bosch process and carbon dioxide into methane via Sabatier reaction using hydrogen produced by renewable electricity excess. Carbon and energy footprint analysis of the process was assessed based on experimental data related to hydrogen production by electrolysis, methane synthesis via Sabatier reaction, energy consumption and energy output of the process units for flue gas separation, carbon dioxide methanation and ammonia synthesis. A Life Cycle Assessment method is applied, based on the experimental and computational data, both in case of renewable electricity excess and electricity from the grid. Results show that in case of renewable electricity excess, for a functional unit of 1 kg of treated flue gas, the specific carbon footprint is 0.7819 kg(CO2eq) and energy footprint is 50.73 MJ, which correspond to 4.012 kg and 260.3 MJ per 1 kg of produced hydrogen. In case of electricity from the grid, the specific carbon footprint is 1.550 kg(CO2eq), and energy footprint is 59.12 MJ per flue gas mass unit. If the carbon footprint is positive, the process indirectly leads to avoided emissions, ranging from 0.673 to 0.844 kg(CO2eq) kg(flugas)(-1), thus proving the sustainability of the proposed pathway.

AB The increasing number of elderly people (over 65 years of age), long-term home care policies and the generally higher energy demand of houses inhabited by elderly people will pose an energy challenge for the built environment. The paper analyses the benefits of poly-generation technologies, focusing on the case of hard to heat homes in Northern Ireland. The energy consumption of a test house that is representative of 28% of Northern Ireland housing stock and of a house with elderly inhabitants has been monitored without any intervention. An optimization procedure has been developed to identify the optimal mix of poly-generation technologies. The technologies considered are micro-combined heat and power, heat pump and photovoltaic systems with possible integration of thermal energy storage systems. Six scenarios based on different energy tariffs and technology incentives have been presented. In the best case scenario, the combination of photovoltaic, heat pump and thermal energy storage provides 26% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and 80% savings in the energy bill compared to standard energy generation. The investment required would be in the order of 11,000 pound. In Northern Ireland, 307,000 households (79.1% more than in 2012) will have elderly inhabitants by 2037. The adoption of poly-generation technologies in the older housing stock could lead to 8% reduction of carbon dioxide emissions of the entire residential sector, with 150 GWh increase in the electricity generation from renewable energy without affecting the electricity distribution network.

AB Integrating combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system with biomass gasification is a sustainable distributed energy system to effectively utilize biomass resource and improve energy efficiency. In order to achieve a higher energy efficiency and more cost-effective operation, a thermoeconomic cost analysis method based on the exergetic cost theory is applied to the CCHP system based on biomass gasification. Firstly, the exergetic cost and thermoeconomic cost of all flows in the system are calculated in different operation modes. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is presented to obtain the thermoeconomic cost variations of the products along with the influence factors, such as service life, interest rate, operation hours and biomass cost. The results indicate that the unit exergetic cost of electricity is 4.447, 4.445 and 4.447 for the summer, winter and transition season operation conditions, whereas the thermoeconomic cost is 240.004RMB/h, 257.905RMB/h and 270.811RMB/h, respectively, while for domestic hot water, these values are 14.822, 14.817, 27.086 and 33.361RMB/h, 35.769RMB/h, 166.284RMB/h, respectively. The unit exergetic cost of water for cooling and heating is 8.804 and 7.465, the thermoeconomic cost is 138.807RMB/h and 147.454RMB/h, respectively. From the sensitive analysis, the biomass cost is the most sensitive factor to the thermoeconomic cost of the products. The results also reflect that a combination of the thermoeconomic cost based on exergetic cost and sensitivity analysis method is a powerful and efficient tool for evaluating the performance of multi-product energy system.

AB As an effective strategy to control the combustion of advanced combustion modes, the application of variable valve timing (VVT) in reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) combustion was investigated in this study. By coupling KIVA-3V code with genetic algorithm, the combustion of a heavy-duty engine with RCCI combustion combined with VVT strategy was optimized under a wide load range. At each load, six operating parameters including premix ratio (PR), intake valve closing (IVC) timing, start of injection, exhaust gas re-circulation rate, intake pressure, and intake temperature were optimized to realize low-emission and high-efficiency combustion. The optimization results indicate that, at low load, high PR coupled with either late IVC or base IVC can be utilized for the realization of high thermal efficiency. At mid load, the base IVC strategy is integrated with high PR, while the late IVC strategy is coupled with low PR. At high load, only the strategy with late IVC and low PR can be used. The strategy with higher PR and earlier IVC timing exhibits better engine performance on thermal efficiency and soot emissions, while the strategy with lower premix ratio and later IVC timing is superior in ringing intensity. By optimizing the RCCI combustion with the VVT strategy, the Euro 6 NOx limit can be met while maintaining ultra-low soot emissions at low and mid load. However, at least one after-treatment device is required to further eliminate the NOx or soot emissions at high load. Under the whole load conditions, satisfactory fuel consumption can be obtained.

AB Poplar is considered a suitable resource for production of renewable fuels and chemicals due to its rapid growth and tolerance to environmental stresses. Switchgrass is also extensively studied for biofuel production due to its use as a resource-efficient low-input plant and ability to grow and thrive in diverse weather or soil conditions. In this study, fast pyrolysis of biomass obtained from various parts (main stem, secondary stems, branches) of eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatwn) was carried out in an inductively heated reactor. Devolatilization rates (ranging from 450 degrees C to 600 degrees C) were initially obtained to determine their decomposition kinetics and estimate process parameters (temperatures and times) suitable for their pyrolysis using this method of pyrolysis. The effect of temperature (450 degrees C, 500 degrees C, 550 degrees C) on pyrolysis product yields and composition was investigated. Results indicate that activation energies ranged from 9.2 to 13.5 kJ/mol, while pre-exponential constants ranged from 0.23 to 0.51 s(-1). The maximum quantity of bio-oil of 39.8% +/- 9.50 was obtained from poplar stem at 450 degrees C whereas the least amount of bio-oil obtained was 33% +/- 0.0085 from poplar branch at 550 degrees C. The highest amount of bio-oils from switchgrass (34% +/- 0.023) was obtained at 450 degrees C. Water content in the bio-oil obtained from switchgrass was significantly higher than that from poplar. The GC-MS results showed that bio-oil compositions are similar among the various parts of poplar trees, with phenols being the dominant chemical specie and acids and alcohols present in negligible amounts. As temperature increases, an increase in furans is observed. Bio-oil and char fractions derived from stems have higher HHV than those from switchgrass, with the average HHV of char and water-free bio-oils ranging between 20.2 and 25.6 MJ/kg and 13.2 and -16.4 MJ/kg, respectively. Overall process energy recovery from initial biomass reached a maximum of 80.1% in the case of cottonwood main stem pyrolyzed at 500 degrees C.

AB Hydrogen (H-2) owns some excellent fuel specialties and can be used as enhancer to improve the performance of original engine. In the present survey, percent of performance improvement of a Wankel gasoline rotary engine by H-2 enrichment was experimentally studied. The tested engine was initially run at idling and then 3000 rpm with an intake pressure of 37.5 kPa. For the two tested operations, H-2 energy percent (beta(H2)) in the total energy was varied from 0% to 37.0% and 0% to 28.3%, respectively. Results indicated that engine performance was improved by extending beta(H2). Overall, performance improvement of idling was more effective than that of 3000 rpm. Percent of performance improvement of idling was generally bigger than that of 3000 rpm. Besides, performance improvement by adding H-2 was relatively efficient at low beta(H2), especially below 10%.

AB The diversity of organic fluids and performance criteria has posed a great challenge for engineers to select and evaluate working fluids for organic Rankine cycles (ORCs). To overcome this challenge, this paper reports on second-law-based analytical expressions for thermal efficiency and specific turbine volume (STV), which reveal key dimensionless parameters relating to operating temperatures and thermodynamic properties of organic fluids. A systematic screen was performed to examine more than 70 working fluids involving a wide range of physical and chemical properties. The working-fluid screen confirmed that STV generally increases with critical temperature, reduced ideal gas heat capacity, and the atom number of working fluids. Different-family fluids may lead to ten-fold relative differences in STV even though they have the same atom numbers (e.g., about 200 m(3)/MJ and 20 m(3)/MJ for benzenes and Alkanes, respectively). The thermal efficiency appears to be independent of critical temperature, or at most, a weak function of critical temperature for low boiling-point wet fluids and other halocarbons, partly due to Jacob number that is independent of or depends weakly on the critical temperature of organic fluids such as alkanes, alkenes, and benzenes.

AB Direct methanation of biogas is a promising application of the Power-to-Gas concept, since up to 80% more methane can be produced in comparison to conventional biogas upgrading methods. Six different processes, in which a bubbling fluidized bed or a fixed bed technology serves as the main reactor, were designed, simulated in detail and evaluated in terms of technical feasibility and product gas quality. Both reactor types showed the same chemical performance, since they are both restricted by kinetic and thermodynamic effects. However, the cooled fixed bed reactor requires about three times more catalyst mass than the bubbling fluidized bed. Both methanation technologies did not reach Swiss or German high calorific gas grid requirements in one step. Further upgrading units are necessary which were often not considered in previous literature. Hence, the technological effort for biogas upgrading is higher than often stated in literature. With a subsequent second-stage fixed bed or a gas separation membrane, every process considered reaches the required product gas quality. It is more challenging to fall below the maximum limit of hydrogen (2 vol-%) than to reach the mandatory methane content for grid injection. The electrolysis clearly dominates the power consumption in all processes.

AB Vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) are receiving growing interest for small scale power generation at low wind speed condition, in particular for off-grid, home applications. VAWTs are mainly composed of two typologies: drag-based Savonius, and lift-based Darrieus turbines. Between the two, the Darrieus turbine is the most promising since it is characterized by higher efficiency, even if for applications at higher wind speeds with respect to Savonius VAWTs. A lot of research is made in order to enhance the aerodynamics of the Darrieus rotors, making them applicable for lower wind speeds without significantly affecting efficiency. One of the developments of standard Darrieus configuration is proposed in our previous paper, adopting three couples of blades for the rotor, each composed by a main and an auxiliary aerofoil. A scaled model of such rotor configuration is tested in the wind tunnel available at the Department of Civil and Mechanical Engineering (DICEM) of the University of Cassino, showing good performances in terms of power and torque coefficients, especially at the lower wind speeds. In the present paper, a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes-based CFD model is used in order to investigate the performance of an innovative, real scale double-bladed wind turbine. The CFD model is validated on the basis of the wind tunnel data, and the real scale wind turbine performance is analysed by numerically evaluating the power and torque coefficients. The results of the simulations confirm the capabilities of the proposed configuration to give valuable performance even for wind speeds below 4 m.s(-1).

AB A detailed assessment analysis of 2.5 kWp photovoltaic (PV) system located in southern Algeria (Latitude 27.88 degrees N, Longitude -0.27 degrees E, Altitude 262 m) has been carried out in this paper in order to support the growth of grid-tied photovoltaic power plant implementation in the Saharan environment. The achievement of this analysis has been done by performing an accurate evaluation of the different impacts of the environment parameters on the operating performance of the grid-tied PV system. The data set covers 12 operating months and has been collected by our team from the Research Unit on Renewable Energy (URER-MS). The collected experimental data reveal that the environmental parameters variation has direct effect on the performance of both energy conversion efficiency and system losses. The grid was supplied with a power of 4322.65 kWh during the year 2015, where the annual average temperature was 28.30 degrees C. An important variation in performance parameters have been observed for different months. The yield values of max/min monthly average daily reference, array and final were; 7.68/5.7 kW h/kWp/day, 6.07/4.24 kW h/kWp/day and 5.75/3.98 kW h/kWp/day, respectively. The PV module, inverter and overall system efficiency reached; 14.19/11.10%, 95.34/93.94% and 13.53/10.50%, respectively. The experimental results indicate that the performance ratio (PR) varies from 66.66% to 85.93% and the annual average capacity factor was 7.91%.

AB In this paper a new hybrid method has been implemented by combining Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and a new low rank robust kernel based Extreme Learning Machine (RKELM) for solar irradiation forecasting. This hybrid model presents an efficient and effective short term solar irradiation prediction approach using the historical solar irradiation data. The original non-stationary time series data is decomposed into various modes using VMD approach. The proposed VMD-RMWK (VMD based reduced Morlet Wavelet Kernel extreme learning machine) method is used to predict the solar irradiation of an experimental 1 MW solar power plant in Odisha, India. Different time intervals of 15 min, 1 h and 1 day ahead in different weather conditions are considered for forecasting purpose. The VMD technique decomposes the original nonlinear irradiation into a set of Variational Mode Functions (VMFs), and the extracted VMFs are used to train the kernel based robust ELM. Comparison with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based low rank kernel is also presented in this paper. As a new contribution to the previously performed literature survey this paper presents a more accurate solar irradiation prediction paradigm for distinctive weather conditions, and different time intervals varying from very short duration of 15 min to one day ahead. Also to improve the reliability of the KELM and to make it robust under noisy conditions and the presence of outliers in the data, a weight loss matrix has been derived using a non parametric kernel density estimation method and incorporated in the new formulation (RKELM). A typical solar power experimental solar power station in India has been taken for detailed study showing clearly the accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach. For cross validation of the proposed model, solar irradiation data from a solar power plant located in the state of Florida has been implemented.

AB Although solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks are generally considered promising devices due to their many unique advantages, there are very few experiments and reports on anode support-type SOFC stacks with tubular (T-) designs, since it is quite difficult to determine a proper external air flow path design to support proper air and heat distribution qualities compared with cathode support T-SOFC stacks. In this paper, a large-scale 3D multiphysics model for the external air flow path of a convenient anode support T-SOFC stack is developed for the first time to investigate the general flow distribution characteristics of the external air flow paths. A novel external air flow path for an anode support T-stack is achieved by modifying the main and sub inlet/outlet manifolds, feed/exhaust headers structures and cross-section parameters. This new design is proven to greatly increase the air supply qualities among the tubes and over each tube surface and decrease the temperature gradients in the entire stack. The design could be the proper basic form used for anode support for T-SOFC stacks to achieve good stack performance and duration time in the near future.

AB The main aim of the present research is to effectively utilize the biofuel along with nano additive (Cymbopogon flexuosus biofuel with cerium oxide) powered with a coated and uncoated diesel engine. The work is further extended to study the thermal stress analysis of the coated engine, to empathize the physical mechanism underlying the impact of coated engine on the engine behavior. In connection with this, for the present work, a novel biofuel and oxygenate additive was preferred. Biofuel-Cymbopogon flexuosus was extracted through the steam distillation technique and oxygenate additive - cerium oxide nano additive was synthesized using combustion technique. Focusing on the coating material, YSZ (Yttria-stabilized zirconia) is preferred, as it is highly used in the high-temperature application and were evaluated based on the thermal stress analysis. From the simulation study using FEA (finite element analysis), the average temperature, and thermal stress were higher and heat flux, were noted to be lower for coated piston, confirming the substantial improvement in thermal efficiency in the experimental study. As a next step, YSZ was coated on the engine piston, valves and cylinder head by plasma spray coating technique. From the experimental assessment of test samples such as D-100, B-100, B-25, in a uncoated engine and B-25 + (A) - Cymbopogon flexuosus biofuel - 25% and diesel -75% + 20 ppm cerium oxide nano additive) in a coated and uncoated engine. It was identified that the thermal efficiency of the engine was enhanced by 1.75% as on compared with the conventional engine for the modified fuel blend. In the emission point of view, fuel-based emissions such as hydrocarbon; carbon monoxide and smoke were reduced with a penalty of increased oxides of nitrogen emission.

AB The Waste-to-Energy technology through gasification, pyrolysis, combustion, and digestion has recently turned into an unavoidable alternative for the municipalities in various parts of the World. Besides a considerable reduction in the waste volume, it can generate steam and electricity. In the present work, two techniques (gasification and digestion) are implemented in the Tehran's 3 MW Waste-to-Energy power plant; where these technologies are investigated and compared from the viewpoint of thermodynamics, thermoeconomic, and environmental impacts. Also, multi-objective optimization based on genetic algorithm is applied to find the optimum exergy efficiency and total product unit cost of each model. The input municipal solid waste is converted to a high enthalpy syngas via gasification or biogas via digestion to provide the required heat for steam generation in a Rankine power cycle. The best ranges of the effective parameters in optimal point for both models are obtained from the scattered distribution method. Also, the exergy destruction and the exergetic efficiency of every component is calculated to assess the irreversibilities in the system. Results show that the gasifier and the combustion chamber have the highest exergy destruction in the models (a) and (b). Parametric study and environmental impact analysis indicate that model (b) is the more suitable option from energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, and environmental viewpoints. From the multi-objective optimization results, it is inferred that the exergy efficiency for the model (a) and (b) at the optimum point is 17.98% and 19.02%, respectively while the corresponding total product unit cost is 28.31 $/GJ and 27.68 $/GJ.

AB In this study, the effects of non-uniform magnetic fields on melting and solidification of Nanoparticle-Enhanced Phase Change Materials (NEPCM) in an annulus enclosure are numerically investigated. Magnetic fields are applied on electrically conductive magnetic nanofluids by positioning a wire carrying the electric current in the center of the annulus. For the numerical simulation, a homogenous single-phase model and finite volume method are used and the melting and solidification processes are studied using the enthalpy-porosity method, where, instead of explicitly tracking the liquid-solid interface, the so-called liquid fraction quantity is computed based on the enthalpy balance in each cell and in each time iteration. The results show that, for the case with non-electrical conductive magnetic nanofluids, by increasing the magnetic number, the time required for the melting and solidification processes are reduced up to 39.91% and 14.29%, respectively. However, for the case with electrical conductive magnetic nanofluids at Ra = 10(4) and at specific magnetic numbers, the rate of both melting and solidification processes decreases by increasing the Hartmann number.

AB In this paper, exergy efficiencies, which are effective performance parameters for cryogenic processes, are categorized based on their exergy decomposition levels. However, the existing efficiencies are not standardized for a variety of unit operations. Thus, the extension of the exergy transfer effectiveness (ETE) has been suggested with a general mathematical expression. The extended ETE is defined by decomposing both thermo-mechanical and chemical exergy to the chemical component level. A case study with a complex natural gas liquefaction process and its optimization has also been performed. The results indicate that the extended ETE brings consistent and accurate results for all types of units, also properly reflecting the changes in process performance after optimization. Other efficiencies, however, struggle to measure the performance improvement for some equipment, even showing decreases in their efficiency values.

AB In this work, the effect of using nanoparticles (aluminum oxide (Al2O3), copper oxide (CuO), and copper (Cu)) with a phase change material (PCM) on the performance of a new technique used to improve the working of the air-conditioning (AC) unit is presented. The technique is based on coupling the condenser of the AC unit with a heat exchanger of the cold energy storage PCM. The cold energy storage of the PCM is transferred to the condenser of the AC unit by the cooled ambient air passing through the PCM heat exchanger. The cold energy storage is charged to the PCMs by using the cold ambient air at night during the charging process where the PCMs are solidified during this process. Then, at the next daytime, the charged cold energy storage is discharged by the hot ambient air which is cooled down and transferred to the condenser of the AC unit. The effect of adding the studied nanoparticles on the charging and discharging process of the PCMs, and the performance of the AC unit is studied. The study is carried out at inlet air temperatures to the PCMs of 40 and 45 degrees C and concentrations ratios of the nanoparticles with the PCMs of 1% and 5%. The mathematical model of the physical model is solved numerically by using finite volume method and the numerical model is validated with an experimental setup. The results indicate that, during the discharging process, increasing the inlet air temperature to the PCM decreases the melting time and increases the saving power of the AC unit. Using the nanoparticles with the PCM, and increasing nanoparticles concentration ratio decrease the outlet air temperature, and increase discharging liquid fraction, COP, charging time and saving power of the AC unit. At inlet air temperature 45 degrees C to the PCM, this technique achieves a saving power of the AC unit about 7.18% in case of using PCM without nanoparticles and a saving power 7.41% in case of using Cu nanoparticles with the PCM at concentration ratio 5% compared to conventional AC unit.

AB In order to increase the accuracy and ability to predict the total energy gained in wind farms, it is necessary to use accurate wake models. In the present study, an improved methodology is applied on actuator disc in order to take all the operational and geometrical characteristics into account such as airfoil type, angular velocity, twist, and chord distribution. In wind farms, turbines are affected by upstream ones resulting in a non-uniform upstream velocity for each turbine. However, in literature, for all the wind turbines in a wind farm, thrust coefficient curve at undisturbed wind speed is used in order to estimate the upstream speed resulting in some errors. This weakness of actuator disc is resolved by a hybrid methodology based on blade element momentum theory and mass conservation coupled with computational fluid dynamics to be independent of thrust coefficient curve and calculate more accurate incoming velocity according to operational condition. It has been observed that by using the developed model and considering the details of wind turbines and more accurate incoming wind speed, in spite of steady state simulation and low computational cost, the interaction between different turbines is well described. For turbulence modeling, standard k-epsilon turbulence model is used and it is shown that the error of power estimation in second row of turbines especially in 270 degrees wind angle is decreased significantly. In large wind sectors, such as 270 +/- 10 degrees, +/- 15 degrees, 222 +/- 10 degrees, +/- 15 degrees and 312 +/- 5 degrees, +/- 10 degrees the proposed model performs as well as LES simulation. The developed methodology is practical for designing and optimization of new wind farms even if the technical specifications such as thrust curve would not be available from manufacturer.

TI Theoretical analysis and experimental study of the effect of the neutral

SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
LA English

DE Piezoelectric cantilever; Neutral plane; Output power
ID ENERGY HARVESTER; DESIGN
AB Piezoelectric energy harvesters have been studied extensively because they show considerable promise for use in both military and commercial applications. In this work, research was conducted into the core component of a piezoelectric energy harvester, i.e., the piezoelectric cantilever. The phenomenon where the piezoelectric cantilever has a very low output when no substrate layer is present can be explained using neutral plane theory. The relationship between the neutral planes position and the piezoelectric cantilever's output power can be studied in depth through analysis of this phenomenon. A mathematical model of a vibrating piezoelectric cantilever is established and the neutral plane position and open-circuit voltage of a vibrating piezoelectric cantilever are deduced based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. Calculations and finite element simulation results show that the neutral planes position in the piezoelectric cantilever is dependent on the elastic moduli and thicknesses of the piezoelectric and substrate layers and that the output of the piezoelectric cantilever is also closely related to the neutral plane's position. To study how the neutral plane's position affects the output power of the piezoelectric cantilever, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric cantilevers with different substrate layers but the same piezoelectric layer were fabricated and the output powers of these layers were measured. Experimental results show that the composite piezoelectric cantilever's performance is enhanced in terms of its output voltage, average power and power density as the neutral plane is gradually moved further away from the mid-plane of the piezoelectric layer.

AB In this work, a dynamic model of a high-temperature integrated solar combined cycle power plant is presented. The system includes a three-pressure combined cycle power plant coupled to parabolic trough solar collectors. Thermal storage, a heat solar steam generator, pumps, heat exchangers, and several controllers are also included in the system. Solar energy is used to produce additional steam to be supplied to the steam turbine of the combined cycle power plant. The integrated solar combined cycle system is based on the heat transfer fluid arrangement, exploiting solar energy to produce steam. The analysis is developed by a dynamic simulation model including detailed algorithms for the calculation of the performances of system components. Special control strategies are included in the model in order to accurately manage the steam production of the heat solar steam generator. The paper presents a thermo-economic and environmental comparison between the integrated solar combined cycle and a conventional combined cycle, powered by fossil fuels, based on dynamic simulations. A case study, referred to a plant with a maximum power of around 100 MW, located in Almeria (Southern Spain), is presented and discussed. A parametric analysis was also performed to show the effect of the variation of total solar field reflector area on the system performance. For the case under evaluation, a simple pay-back of 15 years was found, for a solar field aperture area of 80 000 m(2); however, the parametric analysis suggests that a smallest solar field area should be used under the hypotheses of the case study.

AB Background and objectives: Lung resection in patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) is considered when medical therapy alone fails to provide long term control. Data regarding comparative and long-term outcomes are limited. We aimed to review indications and outcomes of adjuvant lung resection for NTM-PD compared with controls.
   Methods: We retrospectively studied 27 surgically treated patients, matched 1:1 for age, sex, NTM species, and radiologic pattern of disease, with control patients treated exclusively with antibiotics.
   Results: In the surgical group, the median (IQR) age was 55 (49-61) years and 74.1% were female. Eighteen patients had Mycobacterium avium complex, and 9 had M. xenopi. Operations included 8 pneumonectomies, 20 lobectomies, one segmentectomy and one lobectomy plus segmentectomy. Post-surgical complications occurred in 6 patients (20%), including 2 acute respiratory distress syndrome, 1 bronchopleural fistula, 1 pericardial tamponade, and 2 empyema. Complications were more common among patients operated upon for progressive disease despite medical therapy (OR 10, p = 0.025). Of 24 matched pairs followed for >= 1 year, sustained culture conversion was observed in 21 (87.5%) patients in the surgical group and in 11 (45.8%) patients in the non-surgical group (RR 2.36, 95%CI 1.37-4.03, p = 0.002). Median (IQR) percentage of follow-up time on antibiotics was 14% (0-100%) in the surgical group and 83% (10.8%-100%) in the non-surgical group (p = 0.195) during a median (IQR) follow-up of 16 (2-36) months.
   Conclusions: NTM-PD patients who underwent adjuvant lung resection experienced significant morbidity and more frequently achieved sputum culture conversion. Long term antibiotic requirements may have been reduced.

AB Objectives: To determine the association between the implementation of the 2006 Australasian Clinical Practice Guidelines for Nutrition in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and the nutritional status of children participating in the Australian Cystic Fibrosis Data Registry (ACFDR).
   Methods: This research consisted of a quantitative study using ACFDR data and a survey of clinicians and dietitians treating children with CF. Two independent cohorts of children (2-5 years and 6-11 years) were selected from ACFDR between 1998 and 2014 (N = 2304). Generalised estimating equation model was used to assess weight, height and body mass index (BMI) z-scores for each patient before and after the implementation of the nutrition guidelines. A nationwide online survey was sent to 48 clinicians to explore the enablers and barriers to implementation of the guidelines.
   Results: Data analysis showed significant increase (p < 0.05) in mean weight, height and BMI z-scores ranging from 0.06 to 0.18 after implementation of the guidelines in both cohorts of children. Nineteen (39%) clinicians participated in the survey. The majority of the respondents adopted the recommendations into their practice and used the guidelines as part of their professional development. Structural barriers included a lack of adequate staff resources and clinic space for consultations, inappropriate staff classification, high staff turnover and lack of mentoring support.
   Conclusion: In children participating in the ACFDR, nutritional status improved after the implementation of the 2006 guidelines. Survey results revealed enablers and barriers to guideline implementation and will inform implementation strategies for the revised Australasian nutrition guidelines for CF, released in 2017.

AB Asthma is a common disease, and although its clinical manifestations may be similar among patients, recent research discoveries have shown that it consists of several distinct clinical clusters or phenotypes, each with different underlying molecular pathways yielding different treatment responses. Based on these observations, an alternative approach - known as 'precision medicine' - has been proposed for the management of patients with severe asthma. Precision medicine advocates identification of treatable traits, linking them to therapeutic approaches targeting genetic, immunological, environmental, and/or lifestyle factors in individual patients. The main "goal" of this personalised approach is to enable choosing a treatment which will be more likely to produce a beneficial response in the individual patient rather than a 'one size fits all' approach. The aim of the present review is to discuss different ways of phenotyping asthma and to provide a rationale for treatment algorithms based on principles of precision medicine.

   ADULTS
AB Background: People with cystic fibrosis (CF) are encouraged to perform airway clearance techniques on a daily basis. Whilst several short-term studies support a potential role for exercise as an airway clearance technique, to date no medium to longer term studies have investigated the use of exercise as a stand-alone airway clearance technique.
   Objective: To determine the feasibility of a protocol investigating the use of exercise as a stand-alone form of airway clearance in adults with CF.
   Methods: Adults with CF and a FEV1 >= 70% predicted were eligible. After a four week wash-in period of daily positive expiratory pressure (PEP) and exercise, adherent participants were randomised to either daily PEP plus exercise or exercise-only for three months. Pre-specified thresholds for feasibility for the primary outcomes were rates of recruitment >= 30%, randomisation >= 80% and completion >= 80%. Secondary outcomes included respiratory function tests, respiratory exacerbation rate and health-related quality of life.
   Results: Of the 57 eligible patients identified, 17 were recruited (30%). After the wash-in period, 13 of the 17 participants (76%) were randomised and all 13 (100%) completed the final assessment. The median (IQR) change in FEV1 (L) over the intervention period was 0.00 (- 0.08 - 0.15) L for the PEP plus exercise group and -0.03 (-0.19 - 0.13) L for the exercise-only group.
   Conclusion: The study achieved its a priori target feasibility rates for recruitment and completion but failed to meet the randomisation target rate. Changes in lung function and quality of life were similar between groups. Further refinement of the protocol may be required prior to expansion to a multi-centred trial.

AB Introduction: The present study examines how trends in the prevalence of asthma during the past three decades associate with hospitalization and mortality during the same period.
   Methods: Altogether 54 320 subjects aged 25-74 years were examined in seven independent cross-sectional population surveys repeated every five years between 1982 and 2012 in Finland. The study protocol included a standardized questionnaire on self-reported asthma, smoking habits and other risk factors, and clinical measurements at the study site. Data on hospitalizations were obtained from the Care Register for Health Care, and data on mortality from the National Causes of Death register.
   Results: During the study, the prevalence of asthma increased - especially in women. In asthmatic compared with non-asthmatic subjects, hospitalization was significantly higher for all causes, respiratory causes, cardiovascular causes and lung cancer. In addition, particularly in asthmatic subjects, mean yearly hospital days in the 5-year periods after each survey diminished. In asthmatic subjects, the decrease in yearly all-cause hospital days was from 4.45 (between 1982 and 1987) to 1.11 (between 2012 and 2015) and in subjects without asthma the corresponding decrease was from 1.77 to 0.60 (p < 0.001). Similarly between 1982 and 2015, COPD hospitalization decreased more in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic subjects. Generally in the present study, all-cause mortality decreased between 1982 and 2015, though mortality in asthmatic subjects compared with non-asthmatics was higher from all causes, respiratory causes and lung cancer.
   Conclusion: There was an increasing trend in the prevalence of asthma and a declining trend in hospitalization, especially in asthmatic subjects.

TI Predicting asthma in older adults on the basis of clinical history

ID BRONCHIAL HYPERRESPONSIVENESS; METHACHOLINE CHALLENGE; RESPIRATORY
   SYMPTOMS; DIAGNOSIS; DISEASE
AB Background: The diagnosis of asthma is not always straightforward and can be even more challenging in older adults. Asthma is ideally confirmed by demonstration of variable expiratory airflow limitation. However, many patients with asthma do not demonstrate airflow obstruction nor show bronchodilator reversibility. We aimed to investigate predictors for a positive bronchial challenge test with methacholine in older adults being evaluated for asthma.
   Methods: This is a diagnostic accuracy study with a cross-sectional design. Participants >= 60 years with suspected asthma and a negative postbronchodilator response on spirometry were included. All participants underwent a methacholine challenge WA (MCT). We assessed the value of standard asthma screening questions and additional clinical questions to predict the MCT results. A multivariable logistic regression model was developed to assess the variables independently impacting the odds of a positive MCT result.
   Results: Our study included 71 participants. The majority were female (n = 52, 73.2%) and the average age was 67.0 years. Those with a positive MCT (n = 55, 77.5%) were more likely to have wheezing or coughing due to allergens (n = 51, 92.7% vs. n = 12, 75.0%; P = 0.004) and difficulty walking several blocks (n = 14, 25.5% vs. n = 1, 6.3%, P = 0.009). After adjustment, having wheezing or coughing due to allergens (OR = 4.2, 95% CI 1.7-7.8, P = 0.012) remained the only significant independent predictor of a positive MCT.
   Conclusions: In older adults with suspected asthma, questioning about wheezing or coughing due to allergens provides a modest independent value to predict a MCT result in those who previously had a negative postbronchodilator response on spirometry.

ID OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; PREVALENCE; BURDEN; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) consists of a combination of classical symptoms and signs, and the evidence of consistent lung function abnormalities. Spiromety has been reported to be underused, possibly for practical difficulties in accessing to a lung function lab. This may lead to misdiagnosis of both asthma and COPD. We aimed to evaluate the frequency of spirometry use and the concordance between doctor-diagnosed asthma and COPD and spirometric patterns, in an unselected cohort of patients sent by general practitioners to perform a spirometry.
   METHODS: The first 300 patients consecutively enrolled patients performed spirometry and bronchodilator test with salbutamol 400 mcg. Demographic, clinical and lung function data have been collected.
   RESULTS: 128 patients (42.7%) declared a doctor-diagnosed asthma and 75 (25%) a doctor-diagnosis of COPD; the remaining subjects never had received any respiratory diagnosis. Only 112 patients with doctor-diagnosed asthma (55.2%) and 114 (56.2%) with doctor-diagnosed COPD have ever performed a spirometry in their entire life (average time since the last spirometry was about 47.0 months). Eighty-nine (69.5%) and 10 (13.3%) patients with respectively doctor-diagnosed asthma and COPD had concordant spirometric patterns with their known diseases.
   DISCUSSION: we described a worrying lack of use of spirometry and a high proportion of misdiagnosis, in patients with suspect chronic airway inflammatory diseases and cared by primary care physicians. Novel strategies to overcome this situation include should be implemented to give a better care to our patients.

   tomography; Survival
ID USUAL INTERSTITIAL PNEUMONIA; HIGH-RESOLUTION CT; PROGRESSION; CRITERIA;
   ABSENCE
AB Background: Whether current diagnostic computed tomography (CT) patterns in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) represent distinct clinical phenotypes or simply temporal evolution of the same underlying radiologic process is unknown. We studied IPF patients presenting with 'possible' or 'inconsistent' usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) CT patterns and characterized the frequency and timing of evolution to 'consistent' UIP and its effect on survival.
   Material and methods: Consecutive IPF patients seen at our institution from 1/1/2005 through 12/31/2013 were assessed for study inclusion. Presenting and serial CT scans were reviewed by two expert radiologists. Baseline and interval clinical data were collated.
   Results: Ninety one patients (mean age 67.4 years, 59% male) met study criteria with 'possible' and 'inconsistent' UIP CT patterns present in 58 (64%) and 33 (36%) cases, respectively. Twenty nine (32%) transitioned to a 'consistent' UIP pattern over a median of 57 months (interquartile range 33-78 months). Decline in pulmonary function was statistically significant on interval follow-up for those with or without pattern evolution, but no different between them in terms of degree. Evolution to 'consistent' UIP did not confer worse survival from the date of disease diagnosis or date of first CT with 'consistent' UIP pattern.
   Conclusions: A portion of IPF patients with initial 'possible' or 'inconsistent' UIP CT pattern will go on to develop 'consistent' UIP CT pattern over months to years. Despite this, there appeared to be similar risk and cause of death in those with or without pattern evolution, suggesting similar morbidity across the radiologic spectrum in IPF.

   EXERCISE; STANDARDIZATION; ASSOCIATION
AB Background: Nutrition is closely related to mortality and pulmonary and respiratory muscle function in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. We initially validated results from a bioelectrical impedance device against dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). We then determined whether fat free mass assessed by a portable impedance device rather than body mass index (BMI) better correlated with pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength and exercise capacity in CF patients.
   Methods: Eighteen young people and adults (median age 19, range 12-39 years) with CF had dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and direct segmental mull-frequency impedance analysis. Body composition, pulmonary function, respiratory muscle function and exercise tolerance using the impedance device were measured in 29 young people with CF with median age 15 (range 12-19) years.
   Main findings: There was a significant correlation between impedance and absorptiometry results (r(2) = 0.947). Fat free mass correlated with the forced vital capacity z-score (r = 0.442, p = 0.016), maximal inspiratory pressure (r = 0.451, p = 0.014) and exercise tolerance (r = 0. 707, p < 0.001). BMI z-scores did not significantly correlate with pulmonary or respiratory muscle function. Subjects with a fat free mass z-score of <= 2 had a lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s z-score (p = 0.007), lower forced vital capacity z-score (p = 0.001), higher residual volume z-score (p = 0.042), lower maximal inspiratory pressure (p = 0.039), more days of intravenous antibiotics per year (p = 0.016) and a higher rate of chronic infections (p = 0.006).
   Principal conclusions: Fat-free mass measured by impedance correlated better with pulmonary and respiratory muscle function and exercise capacity than BMI.

AB Background: Although asthma, rhinitis/rhinosinusitis and peripheral eosinophilia are present in virtually all patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), the role of atopy in these patients is not well defined.
   Objective: To clarify the role of atopy in patients affected with EGPA.
   Methods: Clinical, laboratory and standard spirometry data have been abstracted from medical records. Only patients who underwent skin and/or specific IgE testing for common aeroallergens before the vasculitic phase were included.
   Results: Overall, 33.5% (63) of our patients underwent skin and/or specific IgE testing to aeroallergens. Atopy related to aeroallergens was confirmed in 22.3% (two-third of those tested), and was associated with more severe/uncontrolled asthma (p < 0.001), including a greater use of oral glucocorticoids for respiratory manifestations the year before the diagnosis of EGPA (p = 0.013). Atopic patients with EGPA had higher total serum IgE levels and less renal disease at EGPA diagnosis compared to non-atopic patients (p < 0.05). Among atopic patients, the majority had multiple sensitizations (76%); dust mite and grass pollen were the most common respiratory allergens identified. The number of allergens did not correlate with peripheral eosinophilia, total serum IgE, ESR, or measures of airway obstruction (p > 0.05 in all cases). The presence of atopy increased the risk of severe/uncontrolled asthma, but not the risk of severe vasculitis (Five Factor Score >= 1). Atopic patients had a better overall survival (p = 0.027).
   Conclusion: In EGPA, atopy is associated with better prognosis and more severe/uncontrolled asthma manifestations in the year before the development of vasculitis, but not with more severe vasculitis at presentation.

AB Background: This study assessed patient-level characteristics and patterns of medication use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) before initiation of multiple inhaler triple therapy (MITT; long-acing muscarinic antagonist/long-acting beta(2)-agonist/inhaled corticosteroid [ICS/LAMA/LABA] combination).
   Methods: This retrospective study was conducted using the Optum Research Database. Patients enrolled in commercial or Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans, with a COPD diagnosis and > 1 prescription for a COPD medication between January 2014 and March 2016 were included. The dispensing date for the first pharmacy prescription completing MITT with at least 1 day of overlap was the patient's index date. The 12 months prior to this date were used to assess patient characteristics, exacerbations, eosinophil counts and changes in medication.
   Results: The study population comprised 13,701 patients. At the index date, most patients were using a LAMA (n = 13,353 [97.5%]) and combination ICS/LABA (n = 13,292 [97.0%]) MITT. Overall, 90.4% of patients used a LABA, LAMA, LAMA/LABA, or ICS/LABA or had a moderate or severe exacerbation at any time during the baseline period, indicating that approximately 10% of patients initiated MITT without prior bronchodilator use or exacerbation history. Over 65% of patients with an eosinophil measurement had a value >= 150 cells/mu L.
   Conclusion: Overall, it appears that in this patient population, ICS/LAMA/LABA as triple therapy is being initiated after use of a bronchodilator and/or after an exacerbation event, in accordance with accepted treatment recommendations.

AB Background: Skeletal muscle dysfunction and poor functional capacity are important extra-pulmonary manifestations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), especially in COPD patients on long-term O-2 therapy (LTOT). Beside the role of pulmonary rehabilitation, the effect of nutritional interventions is still controversial, and there are knowledge gaps on the effective role of nutraceutical supplementation on hard endpoints. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of nutritional supplementation with Coenzyme Q10 (QTer (R)) - a powerful antioxidant with the potential to reduce oxidative stress and improve mitochondrial function - and Creatine on functional, nutritional, and metabolomic profile in COPD patients on long-term O-2 therapy.
   Methods: One-hundred and eight patients with COPD from 9 Italian hospitals were enrolled in this double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled clinical study. At baseline and after 2 months of therapy, the patients underwent spirometry, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), bioelectrical impedance analysis, and activities of daily living questionnaire (ADL). Also, dyspnea scores and BODE index were calculated. At both time points, plasma concentration of CoQ10 and metabolomic profiling were measured.
   Findings: Ninety patients, who randomly received supplementation with QTer (R) and Creatine or placebo, completed the study. Compared with placebo, supplemented patients showed improvements in 6MWT (51 +/- 69 versus 15 +/- 91 m, p < 0.05), body cell mass and phase angle, sodium/potassium ratio, dyspnea indices and ADL score. The CoQ10 plasma concentration increased in the supplementation group whereas it did not change in the placebo group. The metabolomics profile also differed between groups. Adverse events were similar in both groups.
   Interpretation: These results show that in patients with COPD, dietary supplementation with CoQ10 and Creatine improves functional performance, body composition and perception of dyspnea. A systemic increase in some anti-inflammatory metabolites supports a pathobiological mechanism as a reason for these benefits. Further trials should help clarifying the role of QTer (R) and Creatine supplementation in patients with COPD.

AB Background: Low-grade systemic inflammation, mainly assessed by C-reactive protein (CRP), has been associated with impaired lung function. Few studies have studied if CRP, blood eosinophils, and blood neutrophils offer additive information in relation to lung function.
   Objectives: To analyse associations between lung function and CRP, blood eosinophils, and blood neutrophils, with special regard to additive information of combining the inflammatory markers.
   Methods: Cross-sectional study on 7753 participants, 20-80 years of age, in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Gender-based tertiles for CRP, blood eosinophils, and blood neutrophils were analysed in relation to the following lung function parameters: forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1% predicted), forced vital capacity (FVC % predicted), and FEV1/FVC ratio.
   Results: CRP, blood eosinophils, and blood neutrophils levels were inversely related to FEV1 and FVC. Only blood eosinophils and blood neutrophils were inversely related to FEV1/FVC ratio. Further, lower lung function was found with increased number of elevated inflammatory markers in the highest tertile (one, two or three vs. non elevated) for FEV1 (beta-coeff., -2.20, -4.43, and -6.43, p < 0.001) and FVC (beta-coeff., -1.70, -3.15 and -5.33, p < 0.001), respectively.
   Conclusions & clinical relevance: CRP, blood eosinophils, and blood neutrophils offer independent and additive information in relation to lower FEV1 and FVC in the general population. This indicates that a combination of biomarkers yields more information than the biomarkers assessed individually.

AB Protein function depends just as much on flexibility as on structure, and in numerous cases, a protein's biological activity involves transitions that will impact both its conformation and its mechanical properties. Here, we use a coarse-grain approach to investigate the impact of structural changes on protein flexibility. More particularly, we focus our study on proteins presenting large-scale motions. We show how calculating directional force constants within residue pairs, and investigating their variation upon protein closure, can lead to the detection of a limited set of residues that form a structural lock in the protein's closed conformation. This lock, which is composed of residues whose side-chains are tightly interacting, highlights a new class of residues that are important for protein function by stabilizing the closed structure, and that cannot be detected using earlier tools like local rigidity profiles or distance variations maps, or alternative bioinformatics approaches, such as coevolution scores.

AB Apolipoprotein-D is a 25 kDa glycosylated member of the lipocalin family that folds into an eight-stranded beta-barrel with a single adjacent a-helix. Apolipoprotein-D specifically binds a range of small hydrophobic ligands such as progesterone and arachidonic acid and has an antioxidant function that is in part due to the reduction of peroxidised lipids by methionine-93. Therefore, apolipoprotein-D plays multiple roles throughout the body and is protective in Alzheimer's disease, where apolipoprotein-D overexpression reduces the amyloid-beta burden in Alzheimer's disease mouse models.
   Oligomerisation is a common feature of lipocalins that can influence ligand binding. The native structure of apolipoprotein-D, however, has not been conclusively defined. Apolipoprotein-D is generally described as a monomeric protein, although it dimerises when reducing peroxidised lipids.
   Here, we investigated the native structure of apolipoprotein-D derived from plasma, breast cyst fluid (BCF) and cerebrospinal fluid. In plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, apolipoprotein-D was present in high-molecular weight complexes, potentially in association with lipoproteins. In contrast, apolipoprotein-D in BCF formed distinct oligomeric species. We assessed apolipoprotein-D oligomerisation using native apolipoprotein-D purified from BCF and a suite of complementary methods, including multi-angle laser light scattering, analytical ultra centrifugation and small-angle X-ray scattering. Our analyses showed that apolipoprotein-D predominantly forms a similar to 95 to similar to 100 kDa tetramer. Small-angle X-ray scattering analysis confirmed these findings and provided a structural model for apolipoprotein-D tetramer. These data indicate apolipoprotein-D rarely exists as a free monomer under physiological conditions and provide insights into novel native structures of apolipoprotein-D and into oligomerisation behaviour in the lipocalin family.

AB Access to streamlined computational resources remains a significant bottleneck for new users of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). To address this, we have developed tools that will submit cryo-EM analysis routines and atomic model building jobs directly to Amazon Web Services (AWS) from a local computer or laptop. These new software tools ("cryoem-cloud-tools") have incorporated optimal data movement, security, and cost-saving strategies, giving novice users access to complex cryo-EM data processing pipelines. Integrating these tools into the RELION processing pipeline and graphical user interface we determined a 2.2 angstrom structure of beta-galactosidase in similar to 55 h on AWS. We implemented a similar strategy to submit Rosetta atomic model building and refinement to AWS. These software tools dramatically reduce the barrier for entry of new users to cloud computing for cryo-EM and are freely available at cryoem-tools.cloud.

AB AAV2.5 represents the first structure-guided in-silica designed Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene delivery vector. This engineered vector combined the receptor attachment properties of AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) with the muscle tropic properties of AAV1, and exhibited an antibody escape phenotype because of a modified antigenic epitope. To confirm the design, the structure of the vector was determined to a resolution of 2.78 angstrom using cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction. The structure of the major viral protein (VP), VP3, was ordered from residue 219 to 736, as reported for other AAV structures, and the five AAV2.5 residues exchanged from AAV2 to AAV1, Q263A, T265 (insertion), N706A, V709A, and T717N, were readily interpretable. Significantly, the surface loops containing these residues adopt the AAV1 conformation indicating the importance of amino acid residues in dictating VP structure.

AB Cleavage of collagen by collagenases such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) is a key step in development, tissue remodeling, and tumor proliferation. The abundant heterotrimeric type I collagen composed of two alpha 1(I) chains and one alpha 2(I) chain is efficiently cleaved by MMP-1 at a unique site in the triple helix, a process which may be initiated by local unfolding within the peptide chains. Atypical homotrimers of the alpha 1(I) chain, found in embryonic and cancer tissues, are very resistant to MMP cleavage. To investigate MMP-1 cleavage, recombinant homotrimers were constructed with sequences from the MMP cleavage regions of human collagen chains inserted into a host bacterial collagen protein system. All triple-helical constructs were cleaved by MMP-1, with alpha 2(I) homotrimers cleaved efficiently at a rate similar to that seen for alpha 1(II) and alpha 1(III) homotrimers, while alpha 1(I) homotrimers were cleaved at a much slower rate. The introduction of destabilizing Gly to Ser mutations within the human collagenase susceptible region of the alpha 2(I) chain did not interfere with MMP-1 cleavage. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated a greater degree of transient hydrogen bond breaking in alpha 2(I) homotrimers compared with alpha 1(I) homotrimers at the MMP-1 cleavage site, and showed an extensive disruption of hydrogen bonding in the presence of a Gly to Ser mutation, consistent with chymotrypsin digestion results. This study indicates that alpha 2(I) homotrimers are susceptible to MMP-1, proves that the presence of an alpha 1(I) chain is not a requirement for alpha 2(l) cleavage, and supports the importance of local unfolding of alpha 2(I) in collagenase cleavage.

AB Fibrin plays a fundamentally important role during hemostasis. To withstand the shear forces of blood flow and prevent embolisation, fibrin monomers form a three-dimensional polymer network that serves as an elastic scaffold for the blood clot. The complex spatial hierarchy of the fibrin meshwork, however, severely complicates the exploration of structural features, mechanical properties and molecular changes associated with the individual fibers of the clot. Here we developed a quasi-two-dimensional nanoscale fibrin matrix that enables the investigation of fibrin properties by topographical analysis using atomic force microscopy. The average thickness of the matrix was 50 nm, and structural features of component fibers were accessible. The matrix could be lysed with plasmin following rehydration. By following the topology of the matrix during lysis, we were able to uncover the molecular mechanisms of the process. Fibers became flexible but retained axial continuity for an extended time period, indicating that lateral interactions between protofibrils are disrupted first, but the axial interactions remain stable. Nearby fibers often fused into bundles, pointing at the presence of a cohesional force between them. Axial fiber fragmentation rapidly took place in the final step. Conceivably, the persisting axial integrity and cohesion of the fibrils assist to maintain global clot structure, to prevent microembolism, and to generate a high local plasmin concentration for the rapid, final axial fibril fragmentation. The nanoscale fibrin matrix developed and tested here provides a unique insight into the molecular mechanisms behind the structural and mechanical features of fibrin and its proteolytic degradation.

AB Coiled coils are well described as powerful oligomerization motifs and exhibit a large diversity of functions, including gene regulation, cell division, membrane fusion and drug extrusion. The archaea S-layer originated right-handed coiled coil-RHCC-NT- is characterized by extreme stability and is free of cysteine and histidine moieties. In the current study, we have followed a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the capacity of RHCC-NT to bind a variety of ionic complex metal ions. At the outside of the RHCC-NT, one mercury ion forms an electrostatic interaction with the S-methyl moiety of the single methionine residue present in each coil. We demonstrate that RHCC-NT is reducing and incorporating metallic mercury in the large-sized interior cavities which are lined up along the tetrameric channel.

AB Snake venom phospholipase A(2)(PLA(2)) has widely been reported to possess antibacterial effects, PLA(2) is the major component of cottonmouth snake venoms. We assessed the antibacterial activities of crude venoms from Western cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma), Eastern cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus), and Florida cottonmouth (Agkisirodon piscivorus conanti) snakes against two gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus), and two gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae) bacteria. Antibacterial activity of PLA(2) proteins, AplAsp49 and AplLys49 purified from A. p. leucostoma venom, was also examined. Disk-diffusion assays revealed that A. p. leucostoma crude venom is most effective in inhibiting the growth of the bacteria tested, compared to the other two. Surprisingly, AplAsp49 and AplLys49 PLA(2)s purified from A. p. leucostoma venom did not display detectable antibacterial activity against any bacteria tested neither by disk-diffusion nor by minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC). The lack of antibacterial activity of cottonmouth venom PLA(2)s is discussed.

AB In fjord systems, Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) not only constitute a serious problem when affecting the wildlife and ecosystems, but also human health and economic activities related to the marine environment. This is mostly due to a broad spectrum of toxic compounds produced by several members of the phytoplankton. Nevertheless, a deep coverage of the taxonomic diversity and composition of phytoplankton species and phycotoxin profiles in HAB prone areas are still lacking and little is known about the relationship between these fundamental elements for fjord ecosystems. In this study, a detailed molecular and microscopic characterization of plankton communities was performed, together with an analysis of the occurrence and spatial patterns of lipophilic toxins in a HAB prone area, located in the Southeastern Pacific fjord region. Microscopy and molecular analyses based on the 18S rRNA gene fragment indicated high diversity and taxonomic homogeneity among stations. Four toxigenic genera were identified: Pseudo-nitzschia, Dinophysis, Prorocentrum, and Alexandrium. In agreement with the detected species, liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry revealed the presence of domoic acid (DA), pectenotoxin-2 (PTX-2), dinophysistoxin-2 (DTX-2), and 13-desmethyl spirolide C (SPX-1). Furthermore, a patchy distribution among DA in different net haul size fractions was found. Our results displayed a complex phytoplankton-phycotoxin pattern and for the first time contribute to the characterization of high-resolution phytoplankton community composition and phycotoxin distribution in fjords of the Southeastern Pacific region.

AB Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most important complications of bothropic poisoning and its early identification remains challenging. The nephrotoxicity of Bothrops insularis venom (BinsV) was previously described by our research group. In this study, we continued to evaluate the effect of BinsV on kidney function in mice and LLC-MK2 proximal tubule cells, evaluating KIM-1 protein as an early AKI biomarker. Male Swiss mice were inoculated with BinsV intramuscularly and observed for 24 h in a metabolic cage model. Urine and blood were collected for biochemical analyses and the kidneys were examined for oxide-reducing balance and submitted to histological analysis. LLC-MK2 cells incubated with BinsV were assessed for cell viability and cell death mechanism by flow cytometry. Histological analysis of the kidneys indicated AM and the oxide-reducing analyses demonstrated a decreasing in reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and an increasing on Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. BinsV was cytotoxic to LLC-MK2 and the cytometry analyses suggested necrosis. Within 24 h after the envenomation, urinary creatinine did not increase, but the urinary levels of KIM-1 increased. In conclusion, we found AKI evidence in the kidney tissue and the increase in the KIM-1 levels suggest it can be used as an early AKI biomarker.

AB Case details: A 51-year-old man presented with rapid onset encephalopathy and respiratory failure after a suspected intravascular envenomation from a North American pit viper. The patient received antivenom and was transferred to a tertiary care facility where he had cardiovascular collapse and persistent coagulopathy requiring 28 vials of Crotalidae polyvalent immune Fab antivenom for initial control and six vials for maintenance. The patient's coagulopathy was monitored using "traditional" measures (platelets, fibrinogen, and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM (R)). The patient also subsequently developed intestinal necrosis requiring exploratory laparotomy with ileum and colonic resections, and anuric renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy. After coordinated multidisciplinary management, he was discharged to an acute inpatient rehabilitation on hospital day 25 and has since made a full recovery.
   Discussion: In the setting of a severe intravascular pit viper envenomation, thromboelastometry correlated well with "traditional" measures. During recovery, ROTEM (R) demonstrated measurable improvements in the extrinsic coagulation pathway while the INR remained between 1.5 and 1.6. Patient's intestinal necrosis may have resulted from microvascular thrombosis due to Crotalinae venom. The patient's ultimate recovery necessitated a coordinated multidisciplinary effort. ROTEM (R) abnormalities after North American pit viper envenomation may be more sensitive than "traditional" measures and may have prognostic value to determine the severity of envenomation, but further research to define its utility is required.

AB This study investigates for the first time in vivo potential release of bound microcystins (MCs) from edible fish tissues. Bound MCs were released in the mouse digestive system and reached the liver (2.1-14.3 ng g(-1)) and blood (1-5 ng ml(-1)). The released MCs were active and negatively affected liver functions of treated mice. The estimated daily intake (EDI) for bound MCs (93.5 mu g kg(-1) day(-1) ) is about 2300 times higher than the WHO safe EDI (0.04 mu g kg(-1) day(-1)), compared to lower EDI for free MCs (0.002 mu g kg(-1) day(-1)). Therefore, bound MCs in fish tissues should be considered when fish are monitored for human consumption.

AB Bactridine 2 (Bact-2) is an antibacterial toxin from Tityus discrepans venom which modifies isoforms 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 voltage-dependent sodium (Na-v) channels. Bactridine-induced Na+ outflow in Yersinia enterocolitica was blocked by amiloride, suggesting that Bact-2 effect was mediated by an amiloride sensitive sodium channel. In this study we show that Bact-2 increases also an outward rectifying current in rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons; therefore, the nature of the outward rectifying currents was characterized and then the effect of Bact-2 on these currents was studied. These currents are enhanced by amiloride, are decreased by Na+ when an outward pH gradient is present and its reversal potential coincides with that of a Cl-/H+ exchanger, suggesting that rectifying currents are produced by the electrogenic Cl-/H+ exchanger modulated by the Na+/H+ antiporter. Bact-2 also leads to an increase of the outward currents in a similar way to the produced by the inhibition of the Na+/H+ exchanger. Additionally, the subsequent application of Bact-2 after blocking the Na+/H+  exchanger does not produce any further effect, suggesting that Bact-2 modifies the outward current by modulating the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger. The effect of Bact-2 on pH, regulation was determined using the pH indicator BCECF. The results show that the Na+ /H(+ )exchanger is blocked by amiloride and Na+ free solutions and is modulated by Bact-2 in a similar way as cariporide. This study validates that besides Na-v channels, Bact-2 modulates the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger.

AB The recent publication of high-throughput transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of scorpion venom glands has increased our knowledge on the biodiversity of venom components. In this contribution, we report the transcriptome of the venom gland and the proteome of the venom for the scorpion species Paravaejovis schwenkmeyeri, a member of the family Vaejovidae. We report 138 annotated transcripts encoding putative peptides/proteins with sequence identity to known venom components available from different databases. A fingerprint analysis containing the molecular masses of 212 components of the whole soluble venom revealed molecular weights of approximately 700 to 13,800 Da, with most detected proteins ranging from 1500 to 3000 Da. Amino acid sequencing of venom components by LC-MS/MS allowed the identification of fragments from 27 peptides encoded by transcripts found in the transcriptome analysis. Enzymatic assays conducted with the soluble venom fraction confirmed the presence of enzymes such as hyaluronidases and phospholipases. The database presented here increases our general knowledge on the biodiversity of venom components from neglected non-buthid scorpions.

AB Snake antivenoms are formulations of animal immunoglobulins used in the treatment of snakebite envenomation. The general scheme for producing snake antivenoms has undergone few changes since its development more than a century ago; however, technological innovations have been introduced in the manufacturing process. These medicines must comply with identity, purity, safety and efficacy profiles, as requested by the current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) applied to modern biopharmaceutical drugs. Industrial production of snake antivenoms comprises several stages, such as: 1) production of reference venom pools, 2) production of hyperimmune plasma, 3) purification of the antivenom immunoglobulins, 4) formulation of the antivenom, 5) stabilization of the formulation, and 6) quality control of in-process and final products. In this work, a general review of the existing technology used for the industrial manufacture of snake antivenoms is presented.

AB In the American continent, larval forms (caterpillars) of the Lonomia genus can cause systemic reactions in human beings. In this Paper, we report the third case of Lonomia envenoming recorded in French Guiana in 25 years, and the first in which specific antivenom was administered. Severe symptoms of the envenoming were observed in our patient including pain;coagulopathy and systemic hemorrhage. They are caused by skin contact with caterpillars. Recovery, however, was quite satisfactory thanks to the international cooperation of the health authorities in both France and Brazil.

AB This case report describes a dog envenomed by a red-bellied black snake (RBBS; Pseudechis porphriacus) that experienced severe and life-threatening haemolysis. The dog presented with hypersalivation, facial swelling, mildly prolonged activated clotting time and the absence of neurological deficits. Envenomation was confirmed by positive identification of the snake and retrospective measurement of RBBS specific venom antigen (24 ng/mL) in serum. The dog was initially hospitalised, treated with intravenous fluids and one vial of tiger-brown snake antivenom which is recommended for RBBS envenomation in Australia. However, after 3.5 d the dog's PCV had declined to 15% and the dog was dull and tachycardic. A second vial of tiger-brown antivenom followed by a packed red blood cell transfusion was administered. A rapid clinical improvement within 12 h was observed. No free RBBS venom was detected in serum at any time point after the first vial of antivenom. Longitudinal haematology and biochemical profiling was performed to 62 d post-envenomation and revealed a gradual recovery in the haematocrit to normal reference range. Spherocyte numbers on blood smear were highest at 5 d post-envenomation and gradually declined to undetectable after 62 d. This case highlights the potential for unpredictable, severe and life-threatening anaemia resulting from RBBS envenomation in dogs.

AB This case report describes the effects of an envenomation from one of the most infrequently encountered species of rattlesnake in the United States, Crotalus willardi willardi (C. w. willardi), the Arizona Ridge-nosed Rattlesnake. A previously healthy 57-year-old male sustained a bite to his non-dominant hand from a C. w. willardi. The most pronounced effect from the envenomation was edema and progression of edema that extended from his hand to the mid bicep. He also experienced erythema and tenderness to palpation in the affected limb, and some diminished range of motion in the hand. He expressed only minimal pain. Other than a mildly positive D-Dimer and leukocytosis, he had no significant hematologic effects and no systemic effects. He was treated with standard doses of Crotalidae Polyvalent Immune Fab (Ovine). He reported complete recovery from the envenomation within three days of the bite.
   Although envenomation from rattlesnakes is somewhat common in Arizona, knowing the exact species of snake is not. Confirmed documentation is exceedingly rare as most people do not recognize the different rattlesnake species. In addition, some species of rattlesnake (such as C. w. willardi) are especially reclusive and found only in isolated mountainous regions. Being able to confirm an envenomation by C. w. willardi would require not only someone knowledgeable in herpetology, but also, preferably, photographic evidence. This case has both.

AB SaPLI gamma is a natural phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) inhibitor, isolated from Sinonatrix annularis, that has been demonstrated to protect against envenomation by other venomous snakes. As snake venom PLA(2)s and mammalian secretory PLA(2)s are similar, saPLI gamma is thought to have potential to alleviate inflammatory reactions in which PLA(2)s act as a key enzyme for arachidonic acid release. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and mechanisms of action of saPLI gamma in an animal model of carrageenan-induced acute inflammation. The results indicated that saPLI gamma inhibited PLA(2) subtypes extensively, especially IIA-PLA(2), in a dose-dependent manner. Paw swelling in mice was reduced markedly by intraperitoneal saPLI gamma 2.5 mg/kg, and the effect was significantly better than observed with dexamethasone at the same dose. Lower neutrophil infiltration and tissue edema was observed in the paws of saPLI gamma-treated mice. Additionally, carrageenan-induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF alpha and IL-1 beta) were also significantly downregulated by saPLI gamma in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggested that saPLI gamma had effective anti-inflammatory effects in vivo, and these were produced by blocking mammalian IB, IIA, V and X sPLA2 subtypes.

AB In millions of years, spiders have optimized their venoms in order to assure successful prey capture and defence against predators. Spider venoms have become unique cocktails of biological active components enabling potentially interesting application for drug discovery or for agricultural purposes. The venom of Phoneutria nigriventer has been studied for over 60 years. This spider is responsible for a high number of envenomations with severe clinical manifestations in humans, which necessitates a comprehensive knowledge of its venom composition. With over 40 different neurotoxic peptides characterized so far and still many more awaiting identification, this venom is undoubtedly a pharmacological treasure. This review provides an overview of the Phoneutria nigriventer toxins known today and describes their mechanism of action at a molecular level. We critically discuss the potential of the Phoneutria nigriventer venom peptides as pharmaceutical tools or lead compounds for drug development.

AB A study was conducted to determine the effects of zearalenone (ZEN) on the mRNA expression of pregnane X receptor (PXR), constitutive and rostane receptor (CAR), and phase I and II enzymes as well as the toxicity in the liver of female weanling piglets. Thirty-two female weanling piglets (Duroc x Landrace x Large white, 12.27 +/- 0.30 kg)were divided into four groups (n = 8 piglets/group) that were supplemented with 0 (control), 0.5, 1 or 2 mg/kg ZEN. The trial period lasted for 28 d. The results showed that the ZEN supplementation in the diets (0.5-2 mg/kg) had no effect on growth performance but dose-dependently increased serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanineaminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase activities (P < 0.05). The ZEN residue in the liver (P < 0.01) was also linearly and dose-dependently increased. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of PXR, CAR, phase I enzymes (i.e., cyp2el, cyp3a5, cyp2a6, cyp1a1, and cyp1a2), and phase II enzymes (i.e., gsta1, gsta2, ugt1a3) significantly increased linearly in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). However, the spleen relative weight and the glutathione peroxidase activity in the liver (P < 0.05) linearly decreased as the dietary ZEN concentration increased; the mRNA expression of the nuclear receptors PXR and CAR is responsive to ZEN in female piglets, and ZEN increases the mRNA expression of their target genes. This finding shows that the nuclear receptor signaling system plays an important role in the defense against ZEN.

AB The compulsive and insidious secondary metabolite aflatoxin B-1, produced by the opportunistic fungi Aspergillus flavus, upholds a distinguished place in midst of the toxicants causing fatal hazards to humans. Aflatoxins alter the function of host cells by inducing multiple effects through genetic and non-genetic pathways. Epigenetic mechanisms drag major attention towards finding novel and new mechanisms involved in this process. Our present work intends to study the functional expression profile of multiple epigenetic regulators. AFB i modulates multiple epigenetic regulators like DNA methyltransferases (DMNTs), histones modifying enzymes and polycomb proteins. AFB(1) upregulates the expression of DNMTs at gene and protein level in a dose dependent manner. It reduced the histone acetyl transferase (HAT) activity significantly with a remarkable increase in histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity along with an induction in expression of HDACs gene and protein in a dose dependent manner. The gene and protein expression of polycomb repressor proteins B cell specific moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (BMI-1) and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) was significantly over expressed with enhanced trimethylation of H3K27 and ubiquitination of H2AK119. In summary, our results show impact of aflatoxin B-1 on multiple epigenetic modulations known to be pivotal in oncogenic processes.

AB In recent years, the neurotoxin beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) has been reported in some marine mollusk species. To further discover BMAA in marine animals, a total of 59 samples belonging to 3 phyla, 22 families, and 43 species, were collected from Dalian, Rongcheng, and Zhoushan cities, China, in April 2017. All samples were quantified by a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS) analysis of underivatized extract, and ten samples were also analyzed by a liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis using a precolumn AQC (6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate)-derivatization method. Results indicated that 48 mollusk samples contained BMAA with concentrations above the limit of detection (0.31 mu g g(-1) wet weight), and the isomers of BMAA, beta-amino-Nmethylalanine (BAMA) and 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (DAB) were universally present in most samples. However, N-(2-aminoethyl) glycine (AEG) was not found in any sample. Comparison of both analytical methods showed that BMAA and BAMA were not completely separated by the HILIC column although they still could be identified by specific transitions. In contrast the C-18 column provided good separation for the AQC-derivatives of BMAA and all of its isomers. Development of analytical methods and stable isotope tracing of BMAA should be carried out in the future.

AB Scorpions are an ancient and diverse venomous lineage, with over 2200 currently recognized species. Only a small fraction of scorpion species are considered harmful to humans, but the often life-threatening symptoms caused by a single sting are significant enough to recognize scorpionism as a global health problem. The continued discovery and classification of new species has led to a steady increase in the number of both harmful and harmless scorpion species. The purpose of this review is to update the global record of medically significant scorpion species, assigning each to a recognized sting class based on reported symptoms, and provide the major toxin classes identified in their venoms. We also aim to shed light on the harmless species that, although not a threat to human health, should still be considered medically relevant for their potential in therapeutic development. Included in our review is discussion of the many contributing factors that may cause error in epidemiological estimations and in the determination of medically significant scorpion species, and we provide suggestions for future scorpion research that will aid in overcoming these errors.

TI Fenestrated T-bar Clips in Surgical Management of Internal Carotid
   Artery Aneurysms: Technical Note
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Aneurysm; Fenestrated clip; Internal carotid artery; T-bar clip
AB BACKGROUND: Using a conventional right-angled fenestrated clip for an internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm is potentially disadvantageous because of the worse surgical visibility during and after clip application, especially in tight surgical fields.
   METHODS: We report a case of ruptured posteromedially projecting ICA aneurysm treated using a right-angled fenestrated T-bar clip (Yasargil titanium clip, Aesculap AG & Co, Tuttlingen, Germany). A 52-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with severe headache. Three-dimensional computed tomography angiography showed a saccular aneurysm arising from the left, unusually short ICA, located proximal to the anterior choroidal artery. The right-angled fenestrated T-bar clip (blade length, 5 mm) was applied across the ICA, followed by reconstruction of the ICA wall with preservation of the anterior choroidal artery and simultaneous obliteration of the aneurysm.
   RESULTS: The key characteristic of the fenestrated T-bar clip is that the fenestrated portion of the clip is connected to the center of the blades. The tips of the blades on both sides are thus clearly visible during clip application.
   CONCLUSIONS: Application of the T-bar clip allows the surgeon to perform clip ligation of a posteromedially projecting ICA aneurysm while preserving the adjacent perforating artery.

   PITUITARY-ADENOMAS; NEURALGIA; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: The trigeminocardiac reflex (TCR) is characterized by bradycardia, decrease of mean arterial blood pressure, and sometimes, asystole during surgery. We critically reviewed TCR studies and devised a novel classification scheme for assessing the reflex.
   METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature review was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Scielo databases. Eligible studies were extracted based on stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria. Statistical analyses were used to assess cardiovascular variables. TCR was classified according to morphophysiologic aspects involved with reflex elicitation.
   RESULTS: A total of 575 patients were included in this study. TCR was found in 8.9% of patients. The reflex was more often triggered by interventions made within the anterior cranial fossa. The maxillary branch (type II in the new classification) was the most prevalent nerve branch found to trigger the TCR. Heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure were similarly altered (P = 0.06; F = 0.3912809), covaried with age (P = 0.012; F = 9.302), and inversely correlated to each other (r = -0.27).
   CONCLUSIONS: TCR is a critical cardiovascular phenomenon that must be quickly identified and efficiently classified and should trigger vigilance. Prompt therapeutic measures during neurosurgical procedures should be carefully addressed to avoid unwanted complications. Accurate categorization using the new classification scheme will help to improve understanding and guide the management of TCR in the perioperative period.

AB BACKGROUND: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and percutaneous kyphoplasty are 2 common procedures that could be applied simply in treatment of vertebral compression fractures. Despite simplicity and safe application of these procedures, there are some drawbacks as well. Cement leakage into the spinal canal is the most common complication of PVP and PKV procedures. The aim of this article is to present a minimally invasive alternative technique for removing cement leakage fragment after the PVP.
   METHODS: A 44-year-old female patient began to complain of L4 radiculopathy after L4 PVP. The lumbar computed tomography demonstrated cement fragment closed to upper medial aspect of the left L4 pedicle. A minimally invasive translaminar endoscopic procedure was performed to remove the cement fragment.
   RESULTS: Following the endoscopic procedure, the patient's complaints resolved completely and she was discharged on postoperative day 1. The minimally invasive intervention provided shorter operation time, minimal blood loss, and reduced complication rate due to its simplicity. In particular, there was no need to undergo general anesthesia.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic translaminar approach could be safely performed in patients with symptomatic cement leakage after PVP or a percutaneous kyphoplasty procedure.

LA English
DT Article

   Radiotherapy; Stereotactic radiosurgery
ID BRAIN-TUMORS; RADIOTHERAPY; HEMANGIOMA; DIAGNOSIS; SURVIVAL
AB BACKGROUND: Extravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia (EPEH) is an extremely uncommon form of papillary endothelial hyperplasia characterized by an exuberant reactive endothelial proliferation in areas of extravascular hemorrhage rather than within the vascular lumen. Intracranial EPEH is known to develop after radiosurgery in patients with intracranial neoplasms, suggesting a causative relationship between radiotherapy and the development of EPEH. Intracranial EPEH is typically treated with surgical resection; to date, there have been no reported cases of EPEH recurrence after gross total resection.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 75-year-old man with a history of atypical meningioma presented to our hospital with progressive right upper and lower extremity weakness. Eight and a half years before admission, he had undergone surgical resection and stereotactic radiosurgery for a World Health Organization grade II meningioma. Several years later, he experienced a mass in the prior resection cavity and was subsequently treated with gross total resection and cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds. Postoperative pathologic examination of the resected tissue at that time showed EPEH with no evidence of recurrent atypical meningioma. On this admission, magnetic resonance imaging showed a recurrent mass in the area of prior resection, at which time the patient underwent a third craniotomy and gross total resection. Postoperative histopathologic examination showed findings consistent with the diagnosis of recurrent EPEH.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case report is the first known recurrence of intracranial EPEH occurring after gross total resection and brachytherapy.

ID CEREBELLAR MEDULLOBLASTOMA; NONMETASTATIC MEDULLOBLASTOMA; CHEMOTHERAPY;
   RADIOTHERAPY; CHILDHOOD; SUBGROUPS; SURVIVAL; OUTCOMES; RISK
AB BACKGROUND: Medulloblastoma is a malignant tumor of the posterior fossa and is predominantly seen in children younger than 15 years of age. This tumor is uncommon in adults, especially those older than 40 years of age, and reports of cases in patients older than 60 years of age are particularly rare. Although surgery and radiotherapy play important roles in treatment of medulloblastoma in adults, addition of chemotherapy is controversial, especially prior to radiotherapy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a 63-year-old woman with an atypical medulloblastoma in the cerebellum and a lesion in the suprasellar area that did not appear to be a metastasis of the medulloblastoma. The patient underwent a subtotal resection of the cerebellar medulloblastoma, which was classified histologically as classic subtype and molecularly as non-Wingless/non-Sonic hedgehog subtype in World Health Organization 2016 classification. Then she underwent postoperative chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. We administered chemotherapy to facilitate therapeutic diagnosis of the suprasellar lesion. The combination treatment resulted in the disappearance of the cerebellar medulloblastoma with treatment toxicity well tolerated. Additionally, the suprasellar lesion remains under control.
   CONCLUSIONS: Even in adults over 60 years of age, medulloblastoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of a cerebellar mass. Chemotherapy for adult medulloblastoma has the potential to be efficacious and tolerable.

ID ISCHEMIC-STROKE; BRAIN-STEM; CONVULSIONS; FEATURES; THERAPY
AB BACKGROUND: Basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is a rare, potentially fatal cause of ischemic stroke. It is often challenging to diagnose, especially when the presenting symptom is "seizures". We present 3 cases of patients with BAO presenting with seizures.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The first patient was a 53-year-old man with clonic convulsions. On angiography, BAO was detected and mechanical thrombectomy (MT) was performed. The modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months after treatment was 1. The second patient was a 64-year-old man with generalized convulsions. He was diagnosed with BAO and vertebral artery dissection and was treated with MT, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, and stenting. The modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months after treatment was 3. The third patient was a 77-year-old man with tonic convulsions. He was diagnosed with BAO and treated with MT. However, he did not survive.
   CONCLUSIONS: BAO is devastating; however, it is a treatable disease. Our report suggests that BAO should be suspected in patients presenting with initial convulsive seizures.

DT Article
DE Ganglioneuroma; Lumbar spine; Resective surgery; Residual tumor;
   Surgery; Treatment
ID MALIGNANT-TRANSFORMATION; NEUROBLASTOMA; FEATURES; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Ganglioneuroma (GN) is a slow-growing tumor originating from the neural crest-derived cells, which form the sympathetic nervous system. These tumors can affect anywhere along the peripheral autonomic ganglion sites and are most commonly found in the mediastinum and retroperitoneum. Spinal GNs are extremely rare and, so far, only 1 case arising from a lumbar nerve root has been reported in the English literature. GNs are often asymptomatic, and the majority of them are found incidentally in healthy subjects. Because of their slow growth, symptoms may result from the compressive effect of the tumor.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 40-year-old man presented with a right sciatica episode accompanied by global muscle weakness and tingling pain. Findings of the neurologic examination displayed positive Lasegue test and sensory deficit over L5-S1 dermatomes. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine without contrast showed a well-circumscribed longitudinal lesion arising from L5-S1 disc space, moving us toward a diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation. During surgery, we observed a mass well-encapsulated and oval-shaped inside S1 right root. The patient underwent subtotal resection. Histopathologic examination showed clusters of ganglion mature cells with neuromatous stroma, consistent with a ganglioneuroma.
   CONCLUSIONS: We report a case that illustrates the clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic features of a ganglioneuroma mimicking a lumbosciatica syndrome and review related literature and similar cases.

   TECHNICAL NOTE; RESECTION; INJURY; PRESSURE; GLIOMAS
AB BACKGROUND: Retraction-related injury is a recognized complication in neurosurgery. Use of tubular retractors that distribute the pressure on brain tissue was introduced to minimize brain injury. We developed a modified technique using a simple plastic syringe with a Foley catheter to achieve atraumatic cannulation in accessing deep lesions.
   METHODS: A retrospective pilot study was conducted to assess safety of the syringe transtubular technique for accessing deep lesions as a cost-effective substitute for commercial brain port methods and to identify retraction-related injury using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging postoperatively. Nine patients were operated on using the syringe technique. Lesions selected were intraparenchymal, deeply located in the supratentorial compartment. Lesions were located in the insula (n = 2), thalamus or basal ganglia (n = 5), subcortical frontoparietal (n = 1) lobe, and right temporal lobe (n = 1). Patients with hematomas, intraventricular lesions, superficially located lesions; pediatric patients less than 12 years old; and patients undergoing redo surgeries were excluded.
   RESULTS: Surgical goals were achieved in 8 patients. Three patients had transient deficits; one patient had significant morbidity, which was diagnosed postoperatively as toxoplasmosis. Diffusion restriction was noted in all patients at the surgical cavity but not in the cannulation path.
   CONCLUSIONS: Transtubular approaches have a good safety profile and can help achieve surgical goals. Larger studies are needed to compare this approach with other methods, including its effect on hospital stay and survival. The syringe technique is an alternative safe method that can be used in certain neurosurgical centers where commercial tube systems are unavailable.

AB Multimodal neuromonitoring has become a fundamental part of management for many neurosurgical disorders such as subarachnoid hemorrhage and severe traumatic brain injury. Brain tissue oxygen tension monitoring requires insertion of a probe into the brain parenchyma through a single multiple lumen bolt, or in a subcutaneously tunneled fashion. As those patients often require early magnetic resonance imaging, typically using bolts is disadvantageous due to massive metal artifact. Similarly, subcutaneous tunneling is often problematic as suture fixation can loosen over time. We hereby report a new method of fixation of the Licox brain tissue oxygenation probe with 1 or 2 3-way taps that are attached to a standard plastic cannula, resulting in a stable connection with no need for further direct sutures around the probe and above all with no metal artifacts, which negates magnetic resonance imaging. The extended fixation system was first tested with cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a brain injured porcine model. It was thereafter adopted in our daily clinical practice.

AB BACKGROUND: Primary dystonia is a neurologic disease with characteristics of abnormal, involuntary twisting and turning movements, which greatly affect quality of life of patients. Treatments for dystonia consist of oral medications, botulinum neurotoxin injections, physical therapy, and surgery. For medication-refractory dystonia, surgery, especially deep brain stimulation (DBS), is the optimal option.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 13-year-old boy suffering from extremely severe primary dystonia, with a Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale-motor score of 118 and a Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale-severity score of 29. The examination of 173 genes, including DYT, failed to identify any abnormality. He responded ineffectively to medications. After both bilateral subthalamic nucleus DBS and unilateral thalamic lesion in ventralis intermedius nucleus and ventralis oralis nucleus (Vim-Vo thalamotomy), his movement disorder improved dramatically. Four and 7 months after the operation, the scores of 2 rating scales sharply decreased. Potential brain structural changes were reflected in sensorimotor-related cortical thickness, surface area, and gray matter volume from magnetic resonance imaging, which may reveal a valid method to evaluate surgical effect on the brain with enough patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: DBS and thalamotomy is potentially an effective combination of treatments for severe medication-refractory dystonia.

ID SURGICAL RESECTION; CLINICAL ARTICLE; TUMORS; LIMITATIONS
AB BACKGROUND: Delayed infarction in the lenticulostriate artery (LSA) area after insular glioma resection is not common, and its pathophysiology remains unknown.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 32-year-old right-handed man with a giant insular low-grade glioma with frontal and temporal extension underwent awake craniotomy with an intentional staged surgery strategy. Preoperative radiologic images demonstrated a diagonally elevated middle cerebral artery (MCA) by the temporal tumor and a significantly compressed striatum. With intraoperative subcortical direct electrical stimulation, the resection was finalized in the temporal part of the tumor due to the semantic paraphasia induced in the temporal stem, fatigue, and loss of concentration. The immediate postoperative clinical course was uneventful. However, on postoperative day 20, he suddenly experienced right hemiparesis. Repeated images revealed infarction in the LSA area. The previously compressed striatum was then relieved and relocated to its original position in just 20 days, and the M1 segment of the MCA was remarkably downward, in which the MCA resembled a hammock. Angiography confirmed the hammock-shaped MCA and significantly stretched LSA, suggesting the combination of freed striatum from the compression and loss of temporal structure by the tumor resection as the key mechanism of severe dislocation of the MCA and delayed ischemia.
   CONCLUSIONS: In a staged resection of giant insular glioma, attention should be paid to a possible severe dislocation of the MCA in a delayed postoperative period, which may lead to LSA stretching and delayed infarction.

TI Giant Serpentine Aneurysm of the Middle Cerebral Artery
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Clinicopathologic characteristics; Giant serpentine aneurysm; Mechanism
ID INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSM; MECHANISM; FUSIFORM
AB BACKGROUND: Giant serpentine aneurysms (GSAs) are a subgroup of giant intracranial aneurysms, distinct from saccular and fusiform varieties, that are defined as partially thrombosed giant aneurysms with tortuous internal vascular channel. Clinicopathologic characteristics of middle cerebral artery GSAs have been rarely reported in the literature, with discussion of radiologic characteristics only. We clarify patient clinical and neuroradiologic features and discuss the mechanism of formation and progression.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 43-year-old woman presented with a GSA arising from the middle cerebral artery. There was a separate inflow and outflow channel of the aneurysm, with the outflow channel feeding the distal branches of the parent artery and supplying normal brain parenchyma. The GSA was treated successfully by aneurysmectomy and superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass followed by proximal occlusion and vascular reconstruction. An aneurysm specimen was examined to correlate pathologic findings and morphologic characteristics.
   RESULT: Pathologic results showed that thickness of the aneurysmal wall was typically increased and varied, and no internal elastic lamina or endothelial lining could be identified. The sac contained thrombi of various ages with recanalizing vessel formation and chronic inflammation infiltration. Intimal hyperplasia and neoangiogenesis in the wall and hyaline degeneration of the media were observed. Vessels coursing in their adventitia showed mucoid changes, which are responsible for the contrast enhancement of the aneurysmal rim on computed tomography scan.
   CONCLUSIONS: GSAs are a specific pathologic entity with unique morphologic and pathologic characteristics that can affect intracranial blood vessels. The pathogenic mechanisms are unclear; this report suggests that GSAs may be associated with degeneration of the vascular wall.

AB BACKGROUND: Intradiploic epidermoid cyst (IEC) concurrent with chronic epidural hematoma (CEDH) has never been reported in the literature. We report a unique case of IEC concurrent with anatomically close associated CEDH.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 54-year-old man presented with a 1-week history of headache, confusion, and drowsiness. Computed tomography exposed large, extraaxial, mixed-density lesions with bone destruction and substantial mass effect in the left frontotemporal region. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed 2 adjacent extraaxial lesions. The frontal lesion was predominantly hyperintense on both T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), with an enhancement rim of the thickened dura mater. The frontotemporal lesion was mainly hyperintense on both TlWI and T2WI, with some areas of hypointensity on both T1WI and T2WI. No enhancement in the lesion was found. The patient underwent left frontotemporal craniotomy for resection of the lesion. At the time of the craniotomy, a copious amount of yellow liquid outflowed. After the bone flap was removed, an irregular tumor was found epidurally located and composed of fragile and laminated yellow materials. The tumor was totally removed. Histologic examination revealed an epidermoid cyst. Postoperative computed tomography showed mild bleeding in the operation area. His symptoms improved significantly after surgery, and he was discharged 1 week later. At 2 weeks' follow-up, the patient was well without neurologic deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intradiploic epidermoid cyst concurrent with chronic epidural hematoma is extremely rare. We present the first case of intradiploic epidermoid cyst concurrent with anatomically close associated chronic epidural hematoma.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical outcomes and postoperative complications between open-door laminoplasty (ODL) versus French-door laminoplasty (FDL) for the treatment of cervical multilevel compressive myelopathy.
   METHODS: We comprehensively searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure to identify relevant articles. The search results were last updated on January 1, 2018. All values of weighted mean difference (WMD) and odds ratio are expressed as ODL relative to FDL.
   RESULTS: Six studies containing 430 patients were included in our meta-analysis. In randomized controlled trials, there was no significant difference in Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores between ODL and FDL groups (WMD, 0.06; 95% confidence limits [CL], -0.52 to 0.64; P = 0.84). However, in the retrospective trials, JOA scores were significantly higher in the ODL group than in the FDL group (WMD, 0.95; 95% CL, 0.55-1.34; P < 0.05). The pooled data showed that the magnitude of spinal canal expansion in the ODL group was higher than in the FDL group (WMD, 24.39%; 95% confidence interval, 12.33-36.45; P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis showed that the magnitude of canal expansion was higher with ODL than with FDL. There is a lack of compelling evidence to prove the superiority of one procedure over the other.

AB It is a common assumption that the human skull and solid skull implants are impermeable to diagnostic ultrasound. We demonstrated in 2 patients that frontoparietal polyetheretherketone cranioplasties allowed useful imaging of intracranial parenchymal and vascular structures with higher ultrasound frequencies than the 2 MHz used for the temporal bone window.
   This knowledge about additional imaging properties may be helpful in emergency situations and for vascular monitoring. The decision for a polyether ether ketone cranioplasty may contribute to patient safety.

AB BACKGROUND: Endoscopic surgery for lumbar stenosis is gaining acceptance because of the minimal muscle damage, short recovery times, reduced blood loss, and good clinical results. We report a novel technique of decompressing contralateral traversing and exiting nerve roots through a single interlaminar window, avoiding separate incision for foraminal decompression with minimal damage to facet joints and comparing morphometric changes after decompression.
   METHODS: Between March and December 2017, 30 patients were evaluated retrospectively for clinical, radiologic, and morphometric outcomes. Patients with unilateral radiculopathy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing spinal stenosis at 2 levels (lateral recess and cranial level foraminal compression) were included. Clinical evaluation used a numerical rating scale (NRS) for leg pain and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, and radiologic evaluation used MRI. For morphometric analysis, the cross-sectional area of the intervertebral foramen (CSA-IVF), spinal canal (CSAC), and facet joint (CSA-FJ) was measured on MRI.
   RESULTS: Thirty levels were decompressed (no adverse events). NRS leg pain and ODI scores improved from 7.5 +/- 0.86 and 67.9 +/- 9.7 preoperatively to 1.53 +/- 0.86 and 15.7 +/- 6.6 at last follow-up, respectively. CSAC improved from 99.34 +/- 34.01 to 186.83 +/- 41.41, indicating good canal decompression. CSA-IVF improved from 56.40 +/- 19.28 to 97.60 +/- 28.46, indicating good foraminal decompression. CSA-FJ improved from 231.37 +/- 62.53 to 194.96 +/- 50.56, indicating good foraminal decompression with less damage to facet joint. Morphometric changes were statistically significant (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Biportal endoscopic decompression of the lateral recess and cranial foramen through a single interlaminar window can be performed using a contralateral approach. In view of the good clinical and radiologic outcomes of patients, with notable improvements in morphometric measurements at stenosed segments, this surgical technique is worthy of further evaluation and application.

AB BACKGROUND: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis that primarily affects the coronary artery, but it does not commonly affect the carotid artery. Cerebral infarction (CI) with internal carotid artery stenosis (ICS) in patients with KD has not been reported until now. We report a patient with CI as a remote-phase complication of KD.
   CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old man presented with impaired consciousness. Magnetic resonance imaging and digital subtraction angiography confirmed CI and ICS. He successfully underwent carotid endarterectomy. The resected plaque had pathologic findings of KD, which suggested that the internal carotid artery suffered from chronic inflammation.
   CONCLUSION: KD in childhood may cause symptomatic ICS as a sequela of a remote phase.

   CHEMOTHERAPY; CHILDREN; FEATURES
AB BACKGROUND: Germinomas are rare malignant central nervous system tumors, a type of germ cell tumor, according to the 2016 World Health Organization Classification of Brain Tumors. Most of these tumors develop along the midline, most often from the pineal gland, followed by tumors arising in the suprasellar cisterns. Suprasellar germinomas commonly manifest with diabetes insipidus, visual impairment, and hypothalamic-pituitary failure. We present a literature review from the PubMed database and report 2 cases of suprasellar germinomas.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Both pediatric patients presented with progressive visual loss; one did not show endocrinologic impairment, and the other presented with hypothyroidism, diabetes insipidus, and generalized edema. Magnetic resonance imaging showed expansive suprasellar masses in both cases, confirmed as germinomas at histopathologic examination. The patients were treated with the same surgical approach, although their outcomes were different because of endocrinologic and post surgical complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Suprasellar germinomas are highly curable lesions when diagnosed early. The treatment remains controversial and should be individualized, but the association of chemotherapy and radiotherapy allows reduce adverse effects and shows great results.

ID LEPTOMENINGEAL DISSEMINATION; MULTICENTRIC GLIOMA; SPINAL-CORD; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) has been identified as a predisposing factor in the development of pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), a common benign central nervous system tumor. Although this is a common association, simultaneous development of multiple lesions is an infrequent finding, especially in nonoptic and hypothalamic locations.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 41-year-old female patient with NF1 and uncontrolled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 infection presented with a first generalized seizure and associated headache and ataxia. Imaging studies revealed 2 large intra-axial PAs, nodular-cystic in the supratentorial compartment and solid in the infratentorial compartment. Both lesions were treated by gross total resection in 2 surgeries performed 1 week apart. Despite their different imaging patterns, the tumors were histologically and genetically identical.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present a unique case involving 2 histologically and genetically identical PAs occurring simultaneously in supratentorial and infratentorial locations. We suggest that an intrinsic predisposition to tumor development in patients with NF1 might have been enhanced by the HIV-related immunosuppression in this case. Strict oncologic surveillance is essential in patients with a tumor predisposition syndrome combined with immunosuppression.

TI Low-Grade Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor Mimicking Schwannoma:
   Role and Importance of Trimethylated H3K27M Staining
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE H3K27M; MPNST; Schwannoma; Transformation; Trimethylated
ID TRANSFORMATION
AB BACKGROUND: It is important to differentiate low-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) from benign nerve sheath tumors as MPNSTs may require a more aggressive treatment strategy during and after initial resection. Loss of expression of the trimethyl histone H3 at the Lys27 position (H3K27-me3) has recently been described in MPNSTs and may help distinguish this tumor from pathologic mimics.
   METHODS: A 43-year-old woman presented with symptoms of radiculopathy and a history of pelvic radiation for cervical cancer 7 years prior. Imaging and surgical pathology were initially consistent with an L5 schwannoma including spindle morphology without mitoses and retained S100 expression. After an aggressive recurrence 11 months later, pathology was consistent with highgrade MPNST including heightened mitotic activity and loss of S100 expression.
   RESULTS: After the identification of MPNST, H3K27M me3 immunostaining was applied to both the initial and recurrent pathologic specimens. The initial specimen demonstrated patchy loss of H3K27M me3 expression, more consistent with low-grade MPNST than schwannoma.
   CONCLUSION: This case highlights the role of H3K27M me3 immunostaining to help differentiate MPNSTs that may mimic more benign nerve sheath tumors, especially in patients who have a history of radiation to the region in question.

DT Article
DE Dorsal motor nucleus; Gastroparesis; Fourth ventricle; Vagus nerve;
   Vomiting
ID GASTRIC-MOTILITY; SYSTEM; MODEL
AB BACKGROUND: Gastroparesis following resection of a fourth ventricle tumor has never been reported in the literature. We report a unique case of gastroparesis following resection of a fourth-ventricle ependymoma in a child.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 14-year-old boy had a 12-day history of headache, nausea, and vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a tumor in the fourth ventricle. He underwent a posterior median craniotomy, and total removal was achieved. Histologic analysis revealed an anaplastic ependymoma (World Health Organization grade III). Three days after surgery, the patient complained of upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed dilatation of the stomach. Gastroscopy revealed moderate gastritis without gastric outlet obstruction. Nine days after surgery, a jejunal feeding tube (J-tube) was placed for nutritional support. Once the patient improved his oral intake and demonstrated that he could keep up with his nutritional requirements, the J-tube was discontinued 19 days after surgery. The patient had no neurologic or gastrointestinal complaints at the 2-month follow up.
   CONCLUSIONS: We report, to our knowledge, the first case of gastroparesis following resection of a fourth-ventricle ependymoma in a child. Gastroparesis can recover spontaneously, which we suspect may be due to reversible injury of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus.

DE Arachnoidal cyst; Atypical meningioma
AB BACKGROUND: Meningioma growing into an arachnoid cyst is an extremely rare event. Only 3 cases are reported in the literature. In 2 of them, an operative procedure in or near the arachnoid cyst preceded tumor growth.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of a patient requiring marsupialization of an arachnoid cyst of the middle cranial fossa. On follow-up, 3 years postoperatively he showed no signs of recurrence or tumor growth. One year later, the fourth year after surgery on the cyst, he presented with large tumor growth into the former cyst's cavity. Pathologic workup after resection revealed an atypical meningioma (World Health Organization grade II).
   CONCLUSIONS: We discuss the possible pathogenesis in light of the scarce published literature, as well as the differential diagnosis of this rapidly growing tumor.

DT Article
DE Dissecting aneurysm; Enterprise; Flow diverters; LVIS Blue; Vertebral
   artery dissection
ID DEVICE
AB A new Low-profile Visualized Intraluminal Support device (LVIS Blue) is a braided stent that provides a higher degree of metal coverage. This stent may be beneficial for complete obliteration of an aneurysm due to not only its support of a higher occlusion rate using coils inside of the aneurysm but also its flow-diverting effect. We introduce and describe a new flow-diversion technique using an LVIS Blue stent within an Enterprise stent for patients with vertebral artery (VA) dissecting aneurysms. A 6-Fr guiding catheter was positioned in the ipsilateral VA. A microcatheter with an inner diameter of 0.021 inches was navigated and positioned across the dissecting segment of the VA. An Enterprise stent was then deployed and used to cover the dissecting segment by pushing the pusher wire of the stent while simultaneously unsheathing the microcatheter. The microcatheter was navigated along the remaining pusher wire to the distal VA through the Enterprise stent. An LVIS Blue stent was introduced and positioned such that it overlapped the previous stent in order to divert blood flow away from the dissecting segment. We present a case in which this technique was used to successfully obliterate a dissecting aneurysm while maintaining the VA patency with vessel wall remodeling. The LVIS Blue stent-within-an-Enterprise stent technique may be an effective treatment option for patients with VA dissecting aneurysms as an alternative technique to flow diverters.

AB BACKGROUND: Anaplastic gangliogliomas at the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) are exceptionally rare with only a few reported cases in published literature. These are composed of atypical ganglion cells and astrocytes accounting for nearly 1% of all central nervous system tumors. The authors report the case of anaplastic ganglioglioma in an adult patient presenting as a CPA mass lesion. The presentation was bizarre, and the diagnosis was possible only after histopathologic examination of the resected mass.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 32-year-old lady presented with complaints of gradually progressive hearing loss and tinnitus in her right ear along with headache and ataxia. Neurologic evaluation revealed right-sided sensorineural hearing loss and truncal ataxia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was suggestive of a well-defined, contrast-enhancing, solid-cystic mass at the CPA cistern that extended into the porus acusticus, causing enlargement of the internal acoustic meatus. The features were suggestive of vestibular schwannoma of the CPA.
   CONCLUSIONS: This unusual appearance of anaplastic ganglioglioma has not been previously described. Neurosurgeons need to keep in mind the possibility of anaplastic gangliogliomas in the differential diagnosis of CPA lesions.

ID INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial hemorrhage stemming from a benign intracranial lesion is much less commonly seen than from malignant tumors such as gliomas or metastases. Cerebellopontine angle (CPA) lesions rarely present with hemorrhage.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe the case of a 49-year-old male with a recurrent right CPA meningioma arising from the petrous bone that was previously treated with a subtotal resection and postsurgical radiosurgery, presenting with acute left-sided hemiparesis secondary to intratumoral hemorrhage. Although surgical evacuation and decompression were recommended, the patient declined operative intervention and was managed medically.
   CONCLUSIONS: Meningiomas can cause subarachnoid, intraparenchymal, and rarely intratumoral hemorrhage. Symptomatic hemorrhage can worsen the prognosis, with increased morbidity and mortality. Several etiologies have been proposed for this phenomenon including rupture of aberrant vasculature, intratumoral necrosis, and tearing of stretched bridging veins. Only 2 prior cases of CPA meningioma have been reported in the literature. Recognition of CPA meningioma hemorrhage as a clinical entity can help in future diagnoses and management.

TI Spontaneous Regression of an Intraparenchymal Cyst Following Deep Brain
   Stimulator Electrode Implantation: Case Report and Literature Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Review
DE Complications; Deep brain stimulation; Edema; Intraparenchymal cyst
ID HARDWARE-RELATED COMPLICATIONS; RARE COMPLICATION; EDEMA
AB BACKGROUND: The development of an intraparenchymal cyst following deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery is an uncommon complication that lacks a clearly defined management strategy. The pathophysiology is not known and may be related to perielectrode edema or cerebrospinal fluid tracking. Previous case reports have described various therapies for symptomatic cysts, including hardware removal or conservative treatment with steroids.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a male patient with bilateral DBS of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus for management of essential tremor, who developed a cystic cavitation at the left electrode tip and was followed without treatment. This patient developed dysarthria, gait impairment, and unilateral motor deficits 3 months after surgery. Perielectrode edema was initially identified, eventually coalescing into a cystic cavitation at the electrode tip. Cystic regression and symptomatic improvement were observed without any surgical or medical intervention, with full cyst resolution by 17 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: Only 15 additional cases have been reported in the literature, although the true incidence may be underreported because of varying practices in obtaining postoperative scans. Cysts were identified in symptomatic patients on average 6.2 months after surgery. All symptomatic cysts were treated with hardware removal or steroid therapy. Observation alone may be sufficient when a DBS-associated cyst is identified. More reports are needed to characterize this rare complication.

DE Anatomy; Anomalies; Paracondylar; Paramastoid process; Variation
AB The paramastoid process is a rare variation found on the occipital bone as an extension of its jugular process. In the literature, this process has been called many names including the paraoccipital, paracondylar, or parajugular process. The paramastoid process can articulate with the lateral aspect of the transverse process of the atlas creating clinical consequences and potentially resulting in diminished range of motion of the head. Herein, we describe the anatomy, embryology, prevalence, imaging, and clinical consequences of the paramastoid process in order to improve our understanding of this rare anatomic variation.

   ANTICOAGULATION; DIAGNOSIS; OCCLUSION; UPDATE; RISK
AB BACKGROUND: Giant ruptured paraclinoid aneurysm with concomitant bilateral internal carotid artery dissection (CAD) can be a difficult condition to treat with current surgical and endovascular techniques. Paraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms remain a major challenge for vascular neurosurgeons. There are still controversies in the management of carotid artery (CA) dissections. Surgical and endovascular treatment is recommended in cases with multivessel dissections or those complicated by subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of a 35-year-old woman presenting clinical manifestations and tomographic findings compatible with SAH caused by rupture of a paraclinoid aneurysm in the left ICA. We had to treat the ruptured aneurysm and the concurrent dissection of both ICAs. The patient underwent high-flow extracranial-intracranial arterial graft bypass and subsequent trapping of the left ICA. Complete aneurysm exclusion from the cerebral circulation was achieved, and the possible embolic events from the left side were prevented. The concomitant right internal CAD was treated conservatively with anticoagulants and antiplatelets.
   CONCLUSIONS: Dealing only with the ruptured paraclinoid aneurysm, without taking care of the underlying cerebral ischemia owing to concomitant extracranial ICA dissection, could be an insufficient approach for treatment. In the presented case of a giant ruptured paraclinoid aneurysm and coexistence of severe bilateral ICA dissecting stenosis, trapping with matching the bypass flow was the proper solution for managing simultaneously with the aneurysm and the cerebral ischemia from the left side. Anticoagulants and antiplatelets were applied safely to treat the right internal CAD.

AB BACKGROUND: There is no consensus concerning the management of adult patients with posterior fossa metastasis-associated obstructive hydrocephalus, especially regarding surgical procedures. A literature review was performed to assess the surgical strategy in the management of patients with metastatic brain tumor.
   METHODS: A literature search was conducted of PubMed in November 2017 to identify all studies concerning brain metastases and obstructive hydrocephalus in English. All studies (except case reports and pediatric studies) between December 1953 and November 2017 that were about posterior fossa metastasise-associated obstructive hydrocephalus in adult patients were eligible. Eligible studies were classified by level of evidence. We assessed epidemiology, clinical and imaging findings, neurosurgical management, and prognosis of adult patients with posterior fossa metastasis-associated obstructive hydrocephalus. We suggest some practical considerations and a management decision tree on behalf of the Neuro-oncology Club of the French Society of Neurosurgery, with evidence-based analysis.
   RESULTS: Direct surgical resection could be considered for patients with asymptomatic obstructive hydrocephalus, and endoscopic third ventriculostomy seems to be a reasonable procedure for patients with symptomatic obstructive hydrocephalus. A ventriculoperitoneal or atrial shunt seems to be a valid alternative when patients have a history of central nervous system infection or ventricular hemorrhage, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, or unfavorable anatomy for an endoscopic third ventriculostomy to be performed.
   CONCLUSIONS: The Neuro-oncology Club of the French Society of Neurosurgery suggests a prospective assessment of these neurosurgical procedures to compare their safety and efficacy.

ID SHAPED SKIN INCISION; HARDWARE COMPLICATIONS; MOVEMENT-DISORDERS;
   RISK-FACTORS; EXPERIENCE; INFECTION; EROSION
AB BACKGROUND: Skin complications are a frequent type of complication of deep brain stimulation (DBS) neurosurgical procedure and are always observed in the postauricular area, scalp area, and implantable pulse generator pocket. Modifications to the surgical techniques for DBS have been proposed as therapeutic options. To prevent skin complications, we modified the surgical incisions.
   METHODS: At our center, we retrospectively analyzed the complications associated with traditional surgical incisions and then adjusted the double C-shaped incision and changed the postauricular incision from vertical to horizontal in patients undergoing DBS for movement disorders.
   RESULTS: Skin complications were observed in 4 patients among 30 patients who underwent traditional surgical incisions. In 102 consecutive patients who underwent operations with modified surgical incisions, we did not encounter any skin complications such as skin infection or erosion related to our modified incision. A single patient experienced pain and was cured after a week of local antiinflammatory treatment.
   CONCLUSION: By trying to avoid placing hardware directly under the suture line, our modified surgical incision successfully reduces the incidence of skin complications.

AB BACKGROUND: Persistent carotidebasilar connections have a prevalence of 0.14%. Recognizing such persistent fetal anastomoses between the carotid and the vertebrobasilar circulation is of great importance because they are reportedly associated with an increased prevalence of intracranial aneurysms.
   METHODS: We report the case of a 15-year-old female patient who presented with a World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade 5 subarachnoid hemorrhage from an aneurysm at the junction of a persistent primitive hypoglossal artery and the posterior inferior cerebellar artery origin. Supratentorially, unfortunately, there was no parenchymal blush or cortical venous return. Eventually, a multidisciplinary decision was made to withdraw care.
   RESULTS: Fifty-seven cases were reported in the literature to date of persistent hypoglossal arteries, 16 of which presented with an associated aneurysm, 5 with an arteriovenous malformation, and 6 with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Our case is the youngest patient reported so far. Hypoplasia or aplasia of the vertebral artery often were encountered (36 and 13 cases, respectively), as well as carotid artery stenosis (15 cases).
   CONCLUSIONS: Although uncommon, it is important to recognize persistent carotid-basilar connections, since they have a considerable hemodynamic impact on the posterior cerebral circulation via the carotid system. A critical reduction in the carotid blood flow will, therefore, have ischemic consequences in the posterior cerebral territories. In addition, such connections might be associated with anomalies of the vessel wall and be predisposed to aneurysm formation. The endovascular neurointerventionalist, as well as the vascular and skull base neurosurgeon, need to be aware of their anatomy and variations.

AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial pial arteriovenous fistulas (PAVFs) are rare cerebrovascular lesions with high mortality rates. We report a rare case of pediatric PAVF at the basilar artery tip and its treatment with surgical clipping aided by a trapping-evacuation technique in a hybrid operating room.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 18-month-old boy was admitted with hypoevolutism and 4-month history of weakness in the left extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a giant aneurysm-like malformation in the area of midbrain and pons. Angiography showed a high-flow PAVF fed by the basilar artery and bilateral P1 segments of the posterior cerebral artery, with deep draining veins into the transverse sinus and straight sinus. Given the intrinsic characteristics of the lesion, such as deep location, giant fistula and varix, and multiple feeding arteries, clipping of PAVF was performed in a hybrid operating room aided by a trapping-evacuation technique to clearly identify and block the shunting point.
   CONCLUSIONS: The successful obliteration of the lesion is reported. In addition, a brief review of literature comparing endovascular embolization, surgical disconnection, and hybrid technique for treatment of PAVF is included.

   EXPERIENCE; SECONDARY
AB BACKGROUND: Nearly 33,600 people die each year in the United States as a result of gunshot wounds (GSWs). Penetrating craniocerebral GSWs are often fatal with a nearly 70% death rate at the scene of the trauma. Overall combined mortality rate for patients who die at the scene or at the hospital is almost 91%. Poor outcome is associated with initial low Glasgow Coma Scale score and bihemispheric and transventricular gunshot trajectory. We summarize current understanding in management, prognostic factors, and survival outcomes in patients with a penetrating GSWs to the head. We report a patient with return to full function despite bihemispheric, multilobar involvement. Full function is defined here as ability to return to previous work and perform activities of daily living.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 33-year-old man sustained a GSW to the head under unknown circumstances. On initial presentation, he had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15. He was verbalizing and communicating but was amnestic for the event. From a left frontal entry wound, the bullet traversed both frontal lobes of the brain reaching the right frontal-parietal junction. Physical examination and vital signs were normal. Appropriate surgical and medical management resulted in complete recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Craniocerebral GSWs have a high mortality rate and usually require aggressive management. Evaluation of most GSWs requires appropriate imaging studies followed by proactive treatment against infection, seizure, and increased intracranial pressure. Surgical intervention is often necessary and ranges from local wound debridement to craniectomy, decompression, and wound exploration.

AB BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment of recurrent primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) has not yet been determined. We report a patient with recurrent PCNSL who has been successfully treated with stereotactic brachytherapy (SBT) with iodine-125 seeds plus temozolomide (TMZ).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 51-year-old man who underwent left occipital lobe tumor resection 11 years earlier presented with a 1-month history of right hand weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a recurrent PCNSL, which was confirmed by pathological examination. He was treated with SBT plus TMZ. At 1 month after surgery, a repeat MRI revealed nearly complete disappearance of the lesion. At 13.5 months postsurgery, the patient was neurologically intact except for right homonymous hemianopia, and follow-up MRI did not reveal a recurrent tumor.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case of recurrent PCNSL successfully treated with SBT plus TMZ. Further randomized studies are needed to confirm the therapeutic impact of this new method.

AB BACKGROUND: Lateral subluxation of the vertebra is commonly seen in degenerative lumbar scoliosis. Transforaminal endoscopic spine surgery is an emerging technique in spine surgery but has never been described as a treatment option for lumbar radiculopathy in the setting of lateral lumbar spondylolisthesis.
   METHODS: A technique for endoscopic treatment of lumbar disc herniation in the setting of lateral spondylolisthesis is presented. We retrospectively reviewed 199 cases of patients who underwent transforaminal endoscopic surgery in a 3-year period with a minimum follow-up of 1 year.
   RESULTS: Between 2014 and 2017, 4 patients (average age, 74.8 years; range, 69-82 years) underwent transforaminal endoscopic discectomy procedures for disc herniations at the level of lateral subluxation. One patient whose lateral subluxation was above an instrumented fusion required an extension of fusion to the operated level 5 months after endoscopic surgery for a reherniation. For the other 3 patients, mean visual analog scale score for radicular pain improved from an average pain score of 8.3 before surgery to 3.0 1 year after surgery, and Oswestry Disability Index improved from 26.7 to 4.7.
   CONCLUSIONS: Transforaminal endoscopic surgery for lumbar disc herniation in the setting of lateral subluxation of vertebral bodies is a unique minimally invasive approach for treatment of lumbar radiculopathy that might be considered as an alternative treatment to deformity correction surgery in older patients.

TI Orbital Infarction Syndrome Following Mechanical Thrombectomy Secondary
   to Embolization in New Territory
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Orbital infarction syndrome; Stroke; Thrombectomy
ID ARTERY-OCCLUSION; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Orbital infarction syndrome (OIS) is a rare entity defined as ischemia of all intraorbital and intraoccular structures including the optic nerve, extraocular muscles, and orbital fat. This entity is rare due to rich anastomotic orbital vascularization from both the internal carotid artery and external carotid artery. We report a case of a patient who suffered emboli to previously nonaffected territories to the ophthalmic artery and external carotid artery, which resulted in orbital infarction syndrome, and describe techniques to avoid such complications.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 66-year-old male presented to our institution with an acute ischemic stroke secondary to occlusion of the internal carotid artery terminus and M1 segment. The vessel was revascularized after 1 pass using a stent retriever. Postoperative angiography demonstrated sluggish flow in the distal right ophthalmic artery, as well as occlusion of the distal external carotid artery. Twenty-four hours following the procedure, the patient was noted to have complete ophthalmoplegia of the right eye, proptosis, and conjunctival chemosis. Computed tomography angiography demonstrated persistent occlusion of the distal right ophthalmic artery and external carotid artery. The right optic nerve was swollen, as were all extraocular muscles. A final diagnosis of orbital infarction syndrome was made given the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and occlusion of all vascular supply to the orbit on both conventional angiography and 24-hour computed tomography angiography.
   CONCLUSIONS: OIS is a rare entity that has not been previously described as a complication of mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke. OIS should be considered when patients present with blindness, orbital pain, and total ophthalmoplegia post thrombectomy.

ID OF-THE-LITERATURE; TRANSFORMATION; CHILDREN
AB BACKGROUND: Malignant craniopharyngioma or anaplastic craniopharyngioma was first reported in 1987 by Akachi and colleagues. It has malignant clinical and histological features, remarkably rapid progression, atypical pathology like squamous cell carcinoma, and a poor prognosis. To date, 17 cases of malignant craniopharyngioma have been reported, most of which were secondary malignant tumors. In classic benign craniopharyngioma, adjunctive treatment after gross total removal is not necessary, but in cases of malignant tumors, adjunctive treatment is important.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we report the first case of malignant craniopharyngioma treated with adjunctive gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery and chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide, as well as temozolomide chemotherapy). Treatment effectively controlled progression of the tumor temporarily.
   CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery and chemotherapy for malignant craniopharyngioma affects follow-up strategies, we propose the need for a revision to the World Health Organization classification regarding the evaluation of malignant craniopharyngioma.

   neuralgia
ID SURGICAL-TREATMENT; NERVE; COMPRESSION; SYNCOPE
AB BACKGROUND: Glossopharyngeal neuralgia (GPN) is a rare condition, commonly misdiagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia. Microvascular decompression (MVD) is considered the first line of treatment in medically refractive idiopathic GPN, and the recurrence rate is reported to be 7.1%. We present our first case report on the surgical management of a patient with recurrent GPN and analyze the possible causes for recurrence after MVD.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 73-year-old gentleman was referred to us with a diagnosis of recurrent left GPN. He was diagnosed 6 years ago with left mandibular branch trigeminal neuralgia for the complaint of left-side tongue pain. He received left mandibular nerve block twice earlier and Gamma Knife radiotherapy 2 years ago without relief. A year ago he was diagnosed with GPN by a neurosurgeon, and MVD was performed. The posterior inferior cerebellar artery and vertebral artery were the offending vessels and were interposed with Teflon. After a temporary pain relief, the patient had a recurrence. Redo-MVD with transposition of the vertebral artery and further interposition of posterior inferior cerebellar artery did not help. After referral to us, we operated on the patient again and found 2 small arteries at the root entry zone (REZ). Interposition with Teflon and splitting of the rootlets relieved the pain.
   CONCLUSIONS: MVD is considered the first line of treatment in drugresistant idiopathic GPN. Thorough exploration of REZ for small arteries and veins is mandatory to prevent recurrence. Vascular compression can occur at the cisternal portion or at the REZ. In recurrent cases, splitting of the glossopharyngeal nerve rootlets adds to the good outcome.

AB BACKGROUND: Lhermitte-Duclos disease is an extremely rare pathologic entity characterized by a cerebellar mass composed of enlarged cerebellar folia containing abnormal ganglion cells. This entity usually presents in young and middle-aged adults and rarely in children. There is no study in the literature analyzing the long-term clinical course of this disease to assess the behavior primarily because of its rarity.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present our experience with a 7-year-old patient of Lhermitte-Duclos disease who was followed up for 5 years and found to have progressed to bilateral World Health Organization grade IV medulloblastoma. This case denotes the malignant potential of this rare disorder.
   CONCLUSIONS: LDD is seen rarely and demands a high degree of suspicion in patients presenting with cerebellar mass and/or imaging characteristics. It is prudent to keep these patients in close follow-up for early detection of malignant transformation.

   COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; EARLY-DIAGNOSIS; MANAGEMENT; ANTICOAGULATION;
   HOSPITALIZATION; GUIDELINES; ADMISSION
AB BACKGROUND: Prior studies have shown that most patients with mild traumatic brain injury or negative computed tomography (CT) scans of the head rarely decline or require neurosurgical interventions. One common reason for a delayed decline is an intracranial hemorrhage that presents within 24-48 hours. This is typically seen in elderly patients and/or patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulation agents. We describe a case of a delayed subdural hemorrhage presenting in a young adult not on any antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 19-year-old male presented to the emergency department after being involved in a motor vehicle accident. He had a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15, and an initial CT was negative for any intracranial hemorrhage or pathology, so he was then admitted to the intensive care unit for further care. The patient received 1 dose of aspirin 325 mg the following day for treatment of blunt cerebrovascular injury. Six hours later he reported a severe headache and had an episode of emesis with a subsequent rapid neurologic decline. Repeat CT showed an acute right subdural hematoma, and he underwent an emergent right decompressive hemicraniectomy.
   CONCLUSIONS: In rare cases, patients with negative initial head CT scans neurologically deteriorate as a result of a delayed acute subdural hematoma. We present an unusual case of a young patient on no medications with no CT findings of an intracranial injury who neurologically declined due to a delayed acute subdural hematoma.

DE Fourth ventricle; Intra-axial schwannoma; Intraventricular; Schwannoma
ID INTRAVENTRICULAR SCHWANNOMA; VENTRICLE
AB BACKGROUND: Schwannomas have been reported in several unusual intracranial locations. Here we report 2 cases of extremely rare schwannomas originating in the fourth ventricle, without attachment to the surrounding structures. The clinical course, radiologic and pathological features, treatment, and follow-up are described.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Case 1 was a 49-year-old man who presented with symptoms of paroxysmal dizziness and vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a mixed solid-cystic mass occupying the inferior half of the fourth ventricle. Complete excision of the tumor was performed via midline suboccipital craniectomy. The histological diagnosis was intraventricular schwannoma. Case 2 was an 18-year-old man with chronic vertigo and progressive gait unsteadiness. MRI revealed a heterogeneously enhancing lesion completely filling the fourth ventricle. An Ommaya tube was placed in the ventricle to relieve symptoms of hydrocephalus, followed by tumor resection performed via a suboccipital craniotomy. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of schwannoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Fourth ventricular schwannomas are rare but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of contrast-enhancing intraventricular tumors in both children and adults. Although their etiopathological origin may differ from that of extra-axial schwannomas, their imaging, histology, and clinical course appear to be identical, and these tumors should be managed similarly.

TI MRI Tractography Detecting Cranial Nerve Displacement in a Cystic Skull

AB A 37-year-old man came to our neurosurgical department with a 2-month history of a progressive invalidating balance disorder. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging found a T2-weighted hypersignal lesion of the right cerebellopontine angle that severely compressed the brainstem, however the position of cranial nerves was not clearly identified. The new MRI diffusion tool, tractography, allowed to reconstruct the trajectory of cranial nerves that were displaced by the tumor. As such, the acoustic facial bundle was severely flattened posteriorly and superiorly, while the lower nerves were pushed inferiorly. Effective neurosurgical decompression was performed and confirmed the position of cranial nerves VLXII. The patient was discharged and returned home without any cranial nerve deficit. This case illustrates how advances in imaging can now better describe the anatomy surrounding brain tumors and make surgery safer to the benefit of patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Vagal nerve stimulators (VNs) have been in use in the United States since the 1990s as a palliative treatment option for drug-resistant epilepsy. Over time, the electrode coils wrapped around the vagus nerve become encapsulated by extensive scar tissue, making complete electrode removal challenging. We present a case series of lead revision surgeries with a unique way to remove the scar tissue around the vagus nerve, demonstrating a technique for complete electrode removal.
   METHODS: This was a case series of 9 consecutive patients who underwent complete removal of an existing VNs electrode using needle tip monopolar electrocautery.
   RESULTS: Complete removal of the entire VNs electrode array was achieved in all patients with no permanent complications seen at postoperative follow-up at 3 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: Complete VNs electrode array removal can be safely achieved by using needle tip monopolar electrocautery.

AB INTRODUCTION: Primary solitary intracranial malignant melanoma (PIMM) is extremely rare. In 1992, an extensive review of 81 patients with PIMM was undertaken. Imaging studies, microsurgery, and adjuvant therapy have developed considerably over the last 25 years, and targeted therapy recently has been proven successful for metastatic melanoma. These factors could influence current and future clinical PIMM results.
   METHODS: We undertook a literature search of PIMM patients since 1992.
   RESULTS: We reviewed 49 cases of PIMM. The mean age was 45.8 years. No significant sex difference was found. Intracranial hypertension and focal neurologic deficits were commonly observed around 70% and 40%, respectively. There were no significant differences of survival period according to tumor sites. Surgeries were performed in 42 of 49 patients with PIMM reviewed (92%). The mean survival of the gross total removal group was significantly longer than that of surgical results (> 22 months vs. 12 months (interquartile range: 5-22 months; P = 0.026). For adjuvant therapy, 9 patients underwent chemotherapy and 18 patients underwent radiotherapy postoperatively There was no significant difference in survival period between with and without adjuvant therapies. Leptomeningeal enhancement diagnosed in the initial MRI, was the worst prognostic factor.
   CONCLUSIONS: Gross total removal of the PIMM was the most promising treatment. Currently adjuvant therapy has not been associated with the survival period. To improve clinical outcome, immunotherapy and targeted therapies are likely to become more important.

   ANGIOGRAPHY
AB BACKGROUND: Traumatic pseudoaneurysm of the middle meningeal artery (PMMA) is rare. Its rupture is associated with high mortality, so an early diagnosis is recommended for this risky condition. In the absence of a specific guideline, computed tomography (CT), digital subtraction angiography, and CT angiography (CTA) are proposed for its diagnosis. CTA is the technique of choice even if it is almost never performed, especially in mild head injury. We report a rare case of a delayed rupture of PMMA, analyzed from a forensic point of view.
   METHODS: Fifteen days after mild blunt head trauma, characterized by temporal fracture and a small hemorrhage near the rim, a wide intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) occurred. The onset of IPH was marked by neurologic deterioration and arm paralysis. Immediate head CT showed IPH, and CTA showed PMMA. Prompt surgery could not help patient survival. The goal of autopsy was to formulate the cause of death and to individuate potential medical negligence.
   RESULTS: In the literature, 16 cases of 54 are related to PMMA (26%) and are associated with IPH. IPH can be acute or delayed. Eight cases of acute IPH and 8 cases of delayed IPH (including our case), both coexisting with PMMA, are described. The literature review showed that the association of temporal rim fracture and a small hemorrhage nearby is highly predictive of PMMA formation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, in the presence of these 2 risk factors after heat trauma, CTA is strongly suggested.

   tuberculosis; Tuberculoma
ID MECKELS CAVE
AB BACKGROUND: Central nervous system tuberculoma is the most severe manifestation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis with high mortality. Cavernous sinus tuberculoma (CST) is a very rare central nervous system tuberculoma with few cases reported in the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 57-year-old woman was admitted to our clinic with acute diplopia and headache limited to the right side. There was no specific medical history except for migraine, depression, and anxiety, all of which were controlled by oral medications. Physical examination revealed ptosis and mydriasis in the right eye, which indicated right third and sixth cranial nerve palsies. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed a right parasellar lesion at the cavernous sinus wall and ophthalmic nerve. Laboratory examinations and brain computed tomography scan showed negative findings. Initial differential diagnosis included meningioma, sarcoidosis, tuberculoma, and lymphoma. However, results of further studies, including blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures and Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA assay, were negative. Biopsy of the cerebral lesion was performed through the subfrontal approach, and histopathologic study confirmed CST. She was treated with a standard antituberculous regimen. After 12 months of follow-up, no cerebral or clinical findings were seen.
   CONCLUSIONS: CST is a rare presentation of M. tuberculosis, and the diagnosis is a difficult challenge. However, accurate diagnosis and timely treatment of CST can result in complete cure.

AB BACKGROUND: Neurosurgeons who operate in and around the pathway of the ocular nerves should have good knowledge of not only their normal anatomy but also their variations.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: During routine dissection of the orbits in an adult cadaver, an aberrant branch of the right trochlear nerve continued on to innervate the orbicularis oculi muscle. In this case, the trochlear nerve also provided a branch to the supratrochlear nerve.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons who operate along the pathway of the trochlear nerve such as the cavernous sinus should be aware of such an anatomic variant in order to avoid unwanted complications such as weakness of the orbicularis oculi muscle.

AB Good knowledge of the anatomy of veins is of crucial importance for the functional surgery of cranial nerve (CN) disorders, especially microvascular decompression for trigeminal neuralgia (TN), hemifacial spasm (HFS), and vagoglossopharyngeal neuralgia (VGPN). Although controversial, veins may be involved in neurovascular conflicts and may constitute dangerous obstacles to access to the CNs.
   With the aim of estimating the implications of veins in those diseases and evaluating the linked surgical difficulties, we carried out a review of the literature from 2000 to the end of February 2018. For this review, articles found on PubMed that gave enough precision about veins were retained (39 articles on TN, 38 on HFS, 8 on VGPN, and 26 on complications related to venous sacrifices). Before this review, we described a simplified anatomic classification of veins, amenable to easing the surgical approach to CNs. Access to the trigeminal nerve, via the infratentorial-supracerebellar route, is almost always affected by the superficial superior petrosal venous system, whereas access to the facial and cochleovestibular complex as well as to the lower CNs, through the infrafloccular trajectory, is almost always exempt of important venous obstacles.
   Respective incidences of venous compression at the origin of hyperactive CN syndromes are given. The percentages of a venous conflict alone were calculated at 10.8% for TN, 0.1% for HFS, and 2.9% for VGPN. We review the complications considered in relation with venous sacrifices. Precautions to minimize these complications are given.

ID CORPUS CALLOSOTOMY; DETACHABLE COILS; EMBOLIZATION; SURGERY; RATES
AB BACKGROUND: Excision of coil mass during clipping of recurrent or residual aneurysms after prior endovascular coiling is challenging. We evaluated the use of the carbon dioxide laser for safe and effective removal of coils during aneurysm surgery. Two cases are presented.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The first patient was a 56-year-old man with a previously coiled ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Angiography at 3-year follow-up showed recurrent aneurysm, which could not be coiled again owing to technical reasons. An aneurysm clip could not be safely applied owing to the weight of the coil mass compromising the parent vessel lumen. Laserassisted coil mass resection was performed before permanent clip application. Intraoperative cerebral angiography showed complete obliteration of the aneurysm. The second patient was a 69-year-old woman with a previously coiled unruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysm. Angiography at 2-year follow-up showed recurrence of the aneurysm, which could not be coiled again owing to technical reasons. Laser-assisted coil mass resection was performed before the aneurysm was safely clipped. Intraoperative angiography showed complete obliteration of the aneurysm. No complications occurred using the carbon dioxide laser. At 1-year follow-up, both patients were asymptomatic with no evidence of aneurysmal recurrence.
   CONCLUSIONS: Excision of coil mass is required while treating recurrent and/or residual intracranial aneurysms that were previously treated by endovascular technique. The use of carbon dioxide laser assistance while retrieving these coils is safe and effective.

AB BACKGROUND: The relationship between temporal lobe epilepsy and focal limb dystonia is a well-recognized phenomenon, yet its pathogenesis and anatomic foundation are not well understood. Here, we describe 2 patients with refractory focal epilepsy and contralateral focal limb dystonia whose seizures and dystonic symptoms simultaneously resolved after anterior temporal lobectomy and amygdalohippocampectomy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We identified 2 patients within the Mount Sinai Health system with improvement in dystonia after medial temporal lobectomy. Retrospective chart reviews for the clinical history were performed. Patient 1 suffered a traumatic injury of the right temporal lobe, developing left hemidystonia and epilepsy. He received a right amygdala-hippocampectomy, which resolved both. Patient 2 has a history of right temporal glioma resection complicated by an infarct, resulting in left hemidystonia and epilepsy. He received a right medial temporal resection, which nearly resolved both.
   CONCLUSION: Our cases demonstrate a medial temporal-basal ganglia network dysfunction in dystonia-epilepsy that was modulated and cured by resective surgery. We hypothesize that the mechanisms behind these observed phenomena were due to a pathologic connectivity of the basal ganglia and amygdala-hippocampus. To our knowledge, these are the first reported cases of dystonia and concomitant epilepsy resolving with temporal lobectomy and provide valuable prognostic information for similarly affected patients.
