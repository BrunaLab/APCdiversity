AB A migration electric-field assisted electrocoagulation (MEAEC) system was developed to increase phosphate removal from domestic wastewater, with reduced energy consumption, using a titanium charging (inert) electrode and a sacrificial iron anode. In the MEAEC, an electric field was applied between the inert electrode (titanium) and an air cathode to drive migration of phosphate anions towards the sacrificial anode. Current was then applied between the sacrificial anode (Fe or Al mesh) and the air cathode to drive electrocoagulation of phosphate. A MEAEC with the Fe electrode using primary clarifier effluent achieved 98% phosphate removal, producing water with a total phosphorus of 0.3 mg/L with <6 min total treatment time (five cycles; each 10 s inert electrode charging, and 1 min electrocoagulation), at a constant current density of 1 mA/cm(2). In the absence of the 10 s charging time, electrocoagulation required 15 min for the same removal. With an aluminum anode and the same phosphorus removal, the MEAEC required 7 cycles (7 min total treatment, 1 min 10 s total charging), while conventional electrocoagulation required 20 min. The energy demand of Fe-MEAEC was only 0.039 kWh/m(3) for 98% phosphate removal, which was 35% less than with the Al-MEAEC of 0.06 kWh/m(3), and 28% less than that previously obtained using an inert graphite electrode. Analysis of the precipitate showed that a less porous precipitate was obtained with the Al anode than with the Fe anode. The phosphorus in precipitate of Fe-MEAEC was identified as PO43- and HPO42-, while the Fe was present as both Fe2+ and Fe3+. Only HPO42- and Al3+ were identified in the precipitate of the Al-MEAEC. These results indicated that the MEAEC with a titanium inert charging electrode and iron anode could achieve the most efficient phosphate removal with very low energy demands, compared to previous electrochemical approaches.

AB Micropollutants are a diverse group of compounds that are detected at trace concentrations and may have a negative effect on the environment and/or human health. Most of them are unregulated contaminants, although they have raised a concern in the scientific and global community and future regulation might be written in the near future. Several approaches have been tested to remove micro pollutants from wastewater streams. In this manuscript, a focus is placed in reactor biological treatments that use white-rot fungi. A critical review of white-rot fungal-based technologies for micropollutant removal from wastewater has been conducted, several capabilities and limitations of such approaches have been identified and a range of solutions to overcome most of the limitations have been reviewed and/or proposed. Overall, this review argues that white-rot fungal reactors could be an efficient technology to remove micropollutants from specific wastewater streams. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Superfine powdered activated carbon (SPAC; particle diameter similar to 1 mu m) has greater adsorptivity for organic molecules than conventionally sized powdered activated carbon (PAC). Although SPAC is currently used in the pretreatment to membrane filtration at drinking water purification plants, it is not used in conventional water treatment consisting of coagulation-flocculation, sedimentation, and rapid sand filtration (CSF), because it is unclear whether CSF can adequately remove SPAC from the water. In this study, we therefore investigated the residual SPAC particles in water after CSF treatment. First, we developed a method to detect and quantify trace concentration of carbon particles in the sand filtrate. This method consisted of 1) sampling particles with a membrane filter and then 2) using image analysis software to manipulate a photomicrograph of the filter so that black spots with a diameter >0.2 mu m (considered to be carbon particles) could be visualized. Use of this method revealed that CSF removed a very high percentage of SPAC: approximately 5-log in terms of particle number concentrations and approximately 6-log in terms of particle volume concentrations. When waters containing 7.5-mg/L SPAC and 30-mg/L PAC, concentrations that achieved the same adsorption performance, were treated, the removal rate of SPAC was somewhat superior to that of PAC, and the residual particle number concentrations for SPAC and PAC were at the same low level (100-200 partides/mL). Together, these results suggest that SPAC can be used in place of PAC in CSF treatment without compromising the quality of the filtered water in terms of particulate matter contamination. However, it should be noted that the activated carbon particles after sand filtration were smaller in terms of particle size and were chargeneutralized to a lesser extent than the activated carbon particles before sand filtration. Therefore, the tendency of small particles to escape in the filtrate would appear to be related to the fact that their small size leads to a low destabilization rate during the coagulation process and a low collision rate during the flocculation and filtration processes.

TI Highly effective enhancement of waste activated sludge dewaterability by

AB Proteins are the dominant organic component of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in waste activated sludge (WAS), and play an important role during sludge dewatering processes. Methanol is a polar hydrophilic reagent and can denature proteins, which suggested to us that the modification of protein configurations with methanol could improve sludge dewatering performance.
   In this study, methanol was used to precondition WAS prior to adding inorganic coagulants for dewatering enhancement. The morphology and EPS properties (especially of proteins) were investigated to analyze and explain the effects of methanol in the sludge conditioning process. The results show that methanol performed much better than traditional inorganic coagulants in improving sludge dewaterability in term of specific resistance to filtration (SRF) and cake solid content (CSC). Extractable proteins in EPS increased to a maximum when the concentration of methanol reached 40% (w/w) because cell membranes were destroyed and intracellular substances and water were released. Floc protein content was reduced with the further increase in methanol concentration due to protein precipitation. Confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis indicated that proteins precipitated and formed larger aggregates because methanol destroyed both the hydration shell and the hydrophobic clusters of proteins and expanded the protein tertiary structure to release interstitial water and bound water. The combination treatment of methanol and inorganic coagulants (PAC or FeCl3) showed significant synergetic effects on enhancing sludge dewatering and cake drying. In practical applications, methanol from the dewatering sludge can be returned to the biochemical pool and used as the carbon source for nitrogen removal in the denitrification process. This integrated process is appropriate for sludge final disposal technologies that have high energy demands, such as incineration and pyrolysis. This paper describes a novel approach to improving sludge dewaterability through the alteration of protein properties by use of physiochemical techniques. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Assessment of ecological status for the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) is based on "Biological Quality Elements" (BQEs), namely phytoplankton, benthic flora, benthic invertebrates and fish. Morphological identification of these organisms is a time-consuming and expensive procedure. Here, we assess the options for complementing and, perhaps, replacing morphological identification with procedures using eDNA, metabarcoding or similar approaches. We rate the applicability of DNA-based identification for the individual BQEs and water categories (rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters) against eleven criteria, summarised under the headlines representativeness (for example suitability of current sampling methods for DNA-based identification, errors from DNA-based species detection), sensitivity (for example capability to detect sensitive taxa, unassigned reads), precision of DNA-based identification (knowledge about uncertainty), comparability with conventional approaches (for example sensitivity of metrics to differences in DNA-based identification), cost effectiveness and environmental impact. Overall, suitability of DNA-based identification is particularly high for fish, as eDNA is a well-suited sampling approach which can replace expensive and potentially harmful methods such as gill-netting, trawling or electrofishing. Furthermore, there are attempts to replace absolute by relative abundance in metric calculations. For invertebrates and phytobenthos, the main challenges include the modification of indices and completing barcode libraries. For phytoplankton, the barcode libraries are even more problematic, due to the high taxonomic diversity in plankton samples. If current assessment concepts are kept, DNA-based identification is least appropriate for macrophytes (rivers, lakes) and angiosperms/macroalgae (transitional and coastal waters), which are surveyed rather than sampled. We discuss general implications of implementing DNA-based identification into standard ecological assessment, in particular considering any adaptations to the WFD that may be required to facilitate the transition to molecular data.

AB It is now widely accepted that coating on the nano-surface would critically dictate the uptake and cytotoxicity of engineering nanomaterials. However, the influence of natural organic matter (NOM) on the surface is quite limited to humic substances, while the diversity of NOM is neglected. In the present study, we tried to investigate the change of surface in the coexistence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and humic acid (HA). The isothermal titration calorimetric measurements show that HA can combine with BSA in both freshwater or seawater, however, the patterns are different. In freshwater, HA lowered the adsorption of BSA on PVP-capped AgNPs through complexation with BSA, which prevented the contact of sulfur in BSA with PVP-AgNPs. Then in seawater, BSA retained its sulfur availability to bind with PVP-AgNPs. Furthermore, the toxicity of PVP-AgNPs incubated in the BSA/HA solution was evaluated by measuring the level of reactive oxygen species generated by Escherichia coli. The results indicated that, in seawater, the adsorbed BSA promoted the toxicity of PVP-AgNPs in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+, but the presence of HA limited this effect. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Increasingly, technologies that use sulfide as an electron donor are being considered for nitrogen removal; however, our understanding of how sulfide affects microbial communities in nitrifying treatment processes is limited. In this study, we used batch experiments to quantify sulfide inhibition of both ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) using activated sludge from two full-scale treatment plants with distinct treatment processes. The batch experiments showed that NOB were more vulnerable to sulfide inhibition than AOB, and that inhibition constants (K-l) for NOB were distinct between the two treatment plants, which also had distinct nitrite oxidizing microbial communities. A Nitrospira-rich, less diverse NOB community was inhibited more by sulfide than a more diverse community rich in Nitrotoga and Nitrobacter. Therefore, sulfide-induced nitritation may be more successful in less diverse, Nitrospira-rich communities. Additionally, sulfide significantly influenced the activity of non-nitrifying microbial community members, as measured by 16S rRNA cDNA sequencing. Overall, these results indicate that sulfide has a strong impact on both nitrification and the activity of the underlying microbial communities, and that the response is community-specific.

AB The feasibility of using spent coffee ground (SCG) as a new bulking agent for biodrying of dewatered sludge (DS) was investigated in comparison with two other frequently-used bulking agents, air-dried sludge (AS) and sawdust (SD). Results showed that the moisture contents (MC) of 16-day DS biodrying with AS (Trial A), SCG (Trial B) and SD (Trial C) decreased from 70.14 wt%, 68.25 wt% and 71.63 wt% to 59.12 wt%, 41.35 wt% and 57.69 wt%, respectively. In case of Trial B, the MC rapidly decreased to 46.16 wt% with the highest water removal (70.87%) within 8 days because of the longest high-temperature period (5.8 days). Further studies indicated that the abundant biodegradable volatile solids (BVS) and high dissolved organic matter (DOM) contents in SCG were the main driving forces for water removal. According to pyrosequencing data, Firmicutes, most of which were recognized as thermophiles, was rapidly enriched on Day 8 and became the dominant phylum in Trial B. Four thermophilic genera, Bacillus, Ureibacillus, Geobacillus and Thermobifida, which can produce thermostable hydrolytic extracellular enzymes, were the most abundant in Trial B, indicating that these thermophilic bacteria evolved during the long high-temperature period enhanced the biodegradation of BVS in SCG. The 8-day biodried product of Trial B was demonstrated to be an excellent solid fuel with low heating value (LHV) of 9284 kj kg(-1), which was 2.1 and 1.8 times those of biodried products with AS and SD, respectively. Thus SCG was found to be an excellent bulking agent accelerating DS biodrying and producing a solid fuel with a high calorific value. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Photodegradation is the main depletion pathway for methylmercury (MeHg) in surface water. The formation of MeHg-dissolved organic matter (DOM) complexes has been found to be a key step in MeHg photodegradation. However, the major functional groups involved in the DOM-mediated process have yet to be clearly resolved. In this work, we systematically investigated the effects of DOM molecular structures on MeHg photodegradation by using a variety of organic ligands with different functional groups (e.g., thiosalicylate, thiophenol, and thioaniline). The results showed that thiol and phenyl groups may be the major functional groups governing DOM-mediated MeHg photodegradation, with photodegradation rates also dependent on the type (carboxyl, hydroxyl, and amino group) and position (ortho-, meta-, and para-) of other chemical substituents. The addition of "non-photochemically active" thiol ligands (e.g., mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol) and high concentrations of Cl- can significantly inhibit the o-thiosalicylate-induced MeHg photodegradation, indicating that complexation of MeHg with these ligands is necessary for MeHg photodegradation. Sparging with O-2 had a negligible effect on MeHg photodegradation, while sparging with N-2 significantly enhanced MeHg photodegradation. This finding suggests that MeHg photodegradation may be a reductive process, which was further supported by identification of the degradation products of MeHg. A possible protonolysis mechanism of MeHg photodegradation in the presence of o-thiosalicylate was then proposed based on the findings of this study. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As reclaimed water use is increasing, its safety attracts growing attention, particularly with respect to the health risks associated with the wide range of micropollutants found in the reclaimed water. In this study, sophisticated analysis was conducted for water samples from a water reclamation and ecological reuse system where domestic wastewater was treated using an anaerobic-anoxic-oxic unit followed by a membrane bioreactor (A(2)O-MBR), and the reclaimed water was used for replenishing a landscape lake. A total of 58 organic micropollutants were detected in the system, consisting of 13 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 16 phenols, 3 pesticides, and 26 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). After treatment by the A(2)O-MBR process, effective removal of pesticides and phenols was achieved, while when the reclaimed water entered the landscape lake, PPCPs were further removed. From the physicochemical properties of micropollutants, it could be inferred that phenols and dichlorphos (the only pesticide with considerable concentration in the influent) would have been mainly removed by biodegradation and/or volatilization in the biological treatment process. Additionally, it is probable that sludge adsorption also contributed to the removal of dichlorphos. For the predominant PPCP removal in the landscape lake, various actions, such as adsorption, biodegradation, photolysis, and ecologically mediated processes (via aquatic plants and animals), would have played significant roles. However, according to their logK(oc), logK(ow) and logD (pH = 8) values, it could be concluded that adsorption by suspended solids might be an important action. Although carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks associated with all the detected micropollutants were at negligible levels, the hazard quotients (HQs) of PPCPs accounted for 92.03%-97.23% of the HQ(Total). With the significant removal of PPCPs through the ecological processes in the landscape lake, the safety of reclaimed water use could be improved. Therefore, the introduction of ecological unit into the water reclamation and reuse system could be an effective measure for health risk reduction posed by micropollutants. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper evaluates the oxidation of an antibacterial agent, chlorophene (4-chloro-2-(phenylmethyl) phenol, CP), by permanganate (Mn(VII)) in water. Second-order rate constant (k) for the reaction between Mn(VII) and CP was measured as (2.05 +/- 0.05) x 10(1) M-1 s(-1) at pH 7.0 for an initial CP concentration of 20.0 mu M and Mn(VII) concentration of 60.0 mu M. The value of k decreased with increasing pH in the pH range of 5.0-7.0, and then increased with an increase in solution pH from 7.0 to 10.0. The presence of MnO2 and Fe3+ in water generally enhanced the removal of CP, while the effect of humic acid was not obvious. Fourteen oxidation products of CP were identified by an electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometer, and direct oxidation, ring-opening, and decarboxylation were mainly observed in the reaction process. The initial reaction sites of CP by Mn(VII) oxidation were rationalized by density functional theory calculations. Toxicity changes of the reaction solutions were assessed by the luminescent bacteria P. phosphoreum, and the intermediate products posed a relatively low ecological risk during the degradation process. The efficient removal of CP in secondary clarifier effluent and river water demonstrated the potential application of this Mn(VII) oxidation method in water treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sediment microbes have a great potential to transform reactive N to harmless N-2, thus decreasing wastewater nitrogen load into aquatic ecosystems. Here, we examined if spatial allocation of the wastewater discharge by a specially constructed sediment diffuser pipe system enhanced the microbial nitrate reduction processes. Full-scale experiments were set on two Finnish lake sites, Keuruu and Petajavesi, and effects on the nitrate removal processes were studied using the stable isotope pairing technique. All nitrate reduction rates followed nitrate concentrations, being highest at the wastewater-influenced sampling points. Complete denitrification with N-2 as an end-product was the main nitrate reduction process, indicating that the high nitrate and organic matter concentrations of wastewater did not promote nitrous oxide (N2O) production (truncated denitrification) or ammonification (dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium; DNRA). Using 3D simulation, we demonstrated that the sediment diffusion method enhanced the contact time and amount of wastewater near the sediment surface especially in spring and in autumn, altering organic matter concentration and oxygen levels, and increasing the denitrification capacity of the sediment. We estimated that natural denitrification potentially removed 3-10% of discharged wastewater nitrate in the 33 ha study area of Keuruu, and the sediment diffusion method increased this areal denitrification capacity on average 45%. Overall, our results indicate that sediment diffusion method can supplement wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) nitrate removal without enhancing alternative harmful processes. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB In this study, batch experiments were carried out to investigate the key factors on sulfamethoxazole (SMX) removal kinetics in a new AOPs based on the combination of zero valent iron (Fe-0) and bisulfite (S(IV)). With the increase of Fe-0 from 0.25 mM to 5 mM, the removal rate of SMX was linearly increased in the Fe-0/S(IV)/O-2 system by accelerating the activation of S(IV) and Fe-0 corrosion to accelerate. In the first 10 min of reaction, the increasing concentration of S(IV) inhibited SMX removal after since the high S(IV) concentration quenched reactive oxidative species (ROS). Then SMX removal rate was accelerated with the increase of S(IV) concentration after S(IV) were consumed up The optimal ratio of S(IV) concentrations to Fe-0 concentration for SMX removal in the Fe-0/S(IV)/O-2 system was 1:1. With SMX concentrations increasing from 1 to 50 mu M, SMX removal rate was inhibited for the limitation of ROS yields. Although the presence of center dot SO4- and center dot OH was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum, center dot OH was identified as the dominant ROS in the Fe-0/S(IV)/O-2 system by chemical quenching experiments. Besides, strong inhibitive effects of 1,10-phenanthroline on SMX degradation kinetics by Fe-0/S(IV)/O-2 proved that the generation of ROS was rely on the release of Fe(II) and Fe(III) The generation of center dot SO4- was ascribed to the activation of S(IV) by Fe(II)/Fe(III) recycling and the activation of HSO5- by Fe(II) And center dot OH was simultaneously transformed from center dot SO4- and generated by Fe-0/O-2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was conducted to reveal special reactive sites on SMX for radicals attacking and predicted intermediates. Finally, four possible SMX degradation pathways were accordingly proposed in the Fe-0/S(IV)/O-2 system based on experimental methods and DFT calculation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The subdivision of biofilm reactor in two or more stages (i.e., reactor staging) represents an option for process optimisation of biological treatment. In our previous work, we showed that the gradient of influent organic substrate availability (induced by the staging) can influence the microbial activity (i.e., denitrification and pharmaceutical biotransformation kinetics) of a denitrifying three-stage Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) system. However, it is unclear whether staging and thus the long-term exposure to varying organic carbon type and loading influences the microbial community structure and diversity. In this study, we investigated biofilm structure and diversity in the three-stage MBBR system (S) compared to a single-stage configuration (U) and their relationship with microbial functions. Results from 16S rRNA amplicon libraries revealed a significantly higher microbial richness in the staged MBBR (at 99% sequence similarity) compared to single-stage MBBR. A more even and diverse microbial community was selected in the last stage of S (S3), likely due to exposure to carbon limitation during continuous-flow operation. A core of OTUs was shared in both systems, consisting of Burkholderiales, Xanthomonadales, Flavobacteriales and Sphingobacteriales, while MBBR staging selected for specific taxa (i.e., Candidate division WS6 and Deinococcales). Results from quantitative PCR (qPCR) showed that S3 exhibited the lowest abundance of 16S rRNA but the highest abundance of atypical nosZ, suggesting a selection of microbes with more diverse N-metabolism (i.e., incomplete denitrifiers) in the stage exposed to the lowest carbon availability. A positive correlation (p<0.05) was observed between removal rate constants of several pharmaceuticals with abundance of relevant denitrifying genes, but not with biodiversity. Despite the previously suggested positive relationship between microbial diversity and functionality in macrobial and microbial ecosystems, this was not observed in the current study, indicating a need to further investigate structure-function relationships for denitrifying systems.

AB OBJECTIVE: Susceptibility artifacts from metal clips in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging present an obstacle to evaluating the status of clipped aneurysms, parent arteries, and adjacent brain parenchyma. We aimed to develop MR-compatible aneurysm clips.
   METHODS: Considering the mechanical and biologic properties, as well as MR compatibility of candidate materials, a prototype clip with a zirconia body and a polyurethane head spring (zirconia clip [ZC], straight, 9-mm long) was developed. The closing forces, opening width of blades, and in vitro and in vivo artifact volumes in 3 tesla MR imaging were compared among the prototype and commercial metal clips such as a Yasargil clip (YC, curved type, 8.3-mm long) and a Sugita clip (SC, straight type, 10-mm long). An in vivo animal study was performed with a canine venous pouch aneurysm model.
   RESULTS: The closing forces (N) at 1 mm and 8 mm from the blade tip were 2.09 and 3.77 in YC, 1.85 and 3.04 in SC, and 2.05 and 4.60 in ZC. The maximum opening widths (mm) was 6.8, 9.0, and 3.0 in YC, SC, and ZC, respectively. The in vitro artifact volumes of YC, SC, and ZC in time-of-flight MR imaging were 26.9, 29.7, and 1.9 times larger than the respective real volumes. The in vivo artifact volumes of YC, SC, and ZC were respectively 21.4, 29.4, and 2.6 times larger than real ones.
   CONCLUSIONS: ZC showed the smallest susceptibility artifacts and satisfactory closing forces. However, the narrow opening width of the blades was a weak point.

ID BRACHIAL-PLEXUS INJURY; NERVE ROOT AVULSION; DURAL REPAIR; MYELOGRAPHY;
   MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Traumatic cervical pseudomeningoceles (TCPs) occur secondary to traction of the cervical nerve roots resulting in violation of the dura. Surgical repair is not necessary in most cases because pseudomeningoceles have a high propensity to spontaneously resolve with conservative management alone. Currently, there are a limited number of cases of large TCPs (large is defined as >= 6 cm in greatest diameter), and there is no established guideline for the management of such lesions.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe the cases of 2 young men in their 20s who were involved in a motor vehicle accident. Both patients suffered a brachial plexus injury and developed large TCPs. Patient 1 was treated surgically for TCP using a combined intra-/extradural approach using a fascia lata graft. Patient 2 was ultimately treated nonsurgically because a spontaneous resolution of the pseudomeningocele was achieved over the period of 7 months after the accident. Both patients underwent brachial plexus repair surgery consisting of spinal accessory nerve transfer to the suprascapular nerve and intercostal nerve transfer to the musculocutaneous nerve.
   CONCLUSIONS: Disease progression of TCPs is a dynamic process, and even large lesions may spontaneously resolve without surgical intervention. When surgery is indicated, a definitive dural repair using a fascia lata graft to cover the dural tear intra-and extradurally is an effective method. Surgery must be planned carefully on a case-by-case basis, and close follow-up with thorough physical examination and serial imaging is critical to monitor disease progression.

ID PITUITARY ABSCESS
AB BACKGROUND: Fungal infection is a rare pathology in the sphenoid sinus, and extension into the pituitary fossa with visual loss has only been described in a few reports in the literature. Following publication of a recent report of pituitary abscess by Candida glabrata, we describe our own experience with a similar pathology. CASE
   DESCRIPTION: In the present report, we overview a diabetic patient who sustained aspergilloma in his sphenoid sinus with extension to the pituitary fossa. Clinical presentations are discussed along with an emphasis on the role of endoscopic endonasal drainage of the abscess as the mainstay of treatment. Following administration of intravenous amphotericin B for 6 days, endoscopic drainage of the aspergillus abscess was done. Visual acuity improved immediately after the operation. At the 12-month follow-up visit, the improvement in visual acuity was maintained and magnetic resonance imaging showed no recurrence.
   CONCLUSION: Correction of the underlying immune deficiencies, administration of intravenous antifungal agents perioperatively, endoscopic endonasal drainage of abscess, and a meticulous debridement of necrotic material, followed by a course of oral antifungal medication, comprises the standard treatment protocol for a fungus ball (aspergilloma) of the sphenoid sinus.

   UPDATE; CANCER
AB BACKGROUND: Nongestational choriocarcinoma (NGC) is a rare germ cell tumor, accounting for <0.6% of all gestational tumors, and has a poor prognosis when metastasized. NGC with metastasis to the brain is reported even less frequently. Gestational choriocarcinoma (GC) when metastasized to the brain has a higher morbidity and mortality but has been known to be a chemosensitive and radiosensitive lesion, and NGC is chemoresistant with an even worse prognosis. Currently, there is no consensus for treatment for metastatic NGC to the brain.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This 66-year-old postmenopausal female presented with left upper extremity weakness more pronounced in her hand and a workup demonstrating a hemorrhagic lesion over the right frontal parietal lobe. Her metastatic workup was negative, leading to a craniotomy for resection of the mass. The pathology was consistent with metastatic GC of nongestational origin.
   CONCLUSIONS: Because of its chemosensitive nature, reports of optimal metastatic GC treatment include radiation alone, chemotherapy without radiation, surgical resection, or combined multimodal therapy. No recommendations for NGC metastasized to the brain have been reported. We propose a systematic workup for hemorrhagic brain lesions to include the proposed imaging modalities and serum markers, including beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, to aid early diagnosis. Based on a review of the literature, we recommend surgical resection with adjuvant therapy for accessible symptomatic metastatic GC and NGC to the brain for optimal patient outcomes. Chemotherapy and radiation alone without surgical resection can be considered for asymptomatic GC metastasis to the brain.

ID ENDOCARDITIS
AB BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pluranimalium is a new and emerging animal streptococcal species associated with primary infection in bovine and avian species. Data in the literature regarding its pathogenic significance in human beings are limited. We hereby report a case of brain abscess caused by S. pluranimalium in a healthy adult male. S. pluranimalium, a causative agent of brain abscess, was unanticipated, and to the best of our knowledge, this is one of the rare cases reported in the medical literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 44-year-old male presented with headache and occasional episodes of vomiting for 2 weeks, weakness of the left upper and lower limbs for 1 week, and 1 episode of generalized tonic clonic seizure 2 days back. He was afebrile and had no history of loss of consciousness or head trauma. His physical and neurologic examination was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a focal ring enhancing lesion in right posterior parietal lobe, suggestive of infective etiology. The patient underwent right parietooccipital craniotomy and excision of cerebral abscess, from which S. pluranimalium was isolated. The patient responded to treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and metronidazole without any residual neurologic sequelae.
   CONCLUSION: Clinical data regarding epidemiology, pathogenic mechanisms, and zoonotic potential of S. pluranimalium in human beings are lacking. The number of cases of human infections with S. pluranimalium are steadily increasing. Hence further detailed study of the pathogenesis of S. pluranimalium in human beings is warranted, which may help to develop new strategies to prevent and treat infection with this bacterium.

AB Extracranial-to-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery may be necessary in patients with moyamoya disease and other ischemic conditions. However, there is a potential risk of wound-related complications in some cases. In this study, we report our approach to the prevention of wound-related complications in EC-IC bypass. Technical considerations and pitfalls of surgery are also discussed. This study included 89 patients with ischemic-onset moyamoya disease and atherosclerotic disease who underwent 108 superficial temporal artery (STA) etoemiddle cerebral artery bypass procedures. Our study emphasized 3 major features. First, 3-dimensional simulation imaging was used to confirm STA anatomy. Second, the STA was meticulously dissected on the epigaleal layer to protect the galeal layer. Third, scalp skin ischemia was taken into consideration at each step until skin closure. There was no neurologic morbidity or mortality in this series. There were 2 cases of major wound-related complications requiring plastic surgical intervention, and 4 cases of minor complications that were treated conservatively. In major complication cases, the scalp defect was treated with pedicle flap reconstruction. In EC-IC bypass surgery, interdisciplinary management involving neurosurgery, plastic surgery, and radiology should reduce wound-related complications and achieve safe surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: Outcomes of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) versus conventional craniotomy (CC) for patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) have not been compared previously. We reviewed the current evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of MIS compared with CC in patients with SICH.
   METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing MIS and CC in patients with computed tomography-confirmed SICH published between January 2000 and April 2018 in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register based on PRISMA inclusion and exclusion criteria. Binary outcomes comparisons between MIS and CC were described using odds ratios (ORs).
   RESULTS: Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 9 prospective controlled studies (non-RCTs), involving a total of 2466 patients, met our inclusion criteria. There was a statistically significant difference in mortality rate between MIS and CC (OR, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-0.97). MIS was associated with a lower rate of rebleeding (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.28-0.64) and a higher rate of good recovery compared with CC (OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.34-3.83).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SICH may benefit more from MIS than CC. Our study could help clinicians optimize treatment strategies in SICH.

AB BACKGROUND: The PulseRider is an innovative stent-like device designed for the treatment of intracranial bifurcation aneurysms. The aim of this study was to assess the current evidence on safety and effectiveness of the PulseRider.
   METHODS: A systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The following databases were searched: PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and Scopus. The search strategy consisted of "pulserider," "bifurcation aneurysm," and "endovascular" in both AND and OR combinations. Studies included were original research articles in peer-reviewed journals. The manuscripts were thoroughly examined for study design, outcomes, and results.
   RESULTS: Three studies were identified describing use of the PulseRider device in the treatment of 63 patients with 63 bifurcation aneurysms. We identified 2 multicenter case series and 1 single-arm clinical trial. The majority of aneurysms treated were located at the basilar tip (37, 58.7%). All devices were successfully deployed, and there were 5 intraoperative complications (7.9%), including 2 intraoperative aneurysm ruptures, 1 vessel dissection, and 2 thrombus formations. Immediate complete aneurysm occlusion was achieved in 61.9% (39/63) of cases and at the 6-month imaging follow-up, 66.7% (42/63) achieved complete aneurysm occlusion. One recanalization was reported in 1 of the multicenter case series within the 6-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: The PulseRider is safe and probably effective for the treatment of intracranial bifurcation aneurysms, sometimes not amenable for stent-assisted coiling. However, current evidence is limited to a small sample and short follow-up. In addition, the device has not been compared with other treatment modalities.

DE Denticulate ligament; Spinal meningioma; Spinal tumor
ID CLEAR-CELL MENINGIOMA; OF-THE-LITERATURE; CAUDA-EQUINA; MANAGEMENT;
   DIAGNOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: To control bleeding during spinal meningioma surgery, early resection of the dural attachment is important. We report a case of a meningioma where identifying the tumor's dural attachment was difficult because the tumor arose from the denticulate ligament. This report histopathologically and surgically describes this rare occurrence.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 38-year-old man presented with a mass lesion that was found during a follow-up examination for vestibular schwannoma surgery performed 2 years prior. He was neurologically free of symptoms except for right-sided deafness. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intradural extramedullary mass at the C1 level. The tumor had homogeneous enhancement after administration of gadolinium; however, no dural tail sign was seen. Schwannoma was diagnosed, and lesion resection was performed. The hard, white tumor was adherent to the denticulate ligament, and no dural attachment was found. The tumor was totally removed after resection of the denticulate ligament. Histopathologic investigation, based on immunoreactivity to epithelial membrane antigen, revealed that the tumor was a meningioma. In addition to normal fibrous tissue, the denticulate ligament was infiltrated by tumor cells. Based on histopathologic findings and the absence of a dural attachment, we suspect that this meningioma originated from the denticulate ligament.
   CONCLUSIONS: If it is difficult to find the dural attachment during spinal meningioma surgery, the possibility of a denticulate meningioma should be considered, and the attachment should be resected as soon as possible.

DE Collateral circulation; Dissecting aneurysm; Posterior inferior

ID DISSECTING ANEURYSMS; ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; CLINICAL-FEATURES;
   MANAGEMENT; ANATOMY
AB BACKGROUND: A dissecting aneurysm on the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) is a rare entity, and endovascular embolization is often adopted. During the procedure, if the parent artery is occluded, the distal PICA is usually supplied by the ipsilateral anterior inferior artery or contralateral PICA. In extremely rare circumstances, the distal PICA can establish collateral circulation by transdural anastomosis with the posterior meningeal artery (PMA).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 29-year-old woman was admitted complaining of thunderclap headache, nausea, and vomiting for 3 hours. Head computed tomography and digital subtraction angiography revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage and a dissecting aneurysm located at the tonsillomedullary segment of PICA. The parent artery distal to the aneurysm had no collateral circulation from the adjacent arteries. Selective endovascular coiling of the aneurysm with preservation of the parent artery was adopted for treatment. The patient experienced an uneventful postprocedural recovery. To our surprise, follow-up digital subtraction angiography 6 months later revealed complete occlusion of the aneurysm and parent artery at the site of aneurysm formation. A rare anastomosis between the distal PICA and PMA was established.
   CONCLUSIONS: A report about this rare condition suggested that after occlusion of the PICA trunk, the distal PICA can form collateral circulation with the PMA. A potential collateral circulation may be present in advance between the PICA and PMA. When ischemia occurs in the distal PICA, this collateral circulation may open and could be reconstructed and enlarged to provide blood supply.

TI Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome as an Unusual Complication
   of a Dural Arteriovenous Fistula treated with Onyx Embolization
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Endovascular; Headache; Onyx; Vasoconstriction
ID DIMETHYL-SULFOXIDE; ABSORPTION
AB BACKGROUND: Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is a rare entity with an unknown pathophysiology. RCVS has been reported to occur more frequently in women age 20-50 years. Several causative mechanisms have been postulated involving transient deregulation of cerebral arterial tone, small vessel endothelial dysfunction, biochemical factors, hormonal deregulation, oxidative stress, and genetic predisposition. All these mechanisms and triggers are related to sympathetic overactivation, which eventually produces vasoconstriction. RCVS is distinguished by acute severe recurrent thunderclap headaches with or without other neurologic symptoms. However, the diagnosis can be challenging, requiring a high level of suspicion by the clinician, and RCVS is often underdiagnosed.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present an unusual case of an 18-year-old female who developed RCVS after embolization of a dural arteriovenous fistula with onyx embolic material. Cerebral angiography was performed and verapamil was administered intra-arterially, resulting in a slight decrease in vasoconstriction with clinical improvement. The patient was maintained on oral verapamil during hospitalization. At a 7-month follow-up, the patient was neurologically stable, and cerebral angiography demonstrated no signs of vasoconstriction.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular procedures are a rare trigger for the development of RCVS and may be misdiagnosed. Prompt recognition of symptoms and diagnosis with treatment are necessary to reduce the risk of stroke. The management approach should be based on the premise of discontinuing precipitating drugs and administering calcium channel blocking agents.

AB OBJECTIVE: Carotid artery restenosis may occur after ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The aim of this study was to determine whether carotid artery stenting (CAS) or redo CEA is the optimal treatment for post-endarterectomy carotid restenosis.
   METHODS: Eligible studies for meta-analysis were identified through a search of PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane up to July 20, 2017. A meta-analysis was conducted with the use of random effects modeling. I-2 was used to assess for heterogeneity.
   RESULTS: Thirteen studies comprising 4163 patients were included. Risk for any type of cranial nerve injury was higher in the redo CEA group (odds ratio = 13.61; 95% confidence interval, 5.43-34.16; I-2 = 3.3%). Periprocedural and/or short-term (within 30 days) stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, temporary cranial nerve injury, and death rates were similar between the 2 revascularization approaches. During median follow-up of 28 months, CAS was associated with significantly lower risk for long-term recurrent carotid artery restenosis when defined as stenosis > 60% (odds ratio = 2.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-4.12; I-2 = 0%) or > 70% (odds ratio = 2.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-4.72; I-2 = 0%). No difference was identified in longterm target lesion revascularization rates between redo CEA and CAS.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with carotid restenosis after CEA can safely undergo both CAS and CEA with similar risks of periprocedural stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, and death. However, patients treated with CAS have a lower risk for a new restenosis and periprocedural cranial nerve injury.

AB BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a dismal disease managed in the first instance by surgical resection, temozolomide, and radiation. The role of repeat surgery at recurrence remains ill defined. This study aims to quantify the effect of repeat surgery in recurrent GBM on overall survival and determine if a trend in reported effect over time exists.
   METHODS: Searches of 7 electronic databases from inception to January 2018 were conducted following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. There were 2692 articles identified for screening. Prognostic hazard ratios (HRs) derived from multivariate regression analysis were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis of proportions and linear regression.
   RESULTS: Eight observational studies reporting prognostic HRs in 10 cohorts were included. They described 1906 recurrent GBM diagnoses, managed by surgery at primary diagnosis, with 709 (37%) undergoing further repeat surgery at recurrence. Repeat surgery was shown to confer a statistically significant survival advantage compared with no surgery at recurrence in the pooled cohort (HR, 0.722; P < 0.001). Newer studies trended toward a more superior prognostic advantage of repeat surgery compared with earlier studies (effect coefficient, 0.856; P = 0.012).
   CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis of contemporary literature suggests that repeat surgery at GBM recurrence in select patients confers a significant, prognostic overall survival advantage independent of other prognostic factors. Furthermore, newer studies are significantly more likely to suggest greater benefit than are older studies. The main limitation is the selection bias inherent in the cohorts pooled for analysis. Larger prospective randomized controlled studies are needed to validate the findings of this study and provide stratification for such benefit justified by quality of life metrics.

AB BACKGROUND: Since the 1980s, numerous operations have replaced posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) with human bone. These operations often involve expensive implants and complex procedures. Escalating expenditures in lumbar fusion surgery warrant re-evaluation of classical PLIF with allogeneic ilium and without instrumentation. The purpose of this study was to determine the long-term fusion rate and clinical outcomes of PLIF with allogeneic bone (allo-PLIF).
   METHODS: Between 1981 and 2006, 321 patients aged 12-80 years underwent 339 1-level or 2-level allo-PLIFs for degenerative instability and were followed for 1-28 years. Fusion status was determined by radiographs and as available, by computed tomography scans. Clinical outcome was assessed by the Economic/Functional Outcome Scale.
   RESULTS: Of the 321 patients, 308 were followed post-operatively (average 6.7 years) and 297 (96%) fused. Fusion rates were lower for patients with substance abuse (89%, P=0.007). Clinical outcomes in 87% of patients were excellent (52%) or good (35%). Economic/Functional Outcome Scale scores after initial allo-PLIF on average increased 5.2 points. Successful fusion correlated with nearly a 2-point gain in outcome score (P=0.001). A positive association between a patient characteristic and outcome was observed only with age 65 years and greater, whereas negative associations in clinical outcomes were observed with mental illness, substance abuse, heavy stress to the low back, or industrial injuries. The total complication rate was 7%.
   CONCLUSIONS: With 3 decades of follow-up, we found that successful clinical outcomes are highly correlated with solid fusion using only allogeneic iliac bone.

AB BACKGROUND: Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs)/hemangiopericytomas (HPCs) are highly vascularized tumors well known for malignant, invasive, and highly vascular features. To date, several studies have reported the preoperative imaging findings of SFTs/HPCs. In this study, computed tomography (CT) tumor values acquired from dynamic CT scan were selected to determine the tumor pathology of highly vascular tumors, such as SFTs/HPCs.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on patients with pathologically diagnosed meningiomas and SFTs/HPCs who had undergone a dynamic contrast CT scan. We assessed and compared the CT values of these tumors according to the pathology.
   RESULTS: From a total of 34 patients, 30 patients with meningiomas and 4 patients with HPCs were included. The mean CT values of SFTs/HPCs and angiomatous meningioma were statistically significantly higher than those of the other meningioma subtypes (P = 0.003). We also performed receiver operating characteristic curve analyses to detect an appropriate cutoff point for the CT value to differentiate tumor pathology, and the calculated threshold was 161 Hounsfield units (HU) (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 75%; area under the curve, 0.87; 95%, CI 0.75-0.99).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that obtaining a CT value is useful in determining highly vascular tumor pathology preoperatively. When considering neurosurgical extra-axial tumor removal, and when the CT value of tumors is >161 HU, then highly vascular tumors such as SFTs/HPCs or angiomatous meningiomas are likely, and this should be considered prior to surgical intervention and for risk assessment.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical and radiographic results of unilateral pedicle screw fixation (UPSF) and bilateral pedicle screw fixation (BPSF) after unilateral transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) for the treatment of lumbar degenerative disc diseases (DDDs).
   METHODS: A total of 63 patients who underwent UPSF or BPSF combined with unilateral TLIF at L4-L5 or L5-S1 in our hospital between 2014 and 2016 were included in this analysis. The perioperative outcomes and radiographic results were recorded at preoperative and postoperative follow-up. Fusion rates were determined according to the Bridwell-Lenke grading system. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and lumbar Japanese Orthopedic Association score.
   RESULTS: According to the perioperative assessment, the duration of operation, intraoperative and postoperative blood loss, duration of pain medication use, and hospital costs were significantly (P < 0.0001) lower in the UPSF group compared with the BPSF group. After a mean follow-up of 24 months, both the UPSF and BPSF groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) maintained disc height and segmental lordosis of the surgical segment and achieved similar clinical outcomes at the final postoperative follow-up. The impact on the cranial adjacent vertebral level was significantly (P < 0.05) less in the UPSF group than the BPSF group in the short term.
   CONCLUSIONS: UPSF techniques with TLIF can attain similar clinical efficiency as BPSF techniques in treating single-level low lumbar DDD, but with fewer surgical injuries and at lower cost. BPSF with TLIF likely causes more degeneration at the cranial adjacent segment compared with UPSF techniques. The long-term results require more study.

AB BACKGROUND: High-field intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become increasingly available in neurosurgery centers. There is little experience with combined intraoperative MRI and intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring (IONM). We report the first series, to our knowledge, of pediatric patients undergoing brain tumor surgery with 3T intraoperative MRI and IONM.
   METHODS: This pilot study included all consecutive children operated on for brain tumors between October 2013 and April 2016 in whom concomitant intraoperative MRI and somatosensory evoked potentials and motor evoked potentials were used. Neuromonitoring findings and related complications of all cases were retrospectively analyzed.
   RESULTS: During a 30-month period, 17 children (mean age 8.4 years; 3 girls) undergoing surgery met the study criteria. During intraoperative MRI, 483 IONM needles were left in place. Of these needles, 119 were located on the scalp, 94 were located above the chest, and 270 were located below the chest. Two complications with skin burns (first degree) were observed. In all patients, neuromonitoring was still reliable after MRI. In 1 case, a threshold increase for motor evoked potential stimulation (20 mA) was necessary after intraoperative MRI; in 2 cases, a reduction of 50% of the somatosensory evoked potential amplitude at the end of the surgery was observed compared with the values obtained before intraoperative MRI.
   CONCLUSIONS: The combination of intraoperative MRI and IONM can be safely used in pediatric patients. IONM data acquisition after intraoperative MRI was feasible and remained reliable.

AB BACKGROUND: Previous studies have been inconsistent regarding risk for intracranial aneurysm related to intracranial arterial fenestration. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the association between intracranial arterial fenestration and risk of aneurysm.
   METHODS: We performed a systematic review of PubMed and Embase through August 2017 for potentially relevant articles. Summary odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were pooled using a random-effects model.
   RESULTS: Of 446 articles found, 7 were selected for meta-analysis. Pooled odds ratios revealed an increased risk of aneurysm owing to fenestration of 1.50 (95% confidence interval, 0.61-3.71; P = 0.38). Subgroup analyses based on the population presenting with various indications suggested that pooled odds ratios indicated a significant increase in risk for aneurysm of 2.43 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-5.69; P = 0.04).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that intracranial arterial fenestration may be associated with increased risk for aneurysm formation.

Previously, we demonstrated in a rabbit model that low-dose PTH treatment resulted in increased fusion mass volume. As effects of PTH on bone are dose-dependent, we aimed to evaluate whether increasing dosage of PTH increases both volume and biomechanical stiffness of the resulting fusion masses and/or exhibits synergistic effects with low-dose bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2).
   METHODS: Posterolateral lumbar spinal fusion surgery was performed on 60 New Zealand White rabbits divided into 6 experimental groups: iliac crest autograft alone, autograft plus 20 mu g/kg/day PTH, autograft plus 40 mu g/kg/day PTH, BMP-2 alone, BMP-2 plus 20 mu g/kg/day PTH, and BMP-2 plus 40 mu g/kg PTH. Fusion was assessed at postoperative week 6 via manual palpation, volumetric computed tomography analysis, and 4-point bending biomechanical testing.
   RESULTS: All groups treated with BMP-2 fused. Increasing doses of PTH resulted in increased fusion mass volume compared with autograft alone. Autograft plus 40 mu g/kg/day PTH yielded fusion mass volumes comparable to BMP-2. When the autograft groups were considered alone, increased mechanical stiffness was observed only in the 20 mu g/kg/day group. No significant stiffness differences were observed between BMP-2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the highest dose of PTH resulted in fusion mass volumes similar to those obtained with BMP-2. When the autograft groups were considered alone, significant increases in mechanical stiffness were observed at a dosage of 20 mu g/kg/day, suggesting there may be an optimal dose of PTH in the rabbit model. Effects of BMP-2 on fusion were dominant.

AB BACKGROUND: Compared with temporal lobe epilepsy, the surgical outcome in extra-temporal lobe epilepsy (ETLE) is unsatisfactory. However, advances in diagnostic and surgical techniques have led to improved prognosis. This study investigated the outcomes and prognostic factors of ETLE based on long-term follow-up of patients undergoing surgical treatment for ETLE at a single institution.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 58 patients with refractory ETLE who underwent resection between 2003 and 2015. Clinical outcome was evaluated by Engel classification. Parameters analyzed as prognostic factors were clarity of the lesion on magnetic resonance imaging, completeness of resection, and histologic diagnoses.
   RESULTS: Of 58 patients (62.1%), 36 had a seizure-free state (Engel I) after surgery over a mean follow-up of 58 months. The most common pathology was cortical dysplasia (27 patients; 46.5%). In univariate analysis, only complete resection was a statistically significant prognostic factor (P = 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgery is effective treatment for ETLE (79.4%, Engel I and II). Complete resection predicts more satisfactory results in patients with intractable ETLE.

AB BACKGROUND: It is difficult to distinguish silent corticotroph adenomas (SCAs) from other nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs) preoperatively. This study aimed to determine the preoperative clinical parameters associated with SCAs.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective single-center study of patients who underwent surgery for NFPAs during 2011e 2016 in our tertiary hospital and who had preoperative combined pituitary function test (CPFT) and immunohistochemical staining results available. After we excluded patients with increased 24-hour urinary free cortisol to preclude overt Cushing's disease, 341 patients were finally enrolled. The medical records, including the CPFT and immunohistochemistry results, of the patients were reviewed.
   RESULTS: The age and tumor size were similar between patients with SCAs and other NFPAs. The SCA group had a greater proportion of women (89.2% vs. 57.6%, P < 0.001), cavernous sinus invasion (35.1% vs. 20.7%, P = 0.047), and intratumoral hemorrhage on preoperative sella magnetic resonance imaging (32.4% vs. 9.2%, P < 0.001) compared with the NFPA group. In the preoperative CPFT, the cortisol response was not significantly different between groups. However, the peak adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (67.80 +/- 49.83 vs. 85.67 +/- 78.97 pg/mL, P = 0.061) tended to be lower, and the DACTH (53.71 +/- 50.14 vs. 72.67 +/- 75.82 pg/mL, P = 0.046) was significantly lower in SCAs. After we excluded patients with preoperative hypopituitarism caused by mass effects, the peak ACTH (69.39 +/- 39.45 vs. 119.75 +/- 89.84 pg/mL, P = 0.001) and DACTH (58.58 +/- 36.51 vs. 107.66 +/- 86.05 pg/mL, P = 0.001) were significantly lower in SCAs than in other NFPAs.
   CONCLUSIONS: Female sex, cavernous sinus invasion, intratumoral hemorrhage on sella magnetic resonance imaging, and decreased ACTH response in the CPFT are independent indicators of SCAs.

AB OBJECTIVES: Aseptic bone flap resorption (ABFR) is a known complication of cranioplasty (CP) with an autologous bone flap. The incidence of ABFR has been reported to be as high as 34.2% in the literature; however, it is underestimated in clinical fields. We retrospectively reviewed 13 years of clinical cases of patients who underwent CP after decompressive craniectomy (DC) to investigate the incidence and risk factors of ABFR.
   METHODS: Ninety-one patients who underwent DC and CP in Guro Hospital, Korea University Medical Center, were enrolled. ABFR was defined using serial brain computed tomography. To identify possible risk factors for ABFR, univariate and multivariate Cox regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed.
   RESULTS: Of the 91 patients enrolled, ABFR was diagnosed in 32 patients (35.1%). Bone flap size, existence of a shunting system, and the DC-CP interval were significant in the univariate analysis. Bone flap size was statistically significant in the multivariate analysis (P = 0.0189). The cutoff points of the DC-CP interval and bone flap size were 44 days and 110 cm(2), respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of ABFR was remarkably high. Bone flap size, the existence of a shunting system, and the DC-CP interval were shown to be potential risk factors of ABFR after CP.

AB OBJECTIVE: To report clinical outcomes of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and vasospasm in angiogram-negative subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) according to hemorrhage patterns, perimesencephalic hemorrhage (PMH) and non-PMH.
   METHODS: Online databases from January 1990 to December 2017 were systematically reviewed. A fixed-effects model was used to control heterogeneity. To resolve publication bias, the trim and fill method was used to estimate number of missing studies and adjusted odds ratio (OR). Subgroup analysis of data from studies that defined angiogram-negative subarachnoid hemorrhage by angiography repeated at least twice or computed tomography angiography was performed.
   RESULTS: Among 24 studies including 2083 patients, 23/985 patients (2.3%) with PMH and 144/1098 patients (13.1%) with non-PMH had DCI, indicating that patients with PMH experienced significantly lower DCI than patients with non-PMH (OR = 0.219; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.144-0.334). Regarding vasospasm, 99/773 patients (12.8%) with PMH and 231/922 patients (25.1%) with non-PMH exhibited vasospasm, indicating that patients with PMH experienced significantly lower vasospasm than patients with non-PMH (OR = 0.445; 95% CI, 0.337-0.589). Funnel plots show asymmetry indicating possible publication bias. After trimming 10 studies for DCI and 7 for vasospasm, the adjusted ORs remained significant between PMH and lower risks of DCI and vasospasm. Subgroup analysis of 789 patients in 8 studies showed a lower risk of DCI (OR = 0.268; 95% CI, 0.151-0.473) and vasospasm (OR = 0.346; 95% CI, 0.221-0.538) in patients with PMH.
   CONCLUSIONS: PMH showed a significantly lower risk of DCI and vasospasm than non-PMH. Clinical outcomes of angiogram-negative subarachnoid hemorrhage, based on meta-analysis of individual patient data, need to be investigated.

AB OBJECTIVE: Cervical radiculopathy infrequently presents with motor weakness. Motor weakness was improved in >90% of patients after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion or posterior cervical foraminotomy. Posterior percutaneous endoscopic cervical foraminotomy and discectomy (PECF) is an alternative surgical technique, but the outcome of motor weakness has not been reported. Our objective was to demonstrate the longitudinal outcomes of motor weakness after PECF.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of 106 consecutive patients was performed. Preoperative motor weakness was graded as mild (IV/V strength) or severe (less than III/V strength). The patients visited the outpatient clinic at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery and yearly thereafter. Improvement was defined as an improved weakness of more than 1 grade, and normalization was defined as the recovery of complete motor strength.
   RESULTS: Motor weakness preoperatively presented in 76 of 106 (72%) patients (49%, mild weakness; 23%, severe weakness). After PECF, the weakness improved in 72 of 76 (95%) patients and normalized in 65 of 76 (86%) patients. In the patients with mild weakness, the normalization rates were 48%, 81%, 90%, and 96% at postoperative months 1, 3, 6, and 12, respectively. In the patients with severe weakness, the improvement rates were 50%, 71%, 83%, 88%, and 92%, and the normalization rates were 8%, 38%, 58%, 58%, and 63% at postoperative months 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative motor weakness was improved in 95% of the patients after PECF, but motor weakness was not normalized in 37% of the patients with severe weakness.

AB BACKGROUND: Animal models are commonly used in training protocols for microsurgical vascular anastomosis. Rat common carotid arteries (CCAs) are frequently used for this purpose. Much attention has been paid to the technical details of various anastomosis configurations using these arteries. However, technical nuances of exposing rat CCAs have been understudied. The purpose of this study is to describe nuances of technique for safely and efficiently exposing rat CCAs in preparation for a vascular anastomosis.
   METHODS: Bilateral CCAs were exposed and prepared for anastomosis in 10 anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats through a midline cervical incision. The exposed length of the CCA was measured. Additionally, technical nuances of exposure and surgically relevant anatomic details were recorded.
   RESULTS: The CCAs were exposed from the sternoclavicular joint to their bifurcation (average length, 19.1 +/- 2.8 mm). Tenets important for a safe and efficient exposure of the CCAs included 1) generous subcutaneous dissection to expose the external jugular veins (EJVs), 2) avoiding injury to or compression of the EJVs, 3) superior mobilization of the salivary glands, 4) division of internal jugular veins, 5) opening the carotid sheath at its midlevel and from medial to lateral, and 6) avoiding injury to the vagus nerve or sympathetic trunk.
   CONCLUSIONS: Using the principles introduced in this study, trainees may safely and efficiently expose rat CCAs in preparation for a bypass.

AB OBJECTIVE: Surgical or endovascular treatment for giant or complex aneurysms is challenging. The aims of this study were to evaluate clinical outcomes and factors affecting the prognosis of giant or complex aneurysms and to better establish the role of microsurgery in the management strategy.
   METHODS: One hundred fifty-nine patients with surgically treated complex aneurysms were included. Thirty-two patients (20.1%) had giant aneurysms (>= 25 mm) and 57 (35.8%) had large aneurysms (>= 15 mm). Poor outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale scores of 3-6.
   RESULTS: The mean aneurysm size was 17.0 mm (range, 1.6-47.5 mm). One hundred and sixteen aneurysms (80.0%) were in the anterior circulation and 43 (27.0%) were in the posterior circulation. One hundred and thirty-eight (86.8%) aneurysms were completely occluded without residual aneurysms. Nineteen (11.9%) had minor aneurysm remnants; 2 (1.3%) had incomplete occlusion. Two patients (1.3%) with giant basilar artery (BA) trunk aneurysms experienced rupture of the treated aneurysm and died. Bypass surgery was combined with microsurgery in 148 patients (93.1%). Perforating artery infarction was observed postoperatively in 42 patients (26.4%), and poor outcome was observed in 29 (18.2%). Male sex (P = 0.016; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 4.524 = 1.949-10.500]), perforating artery infarction (P < 0.001; adjusted OR, 13.625 = 5.329-34.837]), and BA aneurysm location (P = 0.003; adjusted OR, 56.333 [6.830-464.657]) were significantly related to poor outcome. The aneurysm size (P = 0.017; adjusted OR, 1.064 [1.021-1.107]), C1 aneurysm location (P = 0.042; adjusted OR, 2.591 [0.986-6.811]), and BA aneurysm location (P = 0.033; adjusted OR, 12.956 [3.197-52.505]) were significantly related to perforating artery infarction.
   CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgery with bypass is effective for many different complex aneurysms, except BA aneurysms.

AB OBJECTIVE: To report our experience of endoscopic disc removal by anterior approach for management of cervical myelopathy in 210 patients.
   METHODS: A retrospective study of 187 cases of single-and 23 cases of double-level disc disease was performed. Cases of myelopathy with or without unilateral or bilateral radiculopathy and unilateral radiculopathy with either soft or hard disc prolapse were included. Patients with >= 3 disc levels, unstable spine, infections, trauma, significant posterior compression, congenital canal stenosis, disc extending more than half the vertebral body height, and prior surgery at the same level were excluded.
   RESULTS: C5-6 (n = 119 patients), C6-7 (n = 58 patients), C4-5 (n = 49 patients), C3-4 (n = 6 patients), and C2-3 (n = 1 patient) levels were represented. Visual analog scale and Nurick grading system were used to assess severity of neck and arm pain and functional outcomes, respectively. Preoperative mean visual analog scale scores for arm and neck pain were 6.7 and 3.2, respectively, which improved to 1.7 and 1.1 at 3 months after surgery. The average preoperative Nurick grade improved from 2.64 to 0.81 at 6 months postoperatively. Follow-up was 6-54 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic anterior discectomy (disc preserving surgery) is an effective and safe alternative in cervical disc disease. Although there was reduction in disc height, clinical outcome was good at an average 29 months of follow-up. Long-term follow-up is required to assess any progressive disc degeneration and clinical results.

TI Clinical Significance of the Circle of Willis in Patients with

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Circle of Willis; Internal carotid artery; Occlusion; Stroke
ID EXTRACRANIAL-INTRACRANIAL BYPASS; STROKE; SURGERY; RISK
AB BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in medical treatment, many patients experience ischemic stroke owing to internal carotid artery occlusion. We retrospectively evaluated a novel method based on the arterial structure of the circle of Willis (CoW) to identify patients at a high risk of recurrent stroke.
   METHODS: The study enrolled 104 patients with symptomatic occlusion of the internal carotid artery. CoW integrity was evaluated by a quantitative scoring system based on conventional angiography. Patients were categorized into a good integrity (n = 45) or poor integrity (n [59) group. Primary endpoint was early neurologic deterioration, recurrent ischemic stroke, or transient ischemic attack.
   RESULTS: History of ischemic stroke before initial presentation was more prevalent in the poor integrity group (22.2% vs. 47.5%, P = 0.01), and there were no differences between the 2 groups in terms of stroke risk factors. Overall estimated rate of the primary endpoint was 25.6% 2 years after angiography. Itwas 5.7% in the good integrity group and 39.8% in the poor integrity group (P < 0.001). In a Cox regression analysis, male sex (P = 0.01, hazard ratio = 6.60), use of a tissue plasminogen activator (P = 0.00, hazard ratio = 6.10), and poor integrity of CoW (P = 0.00, hazard ratio = 5.42) were risk factors for the primary endpoint. Patients in the poor integrity group with decreased vascular reserve experienced frequent primary endpoint events compared with patients in the good integrity group (P = 0.00).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with poor integrity of CoW are vulnerable to recurrent ischemic stroke and appear to require more aggressive treatment.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to quantify the discrepancy between intraoperative and postoperative segmental lordosis in patients operated on for lumbar degenerative diseases, with 3 different fixation techniques: open posterolateral instrumentation alone (PLI) or in association with lumbar interbody cages (transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion [TLIF] or extreme lateral interbody fusion [XLIF]).
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all adult patients affected by single-segment degenerative spondylotic disease who underwent PLI alone or percutaneous posterolateral instrumentation (pPLI) in association with TLIF or XLIF between April 2015 and December 2017 at our institution. Group I included patients who underwent PLI with transpedicular screws and rods, interlaminar bilateral decompression, and posterolateral fusion with autologous bone chips. Group II included patients treated with pPLI + TLIF using a complete unilateral arthrectomy. Group III included patients operated on with minimally invasive retroperitoneal pPLI + XLIF.
   RESULTS: No major complications were reported. The mean segmental loss of lordosis values ranged from 9.17% to 12.28% in Group I, from 6.31%-9.43% in Group II, and from 3.05%-4.71% in Group III. The statistical analysis revealed that pPLI + XLIF maintained a higher segmental lordosis than PLI and pPLI + TLIF in each operated segment (P < 0.05). pPLI + TLIF was more effective than PLI in reducing the loss of lordosis at L4-L5 and at L5-S1 (P < 0.05) but not at L3-L4 (P = 0.12).
   CONCLUSIONS: The documented mismatch between the preoperative and postoperative lumbar lordosis might affect the clinical outcome. Its relevance depends on the surgical technique used at the single level.

AB BACKGROUND: Length of stay (LOS) after surgery for adult spinal deformity (ASD) is a critical period that allows for optimal recovery. Predictive models that estimate LOS allow for stratification of high-risk patients.
   METHODS: A prospectively acquired multicenter database of patients with ASD was used. Patients with staged surgery or LOS >30 days were excluded. Univariable predictor importance >= 0.90, redundancy, and collinearity testing were used to identify variables for model building. A generalized linear model was constructed using a training dataset developed from a bootstrap sample; patients not randomly selected for the bootstrap sample were selected to the training dataset. LOS predictions were compared with actual LOS to calculate an accuracy percentage.
   RESULTS: Inclusion criteria were met by 653 patients. The mean LOS was 7.9 +/- 4.1 days (median 7 days; range, 1-28 days). Following bootstrapping, 893 patients were modeled (653 in the training model and 240 in the testing model). Linear correlations for the training and testing datasets were 0.632 and 0.507, respectively. The prediction accuracy within 2 days of actual LOS was 75.4%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our model successfully predicted LOS after ASD surgery with an accuracy of 75% within 2 days. Factors relating to actual LOS, such as rehabilitation bed availability and social support resources, are not captured in large prospective datasets. Predictive analytics will play an increasing role in the future of ASD surgery, and future models will seek to improve the accuracy of these tools.

   MORBIDITY; MORTALITY; RUPTURE; SURGERY; COILING
AB BACKGROUND: Updated natural history studies that suggest anterior communicating artery aneurysms have a higher risk of rupture than formerly appreciated. As endo-vascular and open techniques advance, morbidity may fall to levels that suggest the feasibility of intervention even for small aneurysms. This study was conducted to assess the risk associated with treating smaller, unruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysms.
   METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 149 patients with unruptured anterior communicating aneurysms treated over a 6-year period was performed. Treatment was based on an estimate of the highest efficacy/lowest risk for each patient. Outcomes were recorded at 3 months and 1 year after treatment. The primary outcome measure was a modified Rankin scale score of >2 at 1 year, or persistent cognitive impairment confirmed by a neurologist.
   RESULTS: The average patient age was 61 years (range, 34-84 years), and the median aneurysm size was 5.5 mm (interquartile range, 4-7 mm). Clipping was performed in 98 patients (65.8%). Poor outcome was observed in 12 patients (8%). Neither aneurysm size nor treatment method was predictive of poor outcome. Both a history of coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction and age were most significantly associated with poor outcome (coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction: odds ratio [OR], 8.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.20-29.86; P = 0.002; age: OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.019-1.17; P = 0.013). Dichotomized for age >65 years, the odds of poor outcome increased nearly 11-fold (OR, 10.93; 95% CI, 2.29-52.03; P = 0.003).
   CONCLUSIONS: The risk associated with treating unruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysms in patients age <65 years is low. Comparing risk with natural history studies, these patients can be expected to outperform natural history within 5 years. Recognizing the risk of smaller anterior communicating artery aneurysms, these findings suggest that treatment of even small lesions may be beneficial.

AB OBJECTIVE: Pituitary apoplexy is an unpredictable complication caused by hemorrhage or infarction in a pituitary adenoma. We retrospectively analyzed the radiologic and clinical outcomes of patients with conservatively managed pituitary apoplexy.
   METHODS: A total of 32 patients who had undergone conservative treatment with high-dose corticosteroid replacement were enrolled in this study. This cohort study consisted of 20 male and 12 female patients. The median patient age was 60 years. Five patients had a previously diagnosed pituitary tumor, and one third of the patients had a history of hypertension.
   RESULTS: The median follow-up duration was 50 months. The median tumor volumes at the initial and final assessments were 2.75 cm(3) (range, 0.32-10.7 cm3) and 0.64 cm3 (range, 0-8.74 cm(3)), respectively. Complete radiographic regression occurred in 9 of the 32 patients, partial regression occurred in 14 patients, and no change in size or progression occurred in 9 patients. Eighteen of the 32 patients had visual disturbances at the initial presentation; in this subgroup, 17 patients showed improvement over the course of the study. One patient had newly developed diplopia related to tumor progression. Nineteen of the 32 patients had >= 1 hormonal deficiency at the initial assessment, 8 of whom recovered to normal endocrine status. Three patients developed a new hormonal deficiency during the follow-up, and 3 patients experienced tumor recurrence.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the regression of tumors related to pituitary apoplexy, with favorable ophthalmologic and endocrinologic recovery. Conservative management should be considered in patients without severe or progressive neuro-ophthalmic deficits.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with Zero-profile device (Zero-p) and traditional cervical plate-and-cage implant in the treatment of symptomatic adjacent segment disease (ASD) and to determine the optimal reoperation procedure.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 58 patients with symptomatic ASD after an initial ACDF surgery and who had undergone a reoperation with ACDF with Zero-p (n = 27) and cervical plate-and-cage (n = 31) at our medical center between January 2010 and December 2015.
   RESULTS: The Japanese Orthopaedic Association score, Neck Disability Index score, Visual Analog Scale score, C2-C7 Cobb angle, and disc height index demonstrated significant improvements compared with the preoperative in both Zero-p and plate-and-cage groups (P < 0.05). However, there were no differences between the two groups (P > 0.05). The reoperation time for the Zero-p group (83.4 +/- 18.9 min) was less than that for the plate-and-cage group (96.5 +/- 20.1 min), with significant difference (P < 0.05). Five patients (8.6%) had cage subsidence, and 14 patients (24.1%) had dysphagia after the reoperation. There was no statistical significance in the difference between the 2 groups in cage subsidence (P > 0.05). However, the incidence of dysphagia in the plate-and-cage group (38.7%) was higher than in the Zero-p group (7.4%), with a significant difference (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: ACDF with Zero-p obtaining the same surgical efficacy, compared with traditional cervical plateand-cage, can significantly shorten the reoperation time and reduce the incidence of postoperative dysphagia. This option may be preferable for symptomatic patients with ASD qualifying for the anterior approach, in terms of biomechanics and surgical outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: Successful recanalization (SR) of the occluded artery does not always translate into a good outcome for patients with acute anterior circulation large-vessel occlusion stroke. This study aimed to develop a scale to predict poor outcome early despite SR after endovascular treatment (EVT) for candidates identified using current guidelines.
   METHODS: The eligible patients with SR were retrospectively enrolled between 2014 and 2016. Poor outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale of 3 to 6 at 90 days. Multivariable logistic regression was used to derive a PooR outcomE of enDovascular treatment wIth suCcessful recanalizaTion (PREDICT) scale. The discrimination and calibration of the scale were assessed.
   RESULTS: A total of 332 patients were enrolled. The PREDICT scale consisted of 5 items (prior intravenous thrombolysis, collateral status, blood glucose, blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score). The scale had good discrimination and calibration. The risk of poor outcome was stratified into very low (PREDICT scale score <= 5), low (6-8), moderate (9-11), and high (>= 12). Compared with patients with a score of <= 5, patients with a score of >= 12 had an 18.33-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.36-52.89) increased risk of poor outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: The PREDICT scale is a practical tool for early prediction of poor outcome despite SR after EVT in our patients and, if validated in other patient populations, may serve as a scale for identifying which patients are most, and least, likely to benefit from EVT.

AB OBJECTIVE: To observe outcomes of anterior controllable antedisplacement fusion (ACAF) in treatment of degenerative kyphosis with stenosis (DKS) and analyze probability of C5 nerve palsy.
   METHODS: From 2016 to 2017, a consecutive cohort of adults with DKS underwent ACAF. All patients underwent cervical radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Operative duration, blood loss, and hospital stay were estimated. Radiologic assessment included kyphotic correction, decompression width, and spinal canal area. Postoperative curvature of spinal cord was observed on sagittal magnetic resonance imaging. Japanese Orthopaedic Association score was used to evaluate neurologic status. C5 nerve palsy and other complications were recorded.
   RESULTS: The study included 49 patients. There was significant kyphosis correction postoperatively (-19.4 degrees vs. 3.5 degrees, P < 0.01). On cross-sectional computed tomography, mean decompression width was 19.0 mm, and spinal canal area was 218.5 mm(2). On sagittal magnetic resonance imaging, spinal cord curvature was classified into 5 types: type I, lordosis; type II, straight with no shifting; type III, straight with shifting; type IV, sigmoid; and type V, kyphosis. After ACAF, the spinal cord was maintained in good curvature with no shifting in all patients. No patient presented with C5 nerve palsy. Mean postoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association score was significantly better than preoperatively (14.9 points vs. 9.0 points, P < 0.01), with mean improvement rate of 79.8%.
   CONCLUSIONS: ACAF provides in situ decompression and good curvature to the spinal cord. Good neurologic recovery is obtained with lower incidence of C5 nerve palsy when ACAF is used to treat DKS.

ID CLINICAL PATHWAY PATTERNS; PROCESS MODELS; RETRIEVAL
AB Many medical information systems record data about the executed process instances in the form of an event log. In this paper, we present a framework, able to convert actions in the event log into higher level concepts, at different levels of abstraction, on the basis of domain knowledge. Abstracted traces are then provided as an input to trace comparison and semantic process discovery. Our abstraction mechanism is able to manage non trivial situations, such as interleaved actions or delays between two actions that abstract to the same concept. Trace comparison resorts to a similarity metric able to take into account abstraction phase penalties, and to deal with quantitative and qualitative temporal constraints in abstracted traces. As for process discovery, we rely on classical algorithms embedded in the framework ProM, made semantic by the capability of abstracting the actions on the basis of their conceptual meaning. The approach has-been tested in stroke care, where we adopted abstraction and trace comparison to cluster event logs of different stroke units, to highlight (in)correct behavior, abstracting from details. We also provide process discovery results, showing how the abstraction mechanism allows to obtain stroke process models more easily interpretable by neurologists.

AB End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the final stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and requires hemodialysis (HD) for survival. Intradialytic blood pressure (IBP) measurements are necessary to ensure patient safety during HD treatments and have critical clinical and prognostic significance. Studies on IBP measurements, especially IBP patterns, are limited. All related studies have been based on a priori knowledge and artificially classified IBP patterns. Therefore, the results were influenced by subjective concepts. In this study, we proposed a new approach to identify IBP patterns to classify ESRD patients. We used the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm to measure the similarity between two series of IBP data. Five blood pressure (BP) patterns were identified by applying the density peak clustering algorithm (DPCA) to the IBP data. To illustrate the association between BP patterns and prognosis, we constructed three random survival forest (RSF) models with different covariates. Model accuracy was improved 3.7-6.3% by the inclusion of BP patterns. The results suggest that BP patterns have critical clinical and prognostic significance regarding the risk of cerebrovascular events. We can also apply this clustering approach to other time series data from electronic health records (EHRs). This work is generalizable to analyses of dense EHR data.

AB Objective: To test a systematic methodology to monitor longitudinal change patterns on quality, productivity, and safety outcomes during a large-scale commercial Electronic Health Record (EHR) implementation.
   Materials and Methods: Our method combines an interrupted time-series design with control sites and 41 consensus outcomes including quality (11 measures), productivity (20 measures), and safety (10 measures). The intervention consisted of a phased commercial EHR implementation at a large health care delivery network. Four medium-size hospitals and 39 clinics from 5 geographic regions implementing the new EHR were compared against a parallel control consisting of one medium-size and one large hospital and 10 clinics that had not implemented the new EHR at the time of this study. We collected monthly data from February 2013 to July 2017.
   Results: The proposed methodology was successfully implemented and significant changes were observed in most measured variables. A significant change attributable to the intervention was observed in 12 (29%) measures in three or more regions; in 32 (78%) measures in two or more regions; and in 40 (98%) measures in at least one region. A similar pattern (i.e., same impact in three or more regions) was detected for nine (22%) measures, a mixed pattern (i.e., same impact in two regions, and different impact in other regions) was detected for nine (22%) measures, and an inconsistent pattern (i.e., did not detect the same impact across regions) was detected for 23 (56%) measures.
   Discussion: Using a formal methodology to assess changes in a set of consensus measures, we detected various patterns of impact and mixed time-sensitive effects. With an increasing adoption of EHR systems, it is critical for health care organizations to systematically monitor their EHR implementations. The proposed method provides a robust and consistent approach to monitor EHR implementations longitudinally allowing for continuous monitoring after the system becomes stable in order to avoid unexpected effects.
   Conclusion: Our results and methodology can guide the broader medical and informatics communities by informing what and how to continuously monitor EHR impact on quality, productivity, and safety.

AB Recently, the online social networks (OSNs) have received considerable attentions as a revolutionary platform to offer users massive social interaction among users that enables users to be more involved in their own healthcare. The OSNs have also promoted increasing interests in the generation of analytical, data models in health informatics. This paper aims at developing an obesity identification, analysis, and estimation model, in which each individual user is regarded as an online social network 'sensor' that can provide valuable health information. The OSN-based obesity analytic model requires each sensor node in an OSN to provide associated features, including dietary habit, physical activity, integral/incidental emotions, and self-consciousness. Based on the detailed measurements on the correlation of obesity and proposed features, the OSN obesity analytic model is able to estimate the obesity rate in certain urban areas and the experimental results demonstrate a high success estimation rate. The measurements and estimation experimental findings created by the proposed obesity analytic model show that the online social networks could be used in analyzing the local spatial obesity problems effectively.

AB Objective: Word embeddings project semantically similar terms into nearby points in a vector space. When trained on clinical text, these embeddings can be leveraged to improve keyword search and text highlighting. In this paper, we present methods to refine the selection process of similar terms from multiple EMR-based word embeddings, and evaluate their performance quantitatively and qualitatively across multiple chart review tasks.
   Materials and methods: Word embeddings were trained on each clinical note type in an EMR. These embeddings were then combined, weighted, and truncated to select a refined set of similar terms to be used in keyword search and text highlighting. To evaluate their quality, we measured the similar terms' information retrieval (IR) performance using precision-at-K (P@5, P@10). Additionally a user study evaluated users' search term preferences, while a timing study measured the time to answer a question from a clinical chart.
   Results: The refined terms outperformed the baseline method's information retrieval performance (e.g., increasing the average P@5 from 0.48 to 0.60). Additionally, the refined terms were preferred by most users, and reduced the average time to answer a question.
   Conclusions: Clinical information can be more quickly retrieved and synthesized when using semantically similar term from multiple embeddings.

TI Evaluation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems to annotate drug
   product labeling with MedDRA terminology
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Pharmacovigilance; FDA; MedDRA; Labeling; Drug Safety
ID SURVEILLANCE; INFORMATION
AB Introduction: The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) is a primary data source for identifying unlabeled adverse events (AEs) in a drug or biologic drug product's postmarketing phase. Many AE reports must be reviewed by drug safety experts to identify unlabeled AEs, even if the reported AEs are previously identified, labeled AEs. Integrating the labeling status of drug product AEs into FAERS could increase report triage and review efficiency. Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) is the standard for coding AE terms in FAERS cases. However, drug manufacturers are not required to use MedDRA to describe AEs in product labels. We hypothesized that natural language processing (NLP) tools could assist in automating the extraction and MedDRA mapping of AE terms in drug product labels.
   Materials and methods: We evaluated the performance of three NLP systems, (ETHER, 12E, MetaMap) for their ability to extract AE terms from drug labels and translate the terms to MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs). Pharmacovigilance-based annotation guidelines for extracting AE terms from drug labels were developed for this study. We compared each system's output to MedDRA PT AE lists, manually mapped by FDA pharma-covigilance experts using the guidelines, for ten drug product labels known as the "gold standard AE list" (GSL) dataset. Strict time and configuration conditions were imposed in order to test each system's capabilities under conditions of no human intervention and minimal system configuration. Each NLP system's output was evaluated for precision, recall and F measure in comparison to the GSL. A qualitative error analysis (QEA) was conducted to categorize a random sample of each NLP system's false positive and false negative errors.
   Results: A total of 417, 278, and 250 false positive errors occurred in the ETHER, 12E, and MetaMap outputs, respectively. A total of 100, 80, and 187 false negative errors occurred in ETHER, 12E, and MetaMap outputs, respectively. Precision ranged from 64% to 77%, recall from 64% to 83% and F measure from 67% to 79%. 12E had the highest precision (77%), recall (83%) and F measure (79%). ETHER had the lowest precision (64%). MetaMap had the lowest recall (64%). The QEA found that the most prevalent false positive errors were context errors such as "Context error/General term", "Context error/Instructions or monitoring parameters", "Context error/Medical history preexisting condition underlying condition risk factor or contraindication", and "Context error/AE manifestations or secondary complication". The most prevalent false negative errors were in the "Incomplete or missed extraction" error category. Missing AE terms were typically due to long terms, or terms containing non-contiguous words which do not correspond exactly to MedDRA synonyms. MedDRA mapping errors were a minority of errors for ETHER and 12E but were the most prevalent false positive errors for MetaMap.
   Conclusions: The results demonstrate that it may be feasible to use NLP tools to extract and map AE terms to MedDRA PTs. However, the NLP tools we tested would need to be modified or reconfigured to lower the error rates to support their use in a regulatory setting. Tools specific for extracting AE terms from drug labels and mapping the terms to MedDRA PTs may need to be developed to support pharmacovigilance. Conducting research using additional NLP systems on a larger, diverse GSL would also be informative.

AB The need to characterize and assess health apps has inspired a significant amount of research in the past years, in search for methods able to provide potential app users with relevant, meaningful knowledge. This article presents an overview of the recent literature in this field and categorizes - by discussing some specific examples - the various methodologies introduced so far for the identification, characterization, and assessment of health apps. Specifically, this article outlines the most significant web-based resources for app identification, relevant frameworks for descriptive characterization of apps' features, and a number of methods for the assessment of quality along its various components (e.g., evidence base, trustworthiness, privacy, or user engagement). The development of methods to characterize the apps' features and to assess their quality is important to define benchmarks and minimum requirements. Similarly, such methods are important to categorize potential risks and challenges in the field so that risks can be minimized, whenever possible, by design. Understanding methods to assess apps is key to raise the standards of quality of health apps on the market, towards the final goal of delivering apps that are built on the pillars of evidence-base, reliability, long-term effectiveness, and user-oriented quality.

ID SEVERITY; SCALE
AB To help clinicians to efficiently diagnose the severity of a person's depression, the affective computing community and the artificial intelligence field have shown a growing interest in designing automated systems. The speech features have useful information for the diagnosis of depression. However, manually designing and domain knowledge are still important for the selection of the feature, which makes the process labor consuming and subjective. In recent years, deep-learned features based on neural networks have shown superior performance to hand-crafted features in various areas. In this paper, to overcome the difficulties mentioned above, we propose a combination of hand-crafted and deep-learned features which can effectively measure the severity of depression from speech. In the proposed method, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) are firstly built to learn deep-learned features from spectrograms and raw speech waveforms. Then we manually extract the state-of-the-art texture descriptors named median robust extended local binary patterns (MRELBP) from spectrograms. To capture the complementary information within the hand-crafted features and deep-learned features, we propose joint fine-tuning layers to combine the raw and spectrogram DCNN to boost the depression recognition performance. Moreover, to address the problems with small samples, a data augmentation method was proposed. Experiments conducted on AVEC2013 and AVEC2014 depression databases show that our approach is robust and effective for the diagnosis of depression when compared to state-of-the-art audio-based methods.

AB Deep learning models (aka Deep Neural Networks) have revolutionized many fields including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and is being increasingly used in clinical healthcare applications. However, few works exist which have benchmarked the performance of the deep learning models with respect to the state-of-the-art machine learning models and prognostic scoring systems on publicly available healthcare datasets. In this paper, we present the benchmarking results for several clinical prediction tasks such as mortality prediction, length of stay prediction, and ICD-9 code group prediction using Deep Learning models, ensemble of machine learning models (Super Learner algorithm), SAPS II and SOFA scores. We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) (v1.4) publicly available dataset, which includes all patients admitted to an ICU at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from 2001 to 2012, for the benchmarking tasks. Our results show that deep learning models consistently outperform all the other approaches especially when the 'raw' clinical time series data is used as input features to the models.

AB In previous research, we have demonstrated for a number of ontologies that structurally complex concepts (for different definitions of "complex") in an ontology are more likely to exhibit errors than other concepts. Thus, such complex concepts often become fertile ground for quality assurance (QA) in ontologies. They should be audited first. One example of complex concepts is given by "overlapping concepts" (to be defined below.) Historically, a different auditing methodology had to be developed for every single ontology. For better scalability and efficiency, it is desirable to identify family-wide QA methodologies. Each such methodology would be applicable to a whole family of similar ontologies. In past research, we had divided the 685 ontologies of BioPortal into families of structurally similar ontologies. We showed for four ontologies of the same large family in BioPortal that "overlapping concepts" are indeed statistically significantly more likely to exhibit errors. In order to make an authoritative statement concerning the success of "overlapping concepts" as a methodology for a whole family of similar ontologies (or of large subhierarchies of ontologies), it is necessary to show that "overlapping concepts" have a higher likelihood of errors for six out of six ontologies of the family. In this paper, we are demonstrating for two more ontologies that "overlapping concepts" can successfully predict groups of concepts with a higher error rate than concepts from a control group. The fifth ontology is the Neoplasm sub hierarchy of the National Cancer Institute thesaurus (NCIt). The sixth ontology is the Infectious Disease sub hierarchy of SNOMED CT. We demonstrate quality assurance results for both of them. Furthermore, in this paper we observe two novel, important, and useful phenomena during quality assurance of "overlapping concepts." First, an erroneous "overlapping concept" can help with discovering other erroneous "non-overlapping concepts" in its vicinity. Secondly, correcting erroneous "overlapping concepts" may turn them into "non-overlapping concepts." We demonstrate that this may reduce the complexity of parts of the ontology, which in turn makes the ontology more comprehensible, simplifying maintenance and use of the ontology.

AB Health information exchanges (HIEs) are multisided platforms that facilitate the sharing of patient health information (PHI) between providers and payers across organizations within a region, community or hospital system. The benefits of HIEs to payers and providers include lower cost, faster services, and better health outcome. However, most HIEs have configured the patient healthcare consent process to give all providers who sign up with the exchange access to PHI for all consenting patients, leaving no control to patients in customized what information to share and with who. This research investigates the impact of granting greater control to patients in sharing their personal health information on consent rates and making them active participants in the HIEs system. This research utilizes a randomized experimental survey design study. The study uses responses from 388 participants and structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the conceptual model. The Main findings of this research include that patients consent rate increases significantly when greater control in sharing PHI is offered to the patient. In addition, greater control reduces the negative impact of privacy concern on the intention to consent. Similarly, trust in healthcare professionals leads to higher consent when greater control is offered to the patient. Thus, greater control empowers the role of trust in engaging patients and sustaining HIEs. The paper makes a theoretical contribution to research by extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model. The findings impact practice by providing insights that will help sustain HIEs.

AB Methods based on microarrays (MA), mass spectrometry (MS), and machine learning (ML) algorithms have evolved rapidly in recent years, allowing for early detection of several types of cancer. A pitfall of these approaches, however, is the overfitting of data due to large number of attributes and small number of instances a phenomenon known as the 'curse of dimensionality'. A potentially fruitful idea to avoid this drawback is to develop algorithms that combine fast computation with a filtering module for the attributes. The goal of this paper is to propose a statistical strategy to initiate the hidden nodes of a single-hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) by using both the knowledge embedded in data and a filtering mechanism for attribute relevance. In order to attest its feasibility, the proposed model has been tested on five publicly available high dimensional datasets: breast, lung, colon, and ovarian cancer regarding gene expression and proteomic spectra provided by cDNA arrays, DNA microarray, and MS. The novel algorithm, called adaptive SLFN (aSLEN), has been compared with four major classification algorithms: traditional ELM, radial basis function network (RBF), single-hidden layer feedforward neural network trained by backpropagation algorithm (BP-SLFN), and support vector-machine (SVM). Experimental results showed that the classification performance of aSLFN is competitive with the comparison models.

AB Sequences of events have often been modeled with computational techniques, but typical preprocessing steps and problem settings do not explicitly address the ramifications of timestamped events. Clinical data, such as is found in electronic health records (EHRs), typically comes with timestamp information. In this work, we define event sequences and their properties: synchronicity, evenness, and co-cardinality; we then show how asynchronous, uneven, and multi-cardinal problem settings can support explicit accountings of relative dine. Our evaluation uses the temporally sensitive clinical use case of pediatric asthma, which is a chronic disease with symptoms (and lack thereof) evolving over time. We show several approaches to explicitly incorporating relative time into a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that improve the overall classification of patients into those with no asthma, those with persistent asthma, those in long-term remission, and those who have experienced relapse. We also compare and contrast these results with those in an inpatient intensive care setting.

   IMPLEMENTATION
AB Background: A clinical pathway (CP) defines a standardized care process for a well-defined patient group that aims to improve patient outcomes and promote patient safety. However, the construction of a new pathway from scratch is a time-consuming task for medical staff because it involves many factors, including objects, multi-disciplinary collaboration, sequential design, and outcome measurements. Recently, the rapid development of hospital information systems has allowed the storage of large volumes of electronic medical records (EMRs), and this information constitutes an abundant data resource for building CPs using data-mining methods.
   Methods: We provide an automatic method for extracting typical treatment processes from EMRs that consists of four key steps. First, a novel similarity method is proposed to measure the similarity of two treatment records. Then, we perform an affinity propagation (AP) clustering algorithm to cluster doctor order set sequences (DOSSs). Next, a framework is proposed to extract a high-level description of each treatment cluster. Finally, we evaluate the extracted typical treatment processes by matching the treatment cluster with external information, such as the treatment efficacy, length of stay, and treatment cost.
   Results: By experiments on EMRs of 8287 cerebral infarction patients, it is concluded that our proposed method can effectively extract typical treatment processes from treatment records, and also has great potential to improve treatment outcome by personalizing the treatment process for patients with different conditions.
   Conclusion: The extracted typical treatment processes are intuitive and can provide managerial guidance for CP redesign and optimization. In addition, our work can assist clinicians in clearly understanding their routine treatment processes and recommend optimal treatment pathways for patients.

TI A detailed analysis of the Arden Syntax expression grammar
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Arden Syntax; Medical Logic Modules; Domain-specific language
ID MEDICAL LOGIC MODULES; PLATFORM; COMPILER
AB Objective: The Arden Syntax for Medical Logic Systems is a standard for encoding and sharing medical knowledge in the form of Medical Logic Modules. To improve accessibility for clinicians, the originators of the standard deliberately designed Arden Syntax expressions to resemble natural language, and parentheses around operands are not generally required. For certain patterns of nested expressions, however, the use of parentheses is mandatory, otherwise they are not accepted by an Arden Syntax environment. In this study, we refer to such patterns as anomalies. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent and the circumstances of such anomalies, and to outline a solution based on an alternative grammar encoding approach.
   Methods: To analyze the distribution of anomalies in nested expressions, we developed two custom-made complementary utilities. The first utility, termed parser, checks a single expression pattern against the specification-compliant grammar for syntactic correctness. The second utility, termed composer, automatically creates an extensive amount of expression patterns by permuting and nesting operators without the use of parentheses, and stores these together with the expected syntactic correctness. By means of these utilities we conducted a comprehensive analysis of anomalies by comparing the expected correctness with the actual correctness. Any detected anomalies are stored into a set of files, grouped by the respective top-level operator, for a subsequent analysis.
   Results: The composer utility nested 165 unary, binary, or ternary operators of Arden Syntax version 2.8 to a depth of two, resulting in a set of 76,533 expression patterns, of which 18,978 (24.8%) have been identified as anomalies. An automated assessment of their practical relevance for medical knowledge encoding is infeasible. Manual screening of selected samples indicated that only a small proportion of the detected anomalies would be relevant. The cause of the anomalies lies in the encoding of the grammar. A change of the basic encoding approach with some additional customizations eliminates the anomalies. A working expression parser is included in the supplementary material.
   Conclusion: Arden Syntax expressions are affected by anomalies. Since only a small proportion of them have practical relevance and they cannot cause false calculations or clinical decisions, their practical impact is likely limited. However, they may be potential points of confusion for knowledge engineers. An alternative expression grammar, based on a different encoding approach, would not only eliminate the anomalies, but could considerably facilitate both maintenance and further development of the standard.

AB Rooted deeply in medical multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM), risk assessment is very important especially when applied to the risk of being affected by deadly diseases such as coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD risk assessment is a stochastic, uncertain, and highly dynamic process influenced by various known and unknown variables. In recent years, there has been a great interest in fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), a popular methodology for dealing with uncertainty in MCDM. This paper proposes a new FAHP, bimodal fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (BFAHP) that augments two aspects of knowledge, probability and validity, to fuzzy numbers to better deal with uncertainty. In BFAHP, fuzzy validity is computed by aggregating the validities of relevant risk factors based on expert knowledge and collective intelligence. By considering both soft and statistical data, we compute the fuzzy probability of risk factors using the Bayesian formulation. In BFAHP approach, these fuzzy validities and fuzzy probabilities are used to construct a reciprocal comparison matrix. We then aggregate fuzzy probabilities and fuzzy validities in a pairwise manner for each risk factor and each alternative. BFAHP decides about being affected and not being affected by ranking of high and low risks. For evaluation, the proposed approach is applied to the risk of being affected by CHD using a real dataset of 152 patients of Iranian hospitals. Simulation results confirm that adding validity in a fuzzy manner can accrue more confidence of results and clinically useful especially in the face of incomplete information when compared with actual results. Applying the proposed BFAHP on CHD risk assessment of the dataset, it yields high accuracy rate above 85% for correct prediction. In addition, this paper recognizes that the risk factors of diastolic blood pressure in men and high-density lipoprotein in women are more important in CHD than other risk factors.

AB The availability of lanthanide ciprofloxacin complexes and the exploration of efficient new ways to the target species have made fluorescent signals as essential tools for chemical sensing. Both terbium (III) and europium (III) compounds possess easily distinguished, line-like emission bands occurring in the green and red region respectively. Based on the steps of ionizations and the coordination structure changes, the two molecular probes give rise to unique pH-sensitivities at different conditions. The photoluminescence properties of the mixture for the two complexes are demonstrated. At pH from 3 to 6, the Eu(III) emission is found to be less affected and the solution emits blue light in acidic environment (pH = 3). The terbium (III) characteristic luminescence exhibited off-on changes within a narrow pH range (pH = 5-6). Further spectroscopic pH titrations (pH from 6 to 10) are performed and the Eu (III) red emission has been significantly improved. The molecular-based probes have excellent water solubility, negligible cytotoxicity and enough permeability to across cell membrane. Such pHresponsive performance has been carried out for the investigation of intracellular pH measurement and these novel pH indicators were considered to be suitable for detecting bio-medical samples.

AB In this research, fabrication of high-performance UVC photodiodes based on Al: ZnO thin films is reported. AZO thin films were prepared through sol - gel based chemical routes (using organic precursors) followed by a spin coating method. The layers play a role of the n-type semiconductor deposited on the p-type silicon substrate which formed a p-n heterojunction. Optimizing the percentage of dopants, salt concentration, as well as deposition conditions, is essential for achieving high efficiency and reliable devices. For this aim, different samples were characterized under illumination of an ultraviolet source (254 nm, 268.27 mu Wcm(-2)). Then, I-V curves and photoresponsivity of the samples were recorded. A comparison between the results indicates that the sample prepared with a soil concentration of 1 M zinc acetate contains about 2 at, % aluminum has the highest responsivity among the others. Also, studying the photoluminescence spectra of the optimized sample demonstrates that it is significantly sensitive to the wavelength of 260 NM in UVC region. Moreover, the photocurrent to dark current ratio of 1.6 x 10(3), was measured for the most sensitive sample (with 2 at. % Al). In addition, the highest amount of quantum efficiency about 81% was also determined for this sample.

AB Scintillation properties of Czochralski-grown Gd-3(Al5-xGax)O-12:Ce (x = 2.3, 2.6, 3.0) single crystals were investigated. With increasing Ga content in garnet host, the radioluminescence band due to 5d(1)-> 4f emission transition was blue-shifted due to a decrease in the crystal field splitting of the 5 d levels. At 662 keV gamma rays, the LY value of 47,000, 55,100 and 51,900 ph/MeV was obtained for Gd3Al2.7Ga2.3O12:Ce, Gd3Al2.4Ga2.6O12:Ce and Gd3Al2Ga3O12:Ce, respectively. In spite of a lower LY value, Gd3Al2.7Ga2.3O12:Ce shows good energy resolution of 4.1% due to its proportionality of LY. The ratio of LY values under excitation with alpha- and gamma-rays (alpha/gamma ratio) was also determined. The fast component decay time with relative intensity of 146 ns (66%), 142 ns (76%) and 112 ns (76%) was measured in the scintillation decay of Gd3Al2.7Ga2.3O12:Ce, Gd3Al2.4Ga2.6O12:Ce and Gd3Al2Ga3O12:Ce, respectively. Good coincidence time resolution of Gd3Al2Ga3O12:Ce is due to a high initial photon emission rate.

AB In present work, we report the synthesis of stable ZnO nanocolloids through a simple solution method which exhibit enhanced optical limiting threshold. The influences of reaction temperature on the crystal structure as well as linear and nonlinear optical properties of prepared ZnO nanoparticles were carried out. The XRD and Raman analysis reveal that the prepared ZnO nanoparticles retain the hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure. HRTEM analysis confirms the effect of reaction temperature, solvent effect on crystallinity as well as nanostructure of ZnO nanoparticles. It has been found that crystallinity and average diameter increase with reaction temperature where ethylene glycol act as both solvent and growth inhibiter. EDS spectra shows formation of pure ZnO nanoparticles. The direct energy band gap of the nanoparticles increases with decrease in particle size due to quantum confinement effect. The third order nonlinear optical properties of ZnO nanoparticles were investigated by z scan technique using a frequency doubled Nd-YAG nanosecond laser at 532 nm wavelength. The z-scan result reveals that the prepared ZnO nanoparticles exhibit self - defocusing nonlinearity. The two photon absorption coefficient and third - order nonlinear optical susceptibility increases with increasing particle size. The third-order susceptibility of the ZnO nanoparticles is found to be in the order of 10(-10) esu, which is at least three order magnitude greater than the bulk ZnO. The optical limiting threshold of the nanoparticles varies in the range of 54 to 17 MW/cm(2). The results suggest that ZnO nanoparticles considered as a promising candidates for the future photonic devices.

AB Ca-4(PO4)(2)O:Eu2+ (CPO:Eu2+) phosphors were successfully synthesized by high-energy ball milling. In order to study the effect of sintering temperature, the phosphors were synthesized at various sintering temperatures. The crystal structure of CPO:Eu2+ was determined to be monoclinic P2(1). Owing to the f-d transitions of the Eu2+ ions in the CPO:Eu2+ phosphors, the PL spectra of the phosphors showed an intense red emission centered at 635 nm with 418 nm excitation. Using high-energy ball milling, a more intense emission (compared to that reported from other research) can be visually observed with human eyes in the form of orange-red light, which is helpful in latent fingerprint detection. In addition, high-temperature sintering results in an increase of the PL intensity owing to the larger particle size and lower levels of impurities in the CPO:Eu2+ phosphors.
   The latent fingerprint image obtained by using CPO:Eu2+ phosphors reveals a high contrast for various substrate materials, because the phosphors exhibit strong red emission and adhere to the residue of the fingerprint after flowing. On the basis of these results, red-emitting CPO:Eu2+ phosphors can be used for the detection of latent fingerprints in solving criminal cases.

AB The proximity of metal and semiconductor nanostructures leads to the emergence of new optical features for many tunable applications, which affects the electromagnetic modes in metallic nanostructure and electronic states in semiconductor nanostructure in nanometer scales. Thus, it will create some changes in the transition matrix elements and the absorption and emission properties. Therefore, absorption and emission properties can be designed and controlled by exciton-plasmon interaction. In the present study, Rhodamine-B and 6G were used as organic dyes in Polyvinylpyrrolidone as host medium and two-dimensional crystal as plasmonic ones. To this aim, Nano imprint lithography was used to produce two dimensional crystals and its deposit gold was utilized to harvest plasmonic mold in the proximity of excitonic media. Then, the dispersion relation was measured and the polar diagram was plotted for different coupling regime. Based on the results, this system has a poor capability for overcoming the difficulties of obtaining strong coupling although different figures of merit were observed for increasing coupling strength, which is very useful for designing and constructing new generation of plexitonic structures.

AB CsPbBr3 nanocrystals have attracted great interest owing to their high fluorescence quantum efficiency, adjustable photoluminescence wavelength, and good stability. We report a device that consists of disordered gold nanorods underneath a film of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals. Two-photon pumping using femtosecond laser pulses at 800 nm enables amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) at about 523 nm. In this work, a narrow peak with linewidth of 5 nm is observed when the pump fluence reaches a low threshold of 0.65 mJ/cm(2). The results show that plasmonic resonance of gold nanorods improves the emission transition rate and enables low threshold ASE.

AB An efficient and facile route for the solvent-induced synthesis of magnolia-like terbium-based metal-organic frameworks (Tb-MOFs) architectures has been developed at room temperature. The effect of ethanol volume ratio (R) on the microstructure and morphological evolution of the Tb-MOFs architectures has been systematically investigated. Interestingly, the blooming level of magnolia-like architectures increases with R values. A possible formation and evolution mechanism has been proposed. Moreover, the photoluminescence properties of the as-obtained Tb-MOFs architectures are discussed in detail. The result indicates that the emission intensity of the samples initially increased and then decreased with increasing R values. And, the samples synthesized at R = 0.3 with a blooming magnolia-like architectures have optimal luminescent properties and fluorescence lifetime owing to the fewer defect. Since its simplicity and low-cost, this developed synthetic route is promising for the controllable preparation of other functional micro/nano MOFs materials with improved properties.

AB Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped transparent phosphate glasses were successfully synthesized by conventional melt-quenching method. The upconversion (UC) emission spectra, fluorescence lifetime and transmission spectra were characterized by using UV-visible spectrophotometer and Fluorescence Spectrometer. The results show that the Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped phosphate glasses are highly transparent with a transmittance of about 90% in the visible light range, and the energy transfer between Yb3+ and Tm3+ occurs. Furthermore, the temperature dependent luminescence of the glasses was systematically investigated to explore the possible application as optical temperature sensors. Using the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) technique, the FIR of the UC emissions from 693 nm (Tm3+: (1)G(4) -> H-3(5)) and 658 nm (Tm3+: F-3(2) -> H-3(6)) was studied as a function of temperature in the range of 303-653 K, under 980 nm laser excitation. Impressively, the high relative temperature sensitivity of 3.94% K-1 was obtained at 303 K in the Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped phosphate glass, which is a very promising candidate for optical temperature sensors.

AB Herein, visible-light driven BiFeWO6/TiO2 nanocomposites photocatalysts were successfully synthesized by an incipient wet-impregnation method. The as-synthesized BiFeWO6/TiO2 nanocomposites were explored by using various techniques of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS), photoluminescence (PL), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) studies to investigate the material formation, surface morphology, electrochemical and optical behaviors. Furthermore, the photocatalytic efficiency of fabricated BiFeWO6/TiO2 nanocomposites was also evaluated towards the degradation of acid orange 7 (AO7). From the degradation results, it revealed that 1% BiFeWO6/TiO2 nanocomposite demonstrated superior photocatalytic performance than its comparison with pure components. This optimized 1% BiFeWO6/TiO2 nanocomposite was found to achieve complete degradation of AO7 within 60 min and also it showing a rate constant value of 0.054 min(-1) which is much superior to the pure TiO2. This improvement might be credited to its strong light absorption ability in a visible-light region and the low recombination rate of hole-electron pairs. Also, the BiFeWO6/TiO2 nanocomposite has an exceptional photostability and reusability character along with an excellent photo-electrochemical activity. Therefore, it can be well useful material for removing organic pollutants in the aqueous environment. Finally, a probable mechanism is suggested for the photodegradation of AO7 over as-synthesized BiFeWO6/TiO2 nanocomposite material.

AB Carbon dots are fascinating nanomaterials given their straightforward synthesis, unique optical properties, sensing capabilities, and biocompatibility. In this work, biocompatible carbon dots were prepared from yogurt using a two-step pyrolysis/hydrothermal method. The dots were spherical in shape with an average size of 4.7 nm. They showed blue emission under UV illumination with a quantum yield of 1.5%. Their photoluminescence was stable over three months and in both strong buffer solutions and highly concentrated salt solutions. The optical absorption and photoluminescence properties of the dots were employed for vapor and metal ion sensing, respectively. For the first time, the carbon dots were integrated into an optical electronic nose, and used for the detection of formic acid vapor at room temperature. Sensing was based on monitoring the optical transmission through a carbon dot film upon exposure to vapor, and the results were confirmed by UV-visible spectroscopy. The carbon dot-integrated electronic nose was able to distinguish vapor from formic acid/water solutions at different concentrations, with a detection limit of 7.3% v/v. The sensitivity of the dots to metal ions was tested by measuring the photoluminescence emission intensity at different excitation wavelengths. Principal component analysis was used to differentiate between the ions. The results suggested that interactions between carbon dots and metals ions occurred at a range of binding sites. The biocompability of the dots was demonstrated to be excellent. The study identified carbon dots produced from yogurt as multipurpose fluorescent nanomaterials with potential sensing and biomedical applications.

AB An ITO-Ag islands complex as a new transparent conducting electrode (TCE) structure (on the 5 nm-thick p-InGaN/90 nm-thick p-GaN) for achieving high-performance and more reliable GaN-based LEDs were fabricated. A normal LED with a conventional ITO TCE was also compared. The surface morphological, structural, electrical and optical properties of fabricated GaN-based light-emitting diodes using a complex electrode of submicron-scaled Ag islands and ITO thin films are explored by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), current-voltage (I-V) and output power-current (L-I) techniques. Surface morphology investigations revealed Ag islands formed uniformly on the p-InGaN/p-GaN surface during rapid thermal annealing at 400 degrees C for 1 min in N-2 ambient. The ohmic properties and overall device-performance of the suggested contact and device structures were superior to those in the conventional ITO contact and normal ITO LED structures. Based on the results of XRD and XPS measurements, the formation of the intermetallic gallide phases (AgGa) is responsible for better performance characteristics of the ITO-Ag islands device. The significant improvements are described in terms of the conducting bridge influence, highly effective micro-mirror effect, and wider photon window via the roughened structure.

AB To explore new upconversion (UC) phosphor materials for optical temperature sensing, a series of Er3+/Tm3+-Yb3+ doped Ca4Y6Si4O24 samples were designed by using solid-state reaction method. The phase purity was examined via XRD patterns, which indicates the obtained phosphors are single-phase. The UC spectra of CYS:1% Er3+,xYb(3+) (0 <= x <= 20%) reveal the green and red emission peaks of Er3+ show different change rate in intensity when the Yb3+ concentration increases, which can be owing to the cross-relaxation between Er3+ and Yb3+. For the Tm3+-Yb3+ doped CYS, the optimal Yb3+ concentration was determined to be 10 mol%. Different strategies were employed for temperature sensing behavior. The investigation indicates that the best sensor sensitivity was obtained in the CYS:1%Er3+,10%Yb3+ sample by employing the fluorescence intensity ratio technique with non-thermally coupled levels. The above results could be instructive to the development of new luminescent materials with high sensitivity.

TI Modeling and studying of white light emitting diodes based on CdS/ZnS

AB In this paper, we propose a quantum dot (QD) based white light emitting diode (WLED) structure to study theoretically the material gain and quantum efficiency of the system. We consider the spherical QDs with a II-VI semiconductor core (CdS) that covered with a wider band gap semiconductor acting as a shell (ZnS). In order to generate white light spectrum, we use layers with different dot size that can emit blue, green and red colors. The blue emission originating from CdS core combines to green/orange components originating from ZnS shell and creates an efficiency white light emission. To model this device, at first, we solve Schrodinger and Poisson equations self consistently and obtain eigen energies and wave functions. Then, we calculate the optical gain and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of a CdS/ZnS LED sample. We investigate the structural parameter effects on the optical properties of the WLED. The numerical results show that the gain profile and IQE curves depend strongly on the structural parameters such as dot size, carrier density and volume scaling parameter. The gain profile becomes higher and wider with increasing the core radius while it becomes less and narrower with increasing the shell thickness. Furthermore, it is found that the volume scaling parameter can manage the system quantum efficiency.

AB Despite the relevance of glass fibers and integrated optical circuits for an increasing number of cutting-edge applications ranging from telecommunication to sensing and quantum photonics, the knowledge about their structural and chemical properties is still in its infancy. Optical spectroscopy techniques are challenged due to the intrinsically low cross-sections for inelastic processes. Our approach is to detect these properties along the core, extending the interaction to the fiber length. We report on in-situ temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements in transmission geometry of a) pristine optical glass fibers (standard commercial telecom grade and different types of photosensitive fibers) and b) type I fiber Bragg grating (FBG) in hydrogen-loaded fibers of the same type. A laser with 473 nm wavelength and TEM 00 mode is coupled to an optical spectrometer through different fibers. The fibers are thermally cycled between room temperature and 950 degrees Celsius. As a first observation, we detect a clearly visible red emission from the uncoated fibers at the location of the fiber Bragg grating. Fitting the luminescence spectra with a single Gaussian and monitoring the intensity as a function of temperature reveals an irreversible, thermally activated degradation of the luminescence associated to the fiber Bragg gratings. A closer inspection of pristine glass fibers without FBG revealed a faint, yet thermally stable luminescence with similar spectral characteristics. Analyzing qualitative data for two consecutive heating cycles confirmed two distinct activation energies. This may be due to several reasons such as different defects at the basis of this emission or different structural or chemical environments for the same defect. Further experiment will be carried out in the future to investigate the main reason of two distinct activation energies.

AB Rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems are an effective low impact development practice that provides both water supply and runoff reduction benefits. A stochastic modelling approach is proposed in this paper to quantify the water supply reliability and stormwater capture efficiency of RWH systems. The input rainfall series is represented as a marked Poisson process and two typical water use patterns are analytically described. The stochastic mass balance equation is solved analytically, and based on this, explicit expressions relating system performance to system characteristics are derived. The performances of a wide variety of RWH systems located in five representative climatic regions of the United States are examined using the newly derived analytical equations. Close agreements between analytical and continuous simulation results are shown for all the compared cases. In addition, an analytical equation is obtained expressing the required storage size as a function of the desired water supply reliability, average water use rate, as well as rainfall and catchment characteristics. The equations developed herein constitute a convenient and effective tool for sizing RWH systems and evaluating their performances.

AB A geological repository for low and intermediate radioactive waste (bottom at -130 m a.s.l.) was constructed from 2008 to 2014 in the southeastern coastal area in Korea. This research aimed to evaluate the hydro geochemistry in this area during the construction period and to determine the characteristics that should be monitored during the operational period. During construction, the groundwater level decreased up to 136 m and the upper groundwater flow in the southeastern area reversed. After the groundwater level dropped below the sea level, the electrical conductivity (EC) in several wells along the coastal line started to increase; 23.2% of the measured water was classified as brackish water and the highest EC observed in groundwater was 18.9 mS/cm, nearly 38% of EC in seawater. The response time of the groundwater chemistry differs depending on the depth, even in wells, because of fracture networks. Among locations that showed drastic changes in EC, only the shallow depth of GM-4 showed a peak pattern in EC, but other locations showed increasing EC patterns or patterns with initial increase and sustained high till the end of the construction period. Based on the Cl/Br ratio, the source of the groundwater salinity was seawater intrusion, and ion exchange played an important role. Compared to Cl concentration, sodium was depleted and calcium was in excess in brackish water; however, the SO4/Cl ratio remained constant at a level similar to seawater. Ca and Fe concentrations showed distinguishable characteristics depending on the location, suggesting differences in geological media. During the operational period, periodical evaluation of the groundwater chemistry in the mixing zone and continuous monitoring of EC patterns and seawater fractions are required.

AB To simulate the impacts of within-storm rainfall variabilities on fast hydrological processes, long precipitation time series with high temporal resolution are required. Due to limited availability of observed data such time series are typically obtained from stochastic models. However, most existing rainfall models are limited in their ability to conserve rainfall event statistics which are relevant for hydrological processes. Poisson rectangular pulse models are widely applied to generate long time series of alternating precipitation events durations and mean intensities as well as interstorm period durations. Multiplicative microcanonical random cascade (MRC) models are used to disaggregate precipitation time series from coarse to fine temporal resolution.
   To overcome the inconsistencies between the temporal structure of the Poisson rectangular pulse model and the MRC model, we developed a new coupling approach by introducing two modifications to the MRC model. These modifications comprise (a) a modified cascade model ("constrained cascade") which preserves the event durations generated by the Poisson rectangular model by constraining the first and last interval of a precipitation event to contain precipitation and (b) continuous sigmoid functions of the multiplicative weights to consider the scale-dependency in the disaggregation of precipitation events of different durations.
   The constrained cascade model was evaluated in its ability to disaggregate observed precipitation events in comparison to existing MRC models. For that, we used a 20-year record of hourly precipitation at six stations across Germany. The constrained cascade model showed a pronounced better agreement with the observed data in terms of both the temporal pattern of the precipitation time series (e.g. the dry and wet spell durations and autocorrelations) and event characteristics (e.g. intra-event intermittency and intensity fluctuation within events). The constrained cascade model also slightly outperformed the other MRC models with respect to the intensity-frequency relationship.
   To assess the performance of the coupled Poisson rectangular pulse and constrained cascade model, precipitation events were stochastically generated by the Poisson rectangular pulse model and then disaggregated by the constrained cascade model. We found that the coupled model performs satisfactorily in terms of the temporal pattern of the precipitation time series, event characteristics and the intensity-frequency relationship.

AB Looking only at climate change impacts provides partial information about a changing hydrologic regime. Understanding the spatio-temporal nature of change in hydrologic processes, and the explicit contributions from both climate and land use drivers, holds more practical value for water resources management and policy intervention. This study presents a comprehensive assessment on the spatio-temporal trend of Blue Water (BW) and Green Water (GW) in a 490,000 km(2) temperate mid-latitude basin (Ohio River Basin) over the past 80 years (1935-2014), and from thereon, quantifies the combined as well as relative contributions of climate and land use changes. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is adopted to simulate hydrologic fluxes. Mann-Kendall and Theil-Sen statistical tests are performed on the modeled outputs to detect respectively the trend and magnitude of changes at three different spatial scales the entire basin, regional level, and sub-basin level. Despite the overall volumetric increase of both BW and GW in the entire basin, changes in their annual average values during the period of simulation reveal a distinctive spatial pattern. GW has increased significantly in the upper and lower parts of the basin, which can be related to the prominent land use change in those areas. BW has increased significantly only in the lower part, likely being associated with the notable precipitation change there. Furthermore, the simulation under a time-varying climate but constant land use scenario identifies climate change in the Ohio River Basin to be influential on BW, while the impact is relatively nominal on GW; whereas, land use change increases GW remarkably, but is counterproductive on BW. The approach to quantify combined/relative effects of climate and land use change as shown in this study can be replicated to understand BW-GW dynamics in similar large basins around the globe.

AB In this paper, a comprehensive and interdisciplinary framework for management of eutrophication in off-stream artificial lakes in semi-arid and arid regions is proposed. Identification of the lake's water resources system components and stakeholders, simulation of Phosphorus (P) export from upstream watershed, simulation of the lake water quality as well as simulation of water demands and supply, development of management scenarios for the lake and selecting the best scenario using social choice methods (i.e. discrete and fuzzy Borda counts) are the four main parts of the framework. The proposed framework is applied on Chitgar Artificial Lake (ChAL), the largest intra-urban artificial lake in Tehran which has been constructed in 2010-2013 for recreational purposes. The Load Apportionment Model (LAM) is used for the simulation of P loads from the point and non-point (diffusive) sources and the LakeMab model is used for the simulation of P dynamics in the lake. The management scenarios contain optimized rule curves for water intake/outtake blended with P management plans (i.e. removal of point sources of P load in the upstream watershed, construction of a hydroponic bio-filter or an advanced water treatment plant beside the lake for reduction of external loading of P and recycling lake water, alum treatment of lake sediments for controlling the internal loading of P as well as construction of a dry detention basin). The most preferred scenarios selected by the discrete Borda count are the low-cost alum treatment and dry detention basin, while the most preferred scenario according to fuzzy Borda count, which considers the uncertainty of model inputs, is the costly water treatment plant. In all preferred scenarios, water intake is conducted from flood flows in order to avoid conflict with downstream agricultural demands. In addition to decentralized decision making and stakeholders' participation, the proposed framework promotes the integration of the technical aspects such as the role of internal loading in lake eutrophication and separation of flood and non-flood flows in the off-stream lakes' systems.

AB The present paper proposes a smoothing analysis of hydraulic head data sets obtained by means of different slug tests introduced in a confined aquifer. Laboratory experiments were performed through a 3D large-scale physical model built at the University of Calabria. The hydraulic head data were obtained by a pressure transducer placed in the injection well and subjected to a processing operation to smooth out the high-frequency noise occurring in the recorded signals. The adopted smoothing techniques working in time, frequency and time-frequency domain are the Savitzky-Golay filter modeled by third-order polynomial, the Fourier Transform and two types of Wavelet Transform (Mexican hat and Monet). The performances of the filtered time series of the hydraulic heads for different slug volumes and measurement frequencies were statistically analyzed in terms of optimal fitting of the classical Cooper's equation. For practical purposes, the hydraulic heads smoothed by the involved techniques were used to determine the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer. The energy contents and the frequency oscillations of the hydraulic head variations in the aquifer were exploited in the time-frequency domain by means of Wavelet Transform as well as the non-linear features of the observed hydraulic head oscillations around the theoretical Cooper's equation.

AB Real-time flood forecasting is important for decision-making with regards to flood control and disaster reduction. The conventional approach involves a postprocessor calibration strategy that first calibrates the hydrological model and then estimates errors. This procedure can simulate streamflow consistent with observations, but obtained parameters are not optimal. Joint calibration strategies address this issue by refining hydrological model parameters jointly with the autoregressive (AR) model. In this study, five alternative schemes are used to forecast floods. Scheme I uses only the hydrological model, while scheme II includes an AR model for error correction. In scheme III, differencing is used to remove non-stationarity in the error series. A joint inference strategy employed in scheme IV calibrates the hydrological and AR models simultaneously. The back-fitting algorithm, a basic approach for training an additive model, is adopted in scheme V to alternately recalibrate hydrological and AR model parameters. The performance of the five schemes is compared with a case study of 15 recorded flood events from China's Baiyunshan reservoir basin. Our results show that (1) schemes IV and V outperform scheme III during the calibration and validation periods and (2) scheme V is inferior to scheme IV in the calibration period, but provides better results in the validation period. Joint calibration strategies can therefore improve the accuracy of flood forecasting. Additionally, the back-fitting recalibration strategy produces weaker overcorrection and a more robust performance compared with the joint inference strategy.

ID UNCERTAINTY; RIVER
AB River monitoring is a critical issue for hydrological modelling that relies strongly on the use of flow rating curves (FRCs). In most cases, these functions are derived by least-squares fitting which usually leads to good performance indices, even when based on a limited range of data that especially lack high flow observations. In this context, cross-section geometry is a controlling factor which is not fully exploited in classical approaches. In fact, river discharge is obtained as the product of two factors: 1) the area of the wetted cross-section and 2) the cross sectionally averaged velocity. Both factors can be expressed as a function of the river stage, defining a viable alternative in the derivation of FRCs. This makes it possible to exploit information about cross-section geometry limiting, at least partially, the uncertainty in the extrapolation of discharge at higher flow values. Numerical analyses and field data confirm the reliability of the proposed procedure for the derivation of FRCs.

AB Evaporation plays a major role in lake systems, as it affects the water, energy and solutes budgets. Water salinity reduces evaporation, and as a result affects the energy budget of the lake, including stored heat. In this study, we explore the seasonal and diurnal variations of evaporation and other energy fluxes over the Dead Sea, the deepest and saltiest hypersaline lake on Earth. We present two consecutive years observations using Eddy Covariance system, meteorological stations and a buoy station measuring the water column properties. These observations reveal the effects of synoptic and mesoscale atmospheric circulation on lake evaporation. The seasonal cycle of evaporation is characterized by two peaks. The summer evaporation peak is related to high radiation inputs. The winter peak stem from the high heat storage of the deep lake, with evaporation driven by high vapor pressure demand, combined with synoptic scale wind systems and thermal instability. In summer, the synoptic circulation is stable, providing a weak background wind velocity (Persian trough), hence, the dominant diurnal wind pattern is induced by the Mediterranean Sea Breeze (mesoscale circulation). The two years of eddy covariance measurements in the hypersaline Dead Sea, located in a hyperarid region, revealed annual evaporation rate of 1.13 +/- 0.13 m yr(-1). We explored several evaporation models versus the directly measured evaporation, and found that the most reliable is a mass transfer model, that was calibrated here for the Dead Sea.

AB For a highly developed urban area with complete drainage systems, flood simulation is necessary for describing the flow dynamics from rainfall, to surface runoff, and to sewer flow. In this study, a coupled flood model based on diffusion wave equations was proposed to simulate one-dimensional sewer flow and two-dimensional overland flow simultaneously. The overland flow model provides details on the rainfall-runoff process to estimate the excess runoff that enters the sewer system through street inlets for sewer flow routing. Three types of inlet modelling are considered in this study, including the manhole-based approach that ignores the street inlets by draining surface water directly into manholes, the inlet-manhole approach that drains surface water into manholes that are each connected to multiple inlets, and the inlet-node approach that drains surface water into sewer nodes that are connected to individual inlets. The simulation results were compared with a high-intensity rainstorm event that occurred in 2015 in Taipei City. In the verification of the maximum flood extent, the two approaches that considered street inlets performed considerably better than that without street inlets. When considering the aforementioned models in terms of temporal flood variation, using manholes as receivers leads to an overall inefficient draining of the surface water either by the manhole-based approach or by the inlet manhole approach. Using the inlet-node approach is more reasonable than using the inlet-manhole approach because the inlet-node approach greatly reduces the fluctuation of the sewer water level. The inlet-node approach is more efficient in draining surface water by reducing flood volume by 13% compared with the inlet manhole approach and by 41% compared with the manhole-based approach. The results show that inlet modeling has a strong influence on drainage efficiency in coupled flood simulation.

AB Selection of suitable urban stormwater harvesting sites and associated project planning are often complex due to spatial, temporal, economic, environmental and social factors, and related various other variables. This paper is aimed at developing a comprehensive methodology framework for evaluating of stormwater harvesting sites in urban areas using Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). At the first phase, framework selects potential stormwater harvesting (SWH) sites using spatial characteristics in a GIS environment. In second phase, MCDA methodology is used for evaluating and ranking of SWH sites in multi-objective and multi-stakeholder environment.
   The paper briefly describes first phase of framework and focuses chiefly on the second phase of framework. The application of the methodology is also demonstrated over a case study comprising of the local government area, City of Melbourne (CoM), Australia for the benefit of wider water professionals engaged in this area. Nine performance measures (PMs) were identified to characterise the objectives and system performance related to the eight alternative SWH sites for the demonstration of the application of developed methodology. To reflect the stakeholder interests in the current study, four stakeholder participant groups were identified, namely, water authorities (WA), academics (AC), consultants (CS), and councils (CL).
   The decision analysis methodology broadly consisted of deriving PROMETHEE II rankings of eight alternative SWH sites in the CoM case study, under two distinct group decision making scenarios. The major innovation of this work is the development and application of comprehensive methodology framework that assists in the selection of potential sites for SWH, and facilitates the ranking in multi-objective and multi-stakeholder environment. It is expected that the proposed methodology will assist the water professionals and managers with better knowledge that will reduce the subjectivity in the selection and evaluation of SWH sites.

AB The estimation of evaporative fluxes and their effects on soil suction is assuming a prominent role in the field of interpretation and early-warning prediction of rainfall-induced landslides. Evaporation models refer essentially to sands or plastic (silty and clayey) soils. Models validated specifically for non-plastic silty pyroclastic soils, usually characterized by very high porosity, are instead unavailable. This deficit arises although silty pyroclastic covers are widely spread across the world, increasingly involved in rainfall-induced landslides and recognized showing particular hydrological behaviour. A number of questions may be raised about the issue: (i) may any evaporative models be reliably extended to silty pyroclastic soils?; (ii) what atmospheric variables need to be monitored at least to reliably predict evaporation fluxes in these soils?; and (iii) how accurate evaporation estimations are if they are referred to silty pyroclastic covers for early warning purposes? This study addresses these questions by assessing the capabilities of several simplified models in estimating evaporative (potential and actual) fluxes for silty pyroclastic soils. To this aim, a large-scale lysimeter, consisting in a silty pyroclastic layer exposed to the atmosphere and comprehensively monitored for both weather forcing and hydrological soil variables, is adopted. It provides a dataset of observations suitable to calibrate and validate the selected evaporation models. Moreover, the availability of weather observations makes it possible to define the minimum set of equipment required to attain reliable evaporation estimation. This study shows that: (i) the adoption of a literature-based calibration can produce misleading estimates of actual evaporation, whereas the model performances after a lysimeter-based recalibration are satisfactory; (ii) reducing the weather measurements can induce an overestimation of predicted fluxes up to 50%; and (iii) the investigated models quite accurately predict water out-coming fluxes while running in early warning predictions.

AB Variability in micrometeorological conditions and their influence on estimated reference evapotranspiration (RET) rates were evaluated across a heterogeneous urban environment. Micrometeorological data sets (incoming solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed) were collected over a one-year period at six weather stations in New York City, NY (USA). Weather stations are located at four new urban green space monitoring sites and two airports. Reference evapotranspiration (RET) rates were estimated from the micro meteorological data sets for a short reference surface at a daily time-step using the ASCE Standardized Reference Evapotranspiration Equation, a Penman-Monteith based combination equation. Non-parametric comparative statistical analyses (Kruskal-Wallis) revealed statistically significant differences (at significance level alpha = 0.05) in micrometeorological conditions and estimated RET rates between the six sites. On a cumulative annual basis, estimated RET varied by up to 40 percent between the sites. A new technique for adjusting weather data collected at one location (e.g. regional airports) for use at another location (e.g. interior engineered urban green spaces) was evaluated. The study highlights the importance, for accurate estimation of ET, of onsite micro meteorological data sets, but concludes that additional research is needed to more thoroughly characterize micrometeorological variability across heterogeneous urban environments, and also to evaluate the influence of non-meteorological determinants, e.g. vegetation type, soil/media type, media moisture conditions and anthropogenic heat fluxes, on urban ET.

AB Two dimensional flood inundation models capable of simulating complex spatially and temporally differentiated floodplain flows are routinely used to model and predict flooding. However, advances in modelling techniques have not been matched by improvements in model validation. Validation of flood models remains challenging due to a lack of available spatially-explicit data; traditionally measured data and validation approaches reveal little about the ability of a model to simulate the complex dynamics of floodplain flows, including the pathways, timeline, and impacts of an event. In this paper we propose a novel method for the validation of hydraulic models of flooding using quantitative and qualitative Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). This method uses VGI data to enhance traditionally measured validation data by reconstructing the observed dynamics of a flood, allowing validation of the temporal and spatial simulation of these dynamics. We illustrate the method using a case study from Corbridge in the northeast of England, using VGI collected through participatory research with people affected by severe flooding in 2015. The results of the study demonstrate that VGI data can be used for the effective reconstruction of flood event dynamics. The results also reveal that the proposed validation approach is able to identify underperformance in the model's simulation of event dynamics not evaluated by standard global performance measures. Such a lack of evaluation can have adverse consequences where dynamic model outputs are used locally to influence floodplain management. As a result, we propose a new framework for model validation, adopting a pragmatic and flexible approach to examining event dynamics using a diverse range of data.

AB Thermal infrared (TIR) imaging has been previously applied to survey relatively large thermal footprints in coastal zones, lakes, reservoirs and rivers. In freshwater systems, the buoyancy of relatively warm groundwater during the winter months allows for the surface identification of groundwater discharge or thermal pollution using TIR imaging. However, information regarding the performance of TIR for resolving this warm groundwater upwelling is limited, particularly at fine spatial scales and variable discharge rates. In order to evaluate the suitability of TIR to trace warm groundwater upwelling at the water surface of lakes, ponds and reservoirs (e.g. lacustrine groundwater discharge (LGD) in shallow near-shore zones) we conducted a mesocosm experiment with a TIR camera situated 4 m above the water surface to capture thermal patterns in response to different groundwater discharge rates, weather conditions and the diurnal cycle. A fiber optic distributed temperature sensing system (FO-DTS) installed at 2 cm below the water surface was used to ground-truth spatial patterns observed in TIR images. Results show the impacts of both the diurnal cycle of net radiation and prevailing weather conditions on the accuracy of TIR imaging for resolving warm groundwater discharge. Most reliable results were obtained under overcast weather conditions and during the night. The results of our study provide guidance for those looking to use TIR for conducting thermal tracing of LGD at the surface of freshwater bodies during winter.

AB A new simple and robust solution, based on uniform steady-state flow velocity, is developed for the problem of solute transport in a fracture-matrix system with a finite penetration depth of a radioactive contaminant into the rock matrix. The solution is an extension of Liu et al. (2017) to finite penetration depth and an alternative solution strategy to the problem solved by Sudicky et al. (1982). The solution takes the form of a convolution of two functions. The first function describes the probability density function of the residence time distribution of a conservative solute resulting merely from advection and Fickian dispersion. The second function is actually the impulse response of the fracture-matrix system in the case of a plug flow without any hydrodynamic dispersion. As a result, the effects of Fickian dispersion and matrix diffusion on solute transport are decoupled, and thus the resulting breakthrough curve can be analyzed in terms of those two functions. In addition to this, the derived Peclet numbers of those two functions, based on temporal moments, are also found to be associated with the derived Peclet number of the resulting breakthrough curve. By comparing the Peclet numbers of those two functions, the contribution of Fickian dispersion and matrix diffusion to solute spreading is determined in a straightforward way. This can aid to find out the dominating mechanism on solute transport, and therefore the performance of breakthrough curve can be approximated by only one function in some specific cases.

AB Anthropogenic warming may change precipitation patterns, impacting infrastructure performance and reliability. Future precipitation statistics generated using General Circulation Models (GCM) are, however, often biased and not easily applied to problems such as runoff estimation. Stochastic weather generation is hence used as an alternative to GCMs in hydrology and hydraulic modelling. This paper explores the dependence of fine temporal precipitation characteristics on air pressure and air temperature using historic observations. The goal is to develop, based on the key causes of precipitation, a climatological basis for a stochastic precipitation generator for non-stationary precipitation under climate change conditions. The analysis focuses on precipitation in the urban Northeast United States and utilizes pooled observations from meteorological stations in New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston over 60 years. A negative correlation between hourly Probability of Precipitation (POP) and air pressure is observed. When the historical records are discretized using air Pressure Change Events (PCE), Decreasing Pressure Change Events (DePCEs) had a higher POP and a higher Precipitation Depth (PD) than Increasing Pressure Change Events (InPCEs). Temperature was more strongly associated with PD during DePCEs than InPCEs; this association was more pronounced during high magnitude PCEs and extreme events. The potential for simulating future hourly precipitation by associating historic hourly precipitation patterns with PCE's and monthly temperature is assessed.

AB The implementation of source water protection programs is relatively recent in Canada and the United States. Although protecting water at the watershed scale has been a focus of many of these programs, few Indigenous communities located within these watersheds are involved in the process. The purpose of this scoping review was to examine and map the extent, range, and nature of the published peer-reviewed literature on the adoption, implementation, and outcomes of source water protection programs involving Indigenous populations in Canada and the United States. This review followed a systematic process to identify and evaluate the literature. Searches were conducted in three aggregator databases (Web of Science (TM), ProQuest (R), and GreenFILE (TM)). Two independent reviewers conducted a systematic two-stage screening process using inclusion and exclusion criteria in the software DistillerSR(C). Articles that met inclusion criteria were analyzed using thematic qualitative and descriptive quantitative methods. The findings indicate that: a) there is a lack of peer-reviewed studies focusing on the ecological outcomes of source water protection programs that are inclusive of Indigenous populations in Canada and the United States; b) the depth to which the literature describes Indigenous involvement in source water protection programs is minimal; and c) Indigenous involvement in source water protection programs is generally not reported as substantial. This review provides several recommendations to improve both the peer reviewed literature on the topic and source water protection programs. There is a need to improve reporting in the literature on quantitative program results, the nature of Indigenous involvement in source water protection programs, and Indigenous-inclusive inter-jurisdictional success stories. It is also recommended that source water protection programs recognize Indigenous peoples as more than stakeholders groups, and that future studies pull from innovations in other fields to address complex problems and provide new insights to the field of source water protection. The methodology presented in this paper provides a template for researchers in engineering and environmental fields, such as hydrology, to identify and review published literature in a systematic, transparent, and rigorous manner.

TI Modelling of metaldehyde concentrations in surface waters: A travel time

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID RAINFALL-RUNOFF RESPONSE; PESTICIDE CONCENTRATIONS; DIFFUSE POLLUTION;
   COEFFICIENTS; GERMANY; LOSSES
AB Diffuse agricultural pollution is widely recognized as a significant threat to the quality of water resources. Metaldehyde is a soluble synthetic aldehyde pesticide used globally in agriculture which has caused recent concern due to high observed levels (exceeding the European and UK standards for pesticides in drinking water value of 0.1 mu g/1) in surface waters utilized for potable water supply. This paper describes the development of a new travel time based physically distributed metaldehyde prediction model which aims to describe the short term fluctuations of metaldehyde concentrations in surface waters caused by rainfall runoff events. This will enable water infrastructure operators to consider informed control decisions in order to improve the quality of abstracted surface water. The methodology is developed and trailed within a case study catchment in the UK. The new approach integrates spatially and temporally disaggregated surface runoff generation, routing and build-up/wash-off concepts using a simple structure in a GIS environment to build a metaldehyde concentration prediction model. The use of 1 km(2) resolution radar rainfall data and identification of high risk areas in the catchment provide an approach which considers the spatio-temporal variations of pollutant generation and transport in the catchment. The model is calibrated and validated using available catchment flow and a new metaldehyde concentration dataset acquired using automatic samplers over four rainfall events. An average coefficient of determination and model efficiency of 0.75 and 0.46 respectively have been obtained for the rainfall events used to validate the model. This shows the capability of the model for the intended purpose of predicting the arrival of peak metaldehyde concentrations at surface water abstraction sites and informing abstraction decisions.

AB Lake Tisso is the fourth largest lake in Denmark with sufficient, continuous surface water input making lake bank filtration an optimal surface water extraction method provided that there are suitable shallow aquifers with a good hydraulic connection to the lake. The shallow subsurface under the lake was mapped by five waterborne Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) and eight Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) surveys to locate potentially suitable aquifers. Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) was used for the general characterisation of the hydraulic connection between the lake and aquifer. The waterborne ERT surveys showed several zones of coarser material along the shore extending up to five meters depth below the lake surface, while on-land ERT surveys confirmed that these zones extend to the lakeshore with similar thickness. Both waterborne ERT and GPR profiles agreed that at a selected field site the highest possibility of coarse sediments is 60-140 m from the lakeshore. Lakebed temperatures measured in December 2016, May and June 2017 all indicated potential groundwater discharge to the lake at approximately 135 m from the shoreline supporting the results of geophysical surveys showing coarser sediments in that area. A 2D numerical flow model of the area with a geological setup based on geophysical information and slugtest data, also showed upward groundwater discharge peaks at 60 and 140 m from the shoreline confirming the findings of the field surveys. Thus, this study shows that the combination of waterborne ERT and GPR surveys with DTS measurements is a fast and efficient way to assess the feasibility of lake bank filtration in these settings. This approach of combined hydrogeophysical methods is robust and has a potential to site lake bank filtration areas not only next to large rivers where coarse sediments are found in abundance, but even in different sedimentary environments where suitable layers for lake bank filtration are more difficult to identify.

TI Meteoric water lines in arid Central Asia using event-based and monthly

AB The local meteoric water line (LMWL) reflects the relationship between stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation, and is usually calculated using an ordinary least squares regression (OLSR). When event-based data are used to calculate a LMWL, the differences in precipitation amount of samples are not considered using OLSR, which in turn may influence the representativeness of the LMWL for local hydrology. Small rain events occur widely in arid Central Asia (annual mean precipitation < 150 mm), and where smaller precipitation has lower deuterium excess, this results in LMWLs with slopes and intercepts lower than the global average. Based on an observation network of isotopes in precipitation across the Tianshan Mountains in arid Central Asia, LMWLs for 23 stations are calculated from event-based data from 2012 to 2013 (n = 978), using ordinary least squares, reduced major axis and major axis regressions and their precipitation-weighted counterparts. For the northern slope and mountainous areas, the LMWL slope and intercept are close to the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL), but the slope and intercept are lower for the southern slope indicating the greater dominance of sub-cloud evaporation. The effect of moisture recycling in the irrigated areas on the northern slope also can be seen where the LMWL slopes are > 8. Using a precipitation weighted regression method with event-based data (especially precipitation-weighted reduced major axis regression, PWRMA) is generally consistent with the OLSR regression using monthly data. However, event-based datasets provide a wider range of values to better constrain the regression than can be achieved using monthly data over a short period, providing a sounder basis for determining LMWLs for relatively short-term sampling campaigns in an arid setting. The use of the PWRMA regression is preferred for determining the LMWL for the Tianshan Mountains, and results in a regional meteoric water line of delta D = 7.9 delta O-l8 + 10.16.

AB Hydro-diplomacy conversations have up till now been generally state- and basin-centric, focused on formal international relations and transboundary rivers. This paper applies the notion of water diplomacy to a project in rural Southwest Morocco in order to interrogate the scalar potential of water-based environmental peace-building.
   In the Ait Baamrane region of the Anti-Atlas Mountains, a local non-profit oversees the world's largest operational fog-harvesting system, piping potable water collected from the mountains' extensive fog cover to 13 Amazigh villages. Dar Si Hmad's related Ethnographic Field School leverages the fog project's uniqueness to attract scholars to an underrepresented region, where research programming questions mainstream narratives of Morocco and sustainable development while exploring how traditional knowledges can be integrated in scientific innovation.
   This paper argues that, by intentionally using fog to facilitate collaborative exchange, Dar Si Hmad is engaging in a form of hydro-diplomacy. Drawing from ethnographic data and building on international relations theories of Track Diplomacy, this paper demonstrates how fog water is being used to lay the groundwork for durable peace, intercultural understanding, and symbiotic growth. Such local iterations of hydro-diplomacy should be better understood and integrated with the emerging literature on state-to-state water cooperation in order to develop holistic expertise, share best practices, and promote positive policy interventions.

AB In this study, a new approach is developed to simulate groundwater flow through both an overlying unconfined aquifer and an underlying discrete fracture network. The groundwater exchange between the aquifer and the fracture network, including magnitude and direction, is explicitly simulated based on the mass conservation, which depends on a variety of parameters related to flow and network characteristics. In the overlying unconfined aquifer, we approximate the flow using the Dupuit assumptions. In the underlying fracture network, we use the cubic law and Forchheimer's law to iteratively simulate laminar or turbulent flow in individual fractures depending on the Reynolds number. Explicitly separating laminar and turbulent flows in the fractures results in a system of nonlinear equations, which is iteratively solved. While the flow from the overlying unconfined aquifer is a small portion of the overall flow in the underlying fracture network, incorrect use of the laminar or turbulent flow equation in the fractures can lead to significant errors in simulating the flow exchange. As apertures increase, both the portion of the total flowrate in the aquifer and the portion of the flow in the fractures coming from the aquifer decrease. As the overall hydraulic gradient increases, both the portion of the total flow in the aquifer and the portion of the fracture flow that comes from the aquifer increase. The portion of the total flow in the aquifer increases with the aquifer thickness, while the portion of fracture flow coming from the overlying aquifer decreases.

AB The hydro-geological properties of streambed together with the hydraulic gradients determine the fluxes of water, energy and solutes between the stream and underlying aquifer system. Dam induced sedimentation affects hyporheic processes and alters substrate pore space geometries in the course of progressive stabilization of the sediment layers. Uncertainty in stream-aquifer interactions arises from the inherent complex-nested flow paths and spatio-temporal variability of streambed hydraulic properties. A detailed field investigation of streambed hydraulic conductivity (K-s) using Guelph Permeameter was carried out in an intermittent stream reach of the Pavanje river basin located in the mountainous, forested tract of western ghats of India. The present study reports the spatial and temporal variability of streambed hydraulic conductivity along the stream reach obstructed by two Vented Dams in sequence. Statistical tests such as Levene's and Welch's t-tests were employed to check for various variability measures. The strength of spatial dependence and the presence of spatial auto-correlation among the streambed K-s samples were tested by using Moran's I statistic. The measures of central tendency and dispersion pointed out reasonable spatial variability in K-s distribution throughout the study reach during two consecutive years 2016 and 2017. The streambed was heterogeneous with regard to hydraulic conductivity distribution with high-K-s zones near the backwater areas of the vented dam and low-K-s zones particularly at the tail water section of vented dams. Dam operational strategies were responsible for seasonal fluctuations in sedimentation and modifications to streambed substrate characteristics (such as porosity, grain size, packing etc.), resulting in heterogeneous streambed K-s profiles. The channel downstream of vented dams contained significantly more cohesive deposits of fine sediment due to the overflow of surplus suspended sediment-laden water at low velocity and pressure head. The statistical test results accept the hypothesis of significant spatial variability of streambed K-s but refuse to accept the temporal variations. The deterministic and geo-statistical approaches of spatial interpolation provided virtuous surface maps of streambed K-s distribution.

AB Extreme flows are key components of river flow regimes that affect manifold hydrological, geomorphological and ecological processes with societal relevance. One fundamental characteristic of extreme flows in river basins is that they exhibit scaling properties which can be identified through scaling (power) laws. Understanding the physical mechanisms behind such scaling laws is a continuing challenge in hydrology, with potential implications for the prediction of river flow regimes in a changing environment and ungauged basins. After highlighting that the scaling properties are sensitive to environmental change, we develop a physical interpretation of how temporal changes in scaling exponents relate to the capacity of river basins to regulate extreme river flows. Regulation is defined here as the basins' capacity to either dampen high flows or to enhance low flows. Further, we use this framework to infer temporal changes in the regulation capacity of five large basins in tropical South America. Our results indicate that, during the last few decades, the Amazon river basin has been reducing its capacity to enhance low flows, likely as a consequence of pronounced environmental change in its south and south-eastern sub-basins. The proposed framework is widely applicable to different basins, and provides foundations for using scaling laws as empirical tools for inferring temporal changes of hydrological regulation, particularly relevant for identifying and managing hydrological consequences of environmental change.

AB Reference evapotranspiration (ET0) plays a fundamental role in agronomic, forestry, and water resources management. Estimating and forecasting ET0 have long been recognized as a major challenge for researchers and practitioners in these communities. This work explored the potential of multiple leading numerical weather predictions (NWPs) for estimating and forecasting summer ET0 at 101 U.S. Regional Climate Reference Network stations over nine climate regions across the contiguous United States (CONUS). Three leading global NWP model forecasts from THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) dataset were used in this study, including the single model ensemble forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (EC), the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Forecast System (NCEP), and the United Kingdom Meteorological Office forecasts (MO), as well as multi-model ensemble forecasts from the combinations of these NWP models. A regression calibration was employed to bias correct the ET0 forecasts. Impact of individual forecast variables on ET0 forecasts were also evaluated. The results showed that the EC forecasts provided the least error and highest skill and reliability, followed by the MO and NCEP forecasts. The multi-model ensembles constructed from the combination of EC and MO forecasts provided slightly better performance than the single model EC forecasts. The regression process greatly improved ET0 forecast performances, particularly for the regions involving stations near the coast, or with a complex orography. The performance of EC forecasts was only slightly influenced by the size of the ensemble members, particularly at short lead times. Even with less ensemble members, EC still performed better than the other two NWPs. Errors in the radiation forecasts, followed by those in the wind, had the most detrimental effects on the ET0 forecast performances.

AB Extreme precipitation can cause flooding and may result in great economic losses and deaths. The return level is a commonly used measure of extreme precipitation events and is required for hydrological engineer designs, including those of sewerage systems, dams, reservoirs and bridges. In this paper, we propose a two-step method to estimate the return level and its uncertainty for a study region. In the first step, we use the generalized extreme value distribution, the L-moment method and the stationary bootstrap to estimate the return level and its uncertainty at the site with observations. In the second step, a spatial model incorporating the heterogeneous measurement errors and covariates is trained to estimate return levels at sites with no observations and to improve the estimates at sites with limited information. The proposed method is applied to the daily rainfall data from 273 weather stations in the Haihe river basin of North China. We compare the proposed method with two alternatives: the first one is based on the ordinary Kriging method without measurement error, and the second one smooths the estimated location and scale parameters of the generalized extreme value distribution by the universal Kriging method. Results show that the proposed method outperforms its counterparts. We also propose a novel approach to assess the two-step method by comparing it with the at-site estimation method with a series of reduced length of observations. Estimates of the 2-, 5-, 10-, 20-, 50- and 100-year return level maps and the corresponding uncertainties are provided for the Haihe river basin, and a comparison with those released by the Hydrology Bureau of Ministry of Water Resources of China is made.

AB Green infrastructure such as Low Impact Development (LID) controls are being employed to manage the urban stormwater and restore the predevelopment hydrological conditions besides improving the stormwater runoff water quality. Since runoff generation and infiltration processes are nonlinear, there is a need for identifying optimal combination of LID controls. A coupled optimization-simulation model was developed by linking the U.S. EPA Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) to the Borg Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm (Borg MOEA). The coupled model is capable of performing multiobjective optimization which uses SWMM simulations as a tool to evaluate potential solutions to the optimization problem. The optimization-simulation tool was used to evaluate low impact development (LID) stormwater controls. A SWMM model was developed, calibrated, and validated for a sewershed in Windsor, Ontario and LID stormwater controls were tested for three different return periods. LID implementation strategies were optimized using the optimization-simulation model for five different implementation scenarios for each of the three storm events with the objectives of minimizing peak flow in the stormsewers, reducing total runoff, and minimizing cost. For the sewershed in Windsor, Ontario, the peak run off and total volume of the runoff were found to reduce by 13% and 29%, respectively.

TI Using complexity science and negotiation theory to resolve

ID IRRIGATION; POLICY
AB Many water governance and management issues are complex. The complexity of these issues is related to crossing of multiple boundaries: political, social and jurisdictional, as well as physical, ecological and biogeochemical. Resolution of these issues usually requires interactions of many parties with conflicting values and interests operating across multiple boundaries and scales to make decisions. The interdependence and feedback among interacting variables, processes, actors and institutions are hard to model and difficult to forecast. Thus, decision-making related to complex water problems needs be contingent and adaptive. This paper draws on a number of ideas from complexity science and negotiation theory that may make it easier to cope with the complexities and difficulties of managing boundary crossing water disputes. It begins with the Water Diplomacy Framework that was developed and tested over the past several years. Then, it uses three key ideas from complexity science (interdependence and interconnectedness; uncertainty and feedback; emergence and adaptation) and three from negotiation theory (stakeholder identification and engagement; joint fact finding; and value creation through option generation) to show how application of these ideas can help enhance effectiveness of water management.

AB Quantitative analysis of recession curves of karst spring hydrographs is a vital tool for understanding karst hydrology and inferring hydraulic properties of karst aquifers. This paper presents a new model for simulating karst spring recession curves. The new model has the following characteristics: (1) the model considers two separate but hydraulically connected reservoirs: matrix reservoir and conduit reservoir; (2) the model separates karst spring hydrograph recession into three stages: conduit-drainage stage, mixed-drainage stage (with both conduit drainage and matrix drainage), and matrix-drainage stage; and (3) in the mixed-drainage stage, the model uses multiple conduit layers to present different levels of conduit development. The new model outperforms the classical Mangin model and the recently developed Fiorillo model for simulating observed discharge at the Madison Blue Spring located in northern Florida. This is attributed to the latter two characteristics of the new model. Based on the new model, a method is developed for estimating effective porosity of the matrix and conduit reservoirs for the three drainage stages. The estimated porosity values are consistent with measured matrix porosity at the study site and with estimated conduit porosity reported in literature. The new model for simulating karst spring hydrograph recession is mathematically general, and can be applied to a wide range of karst spring hydrographs to understand groundwater flow in karst aquifers. The limitations of the model are discussed at the end of this paper.

AB This paper examines the frequency, distribution tails, and peak-over-threshold (POT) of extreme floods through analysis that centers on the October 2015 flooding in North Carolina (NC) and South Carolina (SC), United States (US). The most striking features of the October 2015 flooding were a short time to peak (T-p) and a multi-hour continuous flood peak which caused intensive and widespread damages to human lives, properties, and infrastructure. The 2015 flooding was produced by a sequence of intense rainfall events which originated from category 4 hurricane Joaquin over a period of four days. Here, the probability distribution and distribution parameters (i.e., location, scale, and shape) of floods were investigated by comparing the upper part of empirical distributions of the annual maximum flood (AMF) and POT with light- to heavy- theoretical tails: Frechet, Pareto, Gumbel, Weibull, Beta, and Exponential. Specifically, four sets of U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gauging data from the central Carolinas with record lengths from approximately 65-125 years were used. Analysis suggests that heavier-tailed distributions are in better agreement with the POT and somewhat AMF data than more often used exponential (light) tailed probability distributions. Further, the threshold selection and record length affect the heaviness of the tail and fluctuations of the parent distributions. The shape parameter and its evolution in the period of record play a critical and poorly understood role in determining the scaling of flood response to intense rainfall.

AB Geostatistical analysis has been introduced over half a century ago to allow quantifying seemingly random spatial variations in earth quantities such as rock mineral content or permeability. The traditional approach has been to view such quantities as multivariate Gaussian random functions characterized by one or a few well-defined spatial correlation scales. There is, however, mounting evidence that many spatially varying quantities exhibit non-Gaussian behavior over a multiplicity of scales. The purpose of this minireview is not to paint a broad picture of the subject and its treatment in the literature. Instead, we focus on very recent advances in the recognition and analysis of this ubiquitous phenomenon, which transcends hydrology and the Earth sciences, brought about largely by our own work. In particular, we use porosity data from a deep borehole to illustrate typical aspects of such scalable non-Gaussian behavior, describe a very recent theoretical model that (for the first time) captures all these behavioral aspects in a comprehensive manner, show how this allows generating random realizations of the quantity conditional on sampled values, point toward ways of incorporating scalable non Gaussian behavior in hydrologic analysis, highlight the significance of doing so, and list open questions requiring further research.

AB Clean water is crucial for sustainable economic and social development; however, around the world low water use efficiency and increasing water pollution have become serious problems. To comprehensively evaluate water use and wastewater treatment, this paper integrated bi-level programming (BLP) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) with a feedback variable to deal with poor output to rank DMUs using a super efficiency DEA. The proposed model was applied to a case study of 10 cities in the Minjiang River Basin to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness, from which it was found that a water system can only be cost-efficient when both the water use and wastewater treatment subsystems are both cost-efficient. The comparison analysis demonstrated that the proposed model was more discriminating, and stable than traditional DEA models and was able to better improve total water system cost efficiencies than a BLP-DEA model.

TI Computing under-ice discharge: A proof-of-concept using hydroacoustics
   and the Probability Concept

ID VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION; PROFILES; FLOW
AB Under-ice discharge is estimated using open-water reference hydrographs; however, the ratings for ice-affected sites are generally qualified as poor. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in collaboration with the Colorado Water Conservation Board, conducted a proof-of-concept to develop an alternative method for computing under-ice discharge using hydroacoustics and the Probability Concept.
   The study site was located south of Minturn, Colorado (CO), USA, and was selected because of (1) its proximity to the existing USGS streamgage 09064600 Eagle River near Minturn, CO, and (2) its ease-of-access to verify discharge using a variety of conventional methods. From late September 2014 to early March 2015, hydraulic conditions varied from open water to under ice. These temporal changes led to variations in water depth and velocity. Hydroacoustics (tethered and uplooking acoustic Doppler current profilers and acoustic Doppler velocimeters) were deployed to measure the vertical-velocity profile at a singularly important vertical of the channel-cross section. Because the velocity profile was non-standard and cannot be characterized using a Power Law or Log Law, velocity data were analyzed using the Probability Concept, which is a probabilistic formulation of the velocity distribution. The Probability Concept-derived discharge was compared to conventional methods including stage-discharge and index-velocity ratings and concurrent field measurements; each is complicated by the dynamics of ice formation, pressure influences on stage measurements, and variations in cross-sectional area due to ice formation.
   No particular discharge method was assigned as truth. Rather one statistical metric (Kolmogorov-Smirnov; KS), agreement plots, and concurrent measurements provided a measure of comparability between various methods. Regardless of the method employed, comparisons between each method revealed encouraging results depending on the flow conditions and the absence or presence of ice cover.
   For example, during lower discharges dominated by under-ice and transition (intermittent open-water and under-ice) conditions, the KS metric suggests there is not sufficient information to reject the null hypothesis and implies that the Probability Concept and index-velocity rating represent similar distributions. During high-flow, open-water conditions, the comparisons are less definitive; therefore, it is important that the appropriate analytical method and instrumentation be selected. Six conventional discharge measurements were collected concurrently with Probability Concept-derived discharges with percent differences (%) of -9.0%, -21%, -8.6%, 17.8%, 3.6%, and -2.3%.
   This proof-of-concept demonstrates that riverine discharges can be computed using the Probability Concept for a range of hydraulic extremes (variations in discharge, open-water and under-ice conditions) immediately after the siting phase is complete, which typically requires one day. Computing real-time discharges is particularly important at sites, where (1) new streamgages are planned, (2) river hydraulics are complex, and (3) shifts in the stage-discharge rating are needed to correct the streamflow record. Use of the Probability Concept does not preclude the need to maintain a stage-area relation. Both the Probability Concept and index-velocity rating offer water-resource managers and decision makers alternatives for computing real-time discharge for open-water and under-ice conditions.

ID JEJU ISLAND; NUMERICAL INVERSION; RECHARGE; INFILTRATION
AB A generalized water table fluctuation model based on precipitation was developed using a statistical conceptualization of unsaturated infiltration fluxes. A gamma distribution function was adopted as a transfer function due to its versatility in representing recharge rates with temporally dispersed infiltration fluxes, and a Laplace transformation was used to obtain an analytical solution. To prove the general applicability of the model, convergences with previous water table fluctuation models were shown as special cases. For validation, a few hypothetical cases were developed, where the applicability of the model to a wide range of unsaturated zone conditions was confirmed. For further validation, the model was applied to water table level estimations of three monitoring wells with considerably thick unsaturated zones on Jeju Island. The results show that the developed model represented the pattern of hydrographs from the two monitoring wells fairly well. The lag times from precipitation to recharge estimated from the developed system transfer function were found to agree with those from a conventional cross-correlation analysis. The developed model has the potential to be adopted for the hydraulic characterization of both saturated and unsaturated zones by being calibrated to actual data when extraneous and exogenous causes of water table fluctuation are limited. In addition, as it provides reference estimates, the model can be adopted as a tool for surveilling groundwater resources under hydraulically stressed conditions.

AB For forecasting monthly precipitation in an arid region, the feed forward back-propagation, radial basis function and generalized regression artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used in this study. The ANN models are improved after incorporation of a Markov chain-based algorithm (MC-ANNs) with which the percentage of dry months is forecasted perfectly, thus generation of any non-physical negative precipitation is eliminated. Due to the fact that recorded precipitation time series are usually shorter than the length needed for a proper calibration of ANN models, synthetic monthly precipitation data are generated by Thomas-Fiering model to further improve the performance of forecasting. For case studies from Jordan, it is seen that only a slightly better performance is achieved with the use of MC and synthetic data. A conditional statement is, therefore, established and imbedded into the ANN models after the incorporation of MC and support of synthetic data, to substantially improve the ability of the models for forecasting monthly precipitation in arid regions.

AB Complex rainfall situations can generate overland flow with complex hydrodynamic characteristics, affecting the surface configuration (i.e. sheet erosion) and environment to varying degrees. Reliable numerical simulations can provide a scientific method for the optimization of environmental management. A mesoscopic numerical method, the lattice Boltzmann method, was employed to simulate overland flows. To deal with complex rainfall, two schemes were introduced to improve the lattice Boltzmann equation and the local equilibrium function, respectively. Four typical cases with differences in rainfall, bed roughness, and slopes were selected to test the accuracy and applicability of the proposed schemes. It was found that the simulated results were in good agreement with the experimental data, analytical values, and the results produced by other models.

AB Research on water cooperation in the Eastern Nile Basin has focused on expanding policy and diplomacy tools for a better allocation of transboundary water resources confined to the river. Regional cooperation on water and related sectors such as energy and land expands the bargaining and areas for mutual gain, and thus enhances cooperation perspectives. This paper looks at the contribution and the potential benefits of a regional cooperation approach to addressing the underlying challenges of water diplomacy, such as complexity and distrust. It also promotes the understanding of river basins as a "resource basin" of integrated and linked resource-use issues, not always related to the river flow. The paper provides an analysis of priority issues for water- energy-food nexus in regional cooperation in the Eastern Nile Basin. This basin represents an illustrative case for regional cooperation and increased integration due to multiple comparative advantages inherent in the uneven endowments of water, energy and arable land resources, and to varying levels of economic and technological advancement among the three riparian countries: Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia. The paper also analyzes institutional arrangements on a regional scale, and elaborates on the inherent trade-offs associated with them.

AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral arachnoid cysts that eroded the skull base and extended into the paranasal sinus are very rare with only a few cases reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 71-year-old woman with history of headache for 4 years was evaluated because of an enlarging right temporal cystic lesion with evidence of resorption of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone and a fluid-filled sphenoid sinus. For 3 years, the cerebral cyst remained stable and minimally symptomatic. On her last magnetic resonance imaging, the cyst enlarged and perilesional edema was identified. The patient was treated with an open intracranial approach to explore the cyst. An arachnoid cyst was found which extended into the sphenoid sinus through a defect in the temporal fossa floor. The skull base defect was repaired using a muscle plug and fibrin sealant to obliterate the dural and bony defect. The arachnoid cyst was fenestrated to the basal cisterns.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral arachnoid cysts extending into the paranasal sinuses are very rare presenting mostly with rhinorrhea and nasal symptoms. Patients with neurologic symptoms may need intracranial surgery to fenestrate the cyst. Obliteration of the fistula into the paranasal sinus is essential to prevent further complications.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore the surgical methods and clinical effect of endoscopic endonasal approaches for the treatment of invasive pituitary adenomas (IPAs).
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis was made of the clinical data of 74 patients (75 procedures) with IPAs treated by different endoscopic endonasal approaches at the Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University from May 2014 to August 2017. The data include clinical manifestation, imaging features, surgical methods and complications, resection rate, cure rate, prognosis, and complications in different Knosp classifications and Hardy stages. The transcavernous approach was used in 47 patients, the lateral-cavernous approach was used in 14 patients, the tuberculum sella planum approach was used in 8 patients, and the diaphragma sellae open or dorsum sellae cut approach was used in 6 patients.
   RESULTS: The gross total resection (GTR) ratewas 70.7%(53 patients) and tumor residue rate was 29.3% (22 patients). GTR rate for pituitary adenoma according to Knosp classification was 89.3% in grade 3 and 28.6% in grade 4. The biology cure rate was 75.0% and 23.8%, respectively. There was significance between them (P<0.05). In addition, the GTR rate of Hardy stage was 90.5% in stage C, 90.0% in stage D, 26.1% in stage E, and the biology cure rate was 80.1%, 75.0%, and 13.0%, respectively. There was significance among them (P<0.05) Postoperative severe complications included 9 patients (12.0%) with cerebrospinal fluid leaks, 26 patients (34.7%) with electrolyte imbalance, 36 patients (48.0%) with transient diabetes insipidus, 22 patients (29.3%) with hypopituitarism, 2 patients (2.7%) with permanent hypopituitarism, and 2 patients (2.7%) with epistaxis. The follow-up lasted 2-41 months (average, 19.3 months). No patient experienced recurrence after GTR, 1 patient undergoing subtotal experienced recurrence and underwent reoperation, 3 patients underwent postoperative Gamma Knife treatment, and 2 patients with refractory IPA were given temozolomide and metformin chemotherapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: According to the invasiveness of IPA, choosing the appropriate endoscopic surgical approach is helpful in removing tumors and reducing complications.

   Trigeminal neuralgia
ID BASILAR IMPRESSION; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Trigeminal neuralgia is a rare feature of basilar impression, a complication of osteochondrodysplasic disorders. Microvascular decompression is difficult in medically refractory cases. Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) is effective for classical trigeminal neuralgia, and we first applied this GKS for a patient suffering from trigeminal neuralgia with basilar impression complicated by osteogenesis imperfecta.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 18-year-old man with type I osteogenesis imperfecta presented with a 2-year history of typical left trigeminal neuralgia affecting the ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular nerves. His condition was poorly controlled by carbamazepine and pregabalin. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed severe basilar impression and an elongated cisternal portion of the left trigeminal nerve. GKS was performed under local anesthesia. The middle part of the cisternal portion of the left trigeminal nerve was chosen as the radiosurgical target, despite the lack of neurovascular compression. The maximum radiosurgical dose was 85 Gy, using a single 4-mm collimator. The patient's trigeminal neuralgia improved by 1 month after GKS, and at 21 months after GKS he remained free of pain and medications.
   CONCLUSIONS: We report a case of trigeminal neuralgia resulting from severe basilar impression. Conventional microvascular decompression would not have been an appropriate treatment for this patient, so GKS was used. GKS is a simple and effective option even in cases with severe cranial deformity.

AB Transforaminal endoscopic spine surgery is an emerging technique in spine surgery, but it offers 2 distinct challenges to spine surgeons looking to adopt it: 1) targeting spine pathology and 2) understanding the endoscopic anatomy visualized through the endoscope. Intraoperative computed tomography (CT)-guided navigation is also an emerging technique in spine surgery that is becoming widely adopted for its benefits in assisting surgeons in localizing pathology and guided spine instrumentation placement. In this technical note, we describe a technique that uses intraoperative CT-guided navigation concomitantly with a transforaminal endoscopic approach to decompress a L4-L5 foraminal heterotopic bone formation after an oblique lumbar interbody fusion. The addition of intraoperative CT-guided navigation proved beneficial in targeting the pathology during the procedure and ensuring that the pathology was resolved by offering postoperative CT visualization of the decompressed neural foramen.

DE Avignon; Bonhomme; Brain; France; History; Neuroanatomy; Surgery
AB Although relatively little has been written of Jacques-Joseph Bonhomme's life (1708-1793) and contribution, his descriptions of the brain "Traite de la Cephalotomie" (Treatise on Dissection of the Head) were among the most accurate of his day. Published in 1748 in Avignon (France), this book remained a valuable resource to anatomists and surgeons as it was highlighted in many publications.
   Bonhomme was one of the first surgeons to study brain details in the skull's natural position. The brain was cut perpendicularly along the median line with new techniques of dissection (by the bottom of the head and not by the top). He has also been known for the accuracy of his illustrations.
   Bonhomme was appointed anatomic demonstrator at the Hospital and the University of Avignon, a prestigious position for a former "barber surgeon" at that time. His literary merits established him as a respected scholar of neuroanatomy during his lifetime. However, he did not have such a wide European reputation, probably because he had no access to a chair of anatomy.

DE Aneurysm; Neck massage; Stroke; Vertebral artery dissection
ID MANIPULATION
AB BACKGROUND: Vertebral artery dissection (VAD) is an important cause of stroke in young and a known complication of spinal manipulation procedures, although dissection following neck massage has rarely been reported in literature. Head and neck massage by improperly trained salon employees is very popular and widely practiced in developing countries like India. In the present report we present a case of VAD following neck massage.
   MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present an unusual case of VAD in a 30-year-old male patient following an episode of neck massage. He developed headache, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, diplopia, dizziness, and ataxia following the procedure. Initial history and examination suggested that the patient's symptoms were vascular in origin. We also discuss a brief review of the pathology, diagnosis, symptomatology, treatment, prognosis, and occurrence of this rare entity.
   RESULTS: Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed acute infarction of the left cerebellar hemisphere. Digital subtraction angiography showed narrowing and dilatation of the V3 segment of the left vertebral artery with narrowing of the V4 segment consistent with dissection, along with a cavernous segment aneurysm of the contralateral internal carotid artery.
   CONCLUSION: This report illustrates the potential hazards associated with neck massage. The vertebral arteries are at risk for dissection, which can lead to acute stroke. This case also suggests that careful history taking and awareness of the symptoms of VAD are necessary to diagnose this entity as timely diagnosis and treatment can prevent permanent disability or even death.

AB OBJECTIVE: Endovascular thrombectomy has become the gold standard for acute ischemic stroke intervention in appropriate patients. Occasionally, thrombectomy through the standard craniocervical artery related to the affected territory is not technically feasible due to patient-specific anatomic issues.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective review of cases where intracranial access was achieved via an unaffected circulation across the Circle of Willis.
   RESULTS: A technically successful thrombectomy is described in detail in 3 cases along with technical challenges encountered.
   CONCLUSIONS: Thrombectomy across the Circle of Willis is a potential bailout technique for select, complex cases. Further investigation is warranted.

AB PURPOSE: To clarify the safety and efficacy of flow diverter (FD) treatment for aneurysm in small cerebral vessels, we conducted a systematic review of the literature analyzing perioperative and long-term clinical and angiographic outcomes.
   METHODS: A comprehensive review of the up-to-date literature for studies with >= 10 patients related to FD treatment of small vessel aneurysms published was performed. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool the following outcomes: complete occlusion, technical procedural success, perioperative mortality, perioperative stroke, procedure-related morbidity and mortality, all complications, long-term mortality, and overall good outcome.
   RESULTS: We included 26 noncomparative studies with 572 target aneurysms. The technical procedural success rate was 96% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.93-1.00). At final follow-up, the complete occlusion rate was 70% (95% CI 0.64-0.76). The all-cause morbidity rate was 20% (95% CI 0.14-0.25). Procedure-related morbidity and mortality rates were 9% (95% CI 0.07-0.12) and 4% (95% CI 0.00-0.08), respectively. Overall long-term good outcome rate was 96% (95% CI 0.93-0.99). In the 3 subgroup analyses, complete occlusion rate of saccular aneurysms was lower than that of nonsaccular aneurysms (55% vs. 73%, respectively; odds ratio 0.40, 95% CI 0.17-0.98, P=0.04). The procedure-related morbidity rate and the good outcome rate were not significantly different in this subgroup. In the other 2 subgroups in which we compared anterior circulation aneurysms with posterior circulation aneurysms and single FD strategy with overlapped FD strategy, the rates were also not significantly different.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis demonstrated that FD treatment of small vessel aneurysms is technically feasible and effective with a high rate of complete occlusion. Although the comorbidities of patients cannot be neglected, the FD approach was associated with an acceptable rate of procedure-related morbidity and a satisfactory rate of overall good outcome.

   Systematic Review of the Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Review
DE Nerve sheath tumor; Neuromonitoring; Sacrum; Schwannoma
ID SURGICAL-MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Sacral schwannomas are very rare and typically have a benign nature. They occur in a permissive anatomical location leading to nonspecific symptoms that can result in them going unnoticed before reaching a considerable size.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a rare case of a giant sacral schwannoma (130 x 110 x 90 mm) in a 38-year-old man originating from the S2 nerve root, encompassing the neural canal with sacral erosion and extension in to the pelvis. The patient presented with a history of abdominal pain associated with increased urinary frequency and a sensation of incomplete bladder emptying. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a giant pelvic mass with sacral erosion and involvement of the nerve roots. Subsequently, he went on to have a 2-stage procedure in which complete resection of the schwannoma was achieved by both a posterior hemilaminectomy and laparotomy with the aid of neuromonitoring. The postoperative course was uneventful, with complete resolution of symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: We report one of the largest benign sacral schwannoma originating inside the spinal canal with pelvic extension to be resected without complications. We discuss our successful management and conduct a systematic review of the literature to provide the most up to date guidance on managing this tumor, including the application of neuromonitoring and a 360 approach in 2 stages.

AB BACKGROUND: Thrombosed large intracranial aneurysms (TLIAs) are not continuously contemplated as stable lesions. Spontaneous recanalization of completely occluded large intracranial aneurysms has been described previously.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a middle-aged patient presenting with agitation, acute headache, visual field defects, and left hemiparesis. A large thrombosed posterior communicating (PCom) artery aneurysm was identified with an infarct at the same arterial territory on neuroimaging studies. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) performed 1 week later demonstrated complete recanalization of the TLIA. It was treated endovascularly with coils. The patient returned several days later with augmenting headaches due to quadrigeminal system subarachnoid hemorrhage. Repeat DSA showed filling of the coiled aneurysm from the internal carotid artery injection. The PCom artery was catheterized and deconstructed. The patient was discharged to home with no additional neurologic deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: TLIAs are insidious vascular lesions. They can cause nerve or vessel damage by a mass effect or through ischemic stroke by emitting emboli into distal vasculature. We advise close periodic radiologic follow-up for TLIAs.

AB BACKGROUND: Posterior arch defect of C2 with an unstable spondylolysis is a rare condition mostly occurring within children. Its management is still controversial.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report in this article the first minimally invasive surgery (MIS) technique for this condition in an 8-year-old boy. A primary unstable C2 spondylolysis was diagnosed on the exploration of episodic paresthesia of upper limbs associated with headache lasting for several months. The surgical technique consisted in a direct pars repair through an MIS approach: METRx tubular retractor system (Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Memphis, Tennessee, USA), intraoperative C-arm fluoroscopy, surgical microscope, endoscopic spine instrument, and high-speed drill were required. Muscles were split and retracted. One-year postoperative course was excellent.
   CONCLUSIONS: After reviewing the past literature of this pathology, we discuss the minimally invasive posterior approach of the upper cervical spine. It is the first case, to our knowledge, describing direct minimally invasive repair for bilateral primary C2 pars defect in a child. Image guidance and surgical microscope help safe and effective screw placement.

   Carcinoma: A Case Report
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Imaging; Lumbosacral plexopathy; Perineural spread; Primary vaginal
   cancer
ID SCIATIC-NERVE; CANCER
AB BACKGROUND: Perineural spread is not an uncommon feature in carcinoma of the head and neck. On the contrary, perineural spread in pelvic malignancies has been rarely reported. This is the first report on perineural spread of the obturator nerve and the lumbosacral plexus from primary vaginal cancer.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old woman diagnosed with infectious spondylitis at an outside hospital was referred to our institution. She presented with persistent lower back pain and right anterior thigh pain. Magnetic resonance imaging and subsequent F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed primary vaginal cancer with metastatic lymphadenopathy and perineural spread of the lumbosacral plexus, including L3, L4 nerve roots and branches, and obturator nerve along with soft tissue masses in the right psoas and proximal adductor muscles.
   CONCLUSIONS: Clinical diagnosis of perineural spread in pelvic malignancies is difficult to establish, as it has nonspecific symptoms as an initial manifestation. Clinicians should recognize the possibility of perineural spread of malignancies if radiologic findings, such as thickening of lumbosacral nerves and perineural mass, are observed on magnetic resonance imaging. Further evaluation is necessary to detect possible pelvic malignancy and differentiate from other diseases.

   neuroectodermal tumor; Sciatic nerve
ID PRIMITIVE NEUROECTODERMAL TUMOR; FAMILY; ORIGIN; PAIN
AB BACKGROUND: Extraosseous Ewing sarcoma (EES) arising from peripheral nerves is extremely rare with only 11 cases mentioned in the literature. It poses a diagnostic challenge to the clinicians due to its nonspecific presentation and rare occurrence.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old woman came with a history of low back pain and intractable right leg pain. Physical examination revealed the normal motor power of both lower limbs with decreased sensation along the lateral aspect of the foot with decreased ankle reflex. There was no improvement with conservative management. It was a diagnostic challenge due to its presentation like a lumbar radiculopathy, which was further endorsed by magnetic resonance imaging findings of foraminal stenosis. Due to red flags such as unrelenting pain at rest and history of thyroid tumor, we proceeded with magnetic resonance imaging of the hip, which was suggestive of right sciatic nerve sheath tumor. Excisional biopsy was confirmed as EES, and the patient was subsequently started on chemoradiotherapy.
   CONCLUSION: A high index of suspicion is required for early diagnosis of EES. It can present as lumbar radiculopathy and mimic benign nerve sheath tumor on imaging. These sarcomas must be managed with a multidisciplinary approach.

AB BACKGROUND: Prolactinomas are the most common functional pituitary adenomas and dopamine agonists are the primary therapy. However, some patients are resistant to dopamine agonists. Recently, metformin has been proposed as a cancer treatment.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This study is a retrospective review of 2 cases including 1 patient with prolactinoma who was resistant to bromocriptine, diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance, and administered metformin. Surprisingly, combining the patient's treatment with metformin decreased prolactin (PRL) levels to 12 ng/mL and significantly decreased the size of the tumor after 1 year of combination therapy. As menstruation resumed and galactorrhea resolved, the patient became pregnant and stopped using metformin but continued taking bromocriptine. She gave birth to a healthy boy in August 2016. After delivery, she decided to breastfeed the baby and only took bromocriptine. After 14 months of using bromocriptine alone, her PRL level increased to 208 ng/mL and the tumor reappeared (7 mm 3 8 mm 3 9 mm). Interestingly, the patient's PRL level decreased from 208 ng/mL to 150 ng/mL 2 months after using combination treatment with bromocriptine and metformin. On the basis of these findings, a second bromocriptine-resistant patient was recruited. After 3 months of combined treatment with bromocriptine and metformin, the patient's PRL level decreased to 2.08 ng/mL, testosterone levels increased significantly, and the tumor size decreased.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although more cases and investigations into the mechanisms underlying these effects are needed, these 2 cases support the hypothesis that the combination of metformin and bromocriptine might be a new treatment for resistant prolactinomas.

AB BACKGROUND: Glossopharyngeal schwannomas are rare tumors. Clinical and radiologic presentation closely resembles those of vestibular schwannomas. Their clinical presentation varies from vestibulocochlear dysfunction to glossopharyngeal and vagal nerve dysfunction.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of a small glossopharyngeal schwannoma presenting with intractable recurrent sudden episodes of vomiting that subsided after tumor resection. To our knowledge, this is the only case in the literature of glossopharyngeal schwannoma presenting with nerve irritation in the form of intractable emesis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Small glossopharyngeal schwannomas can present with irritative symptoms of the ninth cranial nerve causing vomiting refractory to medical treatment. Intracranial imaging should be considered in the investigation of unexplained intractable vomiting even if the gross neurologic examination is normal.

AB BACKGROUND: Posterior occipitocervical fusion surgery is a commonly used surgical method to treat various craniovertebral junction pathologies. Though it is an effective method, there also have been some reports about complications of occipitocervical fusion. However, there have been no reports about posterior fossa epidural hematomas after occipitocervical fusion.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 44-year-old female was referred to our hospital with a 6-month history of neck pain and numb limbs for 2 months. On the basis of the imaging findings of the patient, the diagnosis was basilar invagination with atlantoaxial dislocation associated with Klippel-Feil syndrome and O-C1 assimilation. According to the principle of treatment, occipitocervical fusion surgery was performed. The operation was completed successfully, and the patient awoke from anesthesia 10 minutes later and went back to the orthopedic intensive care ward. Twenty hours after surgery, her mental status had deteriorated to a stupor, and both her pupils had dilated to 5 mm. Acute posterior fossa epidural hematomas were revealed by emergent computed tomography of the brain. Emergency craniectomy decompression and epidural hematoma removal surgery were performed for her in a timely manner. However, her mental status still did not improve and she fell into a deep coma. Her pupillary reflex disappeared, and then she died.
   CONCLUSIONS: Posterior fossa epidural hematoma is a rare complication of occipitocervical fusion surgery. Once it happens, it can be serious and even lead to death. It is important for the surgeons to realize that posterior fossa epidural hematomas may occur after the occipitocervical fusion surgery.

AB Intraoperative neurosurgical histopathologic diagnoses rely on evaluation of rapid tissue preparations such as frozen sections and smears with conventional light microscopy. Although useful, these techniques are time consuming and therefore cannot provide real-time intraoperative feedback. In vivo molecular imaging techniques are emerging as novel methods for generating real-time diagnostic histopathologic images of tumors and their surrounding tissues. These imaging techniques rely on contrast generated by exogenous fluorescent dyes, autofluorescence of endogenous molecules, fluorescence decay of excited molecules, or light scattering. Large molecular imaging instruments are being miniaturized for clinical in vivo use. This review discusses pertinent imaging systems that have been developed for neurosurgical use and imaging techniques currently under development for neurosurgical molecular imaging.

AB BACKGROUND: The traumatic complication of an arachnoid cyst (AC) with intracystic and subdural hematoma has been reported in many cases. However, a unilateral extradural hematoma (EDH) as a complication of AC is extremely rare. Most arachnoid cysts are unilateral and are located in the middle cranial fossa. Bilateral temporal AC alone is an extremely rare condition, and a bilateral EDH on top of a bilateral temporal AC has never been reported in the literature, to our knowledge.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 25-year-old man with a known bilateral AC who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and developed a bilateral temporal EDH. The brain computed tomography scan also showed fractures in the skull on both temporal areas. The patient was treated conservatively. He was discharge with Glasgow Coma Scale score of 5.
   CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral temporal EDH in a bilateral temporal AC has never been reported in the literature. The presence of an AC may predispose a patient to complications because of the anatomic changes in the area. It is important to educate asymptomatic patients and their families about these cysts and the importance of avoiding head injury and not being involved in contact sports or military service.

ID GUN INJURY
AB BACKGROUND: Cases of nail gun injuries to the head and neck are rare, and treatment approach varies with each case based on location and extent of injury.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a 52-year-old male who fell off a roof holding a pneumatic nail gun and accidentally shot himself with a nail through the right frontal neck region. The nail penetrated the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and extended intracranially through the right occipital condyle with its tip embedded in the right cerebellar hemisphere. The nail coursed between the right distal cervical internal jugular vein and right internal carotid artery. There was no evidence of vascular injury on initial imaging. The barbs of the nail abutted the right sigmoid sinus, making for high risk of tear and intracranial hemorrhage on manual nail extraction. Therefore preemptive coil embolization of the right dural venous sigmoid and occipital sinuses and internal jugular bulb was performed before attempted nail removal. Using biplane fluoroscopy, orthopedic screw removal plyers were successful in snaring the head of the nail. On initial removal attempt, the head of the nail injured the distal right cervical internal carotid artery, requiring endovascular coil embolization. The nail was then successfully extracted from the neck without further immediate complications.
   CONCLUSION: Use of biplane fluoroscopy and preemptive endovascular embolization makes a nonsurgical approach to penetrating skull base injuries feasible. Despite improving right visual loss related to the right internal carotid artery embolization, the patient had no new focal neurologic deficits on 1-month outpatient follow-up.

ID INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Hyperperfusion syndrome associated with aneurysm surgery is rare. The occurrence of the syndrome after trapping with high-flow bypass has not been described previously. Herein, we present a case of the syndrome that occurred after trapping with high-flow bypass of an unruptured giant paraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 68-year-old woman with progressive loss of vision in her left eye. After a diagnosis of left giant ICA aneurysm, she underwent successful trapping with high-flow bypass. No new neurologic deficits were observed after surgery. Computed tomography on the same day and magnetic resonance imaging on the next day revealed no hemorrhage or infarction. The patient had a headache and transit motor aphasia on postoperative day (POD) 8. Arterial spin-labeling magnetic resonance perfusion imaging on the same day and single photon emission CT on POD 10 demonstrated hyperperfusion in the left cerebral cortex. The symptoms gradually improved over a week, and she had no new neurologic deficits when discharged from hospital.
   CONCLUSIONS: This report suggests that hyperperfusion syndrome after trapping with high-flow bypass, although rare, should be considered in patients with giant aneurysm if they present with headache and neurologic deficits after a delay.

AB BACKGROUND: Nickel is the most common metal allergen and predominantly affects women. It is also the ubiquitous component in the alloys used to manufacture intracranial devices for aneurysm treatments, including aneurysm clips, self-expanding stents, flow-diverting stents, and endosaccular occlusion devices. Adverse events related to nickel allergy after deployment of such devices are uncommon but can be severe, resulting in dilemmas in the choice of treatment strategies and devices in managing nickel-sensitive patients with intracranial aneurysms.
   METHODS: A literature search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines to identify studies reporting on nickel-related adverse events in patients being treated for cerebral aneurysm. The materials of the culprit devices, clinical presentation, histological features, and treatments were reviewed. Clinical considerations and management options for nickel allergy patients were evaluated.
   RESULTS: Nickel is a major component of the cobalt alloy used in aneurysm clips and also of nitinol, which is commonly used in flow diverters and intracranial stents. Our literature review identified 9 articles reporting 10 unique cases of nickel-related adverse events after aneurysm treatment. Five of the cases occurred after aneurysm clipping, and the other 5 were attributed to endovascular devices. Two patients presented with dermatologic manifestations and 8 with neurologic manifestations, including cerebral edema and cerebritis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic complications related to nickel in cerebral aneurysm treatments are rare but remain concern owing to the high prevalence of nickel allergy in the population. Surgeons and interventionists should consider the metal allergy history and its potential clinical significance in managing nickel-allergic patients with aneurysms.

DT Article
DE Atlantoaxial dislocation; Isthmus; Posterior fusion; Vertebral artery
ID POSTERIOR
AB BACKGROUND: The vertebral artery (VA) may have an anomalous course in patients with congenital atlantoaxial dislocation. In such cases, the artery crosses the C1-C2 joint posteriorly. These cases need thorough evaluation of the VA course to avoid its injury during posterior reduction and fusion of C1-C2. We describe for the first time an unusual subisthmic course of VA in a case of congenital irreducible atlantoaxial dislocation (AAD). The surgical implication and possible embryology of such an anomaly have been highlighted.
   METHODS: A 25-year-male diagnosed with congenital AAD presented with spastic quadriparesis. Radiology showed irreducible AAD with oblique C1-C2 facet joints. The computed tomography angiogram showed the right VA traversing beneath the isthmus of atlas. The joint was opened, drilled, manipulated, and fused with a C1 lateral mass and C2 pedicle screw.
   RESULTS: The C2 isthmus was defined, and the C2 pedicle screw was inserted to prevent injury to the VA. The patient gradually improved and was doing well at his 6-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: The subisthmic variant of the VA may be the result of persistent C2 intersegmental artery. The presence of a subisthmic VA increases the chance of injury while inserting transarticular or C2 pars screw and warrants insertion of direct pedicle screw.

AB A 71-year-old man presented with neck and upper back pain to the emergency department. Magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic demonstrated a T2 vertebral lesion with epidural spinal cord compression. Considering the degree of severe spinal cord compression and the absence of a pathologic diagnosis, an urgent separation surgery was planned. A frozen section of the tumor from the paraspinal mass during initial exposure confirmed the presence of lymphoma, and hence only a T2 laminectomy and decompression were performed. Final pathology was non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Careful evaluation of the magnetic resonance image shows the presence of circumferential epidural spinal cord compression along with involvement of the posterior elements in a characteristic "wrap-around" fashion. Recognition of this finding may steer the surgeon toward a differential of spinal lymphoma, and its clinical importance cannot be overemphasized.

DE Antimicrobial treatment; Hypophysitis; Paranasal sinusitis; Pituitary
ID PITUITARY ABSCESS; MANAGEMENT; APOPLEXY
AB BACKGROUND: Sinusitis is a common clinical condition, but sphenoid sinusitis is a less common form and even rarer is hypophysitis as a complication of the latter. Clinically, hypophysitis may mimic a pituitary neoplasm in presenting with mass effect and pituitary hormone dysfunction.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present 5 cases of sinusitis-related hypophysitis treated at the Royal Care International Hospital in Khartoum, Sudan. Clinical symptoms at presentation included headache, fever, ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and history of sinusitis with running nose (nasal discharge). None of the patients were immunocompromised or showed signs of meningitis. Laboratory tests indicated neutrophilia and elevated inflammatory indices, namely C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. There was also a disturbance of the hypothalamic-pituitary hormone axis, particularly impaired cortisol level. Magnetic resonance imaging scans on all patients revealed swollen masses in the pituitary fossa and enhancement of the sellar region and paranasal sinuses, especially the sphenoid sinus. All cases were empirically treated with hydrocortisone and amoxicillin-clavulanate, resulting in reversal of symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Sinusitis is common in tropical regions where the climate is usually warm and often hot and dry. Here, the condition is considered a common incidental finding in magnetic resonance imaging examinations done for various indications. Hence it is not considered to be a serious health problem. Though our cohort of cases is small, we emphasize the importance of keeping a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis of hypophysitis in relevant case settings. This would help make an early diagnosis and ensure appropriate medical, perhaps nonsurgical, management.

DE Lumbar stenosis; Spine surgery; Surgical clip
ID ANEURYSM CLIP; RADICULOPATHY
AB BACKGROUND: Clips implanted during intracranial neurosurgical procedures sometimes migrate intradurally with rare cases of spinal migration. The appearance of radicular symptoms of topography concordant with the position of the foreign body leads to discussion about the optimal therapeutic strategy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 52-year-old woman suffering from L5 radicular pain resistant to medical treatment in the presence of L4L5 lumbar stenosis and a neurosurgical clip migrated to the L5S1 level. This clip had been implanted 19 years earlier during a surgical procedure in the posterior fossa, for resection of a juvenile astrocytoma. The imputability of this clip was deemed low given its location and history. A laminarthrectomy associated with circumferential arthrodesis of the L4L5 level was performed allowing complete improvement of radiculopathy. Surgical removal of the clip was not performed.
   CONCLUSION: Craniospinal migrations of neurosurgical clips are rare. Their imputability in the appearance of root symptoms is random and is based on a bundle of clinical, radiologic, and neurophysiologic arguments. Surgical removal should not be the standard treatment, especially if there is another cause of root compression.

AB BACKGROUND: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a relatively common tumor of the central nervous system. Although PCNSLs generally arise from the parenchyma, lymphomas arising primarily from the dura are termed dural lymphomas (DLs). Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue is the most unique histological feature of DLs. Because of its rarity, the clinical characteristics of and treatments for DL have not been fully elucidated to date.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 31-year-old man with no past medical history presented with numbness in his left upper limb. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a dural-based tumoral lesion and cervical lymphadenopathies. The lesion was diagnosed radiologically as a meningioma, and tumor resection was planned. However, an intraoperative pathological diagnosis showed neoplastic lymphocytes, and the planned total tumor resection was halted. Histologically, the tumor was characterized by areas of poorly defined follicular architecture consisting of medium and large centroblasts. These tumor cells were immunohistologically positive for CD10 and CD20 and negative for B-cell lymphoma (BCL) 2 and BCL6. Fluorescence in situ hybridization did not show evidence of an Immunoglobulin H/BCL2 fusion. The lesion was subsequently diagnosed as a pediatric-type follicular lymphoma (PTFL). Six cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) plus 2 cycles of rituximab were administered. The patient showed no evidence of relapse at 12 months after diagnosis, and follow-up was ongoing at the time of this report.
   CONCLUSIONS: This very rare case of DL was originally diagnosed as a PTFL. The tumor could be treated by immunochemotherapy alone.

TI Diffusely Infiltrating Cerebellar Anaplastic Astrocytoma Effectively
   Controlled with Bevacizumab: Case Report and Literature Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Bevacizumab; Cerebellar glioma; Diffuse infiltration
ID GLIOMATOSIS CEREBELLI; CEREBRI
AB BACKGROUND: Gliomas that show extensive diffuse infiltration from the cerebellumto the brainstem without masslike expansion are extremely rare. The efficacy of bevacizumab treatment for diffusely infiltrating gliomas remains uncertain.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 75-year-old man presented with a cerebellar anaplastic astrocytoma showing diffuse infiltration to the brainstem without a definite mass. He had experienced rapidly progressive nausea and dysarthria, as well as vertigo and headache for 2 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a poorly demarcated T2 high-intensity area in the right cerebellum and brainstem. The tumor in the right cerebellum showed sparse enhancement with gadolinium (Gd). Suboccipital decompressive craniotomy and partial removal of the tumor was emergently performed because of the rapid progression of symptoms and severe tonsillar herniation demonstrated on MRI. The pathologic diagnosis was anaplastic astrocytoma, and genomic analyses revealed no mutation in IDH1, H3F3A, or BRAF. During concomitant chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide, rapid worsening of the neurologic symptoms developed and significant enlargement of the T2 high-intensity area extending to the cerebral peduncle was seen, as well as a new Gd-enhancing lesion in the midbrain. After administration of bevacizumab, the neurologic symptoms gradually improved, the T2 high-intensity area decreased, and the Gd-enhancing lesion disappeared. At follow-up 2 years after the operation, no worsening of neurologic symptoms was seen and the residual T2 high-intensity area remained unchanged on MRI.
   CONCLUSIONS: Bevacizumab treatment may be a salvage treatment option for patients with diffusely infiltrating cerebellar gliomas that exhibits rapid progression during standard treatment.

   ARTHRODESIS; OSTEOMYELITIS; STABILIZATION
AB BACKGROUND: Vascularized bone grafts (VBGs) are described as having superior osteogenicity, osteoconductivity, and osteoinductivity compared with other graft types and have been used in high-risk patients to augment arthrodesis. Pedicled VBGs are rotated on an intact vascular pedicle and therefore maintain all the benefits of VBGs but avoid many of the challenges and additional morbidity of free-tissue transfer. This study describes a novel surgical technique for rotating vascularized spinous process into the posterolateral space for augmenting arthrodesis in patients undergoing posterolateral fusion (PLF).
   METHODS: A technique is described for rotating the spinous process into the posterolateral space on an intact vascular pedicle of paraspinal muscle. Early clinical and radiographic outcomes are reported for 4 patients who have undergone this procedure.
   RESULTS: Four patients were treated with a single or 2-level PLF combined with posterior, anterior, or lateral interbody fusion and vascularized spinous process graft. Three-month postoperative computed tomography scans demonstrated a dislodged graft in 1 patient and successful arthrodesis in 3 patients. Additional operative time taken for graft harvest and implantation ranged from 22 minutes for the first patient to 6 minutes for the fourth patient.
   CONCLUSIONS: Rotation of vascularized spinous process graft for augmentation of posterolateral arthrodesis in the lumbar spine is a potentially safe, effective surgical technique that results in successful arthrodesis in as little as 3 months but requires further study. This technique is expected to add little additional time or morbidity to the traditional lumbar PLF because it requires no separate incision or additional bone removal.

DE Epilepsy; Neurosurgery; Postictal delirium; Violence
ID PSYCHOSIS; SEIZURES
AB BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical brain interventions may result in lesions that can cause epilepsy. Diagnosis may be delayed in some situations. Meanwhile, violent behavior can occur during postictal delirium states. Although benign behavioral manifestations are well documented in literature, violent offenses in post-neurosurgical epilepsy have been rarely reported. Here we describe 2 such cases, focusing on management and emphasizing the need for prevention.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Both patients were suffering from post-neurosurgical epilepsy and offended during postictal delirium states. The first patient had generalized epilepsy and committed an attempted rape. The second patient had temporal lobe epilepsy and committed an attempted homicide. Both patients were well managed using anticonvulsant medication after the offenses.
   CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and regular follow-up are measures to take into consideration to prevent violent behavior in patients with post-neurosurgical epilepsy.

   TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY; CONTRAST ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY; SURGERY;
   ANESTHESIA; RISK; COMPLICATIONS; EXPERIENCE
AB BACKGROUND: The semi-sitting position is preferred in some surgeries of the posterior fossa and the cervical spine. At the same time, it is associated with a risk of air embolism. In the presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with an intracardial right-to-left shunt, an air embolism can result in a paradoxical embolism to the heart or brain. It is unclear whether the risk-benefit ratio favors the semi-sitting position in this scenario.
   METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the relevant studies published after 2007 by searching the PubMed, Science Direct, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases. Studies in which the presence of PFO was stated and the occurrence of paradoxical embolism was evaluated in patients who underwent neurosurgical procedures in the semi-sitting position were included in our analysis.
   RESULTS: We identified 4 observational studies with a total of 977 patients who underwent surgery of the posterior fossa or cervical spine in the semisitting position; among these, 82 had a PFO. Air embolism occurred in 33 of these 82 patients (40.2%). No paradoxical embolisms were detected.
   CONCLUSIONS: In experienced medical centers, neurosurgery in the semisitting position is feasible with acceptable risk even in patients with PFO. If the PFO is large, or if a permanent right-to-left shunt is present in a patient with a history of paradoxical embolism, it may be reasonable to repair the PFO before surgery if the semi-sitting position is strongly preferred. The risk analysis must be done on a case-by-case basis.

ID CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; OPTIC-NERVE; BRAIN; EYE; MR
AB BACKGROUND: Intraocular injection of silicone oil is commonly performed during vitrectomy to tamponade the retina in place for treatment of retinal detachment. Although rare, this intravitreal silicone can migrate through the optic nerve and chiasm and enter the cerebral ventricles.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we present a case report of a patient presenting with headache and intraventricular hyperdensities on a computed tomography (CT) scan, raising a concern for intraventricular hemorrhage. However, the intraventricular hyperdensities were in a nondependent location and moved to a new nondependent location when repeat imaging was performed with the patient in the prone position. We provide a literature review of this phenomenon and discuss the relevant CT and magnetic resonance imaging findings.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intraocular silicone can rarely migrate into the cerebral ventricular system. Careful review of the clinical history and imaging findings can help distinguish this from other, more dangerous intracranial pathologies.

Occlusion of the surgical opening of the ventricle using fibrinogen-coated collagen fleece has been suggested to restore the integrity of the ventricular system. Here we present a clinical image depicting an iatrogenic valve mechanism caused by a fleece intended to seal a surgical opening of the lateral ventricle, leading to development of a space-occupying tumor bed cyst and cerebrospinal fluid fistula.

DE Spontaneous resolution; Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma; Treatment
ID SPONTANEOUS RESOLUTION; CHILD
AB BACKGROUND: Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma (SSEH) is a relatively uncommon yet potentially disabling neurologic emergency. The classical presentation includes a severe acute attack, sometimes radiating pain at the back, interscapular, or neck areas, followed by neurologic deficits. The main treatment is surgical, and self-healing cases are rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 17-year-old female was admitted to the neurosurgery department with neck pain, myasthenia of the limbs, and difficulty moving. Mild neck pain had developed 1 week prior with no obvious predisposing causes. The patient had suddenly suffered severe neck pain during normal walking and developed rapid paralysis of her limbs. There was no recent history of trauma, infection, or drug administration. Magnetic resonance imaging performed 1 hour after the onset of limb paralysis demonstrated a large spinal epidural hematoma that extended from C4 to C6. However, 9 hours after the initial onset of severe neck pain, her symptoms completely ceased. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the SSEH had nearly dissipated.
   CONCLUSIONS: Most cases of SSEH with spontaneous resolution are located on the upper thoracic and cervical spine. Surgery is the standard of care for these patients but can occasionally be deferred if the patient demonstrates significant rapid improvement.

As stopping the stimulation caused recurrence of uncontrollable symptoms, radiofrequency lesioning was performed through the DBS electrodes under local anesthesia, and the DBS systems were removed under local or generalized anesthesia thereafter. The procedures performed were as follows: 2 patients had bilateral pallidotomy, 1 patient had unilateral pallidotomy, and 1 patient had pallidotomy and ipsilateral thalamotomy. As a result, in 4 patients, the dystonic symptoms did not worsen even after removal of the DBS systems during a follow-up period of 1-12 years. However, 1 patient had a small hemorrhage, and 2 patients showed recurrence of dystonia.
   CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency lesioning with DBS electrodes is feasible in cases of generalized dystonia when the DBS leads have to be removed.

AB BACKGROUND: Worth syndrome or autosomal dominant endosteal hyperostosis (ADEH) is an extremely rare genetic disease involving increased bone density. To the author's knowledge, this is the second case report of a family with neurologic involvement associated with this condition along with its surgical treatment. The most effective treatment for clinically significant neurologic symptoms in this scenario is currently unknown, and there is sparse experience on surgical treatment for this condition reported in the literature. Therefore we aim to make a contribution to the identification of a standard and consistently successful surgical management.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Two patients, mother (Patient 1) and daughter (Patient 2), were diagnosed with Worth syndrome. Both presented with the typical facial characteristics described for ADEH. Interestingly, Patient 1 presented the novel mutation in the LRP5 gene that is associated with different conditions involving increased bone density. Although neurologic symptoms are infrequent in ADEH, both referred chronic headache, nausea, and vomiting. Neuroimaging showed an increased cranial bone density and Chiari I malformation. The patients underwent a midline suboccipital craniectomy with excision of the posterior arch of C1 and duroplasty. However, due to a symptomatic recurrence 5 years after surgery, Patient 1 was reoperated on. We extended the craniectomy and also carried out a C2 laminectomy.
   CONCLUSION: After surgical interventions, patients' neurologic symptoms were successfully resolved. This report shows that posterior fossa decompression including duroplasty may be a valid treatment option in case of neurologic involvement.

AB The efficacy of endoscopic techniques in the surgical management of intra-canalicular vestibular schwannomas (ICVSs) has been underlined in recent studies. An endoscopic-assisted retrosigmoid approach (EARSA) appears to be particularly suitable for achieving complete resection of an ICVS. In this study, we describe the surgical treatment of 3 cases of ICVS with an EARSA, highlighting the advantages and limitations of flexible endoscopy in accomplishing a safe radical resection with hearing preservation. Three patients with an ICVS underwent surgery via a flexible endoscopic-assisted microneurosurgical retrosigmoid approach. Flexible endoscopic assistance allowed the identification of residual tumor located in the most lateral portion of the fundus of the internal auditory canal in all cases. Endoscopic controls and further microsurgical resection were attempted, and complete surgical resection was achieved in all cases without the occurrence of postoperative facial or auditory nerve dysfunction. Flexible endoscopy appears to be particularly useful and safe in the surgical management of ICVS by microneurosurgery via an EARSA.

AB BACKGROUND: There seems to be a pathogenetic link between hemodynamics and inflammatory arterial wall alteration leading to the development and rupture of intracranial aneurysms (IAs). Noninvasive assessment of the inflammatory status of the aneurysm wall may guide the management of unruptured IAs by identifying reliable markers for increased rupture risk.
   METHODS: We conducted a qualitative systematic review following the ENTREQ (Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research) framework. A search was made in MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL from database inception to October 2017 using the terms "intracranial aneurysm" and "cerebral aneurysm" linked with the following key words: inflammation, hemodynamic(s), remodeling, macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes, complement system, vascular smooth muscle cells, mast cells, cytokines, and inflammatory biomarkers.
   RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-three articles were included in the review.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, we explore the relationship between hemodynamic stress, inflammation, vascular remodeling, and the formation and rupture of IAs to develop novel strategies to predict the individual risk of aneurysmal rupture.

AB We describe the rare imaging of a plaque rupture at cervical internal carotid artery stenosis after balloon arterioplasty. The patient was an 82-year-old male who complained of left hemiparesis. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple high-signal intensity in the right cerebral hemisphere. Magnetic resonance angiography showed severe stenosis at the cervical internal carotid artery. We considered the high risk of hyperperfusion syndrome after revascularization. We planned staged angioplasty. Angiography after arterioplasty revealed a meshlike appearance, like a net, in the arterial wall, which indicated the critical sign of ischemic complications.

AB BACKGROUND: Dexamethasone has been used to treat cerebral edema associated with brain abscess. Whereas some argue that dexamethasone might aid antibiotic treatment, others believe that because of its immunosuppressive characteristics, it might have a negative impact on outcomes. How corticosteroid use affects overall mortality of brain abscess patients remains unclear.
   METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were utilized to identify all studies related to patients diagnosed with a brain abscess treated with dexamethasone. The main outcome of interest was mortality. Pooled effect estimates were calculated using fixed-effects (FE) and random-effects (RE) models.
   RESULTS: After removal of duplicates, 1681 articles were extracted from the literature of which 11 were included. These included 7 cohort studies and 4 case series. Indications to administer dexamethasone were either hospital brain abscess protocol or clinical presentation of cerebral edema. The 7 cohort studies involving 571 patients with brain abscesses comprised of 330 patients treated with standard of care (SOC) plus dexamethasone and 241 patients treated with SOC alone, after aspiration or surgical management of the abscess in either group. Pooling results from all seven cohort studies demonstrated a nonsignificant mortality benefit comparing SOC and dexamethasone patients to SOC patients (FE: risk ratio [RR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-1.37; RE: RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 049-1.82; I-2 [53.9%; P for heterogeneity [0.04).
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a brain abscess treated with antibiotics, the use of dexamethasone was not associated with increased mortality.

AB An 83-year-old woman presented with a lump on her left frontal region. One month ago, she fell and hit the ground with the left side of her head. However, she had no evidence of injury. After 10 days, a progressive, painless lump appeared where her head was injured. The lump was pulsatile, but it not obviously shrank subtly in size with compression of her left superficial temporal artery. The ultrasound examination in local hospital demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm. Head computed tomography showed an isodense subcutaneous lesion in her left frontal area. Further 3-dimensional reconstruction of contrast-enhanced computed tomography indicated an aneurysm from her left superficial temporal artery. The aneurysm was completely removed by surgery, and pathologic examination confirmed pseudoaneurysm. Because the pseudoaneurysm was large, the disadvantage of the endovascular treatment options could be a permanent lump. Our patient received a surgical resection without facial nerve damage.

AB BACKGROUND: We report a surgical case of entrapment neuropathy of lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) with anatomical variation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This 53-year-old man had a 10-year history of paresthesia and pain in the right anterolateral thigh exacerbated by prolonged standing and walking. His symptoms improved completely but transiently by LFCN block. The diagnosis was LFCN entrapment. Because additional treatment with drugs and repeat LFCN block was ineffective, we performed surgical decompression under local anesthesia. A nerve stimulator located the LFCN 4.5 cm medial to the anterior superior iliac spine. It formed a sharp curve and was embedded in connective tissue. Proximal dissection showed it to run parallel to the femoral nerve at the level of the inguinal ligament. The inguinal ligament was partially released to complete dissection/release. Postoperatively, his symptoms improved and the numeric rating scale fell from 8 to 1.
   CONCLUSION: We report a rare anatomical variation in the course of the LFCN.

DT Article
DE Microsurgical decompression; Nervus intermedius; Neuralgia
AB Nervus intermedius neuralgia is an extremely rare craniofacial neuralgia characterized by intermittent episodes of pain located deep in the ear that last for seconds or minutes and are often triggered by sensory or mechanical stimuli at the posterior wall of the auditory canal without any underlying pathology. Pain can be associated with disorders of lacrimation, salivation, and taste. Despite the fact that the majority of cases is idiopathic, reports can be found in the literature, where this neuralgia is secondary to a neurovascular conflict between the seventh cranial nerve and anterior-inferior cerebellar artery, posterior-inferior cerebellar artery, and vertebral artery or their branches. For these cases a microvascular decompression procedure can be considered a valid therapeutic approach. In a video, we describe microsurgical decompression of the nervus intermedius in a 40-year-old lady who described a 19-year history of short-lasting paroxystic pain felt in the deep external acoustic meatus on the left side, refractory to medical treatment, with no disturbances of lacrimation, salivation, or taste.

DT Article
DE Calvarium; Geriatric patient; Primary Ewing sarcoma
ID TUMOR
AB BACKGROUND: Ewing sarcoma is a rare primary malignant bone tumor, which mainly affects children and adolescents. Calvarial bone involvement and its appearance in elderly patients are extremely rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We presented a 68-year-old female patient with headache and right frontotemporal swelling. Imaging studies showed a right frontotemporal mass expanding to the Sylvian fissure. The patient underwent total resection of the mass, and pathologic evaluation ensured the diagnosis of primary Ewing sarcoma. The patient had adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis and efficiency of treatment for primary Ewing sarcoma of skull are unclear in elderly patients because of the sarcoma's rare appearance. Therefore more clinical evaluation is necessary. This case is the oldest patient presented in the literature.

   Hematoma and Transformation into a Subdural Hygroma
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Subdural hematoma; Subdural hygroma; Traumatic brain injury
ID PATIENT; REDUCTION
AB BACKGROUND: Spontaneous resolution of acute subdural hematomas (SDHs), occurring as the result of a traumatic injury, is well reported in the literature and rapidly resolving SDHs have been reported as well. Although the mechanism behind the rapid resolution of a SDH has not been well understood, there are postulated mechanisms for this phenomenon. The aim of this report is to present a patient who experienced the rapid resolution of a traumatic SDH, which was replaced by a subdural hygroma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This 25-year-old man presented to the hospital with an acute left-sided SDH after a head-on motor vehicle collision. At the time of presentation, the patient had an acute SDH with 11 mm of midline shift. The hematoma resolved spontaneously within 48 hours and was replaced by a thin subdural hygroma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Rapidly resolving SDHs represent a phenomenon that has been well described, although is not entirely understood. The imaging findings of this patient suggest that cerebrospinal fluid washout is a mechanism that promotes acute SDH resolution.

ID CIVIL-WAR
AB BACKGROUND: The demand for neurosurgical procedures increased drastically in the late 19th century owing to advances in ballistics during the American Civil War and Crimean War.
   METHODS AND RESULTS: Surgical care for a gunshot wound to the spine relied on skilled identification and removal of the fractured bone. Hemorrhage control and infection prevention were also imperative for improving survival rates.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although new techniques were implemented, the mortality rate from spinal injuries during this period was staggering. Nevertheless, those 19th century procedural methods provided the basis for present-day treatment for spinal injury patients.

DT Article
DE Osteomyelitis; Propionibacterium acnes; Skull; Varicella-zoster virus
ID HERPES-ZOSTER
AB BACKGROUND: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a common herpesvirus infection that can result in acute varicella/chickenpox, as well as delayed activation in herpes zoster/shingles. Ramsay-Hunt syndrome is a rare presentation of VZV reactivation, involving 1% of cases and resulting in lesion formation along the seventh cranial nerve distribution. We report the first case of a patient who presented with acute calvarial osteomyelitis after VZV reactivation and Propionibacterium acnes suprainfection.
   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old man with a history of VZV presented with a 6-month history of chest pain, flulike symptoms, and left-sided headaches. Several concomitant external calvarial lesions were identified, and imaging was concerning for an infectious or neoplastic etiology. The patient underwent surgical debridement, and pathologic samples identified coinfection with P. acnes and VZV. Antibacterial and antiviral therapy resulted in a good outcome.
   CONCLUSION: Osteomyelitis resulting as a complication of VZV infection is rare, particularly in the calvaria. This is the first reported case of Ramsay-Hunt syndrome-type VZV infection being complicated by osteomyelitis of the calvaria. Our case also demonstrates the diagnosis of VZV osteomyelitis through the use of current pathologic methods.

ID GIANT INTRACRANIAL MUCOCELE; ANTERIOR CRANIAL FOSSA; SINUS OSTEOMA;
   BRAIN-ABSCESS; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Paranasal sinus osteoma is a common, asymptomatic, histologically benign, slow-growing tumor. However, it can give rise to secondary pathologies such as a mucocele in about 50% of the cases. Rarely, intracranial and orbital extension is present, leading to rhinoliquorrhea, pneumocephalus, or neurologic and visual impairment, which might be potentially life-threatening.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 49-year-old man presented with an acute frontal lobe syndrome and rhinoliquorrhea. Cranial magnetic resonance tomography showed a suspected frontoethmoidal osteoma with a mucocele expanding intradurally into the left frontal lobe. It was accompanied by pneumocephalus and showed communication with the left lateral ventricle. Through a bifrontal craniotomy, in toto resection of the frontoethmoidal bony tumor and the intradural mucocele was performed, while thereafter the frontal sinus was cranialized using a pedunculated periosteal flap. Postoperative recovery was uneventful with complete resolution of the tension pneumocephalus and rhinoliquorrhea and led to an improvement of the frontal lobe syndrome.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present a rare case of pneumocephalus caused by a frontoethmoidal osteoma associated with an intradural mucocele. A review of the literature, focusing on the surgical strategies in such cases, is provided.

AB BACKGROUND: Calcifying pseudoneoplasm of the neuraxis (CAPNON) is a rare central nervous system lesion that can occur in both the brain and the spine. Although this entity is poorly understood, radiologic and histological features have been identified.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a unique case of a 31-year-old patient who was managed with antiepileptic medication for 17 years before requiring neurosurgical intervention for tumor progression. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed hyperintensity within the tumor with extensive associated vasogenic edema, which is not normally associated with CAPNON. Resection was successful with no complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present case illustrates the long-term natural history of CAPNON before resection and highlights the variations in radiologic appearance that may be associated with this poorly understood entity.

AB BACKGROUND: Peripheral nerve injuries often undergo surgical repair, but poor postoperative functional recovery is frequently observed.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe 4 cases of traumatic nerve lesions in whom postoperative recovery was prevented by complications such as detachment of nerve sutures or neuroma growth. To the best of our knowledge, no similar cases have been reported in literature so far. It is important to obtain an early diagnosis of such condition because it prevents recovery and delays reintervention, which should be performed before complete muscle denervation and atrophy.
   CONCLUSION: Nerve ultrasound is a valuable tool in traumatic nerve injury and has proven to be useful in postoperative follow-up, especially in diagnosing surgical complications such as detachment of nerve direct sutures.

   ventricular drain; Cadaveric study
ID ACCURACY; HEMORRHAGE; INSERTION
AB BACKGROUND: The standard freehand method for the insertion of external ventricular drains (EVDs) is associated with high rates of incorrect placement. Use of neuronavigation has been shown to reduce the rates of inaccurately positioned EVDs. We present a novel neuronavigation-based approach for EVD placement using flat panel detector computed tomography (FDCT) imaging.
   METHODS: Four cadaveric heads were used for neuro-navigated placement of EVDs using the BrainLAB reference headband in combination with laser surface registration and the precalibrated disposable stylet. In 2 cases, conventional multislice CT imaging was performed to reference neuronavigation. In the other 2 cases, preprocedural imaging was performed with FDCT. After inserting the EVDs, all heads were examined again with the identical imaging method as used before the procedure, followed by evaluation of catheter position.
   RESULTS: Our data demonstrate that FDCT imaging provides adequate image quality for referencing neuronavigation and performing navigated neurosurgery. All EVDs showed an optimal position in the ipsilateral frontal horn. Use of a BrainLAB reference headband combined with laser surface registration and the precalibrated disposable stylet affords the advantage of not requiring rigid fixation in a clamp.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our presented method is fast, accurate, and easy to use. Furthermore, this study is the first to demonstrate that navigated neurosurgery can be performed on the basis of FDCT imaging.

ID FORAMEN; MONRO
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral atrium diverticula are focal enlargements of the ventricular system that may develop in the presence of persistent intracranial hypertension, but they are rarely described in cases of acute intracranial hypertension. Here we present a unique case of obstructive hydrocephalus in a newborn due to the formation of a cerebral atrium diverticulum compressing the ventricular system.
   CASE DISCUSSION: A preterm 38-week-old boy was born with urgent caesarian section due to severe hydrocephalus. Magnetic resonance imaging showed the presence of a subacute right subdural hematoma with secondary obstructive hydrocephalus. The cystic lesion was characterized as a right ventricular atrium diverticulum. The child underwent urgent burr-hole evacuation of the right subdural hematoma with complete regression of the obstructive hydrocephalus and right atrial diverticulum.
   CONCLUSION: Cerebral atrium diverticula are rare focal dilatations of the ventricular system, and their radiologic diagnosis may be challenging. Accurate diagnosis of atrial diverticula and understanding of the underlying physiopathology is mandatory to establish the appropriate operative strategy.

AB BACKGROUND: Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a malignant bone tumor that is most commonly observed in the long bones, the pelvis, and the chest. Primary intracranial localization is extremely rare. -OBJECTIVE: In the aim of identifying the prognostic factors of this rare localization, we conducted a systematic review of the literature for patients with primary intracranial peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor/ES.
   METHODS: A complete MEDLINE search was undertaken for all articles reporting data for primary intracranial peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor/ES. We divided the patient population into 2 groups: group I, patients who were free of disease; and group II, patients who died or had uncontrolled disease at the last available follow-up. We conducted a comparative statistical analysis of data between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: A total of 48 patients were included in the review. There were 32 patients in group I and 12 in group II. Fifty percent of tumors in group II and only 16% of tumors in group I were infratentotorial (P = 0.03). Signs of bone involvement were observed in 19% of patients in group I and 54% in group II (P = 0.03). Total removal was accomplished in 29% of patients in group I and in no patients in group II (P = 0.03). Radiotherapy was performed in 73% of patients in group II and 81% in group I (P = 0.43). Chemotherapy was administered in 36% of patients in group II and 74% in group I (P = 0.03).
   CONCLUSIONS: Infratentorial localization and the presence of bone involvement were associated with poor prognosis; Surgery seems to be a predictive factor of prognosis; radiotherapy and chemotherapy must be performed whenever the tumor is not totally removed.

AB OBJECTIVE: In situ side-to-side (STS) revascularization is an intracranial-intracranial bypass technique that is increasingly used to treat complex aneurysms and cerebral ischemia. This sophisticated technique involves connecting 2 proximal parallel vessels to create an artificial conduit for blood flow. This study aims to provide a detailed description of the configuration of the STS bypass technique and extensive information regarding its technical characteristics, current anastomosis approaches, and surgical significance.
   METHODS: A literature search was performed using the PubMed, Medline, ScienceDirect, Embase, Wiley Online Library, Cambridge Journals, SAGE Journals, Oxford Journals, Research Gate, and Google Scholar databases. The terms "intracranial-intracranial bypass," "in situ bypass," "communicating bypass," and "STS anastomosis" were searched to identify pertinent articles. Articles involving in situ STS anastomosis combined with other bypass methods were excluded. Computer tablet-drawn illustrations of this technique are provided to enhance comprehension.
   RESULTS: In total, 70 articles that met our search and inclusion criteria were identified. Overall, the radiographic and clinical outcomes of 132 (125 aneurysms and 7 cerebral ischemias) patients who underwent in situ STS revascularization were analyzed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial-intracranial bypass in the STS fashion can be a safe and effective strategy for the management of complex intracranial aneurysms and cerebral ischemia and is particularly attractive in rescue, anticipated, and troubleshooting cases. Despite its extreme rarity, a de novo aneurysm may be observed after STS anastomosis; thus, long-term follow-up is mandatory. Vascular neurosurgeons should consider including this procedure in their treatment armamentarium.

AB BACKGROUND: We report the case of a 40-year-old patient with a large, World Health Organization grade III oligodendroglioma in the left parietal lobe.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Presurgical planning included functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) localization of language, motor, and somatosensory processing. fMRI results for motor and somatosensory tasks revealed activation in perilesional regions near the surgical resection as well as deactivation in the tumor for the sensory task, suggesting decreased autoregulation in the region owing to the glioma. fMRI results showed left-hemisphere dominance for language and activation in perilesional regions for all 3 speech tasks (i.e., word reading, picture naming, and semantic questions). In addition, the results demonstrated that the high vascularity of the lesion altered the blood oxygen leveledependent function, resulting in false-positive and false-negative activation in the semantic questions and leg/foot rubbing task, respectively. Intraoperative direct cortical stimulation was conducted in the regions corresponding to fMRI activation while the patient performed motor, sensory, and language tasks and showed no loss of function. Follow-up fMRI revealed that there was no longer activation in the tumor or in perilesional regions, presumably owing to the resection of the vascularized tumor.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of presurgical fMRI to inform the neurosurgical approach and emphasizes the need for careful interpretation of fMRI data, especially in cases of malignant glioma, which can decrease autoregulation in surrounding regions, affecting fMRI blood oxygen leveledependent signal.

DE Cystoperitoneal shunt; Tricompartmental arachnoid cyst
AB BACKGROUND: Arachnoid cysts constitute a mere 1% of all nontraumatic intracranialspace-occupying lesions, and only 10% of these are present in theinfratentorial compartment. We hereby report a case of a 10-month-old femalechild with a tricompartmental arachnoid cyst.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The arachnoid cyst spanned both the infratentorial and supratentorialcompartment of the intracranial space. In addition, the cyst was alsoherniating into the extracranial compartment through a congenital defect in theparietal bone. The child was brought to us with a disfiguring swelling over herscalp, which was progressively increasing in size. We managed the patient byexcision of the extracranial part and placed a cystoperitoneal shunt to take care of the intracranial part. Follow-up magneticresonance imaging after 6 months of intervention showed a significant reductionin the size of the intracranial portion of the cyst with no recurrence of theextracranial part.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case of arachnoid cyst involves multiplestructures. But interestingly, all these structures (arachnoid, dura, veins, and bone) are of mesodermal origin. So we would like to suggest that thispathology may be a result of developmental deviation during mesodermal differentiationrather than a simple expanding arachnoid cyst.

AB OBJECTIVES: Bilateral upper cerebellar hemorrhage is extremely rare clinical entity but relatively known as postoperative neurosurgical complication with as-yet unknown etiology. Here, we report a case of bilateral upper cerebellar hemorrhage due to pial arteriovenous fistula (pAVF) and discuss the possible pathophysiology of this bleeding pattern.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 4-year-old boy who was previously healthy presented with a sudden onset of headache, vomiting, and gait instability. Computed tomography revealed atypical bleeding in the sulci of bilateral cerebellar hemispheres facing the tentorium. Despite the symmetric distribution of bleeding, T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed flow void adjacent to the lateral margin of bleeding. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed increased apparent diffusion coefficient value in the hemorrhagic lesion, suggesting vasogenic edema. Vertebral angiogram revealed a pAVF, which was fed by the hemispheric branch of superior cerebellar artery. It drained via the venous varix, inferiorly into the tortuous and engorged inferior hemispheric vein, indicating venous congestion. On the venous phase of vertebral angiogram, the superior vermian vein, which is one of the main drainers of the superior part of the cerebellum, was not opacified. Transarterial n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate embolization was performed to prevent rebleeding, and the pAVF was treated successfully. The patient's follow-up has been uneventful for 3 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: We reported an extremely rare case of cerebellar pAVF presenting as bilateral upper cerebellar hemorrhage. Severe congestion of upper cerebellar veins seemed to be a possible pathophysiology of this specific bleeding pattern.

AB OBJECTIVE: Comparison of feasibility and safety between endovascular coiling versus neurosurgical clipping for the management of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) has been incrementally reported. However, economic comparison has been rarely reported. This meta-analysis aims at qualitatively and quantitatively analyzing the difference of hospital costs and length of stay between endovascular versus neurosurgical treatment in UIA.
   METHODS: MEDLINE, the Cochrane database, EMBASE, and Web of Science database were searched for cohort studies describing economic hospital cost or length of stay in patients with UIA. Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and rated quality using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Ravmen 5.2 was used to perform forest plot analysis.
   RESULTS: Nine studies describing 24,856 UIAs treated with neurosurgical clipping and 31,309 UIAs treated with endovascular coiling were included. Meta-analysis revealed that the total hospital costs (THCs) were similar between coiling and clipping in UIA patients (standard mean difference [SMD]: -0.33, 95% confidence interval: -0.68 to 0.02, I-2 [99%, P = 0.07). Subgroup analysis showed that THCs of coiling were significantly lower than clipping in the United States but opposite in South Korea. One-year medical costs of coiling were similar in both groups (SMD: -0.04, 95% CI: -0.08 to 0.00, I-2 = 0%, P = 0.07). In addition, the length of stay of coiling were significantly shorter than that of clipping (SMD: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.56-0.81, I-2 = 95%, P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSION: Generally, no significant difference in THCs and 1-year medical costs between coiling versus clipping in UIAs was observed. However, the length of stay of endovascular coiling was much shorter than neurosurgical clipping and decreased over time.

ID PUMPS; PAIN
AB BACKGROUND: We present a case of delayed progression of adhesive arachnoiditis to arachnoiditis ossificans (AO) in a patient being treated with a high-dose polypharmaceutical intrathecal regimen.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient is a 39-year-old Caucasian male who was implanted with an intrathecal pump in 2006 to control severe low back pain and administered intrathecal pain medication for a period of 10 years. In 2016, he developed new-onset radicular pain and worsened sensation in his lower extremities. Computed tomography scan of the lumbar spine at that time demonstrated profound calcification of the arachnoid consistent with a diagnosis of AO. It was presumed that prolonged high-dose intrathecal medication precipitated this condition, and his intrathecal medications were titrated down with removal of the pump.
   CONCLUSIONS: It is unlikely that his condition occurred as a result of prior surgery, with the more likely cause being hyperplasia of the spinal arachnoid, leading to scarring and calcification, due to the high-dose intrathecal regimen. This case highlights the delayed progression from stable arachnoiditis to AO concurring with a regimen of high-dose intrathecal medications. Clinicians should closely monitor patients undergoing intrathecal drug administration, particularly at elevated doses, for indications of damage to the spinal arachnoid mater.

   DURAPLASTY; ADULTS; DURA
AB BACKGROUND: The treatment options for patients with Chiarimalformation type 1 (CM1) and Chiarimalformation type 1.5 (CM1.5) have not yet been standardized. In these malformations, the main factors include obstruction at the level of the foramen magnum and dural and ligamentous thickening. Here we present our outcomes of surgery and decompression using a minimally invasive surgery (MIS) technique.
   METHODS: Sixty-one patients admitted to our clinics between 2009 and 2016 due to CM1 or CM1.5 and who had undergone MIS were investigated retrospectively. All patients were followed up for a mean period of 55 months, both clinically and radiologically, and the outcomes were recorded.
   RESULTS: All 61 patients underwent foramen magnum decompression through a 1.5-cm mini-open incision, C1 laminectomy and C2 medial inner side tour, posterior atlanto-occipital membrane removal, external dural delamination, and widening of the internal dura with longitudinal incisions. Fifty-six patients (91.8%) were satisfied with the outcome, 4 patients (6.5%) remained the same, and 1 patient (1.6%) reported a poor outcome. Forty-five percent of the patients with syringomyelia demonstrated resolution within 2 years, and 92% demonstrated resolution in 5 years. Scoliosis was seen in 5 patients (8.1%). The rate of benefit from the surgical procedure was statistically significant (P = 0.0045), and no patient required additional surgery because of poor decompression.
   CONCLUSIONS: MIS is effective for uncomplicated cases of CM1 and CM1.5 due to its minimal connective and muscular tissue damage, short surgical duration, short recovery time, early mobilization, effective posterior fora-men magnum widening, lack of liquor fistula development, and better clinical and radiologic improvement during long-term follow-up.

   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a spontaneously resolving right L4/5 JFC in an otherwise fit and well 60-year-old female. She presented with progressive chronic lower back pain and intermittent sciatica. She had no neurologic deficit. The patient was keen to avoid surgical intervention. After 19 months her symptoms had significantly improved, and repeat magnetic resonance image demonstrated complete resolution of the lesion.
   CONCLUSIONS: While surgery to remove a JFC +/- spinal stabilization remains the mainstay and definitive treatment for symptomatic JFCs, patients without neurologic deficit may be safely managed conservatively pending possible spontaneous resolution. Spontaneous resolution may reflect the natural history of the condition.

   surgery
ID SPINAL-CORD; RADIOSURGERY; EXPERIENCE; FEATURES; OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND: Intramedullary (IM) schwannomas are rare entities representing 0.3%-1% of intramedullary tumors and 1.1% of spinal schwannomas. Beside many theories proposed, their rare occurrence might be related to the absence of Schwann cells in the spinal cord. Pediatric IM schwannomas are uncommon, and in the absence of neurofibromatosis they are extremely rare. To date, few cases have been reported in the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe the case of an 8-year-old female affected by a progressive paraparesis. Neuroradiologic investigations showed an oval-shaped mass at the level of T10-T11. The patient underwent surgery, performed under neurophysiologic monitoring. The patient was operated on with complete removal of the lesion. The postoperative course was uneventful.
   CONCLUSIONS: The clinical, neuroradiologic, and intraoperative findings are presented, along with a review of the literature. Despite the number of lesions potentially compressing the spinal cord, IM schwannoma is rare but should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis.

   ANALYSIS
AB INTRODUCTION: There is increasing acknowledgement that surgical care is important in global health initiatives. In particular, neurosurgical care is as limited as 1 per 10 million people in parts of the world. We performed a systematic literature review to examine the worldwide incidence of central nervous system vascular lesions and a meta-analysis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) to define the disease burden and inform neurosurgical global health efforts.
   METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to estimate the global epidemiology of central nervous system vascular lesions, including unruptured and ruptured aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, cavernous malformations, dural arteriovenous fistulas, developmental venous anomalies, and vein of Galen malformations. Results were organized by World Health Organization regions. After literature review, because of a lack of data from particular World Health Organization regions, we determined we could only provide an estimate of aSAH. Using data from studies with aSAH and 12 high-quality stroke studies from regions lacking data, we meta-analyzed the yearly crude incidence of aSAH per 100,000 persons. Estimates were generated via random-effects models.
   RESULTS: From an initial yield of 1492 studies, 46 manuscripts on aSAH incidence were included. The final meta-analysis included 58 studies from 31 different countries. We estimated the global crude incidence for aSAH to be 6.67 per 100,000 persons with a wide variation across WHO regions from 0.71 to 12.38 per 100,000 persons.
   CONCLUSIONS: Worldwide, almost 500,000 individuals will suffer from aSAH each year, with almost two-thirds in low-and middle-income countries.

AB BACKGROUND: Ewing sarcoma is a malignant neoplasm that primarily involves extremity long bones, the pelvis, and soft tissues of children. The intradural extramedullary space is an uncommon location for Ewing sarcoma, and there is therefore a paucity of information regarding the features and natural history of this particular presentation. There is controversy regarding preoperative diagnosis, surgical management, and postoperative care, and there are no accepted standards.
   METHODS: Herein we present a 61-year-old man with an L1-3 intradural extramedullary Ewing sarcoma who underwent gross total resection of the tumor via laminectomy. Pathologic analysis revealed a diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma based on the characteristic immunohistochemistry and the presence of EWSR1-FLI1 fusion transcript by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.
   RESULTS: There have been 28 cases of intradural extramedullary Ewing sarcoma reported in the literature. Out of 29 cases including the current case, 18 cases (62.1%) were men. The median and mean ages were 32 and 34.0 years, respectively, with a peak age group of 10e20 years. Twenty-two of 29 (72.4%) cases involved the lumbar spine, followed by the cervical spine (n = 7, 24.1%). Long-term prognosis was poor, with 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year progression-free survival rate of 75.0%, 56.3%, 37.5%, and 18.8%, respectively. The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5 year overall survival rate was 89.5%, 80.5%, 80.5%, and 43.0%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we present imaging and pathologic findings of the case with review of the literature.

   LUMBAR DISKECTOMY; LIFE-SUPPORT; SURVIVAL
AB OBJECTIVE: Intraoperative cardiac arrest (CA) is usually attributable to preexisting disease or intraoperative complications. In rare cases, intraoperative stress can demask certain genetic diseases, such as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). It is essential that neurosurgeons be aware of the etiologies, risk factors, and initial management of CA during surgery with the patient in the prone position.
   METHODS: We present a case of CA directly after spinal fusion for lumbar spondylolisthesis and review the literature on cardiac arrests during spinal neurosurgery in the prone position. We focus on etiologies of CA in patients with structurally normal hearts.
   RESULTS: After resuscitation, a 53-years-old female patient achieved return of spontaneous circulation after 17 minutes, without any neurologic deficits and with substantial improvement of functional disability and pain scores. Extensive imaging, stress testing, and genetic screening ruled out common etiologies of CA. In this patient with a structurally normal heart, CPVT was established as the most likely cause. We identified 18 additional cases of CA associated with spinal neurosurgery in the prone position. Most cases occurred during deformity or fusion procedures. Commonly reported etiologies of CA were air embolism, hypovolemia, and dural traction leading to vasovagal response. In patients with structurally normal hearts, inherited arrhythmia syndromes including CPVT, Brugada syndrome, and long QT syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis and specifically included in testing.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although intraoperative CA is rare during spine surgery, neurosurgeons should be aware of the etiologies and the specific difficulties in the management associated with the prone position.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Acute hydrocephalus; Chemical meningitis; Complication; Lipomyelocele;
   Lipomyeloschisis
ID CLINICAL ARTICLE; NATURAL-HISTORY; MANAGEMENT; CHILDREN; LIPOMAS
AB BACKGROUND: A lumbar lipomyelocele is a closed spinal dysraphism that can cause tethered cord syndrome. Between 5% and 15% of spinal dysraphism surgery cases are burdened with complications, the most common being wound infections or dehiscence and cerebrospinal fluid leak. Acute communicating hydrocephalus has never been described as a complication of this type of surgery.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 6-year-old girl who had undergone several surgeries in another institution for lumbar lipomyeloschisis came to our attention for a second opinion about the management of her spinal dysraphism. During the visit, she experienced sudden loss of consciousness. An emergent computed tomography scan revealed an acute communicating hydrocephalus. External ventricular drainage was performed with quick recovery of consciousness. Further craniospinal magnetic resonance imaging revealed small droplets of fat in the intracranial subarachnoid spaces and ventricular system, suggestive of rupture of the lipoma with consequent aseptic meningitis.
   CONCLUSION: This is the first description of acute communicating hydrocephalus as a complication of lipomyelocele surgery. We discuss the possible pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to cerebrospinal fluid dynamics alteration.

AB OBJECTIVE: Health care-associated infections (HAIs) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) are prevalent; however, data describing epidemiology of infection are limited. This study reports incidence rates, risk factors, and the resulting SAH patient-related outcomes.
   METHODS: We studied the incidence of HAIs acquired in the intensive care unit (ICU) over a 6-year period. We used Bayesian Model Averaging to identify risk factors associated with an increased risk of HAIs, particularly urinary tract infections (UTI), pneumonia, and ventriculostomy-associated infections (VAI). We also examined the impact of HAIs on risk of vasospasm, ICU and hospital length of stay, and discharge disposition and adjusted for other risk factors.
   RESULTS: Of 419 patients with SAH, 66 (15.8%) developed 79 HAI episodes. Mean HAI incidence rates (per 1000 ICU-days) were UTI, 7.1; pneumonia, 4.3; and VAI, 2.4. The admission characteristic associated with increased risk of overall HAI, UTI, and VAI was diabetes mellitus. Hunt and Hess grades III-V were associated with increased risk of overall HAI and VAI. Male gender, intraventricular hemorrhage, and blood glucose level (>10) were associated with increased risk of pneumonia, whereas the incidence was lower in the presence of steroids. HAI was associated with increased length of stay of 10 ICU-days and 22 hospital-days, but not vasospasm or poor discharge disposition.
   CONCLUSIONS: HAIs are serious complications after SAH associated with prolonged ICU and hospital length of stay. Additional rigorous infection control measures aimed at patients with identifiable risk factors should trigger prevention, and early detection of nosocomial infections is warranted to further reduce the prevalence of HAIs.

TI Extended Length of Stay in Elderly Patients after Anterior Cervical
   Discectomy and Fusion Is Not Attributable to Baseline Illness Severity
   or Postoperative Complications

LA English
DT Article
DE Cervical fusion; Elderly; Enhanced recovery pathway; Length of stay;
   Postoperative complications; Spine surgery
ID LUMBAR SPINE SURGERY; COLORECTAL SURGERY; ENHANCED RECOVERY; RISK; CARE
AB BACKGROUND: Health care systems are increasing efforts to minimize postoperative hospital stays to improve resource use. Common explanations for extended postoperative stay are baseline patient sickness, postoperative complications, or physician practice differences. However, the degree to which extended length of stay (LOS) represents patient illness or postoperative complications remains unknown. The aim is to investigate the influence of postoperative complications and elderly patient comorbidities on extended LOS after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion.
   METHODS: This retrospective study was performed from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2014, on data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Patient demographics, comorbidities, LOS, and inpatient complications were recorded. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the odds ratio for risk-adjusted extended LOS. The primary outcome was the degree extended LOS represented patient illness or postoperative complications.
   RESULTS: Of 4730 participants, 1351 (28.56%) had extended LOS. A minority of patients with extended LOS had a history of relevant comorbidities-diabetes (29.53%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (9.4%), congestive heart failure (1.04%), myocardial infarction (0.33%), acute renal failure (0.3%), and stroke (5.92%). Among patients with normal LOS, 96.8% had no complications, 2.7% had 1 complication, and 0.5% had greater than 1 complication. In patients with extended LOS, 79.4% had no complications, 14.5% had 1 complication, and 6.1% had greater than 1 complication (P < 0.0001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests much of LOS variation after an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion is not attributable to baseline patient illness or complications and most likely represents differences in practice style or surgeon preference.

AB OBJECTIVE: As back pain is the presenting symptom in 95% of patients with epidural spinal metastases, appropriately identifying and treating the most symptomatic levels can provide significant palliation. The purpose of this study was to analyze the ability of combined positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) to identify spinal metastases with high metabolic activity and guide radiotherapy. We sought to correlate improvement in back pain with reduction in standard uptake value (SUV) after treatment.
   METHODS: Retrospective review was performed of 72 patients with spinal metastases treated with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy at a single center between 2002 and 2014. PET/CT was used to calculate SUVs for spinal metastases, and treatment planning was based on PET/CT results. Preoperative and postoperative pain levels were assessed in all patients.
   RESULTS: Reduction in pain scores was found in 78% of treated patients. A significant reduction in pain was identified in patients with >5 metastases compared with fewer lesions (P < 0.05). Degree of change in SUV did not correlate significantly with pain relief. However, comparing pretreatment and posttreatment PET/CT, patients with improved pain consistently displayed decreased SUV.
   CONCLUSIONS: PET/CT was shown to be a useful adjunct in radiation treatment planning with change in SUV correlating with symptomatic improvement. This study paves the way for future prospective studies to further assess utility and cost-effectiveness of this imaging modality in radiation treatment planning for spinal metastases.

AB OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) has become a mature and mainstream surgical technique for treating lumbar disc herniation (LDH); however, there is a steep learning curve with PELD, especially for puncture and foraminoplasty. In this study, we assessed the outcome and safety of a novel quantificational and targeted foraminoplasty device named ZESSYS for LDH.
   METHODS: From September to December of 2016, 70 patients with symptomatic LDH were enrolled in the study. The patients were assigned randomly to either the ZESSYS group or the conventional TESSYS group. We recorded the cannula introduction time, decompression time, radiation exposure time, intraoperative pain feeling score, visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and Macnab criteria score of the 2 groups. The mean follow-up period was 14 months.
   RESULTS: The average cannula introduction time (16.50 +/- 3.29 minutes) and the radiation exposure time (40.71 +/- 6.23 seconds) in the ZESSYS group were significantly reduced compared with the TESSYS group (cannula introduction time, 20.06 +/- 3.37 minutes, P=0.000; radiation exposure time, 49.20 +/- 7.84 seconds, P=0.000). Intraoperative pain feeling score in the ZESSYS group was significantly improved compared with the TESSYS group (P=0.021). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups for decompression time (P=0.617), Macnab criteria (P=0.769), or visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores at the same time point (P > 0.05). No serious complication was observed in any patients in either group.
   CONCLUSIONS: The novel targeted foraminoplasty technique with the specially designed double-cannulas is an effective and safe treatment for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. It reduces the difficulty of PELD learning, minimizes radiation exposure, and decreases intraoperative pain associated with foraminoplasty.

AB BACKGROUND: In adult Moyamoya disease (MMD), there remains controversy about the effectiveness of revascularization surgeries because randomized studies have not been performed to compare the efficacy of surgical techniques. This study was conducted to assess the most appropriate surgical treatment for adult patients with MMD.
   METHODS: Encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) was performed on 247 hemispheres in 145 patients. The clinical and demographic characteristics of patients were obtained via retrospective chart review. Clinical and angiographic states were evaluated retrospectively using quantitative methods. The mean duration of clinical follow up was 141.4 +/- 19.5 months.
   RESULTS: A total of 247 EDAS procedures were performed in 145 patients, including 15 EDAS performed using the occipital artery as the donor vessel. The mortality rate was 0%, and the permanent morbidity rates were 1.2% per operation and 2.0% per person. The mean modified Rankin Scale score was 1.21 +/- 1.31 postoperatively and 1.01 +/- 1.39 at the last follow-up. Of the 109 hemispheres studied, 45% were classified as grade A, 34% as grade B, and 21% as grade C collateral circulation. The annual rates of stroke were calculated to be 0.73% per person-year. Overall, the 1-,5-, and 10-year actuarial stroke rates were 2.1 +/- 1.2%, 6.8 +/- 2.1%, and 8.9 +/- 2.4%, respectively. Bilateral involvement was a common significant factor in any, hemorrhagic, and ischemic strokes. Hypertension was a risk factor for ischemic strokes during follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: EDAS is an effective procedure in a Chinese cohort of patients with MMD. EDAS resulted in satisfactory long-term improvement of clinical states and prevention of recurrent strokes.

AB OBJECTIVE: Glioma resection with fluorescein sodium (FNa) guidance has a potential drawback of nonspecific leakage of FNa from nontumor areas with a compromised bloode-brain barrier. We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of in vivo confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) after FNa administration to differentiate normal brain, injured normal brain, and tumor tissue in an animal glioma model.
   METHODS: GL261-Luc2 gliomas in C57BL/6 mice were used as a brain tumor model. CLE images of normal, injured normal, and tumor brain tissues were collected after intravenous FNa administration. Correlative sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin were taken at the same sites. A set of 40 CLE images was given to 1 neuropathologist and 3 neurosurgeons to assess diagnostic accuracy and rate image quality (1-10 scale). Additionally, we developed a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model for automatic image classification.
   RESULTS: The mean observer accuracy for correct diagnosis of glioma compared with either injured or uninjured brain using CLE images was 85%, and the DCNN model accuracy was 80%. For differentiation of tumor from nontumor tissue, the experts' mean accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity were 90%, 86%, and 96%, respectively, with high interobserver agreement overall (Cohen k = 0.74). The percentage of correctly identified images was significantly higher for images with a quality rating >5 (104/116, 90%) than for images with a quality rating <= 5 (32/44, 73%) (P = 0.007).
   CONCLUSIONS: With sufficient FNa present in tissues, CLE was an effective tool for intraoperative differentiation among normal, injured normal, and tumor brain tissue. Clinical studies are warranted to confirm these findings.

   METAANALYSIS; MANAGEMENT; DURAPLASTY; TYPE-1
AB BACKGROUND: Chiari I malformations are common in adults and a frequent procedure in neurosurgical practice. Despite several studies, there is no consensus about the indications or surgical technique for this common condition. Increasing emphasis on value-based care has emphasized reduction of readmissions and reoperations and is particularly relevant in Chiari, which has traditionally been associated with a high complication rate.
   OBJECTIVE: To provide a contemporary surgical profile of risk factors and complications for Chiari I malformations in adults.
   METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried to determine 30-day outcomes after surgery for Chiari I malformations in adults between 2005 and 2016. Demographics, clinical risk factors, and postoperative events were analyzed, along with reoperation and readmission reasons. -
   RESULTS: A total of 672 adult patients were identified in the cohort, with a female predominance (80%). The overall cohort readmission rate was 9.3%, and 6.8% of patients returned to the operating room. Obesity (45.7%) was predictive of both readmission and reoperation risk. Male sex and American Society of Anesthesiologists classwere predictive for reoperations. The most common reason for reoperation was cerebrospinal fluid leak, which was responsible for nearly two thirds of reoperations and 4% of the cohort.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgery for Chiari in adults is common and carries a definitive risk profile, including rates of readmission and reoperation higher than other common neurosurgical procedures. This cohort provides a representative sample of contemporary neurosurgical outcomes in surgery for Chiari I malformations.

DT Article
DE Craniotomy; Hemorrhage; High altitude; Infarct; Postoperative
   complications
ID SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; SUBDURAL-HEMATOMA; BRAIN
AB BACKGROUND: Postoperative hemorrhagic or ischemic complications cause significant morbidity and mortality after craniotomy. High altitude creates a state of relative hypoxia, resulting in increased cerebral blood flow for compensation. This potentially creates an increased risk at high altitude of having increased morbidity from hemorrhagic or ischemic events, and some neurosurgeons forbid air travel to patients immediately after craniotomy for this reason. We hypothesized there was no difference in postoperative complications based on altitude.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all craniotomies performed at a high-altitude medical center to assess whether originating, surgical, or destination altitude affected postoperative outcomes.
   RESULTS: Between 1 July 2014 and 30 June 2016, 1807 craniotomy procedures were performed. There were 53 (2.9%) postoperative hemorrhagic or ischemic complications during the first 30 days after surgery, 44 (2.4%) hemorrhagic events, and 9 (0.5%) ischemic events. From the 36 patients who had postoperative complications at the hospital, 10 of them lived in an altitude below the hospital, 26 lived in an altitude above the hospital, and 1 has no record of address. Excluding the patients who had complications at the hospital, we had 8 patients discharged to a ZIP code below the altitude of the hospital (7 hemorrhagic events and 1 ischemic) and 9 were discharged to a location at an altitude above that of the hospital (8 hemorrhagic events and 1 ischemic). There were no statistically significant differences between cohorts.
   CONCLUSIONS: Altitude does not appear to have a significant impact on postoperative rates of hemorrhagic or ischemic complications.

AB BACKGROUND: Deregulation of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) is always associated with development and progression of human diseases. We aimed to assess whether patients with brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) possess a distinct miRNA signature compared with healthy subjects.
   METHODS: Three patients with unruptured BAVMs and 3 normal control subjects were recruited as case and control groups. Peripheral blood was collected, and miRNA signature was obtained by next-generation sequencing, followed by comparative, functional, and network analyses. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed to validate expression of specific miRNAs.
   RESULTS: Deep sequencing detected 246 differentially expressed miRNAs in blood samples of patients with BAVMs compared with normal control subjects. For the top 5 miRNAs, 946 target genes were predicted, and a BAVM-specific miRNA-target gene regulatory network was constructed. Functional annotation suggested that 15 of the predicted miRNA-targeted genes were involved in vascular endothelial growth factor signaling, in which 3 critical miRNAs were involved: miR-7-5p, miR-199a-5p, and miR-200b-3p.
   CONCLUSIONS: We explored the miRNA expression signature of BAVMs, which will provide an important foundation for future studies on the regulation of miRNAs involved in BAVMs.

AB INTRODUCTION: Brachytherapy is a major adjuvant modality for neoplasms, but few have trialed its use for spinal tumors. This study examines perioperative and oncologic outcomes of patients with malignant spinal tumors who underwent resection with intraoperative phosphorous-32 (P32) brachytherapy.
   METHODS: Consecutive adult patients who underwent P32 brachytherapy during malignant spinal tumor resection were retrospectively identified from 2014 to 2015. Complications, tumor recurrence, and survival were reviewed. A comprehensive review of the literature was performed.
   RESULTS: A total of 8 patients were included. Average age was 54.3 years, and 25.0% were males. Tumor types included metastatic leiomyosarcoma, chordoma, multifocal recurrent ependymomas, breast metastasis, malignant meningioma, and myxofibrosarcoma. One-half of patients underwent en bloc tumor resection. P32 plaques were applied to 2 sites per patient for mean 13.1 minutes per site with a goal penetration of 10 Gy to 1-mm depth. Perioperative complications occurred in 3 patients (37.5%), including a persistent cerebral spinal fluid leak, deep infection requiring reoperation, and sacral insufficiency fracture. At a mean 25.6 months follow-up, local recurrence rate was 25.0%, and overall survival was 75.0%. Mean time to recurrence was 14.4 months. Survival at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months was 100.0%, 100.0%, 85.7%, and 71.4%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of P32 is safe and feasible. P32 intraoperative brachytherapy does not seem to increase the rate of complications. The sample size of this series is small with heterogeneity in tumor type, but recurrence and survival outcomes seem promising compared with previous reports. Further clinical trials are needed.

AB BACKGROUND: Overall complication rates for adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery have been reported; however, little data exist on the peak timing associated with specific complications. This study quantifies the peak timing for multiple complication types in an ASD cohort at minimum 2-year follow-up.
   METHODS: Multicenter, prospective analysis of all complications after ASD surgery in a consecutively enrolled cohort was performed. Inclusion criteria were ASD, age >= 18 years, spinal fusion >= 4 levels, and minimum 2-year follow-up. Complications included major and minor and specific complication types. Peak timing of specific complications was identified and described. Regression analysis was performed to assess correlation between patient/surgical factors and complication timing.
   RESULTS: There were 280 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Mean follow-up time was 2.9 years (range, 2-5 years). Of the patients, 209 (74.6%) had at least 1 complication, accounting for 529 total complications (258 minor and 271 major). Both major and minor complications peaked at <3 months. Infection and neurologic complications peaked at <3 months. Proximal junctional kyphosis had bimodal peaks at <3 and >24 months. Implant failure peaked at 12-24 and >24 months. There was a significant positive correlation between preoperative sagittal vertical axis and total complications at 6-12 months, major complications at 24 months, and reoperation. Body mass index was associated with total complications and implant failure at 12-24 and >24 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: The peak timing of specific complications after ASD surgery is identifiable. Understanding when these complications are likely to occur may improve patient counseling, early diagnosis, and prophylactic interventions and may help inform future reimbursement models.

AB BACKGROUND: Anatomic awareness of the structural connectivity of the brain is mandatory for neurosurgeons, to select the most effective approaches for brain resections. Although standard microdissection is a validated technique to investigate the different white matter (WM) pathways and to verify the results of tractography, the possibility of interactive exploration of the specimens and reliable acquisition of quantitative information has not been described. Photogrammetry is a well-established technique allowing an accurate metrology on highly defined three-dimensional (3D) models. The aim of this work is to propose the application of the photogrammetric technique for supporting the 3D exploration and the quantitative analysis on the cerebral WM connectivity.
   METHODS: The main perisylvian pathways, including the superior longitudinal fascicle and the arcuate fascicle were exposed using the Klingler technique. The photogrammetric acquisition followed each dissection step. The point clouds were registered to a reference magnetic resonance image of the specimen. All the acquisitions were coregistered into an open-source model.
   RESULTS: We analyzed 5 steps, including the cortical surface, the short intergyral fibers, the indirect posterior and anterior superior longitudinal fascicle, and the arcuate fascicle. The coregistration between the magnetic resonance imaging mesh and the point clouds models was highly accurate. Multiple measures of distances between specific cortical landmarks and WM tracts were collected on the photogrammetric model.
   CONCLUSIONS: Photogrammetry allows an accurate 3D reproduction of WM anatomy and the acquisition of unlimited quantitative data directly on the real specimen during the postdissection analysis. These results open many new promising neuroscientific and educational perspectives and also optimize the quality of neurosurgical treatments.

AB BACKGROUND: Several hypotheses have been proposed regarding the mechanisms underlying meningioma-related hyperostosis. In this study, we investigated the role of osteoprotegerin (OPG), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), endothelin 1 (ET-1), and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2 and 4.
   METHODS: A total of 149 patients (39 males and 110 females; mean age, 62 years) who underwent surgery were included. Depending on the relationship with the bone, meningiomas were classified as hyperostotic, osteolytic, infiltrative, or unrelated. Expression of OPG, and IGF-1, ET1, BMP-2, and BMP-4 was evaluated by tissue microarray analysis of surgical samples.
   RESULTS: Our series comprised 132 cases of grade I, 14 cases of grade II, and 3 cases of grade III meningiomas, according to the World Health Organization classification. Based on preoperative computed tomography scan, the cases were classified as follows: hyperostotic, n = 11; osteolytic, n = 11; infiltrative, n = 15; unrelated to the bone, n = 108. Four cases were excluded from the statistical analysis. Using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, we identified a 2% cutoff for the mean value of IGF-1 that discriminated between osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions; cases with a mean IGF-1 expression of <2% were classified as osteolytic (P = 0.0046), whereas those with a mean OPG expression of <10% were classified as osteolytic (P = 0.048). No other significant relationships were found.
   CONCLUSIONS: Expression of OPG and expression of IGF-1 were found to be associated with the development of hyperostosis. Preliminary findings suggest that hyperostosis can be caused by an overexpression of osteogenic molecules that influence osteoblast/osteoclast activity. Based on our results, further studies on hyperostotic bony tissue in meningiomas are needed to better understand how meningiomas influence bone overproduction.

AB OBJECTIVE: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established treatment modality for Parkinson disease (PD). The first DBS for PD in the Philippines was performed at the Philippine Movement Disorder Surgery Center in 2006. There are no Philippine data on DBS for PD. We aim to determine the motor improvement and reduction in medication dosage of all patients with PD who underwent DBS at the Philippine Movement Disorder Surgery Center.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective study of all patients with PD (n = 17) who underwent DBS from 2006 to 2016. The change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor and levodopa equivalent dose were determined.
   RESULTS: There was a statistically significant reduction in the UPDRS motor in all patients off medication at 3 months (48.2%; P = 0.004), 1 year (47.3%; P = 0.026), 2 years (48.4%; P = 0.021), and 3 years (66.0%; P = 0.032) after DBS and on medication at 3 months (43.3%; P = 0.023), 6 months (24.7%; P = 0.053), and 1 year (38.1%; P = 0.033). A significant reduction in the dosage of PD medications was also seen until the second year of followup (52.3%; P < 0.001). Adverse events included an attempted suicide and a device-related infection.
   CONCLUSIONS: DBS for PD improves the UPDRS motor score in the off-medication and on-medication state, with the maximal benefit seen at 3 years after surgery and reduces PD medication dosage by half. Although the benefit from DBS is undeniable, the high cost of the procedure precludes more patients from benefitting from it. There is a need for government support to expand access to DBS.

AB BACKGROUND: Endoscopic approach has been used increasingly for the surgical treatment of adult idiopathic bilateral occlusion of the foramen of Monro (AIOFM). The aim of this study is to assess and compare the results of this strategy with other surgical methods of treating AIOFM.
   METHODS: A retrospective study was performed to identify patients with AIOFM treated in our department from 2012 to 2017. We also performed a search of the literature to detect any case of AIOFM reported from 1980 to 2017 to provide a comprehensive assessment of the treatment of this condition. AIOFM was classified as 4 groups, including bilateral true stenosis of the foramen of Monro (FM), bilateral membrane occlusion of the FM, unilateral true FM stenosis with septum deviation, and unilateral membrane occlusion of the FM with septum deviation all assessed and discussed separately.
   RESULTS: We found four patients with AIOFM surgically treated with endoscopic procedures in our department between the years of 2012 to 2017 with an excellent outcome. Fourteen studies were also detected during our review of the literature, most of which involved treatment with neuroendoscopy and excellent outcomes. We found that neuroendoscopy could be the first-line strategy to treat all 4 types of AIOFM.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic strategy is associated with excellent outcomes and fewer risks in treatment of all types of AIOFM; it is also less invasive compared with ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion.

AB BACKGROUND: Lower cervical fracture-dislocations frequently occur with spinal cord injuries. There is no clear consensus on best treatment option. Anterior approach surgery with direct decompression and reduction has become widely accepted. We assessed clinical outcomes of anterior approach surgery in a retrospective cohort study.
   METHODS: From January 2001 to January 2011, 312 patients with lower cervical spine fracture-dislocation with spinal cord injuries who were treated by the anterior approach were retrospectively analyzed. Of 312 patients, 218 (70%; 121 men and 97 women) met inclusion criteria. Clinical efficacy was evaluated using Odom's criteria and statistical analysis based on Cobb angle of kyphosis and Neck Disability Index and Japanese Orthopedic Association scores. Neurofunctional recovery of patients was assessed by the American Spinal Injury Association system.
   RESULTS: Average follow-up was 8.9 +/- 2.9 years (range, 5-15 years). Kyphosis angle and Neck Disability Index and Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores were significantly changed from preoperative values of 10.6 degrees +/- 8.9 degrees and 39.7 +/- 4.3 and 7.6 +/- 2.4 to last follow-up values of -5.2 degrees +/- 8.6 degrees and 10.8 +/- 4.6 and 15.6 +/- 1.2 (P < 0.05). Of patients, 197 (90.4%) had good to excellent outcomes, 14 (6.4%) had satisfactory outcomes, and 7 (3.2%) had poor outcomes. Varying degrees of neurologic function recovery were shown by 143 of the original 218 patients (65.6%) and 140 of 191 patients with incomplete paralysis (73.3%).
   CONCLUSIONS: For lower cervical fracture-dislocation with spinal cord injuries, satisfactory clinical outcomes can be obtained with an anterior approach. The anterior approach restored normal cervical spine structure and promoted functional recovery to achieve a good long-term curative effect.

AB BACKGROUND: The association between underlying liver disease and poor surgical outcomes has been well documented across a wide variety of surgical disciplines. However, little is known about the importance of liver disease in neurosurgery. In this report, we assess the independent effect of liver disease on perioperative outcomes in patients undergoing craniotomy for tumor.
   METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database was queried for patients undergoing craniotomy for tumor from 2006 to 2015. Presence and severity of underlying liver disease was assessed with the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index and the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium scores, computed from preoperative laboratory values.
   RESULTS: Among 11,897 patients, mild and advanced disease was identified in 2.4% and 1.9% of patients, respectively. Rates of 30-day mortality were 4.5% and 15.8% in these patients, compared with 3.1% in patients with healthy livers. The 30-day complication rate was 40.3%, 28.0%, and 19.8% in patients with advanced, mild, and no liver disease, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the presence of any liver disease (mild or advanced) was independently associated with mortality (OR = 2.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.68-3.59; P < 0.001), morbidity (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.18-1.87; P = 0.001), and length of hospital stay over 10 days (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.07-1.70; P = 0.012), when compared with 13 covariates. Liver disease showed the strongest independent association with mortality of all risk factors analyzed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Liver disease is an independent predictor of poor 30-day outcomes following craniotomy for tumor. Consideration of underlying liver function can have a role in surgical decision making and postoperative care for these patients.

TI Reconsideration of Neurogenic Pulmonary Edema as Source of Metastatic
   Cerebral Abscess Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhages: A Preliminary Study
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article

ID FAT-EMBOLISM; PREVENTIVE ROLE; ASSOCIATION
AB BACKGROUND: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) may be a cause of neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE). It is well known that lymphatic fluid draining by thoracic duct to lungs consists of many dangerous metabolites, degraded tissue particles, and microbiologic pathogens. However, not enough studies have investigated whether NPE causes septicemia or not. In this study, we retrospectively examined our experimental materials to determine whether there is a meaningful relationship between NPE and cerebral abscess formation.
   METHODS: Forty-two rabbits were divided into 3 groups: Control (n = 5), SHAM (n = 7), and SAH (n = 30) with severe neurogenic lung edema detected in rabbits. The SHAM and SAH groups received 1 mL saline and 1 mL autologous arterial blood into the Sylvian cisterna, respectively. Weight, heartbeat, respiration rate, and blood pressure were recorded by routinely using monitoring devices. All multilevel lungs and brain tissue microsections were examined by stereologic and Cavalier methods. For statistical analysis, NPE criteria and the numbers of abscess or abscess resembling cores in the brains were estimated in all groups and compared. The Mann Whitney-U test was used to analyze the results statistically.
   RESULTS: All rabbits were around 4 years old; body weight was between 3.94 and 4.5 kg; normal heart rhythm rate was found between 251 +/- 39/minutes and 281 +/- 30/minutes; and respiration rate was between 24 +/- 5/minutes and 36 +/- 7/minutes. Histopathologic examinations showed that abscess formations frequently spread in middle cerebral arterial territories of all animals in the NPE-detected rabbits. While average abscess numbers were estimated as 3 +/- 1 in 7 animals (n = 7; P < 0.005) in severe NPE-detected rabbits, only 1 +/- 1 abscess core was detected in a less severe NPE that developed in 3 (n = 3; P < 0.05) animals. The vasospasm index values of pulmonary arteries (PAs) of all animals were 1.233 +/- 0.065 in the control group; 1.567 +/- 0.0430 in the SHAM group, and 2.890 +/- 0.0453 in the SAH group (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: This experimental study showed that NPE is a relatively common pathology following experimental SAH in rabbits. The NPE is frequently complicated with brain abscess as shown in this study. The pathophysiologic mechanism was concluded, as NPE may be responsible for cerebral abscess development via bacteria/cytotoxic particles conveyed by thoracic duct to lungs and transferred from the ruptured alveoli-capillary membrane to the brain by way of systemic circulation.

   MECHANISMS; IMPACT
AB OBJECTIVE: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is an acute cerebrovascular event that leads to devastating consequences. Early brain infarction (EBI) develops very early, within the first 72 hours after bleeding, and may have a significant impact on long-term outcomes. The incidence and impact of EBI in the prognosis of aSAH remain uncertain. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the incidence of EBI in patients with aSAH and determine its effect on mortality and functional outcomes.
   METHODS: We performed a systematic review and metaanalysis. Inclusion criteria were 1) studies that evaluated aSAH within 72 hours after bleeding; 2) performed a brain imaging study up to 72 hours of hemorrhage; 3) used computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging; and 4) included a description of the findings of the brain imaging study (whether or not an infarct was present).
   RESULTS: Ten studies that met the criteria were included. The incidence of EBI was 17%. The risk ratio for 3-month mortality was 2.18 (95% confidence interval 1.48-3.30). The overall risk ratio for poor outcome was 2.26 (95% confidence interval 1.75-2.93).
   CONCLUSIONS: EBI plays an important role in the outcome of patients with aSAH. Its significant impact could represent a new therapeutic frontier for improving outcomes of these patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Diagnosing normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) and selecting patients who will experience a sustained benefit from fluid diversion surgery remains challenging. This study seeks to evaluate the association between the callosal angle (CA) and the long-term postoperative response to ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery in a different subgroup population than previously studied to assess its generalizability.
   METHODS: We studied 72 patients with idiopathic NPH who underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery and had at least 18 months of follow-up between 2000 and 2016. We recorded their pre- and postoperative symptoms according to the NPH Eide scale and their comorbidities with the Kiefer index. Their CA, as well as Evans' Index, ventricular height, and transependymal signal were measured. Multivariable statistical models were used to determine which factors were associated with postoperative improvement while we controlled for the presence of the NPH triad.
   RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients (82%) demonstrated a successful response to surgery at their first postoperative follow-up. However, this declined to 54 patients (75%) at 1 year and 45 (62.5%) patients at their last follow-up. When we controlled for the presence of the triad of symptoms, the CA significantly predicted a good, sustained response to surgery; for every degree decrease in the CA, a patient is 4% more likely to experience benefit from surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The CA is a useful preoperative prognostic tool for predicting which patients will experience a sustained benefit from surgery. Further studies are required to clarify this disease in the context of old age, comorbidity, and possible concomitant neurodegenerative diseases.

AB BACKGROUND: The management of thoracolumbar posttraumatic compression fractures varies widely among centers, and there is no real consensus as to the optimum approach. The objective of our retrospective study was to detect the progression of vertebral kyphosis in nonosteoporotic patients treated by balloon kyphoplasty (KPB) who presented with recent compression fractures of the thoracolumbar region.
   METHODS: In this retrospective study, we investigated the evolution of vertebral and regional kyphosis in 77 patients treated by KPB for compression vertebral fractures (Magerl A) between 2007 and 2011. All treated patients, even those lost to follow-up, were included in our statistical analysis.
   RESULTS: In the 77 patients, a 2.4 degrees deterioration of vertebral kyphosis (P = 0.0004) and a 4.5 degrees worsening of regional kyphosis (P < 0.0001) were observed at the end of the follow-up period. No statistical correlation between the worsened kyphosis and the deterioration of long-term pain was identified. The mean visual analog scale score was 2.5, associated with very lowdisability on functional scores. A3-2 and A3-3 fractures are characterized by worsening vertebral and regional kyphosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: The paucity of studies of posttraumatic vertebral compression fractures in the scientific literature explains the lack of consensus regarding the optimum treatment approach. Postoperative results with KPB favor vertebral and regional kyphosis stability. KPB remains indicated in this situation except in cases of for burst fracture.

ID RISK-FACTORS; ATHEROSCLEROSIS; OUTCOMES; STROKE
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial artery stenosis (IAS) is the most common cause for acute cerebral accidents. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is the gold standard to detect IAS and usually brings excess radiation exposure to examinees and examiners. The artery pathology might influence the interventional procedure, causing prolonged radiation effects. However, no studies on the association between IAS pathology and operational parameters are available.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 93 patients with first-ever stroke/transient ischemic attack, who received DSA examination within 3 months from onset in this single center. Comparison of baseline characteristics was determined by 2-tailed Student's t-test or the chi-square test between subjects with and without IAS. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between IAS pathology and the items with a P value <0.05 in Student's t-test or chi-square test.
   RESULTS: There were 93 candidates (42 with IAS and 51 without IAS) in this study. The 2 groups shared no significance of the baseline characteristics (P > 0.05). We found a significantly higher total time, higher kerma area product, greater total dose, and greater DSA dose in the IAS group than in those without IAS (P < 0.05). A binary logistic regression analysis indicated the significant association between total time and IAS pathology (P < 0.05) but no significance in kerma area product, radiation dose, and DSA dose (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: IAS pathology would indicate a prolonged total time of DSA procedure in clinical practice. However, the radiation effects would not change with pathologic changes.

   SINGLE-CENTER; PREDICTORS; MANAGEMENT; OUTCOMES; STAGE
AB BACKGROUND: It remains unknown if ultra-early (within 24 hours after onset) treatment can improve the prognosis in patients with poor-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). We aimed to evaluate the effect of ultra-early treatment on functional outcomes and mortality in patients with poor-grade aSAH via a systematic review and meta-analysis.
   METHODS: We performed a literature search in the PubMed, MEDLINE, and Web of Science databases. Primary outcomes were death and functional outcome assessed at any time period. Secondary outcomes were the rebleeding rate before an aneurysm occlusion procedure and the incidence of intraoperative technique difficulty (ITD). The results are reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).
   RESULTS: A total of 14 articles containing 1111 patients met our inclusion criteria and were included in our analysis. The pooled incidence was 47% (95% CI, 40%-54%) for favorable outcome across 13 studies, 26% (95% CI, 19%-32%) for mortality in 11 studies, 10% (95% CI, 3%-16%) for rebleeding in 5 studies, and 20% (95% CI, 10%-31%) for ITD in 5 studies after ultra-early treatment of poor-grade aSAH. Compared with delayed treatment (> 24 hours), the ultra-early treatment failed to improve outcomes (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.75-2.01; P = 0.40) or reduce mortality (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.58-1.22; P = 0.45), but tended to prevent preoperative rebleeding (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.32 to 1.07; P = 0.08) in 6, 4, and 4 case-control studies, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show no significant change both in functional outcome and mortality between ultra-early and delayed treatment although ultra-early treatment may be associated with lower rebleeding rate.

AB OBJECTIVE: To delineate fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of compressed nerve roots in patients with lumbar disc herniation by diffusion tensor imaging and fiber bundle tracing and investigate the relationship between FA and ADC values and Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire and visual analog scale scores.
   METHODS: Twenty patients with lumbar disc herniation and 20 age-and sex-matched healthy volunteers were assessed using the Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire and visual analog scale. All subjects underwent conventional sagittal T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, axial T2-weighted imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging and fiber tractography.
   RESULTS: In 20 patients with lumbar disc herniation, there were 31 nerve roots involved (9/31 L4, 15/31 L5, and 7/31 S1). Mean Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire scores of patients were 53.55% +/- 11.91%, and mean visual analog scale scores were 5.96 +/- 1.64. FA values of lumbar nerve roots were 0.332 +/- 0.014 in healthy volunteers. FA values of compressed lumbar nerve roots were 0.251 +/- 0.022, significantly lower than FA values of contralateral non-compressed nerve roots and lumbar nerve roots of healthy volunteers. ADC values of lumbar nerve roots were 1.763 +/- 0.075 in healthy volunteers. ADC values of compressed lumbar nerve roots were 2.090 +/- 0.078, significantly higher than ADC values of contralateral noncompressed nerve roots and lumbar nerve roots of healthy volunteers.
   CONCLUSIONS: Fiber tractography is capable of delineating microstructural changes of lumbosacral nerve roots, and radiculopathy in lumbar disc herniation is associated with significant changes in FA and ADC values.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify independent risk factors, additional length of stay, and additional cost associated with postoperative ileus following anterior lumbar interbody fusion in elderly patients.
   METHODS: The PearlDiver Patient Records Database was queried for all Medicare patients >= 65 years of age undergoing 1- or 2-level primary elective anterior lumbar interbody fusion from 2005 to 2014. Independent risk factors, additional length of stay, and additional cost associated with postoperative ileus were evaluated with multivariate analysis.
   RESULTS: There were 13,139 patients identified, and 642 patients experienced postoperative ileus within 3 days after surgery. Multivariate analysis identified perioperative fluid or electrolyte imbalance (odds ratio = 4.03; 95% confidence interval, 3.37-4.80; P < 0.001) and male sex (odds ratio = 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.48-2.00; P < 0.001) as independent risk factors for ileus. Multivariate analysis associated postoperative ileus with additional length of stay of 2.83 +/- 0.11 days (P < 0.001) and additional cost of $2,349 +/- $419 (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with perioperative fluid and electrolyte imbalances were 4 times as likely to experience postoperative ileus. Fluid balance and electrolyte levels should be carefully monitored during the perioperative period in patients undergoing anterior lumbar interbody fusion as a potential means to reduce the incidence of postoperative ileus and the additional length of stay and cost burden associated with this complication.

ID COMBINATION
AB BACKGROUND: Limited historical data suggest that concomitant placement of both a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube is associated with an increased risk of complications, including VP shunt infections. Here we compare the outcomes and cost difference between 2 groups of patients, one in which a VP shunt and PEG tube were placed in the same operation and the other in which separate operations were performed.
   METHODS: A total of 10 patients underwent simultaneous placement of a VP shunt and PEG tube. This group was compared with a group of 18 patients that underwent separate placements. Hospital billing charges were used to compare the total cost of the procedures in the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: Eight of the 10 patients presented with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The average length of stay was 25 +/- 2 days for the simultaneous procedure group and 43 +/- 7 days for the separate procedures group. The average duration of follow-up was 12 +/- 3 months after simultaneous placement. No patient in the simultaneous surgery group had signs of infection or shunt malfunction at last follow-up. The overall complication rate was significantly lower in the simultaneous surgery group. A cost analysis demonstrated significant cost savings by completing both procedures in the same surgical procedure.
   CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous placement of a PEG tube and VP shunt is safe, efficacious, and cost-effective. Thus, in patients requiring both a VP shunt and PEG tube, placement of both devices in a single surgical procedure should be considered.

ID INCIDENTAL FINDINGS; CLINICAL-FEATURES; FOSSA; CHILDREN; DECOMPRESSION;
   POPULATION; EXPERIENCE
AB BACKGROUND: Outcomes of surgical treated patients with giant retrocerebellar arachnoid cysts with the available typically preferred techniques frequently are unsatisfactory.
   OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that a pressure gradient may exist between the cyst and the ventricular system that may be responsible for the posterior fossa-related symptoms and headaches, and, if so, that connecting both cavities by means of a shunt catheter (i.e., cystoventricular stent), the pressure differences would equilibrate and the symptoms resolve. To prove our hypothesis, we decided to simultaneously monitor the intracyst pressure and the intraventricular pressure.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review analysis of 5 consecutive patients with giant retrocerebellar arachnoid cysts treated between 2014 and 2016.
   RESULTS: Four patients underwent 3 days of continuous intracranial pressure monitoring, and 1 patient was monitored in the surgical suit. Cyst and ventricular pressures tended to be within normal accepted values in all patients, and a pressure gradient was noticed only in the 2 patients with previous cyst surgeries. All patients were treated with a cystoventricular stent, and overall, had long-term sustained good outcomes, with resolution of symptoms in 3 and significant improvement in 2.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with symptomatic large retrocerebellar arachnoid cysts do not seem to have increased intracranial pressure, and regardless of the presence or absence of a pressure gradient between the cyst and the ventricles, a cystoventricular stent seems to be effective and the best first surgical option to offer.

AB OBJECTIVE: Pediatric intramedullary spinal cord ependymomas represent a rare central nervous system neoplasm with few available data regarding incidence and outcomes. To this end, large population-based studies are needed to assess the epidemiology and survival risk factors associated with these tumors in the hope of better understanding these tumors as well as improving outcomes. This retrospective study was undertaken to explore factors that may influence survival in pediatric patients with intramedullary spinal cord ependymomas.
   METHODS: Using the SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) database, a prospective cancer registry, we retrospectively assessed survival in histologically confirmed spinal ependymomas in patients 17 years of age and younger. Survival was described with Kaplan-Meier curves, and a multivariate regression analysis was used to assess the association of several variables with survival, controlling for confounding variables.
   RESULTS: Invasive tumor extension (P < 0.001) was associated with decreased survival, whereas gross total resection (P = 0.028) correlated with better rates of survival. Age, gender, tumor size, tumor extension, the use and sequence of radiation therapy, or use of chemotherapy were not found to have a statistically significant association with survival outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Invasive ependymomas occurring in the spine have a worse prognosis, whereas higher tumor grades do not clearly show worse rates of survival. Early diagnosis and surgery seem to be associated with improved survival and outcomes, whereas radiation therapy and chemotherapy have an unclear role.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the utility of an endoscopic transseptal approach and creation of a bilateral nasoseptal flap using a 2-nostrils/4-hands technique in patients with challenging skull-base tumors.
   METHODS: The medical records of patients operated on via an endoscopic transseptal approach between 2009 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Two patients with ossifying fibroma, 2 with orbital hemangioma, 2 with trigeminal nerve schwannoma, and 1 patient each with juvenile angiofibroma, meningioma, and myxofibrosarcoma were included in the study. The surgical technique and endoscopic anatomy are presented.
   RESULTS: The mean age of the 4 male and 5 female patients was 39.9 +/- 14.8 years. By using this technique, all 7 tumors were resected with minimal nasal morbidity after a mean follow-up of 15.2 +/- 9.4 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: The endoscopic transseptal approach, by creation of a bilateral nasoseptal flap using a 2-nostrils/4-hands technique, improves surgical visualization and increases instrument maneuverability. Surgical access to challenging skull-base tumors is therefore afforded. The procedure also reduces nasal morbidity by preserving the lacrimal apparatus and anterior maxilla structures and avoiding septal perforation and traumatic nose traction.

AB BACKGROUND: The optimal management of indirect traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) is controversial. We aimed to compare the differences in visual improvement by treatment option in patients presenting with TON and no light perception (NLP). We also wanted to identify any patient-related factors that might favor the use of steroid pulse therapy or optic nerve decompression (OND).
   METHODS: We retrospectively identified 46 consecutive patients with indirect TON treated at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between 2007 and 2015. The outcome was the improvement in visual acuity by improvement rate and degree of improvement.
   RESULTS: Females had a better improvement rate than did males. Compared with delayed treatment, patients receiving steroid pulse therapy within 14 hours or receiving OND within 26 hours had a better improvement rate/degree. In patients with an initial intraocular pressure (IOP) of 17-23 mm Hg, the improvement rate/degree was significantly better than for patients with an IOP outside this range. For patients treated by OND, an initially normal IOP (11-21 mm Hg) suggested a significantly better prognosis in the improvement rate/degree.
   CONCLUSIONS: For patients with indirect TON, initial NLP implies a poor prognosis, but steroid pulse therapy or OND are both feasible treatment options. These results emphasize the importance of timely treatment for patients with indirect TON and NLP. Females and patients with an initial IOP of 17-23 mm Hg were more likely to recover. The results of our study indicate that normal initial IOP (11-21 mm Hg) is good prognostic factor for patients with indirect TON treated with OND.

AB BACKGROUND: Although tumor size affects survival of patients with lower-grade glioma, a prognostic effect on patients with glioblastoma remains to be established.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 61 patients using volumetric data of tumor compartments of 61 patients obtained by preoperative magnetic resonance images using the visual ABC/2 method. Preoperative enhancing, nonenhancing, necrosis, and edema volume, the preoperative tumor area (TA) as a product of the 2 largest tumor diameters perpendicular to each other on axial T1-weighted postcontrast images, as well as postoperative enhancing residual volumes, were measured. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to associate these parameters with overall survival, adjusting for potential confounders.
   RESULTS: The median preoperative enhancing tumor volume was 18.2 mL (interquartile range, 8.2-41.7 mL); the median remnant tumor volume was 1.3% (interquartile range, 0.0%-42.9%). During follow-up, 59 patients (92%) died; median survival time and median follow-up time were both 404 days. We found a statistically significant multiplicative effect of TA on survival: the hazard ratio (HR) was increased by 1.096 per unit increase of 200 mm(2) (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.027-1.170; P < 0.01). The effect of remnant tumor on HR increased multiplicatively by 1.013 (95% CI, 1.001-1.026; P = 0.04) per unit increase of 1 log (day) and 1% in tumor remnant. HR associated with age at surgery increased by 1.503 per 5 years of age (95% CI, 1.243-1.817; P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative TA proved to be the only glioblastoma size parameter that affects patient survival.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the effect of burr-hole craniostomy with T-tube drainage to treat chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH).
   METHODS: Eighty-seven patients with CSDH who were recruited from January 2012 to June 2017 at the Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Medical University, were divided into 2 groups according to the method of drainage: T-tube drainage system (n = 45) and conventional subdural drainage system (n = 42). Retrospective analysis of clinical data and efficacy was performed between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age, preoperative Markwalder grade scale, preoperative hematoma volume, hospitalization days, and discharge Markwalder grade scale between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). The incidence of postoperative complications and hematoma recurrence in the group of patients with T-tube drainage was significantly reduced when compared with conventional subdural drainage systems (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Both methods were effective in the treatment of CSDH; however, we found a lower overall surgical complication rate following treatment with burr-hole craniostomy and T-tube drainage. This indicates that it may be a better therapeutic option for management of CSDH.

AB BACKGROUND: It is difficult to differentiate patients with cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cholesteatoma and patients with primary trigeminal neuralgia just according to early symptoms. We aimed to explore the clinical characteristics, early diagnosis, and microneurosurgical techniques for CPA cholesteatoma that presented as trigeminal neuralgia.
   METHODS: The data of 26 patients who complained trigeminal neuralgia with CPA cholesteatoma between January 2009 and December 2015 were collected and studied retrospectively, they were diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging preoperatively and confirmed by pathology postoperatively. All the tumors were resected through a retrosigmoidal approach. In 26 cases, 14 patients who underwent cholesteatoma resection and microvascular decompression were assigned to group A and 12 patients who underwent only cholesteatoma resection were assigned to group B. The clinical features and surgical results between groups A and B were compared. The complications and surgical results were followed up, and surgical techniques were summarized.
   RESULTS: All patients presented as trigeminal neuralgia at the same side of the cholesteatoma. There was no statistical difference between the 2 groups in clinical features and surgical results between groups A and B. All patients with cholesteatoma showed clear and significant imaging characteristics. The tumors were totally removed in 18 patients and subtotally removed in 8 patients. Pain relief was satisfactory in all patients. Surgical complications included transient aseptic meningitis in 2 patients, facial numbness in 2 patients, mild tinnitus in 2 patients, mild and facial weakness in 1 patient. No death, hematoma, or acute hydrocephalus were reported in this series. During the follow-up of 12-80 months, no patient experienced recurrence of pain or tumor.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cholesteatoma of the cerebellopontine angle often presented as trigeminal neuralgia. Magnetic resonance imaging is helpful for early diagnosis according to its distinct signal. Surgical treatment is often the first choice, the neuralgia relief was satisfactory after operation. Microvascular decompression is recommended simultaneously if some offending vessels were founded during the surgical resection of the tumor.

AB OBJECTIVE: In glioma operations, we sought to analyze sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of intra-operative 3-dimensional ultrasound (US) for detecting residual tumor compared with early postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Factors possibly associated with radiologic complete resection were also explored.
   METHODS: One hundred forty-four operations for diffuse supratentorial gliomas were included prospectively in an unselected, population-based, single-institution series. Operating surgeons answered a questionnaire immediately after surgery, stating whether residual tumor was seen with US at the end of resection and rated US image quality (e.g., good, medium, poor). Extent of surgical resection was estimated from preoperative and postoperative MRI.
   RESULTS: Overall specificity was 85% for "no tumor remnant" seen in US images at the end of resection compared with postoperative MRI findings. Sensitivity was 46%, but tumor remnants seen on MRI were usually small (median, 1.05 mL) in operations with false-negative US findings. Specificity was highest in low-grade glioma operations (94%) and lowest in patients who had undergone prior radiotherapy (50%). Smaller tumor volume and superficial location were factors significantly associated with gross total resection in a multivariable logistic regression analysis, whereas good ultrasound image quality did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.061).
   CONCLUSIONS: The specificity of intraoperative US is good, but sensitivity for detecting the last milliliter is low compared with postoperative MRI. Tumor volume and tumor depth are the predictors of achieving gross total resection, although ultrasound image quality was not.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine prevalence of headache in patients with histopathologically verified intracranial tumors scheduled for surgery and assess change in headache 1 and 6 months after surgical resection. Possible tumor-related and patient-related predictors for preoperative headache and early postoperative symptom relief were also explored.
   METHODS: The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer has developed a quality-of-life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) with a brain cancere-specific module, QLQ-BN20, containing 20 questions rating symptoms the past week on an ordinal scale ranging from 1 to 4. Analyses are based on question 4 in this questionnaire.
   RESULTS: In this prospective population-based cohort study of 507 patients, we found that headache is a frequent symptom in patients with intracranial neoplasms. 52% reported some degree of preoperative headache, and the prevalence decreased to 43% and 30% 1 and 6 months postoperatively. 19% and 9% reported postoperative worsening or new headache 1 and 6 months after surgery. Younger age, female gender, and occipital tumor location were significant predictors for both preoperative headache and early postoperative relief. In addition, Karnofsky Performance Status <70 was a predictor for headache relief 1 month after surgery. No independent risk factors for worsening or new headache after surgery were identified.
   CONCLUSIONS: Headache is a common symptom in patients with intracranial tumors, especially in younger and female patients. Many patients experience improvement after surgery, and younger age, female gender, occipital tumor location, and functional dependence were identified as factors associated with early postoperative headache relief.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine risk factors for inpatient seizures and long-term epilepsy in patients receiving coil embolization for aneurysm-associated subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted for patients admitted to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center from 2010 to 2014 for subarachnoid hemorrhage. Only patients with coil embolization were included. Variables such as subdural hematoma, cerebral infarction, postoperative vasospasm, cerebral edema, and mass effect were collected. After discharge, patients were followed up to determine whether epilepsy had developed. The chi(2) test was used to assess univariate associations. Multivariable associations were assessed with a binary logistic regression model.
   RESULTS: The study included 175 patients, of whom 16 (9.1%) of the patients had seizures while they were inpatients. Five out of 73 patients met the criteria for epilepsy at follow-up. None of the patients with epilepsy after discharge had electrographic seizures while hospitalized. Vasospasm (odds ratio [OR] 6.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.81-26.25), and Hunt and Hess grade 5 (OR 26.16, 95% CI 3.95-173.49) were significantly associated with in-hospital seizures in a multivariable analysis. Epileptiform discharges on electroencephalogram (EEG) were significantly associated with mass effect findings on brain imaging (OR 3.5, CI 1.05-11.69).
   CONCLUSION: Hunt and Hess grade 5 and vasospasm are independent risk factors for in-hospital seizures. In addition, mass effect is an independent risk factor for epileptiform discharges on EEG. Patients with these risk factors may benefit from continuous EEG. Our results may indicate that there is no association between electrographic seizures and development of epilepsy.

AB OBJECTIVE: The efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) on dexterity remains controversial despite its recognition as an effective strategy for Parkinson disease. The present study investigated the efficacy of STN-DBS for ameliorating bradykinesia and dexterity compared with dopaminergic medications.
   METHODS: Part III of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale was used for the evaluation of bradykinesia, whereas the Purdue Pegboard Test and the Box and Block test were selected for dexterity.
   RESULTS: Our findings indicate that bradykinesia is significantly improved with both DBS and dopaminergic medication, whereas dexterity is improved only with DBS. Dopaminergic medication did not show a satisfactory efficacy on dexterity, and there was little synergistic effect of dopaminergic medication and STN-DBS for improving dexterity associated with Parkinson disease.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that DBS is potentially more effective than dopaminergic medications for improving dexterity. The disparities in efficacy for bradykinesia and dexterity between DBS and dopaminergic medication hint at the potential mechanisms of STN-DBS. We speculate that DBS follows at least 2 different mechanisms for improving parkinsonian symptoms: 1) the dopaminergic system, primarily for the improvement of bradykinesia and 2) the nondopaminergic system, for the improvement of dexterity. This hypothesis requires further verification and investigation.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the benefits of intraoperative autologous blood transfusion in intracranial procedures and to conserve precious homologous blood due to shortage of donor and associated complications.
   METHODS: This was a prospective study performed at Bansal Hospital, Bhopal. Predetermined autologous blood was collected in a well-labeled bag containing citrate phosphate dextrose adenine solution after induction of general anesthesia. Then appropriate amount of crystalloid solution was transfused in to the body. All collected autologous blood was transfused back to the patient at the end of the surgery or during the surgery if excessive blood loss occurred. Demographic data, hemodynamic changes (mean arterial pressure, heart rate) before and after donation, complications, and any additional homologous blood requirement were noted. Pre- and postoperative hemoglobin and hematocrit values were compared.
   RESULTS: In total, 32 patients were included in this study. In our study, mean age was 48.87 years; male-to-female ratio was 1:1.4. The mean amount of autologous blood collected was 461 mL, and the mean amount of blood loss during surgery was 1048 mL. In our study, there was no statistically significant difference was found in mean arterial pressure and heart rate before and after autologous blood collection (P > 0.05). When we compared pre- and postoperative mean hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, there was a statistically significant difference present (P < 0.05); this was due to the fact that many patients had meningiomas (15 of 32). Additional homologous blood was required only in 25% of cases (8/32). Of 8 patients, 5 were again cases of deep-seated meningiomas. No complications were observed during or after autologous blood collection.
   CONCLUSIONS: Autologous blood transfusion is a safe, effective, and affordable method of blood transfusion in patients undergoing intracranial surgery. Complications associated with homologous blood transfusion can be avoided with autologous blood transfusion.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcome of patients with epidural spinal cord compression from different solid tumors treated with a combined approach, surgery plus radiotherapy (RT), with a follow-up longer than 10 years.
   METHODS: Ninety-seven patients treated between 2002 and 2009 were included. Surgical treatment was performed in patients with good performance status, limited metastatic disease, life expectancy longer than 3 months, and progressive neurologic deficit and/or intractable pain. RT was performed delivering a median total dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Clinical outcome was evaluated using the modified visual analog scale for pain, the Frankel scale for neurologic deficit, and magnetic resonance imaging before treatment, after treatment, and every 3 months thereafter.
   RESULTS: Palliative decompression was performed in 27% of patients, tumor curettage (debulking) was performed in 51%, and total vertebrectomy was performed in 22%, followed by RT in 78% of cases. Pain remission was obtained in 98% of patients, and recovery of neurologic function was obtained in 51%. The median follow-up time was 135 months (range, 96-209 months). The 5-and 10-year local control rates were 82.8% and 82.8%, respectively. The median and 5-and 10-year progression-free survival rates were 12 months, 16.9%, and 11.3%, respectively; the median and 5-and 10-year overall survival rates were 18 months, 21.3%, and 12%, respectively. On univariate and multivariate analysis, factors recorded as conditioning survival were the performance status and the presence of other metastases at the time of vertebral treatment (P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our update confirmed that surgery plus RT is a safe and feasible treatment with limited morbidity. In selected patients with favorable prognostic factors, the combined treatment may significantly impact on survival.

AB OBJECTIVE: Currently, no spinal classification system has achieved universal acceptance. Therefore, it is important to choose a reliable classification within clinical practice. The objective of this study was to determine and compare the intraobserver and interobserver agreement of the Load Sharing Classification (LSC), the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification System (TLICS), and the AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification System.
   METHODS: In this web-based intraobserver and interobserver study (www.spine.hostei.com), plain radiographs and computed tomographic scans of traumatic thoracolumbar fractures (T12-L2) were evaluated. By use of a questionnaire, fractures were classified according to the LSC, the TLICS, and the AOSpine classification. Data were analyzed with SPSS (Version 21, 76 Chicago, Illinois, USA). Intraobserver and interobserver agreement was determined by the Cohen k. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.
   RESULTS: Data from 91 patients were classified twice by 7 board-certified spine surgeons. The intraobserver and interobserver reliability considering the LSC total score was noted as fair (intraobserver/interobserver reliability: k [0.26/0.22). Considering the resulting TLICS total score, a moderate intraobserver agreement (k = 0.41) was noted, whereas the interobserver results presented only fair reliability (k = 0.23). In contrast to the LSC and the TLICS, the AOSpine classification showed substantial agreement considering the fracture type (A; B; C) (intraobserver/interobserver reliability: k = 0.71/0.61) and moderate agreement considering the fracture subtype (e.g., A0; A1;.; B1;.) (intraobserver/interobserver reliability: k = 0.57/0.48).
   CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the reliability of the AOSpine fracture classification is superior to the TLICS and the LSC. Therefore, this classification system could best be applied within clinical practice.

AB BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, few studies have compared complications and surgical outcomes of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) between junior attending surgeons and senior attending surgeons. -
   OBJECTIVES: To compare surgical strategies, complications, and outcomes of posterior corrective surgery for AIS between junior attending surgeons and senior attending surgeons.
   METHODS: According to experience level of operation surgeons, the patients were assigned to 2 groups. Group A was the "junior surgeon" group. Group B was the "senior surgeon" group. The following parameters were compared between the 2 groups: age, sex, diagnosis, hospital of record, surgeon experience level, type of instrumentation, type of screws, estimated blood loss, duration of surgery, length of fusion, correction techniques, main curve correction, and thoracic kyphosis correction.
   RESULTS: A total of 132 patients with AIS were included in group A, whereas 207 were in group B. The translational technique was used more often in group A (P < 0.05). whereas the derotation technique was used more often in group B (P < 0.05). Senior surgeons used more monoaxial screws than junior surgeons (P < 0.05). The junior group had significantly greater estimated blood loss than the senior group (P < 0.05). The senior group had significant better correction rates of severe main curve (>70 degrees) and thoracic kyphosis than the junior group (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Senior attending surgeons out-performed junior surgeons in blood loss control, thoracic kyphosis correction, and correction of severe curves.

AB INTRODUCTION: Clinoid segment aneurysms are cerebral vascular lesions recently described in the neurosurgical literature. They arise from the clinoid segment of the internal carotid artery, which is the segment limited rostrally by the dural carotid ring and caudally, by the carotid-oculomotor membrane. Even although clinoid segment aneurysms represent a common incidental finding in magnetic resonance studies, its prevalence has not been yet reported.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of incidental clinoid segment saccular aneurysms diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging as well as their anatomic architecture and their association with smoking, arterial hypertension, age, and sex of patients.
   METHODS: A total of 500 patients were prospectively studied with magnetic resonance imaging time-of-flight sequence and angioresonance with contrast material, to search for incidental saccular intracranial aneurysms. The site of primary interest was the clinoid segment, but the presence of aneurysms in any other location was determined for comparison. The relation among the presence of clinoid segment aneurysms, demographic factors, and secondary diagnosis of arterial hypertension, smoking, and other vascular/neoplastic cerebral lesions was analyzed.
   RESULTS: We found a global prevalence of incidental aneurysms of 7% (95% confidence interval, 5-9), with a prevalence of clinoid segment aneurysms of 3% (95% confidence interval, 2-4). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed a statistically significant relationship among incidental aneurysms, systemic arterial hypertension (P = 0.000), and smoking (P = 0.004).
   CONCLUSIONS: In the studied population, incidental clinoid segment aneurysms constitute the variety with highest prevalence.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients' recall of their preoperative status is seldom used to assess surgical outcomes because of concerns about inaccuracy and bias. The present study aimed to measure the significance of this recall bias and its repercussion on patients' recollection of their preoperative status.
   METHODS: Patients submitted to surgery due to degenerative spine diseases over a 1-year period (n = 198) were included in this study. Each patient completed the EuroQol Five-Dimensional Questionnaire (including a visual analog scale), Core Outcome Measures Index (COMI) for neck (including neck pain and shoulder/arm pain numeric rating scale [NRS]), COMI back (including back pain and buttock/leg pain NRS), Neck Disability Index, and Oswestry Disability Index preoperatively. At 1 year after surgery, the patients were asked to complete 2 sets of the same questionnaires, one set regarding their postoperative status and the other set regarding their recall of their preoperative status.
   RESULTS: There was poor to moderate agreement between recalled and collected preoperative scores for all patient-reported outcome measures. Patients' recollection of their preoperative status was accurate for patients who underwent cervical spine surgery, but not for those who underwent lumbar spine surgery. Patients satisfied with the outcome after lumbar spine surgery recalled significantly worse scores compared with the actual preoperative scores.
   CONCLUSIONS: Using patients' recall of their preoperative status may lead to overestimation of the effectiveness of surgery, particularly for lumbar spine surgery. The self-assessed effectiveness of surgery interferes with the recollection of baseline status.

AB OBJECTIVE: Medical institutions use quality metrics to track complications seen in hospital admissions. Similarly, morbidity and mortality (M&M) conferences are held to peer review complications. The purpose of this study was to compare the complications identified in a cohort of patients within 30 days of neurosurgical intervention with those captured in a cohort of M&M conferences.
   METHODS: All complications that occurred within 30 days of surgery were obtained for patients admitted to the neurosurgical service between May and September 2013. All patients discussed in M&M conference between August 2012 and February 2015 were included in a second data set. Complications were subdivided into 4 categories and compared between the 2 cohorts.
   RESULTS: A total of 749 postoperative complications were identified, including 52 urinary tract infections, 52 pneumonias, 15 deep vein thromboses, 19 strokes, 75 seizures, 25 wound infections, 6 cardiac arrests, and 162 reoperations. Eighty-five M&M cases were reviewed, identifying 9 strokes, 3 seizures, 8 wound infections, 13 hematomas, 7 intra-operative errors, and 11 postoperative deaths. The M&M cohort showed higher rates of neurologic complications (P < 0.0001) and surgical complications (P < 0.0001). The neurosurgical admission cohort showed higher rates of general medical adverse events (P = 0.0118) and infectious complications (not surgical wound related, P = 0.0002).
   CONCLUSIONS: Both neurosurgical service inpatient complications and complications discussed in M&M provide valuable opportunities for identifying areas in need of quality improvement. As the United States moves toward an outcomes reimbursement model, neurosurgical programs should adjust M&M conferences to reflect both technical operative complications as well as more common complications.

AB OBJECTIVE: The interlaminar window is the most important corridor during both interlaminar approaches to intervertebral discs. The aim of this study was to measure radiologic parameters related to endoscopic and microsurgical interlaminar discectomy.
   METHODS: Measured parameters included lateral recess line (LRL) width, distance between LRL and endplates of upper intervertebral disc, superior and lateral angles of interlaminar window, interlaminar height, and interpedicular distance via optimized coronal oblique projection computed tomography images. Measurements were performed at L2, L3, L4, and L5 levels.
   RESULTS: LRL was found to be 16.3 +/- 3.4 mm, 17.3 +/- 3.3 mm, 21.7 +/- 3.4 mm, and 27.7 +/- 4.0 mm at L2, L3, L4, and L5. The distances between LRL and both upper endplates decreased from L2 to L5. Distance between LRL and upper endplate of same vertebra and between LRL and lower endplate of upper vertebra was measured. Interlaminar window height decreased from L2 to L5 levels (from 14.0 +/- 4.1 mm to 11.1 +/- 2.4 mm).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that width of LRL increases in lower lumbar segments, and height of interlaminar window increases in upper lumbar segments. This study also revealed that intervertebral disc is located cranial to LRL at L2-3, L3-4, and L4-5 levels and is located caudal to LRL at L5-S1 level. The results of this study may help surgical planning in both endoscopic and microscopic interlaminar surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: Chordomas are rare tumors of notochordal origin that are known to be locally aggressive and are often treated with surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiation therapy (RT). The accepted standard of treatment for chordomas of the mobile spine, which includes en-bloc resection with wide margins, cannot be easily applied to the chordomas of the skull base because of their proximity to critical neurovascular structures. We describe our experience with the role of surgery and adjuvant RT in the treatment of chordomas over 16 years.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review on patients with diagnoses of clival chordoma between the years 2000 and 2015 at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. We reviewed presenting symptoms, tumor location and size, extent of resection, complications, recurrence, adjuvant treatment, and follow-up duration.
   RESULTS: A total of 20 patients underwent 32 surgeries. Of the 20 initial surgeries, 80% underwent gross total resection, and 20% had subtotal resection. The mean follow-up time was 60.75 months. Mean tumor volume was 23.07 cm(3). Most common presenting signs and symptoms were headaches (70%), cranial nerve palsies (45%), and diplopia (55%). Diplopia was defined as complaints of double vision without any objective evidence of a cranial nerve palsy. Median time to progression was 57 months, and median overall survival was 136 months. Initial tumor volume and the need for a second dose of RT either as sole or as adjuvant treatment of a recurrence had a statistically significant effect on progression-free survival (P = 0.009, 0.009). None of the factors studied had a statistically significant effect on overall survival.
   CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of chordomas remain challenging and requires multimodal treatment strategies spanning different specialties. Initial tumor size and need for second dose of RT for recurrence appear to play a significant role in progression-free survival. Adjuvant RT after gross total resection may play a role in improved progression-free and overall survival in patients with clival chordomas.

AB OBJECTIVE: High-grade gliomas are associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE). This retrospective study with a parallel cohort design investigated influence of continuing prophylactic anticoagulation after discharge on rate of VTE and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in patients operated on for high-grade glioma.
   METHODS: Consecutive adult patients who underwent subtotal or gross total resection for high-grade glioma at a single institution were included. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association between duration of thromboprophylaxis (dalteparin administered 21 days vs. 0-7 days) and occurrence of VTE and ICH within 21 or 90 days after surgery, corrected for known risk factors.
   RESULTS: Of 301 included patients, 166 received short-term thromboprophylaxis, and 135 received prolonged thromboprophylaxis. In multivariable analysis, prolonged thromboprophylaxis was not significantly associated with occurrence of VTE within 21 days (3.0% vs. 1.2%; P = 0.24) or 90 days (8.9% vs. 4.8%; P = 0.09) after surgery; however, prolonged prophylaxis was associated with occurrence of ICH (5.9% vs. 0.6%; P = 0.03). Additionally, immobility (P = 0.03) and high body mass index (P = 0.02) were associated with occurrence of VTE.
   CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic anticoagulation for 21 days postoperatively was not associated with a decreased rate of VTE compared with thromboprophylaxis until discharge. ICH was more common with prolonged thromboprophylaxis. These results provide insufficient evidence to extend duration of prophylaxis beyond hospitalization. Large-scale randomized prospective studies are needed to clarify safety, efficacy, and optimal timing of postoperative thromboprophylaxis in patients with high-grade glioma.

AB BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to evaluate the change in Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scores at baseline, 3 months, and 12 months postprocedure and correlate with legacy measures.
   METHODS: We analyzed patients in 3 cohorts: lumbar, cervical, and the pooled cohort from our database, 2014-2017. Outcome variables were PROMIS items of pain interference, emotional distress and physical function, EuroQol 5 dimensions, visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index/Neck Disability Index, back, leg/neck and arm pain scales, and Patient Satisfaction Index.
   RESULTS: Patients with lumbar and cervical diseases constituted 55.3% (n = 52) and 44.7% (n = 42) of patients, respectively. There was a significant change in median PROMIS pain interference (65.5 to 57.6), anxiety (56.3 to 48.4), depression (51.2 to 37.1), and physical function (37.2 to 42.6) at baseline and 3 months, respectively. Similarly, change in these scores from baseline to 12 months was significant (n = 48). Compared with change in median Neck Disability Index and Oswestry Disability Index from baseline to 12 months (24.0 to 10.0; P = 0.0004 and 19.0 to 10.0; P < 0.0001), change in median PROMIS physical function score in the same cohort was 38.7 to 45.4 (P = 0.0025) and 37.2 to 41.8 (P < 0.0001), respectively. There was significant correlation between PROMIS pain interference/physical function and the legacy measures at 3 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: PROMIS items correlated with legacy measures at baseline and postsurgery. Patients undergoing spine surgery improved in their patient-reported outcomes from baseline to 3 months after surgery and the gain were maintained at 12 months.

DT Article
DE External ventricular drain infection; External ventricular drain
   placement; External ventricular drain protocol; Meta-analysis
ID QUALITY; GUIDELINES; GRADE
AB BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have examined the impact of initiating an external ventricular drain (EVD) placement and handling protocol on the infection rate dating back to the early 2000s.
   METHODS: We report a quantitative systematic review of the published literature, described our own protocol (including a mandatory checklist), and present our single institution experience. Search terms "external ventricular drain protocol" or "external ventricular drain placement protocol" or "preventing infections in external ventricular drains" or "external ventricular drain infections" were entered into standard search engines in a systematic fashion. Articles were reviewed and graded independently for class of evidence. There were 10 relevant class IV articles and no discrepancies among article ratings (i.e., k = 1). The published evidence was reviewed and evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria.
   RESULTS: Our meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant drop in rates of EVD infection after initiation of the protocol, although the overall quality of the body of evidence according to the GRADE criteria was "very poor". Preimplementation and postimplementation infection rates were collected and analyzed in combination with the results from our literature review. The EVD infection rate in our institution was 12% in the 8 months before protocol initiation (January 2015 to August 2015), and dropped to 0% in the 7 months after initiation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the quality of the literature supporting EVD placement protocols is poor, all published studies show a consistent and substantial benefit, and this effect was recapitulated in our own meta-analysisebased prospective EVD protocol experience.

ID DONATION; DONORS; CANCER
AB OBJECTIVE: Dealing with the empty space after organ removal for transplantation has not been investigated.
   METHODS: From January 28, 2005, to November 21, 2017, 111 organ donors were enrolled in this study. They were divided into 3 groups: no replacement, replaced with paper printed with organ graphics, or replaced with 3-dimensional (3D) printed simulated organs. The organs were removed at different periods. The donor's age, gender, etiology of admission, characteristics, clinical pictures, time interval between admission and date of donation, and time interval between donor coordinator consultations were evaluated.
   RESULTS: A total of 82 men and 29 women with mean age of 43 +/- 15.1 years were enrolled. Overall, 329 organs and 126 corneas were transplanted. The major causes of brain death were traumatic brain injury (44.1%) and cerebrovascular disease (32.4%). Twelve donors initially presented with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Ten patients with solid cancers and 3 with septic shock donated both of their corneas. The mean time interval between donor coordinator and social worker consultation to organ donation was 3 (2-5 days) (median [interquartile range]). Periods I and II averaged 7-8 donors per year. Fourteen donors and 41 organs were replaced with 3D-printed simulated organs at the families' request in 1 year.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to provide a replacement method dealing with the empty space after organ removal. We used 3D-printed simulated organs in addition to providing grief assistance and spiritual support. It also has the potential effect of increasing the organ donation rate.

ID CLINICAL-FEATURES; PINEAL REGION; JUNCTION; OPTIONS; ANATOMY; VEINS
AB BACKGROUND: Falcotentorial meningiomas (FTM) stand out for their rarity, inconsistent definition, and surgical complexity. It is appropriate to deal with them in the context of medial tentorial meningiomas (TMs).
   METHODS: Clinical and radiologic characteristics of medial TMs, comprising the typical features of FTM and TM, along with surgical management and short-term and long-term outcomes, are reported.
   RESULTS: FTM (n = 16) were typically supratentorial, large, edematous tumors that caused mainly headache and hemianopia; TM (n = 12) were infratentorial, smaller not edematous tumors that caused mainly headache and gait ataxia. The most frequent venous pattern was straight sinus infiltration in one third of cases of FTM and occlusion in one half of cases of TM. Total removal (Simpson grade I-II) was obtained in 46.4% of cases and subtotal removal (Simpson grade III-IV) in 53.6%. Suprainfratentorial extension in FTM and incomplete venous invasion in TM were the factors most likely opposing complete removal. The overall acute complications rate was 32.1% (higher for FTM), transient for most cases. Patients with supratentorial meningiomas performed significantly worse preoperatively (Karnofsky Performance Status <= 70 in 75% of cases); patients with infratentorial symptoms/signs recovered worse postoperatively. Stereotactic radiosurgery with subtotal removal was used as adjuvant treatment in 8 cases. Only 2 recurrences, both atypical tumors, occurred at 57.6 months (mean) follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: As a general rule, careful venous management, tailored surgical approach for FTM, and cautious tumor removal for TM can yield good and stable results. Total removal accounts for half the cases in both groups, whereas FTM was associated with worse postoperative complications.

ID POSTERIOR-FOSSA; INFARCTION; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebellar ischemia may lead to space-occupying edema, resulting in potentially fatal complications. Different surgical procedures are available to create space for the swollen ischemic brain; however, the type and timing of surgical treatments remain topics of debate in the literature. Here we report a case series of patients treated with a unilateral craniotomy to perform a cerebellar strokectomy and extensive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage without osteodural posterior fossa decompression.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and radiographic data of 11 patients with posterior fossa ischemia who underwent surgery at one of our institutions. A statistical analysis was performed to identify potential predictive factors for functional outcome.
   RESULTS: The mean patient age was 64.7 years. The involved vascular territory was the Posterior inferior cerebellar artery in 9 patients (82%) and the anterior inferior cerebellar artery/superior cerebellar artery in 2 patients (18%). The mean Glasgow Coma Scale score was 13.6 on admission, but 9.3 immediately before surgery. The surgical procedure was performed in a mean of 36.8 minutes after the radiologic diagnosis of space-occupying edema. Clinical outcome at 6 months was good (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score <= 2) in 9 patients (82%). Surgery-related complications occurred in 2 patients (18%), and these was a single death (9%) not related to the procedure or posterior fossa compression. Matching patients with their mRS outcome evaluation, the sole variable significantly associated with good outcome was age at admission (62.1 vs. 76.5 years; P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral suboccipital craniotomy with strokectomy and extensive CSF drainage may allow for satisfactory decompression of the ischemic posterior fossa with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates, especially in younger patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and radiologic outcome of stand-alone anterolateral lumbar interbody fusion (ALLIF) using self-locked cages in comparison with extended posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) for symptomatic adjacent-segment degeneration (ASD) after posterior lumbar fusion.
   METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 40 symptomatic patients with ASD who were treated with ALLIF (n = 13) or extended PLIF (n = 27) between January 2011 and January 2015. Evaluations were performed preoperatively, at 3, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Clinical outcome measurements included visual analog scale scores for low-back and leg pain, Oswestry Disability Index score for function assessment, Short-Form 36 Questionnaire for quality of life, and modified Macnab criteria for patient satisfaction. Radiologic outcome measurements included fusion rate, cage subsidence, disc height, and lumbar lordosis.
   RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the baseline data for the ALLIF and PLIF groups (P > 0.05). Mean operative time, blood loss, and length of hospital stay were significantly decreased for the ALLIF group (P < 0.05). Postoperatively, low back and leg pain was relieved, function and quality of life were improved in both groups (P < 0.05), whereas disc height and lumbar lordosis were restored (P < 0.05). At 24-month follow-up, fusion was observed in 13 of 13 patients (100%), with 3 of 13 (23.1%) patients developing cage subsidence in the ALLIF group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Stand-alone ALLIF could achieve satisfactory safety and efficacy for the treatment of symptomatic ASD with less trauma and faster recovery, and it may serve as an alternative surgical treatment for symptomatic ASD with appropriate indication.

ID SPONDYLOTIC MYELOPATHY; INJURY; BIOMECHANICS; ANATOMY
AB BACKGROUND: Cervical myelopathy is a complex pathology and dynamic compression of the tethered cervical cord, which may be responsible for clinical symptoms.
   METHODS: Patients with cervical canal stenosis who had magnetic resonance imaging in flexion and extension positions were retrospectively reviewed. All cases were evaluated in Nurick grade. The cervical parameters-cervical cord (CC) angle, cervical lordosis, and spine/cord (S/C) angle ratio-were measured on the magnetic resonance imaging. Mean values of these parameters were compared between nonmyelopathic (Nurick grade 0) and myelopathic groups (Nurick grades 1-5). A multinomial ordinal logistic regression was used to predict outcome for Nurick grade using the CC angle, the cervical lordosis angle, and the S/C angle ratio as independent variables.
   RESULTS: A total of 65 patients (35 men) with the mean age of 58.6 +/- 11.4 years were analyzed. A comparison of means between Nurick grade 0 against each of myelopathic grades 1-5 revealed significant differences only for the S/C angle ratio. A cumulative comparison between nonmyelopathic and myelopathic grades for the S/C angle ratio showed significant difference of 0.29 (1.16 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.45 +/- 0.6, respectively; P < 0.05). Cumulative comparison for the CC angle difference in flexion and extension lordosis did not show substantial differences. The S/C angle ratio was the only significant parameter in the prediction of the Nurick grade with an odds ratio of 2.63 (95% confidence interval 2.11-2.79).
   CONCLUSIONS: A positive correlation between Nurick grade and cervical spine and cord angle mismatch was found.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical characteristics of patients with intracranial cryptococcoma, clinicopathologic findings, and outcomes after surgery.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data were collected from hospital case records, and pathologic confirmation was done by a neuropathologist. Clinical details, imaging features, and treatment modalities were evaluated and correlated with outcomes based on regular follow-up.
   RESULTS: This case series included 5 cases of histology- and culture-proven intracranial cryptococcoma. Three patients (60%) were aged between the 3rd and 5th decades. Three cases were supratentorial in location, and 2 were in the posterior fossa. One patient presented with seizures. Three patients (60%) presented with fever. Three patients (60%) had papilledema, and 4 (80%) had signs of meningeal irritation. Four patients (80%) were immunocompetent. Only 1 patient was immunocompromised. All lesions were peripherally enhancing on computed tomography. Four of 5 patients underwent surgical decompression without any residue. Only 1 patient underwent stereotactic biopsy. All patients received antifungal therapy. One patient who was immunocompromised developed multiorgan failure and died after 2 months after surgery (20%). Of 5 cases, 4 (80%) had a good outcome with a mean follow-up of 5 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cryptococcus gattii is a rarer species implicated in intracranial cryptococcoma that is seen along with the more common Cryptococcus neoformans. Early diagnosis and surgical decompression followed by intravenous amphotericin B therapy for at least 6 weeks and concomitant therapy with fluconazole for prolonged periods may reduce morbidity and mortality.

   Factors Impacting the Survival of Patients Following Implementation of
   the Stupp Protocol

AB BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is a fatal brain cancer with low median and yearly survival rates. Standard of care for treating glioblastoma is gross total resection (GTR) coupled with the Stupp protocol, but various factors influence the interventions undertaken and survival achieved. As health disparities exist in rural areas, survival in these areas needs to be assessed to understand which factors detract from the successes of these standard medical interventions.
   METHODS: We retrospectively determined impact of age at diagnosis, number of lesions, the molecular marker O-6-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT), extent of surgery, and completion of the Stupp protocol on survival in patients treated at West Virginia University Hospitals. We also compared our findings with a preeStupp protocol study done in West Virginia in 1996.
   RESULTS: Age <60 years at diagnosis, having the MGMT gene methylated, having a unifocal tumor, receiving GTR, adhering to the Stupp protocol, and undergoing a treatment course of GTR followed by the Stupp protocol significantly increased survival. Comparison with the 1996 study showed that although overall median survival has not increased, all interventions involving GTR have resulted in a significantly higher survival.
   CONCLUSIONS: We can serve our patient population by offering GTR to all adult patients with glioblastoma when no contraindications exist and ensuring that patients follow the Stupp protocol. After discharge, the Stupp protocol may not be followed or completed for a variety of reasons. In the future, we aim to assess these reasons and analyze other significant interventional and socioeconomic factors that influence survival.

TI Unplanned Intraoperative Extubations in Pediatric Neurosurgery: Analysis
   of Case Series to Increase Patient Safety
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Anesthesiology; Neurosurgery; Never event; Patient safety; Pediatric;
   Unplanned intraoperative extubation
ID CHILDREN; NICU
AB OBJECTIVE: Unplanned intraoperative extubations (UIEs), rare but high-risk events. Unintentional extubations are used as quality improvement metrics in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units, but intraoperative events have received scant attention in the literature. Complexity of patient positioning and proximity of the operative field to anesthesia make neurosurgical procedures unique. UIEs prolong operative time, increase risk of adverse outcomes, including cardiopulmonary collapse, and potentially require additional procedures. Investigating each event is critical to prevention. We aimed to analyze occurrences of UIEs in the pediatric population.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed UIE cases (12/2014-4/2017) in pediatric neurosurgical patients at a metropolitan pediatric Level I trauma center. Data were collected on patient demographics, procedure, operating room events before the event, and patient outcomes.
   RESULTS: Over 27 months, 5 UIEs in pediatric neurosurgical cases occurred, with an event rate of <0.3%. Two occurred in patients <1 year old. Two UIEs occurred in patients undergoing surgery for epilepsy. Root cause analysis identified varied etiologies of UIE: 2 were attributed to endotracheal tube securement, 2 were attributed to lighter anesthesia planes in epilepsy cases with limb movement, and 1 occurred while supinating a prone patient. Postoperative outcomes for these patients were no different from routine cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest an inverse correlation between patient age and UIE, with patient manipulation and anesthesia depth as risk factors. Meticulous attention to securing the endotracheal tube and streamlined communication between the surgical and anesthesia teams are critical for the goal of zero UIE occurrences.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate risk factors for instability in intracranial aneurysms (IAs) using computed tomography angiography (CTA).
   METHODS: A total of 614 consecutive patients diagnosed with 661 IAs between August 2011 and February 2016 were reviewed. Patients and IAs were divided into stable and unstable groups. Along with clinical characteristics, IA characteristics were evaluated by CTA. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent risk factors associated with unstable IAs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed on the final model, and optimal thresholds were obtained.
   RESULTS: Patient age (odds ratio [OR], 0.946), cerebral atherosclerosis (CA; OR, 0.525), and IAs located at the middle cerebral artery (OR, 0.473) or internal carotid artery (OR, 0.512) were negatively correlated with instability, whereas IAs with irregular shape (OR, 2.157), deep depth (OR, 1.557), or large flow angle (FA; OR, 1.015) were more likely to be unstable. ROC analysis revealed threshold values of age, depth, and FA of 59.5 years, 4.25 mm, and 87.8 degrees, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The stability of IAs is significantly affected by several factors, including patient age and the presence of CA. IA shape and location also have an impact on the stability of IAs. Growth into an irregular shape, with a deep depth, and a large FA are risk factors for a change in IAs from stable to unstable.

ID CELLULAR-TELEPHONE USE; BRAIN-TUMORS; CANCERS; BIAS
AB BACKGROUND: Wireless phone use has been increasing rapidly and is associated with the risk of glioma. Many studies have been conducted on this association without reaching agreement. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the possible association between wireless phone use and risk of adult glioma.
   METHODS: Eligible studies were identified by searching PubMed and Embase up to July 2017. Random-effects or fixed-effects model was used to combine the results depending on the heterogeneity of the analysis. Publication bias was evaluated using Begg's funnel plot and Egger's regression asymmetry test. Subgroup analysis was performed to evaluate possible influence of these variables.
   RESULTS: Ten studies on the association of wireless phone use and risk of glioma were included. The combined odds ratio of adult gliomas associated with ever use of wireless phones was 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92-1.16) with high heterogeneity (I-2 = 54.2%, P = 0.013). In subgroup analyses, no significant association was found between tumor location in the temporal lobe and adult glioma risk, with odds ratios of 1.26 (95% CI, 0.87-1.84), 0.93 (95% CI, 0.69-1.24), and 1.61 (95% CI, 0.78-3.33). A significant association with risk of glioma was found in long-term users (>= 10 years) with odds ratio of 1.33 (95% CI, 1.05-1.67).
   CONCLUSIONS: Ever use of wireless phones was not significantly associated with risk of adult glioma, but there could be increased risk in long-term users.

AB BACKGROUND: Intraoperative neurologic monitoring (IONM) has become an essential component for decreasing the incidence of spinal cord injury during spine surgeries. Many high-risk surgical maneuvers that result in significant IONM alerts have not been reported systematically. Our objective was to thoroughly summarize some common high-risk surgical points associated with IONM alerts in various spine surgeries.
   METHODS: Between November 2010 and April 2017, 62 patients with true-positive IONM alerts from 3139 spine surgeries were enrolled. Transcranial motor evoked potentials, somatosensory evoked potentials, and free-run electromyography were used for IONM. All 62 patients were identified as true-positive IONM cases.
   RESULTS: Of 3139 patients, 101 demonstrated significant IONM changes-62 true-positive cases, 14 false-positive cases, and 25 indeterminate IONM results. IONM alerts most often occurred in thoracic screw placement (n = 10, 16.1%), osteotomy (n = 22, 35.5%), correction (n = 19, 30.6%), and spinal cord decompression (n = 11, 17.8%). Appropriate timely measures are indicated in response to IONM alerts during high-risk surgical maneuvers. Ten (10/62, 16.1%) patients showed permanent postoperative neurologic deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: IONM alerts are often associated with some specific high-risk surgical maneuvers. Careful and timely observation is crucial.

AB BACKGROUND: Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a 3-dimensional (3D) disease that causes cervical myelopathy. The conventional 2-dimensional (2D) measurement of OPLL has limitations in estimating cord compression and myelopathy. In this study, we attempted to use 3D computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure the 3D occupying ratio of OPLL and investigate its significance in the assessment of spinal cord myelopathy.
   METHODS: Three-dimensional CT and MRI were performed in 50 patients with cervical OPLL at a neutral position before surgery. MRI was done to determine the extent of spinal cord compression. The CT data were saved in DICOM format and analyzed using Mimics 17.0. Then a 3D model of OPLL was semiautomatically segmented at a specific threshold. The following data were measured: diameter of the spinal canal, thickness of the OPLL, and 3D volume of the OPLL and spinal canal. The Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score was used to assess the cervical spinal cord function.
   RESULTS: Pearson correlation analysis showed that both the occupying ratio and the 3D occupying ratio were significantly and negatively correlated with the JOA score. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that only the 3D occupying ratio showed a significantly negative correlation with the JOA score, whereas age, sex, and the occupying ratio were insignificantly associated with the JOA score.
   CONCLUSIONS: The 3D occupying ratio of OPLL is a reliable indicator for assessing the severity of spinal cord myelopathy. MRI provides more details about cord compression, making the measurement more accurate and objective.

AB BACKGROUND: Occipital condyle fractures (OCFs) have traditionally been described based on anatomic characteristics; however, recent literature has proposed management based on biomechanical stability and neural element compression. The treatment of biomechanically stable fractures varies between observation and cervical immobilization. Before determining the best management approach, an understanding of concomitant cervical spine fractures in the presence of OCFs is important. The primary aim of this pilot study was to determine the rate of occurrence of biomechanically significant cervical spine fractures with OCFs.
   METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of 13,363 patients presenting to a level 1 trauma center between 2013 and 2017 with a diagnosis of OCF.
   RESULTS: Forty-six patients presented with OCFs, with an average Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12 on presentation and an average Injury Severity Score of 23. The average patient age was 42.1 years, and 4 patients had bilateral OCFs. Approximately 30% of these patients had associated intracranial injuries and 59% had an associated cervical spine injury. The overall rate of associated potentially biomechanically significant cervical spine fracture was 43.5%. Treatment of OCFs included collar immobilization (83%) and observation (17%). The average duration of follow-up was 3.37 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study characterizes cervical spine fractures that occur concomitantly with OCFs. The results indicate that more than one-half of patients with OCFs do not have biomechanically significant fractures elsewhere in the cervical spine. This subset of patients will be the cohort for a prospective study to assess whether collar immobilization is necessary.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patterns, predictors, and outcomes of postprocedure delayed hemorrhage (PPDH) following flow diversion therapy for intracranial aneurysm treatment.
   METHODS: From 2012 to 2016, 50 patients with 52 aneurysms were treated with the Pipeline embolization device. Device placement was performed as a standalone therapy or with adjunctive coil embolization. Patients underwent dual antiplatelet therapy for 6 months after treatment. Medical comorbidities; aneurysm traits; and treatment factors, including platelet function testing, were studied. Statistical analysis was performed using cross-tabulation.
   RESULTS: Six PPDHs (12%) occurred 2-16 days (mean 6.8 days) after Pipeline placement, manifesting as 1 of 2 distinct patterns: convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH) (n = 4) or lobar intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) (n = 2). All PPDHs occurred ipsilateral to the device; 1 IPH occurred ipsilateral but in a different arterial territory. PPDH occurred in both treated anterior communicating artery aneurysms. Cases of PPDH demonstrated on average lower P2Y12 reaction unit values at the time of treatment. Platelet function testing at the time of hemorrhage was consistently hypertherapeutic. Patients with cSAH had only minimal worsening of modified Rankin Scale score at the time of discharge, whereas the 2 patients with IPH experienced significant deterioration.
   CONCLUSIONS: PPDH is a poorly understood complication following flow diversion therapy that can result in significant morbidity. In our experience, nonaneurysmal cSAH does not result in poor clinical outcomes, whereas IPH leads to long-term deficits or death. As previously suggested, there appears to be a correlation between low P2Y12 reaction unit values and PPDH.

AB OBJECTIVE: Adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery is associated with a high rate of perioperative blood transfusions, and it is important to understand the risk factors for perioperative blood transfusions to implement strategies to reduce transfusions. The aim of this study was to identify independent risk factors of perioperative blood transfusions in patients undergoing surgery for ASD.
   METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2010 to 2014. Adult patients undergoing surgery for ASD were separated into 2 cohorts based on whether they received a perioperative blood transfusion. Univariate and multivariate regression models were used to identify risk factors for blood transfusion.
   RESULTS: In our cohort of 5805 patients, 27.1% received a blood transfusion. Multivariate regression analysis showed that patient-specific risk factors were age 65 years or older (odds ratio [OR], 1.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49-2.03; P < 0.001), American Society of Anesthesiologists classification of 3 or greater (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.01-1.37; P = 0.033), cardiac comorbidity (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.03-1.41; P = 0.018) and bleeding disorder (OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.10-3.66; P = 0.023). Surgery-specific risk factors were a posterior approach (OR, 4.25; 95% CI, 3.46-5.22; P < 0.001), pelvic fixation (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.36-2.20; P < 0.001), and osteotomy (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.71-2.51; P < 0.001). Longer operative time was also a risk factor with a duration-dependent effect on the odds of blood transfusion.
   CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of patient-and surgery-specific risk factors for perioperative blood transfusion is important to identify patients who are at high risk and to implement strategies to minimize intraoperative blood loss and decrease healthcare costs.

AB OBJECTIVE: Several survival prediction models for patients with glioblastoma have been proposed, but none is widely used. This study aims to identify the predictors of overall survival (OS) and to conduct an independent comparative analysis of 5 prediction models.
   METHODS: Multi-institutional data from 159 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma who received adjuvant temozolomide concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) were collected. OS was assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression and adjusted for known prognostic factors. An independent CCRT patient cohort was used to externally validate the 1) RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) model, 2) Yang RPA model, and 3) Wee RPA model, Chai-chana model, and the RTOG nomogram model. The predictive accuracy for each model at 12-month survival was determined by concordance indices. Calibration plots were performed to ascertain model prediction precision.
   RESULTS: The median OS for patients who received CCRT was 19.0 months compared with 12.7 months for those who did not (P < 0.001). Independent predictors were: 1) subventricular zone II tumors (hazard ratio [HR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-2.5); 2) methylguanine methyltransferase promoter methylation (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.2-0.6); and 3) extent of resection of >85% (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9). For 12-month OS prediction, the RTOG nomogram model was superior to the RPA models with a c-index of 0.70. Calibration plots for 12-month survival showed that none of the models was precise, but the RTOG nomogram performed relatively better.
   CONCLUSIONS: The RTOG nomogram best predicted 12-month OS. Methylguanine methyltransferase promoter methylation status, subventricular zone tumor location, and volumetric extent of resection should be considered when constructing prediction models.

AB OBJECTIVE: Cervical myelopathy is a common, acquired cause of spinal cord dysfunction in older patients. It is postulated that a hypoxic or ischemic environment secondary to chronic spinal cord compression plays an important role in the pathogenesis of myelopathy. This study aims to use dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) to assess the altered blood flow to the spinal cord in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). To our knowledge, this study is the first to use DECT in identifying comprised anterior spinal artery blood flow in patients with CSM.
   METHODS: Fifty patients with single disc level CSM and 10 volunteers without CSM underwent DECT of the cervical spine to analyze and compare the ASA. The neurologic status of each patient was evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at 5 days, 1 month, and 6 months using the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score. All the patients with CSM underwent single-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, and at postoperative day 5, each patient underwent repeated DECT. The anterior spinal artery before and after surgery was compared in patients with CSM. The blood flow in terms of iodine content at a specific region of interest was measured in the axial CT of the volunteers group and in the preoperative and postoperative axial CT of patients with CSM. Correlations between change in blood flow and clinical improvement at each follow-up point were analyzed statistically.
   RESULTS: Iodine content (100 mg/mL) was 14.2800 +/- 1.89527 at the C3/C4 disc level, 14.8280 +/- 1.83820 at the C4/C5 disc level, and 15.5000 +/- 2.41048 at the C5/C6 level. In patients with CSM, the preoperative iodine content (100 mg/mL) measured was 10.2621 +/- 2.37396 in C3/C4 disclevel compression, 12.1438 +/- 1.63447 in C4/C5 disc-level compression, and 14.0620 +/- 2.44390 in C5/C6 disc-level compression. Postoperative iodine content (100 mg/mL) measurement changed to 13.78 +/- 2.77 for the C3/C4 disc level, 14.16 +/- 1.90 for the C4/C5 disc level, and 15.14 +/- 2.62 for the C5/C6 disc level. The JOA score was 13.650 preoperatively, 14.010 at 5 days postoperatively, 14.630 at 1 month postoperatively, and 15.000 at 6 months postoperatively. The 1-and 6-month correlation ratios between the JOA and change in blood flow were statistically significant, with an r value of 0.746 (P < 0.05) and 0.760 (P < 0.05), respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study provided evidence for the benefit of DECT as a radiographic tool for identifying the compromised cervical anterior spinal artery in patients with CSM. We believe that DECT is the one of the best radiographic tools available to provide an objective screening tool to detect compromised blood flow in patients with CSM.

AB BACKGROUND: Prognostic markers are important for neurosurgeons to evaluate the indications for aggressive surgical management. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the number of fractured calvarial bones could predict the outcome in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) after early craniotomy.
   METHODS: TBI patients who underwent early craniotomy were reviewed. The number of fractured calvarial bones was recorded by referring to preoperative computed tomographic (CT) images. Accordingly, patients were assigned to no calvarial fracture group, single calvarial fracture group, and multiple calvarial fractures group. Good outcome was defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale scores of 4 and 5 at discharge. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the effect of calvarial fracture on outcome. A receiver operating characteristic curve was generated for the final model.
   RESULTS: In all, a total of 141 patients were enrolled. Patients with no calvarial fracture had a significantly lower rate of good outcome (12.5%) than did those with a single calvarial fracture (62.2%, P < 0.001) and those with multiple calvarial fractures (48.6%, P = 0.005). Binary logistic regression showed that the number of fractured calvarial bones was an independent imaging marker for predicting outcome (P = 0.003) after adjustment for age, Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission, and decompressive craniectomy. The area under the curve of the final model was 0.863.
   CONCLUSIONS: The number of fractured calvarial bones is an independent predictor of outcome in TBI patients after early craniotomy. No calvarial facture is associated with poor outcome in these patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Although C1-C2 pedicle screw techniques have been extensively reported in pediatric series, reports on their use have examined only small series with short follow-up periods. The aim of this study was to report pediatric patients with atlantoaxial rotatory dislocation treated with these techniques with a minimum 5-year follow-up.
   METHODS: Retrospective review was performed of 27 pediatric patients with atlantoaxial rotatory dislocation who underwent C1-C2 pedicle screw fixation between 2004 and 2012. Clinical and radiographic outcomes were collected and compared with a control group.
   RESULTS: Follow-up period was 60-142 months (mean 84 months). Torticollis was completely corrected postoperatively in all but 1 patient. All patients experienced significant pain relief and improvement in range of motion, and 6 patients with neurologic deficits experienced significant improvement postoperatively. Both atlantodental interval and space available for the cord were significantly improved compared with preoperative values. At final follow-up, curvature was lordotic in 20 cases and straight in 7 cases. Compared with the control group, range of motion of the patient group was not significantly different in any direction except in flexion and rotation. Mean anteroposterior diameters of the spinal canal at C1 and C2 levels were not significantly different from the control group.
   CONCLUSIONS: C1-C2 pedicle screw techniques are safe and effective for treatment of atlantoaxial rotatory dislocation and result in no obvious limitation on growth in older children.

AB BACKGROUND: Endoscopic endonasal clipping of intracranial aneurysms may use microsurgical techniques as an alternative to the transcranial approach. Here we report a series of patients who underwent microsurgical clipping of anterior circulation aneurysms via an endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA).
   METHODS: This retrospective chart review included all the patients who underwent standard binostril EEA for aneurysm clipping. Surgical outcomes and complications are noted. The rationality and limitations of this procedure are discussed.
   RESULTS: Seven patients with 12 aneurysms of the anterior circulation underwent EEA for clipping. These 12 aneurysms consisted of 5 anterior communicating artery (AComA) aneurysms, 4 paraclinoid aneurysms, 1 ophthalmic artery aneurysm, and 2 aneurysm located in the cavernous segment of internal carotid artery (ICA). Nine of the 12 aneurysms were successfully clipped. One giant paraclinoid aneurysm could not be clipped during operation and was coiled in second endovascular stage. The 2 aneurysms located in the cavernous segment of ICA were not clipped intentionally in a single-stage procedure, after weighing the surgical benefit against the difficulty of surgical exposure and feasibility. The proximal control of ICA was achieved in all cases. There was no death, no cerebrospinal fluid leak, or other complications. All patients recovered completely.
   CONCLUSIONS: EEA can provide direct access for microsurgical clipping of strictly selected anterior circulation aneurysms. All the principles of cerebrovascular surgery must be followed. These procedures require a long learning curve. Only teams with adequate experience in microvascular and endoscopic skull base surgeries should attempt this approach for treating aneurysms.

   TOMOGRAPHY; ULTRASOUND; GUIDANCE
AB BACKGROUND: Transpedicular screw fixation has a biomechanical advantage of improving fusion rates. In posterior thoracolumbar immobilization, a large number of screws cause perforation to the pedicle or vertebral body. Radiography and computed tomography (CT) have been used to minimize this complication. The ability of ultrasound (US) to detect the pedicle breach during placement of the screw is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of US for detecting breaches.
   METHODS: A B-type transducer was used to scan 216 titanium pins inserted into cadaveric pedicles. Of the pins, 180 were intentionally misplaced: 90 pins breached the lateral wall of the pedicle, and 90 pins pierced the anterior wall of the vertebral body. US images were reviewed by 3 examiners blinded to both the procedure and the corresponding CT findings. The perforation length of pins was measured by 3 radiologists on CT images.
   RESULTS: CT data were divided into 2 groups. In group 1 (perforation length 0-2 mm), sensitivity of US for detecting lateral wall and anterior wall perforation was 80.95% and 76.42%, respectively; in group 2 (perforation length 2-4 mm), sensitivity was 94.79% and 91.93%. Overall sensitivity of US to detect lateral wall and anterior wall perforation was 89.63% and 86.30%, respectively. The sensitivity of US for detecting perforation was greater in the lateral wall than in the anterior wall. Sensitivity of US was greater in group 2 than group 1 for both lateral and anterior perforation.
   CONCLUSIONS: US can be applied to detect perforation of <= 4 mm. Use of US may improve patient safety.

AB BACKGROUND: Management of large or giant fusiform middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms represents a significant challenge.
   OBJECTIVE: To describe the authors' experience in the treatment of large or giant fusiform MCA aneurysm by using various surgical techniques.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a database of aneurysms treated at our division between 2015 and 2017.
   RESULTS: Overall, 20 patients (11 males, 9 females) were identified, with a mean age of 40.7 years (range, 13-65 years; median, 43 years). Six patients (30%) had ruptured aneurysms and 14 (70%) had unruptured aneurysms. The mean aneurysm size was 19 mm (range, 10-35 mm). The aneurysms involved the prebifurcation in 5 cases, bifurcation in 4 cases, and postbifurcation in 11 cases. The aneurysms were treated by clip reconstruction (n=5), clip wrapping (n=1), proximal occlusion or trapping (n=4), and bypass revascularization (n=10). Bypasses included 7 low-flow superficial temporal arterye-MCA bypasses, 2 high-flow extracranial-intracranial bypasses, and 1 intracranial-intracranial bypass (reanastomosis). Bypass patency was 90%. Nineteen aneurysms (95%) were completely obliterated, and no rehemorrhage occurred during follow-up. There was no procedural-related mortality. Clinical outcomes were good (modified Rankin Scale score <= 2) in 18 of 20 patients (90%) at the last follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment strategy for large or giant fusiform MCA aneurysms should be determined on an individual basis, based on aneurysm morphology, location, size, and clinical status. Favorable outcomes can be achieved by various surgical techniques, including clip reconstruction, wrap clipping, aneurysm trapping, aneurysm excision followed by reanastomosis, and partial trapping with bypass revascularization.

AB OBJECTIVE: Anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF), in which a ventral constriction is resected, can decompress myelopathy and is considered the optimal treatment for ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) up to now. However, its disadvantages are incomplete decompression, high surgery- and implant-related complication rates, and extremely surgical technique demanding. Our object was to introduce anterior controllable antedisplacement fusion (ACAF), a new surgical technique to treat OPLL, and compare it with ACCF.
   METHODS: ACAF was performed on 34 patients with spinal stenosis with myelopathy due to severe (occupying rate >= 50%) OPLL. Pre- and postoperatively, we measured decompression width and spinal canal area on cross-sectional computed tomography and morphology and anteroposterior diameter of the spinal cord at the most severely affected segment on cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging and cross-sectional computed tomography. Japanese Orthopedic Association scoring was used to evaluate neurologic status. The ACAF group and a control group of 36 patients with ACCF were compared.
   RESULTS: Postoperatively, decompression width (17.9 +/- 1.0 vs. 15.1 +/- 0.8 mm; P < 0.01), spinal canal area (150.4 +/- 31.6 vs. 127.0 +/- 27.0 mm(2); P < 0.01), and anteroposterior spinal cord diameter (5.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 5.0 +/- 1.1 mm; P < 0.05) were significantly greater in the ACAF group. At 6 months, mean Japanese Orthopedic Association score was significantly better in the ACAF group (15.4 +/- 0.9 vs. 14.5 +/- 2.5 points; P = 0.04).
   CONCLUSIONS: ACAF, providing adequate decompression of the spinal cord and good outcomes, is a well choice in the treatment of spinal stenosis due to severe OPLL.

AB OBJECTIVE: Endovascular disconnection of pial arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) is challenging. The aim of this study was to evaluate safety and effectiveness of transarterial balloon-assisted glue embolization for treating pial AVFs.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical and imaging records of 8 patients with high-flow pial AVFs treated by transarterial balloon-assisted glue embolization from August 2011 to July 2017.
   RESULTS: There were 6 male patients and 2 female patients with age range of 1-48 years. Presentation was seizure in 4 patients, headache in 3 patients, and subarachnoid hemorrhage in 1 patient. Seven lesions were located in the supratentorial region. All lesions were single-channel fistulas associated with venous varix. Five lesions had a single feeder, and 3 had multiple feeders. All lesions were obliterated completely in single-session embolization with no procedure-related complications. Two patients experienced symptomatic thrombosis of drainage venous system after embolization. One patient fully recovered on discharge, and another patient fully recovered after 8 months. With a mean clinical follow-up of 12.1 months, all patients were free of pretreatment symptoms. Follow-up angiograms revealed durable occlusion of fistulas.
   CONCLUSIONS: Transarterial balloon-assisted glue embolization is a feasible and effective option for treatment of high-flow pial AVFs.

ID PERITUMORAL EDEMA; EXPRESSION; AQUAPORIN-4; RECEPTORS; VEINS
AB BACKGROUND: Parasagittal meningioma (PSM) has a high incidence of peritumoral edema and unclear pathogenesis. The venous compression theory has been proposed as a pathomechanism; however, this is controversial, and the various edema patterns have not been recognized.
   OBJECTIVE: We sought to establish the relationship between venous circulation status with different edema patterns in PSM and the neurologic outcomes of these different patterns.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 60 consecutive patients who underwent surgical treatment for PSM. Patients were divided into 3 groups: no edema, poor brain-tumor interface-related edema (PIRE), and strong brain-tumor interface-related edema (SIRE). Single-blinded observers scored venous circulation for each patient based on the degree of superior sagittal sinus (SSS) occlusion, the number of involved cortical veins, and venous collateral grade. PIRE and SIRE were analyzed using multivariate analysis. Finally, we evaluated the functional independence and mobility score for every patient.
   RESULTS: The PIRE group showed the highest rate of cerebral venous decompensation at 75% (n = 15) compared with 38.5% (n = 5) in the SIRE group and 22.2% (n = 6) in the no-edema group. We observed a significant correlation between venous decompensation and PIRE generation on multivariate analysis (P = 0.029). The PIRE group showed the worst immediate functional status, and the SIRE group had the best improvement in complete dependence rate (23%) at late evaluation.
   CONCLUSIONS: The generation of PIRE, but not SIRE, may depend on venous decompensation in PSM. PIRE generation is predictive of worse neurologic outcome. Future studies into the pathogenesis of peritumoral edema should distinguish the different edema patterns.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine outcomes of Pipeline embolization device (PED) use for treatment of intracranial aneurysms outside of U.S. Food and Drug Administratione-approved indications.
   METHODS: Data from patients with aneurysms treated with off-label use of PED were pooled from 4 centers in a retrospective multicenter cohort study. Primary endpoints were decline in modified Rankin Scale score by at least 1 point and angiographic aneurysm occlusion at follow-up.
   RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 109 patients. Mean aneurysm size was 8.4 +/- 7.4 mm, 20.2% of aneurysms were located in the posterior circulation, and 11.9% of aneurysms were ruptured. The most common reasons for off-label use were aneurysm size (50.5%), aneurysm location (25.7%), and both size and location (10.1%). Mean follow-up was 9 months. Complete occlusion was achieved in 82.5% of cases at last angiographic follow-up. Modified Rankin Scale score decline was found in 18.8% of cases. On univariate analysis, age, aneurysm size, aneurysm morphology, aneurysm location, reason for off-label use, and rupture status were not associated with clinical decline or aneurysm occlusion on angiography. On multivariate analysis, treatment of a ruptured aneurysm with PED was found to be an independent predictor of postoperative decline in modified Rankin Scale score, and size as the only reason for off-label PED use was found to be an independent predictor of complete occlusion on final angiography.
   CONCLUSIONS: Off-label use of PED has a reasonable risk-to-benefit profile for appropriately selected aneurysms. Posterior circulation location and fusiform morphology do not appear to be associated with worse clinical or angiographic outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore molecular markers of radiosensitivity and prognostic factors in patients with clival chordomas.
   METHODS: Retrospective review was performed of 35 patients. Mean follow-up interval was 66.37 months (range, 29-106 months). Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect expression levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD).
   RESULTS: Total resection was achieved in 12 cases, subtotal resection was achieved in 12 cases, and partial resection was achieved in 11 cases. Radiation-sensitive group comprised 17 cases, and radiation-resistant (RR) group comprised 18 cases. Five-year progressionfree survival (PFS) rates in total resection and nontotal resection groups were 46.3% and 10.1%, respectively (P = 0.005). Mean H-scores of ERK in radiation-resistant and radiation-sensitive groups were 110.38 and 82.98, respectively (P = 0.043). Mean H-scores of HPGD in radiationresistant and radiation-sensitive groups were 178.62 and 203.47, respectively (P = 0.031). Mean PFS in low ERK expression group (58.61 months) was significantly longer than mean PFS in high ERK expression group (24.94 months) (P = 0.022). Mean PFS in high HPGD expression group (39.54 months) was significantly longer than mean PFS in low HPGD expression group (9.5 months) (P = 0.013).
   CONCLUSIONS: Radical resection with protection of important structures is the most effective treatment of clival chordomas. High HPGD expression and low ERK expression were associated with radiation sensitivity and better prognosis. HPGD and ERK can be used as biomarkers to predict prognosis and guide treatment.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the presence of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) is independently associated with intracranial aneurysm rupture and to identify the time interval of CMB-related intracranial aneurysm rupture.
   METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1847 patients with unruptured and ruptured intracranial aneurysms from January 2010 to November 2017. Clinical records and imaging, including T2-weighted gradient-recalled echo sequence magnetic resonance imaging that identified the presence of CMBs preoperatively, were evaluated. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were done to determine which parameters were independent factors for aneurysm rupture. The time interval of CMB-related intracranial aneurysm rupture was also evaluated.
   RESULTS: CMBs confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging were present in 142 patients (142/1847; 7.7%). Of 142 patients with CMBs, 56 patients (including 17 ruptured aneurysms) who received endovascular treatment and another 86 consecutive patients who did not receive embolization or surgery for various reasons were followed for 3-49 months. The incidence of CMB-related intracranial aneurysm rupture was 27.9% (24/86) during the follow-up period. The time interval of CMB-related intracranial aneurysm rupture was 3-27 months (median 9.5 months). Multivariate analyses showed CMBs were significantly correlated with intracranial aneurysm rupture (odds ratio = 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.4; P = 0.010).
   CONCLUSIONS: CMBs were independently associated with intracranial aneurysm rupture. Patients with CMBs have a 60% increased risk of aneurysm rupture compared with patients without CMBs.

AB OBJECTIVE: Hematoma expansion is related to unfavorable prognosis in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The black hole sign is a novel marker on non-contrast computed tomography for predicting hematoma expansion. However, its predictive values are different in previous studies. Thus, this meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the predictive significance of the black hole sign for hematoma expansion in ICH.
   METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed. Original researches on the association between the black hole sign and hematoma expansion in ICH were included. Sensitivity and specificity were pooled to assess the predictive accuracy. Summary receiver operating characteristics curve (SROC) was developed. Deeks' funnel plot asymmetry test was used to assess the publication bias.
   RESULTS: Five studies with a total of 1495 patients were included in this study. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the black hole sign for predicting hematoma expansion were 0.30 and 0.91, respectively. The area under the curve was 0.78 in SROC curve. There was no significant publication bias.
   CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows that the black hole sign is a helpful imaging marker for predicting hematoma expansion in ICH. Although the black hole sign has a relatively low sensitivity, its specificity is relatively high.

   CLASSIFICATION; PHENOTYPES; PNEUMONIA; CRITERIA
AB Background: Anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) autoantibodies have been identified as myositis-specific autoantibodies that are often associated with clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (CADM) and a poor prognosis due to rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RP-ILD) in East Asian patients. Besides anti-MDA5 autoantibodies, patients with CADM may have myositis-associated autoantibodies (MAAs), which characterize other connective tissue diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome. However, the clinical significance of the coexistence of anti-MDA5 autoantibodies and MAAs in patients with CADM remains unclear.
   Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 24 patients with CADM who had anti-MDA5 autoantibodies. Their clinical phenotypes including laboratory test results, high-resolution lung computed tomography data, response to therapy, and prognosis were compared between those who were positive and negative for MAAs, such as antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), anti-SSA, and anti-SSB antibodies.
   Results: Among 24 patients, 9 (37.5%) additionally had at least one of the MAAs examined in this study: 1 patient was positive for ANA, 5 for anti-CCP, 5 for either anti-SSA or anti-SSB, 1 for anti-cardiolipin, and 1 for anti-Scl-70. Although all anti-MDA5-positive patients with CADM had ILD, the MAA-positive patients showed a lower risk of developing RP-ILD (p=0.03), a more favorable response to combination therapy of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, and a lower mortality rate than patients with no MAAs (p=0.03).
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that anti-MDA5-positive patients with CADM who also have MAAs have a better prognosis than those without MAAs; thus, anti-MDA5 autoantibodies by themselves may not be strong predictors of worse clinical outcomes in patients with CADM. Coexistent MAAs could be biomarkers for a favorable prognosis in anti-MDA5-positive patients with CADM.

AB Background: The clinical phenotypes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are related to various outcomes. We investigated the risk of acute respiratory events in patients with bronchiectasis-COPD overlap syndrome (BCOS) in Taiwan.
   Methods: We included 3955 patients who received diagnoses of COPD and bronchiectasis from 2000 to 2007 from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database in the BCOS cohort. In the comparison cohort, we included patients with COPD but without bronchiectasis at a ratio of 4: 1, frequency matched by age, sex, and index year with each patient with BCOS. We followed both cohorts for 5 years to investigate the incidence and risk of acute respiratory events in the BCOS cohort relative to the comparison cohort, the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined using Poisson regression models.
   Results: The BCOS cohort experienced more episodes of acute respiratory events than did the comparison cohort (16.4 vs 5.52 per 100 person-y). After adjustment for potential covariates, the BCOS cohort had a 2.20-fold higher risk of pneumonia (adjusted IRR=2.20, 95% CI=2.06-2.34), a 3.88-fold higher risk of acute exacerbation (adjusted IRR=3.88,95% CI=3.64-4.13), a 1.74-fold higher risk of acute respiratory failure (adjusted IRR=1.74,95% CI=1.47-2.06), and a 1.99-fold higher risk of cardiopulmonary arrest (adjusted IRR=1.99,95% CI=1.81-2.20) than did the comparison cohort.
   Conclusion: The patients with BCOS had a higher risk of acute respiratory events than did COPD patients without bronchiectasis.

AB Background: Pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis (PIG) is a rare paediatric interstitial lung disease of unknown cause. The diagnosis can only be made by lung biopsy. Less than 100 cases have been reported. Clinical features, treatment and outcomes have rarely been assessed systematically in decent cohorts of patients.
   Methods: In this retrospective multicentre study, the clinical presentation, radiologic findings, pattern of lung biopsy, extrapulmonary comorbidities, treatment and outcome of eleven children with PIG were collected systematically.
   Results: 10/11 children presented with respiratory distress immediatly after birth and 8/11 needed invasive ventilation. In 8/11 children extrapulmonary comorbidities were present, congenital heart defects being the most common. 7/11 children received systemic glucocorticoids and of these four showed a clear favorable response. During a median follow-up of 3.0 years (range 0.42-12.0) one child died, while 10 patients improved. Chest CT-scans showed ground-glass opacities (7/10), consolidations (6/10), linear opacities (5/10) and mosaic attenuation (4/10) without uniform pattern. Besides interstitial thickening related to undifferentiated glycogen positive mesenchymal cells all tissue samples showed growth abnormalities with reduced alveolarization.
   Conclusions: PIG is associated with alveolar growth abnormalities and has to be considered in all newborns with unexplained respiratory distress. Apparent treatment benefit of glucocorticosteroids needs to be evaluated systematically.

   PREVALENCE; MANAGEMENT
AB Background: Maternal prenatal smoking has adverse effects on the growing fetus including those of respiratory nature. Although postnatal smoke exposure is a risk factor for respiratory infections, the effects of prenatal smoking independent of postnatal smoke exposure are less established. We hypothesized that both maternal prenatal smoking, and postnatal smoke exposure are risk factors for severe bronchiolitis during infancy.
   Methods: We performed a case-control study of 1353 children born between 1996 and 2011 at a single teaching hospital. Cases were admitted to the same hospital for bronchiolitis during infancy. Maternal prenatal smoking was collected from birth records. Postnatal smoke exposure was collected from review of electronic health records. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the independent associations of the two smoking variables with severe bronchiolitis.
   Results: 6% of cases were exposed to maternal prenatal smoking, compared with 4% of controls (P=0.10). Postnatal smoke exposure was present in the households of 17% of cases compared with 3% of controls (P < 0.001). In a multivariable model with both smoking variables and adjustment for 10 covariates, maternal prenatal smoking was not a significant risk factor for severe bronchiolitis (adjusted OR=1.02, 95% CI 0.56-1.84). By contrast, postnatal smoke exposure was associated with > 300% increased odds (adjusted OR 4.19, 95% CI 2.51-6.98).
   Conclusions: Although maternal prenatal smoking has many known adverse effects, it was not associated with increased odds of severe bronchiolitis in either unadjusted or multivariable analyses. Postnatal smoke exposure was a consistently strong risk factor. Our findings support ongoing efforts to decrease infant exposure to ambient smoke.

AB Objectives: Pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently colonizes the lungs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Mucoid conversion is a hallmark of chronic P. aeruginosa infection, which is mediated by mucA gene mutations. The aim of this study is to identify predictive factors for mortality and the influence of mucA gene mutation in COPD patients with P. aeruginosa pneumonia.
   Methods: This study assessed 75 COPD patients with P. aeruginosa pneumonia at two university hospitals. The clinical and laboratory data were collected, and the P. aeruginosa isolates analyzed for the presence of mucA gene mutations.
   Results: MucA gene mutation of P. aeruginosa was an independent predictor of mortality (odds ratio [OR] 10.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.53-70.90, p=0.017). In addition, the APACHE II score and C-reactive protein/Albumin (CA) ratio were independent predictive factors for mortality (OR 1.25, 95% CI: 1.07-1.46, p=0.004; and OR 1.06, 95% CI: 1.02-1.10, p=0.003, respectively). The optimal cutoff value of CA ratio for the greatest sensitivity and specificity was calculated as 31.27 (sensitivity, 85.7%; specificity, 80.3%).
   Conclusions: CA ratio and mucA gene mutation of P. aeruginosa could be used as predictors to identify poor prognosis in COPD patients with P. aeruginosa pneumonia.

TI Within and between day repeatability of the incremental shuttle walking
   test in patients with thoracic cancer
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Exercise; Incremental shuttle walking test; Lung cancer; Mesothelioma;
   Non-small cell lung cancer; Small cell lung cancer
AB Background: Breathlessness is common in patients with thoracic cancer but difficult to manage. The Incremental Shuttle Walking Test (ISWT) can help assess new treatments, but its repeatability has not been described in this group.
   Aim: To examine within and between day repeatability of the ISWT in this setting.
   Methods: Patients with incurable thoracic cancer were recruited from outpatient clinics at a University Hospital. Two ISWTs were completed one hour apart on two consecutive days, with the first test for familiarization purposes only. Repeatability of distance walked was examined using Bland and Altman plots and assessed as the single determination (within subject) standard deviation of the difference between tests and its 95% range.
   Results: Forty-one patients participated and completed all tests. Mean (SD) distance walked was 333 (134), 349 (129) and 353 (130) m over the three tests, with the mean difference significantly different from zero between days (16 m, 95% CI 8-24 m, P=0.043) but not within days (5 m, 95% CI -2 to 12 m, P=0.47). Within and between day single determination SD and 95% ranges were 30 (-31 to 91) m and 36 (-37 to 109) m respectively.
   Conclusions: These data help inform the design of studies making use of the ISWT and the interpretation of their findings.

AB Background: Despite advances in asthma management, exacerbations constitute a significant health economic burden.
   Objective: To observe the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine formula entitled PingchuanYiqi (PCYQ) granule, on acute asthma and to explore its possible mechanism.
   Materials and methods: This proof-of-concept study consisted of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with acute asthma (n=300). Participants with acute mild-to-moderate asthma recruited from seven centers in China were randomly assigned to receive PCYQ or placebo. The primary outcomes were PEF (L/min) and total asthma symptom scores. Furthermore, a panel of cytokines including serum IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1 beta, IL-17A, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, CRP, CCL-5, IP-10, and PGD(2) levels was detected using ELISA.
   Results: The PCYQ (n=139) significantly improved the morning PEF on day 4 (349.73 +/- 93.92 vs. 313.56 +/- 92.91 L/min, P=0.004) and day 7 (360.42 +/- 94.39 vs. 329.52 +/- 95.97 L/min, P=0.023), and the evening PEF on day 4 (352.65 +/- 95.47 vs. 320.58 +/- 95.30 L/min, P=0.012) and day 7 (360.42 +/- 94.39 vs. 336.86 +/- 95.59 L/min, P=0.029) in comparison with the placebo (n=143). The PCYQ also improved the clinical symptoms scores and reduced the puffs of short-acting beta(2)-agonist (all P < 0.05). Furthermore, the PCYQ statistically reduced IL-5, IL-8, IL-1 beta and PGD(2) in serum.
   Conclusion: The PCYQ as the Chinese herbal medicine formula significantly improves lung function and symptoms of acute asthma, and reduces SABA dosage possibly via decrease of inflammatory biomarkers such as IL-5, IL-8, IL-1 beta and PGD(2).

TI Airway Interleukin-33 and type 2 cytokines in adult patients with acute
   asthma
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Interleukin-33; Acute asthma; Exacerbation; Type 2 cytokines; Adults
ID RECEPTOR ST2; INFLAMMATION; INNATE; IL-33
AB Background: Several animal studies, and one inoculation study in adult asthmatics have shown that interleukin33 (IL-33) is a major contributor to type-2 inflammation in acute asthma. However, the link between IL-33 and type-2 inflammation has not been shown in naturally occurring asthma exacerbations.
   Objectives: To determine if airway IL-33 is associated with type-2 inflammation measured by type-2 cytokines, FeNO and sputum eosinophils in patients presenting to the Emergency Department with an asthma exacerbations.
   Methods: Adult patients hospitalized due to acute asthma were enrolled. Upper airways were sampled with nasal swabs and lower airways with induced sputum. Cytokines were measured at protein level using a Luminex (R) assay and mRNA expression level using droplet-digital-PCR. Airway sampling was repeated four weeks after exacerbation.
   Results: At the time of exacerbation, upper airway IL-33 correlated with upper airway IL-5 and IL-13 (R=0.84, p < 0.01 and R=0.76, p < 0.01, respectively) and with lower airway IL-13 (R=0.49, p=0.03). Similar associations were observed for mRNA expression. Lower airway IL-33 positively correlated with lower airway IL-13 (R=0.84, p < 0.01). IL-13 and IL-33 were positively correlated with FeNO, and IL-5 with eosinophils. The association between IL-33 and type-2 cytokines were still present four weeks after exacerbation.
   Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate that airway IL-33 is associated with type-2 cytokines in naturally occurring asthma exacerbations in adults, providing in vivo evidence supporting that IL-33 may be driving type-2 inflammation in acute asthma. Thus supporting IL-33 as a potential future drug target due to its role, upstream in the immunological cascade.

TI Nationwide use of theophylline among adults-A 20-year Danish drug
   utilisation study
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID ASTHMA; THERAPY
AB Background: Theophylline, a dimethylxanthine, has been used the last 100 years to treat airway disease. Although it is one of the most widely prescribed medicines to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) throughout the years, the utilisation patterns are not well-described.
   Methods: Using the Danish Register of Medicinal Products Statistics, we identified adults above 18 years redeeming one or more prescriptions of theophylline between 1997 up to 2017, with a 2-year run-in period from 1995 to 1997. Using descriptive statistics, we reported the development in prevalence, incidence, and a measure of treatment duration (proportion of patients covered).
   Results: In total, 55,636 individuals redeemed 1,066,475 prescriptions of theophylline, 30,619 women (55%) and 25,017 men (45%). The prevalence decreased from 401 per 100,000 individuals in 1997 to 26 per 100,000 individuals in 2016. The incidence rate decreased throughout the entire study period (105 per 100,000 personyears in 1997 to 5 per 100,000 person-years in 2016). In total, 52% were still current users three months after theophylline initiation, 33%, 27%, and 23% were current users after 6 months, one year, and two years.
   Conclusions: Although newer and more efficient medicines to treat asthma and COPD has been developed, theophylline is still prescribed and used in 2016, but the incidence and prevalence have decreased markedly since 1997.

AB Background: Low physical activity (PA) is associated with adverse health outcomes independent of airflow limitation in COPD. Self-reported assessments are often limited to global estimates of PA and may not be directly translatable to patients' goals and motivations. We developed a task-oriented PA checklist and examined its performance relative to pedometer-assessed daily step count in two COPD cohorts.
   Methods: Task-oriented daily physical activity (DPA) was assessed in two COPD cohorts using either interviewer-administered recall questionnaire (DPA-R, Cohort 1, n = 109) or a self-administered diary-format daily checklist (DPA-C, Cohort 2, n = 175). Daily step count was measured in both cohorts using the Omron HJ-720 ITC pedometer. Univariate associations between individual DPA items and [a] cross-sectional and [b] longitudinal change (Cohort 1) in daily step count were assessed using a Pearson's correlation. Composite scores comprised of individual DPA items with univariate association p-values < 0.1 were tested for association with daily step count using multivariate models.
   Results: Tasks associated with average daily step count in both cohorts included putting on shoes, showering, washing hair, walking for exercise, the frequency of walks > 10 min, and walking on an incline (Pearson's rho range = 0.14-0.43). A composite score of these 6 DPA items demonstrated significant associations with baseline average daily step count in both cohorts (rho = 0.5 & 0.47, Cohorts 1 & 2, respectively) and longitudinal change in daily step count (rho = 0.46, Cohort 1).
   Conclusions: Self-reported task-oriented assessments complement direct monitoring and have potential clinical utility in exercise counseling to increase PA among COPD patients.

AB Introduction: Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC) has become a popular option for tissue diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD), however reports vary regarding the safety of this procedure. Herein, we evaluate the safety of transbronchial cryobiopsy in hospitalized patients, comparing adverse events to outpatient procedures.
   Methods and measurements: This is a single center, retrospective chart review of all TBLC performed for suspected ILD between November 2013 and March 2017. Biopsies were performed by a board certified interventional pulmonologist or interventional pulmonology fellow using a two-scope technique.
   Results: One hundred fifty-nine cryobiopsies were performed for the diagnosis of ILD. Rates of adverse events are as follows: pneumothorax 11%, persistent air leak 1.3%, moderate-severe bleeding 3.8%, ICU transfer within 48 h 3.1%, and all cause 30-day mortality 1.9%. No deaths were attributed to the procedure. Comparing adverse events between hospitalized patients and outpatients, rates of pneumothorax were 24% vs 9.9%, persistent air leak 5.9% vs 0.7%, ICU transfer 12% vs 2.1%, and 30-day mortality 5.9% vs 1.4%. However, no differences were statistically significant.
   Conclusion: Practitioners should recognize that while cryobiopsies are a high-yield, safe, and cost-effective alternative to surgical lung biopsy, not all procedures carry the same risk profiles. Hospitalized patients may have a greater propensity for pneumothorax, persistent air leak, transfer to the ICU, and 30-day mortality.

   SAMPLE
AB Objective: Selective stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve has proven to be an effective therapy for patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The aim of the study is to investigate the efficacy of selective upper airway stimulation (sUAS) in older adults.
   Methods: All consecutive patients older than 64 years and who received an implant for sUAS were enrolled. As a control group, an equal number of patients younger than 65 years with matched apnea hypopnea index (AHI) and body-mass-index (BMI) were selected. Treatment outcome data were collected including daytime sleepiness as well as demographics with co-morbidities, BMI, adverse events and adherence to therapy.
   Results: 62 patients were included. Both the control and study group did not differ significantly for AHI, BMI, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) (28.7-28.4/h; 30.1 to 28.4 kg/m(2); 14.6 to 12.0 points); but co-morbidities were significantly higher in the study group. Our data showed no significant difference between the outcomes of study and control group for AHI, Oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and ESS (6.0-6.0/h; 7.9 to 5.5/h; 5.0 to 7.0 points). Serious adverse events did not occur in both groups and surgical implantation time did not differ.
   Conclusion: sUAS leads to significant reductions of AHI, ODI and ESS in older patients. Despite higher age and more co-morbidities, surgical implantation time was not affected. Older patients showed higher usage of sUAS. Advanced age seems not to be a limiting factor for treatment outcomes of sUAS, thus indication for this treatment can also be applied to older people.

TI Health-related quality of life in Canadians with asthma: A case-control
   study using census data

DE Quality of life (QOL); Health-related quality of life (HRQoL); Asthma;
   Health utilities index mark 3 (HUI3); Single-attribute utility (SAU);

ID INHALED CORTICOSTEROIDS; QUESTIONNAIRE; POPULATION; VALIDITY
AB Background: Asthma is a common medical condition that impacts the lives of many Canadians; yet the healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL) in persons with asthma relative to the general population (GP) is poorly studied. In this study, data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 2013 was used to quantify and compare the HRQoL of the asthmatic population (AP) and the GP.
   Methods: A representative survey sample of Canadians was taken from the CCHS to compare the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) scores, a generic HRQoL measure, between the AP (n = 572) and the GP (n = 6518). The HUI3 multi-attribute utility (MAU) and the single-attribute utility (SAU) scores between the two sample groups were studied. The CCHS 2013 dataset was explored as the primary analysis, while the 2012 dataset was used as the confirmatory analysis to verify the consistency of the results.
   Results: Clinically important difference was found in the MAU score between the AP and GP (p < 0.001, Effect size = 0.30). MANOVA on the eight SAU scores with post-hoc test revealed that the AP had a lower mean score of vision (p < 0.001, Effect size = 0.36) and pain/disconfort (p < 0.001, Effect size = 0.29). Those findings were consistent with the CCHS 2012 dataset result.
   Conclusions: These results provided evidence that in Canada, having asthma significantly worsens asthma patients' overall HRQoL and imposes significant impacts on the patients' vision and pain/discomfort. Therefore, there is room for improvement in the currently available asthma therapies so patients could achieve better HRQoL; particular focus should be given to the pain/discomfort and vision health domains.

   NITRIC-OXIDE; HYPERTENSION; OUTCOMES; INFANTS; BIRTH
AB Aim: Ex-premature school children show mild-to-moderate airway obstruction and decreased CO diffusing capacity. Multiple breath nitrogen washout (N2MBW) and NO diffusing capacity (DLNO) measurements may provide new insight into long-term pulmonary and vascular impairment in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).
   Methods: We examined a randomly selected group of 70 ex-premature children (gestational age < 28 weeks or birth weight < 1500 g; 42 with and 28 without BPD) and 38 term-born healthy controls of 8-13 years of age. Subjects performed N2MBW (lung clearance index, LCI; Sacin, and Scond), DLNO (membrane related diffusing capacity, Dm and pulmonary capillary volume, Vc), Fractional exhaled NO, CO diffusing capacity, conventional spirometry (FEV1, FVC, FEF25-75) and plethysmography (RV, TLC). Respiratory symptoms were assessed by questionnaire.
   Results: Compared to healthy controls, the BPD group had higher z-scores for lung clearance index (P = 0.003), Sacin (P = 0.005), lower CO diffusing capacity (P = 0.025), DLNO (P = 0.022), DLNO/VA z-scores (P = 0.025) and a significant larger proportion had respiratory complaints. Amongst ex-premature children, the BPD group did not differ from the non-BPD group except for a decreased Dm (P = 0.023). Ex-premature with BPD showed predominantly airway obstruction (FEV1/FVC; P < 0.0001), signs of hyperinflation (RV/TLC-ratio; P = 0.028), and 25% had a positive bronchodilator response (> 12% in FEV1).
   Conclusion: Ex-premature school children exhibited relatively mild but significant long-term respiratory symptoms and pulmonary peripheral impairment judged by N2MBW and DLNO measurements along with well-known airway obstruction. Larger longitudinal studies are needed to assess the clinical use of these advanced methods of assessing ventilation inhomogeneity and DLNO.

AB Objectives: Only few studies have addressed the prognostic impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), although both diseases are frequent and smoking is a shared risk factor. The objectives of the present study were to investigate the burden of COPD among RA patients and the subsequent mortality.
   Methods: We included patients who had a first-time diagnosis of RA in the Danish National Patient Registry between 2004 and 2016. RA patients with COPD were identified and matched with RA patients without COPD for year of birth, gender, and age at RA diagnosis. Mortality risks were assessed using Kaplan-Meier mortality curves. Adjusted hazard rate ratios (aHRRs) for death were estimated using Cox regression models.
   Results: The study population included 31,333 individuals with RA. 3254 of those (10.4%) had a diagnosis of COPD and were matched to 9706 RA patients without COPD. The mortality risks in RA patients with COPD and RA patients without COPD were 4.5% and 1.5% within 2-6 months (aHRR = 3.0, CI 2.3-3.9), and 59.3% and 39.8% within 0.5-10 years (aHRR = 2.1, CI 1.9-2.1).
   Conclusion: Mortality was significantly increased among RA patients with COPD. The relative mortality risk remained significantly increased throughout the course of follow up.

AB Background: Lung fibrosis is attributed to derangements in extracellular matrix remodeling, a process driven by collagen turnover. We examined the association of two collagen biomarkers, carboxy-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I (ICTP) and amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP), with subclinical interstitial lung disease (ILD) in adults.
   Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 3244 participants age 45-84 years in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Serum ICTP and PIIINP levels were measured at baseline by radioimmunoassay. Subclinical ILD was defined as high attenuation areas (HAA)in the lung fields on baseline cardiac CT scans. Interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) were measured in 1082 full-lung CT scans at 9.5 years median follow-up. We used generalized linear models to examine the associations of collagen biomarkers with HAA and ILA.
   Results: Median (IQR) for ICTP was 3.2 mu g/L (2.6-3.9 mu g/L) and for PIIINP was 5.3 mu g/L (4.5-6.2 mu g/L). In fully adjusted models, each SD increment in ICTP was associated with a 1.3% increment in HAA (95% CI 0.2-2.4%, p = 0.02) and each SD increment in PIIINP was associated with a 0.96% increment in HAA (95% CI 0.06-1.9%, p = 0.04). There was no association between ICTP or PIIINP and ILA. There was no evidence of effect modification by gender, race, smoking status or eGFR.
   Conclusions: Higher levels of collagen biomarkers are associated with greater HAA independent of gender, race and smoking status. This suggests that extracellular matrix remodeling may accompany subclinical ILD prior to the onset of clinically evident disease.

AB Background: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has a potential complication of bacteremia. The objective of this study was to define the clinical outcomes of patients with CAP and bacteremia treated with and without a macrolide.
   Materials and methods: Secondary analysis of the Community-Acquired Pneumonia Organization database of hospitalized patients with CAP. Patients with a positive blood culture were categorized based on the presence or absence of a macrolide in their initial antimicrobial regimen, and severity of their CAP. Outcomes included inhospital all-cause mortality, 30-day mortality, length of stay, and time to clinical stability.
   Results: Among 549 patients with CAP and bacteremia, 247 (45%) were treated with a macrolide and 302 (55%) were not. The primary pathogen was Streptococcus pneumoniae (74%). Poisson regression with robust error variance models were used to compare the adjusted effects of each study group on the outcomes. The unadjusted 30-day mortality was 18.4% in the macrolide group, and 29.6% in the non-macrolide group (adjusted relative risk (aRR)0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI)0.50-1.33; P = 0.41). Unadjusted in-hospital all-cause mortality was 7.3% in the macrolide group, and 18.9% in the non-macrolide group (aRR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30-0.98; P = 0.043). Length of stay and time to clinical stability were not significantly different.
   Conclusions: In-hospital mortality, but not 30-day mortality, was significantly better in the macrolide group. Our data support the use of a macrolide in hospitalized patients with CAP and bacteraemia.

TI The utility of drug reaction assessment trials for inhaled therapies in

LA English

   Pulmonary function testing
ID CYSTIC-FIBROSIS; TOBRAMYCIN; SAFETY; SPUTUM
AB Background: Current guidelines recommend a Drug Reaction Assessment (DRA) before beginning inhaled therapies to assess for bronchoconstriction and tolerability. There is limited evidence to support this recommendation.
   Methods: In this study we aimed to establish the predictors of successful DRAs in different patient groups using a cohort of all DRAs performed in adults between 2011 and 2016 at the Royal Brompton Hospital. Spirometry, age, gender, height, and underlying lung disease were recorded. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to ascertain variables associated with successful DRAs.
   Results: There were 1492 DRA trials using hypertonic saline (32%), antimicrobials (63%), or rhDNase (5%). The majority of patients (94%, n = 1408) passed the DRA. Mean FEV1% predicted was 58.03 (SD 23.36). Female sex, type of inhaled product, and FEV1% predicted were established as significant predictors for DRA success. An FEV1% predicted > 55% was associated with greater probability of DRA success (Odds Ratio [OR]: 2.96 (1.80,4.86) p < 0.0001). Those receiving dry powder, inhaled antibiotics were more likely to pass the DRA compared to nebulised antibiotics (OR: 3.99 (1.38,11.51) p = 0.01)).
   Conclusion: This study classifies distinct patient groups with varying baseline risks which can be used to predict tolerability when adding an inhaled product to their management plan. Some "low risk" patients may in future be able to self-assess their tolerability for inhaled therapies at home to avoid unneeded hospital monitoring.

AB Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is very a common, with great morbidity and mortality, disease. Since the beginning of the disease cannot be detected with precision and by using only FEV1 to monitor the evolution of the disease, the Natural History of COPD is rather obscure and sometimes controversial.
   Therefore, the terms EARLY COPD and MILD COPD have been used indistinguishably in the medical literature.
   In this review we discuss the two terms trying to clarify some of the definition issues, starting with a synopsis of the Naturel History of the disease.
   We recommend to use the term EARLY COPD for the pre-clinical stage of the disease (stage 0) and the term MILD COPD when the diagnosis is confirmed by spirometry and FEV1 is above 80% predicted. However, COPD is a complex disease and spirometric evaluation alone (MILD COPD, stage I), cannot fully describe the clinical status of the patient.
   We conclude that biomarkers to detect the starting point and been able to follow the natural history of the disease more accurately, beyond FEV, are urgently needed.

AB Cyanobacteria produce many biologically active metabolites synthesized via nonribosomal synthetic pathways such as cyclic microcystins (MCs) and linear aeruginosins (Aers). The present study aimed to investigate the effects of different MC variants and the newly isolated aerugenosin Aer-865 on macrophages, which represent one of the key effector cells within the innate immune responses. Specifically, our study included RAW 264.7 macrophage activation associated with production of cytotoxic and cytostatic nitric oxide (NO) as well as pro-inflammatory mediators like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). From the compounds investigated, commonly occurring MC variants (-RR,-YR) and Aer-865 had no significant effects within the non-cytotoxic concentrations tested, i.e. 0.001-1 mu M for MCs and 0.1-50 mu M for Aer-865. In contrast to known immunoactive MC-LR, the negligible immunomodulatory potential of tested MC congeners could be related to their differences in structure. The knowledge of MC structure-specific activities contributes to the understanding of complex toxicity of different MC variants and most importantly their mixtures. This study is one of the first study that evaluate the effect of larger set of cyanobacterial peptides on macrophages and compare their immunomodulatory potential. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Temporary passive immunity such as serotherapy against venoms requires the full knowledge of all venom's components. Here, four venoms from Moroccan common yellow scorpions belonging to Buthus occitanus, subspecies tunetanus, paris, malhommei, and mardochei, all collected in four different restricted areas, were analysed in deep. They were fractionated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and their molecular masse profile determined by off-line MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Characterisation of their main components was achieved by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using specific antisera against the major lethal scorpion toxins identified so far, i.e. voltage-gated sodium channels (Na-v) modulators alpha- and beta-toxins, as well as diverse potassium channel pore blocker toxins. For fractions with identical RP-HPLC retention times, we observe that their relative quantities show large differences. Moreover, identical masses present simultaneously in the four venoms are infrequent. ELISAs show that the majority of the RP-HPLC compounds cross-react with the antiserum against the "alpha-like" toxin Bot 1, which has been previously identified in the Algerian Buthus occitanus tunetanus venom. Moreover, minor fractions were recognised by the antiserum against the highly lethal "classical" alpha-toxin of reference AaH II from the Androctonus australis venom. As such, our results bring new sights for further improving scorpion venom serotherapy in Morocco. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) plays an essential role in the early stages of respiratory tract colonization by Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough. Once secreted, CyaA invades eukaryotic cells, leading to cell death. The cell intoxication process involves a unique mechanism of translocation of the CyaA catalytic domain directly across the plasma membrane of the target cell. Herein, we review our recent results describing how calcium is involved in several steps of this intoxication process. In conditions mimicking the low calcium environment of the crowded bacterial cytosol, we show that the C-terminal, calcium-binding Repeat-in-ToXin (RTX) domain of CyaA, RD, is an extended, intrinsically disordered polypeptide chain with a significant level of local, secondary structure elements, appropriately sized for transport through the narrow channel of the secretion system. Upon secretion, the high calcium concentration in the extracellular milieu induces the refolding of RD, which likely acts as a scaffold to favor the refolding of the upstream domains of the full-length protein. Due to the presence of hydrophobic regions, CyaA is prone to aggregate into multimeric forms in vitro, in the absence of a chaotropic agent. We have recently defined the experimental conditions required for CyaA folding, comprising both calcium binding and molecular confinement. These parameters are critical for CyaA folding into a stable, monomeric and functional form. The monomeric, calcium-loaded (holo) toxin exhibits efficient liposome permeabilization and hemolytic activities in vitro, even in a fully calcium-free environment. By contrast, the toxin requires sub-millimolar calcium concentrations in solution to translocate its catalytic domain across the plasma membrane, indicating that free calcium in solution is actively involved in the CyaA toxin translocation process. Overall, this data demonstrates the remarkable adaptation of bacterial RTX toxins to the diversity of calcium concentrations it is exposed to in the successive environments encountered in the course of the intoxication process.

AB Endotoxins and exotoxins are among the most potent bacterial inducers of cytokines. During infectious processes, the production of inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), gamma interferon (IFN gamma) and chemokines orchestrates the anti-infectious innate immune response. However, an overzealous production, leading up to a cytokine storm, can be deleterious and contributes to mortality consecutive to sepsis or toxic shock syndrome. Endotoxins of Gram-negative bacteria (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) are particularly inflammatory because they generate auto-amplificatory loops after activation of monocytes/macrophages. LPS and numerous pore-forming exotoxins also activate the inflammasome, the molecular platform that allows the release of mature IL-1 beta and IL-18. Among exotoxins, some behave as superantigens, and as such activate the release of cytokines by T-lymphocytes. In most cases, pre-exposure to exotoxins enhances the cytokine production induced by LPS and its lethality, whereas pre-exposure to endotoxin usually results in tolerance. In this review we recall the various steps, which, from the very early discovery of pyrogenicity induced by bacterial products, ended to the discovery of the endogenous pyrogen. Furthermore, we compare the specific characteristics of endotoxins and exotoxins in their capacity to induce inflammatory cytokines. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Clostridium difficile and Clostridium sordellii produce related potent toxins (C. difficile toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), C. sordellii lethal toxin (TcsL) and hemorrhagic toxin (TcsH)) which belong to the large clostridial glucosylating toxin (LCGT) family. TcsL is the main C. sordellii toxin as most of toxigenic C sordellii strains only synthesize this toxin. Intestinal colonization by C. difficile subsequently to unbalanced microbiota is accompanied by release of toxins which induce local tissue destruction and severe inflammatory response. TcdA and TcdB inactivate Rho-GTPases. Notably inactivation of RhoA results in the stimulation of the pyrin/ASC inflammasome, which is one of the main signaling pathways used by these toxins to trigger the inflammatory response. In contrast, TcsL induces an anti-inflammatory effect, mainly by inactivating Ras proteins which results in blockage of the cell cycle and killing of immune cells. The absence or moderate local inflammatory response allows C. sordellii spreading in deep tissues, production of toxin which is released in the general circulation and causes a toxic shock syndrome. The toxin mechanisms of pro-versus anti-inflammatory responses are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB ExoY is one of four well-characterized Pseudomonas aeruginosa type 3 secretion system (T3SS) effectors. It is a nucleotidyl cyclase toxin that is inactive inside the bacteria, but becomes potently activated once it is delivered into the eukaryotic target cells. Recently, filamentous actin was identified as the eukaryotic cofactor that stimulates specifically ExoY enzymatic activity by several orders of magnitude. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the biochemistry of nucleotidyl cyclase activity of ExoY and its regulation by interaction with filamentous actin. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A new Gaussian mixture model (GMM) has been developed for better representations of both atomic models and electron microscopy 3D density maps. The standard GMM algorithm employs an EM algorithm to determine the parameters. It accepted a set of 3D points with weights, corresponding to voxel or atomic centers. Although the standard algorithm worked reasonably well; however, it had three problems. First, it ignored the size (voxel width or atomic radius) of the input, and thus it could lead to a GMM with a smaller spread than the input. Second, the algorithm had a singularity problem, as it sometimes stopped the iterative procedure due to a Gaussian function with almost zero variance. Third, a map with a large number of voxels required a long computation time for conversion to a GMM. To solve these problems, we have introduced a Gaussian-input GMM algorithm, which considers the input atoms or voxels as a set of Gaussian functions. The standard EM algorithm of GMM was extended to optimize the new GMM. The new GMM has identical radius of gyration to the input, and does not suddenly stop due to the singularity problem. For fast computation, we have introduced a downsampled Gaussian functions (DSG) by merging neighboring voxels into an anisotropic Gaussian function. It provides a GMM with thousands of Gaussian functions in a short computation time. We also have introduced a DSG-input GMM: the Gaussian-input GMM with the DSG as the input. This new algorithm is much faster than the standard algorithm.

AB The Calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) family is a group of peptide hormones, which consists of IAPP, calcitonin, adrenomedullin, intermedin, alpha CGRP and beta CGRP. IAPP and calcitonin have been extensively associated with the formation of amyloid fibrils, causing Type 2 Diabetes and Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma, respectively. In contrast, the potential amyloidogenic properties of alpha CGRP still remain unexplored, although experimental trials have indicated its presence in deposits, associated with the aforementioned disorders. Therefore, in this work, we investigated the amyloidogenic profile of alpha CGRP, a 37-residue-long peptide hormone, utilizing both biophysical experimental techniques and Molecular Dynamics simulations. These efforts unravel a novel amyloidogenic member of the CGRP family and provide insights into the mechanism underlying the alpha CGRP polymerization.

ID PARTICLE CRYOELECTRON MICROSCOPY
AB Extraction of particles from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) micrographs is a crucial step in processing single-particle datasets. Although algorithms have been developed for automatic particle picking, these algorithms generally rely on two-dimensional templates for particle identification, which may exhibit biases that can propagate artifacts through the reconstruction pipeline. Manual picking is viewed as a gold-standard solution for particle selection, but it is too time-consuming to perform on data sets of thousands of images. In recent years, crowdsourcing has proven effective at leveraging the open web to manually curate datasets. In particular, citizen science projects such as Galaxy Zoo have shown the power of appealing to users' scientific interests to process enormous amounts of data. To this end, we explored the possible applications of crowdsourcing in cryo-EM particle picking, presenting a variety of novel experiments including the production of a fully annotated particle set from untrained citizen scientists. We show the possibilities and limitations of crowdsourcing particle selection tasks, and explore further options for crowdsourcing cryo-EM data processing.

AB Titin is a giant protein spanning between the Z- and M-lines of the sarcomere. In the A-band titin is associated with the myosin thick filament. It has been speculated that titin may serve as a blueprint for thick-filament formation due to the super-repeat structure of its A-band domains. Accordingly, titin might provide a template that determines the length and structural periodicity of the thick filament. Here we tested the titin ruler hypothesis by mixing titin and myosin at in situ stoichiometric ratios (300 myosins per 12 titins) in buffers of different ionic strength (KCl concentration range 100-300mM). The topology of the filamentous complexes was investigated with atomic force microscopy. We found that the samples contained distinct, segregated populations of titin molecules and myosin thick filaments. We were unable to identify complexes in which myosin molecules were regularly associated to either mono- or oligomeric titin in either relaxed or stretched states of the titin filaments. Thus, the electrostatically driven self-association is stronger in both myosin and titin than their binding to each other, and it is unlikely that titin functions as a geometrical template for thick-filament formation. However, when allowed to equilibrate configurationally, long myosin thick filaments appeared with titin oligomers attached to their surface. The titin meshwork formed on the thick-filament surface may play a role in controlling thick-filament length by regulating the structural dynamics of myosin molecules and placing a mechanical limit on the filament length.

AB Computational protein design is a set of procedures for computing amino acid sequences that will fold into a specified structure. Rosetta Design, a commonly used software for protein design, allows for the effective identification of sequences compatible with a given backbone structure, while molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can thoroughly sample near-native conformations. We benchmarked a procedure in which Rosetta design is started on MD-derived structural ensembles and showed that such a combined approach generates 20-30% more diverse sequences than currently available methods with only a slight increase in computation time. Importantly, the increase in diversity is achieved without a loss in the quality of the designed sequences assessed by their resemblance to natural sequences. We demonstrate that the MD-based procedure is also applicable to de novo design tasks started from backbone structures without any sequence information. In addition, we implemented a protocol that can be used to assess the stability of designed models and to select the best candidates for experimental validation. In sum our results demonstrate that the MD ensemble-based flexible backbone design can be a viable method for protein design, especially for tasks that require a large pool of diverse sequences.

AB Centrioles are microtubule-based structures that play essential roles in cell division and cilia biogenesis. Cep120 is an important protein for correct centriole formation and mutations in the Cep120 gene cause severe human diseases like Joubert syndrome and complex ciliopathies. Here, we show that Cep120 contains three consecutive C2 domains that are followed by a coiled-coil dimerization domain. Surprisingly, unlike the classical C2 domains, all three Cep120 C2 domains lack calcium- and phospholipid-binding activities. However, biophysical and biochemical assays revealed that the N-terminal Cep120 C2 domain (C2A) binds to both tubulin and microtubules, and promotes microtubule formation. Structural analyses coupled with mutagenesis identified a highly conserved, positively charged residue patch on the surface of Cep120 C2A, which mediates the interaction with tubulin and microtubules. Together, our results establish Cep120 C2A as a unique microtubule-binding domain. They further provide insights into the molecular mechanism of Cep120 during centriole biogenesis.

AB In this study, the deoxygenation of oleic acid under a N-2 atmosphere over metal oxide catalysts is investigated for the production of green diesel hydrocarbons. The molybdenum oxide catalysts with promoters (Ni, Co, and Cu) and varying catalyst loadings (19-34 wt%) on gamma-Al2O3 support are prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method and characterized by XRD, FE-SEM/EDX, TEM, XPS, and N-2 sorption. The catalytic testing is carried out in a batch reactor with various reaction times (3-9 h) and temperatures (300-350 degrees C) under N2 pressure (10 and 40 bar). The NiMo oxide/gamma-Al2O3 exhibits the highest performance with over 80% conversion and good selectivity toward C17 hydrocarbon products. The catalytic performance of the NiMo oxide/gamma-Al2O3 remains stable during 4 reaction cycles. Decarboxylation (DCO2) and decarbonylation (DCO) are observed to be the reaction pathways of the deoxygenation and these reactions are enhanced by increasing reaction temperature and time. Stearic acid and other hydrogenated compounds were produced via the in situ hydrogenation which was proposed as a competitive reaction in the deoxygenation of oleic acid under the N-2 pressure. The DFT calculations confirm that the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions could occur on the MoO3 surface. These processes are responsible for the in situ formation of hydrogen species, leading to the formation of hydrogenated products. Hydroxyl groups on the terminal oxygen sites created by dehydrogenation could contribute to the surface vacancy and further promote the DCO2 or DCO pathway. The molybdenum oxide-based catalysts show a great potential for green diesel production without the use of H-2 feed.

AB In this paper, a technical feasibility study on a parabolic trough concentrator (PTC) system for predicting the captured energy in different orientations and tracking modes has been investigated. Thus, the potential of captured solar radiation by a PTC has been estimated by combining simulations and different mathematical models, atmospheric parameters and optical as well as geometric characteristics of the PTC under climate conditions of Errachidia region in south eastern of Morocco (latitude -31.93 degrees N, longitude -4.53 degrees E, altitude 1039 m). Moreover, simulations study for an annual period was carried out using Matlab and TRNSYS for different orientations and tracking modes for the investigated PTC system. From the simulations result we noticed a higher mean daily PTC thermal efficiency of about 28.2% during summer solstice for a full tracking. However, the thermal efficiency of the PTC remains about 27.5% during spring equinox for full tracking and inclined N-S axis (E-W tracking), while it is around 24.2% for full tracking and polar axis (E-W tracking) and about 22.5% for full tracking during autumn equinox and winter solstice, respectively. These first results may enable to forecast the region potential and the feasibility of the investigated system for various orientations and tracking modes for each annual period. In addition, the simulation results clearly show that the studied region remains a suitable location to install PTC systems.

AB This paper deals with transient modelling of a large-scale salt gradient solar pond (SGSP = 50000 m(2)) located in a semi-arid climate region. Precisely, the pond was exposed to meteorological data of the Agafay site (located 30 km south of Marrakesh-Morocco) covering the period from January 2015 to May 2017. We considered three different heat extraction technics (HET) including the reference one (R-HET) that limits the heat draw to the heat storage zone using horizontal tubes. The other two methods consider an additional heat draw from the intermediate non-convective zone using horizontal (HT-HET) and vertical (VT-HET) tubes. We elaborated a transient mathematical model based on energy balance equations for the pond (including the ground) and the extraction's tubes. This model was solved using a MATLAB code based on the fully implicit finite-difference scheme that has been developed for this purpose. The study focuses on the examination of the thermal performances of the considered SGSP for each of the three heat extraction methods based on energetic and exergetic analysis. The obtained results reveal that the third method of heat extraction (VT-HET) provides higher energy and exergy efficiencies by reducing the total heat losses towards the pond's surroundings and saving exergy from destruction. The amount of energy/exergy extraction improvement recorded is around 22.5%/30% compared to the reference heat extraction technic (R-HET) against an improvement of only 1.7%/0.6% for the HT-HET.

Even though several works in literature consider that it remains constant during the system operation, such parameter tends to assume reduced values over time, thus degrading the power that can be extracted from the PV module. It is directly affected by the shunt resistance and, particularly, by the increase of the series resistance due to aging. Besides, it is also influenced by weather conditions, thus causing the corrosion of the PV module cells, manufacturing errors, and "hot spots". Within this context, this paper analyzes the behavior of the ideality factor as influenced by the series resistance. An analytical expression is also presented, as it is possible to evaluate the behavior of the PV module when the ideality factor is reduced as a direct consequence of the aging process. Simulation and experimental results are presented and thoroughly discussed.

AB The work aims to investigate an effective method of catalytic reforming of tar during biomass high-temperature pyrolysis using rice husk char (RHC) and metal impregnated (Fe, Cu and K) char in a dual-stage reactor. The char and char-supported catalysts exhibited high catalytic performance, in terms of the high tar conversion efficiencies of 77.1% for RHC, 82.7% for K-RHC, 92.6% for Fe-RHC and 90.6% for Cu-RHC at 800 degrees C. Moreover, K-RHC and Cu-RHC catalysts after three cycles still exhibited high activity for tar removal. The catalytic tar conversion by char or char-supported catalysts contributes to improving the yield of syngas, particularly the combustible gases of H-2, CO and CH4, corresponding to the syngas yield increasing from 196.6 mL/g for thermal reforming to 269.6 mL/g for K-RHC, 274.9 mL/g for Cu-RHC and 342.7 mL/g for Fe-RHC at 800 degrees C, respectively. The results from GC-MS analysis illustrated that the addition of char and char-supported catalysts promoted the transformation of larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into lighter tar compounds, leading to an increase in the proportion of single-ring tars. XRD results indicated that the most active phases of the fresh K-RHC, Cu-RHC and Fe-RHC for tar cracking and reforming were KCl, Cu and Fe, respectively. Textural characterization showed the addition of Fe and Cu was in favor of producing highly porous carbon materials and led to the increase in specific surface area and total pore volume.

AB Wind energy conversion system (WECS) is increasingly taking the place to be the most promised renewable source of energy, which obliges researchers to look for effective control with low cost. Thus, this paper proposes to build a suitable controller for speed control loop to reach the maximum power point of the wind turbine under sever conditions and to ensure the stability of the outer voltage regulation loop to meet high range of load variations. In literature, a major defect of the well-used conventional PI controller is the slow response time and the high damping. Nowadays, intelligent controllers have been used to solve the drawbacks of the conventional ones but they demand high speed calculators and expensive cost. Moreover, many solutions proposed the fractional order PI controller (FO-PI) by extending the order of integration from integer to real order. The FO-PI controller presents also some weakness in steady state caused by the approximation methods. The idea of this paper is to propose a Sliding Mode Supervised Fractional order controller (SMSF) which consists of conventional PI controller, FO-PI controller and sliding mode supervisor (SMS) that employs one of the controllers to ensure good steady and transient states. WECS laboratory prototype is built around real-time dSPACE cards and evaluated to verify the validity of the developed SMSF. The results clearly fulfill the requirements, confirm its high performance in steady and transient states and demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness.

AB Offshore production of macroalgae biomass, which was recently given the name seagriculture, is one of the important but least explored alternative energy resources. Unlike microalgae, macroalgae cultivation can be done offshore and therefore brings real news to the biofuel food land agriculture conflict. A wide variety of small-scale laboratory experiments are done lately in order to deepen the knowledge and develop expertise in macroalgae cultivation and its downstream processing. For energy applications, it is common to evaluate the performance of an energy source or system in exergy efficiency terms. Another important parameter that is evaluated to determine the system's environmental impact is it's volumetric and areal footprint. The current work examines two exergy efficiency indexes, the Exergy Efficiency (EE), which takes into account all exergy inputs, and the Exergy Return On Investment (ExROI), that includes only fossil fuel exergy inputs, both on a green macroalgae Ulva grown in the macroalgae photobioreactor system (MPBR) incorporated into a building. Cultivation of macroalgae in the building embedded MPBR achieved maximal values of 0.012 and 0.22 for EE and ExROI, compared to a range of 0.05-8.34 and 0.013-0.327 found in published papers of microalgae systems. In addition, a modelled optimization of the initial biomass density leads to maximal values of about 0.035 for EE and 0.433 for ExROI, while further improvement may be achieved by optimization of nutrient addition and mixing methodology. This work demonstrates a tool to measure the performance of laboratory scale macroalgae biomass cultivation systems, followed by preliminary efficiency and environmental impact values, important for future upscaling.

AB The rated cooling capacity of an absorption subsystem in a solar absorption-subcooled compression hybrid cooling system is difficult to design for the entire working period owing to the differences in monthly meteorological data. In addition, the annual performance of the hybrid system deteriorates significantly when the size of the absorption subsystem is designed improperly. Accordingly, the effect of the nominal cooling capacity in the absorption subsystem on the annual performance of an SASCHCS is assessed by means of energy, economic, and environmental analyses. A corresponding model is developed. Additionally, the annual total energy savings, payback period, net present value, and CO2 emissions for different sizes of absorption subsystems are calculated and analysed. It is found that the size of the absorption chiller in the solar absorption-subcooled compression hybrid cooling system should be designed according to the meteorological data for the month of May, when the solar irradiance is at a medium level. The maximum energy saving fractions of a hybrid facility from April to October are 7.67%, 9.42%, 7.62%, 9.16%, 9.29%, 10.2%, and 11.0%, respectively. The minimum values of LCCP and CO2 emissions are 2532.46 t and 113.04 t, respectively. The rated cooling capacity of the absorption subsystem should be designed as 50 kW according to the maximum energy savings and optimal CO2 emissions. It turns to be 47 kW based on the shortest payback period of 17.73 years, as well as the highest net present value. This paper is helpful in improving the performance of solar absorption-subcooled compression hybrid cooling system during the entire operational period.

AB Carbon derived from waste biomass has emerged as a promising candidate towards the synthesis of catalyst or catalyst support for chemical and enzymatic reactions. Excellent surface properties like large specific surface area and high porosity make carbon an exceptional contender for catalyst support. Moreover, appreciable electron conductivity and relative chemical inertness enrich its applicability in chemical processes. The biomass derived carbon catalysts are environmentally benign for reducing carbon footprint and cost competitive to other heterogeneous catalysts available for biodiesel production. Carbons functionalized with different alkali metals, SO3H group, alkoxides, enzymes and transition metals enhance the catalytic activity in the transesterification of triglycerides to alkyl esters. Biodiesel, a promising alternative to the conventional petro-diesel is studied globally in the modern era. The cost-effective process for the biodiesel synthesis involves heterogeneous catalysis employing various catalyst supports. The traditional process of biodiesel synthesis is expensive on the indus trial scale; hence, heterogeneous catalysis plays a vital role in minimizing the cost of the final product due to high stability, efficient activity, and noticeable reusability. For the success of biorefinery concept in the present day and sustainable development towards future, there is a need for the design of a new generation of multifunctional catalysts perhaps consisting of carbon as a support derived from waste biomass. This, in turn, will enhance the selective transformation of non-conventional sources into biodiesel as a sustainable source of energy. Henceforth, the present review offers a broad synopsis on the synthesis of evolving carbonaceous catalysts such as activated carbon, graphene, carbon nanotubes, carbon monoliths and carbon nanohorns for their use in biodiesel production.

AB Proteinuria is a common adverse effect of renal injury in preeclampsia. To explore the effects of AKR1C3 in renal injury due to preeclampsia and to determine an optimal method to prevent proteinuria, glibenclamide treatment was used in unrestrained Wistar rats exposed to N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME). Successful rat models for preeclampsia were confirmed based on mean arterial pressure, a 24-h protein urine test, and by observing the structure of the kidney by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Forty Wistar rats were randomly divided into L-NAME-induced preeclampsia (pregnant and L-NAME), treatment (pregnant, L-NAME, and glybenclamide), non-pregnant (L-NAME), and control (pregnant and 0.9% saline) groups. Rats that were 19 days into their pregnancies were then euthanized and their kidneys were collected. After exposure to L-NAME, the mean arterial pressure increased by similar to 25mmHg, which was largely prevented by the co-administration of glibenclamide. At 24 h, protein levels in the urine of the L-NAME-induced preeclampsia group were higher than those of the control and treatment groups. AKR1C3 was downregulated in the kidney and podocytes, whereas glibenclamide increased the expression of AKR1C3. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) detected by ELISA was decreased by the glibenclamide co-administration. Compared with that in the L-NAME induced preeclampsia group, the expression levels of AKR1C3 protein and mRNA significantly increased in the treatment group ([0.48 +/- 0.09] vs.[1.05 +/- 0.20];[0.05 0.02] vs.[0.22 +/- 0.06]; both P<0.05]). Therefore, AKR1C3 expression was decreased in the kidneys of L-NAME-induced preeclampsia rats, and glibenclamide may be useful for the treatment of preeclampsia by regulating the generation of ROS and preventing proteinuria.

AB NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2 and CUC) transcription factors play an important role in resisting abiotic stress in plants. In this study, a novel NAC gene, designated SINAC8 from Suaeda liaotungensis K. was characterized. S1NAC8 protein is localized in the nucleus, and the yeast one-hybrid screening showed that it contains an activation domain in its C-terminus and functions as a transcriptional activator. Gene expression analysis revealed that it is induced by drought and salt stress. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing SINAC8 demonstrated enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stress, showing significant advantages in seed germination, root growth, shoot growth, and survival rate compared with controls. Moreover, transgenic plants had a significantly higher proline concentration, antioxidant enzyme activity (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase), and level of chlorophyll fluorescence than wild-type, and a significantly lower malondialdehyde concentration and electrolyte leakage under drought and salt stress. The overexpression of SWAGS in transgenic plants also enhanced the expression of stress-responsive genes such as RD20, GSTF6, COR47, RD29A, RD29B, and NYC1. In summary, S1NAC8, as a transcription factor, may change the physiological-biochemical characteristic of plants by regulating the expression of stress-responsive genes and enhance the drought and salt stress tolerance of plants. S1NAC8 can be utilized for developing drought and salinity tolerance in crop plants through genetic engineering.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Background: Identification of new HIV infections (HIV incidence) is critical for monitoring AIDS epidemic and assessing the effectiveness of intervention measures. However, current methods for distinguishing new infections from newly diagnosed HIV-1 patients are still imperfect. We explored utilizing miRNAs as biomarker to identify HIV new infections.
   Methods: According to the HIV-1 status and the estimated duration of infection (EDI), we enrolled participants and divided them into three groups: healthy control, new infection (within 1 year), and old infection (longer than 1 year). Participants were assigned into screening set or validation set. miRNA microarray was performed in screening set and the differentially expressed miRNAs were screened out. The differentially expressed miRNAs were further confirmed in validation set and HIV-1 IIIB-MT2 cells infection system.
   Results: In screening set, 5 miRNAs including miR-1291, miR-3609, miR-3162-3p, miR-874-5p and miR-4258 were screened out for their differential expression in plasma among three groups. In validation set, down-trend of miR-3162-3p was validated from healthy control, new infection to old infection groups. In HIV-1 IIIB-MT2 system, the levels of miR-3162-3p also decreased along with infection duration in vitro. Sensitivity and specificity for miR-3162-3p to distinguish new infection from old infection were 100.0% and 71.43%, respectively, with the cut-off value of 0.916.
   Conclusion: miR-3162-3p in plasma could be a potential microRNA biomarker to identify HIV new infections in HIV-1 infected patients.

AB Despite the significant advances in the comprehension of stem cell control network, the nature of extrinsic signals regulating their dynamic remains to be understood. In this paper, we take advantage of the stem cell repopulation process that follows low-dose X-ray treatment in planarians to identify genes, preferentially enriched in differentiated cells, whose expression is activated during the process. Genetic silencing of some of them impaired the stem cell repopulation, suggesting a tight extrinsic control of stem cell activity.

AB MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is an important regulator of cell signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Here, we attempted to discover new ligands of miR-21 pre-element by carrying out stepwise high throughput virtual screening against a chemical library consisting of over 4 million lead-like compounds. In the procedure, a synthetic strategy that integrated empirical exclusion, molecular docking, druglikeness evaluation, consensus scoring and manual culling was employed to computationally identify seven promising hits from the large compound library, of which four were determined to have moderate or high affinity for miR-21 pre-element (K-D range between 3.7 and 109 mu M). We also evaluated the putative binding site and predicted interaction mode of pre-element with its identified compound ligands by inversion mutation of the wild-type pre-element to mutant [U11A/A20U], and explored the sequence-specific recognition in pre-element-ligand interactions by generating a background of numerous random RNA decoys. It was revealed that most of identified pre-element binders are positively charged to meet the electrostatic complementarity with the negative electrostatic potential surface of RNA molecule, and the compound selectivity seems related partially to their affinity.

AB Lysigenous aerenchyma is formed through programmed cell death (PCD) in Typha angustifolia leaves. However, the genome and transcriptome data for this species are unknown. To further elucidate the molecular basis of PCD during aerenchyma formation in T. angustifolia leaves, transcriptomic analysis of T. angustifolia leaves was performed using Illumina sequencing technology, revealing 73,821 unigenes that were produced by assembly of the reads in T1, T2 and T3 samples. The important pathways, such as programmed cell death (PCD), aerenchyma formation, and ethylene responsiveness were regulated by these unigenes. 1-aminocyclopropane-l-carboxylate synthase (ACS) and 1-aminocyclopropane-l-carboxylate oxidase (ACO) were highly up-regulated as key enzymes for ethylene synthesis, along with respiratory burst oxidase homolog (RBOH), metallothionein, calmodulin-like protein (CML), and polygalacturonase (PG), may collectively explain the PCD involved in T. angustifolia aerenchyma formation. We hypothesize that fermentation, metabolism and glycolysis generate ATP for PCD. We searched the 73,821 unigenes against protein databases, and 24,712 were annotated. Based on sequence homology, 16,012 of the 73,821 annotated unigenes were assigned to one or more Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Meanwhile, a total of 9537 unigenes were assigned to 126 pathways in the KEGG database. In summary, this investigation provides important guidelines for exploring the molecular mechanisms of aerenchyma formation in aquatic plants.

AB 14-3-3 proteins are a type of highly conserved acidic proteins, which are distributed over a wide variety of organisms and are involved in multiple cellular processes. While the comparative and evolutionary analysis of this gene family is unavailable in various fish species. In this study, we identified 101 putative 14-3-3 genes in 11 fish species and divided them into 5 groups via phylogenetic analysis. Synteny analysis implied conserved and dynamic evolution characteristics near the 14-3-3 gene loci in some vertebrates. We also found that some recombination events have accelerated the evolution of this gene family. Moreover, a positive selection site was also identified, and mutation of this site could reduce the 14-3-3 stability. Divergent expression profiles of the zebrafish 14-3-3 genes were further investigated under organophosphorus stress, suggesting that they may be involved in the different osmoregulation and immune response. The results will serve as a foundation for the further functional investigation into the 14-3-3 genes in fishes.

AB Two new neuroblastoma susceptibility loci at 3q25 (RSRC1 rs6441201 G > A) and 4p16 (CPZ rs3796725 T > C and rs3796727 A > G) were identified by a genome-wide association study (GWAS) involving Italians, African Americans and European Americans. In this case-control study with 393 neuroblastoma cases and 812 controls, we investigated the association between these three polymorphisms and neuroblastoma susceptibility in Chinese population. We found that participants harboring the RSRC1 rs6441201A allele were associated with an increased risk of neuroblastoma (AA vs. GG: adjusted OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.03-2.34, P = 0.036). No significant association between the CPZ polymorphisms (rs3796725 T > C and rs3796727A > G) and neuroblastoma susceptibility was observed. In conclusion, our results confirm that the RSRC1 rs6441201A allele is associated with neuroblastoma susceptibility in Chinese population.

AB The mitochondrial genome provides sets of genome-level characteristics, which can be useful in resolving ancient relationships. The complete mitochondrial genomes of five Reticunassa and one Nassarius were sequenced, including Reticunassa hiradoensis, R. fratercula, R. festiva complex A, B and C and Nassarius variciferus, and compared with other two Nassariidae species (Tritia reticulatus and T. obsolete). Eight genomes show the same gene order as in other caenogastropods, containing 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosome RNA genes and 22 transfer RNA genes, except R. fratercula, which lacks the trnF. Three-nucleotide deletion in nad6 genes, truncated major non-coding regions are detected in all Reticunassa mitogenomes. The reconstructed phylogenetic trees show (Reticunassa + (Tritia + Nassarius)) at genus level and support the relationship between R. festiva-C and the Glade formed by R. hiradoensis + R. fratercula and R. festiva-A + R. festiva-B within Reticunassa. The specific mitogenomic characters and phylogenetic analyses support the validity of genus Reticunassa. Pairwise genetic distances of protein-coding genes between R. festiva complex A, B and C range from 0.063 to 0.109, which are close to that of R. hiradoensis and R. fratercula (0.065), and higher than those of several closely related sister species of mollusks. These variation in mitochondria] genomes of Reticunassa indicate that R. festiva-A, R. festiva-B and R. festiva-C should be considered as separate species.

AB Apelin is an adipocyte-derived peptide that plays an important role in regulation of energy homoeostasis and decrease of insulin resistance. We investigated the effects of exercise training on adipose tissue apelin expression in streptozotocin-nicotinamide induced diabetic rats. In this experimental study, 38 male Wistar rats were assigned to 4 groups: sedentary non-diabetic, trained non-diabetic, sedentary diabetic and trained diabetic. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin and nicotinamide in adult rats. The trained groups ran 8-week on treadmill progressively for 45 min at a speed of 24 m/min and a 5% grade. After the training period, an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed in addition to the measurement of blood lipids and plasma apelin levels. Apelin mRNA levels in visceral adipose tissue were also analyzed. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Pearson correlation coefficient was used for analyzing data. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results indicated a significant decrease of insulin resistance followed by a significant increase of plasma levels and mRNA expression of apelin in trained diabetic compared with sedentary diabetic rats. Furthermore, apelin levels did not correlate significantly with body weight and epididymal fat weight in trained diabetic rats. In conclusion, the findings revealed that chronic exercise training, independently of body weight and fat pad weight by decrease of insulin resistance can increase apelin levels in visceral adipose tissue, thereby attenuating the progression of diabetes and decreasing insulin resistance in T2DM rats.

AB Accumulating evidence suggests that the aberrant expression of long non-coding RNAs is closely related to the carcinogenesis and progression of gastric cancer (GC), which is a type of prevalent tumor with a high incidence and mortality rate. However, it is still a challenge to find reliable biomarkers and to understand their molecular mechanisms in GC. In this study, we first confirmed that LINC00941 was up-regulated in GC tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues by RT-PCR, and found that the expression level of LINC00941 was correlated with invasion depth, lymphatic metastasis, and the TNM stage of patients with GC. Furthermore, by performing enrichment analysis based on the co-expression network and regulatory network, we found that LINC00941 was associated with cancer related biological processes such as cell cycle, cell communication, cell migration, cell division, as well as processes associated with the immune system. Our results suggested that LINC00941 may be a potential novel biomarker for therapeutic or diagnostic of GC.

AB Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is frequently activated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Better understanding the mechanism for its over-activation would help the therapy. In this study, we have shown that the stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) is up-regulated in the HCC tissues. Functional studies showed that STIP1 promoted the growth, colony formation and migration of cancer cells. However, knocking down the expression of STIP1 inhibited the growth, colony formation and migration of cancer cells. Molecular mechanism study showed that STIP1 interacted with Axin, enhanced the interaction between Axin and DVL2, thus activated beta-catenin/TCF signaling. Taken together, our study demonstrated the oncogenic roles of STIP1 in the progression of HCC, and suggested that STIP1 might be a therapeutic target.

AB Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) incidence is increasing globally and nationally. The etiology of the disease includes environmental and genetic factors. Polymorphism of adiponectin gene was found to be implicated in the pathogenesis of T2DM in numerous populations.
   Methods: A case-control study was conducted to assess the association of rs2241766 and rs822395 SNPs of adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) with T2DM in Iraqi population. The study included 400 patients with T2DM and 400 healthy individuals served as a control group. Serum lipid concentrations, insulin level and the index of insulin resistance (HOMA) were measured. The genotyping of ADIPOQ for rs2241766 and rs822395 SNPs was performed by PCR-RFLP.
   Results: The genotype distribution of rs2241766 SNP indicated a significant increase of carriers of the homozygous GG (OR: 5.04, CI95%: 2.27-11.19, P: 0.0001) and heterozygous TG (OR: 1.7, CI95%: 1.22-2.39, P: 0.002) variants when compared with those of the wild type, suggesting a risk factor of 2 and 5 to develop the disease. The minor allele frequency (MAF) G was observed to be significantly (P: 0.0001) higher in patients (22%) when compared with the control group (11.74%). Results of rs822395 SNP failed to exhibit a significant difference. Changes of BMI, cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin and insulin resistance index values in the diabetic patients seemed to be parallel with the presence of MAF of rs2241766 SNP.
   Conclusion: The rs2241766T > G SNP of adiponectin gene is a risk factor for the development of T2DM in Iraqi population and directs the changes of serum lipid concentrations as well as insulin resistance.

AB Amanita exitialis Zhu L. Yang & T.H. Li is the species responsible for the largest number of mushroom-associated human poisonings and fatalities in South China due to its lethal cyclic peptide toxins. Prolyl oligopeptidase B (POPB) is considered a key enzyme in the production of the highly toxic cyclic peptide a-amanitin. However, the POPB gene of A. exitialis has not been studied. In the present study we cloned and sequenced the full-length A. exitialis POPB (AePOPB) gene. The aim was to verify the gene structure and functions of AePOPB. The full-length sequence of AePOPB is 3144 bp, including 18 exons encoding 730 aa, and the advanced structure is very similar to that of the previously reported POPB in Galerina marginata (GmPOPB). The amino acid sequence of AePOPB is highly homologous with those from other amanitin-producing lethal mushrooms, implying that AePOPB may have a similar role in the biosynthesis of cyclic peptide toxins. Expression levels of AePOPB were detectable in all parts and developmental stages of the fruiting bodies, and AePOPB was expressed more strongly at early development stages (early and late elongation stages). At early and late elongation stages, the expression peaks occurred in the stipe, whereas at early and late mature stages, the expression peaks occurred in the pileus. The expression patterns of AePOPB in different stages and different parts of the fruiting bodies were highly consistent with those of Ae alpha-AMA, which is required for alpha-amanitin accumulation. These results indicate that AePOPB should be involved in the alpha-amanitin biosynthesis in A. exitialis.

AB Endothelial cell-specific molecule 2 (ECSM2) is a transmembrane protein located in cell-cell junction of endothelial cells (EC). ECSM2 was determined to play an important role in vascular development, EC migration, apoptosis and proliferation, however, no functional domains were determined in intracellular and extracellular region of ECSM2. In current work, functional domains of ECSM2, the relationship of ECSM2 with other endothelial specific protein such as VE-cadherin and the role of ECSM2 in neovascular diseases were determined. It was shown that the 54th amino acid residue of ECSM2 extracellular domain was a tyrosine phosphorylation site, whose mutation led to the loss of EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibition of cell migration. In primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells, ECSM2 bound with VE-cadherin and VEGF stimulation enhanced their binding. In hepatocellular carcinoma, ECSM2 expression was increased, as compared with paracancerous tissue. This data firstly revealed the functional sites of ECSM2, the crosstalk between ECSM2 and other endothelial cell specific molecules, the expression of ECSM2 in tissues of angiogenesis diseases, thus providing understanding about ECSM2 in depth.

AB This study aims to understand the origin of giant magnesite and talc deposits in the Liaohe Group (Liaoning Province, NE China). Magnesite stromatolites and the composition of fluid inclusions suggest that magnesite or high-Mg calcite precipitated directly from strongly restricted seawater pools with meteoric influx. A primary evaporitic origin is also indicated for parts of the investigated dolomites by comparably heavy delta O-18 values. Later, intense metasomatic activity led to the formation of a magnesite/dolomite succession with irregular contacts and a lighter isotopic signature of oxygen. A slight shift in delta O-18 to more positive values was observed for talc-hosting magnesite, which can be explained by the incorporation of isotopically light oxygen into talc. This highlights that the hydrothermal processes that led to talc formation influenced the hosting carbonates as well, which is also documented by a tendency to smaller crystal sizes, a higher whiteness and lower trace element concentrations in samples from locations nearby large talc bodies. Although delta C-13 is suggested to be less sensitive to hydrothermal activity, comparably light delta C-13 values were determined for magnesite sinters, as well as for remobilized magnesites. In general, the delta C-13 signature of the investigated magnesites is lighter than expected for Proterozoic carbonates. A single-stage generation of the giant talc deposit in the study area is suggested based on elemental and isotopic data. Later deformation led to a (iso-chemical) re-location of talc at least once. During this process, irregularly distributed, cloudy/massive talc bodies acted as weak zones and were incorporated into shear bands up to several meters in thickness, which form the actually present, structurally controlled deposit. The original ore type is preserved only in areas with minor deformation. Lamprophyre dykes prove Jurassic volcanism and are clearly younger than the main phase of talc generation. A younger (post-Jurassic?), intense tectonic event is indicated by strongly tectonized dyke material that is re-worked into strike-slip faults and shows siliceous contact zones to the surrounding magnesite. These faults occasionally cross-cut the older, deposit-forming talc shear bands, indicating that the event that led to the deformation of lamprophyre dykes was younger than the main phase of talc re-location. However, this younger event did not lead to a second phase of major talc generation or affect the quality of the initial deposit to a large extent.

AB Scheelite is one of the main ore minerals in tungsten deposits, and Sr isotopic compositions of scheelite can be used to examine the petrogenesis of igneous rocks and fluid metasomatism in mineralization processes. Both thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) and femsecond laser ablation multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (fs-LA-MC-ICP-MS) have been applied to analyze Sr isotopic compositions in scheelite. Here we describe a LA-MC-ICP-MS technique which can obtain in-situ, accurate, high precision Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios from 20 to 50 pm scheelite in line mode without requiring time-consuming mineral separation and pre-chemical procedures. We found that Ca dimers and Ca argides do not detectably affect the obtained Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios, and the adopted protocol overcomes interferences from Kr+, Rb+, Er2+ and Yb2+. The results of three MPI-DING reference glasses (KL2-G, ML3B-G and StHs6/80-G) are consistent with the recommended values. Here we show that the values of Sr-87/Sr-86 are relatively homogeneous for two scheelites from quartz veins, and are comparable to the values determined by a traditional solution method. Hence, these two scheelite samples have the potential to be reference materials for Sr isotopic determination by LA-MC-ICP-MS. To illustrate the utility of the technique, Sr isotopes of scheelites from three different types of tungsten deposits of South China are documented. The Sr-87/Sr-86 of scheelite from granite-related veinlet-disseminated and porphyry tungsten deposits varies systematically, showing a positive correlation between Sr content and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios. These micrometer scale inhomogeneities could be explained by mixing of two components, reflecting intense fluid metasomatism during mineralization processes. High Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios were obtained for the scheelite samples from a quartz vein type tungsten deposit, indicating that the late stage ore-forming fluid was mainly derived from the surrounding strata. These examples show that in-situ Sr isotopic measurement of scheelite is a powerful tool to decipher the degree of fluid-rock interaction in ore-forming processes.

AB The Barluk arc, situated in West Junggar, is an important component of the Kazakhstan domain in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). However, the nature of the Barluk arc (active continental margin or oceanic island arc) is in debate. The igneous rocks in the Shiwu area, Barluk arc, have diagnostic petrologic, geochronologic and geochemical signatures that uncover the attributes of the Barluk arc. In this paper, we report detailed petrology, whole rock geochemistry and Sr-Nd isotopic, zircon U-Pb dating and Hf isotopic data of igneous rocks in the Shiwu area. Our results reveal that: (1) except for 302.2 Ma gabbro, igneous rocks from Barluk arc in the Shiwu area are dioritic and granitic, have ages ranging from 323.8 to 310.5 Ma, and they have geochemical signatures originated from typical continental arcs, including calc-alkaline series rocks, enrichment of LILE, depletion of HFSE, and higher Th/Yb and Ta/Yb values; (2) the granitic porphyry and rhyolite in Barluk arc have old T-DM2(Hf) ages, up to 1091 Ma, suggesting the existence of Precambrian crust or similar materials as their sources; and (3) The 302.2 Ma gabbro dike has high values of epsilon Nd(t) (+ 7.54) and epsilon Hf(t) (+ 12.8 to + 15.5), and a young T-2DM (Nd) age (455 Ma), and therefore it was possibly related to upwelling of asthenosphere mantle in a post-subduction extensional tectonic setting. Based on these parameters, we suggest that the Barluk arc is defined as a Late Paleozoic continental margin arc along the margin of the Kazakhstan Continent. Westward subduction of the Junggar Oceanic plate in the Barluk area started in Early Devonian and continued to the Late Carboniferous (310 Ma). Subsequent post-collisional tectonic processes between the Junggar Oceanic plate and Kazakhstan Continent continued to the Late Carboniferous (302 Ma).

TI Devonian volcanic rocks of the southern Chinese Altai, NW China:
   Petrogenesis and implication for a propagating slab-window magmatism

AB Ridge-trench interaction is a common tectonic process of the present-day Pacific Rim accretionary orogenic belts, and this process may facilitate "slab-window" magmatism that can produce significant thermal anomalies and geochemically unusual magmatic events. However, ridge-trench interaction has rarely been well-documented in the ancient geologic record, leading to grossly underestimation of this process in tectonic syntheses of plate margins. The Chinese Altai was inferred to have undergone ridge subduction in the Devonian and a slab-window model is proposed to interpret its high-temperature metamorphism and geochemically unique magmatic rocks, which can serve as an excellent and unique place to refine the tectonic evolution associated with ridge subduction in an ancient accretionary orogeny. For this purpose, we carried out geochemical and geochronological studies on Devonian basaltic rocks in this region. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) zircon U-Pb dating results yield an age of 376.2 +/- 2.4 Ma, suggesting an eruption at the time of Late Devonian. Geochemically, the samples in this study have variable SiO2 (43.3-58.3 wt%), low K2O (0.02-0.07 wt%) and total alkaline contents (2.16-5.41 wt%), as well as Fe2O3T/MgO ratios, showing typical tholeiitic affinity. On the other hand, the basaltic rocks display MORB-like REE patterns ((La/Yb)(N) = 0.90-2.57) and (Ga/Yb)(N) = 0.97-1.28), and have moderate positive epsilon(Nd)(t) values (+4.4 to + 5.4), which collectively suggest a derivation from a mixing source comprising MORB-like mantle of a mature back-arc basin and subordinate arc mantle wedge. These basaltic rocks are characterized by Low La/Yb (1.26-3.69), Dy/Yb (1.51-1.77) and Sm/Yb (0.83-1.32) ratios, consistent with magmas derived from low degree (similar to 10%) partial melting of the spinel lherzolite source at a quite shallow mantle depth. Considering the distinctive petrogenesis of the basaltic rocks in this region, the Late Devonian basalts in the southern Chinese Altai is suggested to have witnessed the propagating process of slab-window magmatism that was induced by ridge subduction in a nascent rifting stage of a back-arc basin.

AB The Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic thermochronology in the southern Songliao Basin was determined using apatite and zircon fission track analysis data. It is crucial to deciphering the evolution of the Songliao Basin and changes in the movement direction of the Pacific Plate. We present eight new apatite and eight corresponding zircon fission track data from borehole samples across the Baixingtu uplift. The apatite fission track (AFT) thermo-chronological modeling reveals that the basin underwent two distinct compression- and extension-related uplift stages of rapid cooling during the Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic: stage I during the Late Cretaceous-Early Paleogene (similar to 70-52 Ma), stage II in the Late Paleogene-Early Neogene (similar to 38-10 Ma). The AFT data vary from 76.0 +/- 5.0 to 25.3 +/- 1.9 Ma and the zircon binomial peak fitting ages ranged from 79 to 61 Ma, all younger than the stratigraphic ages (similar to 92-88 Ma) of their host rocks. One sample had similar fission track ages (apatite 76.0 +/- 5.0 Ma and zircon 79.0 +/- 3.0 Ma) within reasonable error, representing a magmatic event. The data were divided into four groups. (i) 79-76 Ma: magmatic cooling event, (ii) 69-61 Ma: uplift of the whole region and exhumation and erosion, (iii) 37-34 Ma and (iv) similar to 25 Ma: various uplift events related to tectonic inversion, causing partial uplift, exhumation and erosion in the basin. This created favorable conditions for formation and storage of mineral resources, especially sandstone uranium ore deposits. Our results combined with previous research suggest that the variation in uplift and exhumation began in the basin's SE part and propagated to the NW similar to 5-8 Ma later. The tectonic inversion in the southern Songliao Basin at least began similar to 37-34 Ma. This corresponds with the time of the Paleo-Pacific Plate shifting to NWW motion and the India-Asia collision. These regional-scale uplift, exhumation and inversion events were probably responses to the subduction and turning of the Paleo-Pacific Plate from the southeast and the collision of the Indian subcontinent from the southwest. It is important to study the tectonic inversion in the whole east of China since the Late Cretaceous and the change of the direction of the Pacific plate movement.

AB We report the first finding of prehnite in the southern Sinai peninsula, in a uralitized gabbro developed at the contact of the appinitic gabbro of the Wadi Nasb mafic intrusion (WNMI) with younger granitic intrusions. Subsolidus reactions with hydrothermal fluids caused the gabbro to gain Al2O3 and CaO while losing SiO2, Fe2O3, TiO2, P2O5, Ba, Nb, Zr and Y. Uralitization proceeded through two stages of alteration and mineral replacement. The early stage includes uralitization of pyroxene, formation of new biotite as aggregates of small flakes, transformation of primary amphiboles into actinolite and actinolitic hornblende, and saussuritization of plagioclase. The late stage of alteration is characterized by chloritization of mafic minerals. Apparent crystallization temperatures of the primary relics of pyroxene, hornblende and biotite range from 800-1000 degrees C, 865-925 degrees C, and similar to 700 degrees C, respectively, suggesting partial resetting of the biotite exchange thermometer. The early biotite-forming alteration occurred at moderate temperature (300-450 degrees C), while the late chlorite-forming alteration occurred at low temperature (< 300 degrees C). The prehnite occurs in several forms: (1) fine grained aggregates mostly replacing feldspar and amphibole; (2) prehnite-biotite intergrowths; and (3) small veinlets and vug fillings. The formation of prehnite during the first stage is connected to alteration of pyroxene to secondary amphiboles and of plagioclase to albite, which released the CaO necessary for the development of prehnite. On the other hand, the late stage prehnite probably formed by open-system modification of the chemistry during late-stage fluid interaction.

AB The Qiangtang Basin is the largest Mesozoic marine basin in the Tibetan Plateau. The Upper Triassic black mudstones are among the most significant hydrocarbon source rocks in this basin. Here, we present geochemical data for the Upper Triassic black mudstones to determine their paleoenvironment conditions, provenance, and tectonic setting. To achieve these, 30 black mudstones formed in various sedimentary environments were collected from the Zangxiahe, Zana, and Bagong formations. The results show that the total REE concentrations of mudstones from these formations range from 169 to 214 ppm, 204 to 220 ppm, and 141 to 194 ppm, respectively. All samples have chondrite-normalized REE patterns with enrichment of LREE, depletion of HREE and negative Eu and Ce anomalies. Specifically, mudstones from the Bagong Formation exhibit higher negative Eu anomalies and lower REE contents than those from the Zangxiahe and Zana formations.
   Mudstones from the Zangxiahe and Zana formations with low Sr/Ba and Sr/Cu ratios indicate the humid climate, whereas the high Sr/Ba and Sr/Cu ratios of rocks from the Bagong Formation suggest the arid climate. The low U/Th, (Cu + Mo)/Zn, V/Cr and Ni/Co ratios of rocks from the Zangxiahe, Zana, and Bagong formations are indicators of oxidized conditions. The bivariate diagrams (TiO2 vs. Al2O3, TiO2 vs. Zr, La/Th vs. Hf, and Co/ Th vs. La/Sc) reveal that mudstones from the Zangxiahe and Zana formations were potentially derived from intermediate igneous rocks, whereas mudstones from the Bagong Formation were probably sourced from felsic igneous rocks. Their source rocks are mostly deposited in the collisional setting. REE of mudstones from the Zangxiahe, Zana, and Bagong formations were possibly originated from terrigenous detritus, with minor non-terrigenous contributions into the Zana samples. The REE contents of these mudstones are controlled mainly by terrigenous detrital minerals, rather than by the paleoclimate, paleoredox conditions, or organic matter. However, calcite minerals could dilute REE. Therefore, the REE contents of the Bagong Formation mudstones are significant lower than those of the Zangxiahe and Zana formations mudstones.

AB The Neoproterozoic Malani Igneous Suite (MIS) in NW India, along with analogous magmatic rocks from the adjoining Nagarparkar region in SE Pakistan can be collectively classified as a Silicic-dominated Large Igneous Province (SLIP). This magmatic event includes bimodal (predominantly felsic) volcanism, granite emplacement and felsic and mafic dyke intrusions. Felsic rocks have typical A-type affinity as indicated by high abundance of silica, alkali, high field strength and large ion lithophile element concentrations and low CaO and MgO contents. Their Nb negative anomalies and Zr-saturation parameters indicate significant crustal input and high temperature melting. Mafic volcanics and dykes show geochemical homogeneity and derivation from a depleted continental mantle source without any significant crustal contamination (low U and Th contents and no visible Nb anomaly). The region extending from the Mount Abu batholith in the east to Jaswantpura in the west (2700 km(2)), representing a transition from the metamorphic Sirohi terrane to the undeformed MIS, was evaluated through an integrated structural (including satellite image analysis), geochemical and geochronological study. During the initial stage (prior to 760 Ma) the granitic basement (Erinpura granites) and overlying Sirohi metasediments behaved in a brittle manner that led to development of linear fractures and NNE trending rift structures, and bimodal volcanic activity. Emplacement of voluminous granitic bodies in response to progressive extension of the crust is inferred during the more evolved second stage (younger than 760 Ma). Mirpur Granite, a representative of this younger granitic suite (Jalor type pink granite) has yielded 753 +/- 9 Ma zircon, U-Pb, crystallization age. Granitic plutons mark regions of crustal extension, as seen in parallel alignment of plutonic bodies (Jaswantpura granitic belt) and parallel mafic dyke swarms (340 degrees) transecting the granites. Structural analysis further identified an episode of crustal convergence which is documented in folding and faulting of the Sindreth Basin sequence and in tectonic overprint of early stage mafic rocks. Rifting and bimodal magmatic activity in MIS is coeval with similar rock types in Nagarparkar in SE Pakistan, further traceable into the Seychelles microplate and Central Madagascar. Considering the Neoproterozoic paleogeography and our observations, an extensional setting and an active continental margin position for MIS is inferred.

TI Apatite fission track evidence for Miocene denudation history in the

   the evolution of Southern Tibet

AB Low-temperature thermochronology is used widely in the Tibet plateau uplift. Some researches, however, have defined the time of rapid denudation as simply rock uplift and have neglected the fact that the rock denudation recorded by fission track (FT) data was controlled by both surface incision and rock uplift. The incision of the Yarlung Zangbo River had a significant influence on uplift history inversion in Southern Tibet. This paper simulated the bedrock denudation and river incision histories using apatite fission track (AFT) data sampled from the Gangdese conglomerate belt, which is located in the middle of Southern Tibet, and analyzed the geological meaning of the AFT age of each sample. The results showed the following: (1) In the early Miocene (22-16 Ma), both the value of the denudation rate and the incision rate were high (0.56 mm/yr and 0.24 mm/yr). (2) In the middle-late Miocene, the incision rate (0.12 mm/yr) was similar to the denudation rate (0.09-0.11 mm/yr). (3) The historical model between river incision and bedrock denudation revealed a significant difference in the denudation rate during the period ca. 8-6 Ma. Combining these data with previously published thermochronological ages and synthesizing these ages with regional geological, we arrived at the following conclusions: (1) In the early Miocene, the denudation event probably was caused by a combined result of Indian plate rollback and the incision of the Yarlung Zangbo River. (2) In the middle-late Miocene, the denudation rate was consistent with the incision rate, which suggested that the denudation episode was caused by climate change associated with Asian monsoon intensification. (3) After 8 Ma, the stable and slow incision rate indicated that regional drastic uplift had ceased. The paleo-elevation of the research area had approached, and even exceeded, the present-day elevation in the late Miocene.

AB The South Altun orogenic belt (SAOB), consisting of the South Altun block (SAB) and the South Altun continental block (SACB), is one of several important orogenic belts in NW China. Numerous granite bodies are widely distributed in the SAB. However, the petrogenesis and tectonic environment of these granites, and their relationships to those of the SACB, Central Altun Continental block (CACB), North Altun block (NAB), Qilian block (QLB), and North Qaidam block (NQB) remain unclear. In this investigation, we selected the SAB granites for detailed study, and explore the petrogenesis employing bulk-rock geochemistry, zircon U-Pb dating, and Hf isotopic analysis. Zircon U-Pb LA-ICP-MS dating of the granites from the SAB identified seven spatially distinct Paleozoic plutonic suites: (a) Yigan-352-343 Ma; (b) Baiganhu-448-444 Ma; (c) west Mangya-444-435 Ma; (d) Aketishan-265 Ma; (e) Chaishuigou-406 Ma; (f) Changchungou-469 Ma; and (g) north Mangya-462 Ma. Based on previous research combined with our new U-Pb dating and bulk-rock geochemical investigations in the SAB, we identdified six distinct episodes of granitoid emplacement: episodes 1 and 2, quartz diorite + granodiorite + monzogranite with I-type affinities, and ages of 503-497 Ma and 483-458 Ma, respectively; episode 3, granodiorite + monzogranite + syenogranite with I- and S-type affinities, and an age of 456-432 Ma; episode 4, monzogranite + syenogranite + alkali feldspar granite with A-type affinities, and an age of 424-385 Ma; episode 5, granodiorite + monzogranite with S-type affinities, and an age of 352-338 Ma; and episode 6, quartz diorite + monzogranite + syenogranite with I-type affinities, and an age of 265-264 Ma. Zircon Lu-Hf isotope analyses from various episodes show that epsilon(Hf)(t) values are positive in most cases, but negative for a small number of inherited (xenocrystic) zircons. Source rocks were mainly juvenile crust, evidently mixed with minor ancient continental material. Based on our new results integrated with regional geological data, we conclude that episodes 1 and 2 granitic magma generations were related to the subduction of oceanic crust, episode 3 to post-collisional partial melting, episode 4 to the isostatic adjustment of orogenic blocks after plate suturing, episode 5 to petrotectonic thickening of the Altun crust, and episode 6 to Altun fault transcurrent slip attending Kunlun Paleo Tethys subduction.

AB Atoll-shaped and normal garnets in a low-temperature (LT) and ultra-high-pressure (UHP) metamorphic eclogite of the Dabie orogen were studied by detailed petrographic observation and pseudosection modelling. The normal and atoll garnets exhibit pronounced chemical variations, characterized by the overall increase of pyrope and decrease of grossular content from core to rim. A compositional discontinuity between the inclusion-rich core and the inclusion-poor mantle was defined by a sharp decrease in grossular content and an increase in pyrope. Pseudosection modelling using different effective bulk compositions (EBCs) obtained using XRF and the pointcounting method shows that the eclogite experienced two stages of eclogite-facies metamorphism from a prograde amphibole-eclogite-facies (similar to 500-700 degrees C, < 2.2 GPa) to the peak UHP lawsonite-eclogite-facies (similar to 650 degrees C, similar to 3.3 GPa), followed by an isothermal decompression (1TD) exhumation. Garnet essentially did not grow owing to the parallels between the prograde P-T path and the garnet mode isopleths after the formation of the garnet core. The stable field and the compositions of the peak mineral assemblage at LT-UHP conditions insignificantly depend on the scale of equilibrium. Partial lawsonite and omphacite should be subtracted from the EBCs to obtain reasonable P-T estimates/pseudosections that are consistent with the genesis of atoll-garnet-bearing eclogite. Pseudosection modelling indicates that the infiltration of external fluid into the "dry" eclogite weakened the rigid garnet and produced micro-cracks. These cracks served as permeable pathways, leading ultimately to the consumption of previously formed garnet core and the formation of atoll texture. Previous P-T estimates using conventional garnet-omphacite-phengite thermobarometry are less reliable because omphacite was highly altered owing to net transfer reactions involving omphacite. The atoll texture was developed from prograde to peak UHP metamorphism, and the atoll-garnet forming event in the Dabie eclogite predates the final stage of the UHP metamorphism. The previous Lu-Hf date of c. 221 Ma is thus a maximum estimate of the termination of UHP metamorphism.

AB The Jiaolai Basin, to the east of the Tan-Lu Fault Zone (TLFZ), is a Cretaceous NE-trending basin in eastern North China and has a multi-episodic evolution. Different from other contemporary NW-trending en-echelon graben systems west to the TLFZ, the origin of the Jiaolai Basin (three episodes: K(1)l, 135-120 Ma; K-2q, 120-105 Ma; K-2w, 88-65 Ma) cannot be simply explained by the sinistral displacement of the TLFZ at the beginning of the Early Cretaceous (around ca. 135 Ma). The purpose of this paper is to investigate the critical factors (e.g., bounding faults, tectonic setting, stress field) driving the development of the Jiaolai Basin and constraint its evolution. Three episodes of two-dimensional finite element models were generated in order to determine the roles of the boundary conditions and to reveal the tectonic development of the basin. When compared to the calculated maximum horizontal compressive stress (sigma H-max) trajectories and the observed data, along with a comparison between the Von Mises Stress (u(Von)) and the depocenters of the basin, the calculated results can be well proved by the geological evidence both in stress field evolution and in the basin patterns. Our analysis show that the three episodes of the maximum principle stress trajectories changed from NE-SW (earlier Early Cretaceous, K-1l) NNE-SSW (later Early Cretaceous, K-1q) then E-W (Late Cretaceous, K-2w). Moreover, the results show a good consistency between the u(von) and the depocenters in the basin through geological cross-sections. Via models we suggest that the origin and evolution of the Jiaolai Basin were controlled by three episodes of tectonic events, (i) the reactivated bounding faults and the post-orogenic extension of the Sulu Orogen during the earlier Early Cretaceous, (ii) the lithospheric delamination of the thickened lithosphere during the later Early Cretaceous, and (iii) the likely far-field effects produced by the collision between the Kohistan-Drags arc complex and Asia during the Late Cretaceous. The Jiaolai Basin evolved from extension to pull-apart experiencing volcanic activity during the three episodes of the Cretaceous.

AB The Jintingling gold deposit, located in the Jiaodong peninsula, north China, contains vein-, dissemination- and stockwork-style ores hosted in the Jurassic Linglong granitic pluton. Hydrothermal activities in this deposit are divided into seven stages, including pre-ore massive K-feldspar alteration, specularite-quartz vein (V1), milky quartz +/- sulfide vein (V2), quartz-pyrite vein (V3), massive quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration and gold mineralization, quartz-polymetallic sulfide vein (V4), and quartz-calcite vein (V5). Rhenium-Osmium dating was conducted on molybdenite from V2, yielding an isochron age of 123.3 +/- 3.6 Ma. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating yielded 121.5 +/- 1.5 Ma (1 sigma, MSWD = 0.010) for a pre-ore diorite porphyrite dyke and 117.6 +/- 1.2 Ma (1 sigma, MSWD = 0.018) for a post-ore diorite porphyry dyke, respectively. Thus, gold mineralization occurred at 122-118 Ma.
   Four types of fluid inclusions were identified in quartz veins, including CO2-H2O +/- CH4 inclusions (type I), pure CO2 inclusions (type II), mineral-bearing inclusions (type III) and aqueous inclusions (type IV). Fluid inclusion studies demonstrate that the primary ore-forming fluids contain CO2-rich vapor (357-420 degrees C, 7.2-11.3 wt% NaCl equivalent) and critical fluids (368-400 degrees C). The two phases were likely formed by immiscibility of magmatic-hydrothermal fluids. Later on, the fluids evolved to a H2O-OO2 -NaCl +/- CH4 system which had temperatures of 300-364 degrees C and salinities of 2.0-9.7 wt% NaCl equivalent. The H2O-OO2 NaCI +/- CH4 fluid system may experience phase separation, forming coexisted CO2-H2O +/- CH4 inclusions (homogenized to vapor or liquid at temperature of 265-309 degrees C and 265-287 degrees C, salinities of 3.1-7.1 wt% and 4.3-7.1 wt% NaCl equivalent, respectively) and aqueous inclusions (homogenized to liquid at temperature of 255-294 degrees C and 3.7-7.6 wt% NaCl equivalent). Along with further evolution, the fluids shifted to a H2O-NaCl system, with temperatures of 163-258 degrees C and salinities of 0.5-9.0 wt% NaCl equivalent.
   Pyrite from the Jintingling deposit has delta S-34 values (5.5%0-6.1 parts per thousand) similar to those of pyrite from other gold deposits in the Jiaodong district, indicating that they were related to the same hydrothermal ore-forming system. The delta(13)(CPDB) values of calcite (-4.5%o to -5.4 parts per thousand) in V5 are generally located in the range of magmatic-derived carbon. Fluids of V2, V3, V4 have 81) from -64.4 parts per thousand to -87.1 parts per thousand, and delta O-8 from 8.4 parts per thousand to 0.2 parts per thousand, located in the compositional fields between magmatic water and meteoric water. Collectively, microthermonetric results and isotopic data indicate that the primary ore-forming fluids were most probably magmatic in origin, with incorporation of meteoric water in the later ore-forming stage. Precipitation of gold was triggered by cooling of fluids, fluid immiscibility and decrease of sulfur in the fluids.

TI Involvement of anomalously As-Au-rich fluids in the mineralization of

AB The Mesozoic (similar to 120 Ma) Heilan'gou gold deposit, located in the Jiaodong gold province, eastern margin of the North China Craton (NCC), consists of several ultra-high grade (up to 600 g/t) auriferous quartz veins in the early Cretaceous Guojialing granodioritic pluton. Ore-related pyrite crystals from this deposit show complex textures. In this study, EMP, Nano-SIMS trace element mapping and in-situ sulfur isotope analyses were conducted to characterize the textural and compositional features.
   Two types of pyrite were identified. Type I crystals (Py-I), hosted in gold-quartz-pyrite veins, are generally homogeneous in chemical composition. They contain low concentrations of As (< 0.2 wt.%) and Au < 0.06 wt. %), and have delta S-34 values ranging from 6.6960 to 7.996o. Minor amounts of visible gold grains were observed in fractures of Py-I. Type II pyrite crystals (Py-II), hosted in gold-polymetallic sulfide veins, are commonly composed of an As-poor core (Py-IIa) and an As-rich rim (Py-IIb), with clear boundaries between the two domains. Py-IIb grains normally show oscillatory or patchy zonings of arsenic, and are spatially associated with visible gold and As-Te-Ag-Cu-Pb mineral inclusions. The Py-IIa shows geochemical signatures similar to Py-I, whereas, Py-IIb contains relatively high concentrations of As (0.4-2.5 wt.%, 1.47 wt.% on average) and Au (0.1 wt.% on average), and elevated delta S-34 values (8.1-8.8 parts per thousand).
   Based on the distinctive textural and compositional signatures between Py-IIa and Py-IIb, it is proposed that anomalously As-Au-rich fluids were injected into hydrothermal systems during the late ore-forming stage, which may have intensively interacted with certain sedimentary rocks. The involvement of these fluids, firstly documented in this study, can largely explain the occurrence of native gold ore shoots at Heilan'gou. In addition, the intimate association between As and Au highlights the important roles of As in enrichment of Au in the Jiaodong gold district.

TI Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectono-thermal reconstruction of the western

AB Studies on the tectono-thermal evolution of the western Bohai Bay Basin (WBBB), including the Jizhong Subbasin and Cangxian Uplift, are important for further petroleum exploration and exploitation. This study aims to reconstruct the tectono-thermal history of the WBBB based on a combination of 125 vitrinite reflectance (Ro) data and seven apatite fission track (AFT) and nine apatite (U-Th)/He (AHe) ages. The effective AFT ages range from 60.3 to 97.0 Ma, with mean track lengths of 10.86-12.64 mu m. The variable single-grain AFT ages are explained to be due to the parameter D-par. The effective Alie ages range from 21.1 Ma to 75.0 Ma. Two rapid cooling events revealed by the thermal modeling results occurred during the Early-Late Cretaceous (130-90 Ma) and Late Eocene-Early Miocene (40-18 Ma), respectively. The Fuping Complex, which is located in the western margin of the WBBB and mainly composed of the Paleo-proterozoic high-grade gneisses, experienced the intensive extension-detachment during the Early-Late Cretaceous along with the subduction of the Izanagi Plate, that was probably responsible for the first cooling event. The second cooling event was caused by the subduction of the Pacific Plate during the Middle Eocene-Early Miocene (43-23 Ma), as well as the collision of the Indian and Eurasian Plates and the rollback of the subducting Pacific Plate during the Early Miocene (23-18 Ma). The WBBB experienced two heat flow peaks of similar to 75 and similar to 80 mW/m(2) during the Early Cretaceous and the Late Eocene, respectively. During the Late Eocene-Early Miocene, rapid subsidence in the Baxian Depression (one secondary tectonic unit of the Jizhong Sub-basin) coupled with the rapid uplift in the Cangxian Uplift caused the Shahejie Formation of the middle-upper Eocene to generate gas during the Early Miocene. Meanwhile, tectonic movement during the Early Miocene also caused faults to become migration paths, as revealed by the homogenization temperature of the fluid inclusion. This study provides new insights regarding the tectonic and hydrocarbon evolution of the WBBB.

AB Early Cretaceous tectono-magmatic activity in the eastern North China Craton has long been linked to cratonic destruction, but no systematic investigations about the geodynamic processes have been performed. Early Cretaceous diabases, lamprophyres, andesites and dacites are distributed in the western Shandong Peninsula, and these rocks have a close relationship as they formed synchronously. Zircon U-Pb dating results show that the diabases and lamprophyres formed dykes or sills at 133-127 Ma and that the andesites erupted at similar to 125 Ma. The diabases could be divided into high- and low-Mg# value groups. The high-Mg# (> 60) diabases have lower SiO2 (48.44-54.68 wt%) and higher MgO (7.41-19.30 wt%) contents than the low-Mg# (< 60) ones (SiO2 : 52.90-56.41 wt%; MgO: 2.70-4.37 wt%). The lamprophyres (Mg# values of 58-70) exhibit low SiO2 (45.04-49.99 wt%) and moderate MgO (4.77-9.87 wt%) contents. The diabases and lamprophyres are enriched in large ion lithophile elements (e.g., Ba, Th and U) and light rare earth elements, are depleted in Nb and Ta, and feature negligible Eu anomalies. They have lower zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values (- 12 to -19) and whole-rock epsilon(Nd)(t) values (2 to -12), with (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) ratios of 0.7066-0.7097. The andesites and dacites have intermediate SiO2 contents (60.10-64.95 wt%), high Mg# values (56-65), high Sr (1005-1300 ppm), and low Y (11.3-12.9 ppm) contents, with high Sr/Y ratios (78-115), showing adakitic affinity. They have lower zircon e(Hf)(t) (-12 to - 26) and whole-rock epsilon(Nd)(t) (- 9 to -13) values and high (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) ratios (0.7109-0.7111). We suggest that the diabases and lamprophyres were derived from the partial melting of enriched lithospheric mantle, and the parental magmas of some of them had more contribution from the asthenosphere. The andesites and dacites were derived from the partial melting of delaminated thickened lower crust with addition of mantle material. Since the late Mesozoic, local delamination may have occurred beneath the Shandong Peninsula. During the Early Cretaceous, the rollback process of the Paleo-Pacific slab beneath the Shandong Peninsula could have facilitated delamination of the lithospheric mantle, and enhances the activity of trans-lithospheric faults.

AB The North Yellow Sea Basin is a Meso-Cenozoic continental sedimentary basin located between the Tan-Lu fault and the Imjingang orogenic belt. The Mesozoic strata of the eastern depression in the North Yellow Sea Basin consist of lower (lower part of the Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous), middle (upper part of the Upper JurassicLower Cretaceous) and upper (Lower Cretaceous) supersequences, comprising six third-order sequences, as inferred from seismic, core and well log data. There are five lithology-lithofacies architectures summarized in the third-order sequences of wells A, F, D, E, J, G and H, and they are the interbedded coarse and fine, asymmetric coarse-fine, fine-coarse-fine, coarse-fine-coarse and asymmetric fine-coarse. The basin-controlling faults and their assembly configurations during each tectonic stage were inherited and differential in the depression. The basin-controlling faults were dominated by extension, and strike-slip movement increased gradually during the early stage of the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous. The strike-slip faults were dominant at the late stage of the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous. Right-lateral trans-extensional faulting created the uplift-depression structural framework of the eastern depression. There was another trans-extension in the depression during the Early Cretaceous. Wells A, F and D record subsidence at three different structural locations in a trans-extensional tectonic setting. From the Late Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous, the fault movement changed from transtension to transpression, and the eastern uplift extended from the basin edge into the depression center (now the center turned into a structural high). The present-day central structural belt is a potential area for hydrocarbon accumulation, and its extended or down-dip area may become prospective areas for oil. Hydrocarbon traps analogous to the buried hill or igneous type oil reservoirs may be present in the up-dip area of the eastern uplift.

AB Cu-Mo deposits are commonly associated with talc-alkaline porphyries and derived from subduction-modified lithosphere in magmatic arcs. Here we report the Wangjiazhuang Cu-Mo deposit, which is peculiarly associated with an alkaline quartz monzonite that originated from a metasomatized asthenospheric mantle within an intracontinental setting in the eastern North China Craton (NCC). The deposit was formed at ca. 128.3 +/- 0.7 Ma (2 sigma), basically coincident with the emplacement of the host quartz monzonite (128.8 +/- 1.0 Ma, 2 sigma). Pegmatitic vein-type and stockwork-/disseminated-type mineralizations were identified in the deposit, of which the former is shallowly situated and characterized by coarse and well-crystallized Cu- and Mo-bearing sulfides + quartz + biotite + K-feldspar assemblages, whereas the latter is deeply situated and characterized by stockworks or Cu- and Mo-bearing sulfides disseminated in the altered quartz monzonite. Separation between Cu-rich and Morich ore bodies at shallow depth was also observed. The Cu-Mo mineralization is typically associated with potassic-silicic alteration. High-temperature fluid inclusions with halite/sylvite daughter minerals (having homogenization temperatures of 287-466 degrees C and salinities of 33.8-55.3 wt% NaCl equivalent) suggest a magmatic origin of the ore-forming fluids. Differentiation of the fluids into vapor-rich and liquid-rich phases occurred during the magmatic-hydrothermal processes, as indicated by the coexistence of vapor-rich, liquid-rich and daughter mineral-rich fluid inclusions with similar homogenization temperatures. LA-ICP-MS analysis of the fluid inclusions shows that Cu is highly partitioned into the vapor-rich fluid inclusions, whereas Mo is mainly concentrated in the daughter mineral-rich fluid inclusions. This implies that phase differentiation of the oreforming fluids was likely responsible for the separation of Cu-rich and Mo-rich ore bodies. The presence of hematite in the fluid inclusions also suggests high oxidation state of the ore-forming fluids. Based on the variations of delta S-34 in sulfides and Al contents in quartz, continuous reduction of the oxidized ore-forming fluids, coupled with pH change of the fluids during water-rock interaction, led to the deposition of the ore-forming metals.
   The host quartz monzonite shows adakitic geochemical signatures. Fractional crystallization of low-Mg amphiboles contributed to the adakitic signatures. According to the mixing modeling using Sr-Nd isotopes, the quartz monzonite was mainly derived from asthenospheric mantle-derived magma mixed by similar to 15-20% lower crust components at the base of the lower crust. Zircon saturation thermometry and Ti-in-quartz thermobarometer suggest that the rock was emplaced at the temperature of similar to 746 degrees C and the depth of similar to 4 km. High water (H2O >= 4 wt%) and metal (Cu is up to 840 ppm and Mo is up to 11.9 ppm) contents as well as high oxidation state (f(o2) > fayalite-magnetite-quartz oxygen buffer) are featured in the quartz monzonite, indicating that the asthenospheric mantle source had been hydrated and oxidized by the water released from the stagnant Paleo-Pacific slab in the transition zone (410-610 kin). Such modification by the deep stagnant oceanic slab beneath the eastern NCC thus not only triggered the remarkable thinning of the Archean lithospheric keel (loss of > 120 km), but also promoted the asthenospheric mantle to become the favorable magma and metal source for the Cu-Mo deposits in the study region.

AB Background: Currently, cardiovascular measurements in children affected with type 1 narcolepsy (NT1) have never been investigated, and neither have their modulation by the administration of sodium oxybate (SO).
   Methods: Twelve drug-naive NT1 children (four males, eight females) with a mean age of 11 +/- 3.16 years underwent a nocturnal polysomnography, at baseline and during the first night of SO administration. Data were contrasted with those recorded in 23 age-matched healthy controls. Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis was performed by analyzing the electrocardiogram signal for automatic detection of R waves with a computer program calculating a series of standard time-domain measures and obtaining spectral parameters, by means of a Fast-Fourier Transform.
   Results: In sleep stages N2 and N3, NT1 children showed increased power in the low-frequency (LF) and very-LF (VLF) ranges, when compared to controls. In addition, HRV (as measured by time domain parameters) during all sleep stages tended to be slightly higher in patients when compared to controls. Treatment with SO did not change significantly any parameter, but an overall trend to mildly decreased HRV that reached a significant value only during R sleep.
   Conclusions: HRV during all sleep stages tended to be slightly higher in young patients when compared to controls, confirming the presence of a slight sympathovagal system imbalance even in NT1 children. SO tends to decrease these values especially during REM sleep and in that regard, further studies supporting these preliminary findings and considering the long-term effects of SO on heart rate parameters are warranted.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to summarize the evidence regarding the relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) and the risk of essential hypertension.
   Methods: The study was a dose-response meta-analysis of observational studies. The PubMed, Embase, CNKI, VIP and CBM databases were searched to collect relative studies examining the relationship between OSAS and the risk of essential hypertension. Studies were retrieved from database establishment through September 2016, and new literature published between September 2016 and May 2017 was later supplemented. Linear and non-linear dose-response models were used to assess the relationship between apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI), which was used to reflect the severity of OSAS, and the risk of essential hypertension. Stata 13.0 was used for the meta-analysis.
   Results: Six prospective cohort studies and one case-control study were included, for a total sample size of 6098. The dose-response meta-analysis showed that a high AHI significantly increased the risk of essential hypertension compared with a low AHI (odds ratio (OR) = 1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.30, 2.41), p = 0.001). The linear dose-response meta-analysis showed that the risk of essential hypertension increased by 17% for every 10 events/h increase in the AHI (OR = 1.17, 95% CI (1.07, 1.27), p = 0.001), and the results of the non-linear dose-response meta-analysis showed that the risk of essential hypertension increased with increasing AHI value.
   Conclusion: A potential dose-response relationship exists between the severity of OSAS and the risk of essential hypertension. This relationship should be considered when developing prevention measures for essential hypertension. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) likely represents the prodromal stage of synucleinopathy. The present study was to investigate if there was prospective memory (PM) impairment and the relationship between different PM tasks and traditional cognitive tests in patients with iRBD.
   Methods: A total of 28 patients with iRBD, 25 with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 21 healthy controls were included. The Cambridge Prospective Memory Test (CAMPROMPT) was used to measure the PM including time-based (TBPM) and event-based PM (EBPM). Standard cognitive tests were administered to all participants.
   Results: EBPM scores were lower only in patients with iRBD, while the obvious PM abnormalities were found in patients with PD. The patients with iRBD and PD performed worse on delayed recall of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and copy of the Rey-Osterrieth complex figure (ROCF). The EBPM correlated with attention, executive function, and immediate memory besides working memory in patients with iRBD. The PM tasks involved in more memory functions in PD patients.
   Conclusions: The patients with iRBD were impaired on both episodic memory and EBPM tasks that correlated with attention, executive function, and immediate memory. The PM abnormality was an early cognitive change in iRBD to which more attention should be paid more attention. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: A negative linear association between sleep duration and obesity in children has been reported, but this has been predominantly based on subjective estimates of sleep duration and only one indicator of obesity. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the relationships among objectively measured sleep parameters and a range of obesity indicators in schoolchildren.
   Patients/methods: Baseline data were obtained from 335 elementary schoolchildren (aged 7-12 years) recruited to the study. Five indicators of obesity were determined and two global cut-off points (WHO and International Obesity Task Force) were used to define overweight/obesity. Participants wore wrist actigraphy devices (N = 264) for seven consecutive days/nights to objectively estimate six sleep features.
   Results: Average weekday sleep duration was 7.6 +/- 0.7 h and 42.1% of the participants were overweight/obese. After adjustment, those achieving <8 h of sleep had an increased body mass index z-score (beta = 0.88, p < 0.001), waist circumference (beta = 6.49, p < 0.001), body fat percentage (beta = 5.17, p < 0.001), and fat mass (kg) (beta = 3.23, p < 0.001) compared to those sleeping >= 8 h. Based on two standardized cutoff points for overweight/obesity, sleeping <8 h was associated with an increased risk of obesity (odds ratio (OR) = 3.75, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.56-9.05; OR = 4.79 95% CI: 2.11-10.90).
   Conclusion: Sleep insufficiency, in addition to other lifestyle factors, is likely to play a role in childhood obesity. Lifestyle interventions should include advice regarding sleep improvement with promotion of other healthy lifestyle behaviors to tackle childhood obesity, a serious global public health problem.

AB Objective: Social jetlag, a form of chronic circadian misalignment, has previously been associated with obesity in adults. We aimed to investigate the association between social jetlag and obesity-related characteristics in Dutch adolescents over a 1-year period.
   Methods: We analysed data of 83 adolescents, who were recruited from a Dutch cohort born between the years 1990 and 1993. At the age of 16 and 17y, we determined anthropometric measurements, body composition, physical activity, hours of television use, and self-reported sleep duration. Using linear regression models, we assessed the association between social jetlag, defined as more than a 1-hour difference between the midpoint of sleep during weekdays and weekend days, and body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, and waist circumference at baseline and after one year. We corrected the analysis for sex, sleep, physical activity, and hours of television use.
   Results: At age 16y, we observed that social jetlag was highly prevalent, with only 13% of the adolescents reporting no social jetlag (<= 1 h), whereas 29% and 58% reported a social jetlag of >1-2 h and >= 2 h. In a cross-sectional analysis, we observed at age 16y a significant higher BMI in the group with no social jetlag, compared to the group with >1- to 2-hour and >= 2-hour social jetlag after adjustment for sex (-0.81 kg/m(2), 95% confidence interval = -3.1 to 1.4; and -2.09 kg/m(2), 95% confidence interval = -4.1 to -0.1). This association remained significant after correction for the other possible confounders. No significant associations were observed between social jetlag at age 16y and changes in obesity-related characteristics over one year.
   Conclusion: Our pilot data showed that social jetlag is highly prevalent in adolescents, with social jetlag associated with a lower BMI; however, in this small group, social jetlag was not associated with changes in obesity-related characteristics over time.

AB Objectives: This study aimed to assess the relationship between sleep duration on work or nonworkdays and myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke in Southern China.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 15,364 participants of age >= 15 years in Southern China from November 2013 to August 2014. Data on self-reported duration of sleep on workdays or nonworkdays as well as history of MI and stroke were collected in the questionnaire. The subjects were examined for weight, height, waist circumference, and blood pressure. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association of sleep duration with MI and stroke.
   Result: Overall, compared with a sleep duration of 6-8 h, individuals who slept <6 h on workdays and nonworkdays were associated with increased risk for MI (odds ratio [OR] = 3.17, 2.04). Furthermore, individuals who slept >8 h on workdays and nonworkdays were associated with an increased risk for stroke (OR = 1.86, 1.54). Although this association persisted in men and subjects aged <65 years, we also observed that long sleep duration on workdays was associated with MI, especially among women, and short sleep duration on nonworkdays was associated with stroke among those aged 65 years or older. Participants with abnormal sleep duration and hypertension had higher risk of MI and stroke. Sleep debt was independently associated with MI risk, but not stroke (OR = 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06 -1.86), specifically among men aged <65 years.
   Conclusions: Compared with a sleep duration of 6-8 h, both short and long sleep duration were associated with the prevalence of MI and stroke and these associations were more pronounced among hypertensive persons, and tended to vary by age and sex. Moreover, sleep debt was linked to greater MI risk among men aged <65 years. These findings suggest that we should develop a healthy biological clock. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To determine the scope of sleep concerns, clinical features, and polysomnography (PSG) results and to identify factors that predict obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in a cohort of children with obesity.
   Methods: The study was a multicenter retrospective chart review. Data were collected from three pediatric sleep laboratories over a two year period for all children of age 8-16 years with a body mass index [EMI] >= 95th centile who were undergoing PSG. Data sources included clinical charts and PSG results. Clinical and PSG factors were examined as predictors of OSA.
   Results: A total of 210 children met inclusion criteria, and 205 had sufficient data for analysis. The mean age was 12.5 +/- 2.7 years; and 65% were male. Multiple sleep concerns and comorbidities were reported in most children (90% and 91%, respectively). OSA was identified by PSG in 44% of children; and 28% of children demonstrated moderate/severe OSA. Mouth breathing/nasal congestion (odds ratio [OR] = 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.18-0.61), syndrome/multiple anomalies (OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.22-4.93), and family history of OSA (OR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.2-5.8) or sleep problems (OR = 12.4, 95% CI = 1.5, 99.6) were the only factors predictive of OSA. Oxygen desaturation index <6 events/h measured by PSG showed an OR of 4.96 (95% CI = 2.27-10.86) for the absence of OSA.
   Conclusions: Children with obesity who undergo PSG are medically complex with multiple sleep concerns including a high burden of daytime symptoms; slightly less than half of children demonstrate polysomnographic features of OSA. Earlier identification of OSA, recognition of non-OSA sleep concerns, and treatment strategies to improve sleep may contribute to overall health outcomes for children with obesity.

ID QUALITY-OF-LIFE; VALIDATION; KOREA; RLS
AB Background: Restless Legs Syndrome has been shown to impact quality of life using standardized scales, typically from tertiary referral centers. Little data exist that have evaluated specific life adaptation required by patients with RLS, and no survey has ever looked at the impact of RLS on family members.
   Methods: The "Patient Odyssey" survey was commissioned by the Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation and designed to assess the day-to-day impact of RLS on patients and their spouses/partners.
   Results: Surveys were completed by 1622 adult patients (70% female), and 676 adult spouses/partners (65% men and 35% women), either online or by mail. RLS markedly impacted patient sleep as well as mitigated travel, work, and mood. Partners also reported impact on their sleep, leisure time, and their relationship with the patient with RLS.
   Conclusion: Despite treatment, RLS continues to impact both subjects and their partners. Impact on the partner/family should also be considered in clinical decision-making. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recognized as the first-choice intervention for insomnia. One of the best-known advantages of CBT-I in comparison with pharmacotherapy is its long-term effect. However, only few studies have assessed its benefits with follow-up periods of longer than three years. In this clinical case series study we aimed to describe the long-term effects of group CBT-I after a mean 7.8 +/- 1.6 years of follow-up (range 4-10 years).
   Methods: A total of 292 insomnia disorder (ID) patients were consecutively enrolled at the Sleep Disorders Center of San Raffaele Hospital, Milan; 123 patients (82 (66.7%) females and 41 (33.3%) males, mean age 40.59 +/- 11.89 years) completed the follow-up evaluation within a range of 4-10 years.
   Results: In the 258 patients who completed the treatment, insomnia severity index (ISI) total score improved significantly as well as all variables of the sleep diaries. Using ISI as the primary outcome, we demonstrated that the effect of CBT-I is maintained up to 10 years after the end of treatment. Furthermore, we found that patients that used only CBT-I techniques to deal with relapses were the ones with better outcomes, in particular compared to the patients that re-used medications.
   Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge this is the longest follow-up evaluation in the literature, both for group and individual CBT-I. These findings have an important clinical implication both suggesting and confirming that CBT-I can be considered the treatment of choice for insomnia. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: At present, epidemiologic studies regarding the relationship between sleep duration and glucose metabolism in adolescents are scarce. The objective was to investigate the association between self-reported nocturnal sleep duration and glycosylated hemoglobin A in 12- to 17-year-old Brazilian adolescents.
   Patients/Methods: A school-based multicenter cross-sectional study was carried out in private and public schools from 273 municipalities with more than 100,000 inhabitants. The final sample comprised 24,923 adolescents. A self-administered questionnaire was used. Blood tests included glucose, insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin A and serum lipids. Age, sex, skin color, school type, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, and Brazilian regions were studied as possible effect modifiers and/or confounders using linear regression.
   Results: A significant positive association was found between more than 12 h of nocturnal sleep and glycosylated hemoglobin A in two Brazilian regions: Southeast and South, even after adjustment for age, sex, skin color, and BMI (coefficients of 0.142 and 0.339, respectively). No association was found with nocturnal sleep duration <7 h.
   Conclusion: Notably, a significant positive relationship was found between more than 12 h of nocturnal sleep duration and glycosylated hemoglobin A in two Brazilian regions. The specific pubertal sleep curtailment can be a compensatory mechanism for dealing with the insulin resistance during adolescence. Those that escape from this regulatory strategy and sleep longer than the adequate duration, break down this balance and tend to damage their glucose metabolism. To our knowledge, this is the first large scale study, of the association between sleep duration and glucose metabolism in adolescents. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) is a diagnostic measure for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) in moderate/high risk patients. Some HSAT companies contain automatic analysis (AA). However, guidelines recommend manual analysis (MA) despite the weak evidence for this recommendation.
   Objective: Evaluate the concordance between AA and MA of HSAT to make either a diagnosis and severity classification.
   Methods: We evaluated AA and MA of HSAT between 2015 and 2016. The study was a blind analysis reviewed by two physicians using currents recommendations. The differences between AA and MA were compared with single variable T analysis, inter-scorer agreement for diagnosis was evaluated with Cohen Kappa coefficient, correlation was examined using Tau-b Kendall, and Bland-Altman plot was constructed to analyze differences between AA and MA.
   Results: One hundred and ninety-eight patients were included. In our study, the mean age was 50 +/- 15 years, 83% male, BMI 30 +/- 5 and neck circumference 41 +/- 4 cm. Eighty-two percent of subjects showed an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > 5 ev/h. Thirty-five percent of patients with OSAHS were mild (AHI: 5 -15 ev/h), 34% moderate and 31% severe (>30 ev/h). The kappa coefficient between physicians was 1.0 (high), between AA and MA was 0.58 (moderate) for the diagnosis of OSAHS and 0.33 (weak) for severity with 0.70 Tau-b. The AA underestimates the IAH -8 ev/h, (95% CI -9 to -7 ev/h, p < 0.001) and delivers a misclassification of severity by 47%.
   Conclusions: AA underestimates the rate of respiratory events and alters the classification of the severity of the disease and may modify the therapeutic approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: As connections between nightmares and various psychiatric disorders have been reported, the clinical significance of studying dream emotionality is now growing in importance. Because the olfactory bulb connects directly to the amygdala odor presentation may be a crucial tool to study dream emotions. Previous studies have demonstrated that presentation of positive/negative odors during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep affects various aspects of dreaming. Although olfactory perception can be influenced by personal experiences, the role of individual preferences in the effects of olfactory stimuli on dreaming has not yet been clarified. The purpose of the current study was to clarify the effects of odor on dreaming during REM sleep, taking individual preferences into account.
   Methods: Phenyl ethyl alcohol (rose-like smell) airflow was presented as an experimental stimulus, and odorless airflow was presented as the control. Participants who like (n = 7) and dislike (n = 8) the odor of phenyl ethyl alcohol were presented air with and without the odor of phenyl ethyl alcohol, respectively, during REM sleep and then awakened to report and rate their dream contents. Thereafter, the transcribed dream reports were rated by independent raters.
   Results and Conclusions: Participants who liked the odor of phenyl ethyl alcohol reported more emotionally negative dreams when they were presented with phenyl ethyl alcohol airflow than that with odorless airflow. In other words, the participant's favorite odor was associated with emotionally negative dreams. These findings could be attributed to the nature of odor perception and the characteristics of brain activities during REM sleep. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: When assessing children's sleep using actigraphy, researchers usually rely on a sleep diary completed by a parent as an aid in scoring actigraphic data. However, parental nonadherence in completing the sleep diary may significantly reduce the amount of available data. The current study examined the agreement between actigraphic data scored with and without a sleep diary to evaluate the impact of not using a sleep diary when studying children's sleep with actigraphy.
   Methods: Sixty children (aged 6-10 years; 36 girls) wore an actigraph for three to seven consecutive nights, and mothers were asked to complete a diary of their child's sleep during the same period. Actigraphy data were scored under two conditions (with and without diary) rated independently for each child by two different research assistants, who each scored 50% of the files in each condition.
   Results: Group-level analyses and intraclass correlations revealed very strong convergence between the two scoring conditions: on all sleep variables (sleep duration, wake duration, and sleep efficiency), average mean differences were very small and intraclass correlations very high. Bland and Altman's (1999) approach allowed for a child-by-child examination of agreement between the two conditions and revealed that, although they cannot be considered interchangeable, the two conditions produce quite minimal differences in the estimation of sleep variables.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that it is possible to use some actigraphy data for which no corresponding diary data are available, although this approach should be used sparingly. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Children's sleep problems are associated with poorer student functioning in the school environment, including impairment in peer relationships; yet, no studies have examined sleep functioning in relation to the student-teacher relationship. The objective of this study was to examine whether child-rated total sleep problems or specific sleep problem domains (bedtime problems, nighttime problems, or daytime sleepiness) were associated with teacher-rated student-teacher closeness and conflict after controlling for student mental health symptoms known to be associated with both greater sleep problems and poorer student-teacher relationship quality. The study also examined whether age moderated the relation between sleep problems and student-teacher relationship quality. Participants: Participants were 175 children (81 boys and 94 girls) in the first to sixth grades (age = 6-13 years) and their teachers.
   Methods: Children completed the Sleep Self-Report. Teachers completed a measure of student mental health symptoms (ie, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and anxiety/depression) and a measure of their relational closeness and conflict with each student.
   Results: Total sleep problems were associated with greater student-teacher conflict, after controlling for child mental health symptoms and demographic factors. This association was moderated by age such that sleep problems were associated with conflict for younger children but not older children. Notably, daytime sleepiness specifically was associated with less student-teacher closeness.
   Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate a relation between student sleep functioning and the student-teacher relationship. Results of the study suggest that sleep may be an important component of school-based screening and evaluation efforts, as sleep is an important malleable factor related to school success.

AB Introduction: Sleepiness and cardiovascular disease share common molecular pathways; thus, genetic risk factors for sleepiness may also predict cardiovascular disease risk. This study explored the associations between subjective sleepiness and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes within oxidative stress, inflammatory, and neuronal pathways, which may contribute to sleepiness and downstream cardiovascular disease risk: Cytochrome B-245, Alpha Polypeptide (CYBA), Cytochrome B-245, Beta Polypeptide (CYBB), Neutrophil Cytosolic Factor (NCF2), Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNFA), and Phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D).
   Methods: Adults (N = 918) from the general population who were a part of the Sao Paulo Epidemiologic Sleep Study (EPISONO) in Sao Paulo, Brazil, were genotyped using Human Omni Express BeadChip array. The average age was 42 +/- 14.5 years, subjects had a mean body mass index (BMI) of 26.9 +/- 5.4 kg/m(2), and 44% were male. Based on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), subjects were classified as having sleepiness (ESS >= 10) or no sleepiness (ESS < 10). Logistic regression models were used to examine the associations with SNPs within candidate genes and sleepiness, adjusting for age, gender, BMI, Apnea -Hypopnea Index (AHI), total sleep time, and ancestry informative principal components (PCs). Complementary analyses using linear regression to assess the relationship between SNPs and continuous ESS were performed.
   Results: We observed a novel association between the C allele of the rs12522161 SNP on PDE4D and a decreased likelihood of sleepiness, controlling for covariates and ancestry [OR (95% CI) = 0.64 (0.50, 0.81); p = 0.0002].
   Conclusion: We present data for a novel genetic association with sleepiness for an SNP on the PDE4D gene, rs12522161. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Can working memory training improve children's sleep?
SO SLEEP MEDICINE
LA English

DE Sleep; Child; Cognitive training; Intervention
ID ADOLESCENTS
AB Background: Improving children's sleep could lead to significant benefits in several functional domains. Recent research in adults suggests that intensive, adaptive cognitive training may be beneficial in improving sleep, although there is limited understanding whether this approach yields similar results in children.
   Objective: To determine whether a working memory training program improved sleep latency, sleep problems, and sleep duration on school and nonschool nights and whether there was a differential effect of the timing of training during the school day on sleep outcomes.
   Design/Methods: Design: Population-based randomised controlled trial. Setting: Forty-four schools in Melbourne, Australia. Participants: All Grade 1 children (mean age = 6.9 years, SD 0.4) underwent WM screening using two subtests from the Automated Working Memory Assessment. Children with low verbal and/or visuo-spatial WM scores relative to their peers ('low WM', similar to 25%) were randomised to intervention or control arms. Intervention: 20 to 25 computerised 25-min training sessions were conducted using the CogMed program, over 5-7 weeks at school. Outcomes: Parent-reported child sleep characteristics (time, latency, duration and problem) at 6 months post randomisation.
   Results: A total of 452 (26.0%) of 1723 children screened (64.1% of approached) met trial eligibility criteria, with 226 in each study arm. Of intervention children, 91% completed the minimum 20 days of training. Retention was 90.5% at 6 months. Adjusted regressions showed that intervention children did not have better sleep latency, duration, bedtime consistency or less sleep problems.
   Conclusion: It does not appear that adaptive working memory training during the school day can be used as a novel approach to improve children's sleep attributes up to 6 months post-randomisation, regardless of the time of day training is delivered. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We examined the extent to which and why early career transitions have led to women being underrepresented among faculty in the life sciences. We followed the careers of 6,336 scientists from the post-doctoral fellowship stage to becoming a principal investigator (PI) - a critical transition in the academic life sciences. Using a unique dataset that connects individuals' National Institutes of Health funding histories to their publication records, we found that a large portion of the overall gender gap in the life sciences emerges at this transition. Women become PIs at a 20% lower rate than men. Differences in "productivity" (publication records) can explain about 60% of this differential. The remaining portion appears to stem from gender differences in the returns to similar publication records, with women receiving less credit for their citations.

AB The main goal of this paper is to analyse the single and joint impact of regulation policies and research network policies on environmental innovation. Our theoretical framework combines the open eco-innovation mode approach with the Porter Hypothesis, by adapting them to the knowledge production function where green patents are the dependent variable. We focus on the factors that influence the production of green patents as a proxy of new "environmental" knowledge for a panel of European countries over time. We find that both marked-based regulation policies and participation in green European research networks (in particular with universities and public research centres) positively affect environmental innovation. Moreover, the two policy tools have a complementary effect. This suggests that the effectiveness of environmental regulation policies can be increased by combining them with appropriate innovation policies.

AB Industrial society has not only led to high levels of wealth and welfare in the Western world, but also to increasing global ecological degradation and social inequality. The socio-technical systems that underlay contemporary societies have substantially contributed to these outcomes. This paper proposes that these sociotechnical systems are an expression of a limited number of meta-rules that, for the past 250 years, have driven innovation and hence system evolution in a particular direction, thereby constituting the First Deep Transition. Meeting the cumulative social and ecological consequences of the overall direction of the First Deep Transition would require a radical change, not only in socio-technical systems but also in the meta-rules driving their evolution - the Second Deep Transition. This paper develops a new theoretical framework that aims to explain the emergence, acceleration, stabilization and directionality of Deep Transitions. It does so through the synthesis of two literatures that have attempted to explain large-scale and long-term socio-technical change: the Multilevel Perspective (MLP) on socio-technical transitions, and Techno-economic Paradigm (TEP) framework.

AB As university involvement in technology transfer and entrepreneurship has increased, concerns over the patenting and licensing of scientific discoveries have grown. This paper examines the effect that the licensing of academic patents has on journal citations to academic publications covering the same scientific research. We analyze data on invention disclosures, patents, and licenses from the University of California, a leading U.S. academic patenter and licensor, between 1997 and 2007. We also develop a novel "inventor-based" maximum-likelihood matching technique to automate and generalize Murray's (2002) "patent-paper pairs" methodology. We use this methodology to identify the scientific publications associated with University of California patents and licenses.
   Based on a "difference-in-differences" analysis, we find that within our sample of patented academic discoveries, citations to licensed patent-linked publications are higher in the three years after the license, although this difference is not statistically significant. We then disaggregate our sample into (a) patented discoveries that are likely to be used as "research tools" by other researchers (based on the presence of material transfer agreements (MTAs) that cover them) and (b) patented discoveries not covered by MTAs. Citations to publications linked to licensed patents in the latter subset (not covered by MTAs) are higher for publications linked to licensed patents, and this difference is statistically significant. In contrast, licensing of patented discoveries that are also research tools is associated with a reduction in citations to papers linked to these research advances, raising the possibility that licensing may restrict the flow of inputs to "follow-on" scientific research.

AB In many countries the scientific funding system is shifting from an internal block funding model toward a competitive project funding model. However, there is growing concern that the competitive project funding system favors relatively safe, conventional projects at the expense of risky, novel research. It is important to assess different funding models in order to design better funding systems for science. This paper empirically tests for differences in the novelty of funded outputs between internal block funding and competitive project funding, in the setting of Japan, where both funding models play a significant role. Combining survey data from a large sample of research projects in Japan and bibliometric information about the publications produced from these projects, we find that projects funded by competitive funds on average have higher novelty compared to those funded by internal block funds. However, such positive effects only hold for researchers with high status, such as senior and male researchers. In contrast, compared to internal block funding, competitive project funding has a negative relation to novelty for low status scientists (especially junior and female researchers). The findings suggest that the competitive project selection procedure is less receptive to novel ideas from researchers with low academic status and therefore discourages their novel research. These findings can serve as a warning about potential biases in competitive funding allocation procedures and suggest the importance of secure stable funding for allowing researchers with low status to pursue their novel ideas.

AB Despite numerous studies on modularity, the modularization processes have received less attention. In the global context, product modularity can be leveraged to satisfy heterogeneous market requirements across countries with low costs. Through a longitudinal case study of HomeTech, we examined how multinational R&D created an effective organizational interface to facilitate recombination of its organizational units, and thus product modularization. We found that three elements of an organizational interface were established through a process composed of three phases in HomeTech R&D: regional concentration, establishing a module pool, and creating architecture leader posts. We also found that the three elements exerted the balancing effect and the brokerage effect so that the organizational interface was effective in facilitating recombination of organizational units. We contribute to the literature through showing how organizational modularity can affect product modularity within a firm. We also reveal the critical role of architecture leaders in product modularization. Finally, we enrich the organizational interface concept by highlighting the combination of elements.

AB This paper augments the technological innovation systems (TIS) framework to provide policy guidance on how to manage interactions between a core technology and its larger sectoral context. A TIS development cycle is presented that combines the TIS framework's ability to clearly illuminate policy gaps with Erik Dahmen's idea that technological diffusion creates structural tensions that introduce transformation pressure. This pressure can result in stagnation and unrealized development potential or spur sectoral complementarities and the evolution of a TIS into a larger "development block" of interlinked technological systems. Integrating structural tensions into TIS analysis highlights how the evolution of a focal technology induces technological complementarities and creates a need to continuously re-design policies. This underscores the continued benefit of a technology system perspective, even as a technology matures.
   The revised TIS framework is applied to a case study of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia that explores how variable renewable electricity diffusion introduces structural tensions with existing electricity grids, requiring the use of complementary technologies that add storage and flexibility. Nova Scotia aggressively developed wind energy and built a high-voltage direct-current transmission line to import hydroelectricity that could back-up variable renewable energy sources like wind.

A comparative case study among five High Tech (HT) companies In the Netherlands uncovers the motivations for adopting certain contracts over others. The findings illustrate that contracts discussed in the literature (sales-rebate, buy back, revenue sharing, etc.) successfully work for commercial agreements but not at all for coordinating joint innovation projects. Motivations for adopting these contracts do not limit to general company characteristics but also stretch from historical reasons to future strategies. The findings help HT companies to setting up the basis of a contract to coordinate joint innovation projects within SCs.

AB Radiation hydrodynamics simulations based on a single fluid two-temperature model may violate the law of energy conservation, because the governing equations are expressed in a nonconservative formulation. In this study, we maintain the important physical requirements by employing a strategy based on the key concept that mathematical structures associated with conservative and nonconservative equations are preserved, even at the discrete level. To this end, we discretize the conservation laws and transform them using exact algebraic operations. The proposed scheme maintains global conservation errors within the round-off level. In addition, a numerical experiment concerning the shock tube problem suggests that the proposed scheme agrees well with the jump conditions at the discontinuities regulated by the Rankine-Hugoniot relationship. The generalized derivation allows us to employ arbitrary central difference, artificial dissipation, and Runge-Kutta methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present an analytical study of discretization stencils for the Poisson problem and the incompressible Navier-Stokes problem when used with some direct forcing immersed boundary methods. This study uses, but is not limited to, second-order discretization and Ghost-Cell Finite-Difference methods. We show that the stencil size increases with the aspect ratio of rectangular cells, which is undesirable as it breaks assumptions of some linear system solvers. To circumvent this drawback, a modification of the Ghost-Cell Finite-Difference methods is proposed to reduce the size of the discretization stencil to the one observed for square cells, i.e. with an aspect ratio equal to one. Numerical results validate this proposed method in terms of accuracy and convergence, for the Poisson problem and both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. An improvement on error levels is also observed. In addition, we show that the application of the chosen Ghost-Cell Finite-Difference methods to the Navier-Stokes problem, discretized by a pressure-correction method, requires an additional interpolation step. This extra step is implemented and validated through well known test cases of the Navier-Stokes equations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The coupled equations of Biot's poroelasticity, consisting of stress equilibrium and fluid mass balance in deforming porous media, are numerically solved. The governing partial differential equations are discretized by an Element-based Finite Volume Method (EbFVM), which can be used in three dimensional unstructured grids composed of elements of different types. One of the difficulties for solving these equations is the numerical pressure instability that can arise when undrained conditions take place. In this paper, a stabilization technique is developed to overcome this problem by employing an interpolation function for displacements that considers also the pressure gradient effect. The interpolation function is obtained by the so-called Physical Influence Scheme (PIS), typically employed for solving incompressible fluid flows governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. Classical problems with analytical solutions, as well as three-dimensional realistic cases are addressed. The results reveal that the proposed stabilization technique is able to eliminate the spurious pressure instabilities arising under undrained conditions at a low computational cost.

AB We consider a class of tumor growth models under the combined effects of density-dependent pressure and cell multiplication, with a free boundary model as its singular limit when the pressure-density relationship becomes highly nonlinear. In particular, the constitutive law connecting pressure p and density rho is p(rho) = m/m-1 rho(m-1), and when m >> 1, the cell density rho may evolve its support according to a pressure-driven geometric motion with sharp interface along its boundary. The nonlinearity and degeneracy in the diffusion bring great challenges in numerical simulations. Prior to the present paper, there is lack of standard mechanism to numerically capture the front propagation speed as m >> 1. In this paper, we develop a numerical scheme based on a novel prediction-correction reformulation that can accurately approximate the front propagation even when the nonlinearity is extremely strong. We show that the semi-discrete scheme naturally connects to the free boundary limit equation as m -> infinity. With proper spatial discretization, the fully discrete scheme has improved stability, preserves positivity, and can be implemented without nonlinear solvers. Finally, extensive numerical examples in both one and two dimensions are provided to verify the claimed properties in various applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Well-posedness and stability are analysed for continuous and discrete problems using both strong and weak formulations, and a general transmission condition is obtained. The theory is applied to the coupling of fluid-acoustic models, multi-grid implementations, adaptive mesh refinements, multi-block formulations and numerical filtering. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Recently, an algorithm for coupling a Finite Volume (FV) method, that discretize the Navier-Stokes equations on block structured Eulerian grids, with the weakly-compressible Lagrangian Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) was presented in [16]. The algorithm takes advantage of the SPH method to discretize flow regions close to free-surfaces and of the FV method to resolve the bulk flow and the wall regions. The continuity between the two solutions is guaranteed by overlapping zones. Here we extend the algorithm by adding the possibility to have: 1) net mass transfer between the SPH and FV sub-domains; 2) free-surface across the overlapping region. In this context, particle generation at common boundaries is required to prevent depletion or clustering of particles. This operation is not trivial, because consistency between the Lagrangian and Eulerian description of the flow must be retained to ensure mass conservation. We propose here a new coupling paradigm that extends the algorithm developed in [16] and renders it suitable to test cases where vorticity and free surface significantly pass from one domain to the other. On the SPH side, a novel technique for the creation/deletion of particle was developed. On the FV side, the information recovered from the SPH solver are exploited to improve free surface prediction in a fashion that resemble the Particle Level-Set algorithms. The combination of the two new features was tested and validated in a number of test cases where both vorticity and front evolution are important. Convergence and robustness of the algorithm are shown. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The integrators exactly preserve energy and have arbitrarily high order. It is shown that the proposed approach allows us to obtain the energy-preserving methods derived in [12] by Cohen and Hairer (2011) and in [1] by Brugnano et al. (2012) for Poisson systems. Furthermore, we study the sufficient conditions that ensure the existence of a unique solution and discuss the order of the new energy-preserving integrators. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

   SYSTEMS; LAWS; APPROXIMATIONS
AB The Sjogreen and Yee [31] high order entropy conservative numerical method for compressible gas dynamics is extended to include discontinuities and also extended to equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The basic idea is based on Tadmor's [40] original work for inviscid perfect gas flows. For the MHD four formulations of the MHD are considered: (a) the conservative MHD, (b) the Godunov [14] non-conservative form, (c) the Janhunen [19] - MHD with magnetic field source terms, and (d) a MHD with source terms by Brackbill and Barnes [5]. Three forms of the high order entropy numerical fluxes for the MHD in the finite difference framework are constructed. They are based on the extension of the low order form of Chandrashekar and Klingenberg [9], and two forms with modifications of the Winters and Gassner [49] numerical fluxes. For flows containing discontinuities and multiscale turbulence fluctuations the high order entropy conservative numerical fluxes as the new base scheme under the Yee and Sjogreen [31] and Kotov et al. [21,22] high order nonlinear filter approach is developed. The added nonlinear filter step on the high order centered entropy conservative spatial base scheme is only utilized at isolated computational regions, while maintaining high accuracy almost everywhere for long time integration of unsteady flows and DNS and LES of turbulence computations. Representative test cases for both smooth flows and problems containing discontinuities for the gas dynamics and the ideal MHD are included. The results illustrate the improved stability by using the high order entropy conservative numerical flux as the base scheme instead of the pure high order central scheme. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB We present a dimensionally split method for solving hyperbolic conservation laws on Cartesian cut cell meshes. The approach combines local geometric and wave speed information to determine a novel stabilised cut cell flux, and we provide a full description of its three-dimensional implementation in the dimensionally split framework of Klein et al. [1]. The convergence and stability of the method are proved for the one-dimensional linear advection equation, while its multi-dimensional numerical performance is investigated through the computation of solutions to a number of test problems for the linear advection and Euler equations. When compared to the cut cell flux of Klein et al., it was found that the new flux alleviates the problem of oscillatory boundary solutions produced by the former at higher Courant numbers, and also enables the computation of more accurate solutions near stagnation points. Being dimensionally split, the method is simple to implement and extends readily to multiple dimensions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We propose an extension of the discretization approaches for multilayer shallow water models, aimed at making them more flexible and efficient for realistic applications to coastal flows. A novel discretization approach is proposed, in which the number of vertical layers and their distribution are allowed to change in different regions of the computational domain. Furthermore, semi-implicit schemes are employed for the time discretization, leading to a significant efficiency improvement for subcritical regimes. We show that, in the typical regimes in which the application of multilayer shallow water models is justified, the resulting discretization does not introduce any major spurious feature and allows again to reduce substantially the computational cost in areas with complex bathymetry. As an example of the potential of the proposed technique, an application to a sediment transport problem is presented, showing a remarkable improvement with respect to standard discretization approaches.

AB The goal of this work is to develop a novel splitting approach for the numerical solution of multiscale problems involving the coupling between Stokes equations and ODE systems, as often encountered in blood flow modeling applications. The proposed algorithm is based on a semi-discretization in time based on operator splitting, whose design is guided by the rationale of ensuring that the physical energy balance is maintained at the discrete level. As a result, unconditional stability with respect to the time step choice is ensured by the implicit treatment of interface conditions within the Stokes substeps, whereas the coupling between Stokes and ODE substeps is enforced via appropriate initial conditions for each substep. Notably, unconditional stability is attained without the need of subiterating between Stokes and ODE substeps. Stability and convergence properties of the proposed algorithm are tested on three specific examples for which analytical solutions are derived. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we extended the analytical level set method [1,2] for identifying a piece-wisely heterogeneous (zonation) binary system to the case with an arbitrary number of materials with unknown material properties. In the developed level set approach, starting from an initial guess, the material interfaces are propagated through iterations such that the residuals between the simulated and observed state variables (hydraulic head) is minimized. We derived an expression for the propagation velocity of the interface between any two materials, which is related to the permeability contrast between the materials on two sides of the interface, the sensitivity of the head to permeability, and the head residual. We also formulated an expression for updating the permeability of all materials, which is consistent with the steepest descent of the objective function. The developed approach has been demonstrated through many examples, ranging from totally synthetic cases to a case where the flow conditions are representative of a groundwater contaminant site at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. These examples indicate that the level set method can successfully identify zonation structures, even if the number of materials in the model domain is not exactly known in advance. Although the evolution of the material zonation depends on the initial guess field, inverse modeling runs starting with different initial guesses fields may converge to the similar final zonation structure. These examples also suggest that identifying interfaces of spatially distributed heterogeneities is more important than estimating their permeability values. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This article is devoted to the design of importance sampling method for the Monte Carlo simulation of a linear transport equation. This model is of great importance in the simulation of inertial confinement fusion experiments. Our method is restricted to a spherically symmetric idealized design: an outer sphere emitting radiation towards an inner sphere, which in practice should be thought of as the hohlraum and the fusion capsule, respectively. We compute the importance function as the solution of the corresponding stationary adjoint problem. Doing so, we have an important reduction of the variance (by a factor 50 to 100), with a moderate increase of computational cost (by a factor 2 to 8). (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Maxwell's equations are discretized on a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice instead of a simple cubic as an alternative to the standard Yee method for improvements in numerical dispersion characteristics and grid isotropy of the method. Explicit update equations and numerical dispersion expressions, and the stability criteria are derived. Also, several tools available to the standard Yee method such as PEC/PMC boundary conditions, absorbing boundary conditions, and scattered field formulation are extended to this method as well. A comparison between the FCC and the Yee formulations is made, showing that the FCC method exhibits better dispersion compared to its Yee counterpart. Simulations are provided to demonstrate both the accuracy and grid isotropy improvement of the method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Generalized eigenvalue problems are standard problems in computational sciences. They may arise in electromagnetic fields from the discretization of the Helmholtz equation by for example the finite element method (FEM). Geometrical perturbations of the structure under concern lead to a new generalized eigenvalue problems with different system matrices. Geometrical perturbations may arise by manufacturing tolerances, harsh operating conditions or during shape optimization. Directly solving the eigenvalue problem for each perturbation is computationally costly. The perturbed eigenpairs can be approximated using eigenpair derivatives. Two common approaches for the calculation of eigenpair derivatives, namely modal superposition method and direct algebraic methods, are discussed in this paper. Based on the direct algebraic methods an iterative algorithm is developed for efficiently calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the perturbed geometry from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the unperturbed geometry.

AB Accurate evaluation of layer potentials is crucial when boundary integral equation methods are used to solve partial differential equations. Quadrature by expansion (QBX) is a recently introduced method that can offer high accuracy for singular and nearly singular integrals, using truncated expansions to locally represent the potential. The QBX method is typically based on a spherical harmonics expansion which when truncated at order p has O(p(2)) terms. This expansion can equivalently be written with p terms, however paying the price that the expansion coefficients will depend on the evaluation/target point. Based on this observation, we develop a target specific QBX method, and apply it to Laplace's equation on multiply-connected domains. The method is local in that the QBX expansions only involve information from a neighborhood of the target point. An analysis of the truncation error in the QBX expansions is presented, practical parameter choices are discussed and the method is validated and tested on various problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ID STOCHASTIC COLLOCATION METHOD; GEOMETRY
AB This paper addresses uncertainty quantification (UQ) for problems where scalar (or low-dimensional vector) response quantities are insufficient and, instead, full-field (very high-dimensional) responses are of interest. To do so, an adaptive stochastic simulation-based methodology is introduced that refines the probability space based on Grassmann manifold variations. The proposed method has a multi-element character discretizing the probability space into simplex elements using a Delaunay triangulation. For every simplex, the high-dimensional solutions corresponding to its vertices (sample points) are projected onto the Grassmann manifold. The pairwise distances between these points are calculated using appropriately defined metrics and the elements with large total distance are sub-sampled and refined. As a result, regions of the probability space that produce significant changes in the full-field solution are accurately resolved. An added benefit is that an approximation of the solution within each element can be obtained by interpolation on the Grassmann manifold. The method is applied to study the probability of shear band formation in a bulk metallic glass using the shear transformation zone theory. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The paper presents two contributions in the context of the numerical simulation of magnetized fluid dynamics. First, we show how to extend the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations with an inbuilt magnetic field divergence cleaning mechanism in such a way that the resulting model is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics. As a byproduct of these derivations, we show that not all of the commonly used divergence cleaning extensions of the ideal MHD equations are thermodynamically consistent. Secondly, we present a numerical scheme obtained by constructing a specific finite volume discretization that is consistent with the discrete thermodynamic entropy. It includes a mechanism to control the discrete divergence error of the magnetic field by construction and is Galilean invariant. We implement the new high-order MHD solver in the adaptive mesh refinement code FLASH where we compare the divergence cleaning efficiency to the constrained transport solver available in FLASH (unsplit staggered mesh scheme).

AB An energy-based theory of the glass transition is described and validated by evaluation of crystallization and viscosity data of sixteen diverse systems, ranging from the fragile o-terphenyl to the strong SiO2 glass formers, including glass formation in non-crystallizing polymers. Transition zone theory demonstrates an inverse temperature dependence of the entropy of activation for crystallization and viscous relaxation which results in a temperature at which their free energies of activation are equivalent. Below this temperature there is a greater probability of crystallization than of relaxation, Under such conditions, crystal-like organization can propagate only over the internal length scales for which the system has relaxed, i.e. a few nanometers. However, that structural organization makes the barrier to bulk liquid relaxation insurmountable, resulting in glass formation. The temperature of the crystallization-relaxation free energy of activation equivalence point, defines the glass transition temperature, The temperature dependent slope of the free energy of activation for relaxation at the equivalence point reflects the fragility of the system. The time-temperature dependence of viscous relaxation shifts the crystallization-relaxation free energy of activation equivalence point, consistent with the sample history dependence of T-g. Crystal-like formation over nanometer-length scales, which can still occur below T-g, is shown to account for glass aging.

AB Degradation behavior of methyl orange and direct blue 6 azo dyes catalyzed by Fe76Si9B10P5 amorphous powders and graphene oxide (GO) addition composites has been investigated. The results revealed that the Fe76Si9B10P5 amorphous powders are more effective to degrade azo dyes than the commercial Fe powders with the activity energies of 24.2 kJ mol(-1) and 20.4 kJ mol(-1) for the degradation of methyl orange and direct blue 6 azo dye solutions. The addition of GO into the amorphous powders further improves the degradation activity, accompanied with lower activation energies of 18.3 kJ mol(-1) and 16.7 kJ mol(-1). High degradation performance of Fe-Si-B-P amorphous powders was attributed to the amorphous structure in metastable state and the existence of metalloids which are beneficial to the formation of a surface layer with high activity. The addition of GO accelerates the degradation process due to its high surface area and the existence of large number of functional groups.

AB The inherent brittleness and poor crack resistance of oxide glasses have always been among their main limitations for many advanced applications. As the formation of cracks leads to amplification of applied tensile stresses and ultimately catastrophic failure, there is an interest in understanding the compositional and structural dependence of crack initiation and growth. The resistance to cracking can conventionally be measured using instrumented indentation that mimics the real-life damage for certain applications. Wada introduced a method to evaluate the crack resistance by counting the number of initiated cracks as a function of the applied load. Experiments have shown that the environmental humidity and the time period between indentation and crack counting both affect the crack resistance value, but unfortunately these parameters are not always reported in literature studies. Here we perform a systematic study of the time and humidity dependence of crack initiation in calcium aluminosilicate glasses. Depending on the experimental conditions (time and humidity), the crack resistance of an aluminosilicate glass can vary by more than a factor of two. Furthermore, the observed radial/median cracks can initiate several hours after indentation. These results therefore indicate the need for a standardized procedure for determination of crack resistance to allow comparison of data from different research groups. We suggest including a sufficiently long waiting period (such as 24 h) between indentation and crack counting, as the majority of the crack initiation will then have occurred.

AB In this paper, the structure and chemical durability of calcium aluminophosphate glasses, containing rare earth oxides (La2O3 and CeO2), was investigated. The glasses were prepared and melted an electric furnace at temperatures ranging from 1350 to 1370 degrees C for 2-3 h; the produced glasses were examined by XRD, FTIR and SEM. Results from FTIR demonstrated that with more rare-earth oxides doped, the glass network depolymerized and the chains of phosphate in Q(2) units depolymerized to the other kinds of phosphate groups, Q(1) and Q(0). XRD analysis confirmed that the surfaces of all the glass specimens after corrosion were amorphous. Densities of all glass specimens displayed an increased tendency with larger concentration of La2O3 or CeO2. As for the chemical durability, more and more cracks emerged on the glass surfaces after the alkali corrosion, and the La-doped glass specimens were more susceptible to corrosion than that of Ce-doped. The weight loss of different glasses in water and alkali solutions was measured. Comparing with the two groups, Ce-doped glass, which the weight loss rate was 9.36% when the amount of cerium oxide doped was 2.5 mol%, had a significant impact on water and alkali resistance than La-doped.

AB The elastic-plastic deformation in raw and ion-exchanged aluminosilicate glass is investigated by loading rate dependent nanoindentation. The nanohardness and Young's modulus of the raw and ion-exchanged glasses at different loading rate (100-20,000 mu N.s(-1)) are explored up to a maximum load of 9000 mu N. The nanoindentations are scanned with AFM to observe the morphology of the indents. The results show that Young's modulus of the aluminosilicate glass increases after ion exchange and that the nanohardness of the raw and ion exchanged aluminosilicate glass increases linearly with the loading rate, when plotted on a double logarithmic axes. However, the nanohardness of the raw glass is more sensitive to the variation of loading rate. The compressive stress on the ion-exchanged glass can inhibit plastic deformation. These results are explained in terms of shear stress underneath the indenter and the number of the flow lines in the nanoindentations. These findings are useful for better understanding the dynamic contact-induced damage growth mechanisms of ion-exchanged glass.

AB Rock and glass wool fiber reinforced phenol-formaldehyde monolithic composite aerogels (PF/RWF and PF/GWF, respectively) were prepared using solvent saturated sol gel and impregnation of fibers by initial PF sol. The composite wet gels were dried by using ambient-pressure drying technique. After it, synthesized polymeric aerogels were transformed to rock and glass wool fiber reinforced monolithic carbon composite aerogels (C/RWF and C/GWF) through carbonization at 850 degrees C. The effect of fiber concentration on the physical and morphological properties of both types of composite aerogels was evaluated. The SEM analysis was also conducted to understand the microstructural changes during the carbonization step. Compressive stress-strain behavior of polymeric and carbon composite aerogels changed drastically by addition of fibers. The Young's modulus of polymeric and carbon composite aerogels increased by increasing of fibers concentration in the aerogel structure and showed a yield stress. The compressive strength of carbon composite aerogels was decreased with respect to the formation of voids and cracks around the fibers through the pyrolysis step. The degradation kinetic parameters of polymeric composite aerogels were evaluated using characteristic kinetic temperature-characteristic kinetic temperature range model (CKT-CKTR). The results showed the higher performance of rock wool fibers to thermal stability enhancement of PF aerogels. By 2.5 wt% wool fibers content, the maximum oxidation rate temperature increased from 594 degrees C for carbon aerogel to about 620 and 643 degrees C for C/RWF and C/GWF composite aerogels, respectively. The effect of rock wool fibers on the improvement of thermal oxidation resistance of samples was stronger than glass wool fibers.

AB Mesoporous bioactive silicate-based glasses in the system of (38-x)CaO-xZnO-58SiO(2)-4P(2)O(5) (mol.%), where x varies between 0 and 20, have been prepared by the sol-gel method. The influence of zinc addition on glass physicochemical properties, degradability and apatite-formation ability was comprehensively investigated. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption results confirmed the glasses mesoporous structure. The degradability of glass was studied in Tris-HCl, the addition of zinc would lead to a decrease. Furthermore, the glass apatite-formation ability was assessed by immersion of samples in simulated body fluid (SBF) solution for up to 7 days. The changes in glass surface morphology and composition were detected using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). It was observed that the apatite precipitation rate slowed down with the increase of zinc, suggesting that the incorporation of zinc could be a promising route to regulate the dissolution and apatite formation of silicate-based glasses.

AB The influence of casting temperature on the compressive plasticity of Zr56Co24Ag4Al16 and Zr56Co22Cu6Al16 bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) fabricated via copper mold suction casting was studied through the varying electric discharge current, including (100%, 90%, 80% and 70%). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to investigate the glassy alloys structure. In addition, the compression test, microhardness test, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were utilized to discuss the possible mechanisms involved in the enhanced plasticity achievement. The results demonstrated that the samples subjected to the 80% casting current exhibit the highest compressive plasticity. The plastic strain increased dramatically from 4% to 10.7% for the Ag-containing samples and from 5.7% to 12% for the Cu-containing samples as the casting current decreased from 100% to 80%, and then the plastic strain decreased to 8.4% for the Ag-containing sample and to 9.4% for the Cu-containing sample at 70% of the casting current. The effect of casting temperature on the mechanical properties was explored by focusing mainly upon the effects of structure evolution such as those of free-volume content variations.

Increasing the Nb2O5 content decreased the glass transition and softening temperatures. Thermal stability increased with Nb2O5 addition and it was higher for glasses based on the composition having the highest SiO2 content. The thermal expansion coefficient tended to increase with the Nb2O5 amount. Zinc borate and zinc niobate were identified in glasses containing Nb2O5 <= 5 mol%, however in glasses based on the highest SiO2 composition, an additional crystalline phase, willemite, was detected. At the highest Nb2O5 additions, willemite formation was suppressed and zinc niobate plus zinc borate were detected. The non-isothermal crystallization kinetics was investigated, and the effect of Nb2O5 addition and of the base glass composition on the crystallization activation energy and crystallization mechanism was discussed.

AB A Ni60Nb40 alloy was vitrified from fcc Ni and bcc Nb by cold rolling and by rapid solidification of an alloy ingot. The Ni60Nb40 that was vitrified by rolling has a lower crystallization onset temperature with single crystallization reaction compared to the two-stage crystallization at higher temperature for quenched Ni(60)elsib(40). Fluctuation electron microscopy and hybrid reverse Monte Carlo modeling show that the as-rolled Ni60Nb40 contains fewer icosahedral-like Voronoi clusters and more crystal-like and bcc-like Voronoi clusters, which are inherited from the bcc Nb. The crystal-like and bcc-like medium range order clusters may be the structural origin for lower crystallization temperature in the as-rolled glass. It is demonstrated that hybrid reverse Monte Carlo simulations incorporating fluctuation microscopy and an empirical interatomic potential are insensitive to the starting structure.

AB Zirconia-containing soda-lime silicate glasses with compositions of xZrO(2)-(75-x)SiO2-15Na(2)O-10CaO, where x = 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7, were studied using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to understand the effect of ZrO2/SiO2 substitution on the short-, medium-range glass structures, and properties such as ionic diffusion and mechanical behaviors of these glasses. Local environments of Zr4+ and other cations such as bond distance and cation-oxygen coordination number as a function of composition were systematically analyzed from pair distribution function and bond angle distribution calculations. It was found that Zr-O bond distance is around 2.12 angstrom and zirconium coordination number is around 6, forming slightly distorted [ZrO6] octahedron, with both showing little changes with composition. Silicon maintains perfectly four-fold coordinated with a Si-O bond distance of 1.61 angstrom throughout the glass series. Medium-range structural information (e.g., Q(n) distribution, network connectivity and polyhedral linkages) was also studied as a function of ZrO2 substitution. It was found that [ZrO6] enters the glass-forming network through corner-sharing with [SiO4]. Both Na+ and Ca2+ act as charge compensators of [ZrO6] with slightly higher preference of the latter. Addition of zirconia was found to impact the properties of the glasses: it increases both the low and high temperature diffusion energy barriers of modifier cations and increases the elastic moduli of the glasses. These changes of properties can be explained by the enhanced glass network due to zirconia incorporation.

AB Since alcohol and tobacco consumption are among the leading causes of population health harm, it is very important to understand the consumption behaviour to develop effective harm reduction strategies. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a potential tool for estimating their consumption, but there are several uncertainties that need to be determined, including the stability of biomarkers in the sewer. Utilizing a real rising main sewer, this study investigated the stability of alcohol and tobacco consumption biomarkers. Rhodamine and acesulfame were used as flow tracer and benchmarker to understand the transportation of wastewater in the sewer with a hydraulic retention time between 2.7 and 5.0 h. Ethyl sulphate (EtS) and ethyl glucuronide (EtG), two biomarkers of alcohol consumption, were found to have different in-sewer stability, with EtS much more stable than EtG. The degradation rate of EtS is approximately 8% per hour, while EtG has a half-life of 1.9 h. Formation of nicotine, cotinine and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine, three biomarkers for tobacco consumption, was observed during the experiment, probably due to deconjugation of their glucuronide chemicals. The deconjugation process has prevented the determination of actual stability of the three chemicals However, it is suggested that cotinine is relatively stable, while nicotine and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine degrade to a certain degree in the sewer system. According to our findings, the in-sewer degradation is more important during the interpretation of alcohol consumption estimation than for tobacco consumption estimation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB While slow sand filters (SSFs) have produced drinking water for more than a hundred years, understanding of their associated microbial communities is limited. In this study, bacteria in influent and effluent water from full-scale SSFs were explored using flow cytometry (FCM) with cytometric histogram image comparison (CHIC) analysis; and routine microbial counts for heterotrophs, total coliforms and Escherichia coli. To assess if FCM can monitor biofilm function, SSFs differing in age and sand composition were compared. FCM profiles from two established filters were indistinguishable. To examine biofilm in the deep sand bed, SSFs were monitored during a scraping event, when the top layer of sand and the schmutzdecke are removed to restore flow through the filter. The performance of an established SSF was stable: total organic carbon (TOC), pH, numbers of heterotrophs, coliforms, E. coli, and FCM bacterial profile were unaffected by scraping. However, the performance of two newly-built SSFs containing new and mixed sand was compromised: breakthrough of both microbial indicators and TOC occurred following scraping. The compromised performance of the new SSFs was reflected in distinct effluent bacterial communities; and, the presence of microbial indicators correlated to influent bacterial communities. This demonstrated that FCM can monitor SSF performance. Removal of the top layer of sand did not alter the effluent water from the established SSF, but did affect that of the SSFs containing new sand. This suggests that the impact of the surface biofilm on effluent water is greater when the deep sand bed biofilm is not established. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ozonation, sorption to granular activated carbon and aerobic degradation were compared as potential treatment methods for removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fractions and selected organic compounds from shale gas flowback water after pre-treatment in dissolved air flotation unit Flowback water was characterised by high chemical oxygen demand and DOC. Low molecular weight (LMW) acids and neutral compounds were the most abundant organic fractions, corresponding to 47% and 35% of DOC respectively. Ozonation did not change distribution of organic carbon fractions and concentrations of detected individual organic compounds significantly. Sorption to activated carbon targeted removal of individual organic compounds with molecular weight >115 Da, whereas LMW compounds remained largely unaffected. Aerobic degradation was responsible for removal of LMW compounds and partial ammonium removal, whereas formation of intermediates with molecular weight of 200-350 Da was observed. Combination of aerobic degradation for LMW organics removal with adsorption to activated carbon for removal of non-biodegradable organics is proposed to be implemented between pretreatment (dissolved air floatation) and desalination (thermal or membrane desalination) steps.

AB The xenobiotic priority pollutant pentachlorophenol has been used as a timber preservative in a polychlorophenol bulk synthesis product containing also tetrachlorophenol and trichlorophenol. Highly soluble chlorophenol salts have leaked into groundwater, causing severe contamination of large aquifers. Natural attenuation of higher-chlorinated phenols (HCPs: pentachlorophenol + tetrachlorophenol) at historically polluted sites has been inefficient, but a 4-year full scale in situ biostimulation of a chlorophenol-contaminated aquifer by circulation and re-infiltration of aerated groundwater was remarkably successful: pentachlorophenol decreased from 400 mu gL(-1) to <l mu gL(-1) and tetrachlorophenols from 4000 mu gL(-1) to <10 mu gL(-1). The pcpB gene, the gene encoding pentachlorophenol hydroxylase - the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the only fully characterised aerobic HCP degradation pathway - was present in up to 10% of the indigenous bacteria already 4 months after the start of aeration. The novel quantitative PCR assay detected the pcpB gene in situ also in the chlorophenol plume of another historically polluted aquifer with no remediation history. Hotspot groundwater HCPs from this site were degraded efficiently during a 3-week microcosm incubation with one-time aeration but no other additives, from 5400 mu gL(-1) to 1200 mu gL(-1) and to 200 mu gL(-1) in lightly and fully aerated microcosms, respectively, coupled with up to 2400% enrichment of the pcpB gene. Accumulation of lowerchlorinated metabolites was observed in neither in situ remediation nor microcosms, supporting the assumption that HCP removal was due to the aerobic degradation pathway where the first step limits the mineralisation rate. Our results demonstrate that bacteria capable of aerobic mineralisation of xenobiotic pentachlorophenol and tetrachlorophenol can be present at long-term polluted groundwater sites, making bioremediation by simple aeration a viable and economically attractive alternative.

AB Silver impregnated activated carbon (SIAC) has been found to be effective in mitigating the formation of brominated-disinfection by products during drinking water treatment. However, there are still uncertainties regarding its silver leaching properties, and strategies for the prevention of silver leaching have remained elusive. This study focused on the evaluation of one type of commercially available SIAC for its ability to remove bromide while minimising silver leaching from the material. Both synthetic and real water matrices were tested. Depending on solution pH, it was found that changing the surface charge properties of SIAC, as measured by the point of zero charge pH, can result in additional bromide removal while minimising the extent of silver leaching. To better understand the mechanism of silver leaching from the SIAC, eight preconditioning environments, i.e. variable pH and ionic strength were tested for a fixed amount of SIAC and two preconditioning environments were selected for a more detailed investigation. Experiments carried out in synthetic water showed that preconditioning at pH 10.4 did not deteriorate the capacity of SIAC to remove bromide, but significantly decreased the release of silver in the form of ionic silver (Ag+), silver bromide (AgBr) and silver chloride (AgCl) from 40% for the pristine to 3% for the treated SIAC. This was confirmed using a groundwater sample. These results suggest that preconditioned SIAC has the potential to be an effective method for bromide removal with minimised silver leaching in a long-term field application for drinking water production.

AB Membrane photobioreactor (MPBR) technology is an emerging algae-based wastewater treatment system. Given the limitations due to the general use of conventional analytical approaches in previous research, this study aims to provide a more comprehensive assessment of MPBR performance through advanced characterisation techniques. New performance parameters are also proposed, encompassing five important aspects of MPBR system efficiency (i.e. biomass concentration, composition, production, nutrient uptake and harvesting potential). Under initial standard operating conditions, performance parameters, such as cell count/MLSS ratio, cell viability, proportion of bacteria and biomass yield coefficient, were found to offer new insights into the operation of MPBR. These parameters were then used, for the first time, to systematically investigate MPBRs operated under different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) and solids retention times (SRTs). Applying shorter HRT and SRT was observed to increase cell viability and productivity (up to 0.25 x 10(7) cells/mL center dot d), as anticipated due to the higher nutrient loading. It was noted that the faster growing algal cells featured lower requirement for nutrients. On the other hand, extending HRT and SRT resulted in a more heterogeneous culture (lower cell count/MLSS ratio and higher proportion of bacteria), achieving a higher degree of autoflocculation and greater NO3-N and PO4- P removals of up to 79% and 78% respectively. The results demonstrate the trade-off between applying different HRTs and SRTs and the importance of fully characterising system performance to critically assess the advantages and limitations of chosen operating conditions.

AB 1- A major challenge when assessing the impacts of human activities on the globe's natural resources is to account for the impacts of land use versus natural spatiotemporal variation in system dynamics. Current freshwater assessments are unable to resolve spatiotemporal confounding through study designs or statistical analyses. Observational studies typically fail to consider the period-by-location interaction in the absence of an impact.
   2- Here, I address the problem of spatiotemporal confounding using causal modelling based on spatiotemporal data to infer causal effects of wastewater on biotic ecosystems. A combination of statistical analysis and causation theory was used to address confounding bias. Benthic macroinvertebrate and environmental variable data were collected from locations upstream and downstream of a wastewater treatment plant discharge point in south-eastern Australia over 1.5 years. The composite hypotheses based on the theoretical relationships among these variables were summarised in a causal diagram. Model building and testing was conducted using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) was used for model building and hypothesis testing.
   3- The results indicated that the causal effects of effluent on macroinvertebrate communities could be inferred using causal modelling. The macroinvertebrate communities responded to water quality degradation with a clear shift in community composition after the discharge point and this change varied seasonally. Chlorophyll a, total organic carbon, zinc, conductivity, temperature, and its interaction with conductivity, were important determinants of the macroinvertebrate community composition. Causal models also explained the spatiotemporal variations in environmental variables. The consistency of data with the structure of the causal diagram was confirmed with global Fisher's C-test.
   4- Causal modelling has been shown to be a useful tool in environmental impact studies. In this study, the usefulness of causal modelling was attributed to its proficiency in combining all of the elements necessary for an efficient risk assessment through dealing with spatial and temporal confounding, facilitating communication between scientists and resource managers, and supporting management decision making.

AB We combined profiling of the bloom-forming and potentially toxigenic cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens using a multiparameter probe equipped with a phycoerythrin sensor (in vivo fluorometry, IVL) in Lake Mondsee, Austria, with flow cytometric live analyses of discrete samples taken from several depths in the upper 20 m of the water column. Results obtained by IVL and acoustic flow cytometry (AFC) were compared to microscopic analyses of integrated (0-21 m) water samples using fixed material. This comparison was made because the integrated samples are used for the Austrian monitoring programme according to the EU Water Framework Directive. We demonstrate that AFC provides quantitative analyses of the filaments of P. rubescens that are significantly correlated to IVF and microscopic analyses, allowing rapid (within hours) and more precise calculation of P. rubescens biomass than estimates derived from IVL. Our analysis shows that vertically integrated water samples provide unreliable information on the concentration of P. rubescens in the upper surface waters and on the peak concentration of P. rubescens within the water column. We conclude that the protocol that we developed is superior to the current monitoring practice. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Treating drinking water appropriately depends, in part, on the robustness of source water quality risk assessments, however quantifying the proportion of infectious, human pathogenic Cryptosporidium oocysts remains a significant challenge. We analysed 962 source water samples across nine locations to profile the occurrence, rate and timing of infectious, human pathogenic Cryptosporidium in surface waters entering drinking water reservoirs during rainfall-runoff conditions. At the catchment level, average infectivity over the four-year study period reached 18%; however, most locations averaged <5%. The maximum recorded infectivity fraction within a single rainfall runoff event was 65.4%, and was dominated by C. parvum. Twenty-two Cryptosporidium species and genotypes were identified using PCR-based molecular techniques; the most common being C. parvum, detected in 23% of water samples. Associations between landuse and livestock stocking characteristics with Cryptosporidium were determined using a linear mixed-effects model. The concentration of pathogens in water were significantly influenced by flow and dominance of land-use by commercial grazing properties (as opposed to lifestyle properties) in the catchment (p < 0.01). Inclusion of measured infectivity and human pathogenicity data into a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) could reduce the source water treatment requirements by up to 2.67 log removal values, depending on the catchment, and demonstrated the potential benefit of collating such data for QMRAs.

AB The highly volatile methanethiol (MT) with an extremely low odor threshold and distinctive putrid smell is often identified as a major odorous compound generated under anaerobic conditions. As an intermediate compound in the course of anaerobic digestion, the extent of MT emission is closely related to the time of anaerobic reaction. In this study, lab-scale anaerobic digesters were operated at solids retention time (SRTs) of 15, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50 days to investigate the effect of SRT on MT emission. The experimental results demonstrated a bell-shaped curve of MT emission versus SRT with a peak around 20 days SRT. In order to understand this SRT effect, a kinetic model was developed to describe MT production and utilization dynamics in the course of anaerobic digestion and calibrated with the experimental results collected from this study. The model outcome revealed that the high protein content in the feed sludge together with the large maintenance coefficient of MT fermenters are responsible for the peak MT emission emergence in the range of typical SRT used for anaerobic digestion. A further analysis of the kinetic model shows that it can be extensively simplified with reasonable approximation to a form that anaerobic digestion practitioners could easily use to predict the MT and SRT relationship.

AB A new La2O3-Lu2O3-TiO2 glass with high refractive index was successfully prepared by containerless processing method. Although this glass without network formers performs low glass forming ability, aerodynamic levitation has been introduced to obtain the bulk glass spheres with a diameter of similar to 3.5 mm. The glass shows good mechanical properties with the Vickers hardness of 8.26 GPa and fracture toughness of 1.09 MPa.m(1/2). The density is up to 5.51 g/cm(3), which is favorable to obtain high refractive index. The glass performs good thermal stability with the glass transition temperature as high as 812 degrees C. nd value of refractive index is as high as 2.1202. And Abbe number is 28.2. This indicates that the glass shows excellent optical properties, which can satisfy commercial requirements. Moreover, new glass also overcomes the shortage of deep color of conventional high refractive heavy metal oxide glasses. The transmittance of the glass is near to 75% in the visible and near infrared range. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A double-layer broadband antireflective coating (ARC) with graded-index was prepared on ZnSe substrate by using ZnSe hollow nanoparticles (HNPs). The bottom high-refractive-index layer (HIL) was made by closed-packed ZnSe HNPs array, and the top low-refractive-index layer (LIL) was gained by a sacrificial template method. The refractive indices of both layers are close to the theoretical model. A high transmittance, up to 91.5%, is achieved in the near-infrared spectral range with incident angles ranging from 0 degrees to 30 degrees. It also exhibits excellent mechanical stability, and sustains high transmittance over a much wider optical band, compared to the single-index ARC, making it promising for further applications.

AB The present work reports the synthesis of Titania/Zinc Oxide (TiO2/ZnO) nanocomposite and improvisation of its optical properties through Aluminium (Al) plasmon impregnation into ZnO using sol-gel technique. The X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) analysis showed that Al impregnation has not altered the crystallographic and morphological features of TiO2/ZnO. UV-Vis Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (UV-DRS) revealed the enhanced light harvesting capabilities of Titania/Al impregnated Zinc Oxide (TiO2/Al-ZnO) as a result of about 95% of diffused reflectance, the highest reported to-date. Field dependent dark and photocurrent measurements showed that impacted by the plasmonic-effect, the photo and dark current values of TiO2/Al-ZnO are higher than those of TiO2/ZnO by similar to 2 and similar to 1.5 folds respectively. Owing to the improved photo and electrical conductive properties of the nanocomposite due to Al impregnation, the as-prepared TiO2/Al-ZnO nanocomposite qualifies as a novel and suitable candidate for application as a proficient photoanode in Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs).

AB Molybdenum substitution in the La2MgNi8-xCoMox alloys can improve the hydrogen desorption properties and affect the electrochemical reaction process for the alloy electrode. The optimum composition of the alloys is La2MgNi7.7CoMo0.3. The discharge capacity (C-max) and cycle stability (S-100) can reach about 380 mAh/g and 80%, which already exceed the most typical AB(3)-type and commercial AB(5) Co-containing hydrogen storage alloys. The decrease of anti-corrosion ability and the oxidation current density are the main reasons for the performances degradation when the x value is above 0.3 in the La2MgNi8-xCoMox alloys.
