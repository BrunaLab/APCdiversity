TI Investigating the effects of amphipathic gastrointestinal compounds on

AB Interactions between hydrophobic drugs and endogenous gastrointestinal substances have the potential to manipulate drug concentration in the human gastrointestinal system, and thus likely play an important role in determining the rate of absorption for hydrophobic drugs. The effects of phospholipids, bile salts and digestive proteins on the solution behaviour of clofazimine in biorelevant media was demonstrated here using dissolution experiments and solid state analytical techniques. Clofazimine is a hydrophobic, anti-mycobacterial agent with virtually no detectable water solubility in its free base form. Salt forms of the drug offer improved aqueous solubility but are unstable in solutions at low pH (pH 1.6) or high pH (pH 6.5). At low pH and high chloride ion concentrations, CFZ in solution experiences a high driving force to crystallize from solution as a hydrochloride salt, which is insoluble, while at high pH CFZ does not dissolve to any extent. In this study, it is demonstrated that amphipathic compounds present in the gastric and intestinal systems can overcome the instability experienced by CFZ at these pH values. This is done by encapsulation of the hydrophobic drug in mixed bile salt phospholipid micelles in both the gastric and intestinal fluid, and by the drug actively binding with the digestive enzyme pepsin in the gastric system. Pepsin binds and solubilises the drug at even relatively low concentration (0.1 mg/mL). When pepsin concentration is increased in the gastric media, a corresponding increase in the solution stability of CFZ is observed.

AB Spironolactone form I melts at about 70 degrees lower than form II, which is very unusual for two co-existing polymorphs. The phase relationships involving this unprecedented case of dimorphism have been investigated by constructing a topological pressure-temperature phase diagram. The transition from polymorph I to polymorph II is unambiguously exothermic while it is accompanied with an increase in the specific volume. This indicates that the dP/dT slope of the I-II equilibrium curve is negative. The convergence of the melting equilibrium lines at high pressure leads to a topological P-T diagram in which polymorph I possesses a stable phase region at high pressure. Thus, forms I and II are monotropically related at ordinary pressure and turn to an enantiotropic relationship at high pressure. Given that polymorph I is the densest form, it negates the rule of thumb that the densest form is also the most stable form at room temperature, similar to the case of paracetamol.

AB Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a polyphenolic catechin from green tea, well known for being bioactive in age-associated pathologies where oxidative stress plays a preeminent role. The activity of this molecule is however contrasted by its high chemical and metabolic instability that determines a poor concentration of the antioxidant within the biological system after administration. In order to protect the molecule and increase its delivery efficiency, we have encapsulated EGCG inside anionic liposomes made of 1-palmitoy1-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine and cholesteryl hemisuccinate. To maximize EGCG internalization, magnesium salt was added in the preparation. However stable nanodispersions suitable for drug delivery were obtained only after treatment with Poloxamer-407, a polyethylene-propylene glycol copolymer. The structural and morphological properties of the produced dispersion were studied by X-ray diffraction, which showed a multilamellar structure even after EGCG addition and an ordering effect of Poloxamer-407; Dynamic Light Scattering demonstrated serum stability of the liposomes. The characterization was completed by evaluating both encapsulation efficiency (100%, in the final formulation) and in vitro EGCG release. Since oxidative stress is involved in numerous retinal degenerative diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration, the ability of these liposomes to contrast H2O2-induced cell death was assessed in human retinal cells. Morphological changes at the subcellular level were analyzed by Transmission Electron Microscopy, which showed that mitochondria were better preserved in cells treated with liposomes then those treated with free EGCG. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that the produced formulation enhances the efficacy of EGCG under stress conditions, thus representing a potential formulation for the intracellular delivery of EGCG in diseases caused by oxidative damage.

AB It is of great importance to get a deeper understanding of the binding behaviour and functionality of different types of dry binders, since dry binders are crucial to ensure appropriate properties of dry granules and tablets. Based on previous studies, the most effective dry binders of chemically different types have been chosen to apply a new approach analysing the compressibility of tablets made from pure dry binders. Therefore, tablets were compressed at different tableting speeds to reveal binding behaviour of dry binders. Viscoelasticity, plasticity or abrasiveness were derived from force-displacement curves of tablets, which were manufactured at varying tableting pressure. In addition, elastic recovery, tabletability, fracture energy and out-of-die Heckel analysis were performed in order to get a comprehensive understanding on mechanical properties of dry binder for tableting. The new approach indicated explanations for results of previous studies in terms of tablet tensile strength, friability and dry granule properties. It enables a rational selection of dry binders for certain processes.

AB We investigated if the self-assembled micelles of rebaudioside A (RA) could potentially be utilized as an ocular drug-delivery system in this investigation. RA self-assembled into micelles with ultra-small particle sizes ( < 4 nm) in a homogeneous distribution state (polydispersity index < 0.3). RA had good cellular tolerance and no cytotoxicity was observed at concentrations <= 18.5 mg/ml at 72 h of incubation. RA also did not cause cell apoptosis at concentration <= 12 mg/ml. Coumarin-6 (Cou6)-loaded RA micelles had good cellular tolerance and in vivo non-irritants to the rabbit eyes. RA micelles dramatically improved the cellular uptake of Cou6 (compared to free-Cou6 P < 0.05); an energy-independent, active, intracellular endocytosis pathway was apparently involved, and cellular organelles such as lysosomes, endoplasmic reticuli, and mitochondria were observed with a high distribution of Cou6, while a much more sophisticated endocytosis pathway was apparently involved in the ex vivo corneal endocytosis mechanism tests. The use of RA micelles significantly improved in vivo corneal permeation of the encapsulated Cou6 when compared to free-Cou6 eye drops (P < 0.05). These findings indicate that RA micelle formulations have great potential as a novel ocular drug-delivery system to improve the bioavailability of hydrophobic drugs.

AB In the field of dermal drug delivery, determining the penetration depth of actives is a standard procedure for the development of novel formulations. Regarding the vehicle components, respective penetration studies are rather scarce due to their often challenging analytics. However, an understanding of the interactions between drugs and additives during skin penetrating could help to develop promising drug delivery systems. Thus, the objective of the present study was to simultaneously monitor the skin penetration of the incorporated model drug diclofenac sodium and the semifluorinated oil perfluorohexyloctane (F6H8) from newly developed nanoemulsions. In vitro tape stripping studies were conducted and the tapes were analysed for their content of drug and additive in parallel by HPLC and F-19 NMR. The penetration depth and total recovered amount of both substances of interest were successfully determined on each tape strip. The vehicle oil compound F6H8 itself showed a very small skin penetration, while the penetration of diclofenac sodium was consistently about 9- to 10-fold higher. Higher amounts of the oil content led to higher skin penetration of diclofenac sodium and slightly increased oil penetration; this effect might be explained by the increasing occlusion effect caused by increasing amounts of fluorinated oil.

AB Oral delivery of proteins and peptides is a challenge due to their degradation in the stomach. To overcome this challenge, ragweed (Ambrosia elatior) pollen grains were engineered to serve as protective microcapsules. A matrix comprising of Eudragit L100-55, an enteric polymer was deposited on the inner surfaces of ragweed pollens to protect the encapsulated protein from gastric degradation and to achieve pH-dependent release in the intestine. The Eudragit L100-55 matrix was formed without use of organic solvents so that solvent-induced damage to protein molecules could be prevented. To demonstrate the concept, bovine serum albumin (BSA) a model protein was used. A matrix of Eudragit L100-55 embedded with BSA was prepared in ragweed pollens by optimizing their respective concentrations for maximizing BSA loading in the matrix. The ability of this optimized formulation to protect BSA in simulated gastric acid fluid was evaluated. Release studies in simulated gastric fluid (pH 1.2) showed minimal BSA release from the ragweed-Eudragit L100-55 formulation. Analysis of BSA retained in the formulation after its exposure to gastric fluid confirmed that the residual BSA had not denatured. Release studies in the simulated intestinal fluid (pH 6.8) showed that ragweed pollen offered additional controlled release mechanism within the first few hours of release by virtue of their solid wall. In conclusion, upon use of a protein-friendly solvent for Eudragit L100-55, proteins could be encapsulated in ragweed pollen without denaturing them, and the resulting formulation exhibited selective release of the proteins at intestinal pH suggesting that the ragweed pollen grain-based formulation could be promising for oral delivery of proteins.

AB While highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has significantly reduced mortality rates in patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), its efficacy may be impeded by emergence of drug resistance caused by lack of patient adherence. A therapeutic strategy that requires infrequent drug administration as a result of sustained release of antiretroviral drugs would put less burden on the patient. Long-acing antiretroviral prodrugs for HIV therapy were synthesized through modification of the active drugs, emtricitabine (FTC) and elvitegravir (EVG), with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in one-step, one-pot, high-yielding reactions. The in vitro drug release profiles of these synthetic conjugates demonstrated sustained and controlled release of the active drug over a period of 3-4 weeks attributable to the hydrolysis of the chemical linker in conjunction with the hydrophilicity of the parent drug. Both conjugates exhibited superior antiviral activities in tissue culture models of HIV replication as compared to those of the free drugs, strengthening their role as potent prodrugs for HIV therapy. Pharmacokinetic analysis in CD1 mice further confirmed the long-acing aspect of these conjugates with released drug concentrations in plasma detected at their respective IC90/IC95 values over a period of 2 weeks and discernable amounts of active drug even at 6 weeks. Our findings suggest that the injectable small molecule conjugates could be used as long-acing controlled release of FTC and EVG in attempts to mitigate adherence-related HIV resistance.

AB Soluplus (R) is an amphiphilic graft copolymer used in hot melt extrusion applications and electrospinning. Very little information is available on the use of Soluplus (R) as a film former and in the development of film-based formulations. The overall aim of this work was to study the mechanical and adhesive properties of Soluplus (R) films prepared by the solvent casting technique. More specifically, we discovered that vitamin E can serve as a plasticizer for the Soluplus (R) polymer and to significantly modulate its mechanical and adhesive properties. Vitamin E (0-75% w/w) and Soluplus (R) were dissolved in ethanol and cast on liners to produce transparent films. Cast films were tested for their physiochemical properties by IR, XRD, and MDSC, and for their adhesive and mechanical properties by texture analysis. Vitamin E was found to be miscible with Soluplus (R) and to reduce the crystallinity of the films. Vitamin E also decreased the films' tensile strength and Young's modulus while significantly increasing their percent elongation. The most notable effect was the observed increase in the adhesiveness (tackiness) and hydrophobicity of the films, which was evidenced by a significant increase in their water contact angle and a decrease in their swelling capacity and disintegration. These observations indicated that vitamin E/Soluplus (R) blends might be used for the preparation of highly pliable films, especially when made with 30-50% vitamin E, and in the development of a new type of pressure sensitive adhesive films when prepared with >= 65% vitamin E load.

AB Unprotected chronic exposure to solar radiation can contribute to premature skin cancer and sunscreens are a key factor to avoid those detrimental effects. Currently, there is a growing interest in the photoprotector and antioxidant potential of bioactive substances, such as rutin, that could increase the sun protection factor (SPF) value and, also, donate multifunctional characteristics to sunscreens. Recent in vitro findings indicated that rutin, when incorporated into sunscreens, can provide antioxidant activity and SPF improvement. However, clinical studies are fundamental to determine this activity, due to the lack of repeatability of in vitro methodology and low correlation with the in vivo data. We aimed at evaluating the clinical safety and in vivo SPF of rutin by comparing sunscreen formulations containing 0.1% (w/w) rutin, 3.0% (w/w) butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane and 8.0% (w/w) octyl dimethyl PABA (2-ethylhexyl 4-(dimethylamino)benzoato) with a similar bioactive-free preparation. Additionally, skin hydration, in vitro SPF and in vitro antioxidant activity of rutin, in association with the ultraviolet (UV) fillers, were investigated. The safety profile of the formulations under sun-exposed skin conditions qualified the formulas for clinical efficacy assays. 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) test confirmed the antioxidant properties of rutin, revealing around 40% increase in radical scavenging potential when the bioactive compound was present. Rutin in combination with the UV filters robustly elevated the clinical SPF around 70%, when compared with the bioactive-free formulation. To date, this is the first report in the specialized literature of an in vivo SPF measurement of a rutin-containing photoprotective preparation, supporting the claim that rutin is an effective and safe bioactive compound to be used in multifunctional sunscreens.

AB The insertion of specific derivatives into pre-formed colloidal systems has been shown to be a useful method for modifying their pharmacokinetic characteristics and biodistribution profiles.
   In this experimental work the effect of the post-insertion of different PEG-derivatives into pre-formed 100-nm liposomes made up of various lipid mixtures (DMPC, DPPC, DOPC, DSPC and cholesterol at different molar ratios) was investigated. The vesicles were incubated with increasing amounts of DSPE-mPEG(2000) as sterically stabilized micelles (5, 10 and 15% w/w with respect to the liposomal lipid mixture) in order to favour the insertion of the PEG-lipid into the liposomal bilayer. The colloidal formulations were characterized by photo-correlation spectroscopy; the DSPE-mPEG(2000) integrated into the pre-formed liposomes was demonstrated by means of field flow fractionation while the amount of post-inserted compound was quantified using a suitable spectrophotometric assay (I-2 assay). Similar investigations have been performed using PEG-derivatives characterized by a different molecular weight.
   The physico-chemical properties of the various liposomal formulations were influenced by the post-insertion of PEG-derivatives. The lipid mixture made up of saturated phospholipids and cholesterol proved to be the best, post-insertion (P.I.E.).
   The post-insertion technique may be a suitable approach to be used in personalized (nano)medicine.

AB Biotherapeutic protein formulations are often high concentration liquid protein solutions, which are required to be stable under pharmaceutically relevant storage conditions and presence of external stress. Non-ionic detergents like polysorbate have been the most commonly used detergent to maintain formulation stability. Recently, particle formation in polysorbate containing biotherapeutic formulations has arisen as a major quality concern and potential patient risk factor. In this review, we provide a general overview into (i) degradation of polysorbates, (ii) polysorbate analytics, (iii) particle formation induced by polysorbate degradation and root causes thereof, (iv) particle composition and (v) various influencing factors that might lead to particle formation. Consequently, we explore the role of polysorbate degradation in particle formation. Additionally, various degradation pathways and the current discussed root causes are reviewed.

AB Recent advances in nanomaterials have made iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) as an innovative approach for the delivery of genes. However, the effectiveness of IONPs-assisted gene delivery is currently suffering from their poor uniformity, which not only exhibits detrimental effect on the magnetic property, but also leads to the poor reproducibility to maintain the optimal gene delivery. To this end, the present study developed extremely uniform 15 nm-sized IONPs with a good monodispersity in water phase. These ultra-uniform IONPs exhibit notable potentials for an efficient gene delivery to human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) with the assistance of magnetic force, which partly owes to their abilities to facilitate the cellular uptake, as well as to induce the rapid DNA release and the following nuclear transport. Besides, no significant detrimental effects of these IONPs are observed either on the proliferation or the multi-lineage differentiation potential of hMSCs. The current study highlights the potential advantages of designing extremely uniform magnetic nanomaterials for an efficient and safe delivery of genes to stem cells.

AB We analyze the stability and accuracy of second order limiters for the discontinuous Galerkin method on unstructured triangular meshes. We derive conditions for a limiter such that the numerical solution preserves second order accuracy and satisfies the local maximum principle. This leads to a new measure of cell size that is approximately twice as large as the radius of the inscribed circle. It is shown with numerical experiments that the resulting bound on the time step is tight. Finally, we consider various combinations of limiting points and limiting neighborhoods and present numerical experiments comparing the accuracy, stability, and efficiency of the corresponding limiters.

AB Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration (CheFSI) is a popular and powerful solver for the eigenvalue problems embedded in electronic structure calculations. Effective use of ChFSI requires that the user choose good values for several parameters, notably the filter degree d. Finding a good value for d is typically done with user experience and some trial and error. If the user chooses a bad value for d, then convergence can be slow. For real-space computation using high-accuracy discretizations, the degree search space may be exceptionally large, making the search for a good degree difficult. We develop a method that is more robust to the consequences of bad choices of d; we also provide a heuristic-based method for choosing d automatically if the user is not able to venture a good guess. We note that only by-products of CheFSI are needed to track filter performance. We provide examples that demonstrate near-equivalence to CheFSI when d is near-optimal, and a reduction in computational resource requirements in other cases. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Next generation, conservative finite element hydrodynamic and transport models are vital for accurate and efficient ocean, estuary and river simulation. Numerical models such as these have been developed for decades by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the Engineering Research and Development Center (ERDC). This paper focuses on recently developed implicit, multi-dimensional finite element 3D shallow water and transport models included in the Adaptive Hydraulics (AdH) numerical suite. These AdH 3D models benefit from their adaptive meshing capabilities to resolve sharp solution gradients, such as those often encountered with baroclinic wedges traveling up an estuary channel. This paper presents the AdH 3D mathematical formulation and solution procedure used to solve the weak finite element equations for these models, along with results for several common verification cases and an AdH Galveston Bay validation study. A novel Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method for 3D shallow water models is described which reduces to the AdH 2D shallow water SUPG formulation under certain conditions. Careful attention is placed on ensuring discrete consistency in the equation set. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The algorithms are utilizing Octree Cartesian grids in the paradigm of distributed computing, and are designed to balance the computational load. The method is shown to be fast, scalable and first-order accurate. The procedure is robust, creates a feature-preserving surface and naturally handles any topological difficulty within its mathematical formulation. Several two- and three-dimensional illustrations are provided as well as accuracy and scaling analyses. We show the ability to construct computational grids for moderately large molecules in less than a few seconds when an optimal number of processors is used. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Quadrature by Expansion (QBX) is a quadrature method for approximating the value of the singular integrals encountered in the evaluation of layer potentials. It exploits the smoothness of the layer potential by forming locally-valid expansions which are then evaluated to compute the near or on-surface value of the potential. Recent work towards coupling of a Fast Multipole Method (FMM) to QBX yielded a first step towards the rapid evaluation of such integrals (and the solution of related integral equations), albeit with only empirically understood error behavior. In this paper, we improve upon this approach with a modified algorithm for which we give a comprehensive analysis of error and cost in the case of the Laplace equation in two dimensions. For the same levels of (user-specified) accuracy, the new algorithm empirically has cost-per-accuracy comparable to prior approaches. We provide experimental results to demonstrate scalability and numerical accuracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a three-dimensional (3D) common-refinement method for non-matching unstructured meshes between non-overlapping subdomains of incompressible turbulent fluid flow and nonlinear hyperelastic structure. The fluid flow is discretized using a stabilized Petrov-Galerkin method, and the large deformation structural formulation relies on a continuous Galerkin finite element method. An arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation with a nonlinear iterative force correction (NIFC) coupling is achieved in a staggered partitioned manner by means of fully decoupled implicit procedures for the fluid and solid discretizations. To begin, we first investigate the accuracy of common-refinement method (CRM) to satisfy the traction equilibrium condition along the fluid-elastic interface with non-matching meshes. We systematically assess the accuracy of CRM against the matching grid solution by varying grid mismatch between the fluid and solid meshes over a tubular elastic body. We demonstrate the second-order accuracy of CRM through uniform refinements of fluid and solid meshes along the interface. We then extend the error analysis to transient data transfer across non-matching meshes between the fluid and solid solvers. We show that the common-refinement discretization across non-matching fluid-structure grids yields accurate transfer of the physical quantities across the fluid-solid interface. We next solve a 3D fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem of a cantilevered hyperelastic plate behind a circular bluff body and verify the accuracy of coupled solutions with respect to the available solution in the literature. By varying the solid interface resolution, we generate various non-matching grid ratios and quantify the accuracy of CRM for the nonlinear structure interacting with a laminar flow. We illustrate that the CRM with the partitioned NIFC treatment is stable for low solid-to-fluid density ratio and non-matching meshes for the 3D FSI problem. Finally, we demonstrate the 3D parallel implementation of the common-refinement with the NIFC method for a realistic engineering problem of drilling riser undergoing complex vortex-induced vibration with strong added mass effects and turbulent wake flow.

AB In this paper, we present a quadratic serendipity discontinuous Galerkin finite element (DGFEM) discretization of the S-N transport equation for arbitrary polygonal grids. The quadratic serendipity functions are constructed from products of linear Generalized Barycentric Coordinates (GBC) and are fully compatible with arbitrary polygonal grids. The piecewise linear (PWL) functions are a GBC that have been previously utilized for DGFEM transport. We employ these PWL functions, and others for comparison, as the underlying linear functions in this work. Once constructed, the quadratic serendipity functions span the {1, x, y, x(2), xy, y(2)} space of functions and grow by 2n on a mesh element where n is the number of the polygon's vertices. Numerical tests confirm that the functions capture exactly quadratic solutions and appropriate convergence rates are observed, including a test case involving spatial adaptive mesh refinement. Finally, the functions are analyzed for diffusive problems and retain full resolution in the thick diffusion limit. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We develop two local energy-preserving integrators and a global energy-preserving integrator for the general multisymplectic Hamiltonian system. When applied to the 1D and multi-dimensional N-coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations, the given schemes have the exact preservation of the local/global conservation law and are decoupled in the components psi(n,) n = 1, 2, ... , N, i.e., each of the components can be solved independently. The decoupled feature is significant and helpful for overcoming the computational difficulty of the N-coupled (N >= 3) nonlinear Schrodinger equations, especially of the multi-dimensional case. The composition method is employed to improve the accuracy of the schemes in time and the discrete fast Fourier transform is used to reduce the computational complexity. Several numerical experiments are carried out to exhibit the behaviors of the wave solutions. Numerical results confirm the theoretical results. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been widely used in state estimation and parameter estimation for the dynamic system where observational data is obtained sequentially in time. Very burdened simulations for the forward problem are needed to update a large number of EnKF ensemble samples. This will slow down the analysis efficiency of the EnKF for large-scale and high dimensional models. To reduce uncertainty and accelerate posterior inference, a two-stage ensemble Kalman filter is presented to improve the sequential analysis of EnKF. It is known that the final posterior ensemble may be concentrated in a small portion of the entire support of the initial prior ensemble. It will be much more efficient if we first build a new prior by some partial observations, and construct a surrogate only over the significant region of the new prior. To this end, we construct a very coarse model using generalized multiscale finite element method (GMsFEM) and generate a new prior ensemble in the first stage. GMsFEM provides a set of hierarchical multiscale basis functions supported in coarse blocks. This gives flexibility and adaptivity to choosing degree of freedoms to construct a reduce model. In the second stage, we build an initial surrogate model based on the new prior by using GMsFEM and sparse generalized polynomial chaos (gPC)-based stochastic collocation methods. To improve the initial surrogate model, we dynamically update the surrogate model, which is adapted to the sequential availability of data and the updated analysis. The two-stage EnKF can achieve a better estimation than standard EnKF, and significantly improve the efficiency to update the ensemble analysis (posterior exploration). To enhance the applicability and flexibility in Bayesian inverse problems, we extend the two-stage EnKF to non-Gaussian models and hierarchical models. In the paper, we focus on the time fractional diffusion-wave models in porous media and investigate their Bayesian inverse problems using the proposed two-stage EnKF. A few numerical examples are carried out to demonstrate the performance of the two-stage EnKF method by taking account of parameter and structure inversion in permeability fields and source functions.

AB The current paper presents a large time step wave adding scheme (hereafter LTS-WA) originated in LeVeque's large time Godunov scheme, i.e. constructing numerical schemes via adding strong waves of discontinuity decomposition. Compared with the original scheme, we use a different strategy for wave adding and extend it to multidimensional cases. For rarefaction waves, we propose a grid cell decomposition method which can automatically satisfy the entropy condition and avoid nonphysical solutions. We give detailed formulae of the scheme, and make numerical experiments using scalar equations and Euler equations in one and multi-dimensional cases. Numerical results show that, besides the advantage of large time step, the new scheme has a lower numerical dissipation and a higher resolution of shocks and contact discontinuities with the increase of CFL number in certain range.

   PROBLEM; FRAMEWORK
AB The simulation of complex nonlinear engineering systems such as compressible fluid flows may be targeted to make more efficient and accurate the approximation of a specific (scalar) quantity of interest of the system. Putting aside modeling error and parametric uncertainty, this may be achieved by combining goal-oriented error estimates and adaptive anisotropic spatial mesh refinements. To this end, an elegant and efficient framework is the one of (Riemannian) metric-based adaptation where a goal-based a priori error estimation is used as indicator for adaptivity.
   This work proposes a novel extension of this approach to the case of aforementioned system approximations bearing a stochastic component. In this case, an optimization problem leading to the best control of the distinct sources of errors is formulated in the continuous framework of the Riemannian metric space. Algorithmic developments are also presented in order to quantify and adaptively adjust the error components in the deterministic and stochastic approximation spaces.
   The capability of the proposed method is tested on various problems including a supersonic scramjet inlet subject to geometrical and operational parametric uncertainties. It is demonstrated to accurately capture discontinuous features of stochastic compressible flows impacting pressure-related quantities of interest, while balancing computational budget and refinements in both spaces.

AB We analyze the properties of a number of forms of artificial viscosity, when applied to the Lagrangian phase of a staggered grid Lagrange-remap hydrodynamics code, using a full von Neumann stability analysis. This allows us to derive the numerical dispersion relation for a single step of the scheme.
   We study the development of shocks within a weakly nonlinear acoustic wave in detail. The second-order von Neumann-Richtmyer artificial viscosity leads to significant post-shock ringing, while adding linear artificial viscosity reduces the accuracy of the scheme to first order and introduces a dependence on flow Mach number. The form of the numerical dispersion relation suggests that to control the post-shock ringing without reducing the accuracy of the solution, a higher-order artificial viscosity is required which will preferentially damp modes close to the mesh scale which are subject to significant phase error.
   The application of ideas based on the Large Eddy Simulation technique for the modelling of turbulent flows leads to a form of artificial viscous stress similar to that described by Schulz (1964). This artificial stress has several features which are beneficial for accurate modelling of compressible turbulent mixing processes, as demonstrated by a range of other test problems.
   We show that, in the limit of smooth flows, Christensen's approach of applying limiters to the components of a low-order artificial viscosity is analytically equivalent to a high-order scheme. However, the directionally-split implementation suggested in the original publication leads to damping of low Mach number Kelvin-Helmholtz roll up problems similar to that previously observed for finite-volume Godunov schemes.

AB The present paper describes a numerical framework to simulate transcritical and supercritical flows utilising the compressible form of the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the Perturbed Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT) equation of state (EoS); both conservative and quasi-conservative formulations have been tested. This molecular model is an alternative to cubic EoS which show low accuracy computing the thermodynamic properties of hydrocarbons at temperatures typical for high pressure injection systems. Liquid density, compressibility, speed of sound, vapour pressures and density derivatives are calculated with more precision when compared to cubic EoS. Advection test cases and shock tube problems are included to show the overall performance of the developed framework employing both formulations. Additionally, two-dimensional simulations of nitrogen and dodecane jets are presented to demonstrate the multidimensional capability of the developed model. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB An alternative formulation of conservative weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) finite difference scheme with the classical WENO-JS weights (Jiang et al. (2013) [6]) has been successfully used for solving hyperbolic conservation laws. However, it fails to achieve the optimal order of accuracy at the critical points of a smooth function. Here, we demonstrate that the WENO-Z weights (Borges et al. (2008) [1]) should be employed to recover the optimal order of accuracy at the critical points. Several one- and two-dimensional benchmark problems show the improved performance in terms of accuracy, resolution and shock capturing. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The discretization by the method of moments (MoM) of integral equations in the electromagnetic scattering analysis most often relies on divergence-conforming basis functions, such as the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) set, which preserve the normal continuity of the expanded currents across the edges arising from the discretization of the target boundary. Although for such schemes the boundary integrals become free from hypersingular kernel-contributions, which is numerically advantageous, their practical implementation in real-life scenarios becomes particularly cumbersome. Indeed, the application of the normal continuity condition on composite objects becomes elaborate and convoluted at junction-edges, where several regions intersect. Also, such edge-based schemes cannot even be applied to nonconformal meshes, where adjacent facets may not share single matching edges. In this paper, we present nonconforming schemes of discretization for the scattering analysis of complex objects based on the expansion of the boundary unknowns, electric or magnetic currents, with the facet-based monopolar-RWG set. We show with examples how these schemes exhibit great flexibility when handling composite piecewise homogeneous objects with junctions or targets modeled with nonconformal meshes. Furthermore, these schemes offer improved near- and far-field accuracy in the scattering analysis of electrically small single sharp-edged dielectric targets with moderate or high dielectric contrasts.

AB High resolution simulation of viscous fingering can offer an accurate and detailed prediction for subsurface engineering processes involving fingering phenomena. The fully implicit discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method has been shown to be an accurate and stable method to model viscous fingering with high Peclet number and mobility ratio. In this paper, we present two techniques to speedup large scale simulations of this kind. The first technique relies on a simple p-adaptive scheme in which high order basis functions are employed only in elements near the finger fronts where the concentration has a sharp change. As a result, the number of degrees of freedom is significantly reduced and the simulation yields almost identical results to the more expensive simulation with uniform high order elements throughout the mesh. The second technique for speedup involves improving the solver efficiency. We present an algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioner which allows the DG matrix to leverage the robust AMG preconditioner designed for the continuous Galerkin (CG) finite element method. The resulting preconditioner works effectively for fixed order DG as well as p-adaptive DG problems. With the improvements provided by the p-adaptivity and AMG preconditioning, we can perform high resolution three-dimensional viscous fingering simulations required for miscible displacement with high Peclet number and mobility ratio in greater detail than before for well injection problems.

AB Progressing toward more accurate and more efficient numerical codes for the simulation of transport and turbulence in the edge plasma of tokamaks, we propose in this work a new hybrid discontinuous Galerkin solver. Based on 2D advection-diffusion conservation equations for the ion density and the particle flux in the direction parallel to the magnetic field, the code simulates plasma transport in the poloidal section of tokamaks, including the open field lines of the Scrape-off Layer (SOL) and the closed field lines of the core region. The spatial discretization is based on a high-order hybrid DG scheme on unstructured meshes, which provides an arbitrary high-order accuracy while reducing considerably the number of coupled degrees of freedom with a local condensation process. A discontinuity sensor is employed to identify critical elements and regularize the solution with the introduction of artificial diffusion. Based on a finite-element discretization, not constrained by a flux-aligned mesh, the code is able to describe plasma facing components of any complex shape using Bohm boundary conditions and to simulate the plasma in versatile magnetic equilibria, possibly extended up to the center. Numerical tests using a manufactured solution show appropriate convergence orders when varying independently the number of elements or the degree of interpolation. Validation is performed by benchmarking the code with the well-referenced edge transport code SOLEDGE2D (Bufferand et al., 2013, 2015 [1,2]) in the WEST geometry. Final numerical experiments show the capacity of the code to deal with low-diffusion solutions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We develop a computational model for the solvation of charged molecules in an aqueous solvent. Such solvent is modeled as an incompressible fluid, and its dynamics is described by the Stokes equations. All the surface tension force, van der Waals dispersive force, electrostatic force, hydrostatic pressure, and viscous force are balanced on the solutesolvent interface, giving rise to the traction boundary conditions on such an interface. We use the level-set method for the solute-solvent interface motion. To describe the hydrophobic interaction that is characterized by the volume change of the solute region, we design special numerical boundary conditions for the Stokes equations. We then reformulate and discretize the Stokes equations with a second-order finite difference scheme using a MAC grid. At virtual nodes near the solute-solvent interface, we use interpolation to discretize the boundary conditions and formulate the difference equations at such nodes. The resulting linear system is reduced by the Schur complement and then solved by the least-squares method with various techniques of acceleration. Numerical tests show that our method has a second-order convergence in the maximum norm for both the velocity and pressure up to the boundary. We apply our methods to some model molecular systems. With the comparison of our approach with a well established, static solvation theory and method, our dynamic model and numerical techniques accurately reproduce the solvation free energies, and capture the dry and wet molecular states. Our work provides a possibility of describing solvent fluctuations through the solvent fluid flow. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This work describes the development and optimization of an implementation of an isotropic elastodynamic finite integration technique (EFIT) code for parallelized computation on Intel Knights Landing (KNL) hardware. EFIT is a numerical approach resulting in standard staggered-grid finite difference equations for the elastodynamic equations of motion to simulate bulk waves in solids. The computationally efficient simulation of elastodynamic wave propagation and interactions in aerospace materials is of high-interest in the fields of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and structural health monitoring (SHM). Ultrasonic inspection uses an ultrasonic signal, generated at the surface of the material/structure via use of a piezoelectric transducer, to propagate sound waves into the material where it interacts with any existing defects, as well as with structural boundaries and any material inhomogeneity. Reflections from defects and boundaries are then measured by a transducer. Realistic ultrasound simulation tools can significantly aid the development and optimization of inspection techniques and can assist in the interpretation of experimental data.
   The optimization of an elastodynamics simulation code for the KNL Many Integrated Core processor was performed. The optimization focused on data locality and vectorization. Results show that tiling of the data to exploit the cache behavior and allow for significant utilization of the KNL hardware. The MPI implementation allows for a scalable implementation enabling large problems to be simulated. The model results were validated against theoretical dispersion curves to within 2% of the group velocity, and within 0.5% of the phase velocity of the AO mode. Aggressive use of tiling, threading, and vectorization techniques allowed for dramatically improved time to solution. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This work is devoted to the development of a penalization method for the simulation of bubbly flows. Spherical bubbles are considered as moving penalized obstacles interacting with the fluid and a numerical method for ensuring the shear free condition at the liquid-bubble interface is proposed. Three test-cases (curved channel, inclined channel and 3D translating bubble) are used to validate the accuracy of the discretization ensuring the slip condition at the interface. Numerical simulations of a rising bubble in a quiescent liquid are performed for moderate Reynolds numbers. Considering bubble terminal velocities, initial accelerations and wake decay, the effect of the penalization viscosity used to ensure a uniform velocity in the penalized object is discussed. Finally, simulations of bubble swarms have been carried out in a fully periodic box with a large range of void fractions from 1% to 15%. The statistics provided by the simulations characterizing the bubble-induced agitation are found in remarkable agreement with the experiments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper considers an accurate and efficient numerical scheme for solving the radiative transfer equation (RTE) based on the discrete ordinates method (DOM) in highly forward-peaked scattering media. The DOM approximates the scattering integral of the RTE including the phase function into a quadrature sum with the total number of discrete angular directions (TND) by a quadrature set. Due to large numerical errors of the scattering integral based on the DOM in highly forward-peaked scattering, the phase function is renormalized to satisfy its normalization conditions. Although the renormalization approaches of the phase function improve the accuracy of the numerical results of the RTE, the computational efficiency of the RTE is still required. This paper develops the first order renormalization approach using the double exponential formula for three quadrature sets: level symmetric even, even and odd, and Lebedev sets in a wide range of the TND from 48 to 1454. Numerical errors of the three-dimensional time-dependent RTE are investigated by the analytical solutions of the RTE. The investigation shows that the level symmetric even set with the TND of 48 using the developed approach provides the most accurate results of the RTE among the quadrature sets in the range of the TND, while to obtain the same accuracy by the conventional zeroth order renormalization approach, the TND needs to be larger than 360. The results suggest the large reduction of computational loads by the developed approach to less than 10 percent from those in the conventional approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a third-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme is developed for the hyperbolic conservation laws on unstructured quadrilateral and triangular meshes. As a starting point, a general stencil is selected for the cell with any local topology, and a unified linear scheme can be constructed. However, in the traditional WENO scheme on unstructured meshes, the very large and negative weights may appear for the mesh with lower local mesh quality, which make the WENO scheme unstable even for the smooth tests. In the current scheme, an optimization approach is given to deal with the very large linear weights, and the splitting technique is considered to deal with the negative weights obtained by the optimization approach. The non-linear weights with the new smooth indicator are proposed as well, in which the local mesh quality and discontinuities of solutions are taken into account simultaneously. Numerical tests are presented to validate the current scheme. The expected convergence rate of accuracy is obtained, and the absolute value of error is not affected by mesh quality. The numerical tests with strong discontinuities validate the robustness of current WENO scheme. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we show that the Cahn-Hilliard equation possesses a local energy dissipation law, which is independent of boundary conditions and produces much more information of the original problem. To inherit the intrinsic property, we derive three novel local structure-preserving algorithms for the 2D Cahn-Hilliard equation by the concatenating method. In particular, when the nonlinear bulk potential f (phi) in the equation is chosen as the Ginzburg-Landau double-well potential, the method discussed by Zhang and Qiao (2012) [50] is a special case of our scheme II. Thanks to the Leibnitz rules and properties of operators, the three schemes are rigorously proven to conserve the discrete local energy dissipation law in any local time-space region. Under periodic boundary conditions, the schemes are proven to possess the discrete mass conservation and total energy dissipation laws. Numerical experiments are conducted to show the performance of the proposed schemes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In Fu et al. [23], a family of high-order targeted ENO (TENO) schemes with a new nonlinear weighting strategy has been proposed. Building upon this strategy, in the current paper, a new class of adaptive TENO schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws is proposed based on three new concepts: (1) a hierarchical voting strategy is proposed to improve the ENO-like stencil selection; (2) the TENO weighting strategy is extended to function as a built-in discontinuity-location detector. Since the reconstruction scheme must not cross any discontinuity, corresponding target schemes are selected from a set of predefined linear schemes which are optimized towards maximum accuracy order or spectral resolution; (3) based on the observation that the cut-off parameter C-T in the TENO weighting strategy determines nonlinear dissipation, a C-T adaptation strategy is developed to minimize numerical dissipation for high-wavenumber fluctuations while maintaining robustness for shock-capturing. Six-point and eight-point TENO schemes are constructed, and their spectral properties are analyzed by the ADR analysis. A set of benchmark cases is considered to demonstrate the performance of proposed adaptive TENO schemes. Numerical results suggest that the proposed TENO schemes preserve the accuracy order at first and second order critical points and show less numerical dissipation compared with typical WENO schemes. Moreover, the TENO8-NA scheme exhibits good results for both highly compressible flows and nearly incompressible turbulence. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a generalization of an all-Mach formulation for multiphase flows accounting for surface tension and viscous forces. The proposed numerical method is based on the consistent advection of conservative quantities and the advection of the color function used in the Volume of Fluid method avoiding any numerical diffusion of mass, momentum and energy across the interface during the advection step. The influence of surface tension and liquid compressibility on the dynamic response of the bubbles is discussed by comparing the full 3D solution with the predictions provided by the Rayleigh-Plesset equation for two relevant problems related to the dynamic response of bubbles to pressure disturbances: The linear oscillation of a single bubble in an acoustic field and the Rayleigh collapse problem. Finally, the problem of the collapse of a bubble close to a wall is compared with experimental results showing the robustness of the method to simulate the collapse of air bubbles in liquids in problems where bubbles generate a high velocity liquid jet.

AB In this paper, we propose a data-driven compressive sensing method for the effective and sparse representation of solutions to a stochastic system, in which a problem-dependent basis is constructed and used to exploit the sparse patterns. Given what appears to be a highly incomplete set of sample observations, the essential ingredients of the proposed method involve (i) estimating the covariance function from low-fidelity simulations, (ii) extracting the most dominant energetic modes from the Karhunen-Loeve analysis, and (iii) solving the basis pursuit problem associated with data-driven functions for high-fidelity models. Compared with other conventional compressive sensing methods that use a problem-independent basis, our approach can significantly increase the sparsity of expansion coefficients in many situations. When applied to uncertainty quantification problems such as partial differential equations with random input data, numerical experiments are carried out to show the effectiveness of our data-driven method in recovering the sparse solution globally over the physical domain.

AB Imaging via synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a well-established technique for effective scene reconstruction, with resolution up to a few centimeters. The measurement process requires the round trip time for the electromagnetic waves to travel to the scene and return back to the sensing mechanism. While hypothetically the round trip time can be exactly determined, in practice this distance can only be approximated, leading to errors in the round trip time estimates. These errors manifest as phase errors on the data and produce defocused imagery, making information extraction difficult. This investigation develops an autofocusing technique that exploits the correlation of the phase error on both the azimuth angle and spatial (cycles/meter) frequencies while also enforcing the piecewise smooth nature of the image. Our method estimates the phase error correction and the image through a joint optimization procedure. Specifically, our method incorporates a phase synchronization technique to estimate the unknown two-dimensional phase error. High order regularization is used in the optimization procedure, which helps to reduce speckle in the SAR image. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS

DE Compressible flow; Exact solution; Code verification
ID SHOCK WAVES; DYNAMICS
AB A family of exact self-similar solutions of the compressible Euler equations developed for hydrocode verification is described. This family generalizes the classic Noh problem, which has served as a standard verification test of numerical methods for modeling inviscid compressible flows for three decades. This generalization allows finite pressure initial conditions, nearly arbitrary equations of state, and describes shocked compression as well as isentropic expansion and compression of the gas. In particular, the solutions describe a) the propagation of a finite-strength spherical isentropic expansion wave into a moving uniform gas, leaving behind either a core of uniform gas at rest or a vacuum/cavitation; b) the convergence of a finite-strength isentropic compression wave into a uniform gas or a collapse of a cavity in a finite-pressure gas (a compressible analog of the Rayleigh problem); and c) the expansion of a finite-strength accretion shock wave into a converging isentropic flow of stagnating gas. Our proposed verification test seeks to numerically reproduce all three of these stages of gas motion in a single simulation run. The successful verification of a high-order Godunov Eulerian hydrodynamics code is presented as an example of the expected use of this family of exact solutions. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB First-order staggered-grid finite-difference methods are widely used to synthesize seismograms theoretically. They are also the basis of least-squares reverse time migration and full waveform inversion. It is important to accelerate the wave-equation simulation while still preserving high accuracy. Usually the same staggered-grid finite difference operator is used for all of the first-order spatial derivatives in the first-order acoustic wave-equation. In this paper, we propose a simplified staggered-grid finite-difference scheme which uses different finite-difference operators for different first-order spatial derivatives in the first-order acoustic wave-equation. Because the new dispersion relation is linear, the staggered-grid finite-difference coefficients are determined in the time-space domain with the previously proposed linear method. We demonstrate by dispersion analysis and numerical simulation the efficiency of the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A time integration method based on dual time stepping coupled with a multigrid and implicit iterative solver is discussed for overcoming the temporal stiffness associated with modeling unsteady atmospheric flows. Adopting the dual time stepping allows solving an unsteady flow problem as a steady-state one by introducing a pseudo-time derivative into the governing equations. Consequently, the model uses a large time step and leads to a reduction in computational time. In the framework of the dual time stepping, a full approximation storage multigrid and lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel implicit solver are employed to accelerate convergence in a structured, quadrilateral grid. The discretization of a physical-time derivative is based on a second-order backward differentiation formula or a family of singly diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta methods. The spatial terms of nonhydrostatic equations are discretized with a second-order Roe scheme in the finite volume method. To assess the performance of the model in terms of accuracy and efficiency, which are indicated by the normalized error norms and wall-clock time, respectively, three idealized tests are performed with the unsteady flow problems of isentropic vortex, rising thermal bubble and inertia-gravity waves. The results of numerical experiments consistently demonstrate that the dual time stepping coupled with explicitfirst, singly diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta and multigrid methods is more efficient than the three-stage, third-order explicit Runge-Kutta method with comparable accuracy. The numerical experiment also indicates that the dual time stepping is more efficient when a stretched grid is employed. The efficiency in the framework of the dual time stepping is dependent on various numerical factors, including a multigrid level and cycle, Butcher coefficients, an implicit solver and a physical-time step.

AB A space-time domain decomposition approach is presented as a natural extension of the enhanced velocity mixed finite element (EVMFE), introduced by Wheeler et al. in (2002) [26], for spatial domain decomposition. The proposed approach allows for different space-time discretizations on non-overlapping, subdomains by enforcing a mass continuity at non-matching interfaces to preserve local mass conservation inherent to the mixed finite element methods. To this effect, we consider three different model formulations: (1) a linear single phase flow problem, (2) a non-linear slightly compressible flow and tracer transport, and (3) a non-linear slightly compressible, multiphase flow and transport. We also present a numerical solution algorithm for the proposed domain decomposition approach where a monolithic (fully coupled in space and time) system is constructed that does not require subdomain iterations. This space-time EVMFE method accurately resolves advection-diffusion transport features, in a heterogeneous medium, while circumventing non-linear solver convergence issues associated with large time-step sizes for nonlinear problems. Numerical results are presented for the aforementioned, three, model formulations to demonstrate the applicability of this approach to a general class of flow and transport problems in porous media.

AB A new efficient and high-order accurate sharp-interface method for solving the Poisson equation on irregular domains and non-uniform meshes is presented. The approach is based on a combination of a fourth-order compact finite difference scheme and a multiscale multigrid (MSMG) method. The key aspect of the new method is that the regular compact finite difference stencil is modified at the irregular grid points near the immersed boundary to obtain a sharp interface solution while maintaining the formal fourth-order accuracy. The MSMG method is designed based on the standard multigrid V-cycle technique to solve the system of equations derived from the fourth-order compact discretization, while the corresponding multigrid relaxation, restriction and prolongation operators are properly constructed for non-uniform grids with immersed boundaries. The contribution of the present work is the design of a fourth-order-accurate Poisson solver whose accuracy, efficiency and computational cost are independent of the complexity of the geometry and the presence or not of an immersed boundary. The new method is demonstrated and validated for a number of problems including smooth and jagged boundaries. The test cases confirm that the new method is fourth-order accurate in the maximum norm whether an immersed boundary is present or not and on uniform or non-uniform meshes. Furthermore, the computational efficiency of the new method is demonstrated with regard to convergence rate and run time, which shows that the MSMG method is equally efficient for domains with immersed boundaries as for simple domains. The new compact difference method is evaluated by comparison with the standard fourth-order (non-compact) finite difference approximation in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. The new compact difference scheme yields indeed more accurate numerical solutions. The striking difference between the two schemes is the much higher computational efficiency: The number of V-cycles needed to reach the discretization error is significantly lower for the new compact method compared to the standard difference scheme. As a result, the new compact scheme requires only a fraction of the computer time for convergence in comparison to the standard fourth-order difference scheme. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The CRDME was designed to be identical to the popular lattice reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) model for systems with only linear reactions, while overcoming the RDME's loss of bimolecular reaction effects as the lattice spacing is taken to zero. In our original work we developed the CRDME to handle bimolecular association reactions on Cartesian grids. In this work we develop several extensions to the CRDME to facilitate the modeling of cellular processes within realistic biological domains. Foremost, we extend the CRDME to handle reversible bimolecular reactions on unstructured grids. Here we develop a generalized CRDME through discretization of the spatially continuous volume reactivity model, extending the CRDME to encompass a larger variety of particle-particle interactions. Finally, we conclude by examining several numerical examples to demonstrate the convergence and accuracy of the CRDME in approximating the volume reactivity model. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB The dual domain material point method (DDMP) combined with molecular dynamics (MD) is used to simulate a material undergoing a large deformation with a high strain rate. In the simulation, the continuum scale equation of motion is solved using DDMP, while the stresses required at the material points are obtained by performing MD simulations in small domains surrounding the material points following the entire history of the material deformation without reinitialization of the MD systems; therefore the history dependence, a common feature for thermodynamically nonequilibrium systems, can be tracked accurately.
   Two algorithms are introduced to avoid distortion of the MD domains and to ensure consistence in the energy density between the MD and macroscopic calculations. As an example, a hyper-velocity impact problem is simulated. The results of the combined DDMP-MD calculations are compared to a pure MD simulation. The method of the combined simulation is applicable to macroscopic systems, although the size of the simulation domain is only a few hundred nanometers in this example because of the limitation of the pure MD simulation.

AB There exists a growing literature on using the Fokas method (unified transform method) to solve Laplace and Helmholtz problems on convex polygonal domains. We show here that the convexity requirement can be eliminated by the use of a 'virtual side' concept, thereby significantly increasing the flexibility and utility of the approach. We also show that the inclusion of singular functions in the basis to treat corner singularities can greatly increase the rate of convergence of the method. The method also compares well with other standard methods used to cope with corner singularities. An example is given where this inclusion leads to exponential convergence. As well as this, we give new results on several additional issues, including the choice of collocation points and calculation of solutions throughout domain interiors. An appendix illustrates the algebraic simplicity of the methodology by showing how the core part of the present approach can be implemented in only about a dozen lines of MATLAB code.

AB In this work, we provide a method for enhancing stochastic Galerkin moment calculations to the linear elliptic equation with random diffusivity using an ensemble of Monte Carlo solutions. This hybrid approach combines the accuracy of low-order stochastic Galerkin and the computational efficiency of Monte Carlo methods to provide statistical moment estimates which are significantly more accurate than performing each method individually. The hybrid approach involves computing a low-order stochastic Galerkin solution, after which Monte Carlo techniques are used to estimate the residual. We show that the combined stochastic Galerkin solution and residual is superior in both time and accuracy for a one-dimensional test problem and a more computational intensive two-dimensional linear elliptic problem for both the mean and variance quantities.

ID KRYLOV METHODS; INTERPOLATION; ALGORITHM; ITERATION
AB We present an efficient and reliable algorithm for solving a class of nonlinear eigenvalue problems arising from the modeling of particle accelerator cavities. The eigenvalue nonlinearity in these problems results from the use of waveguides to couple external power sources or to allow certain excited electromagnetic modes to exit the cavity. We use a rational approximation to reduce the nonlinear eigenvalue problem first to a rational eigenvalue problem. We then apply a special linearization procedure to turn the rational eigenvalue problem into a larger linear eigenvalue problem with the same eigenvalues, which can be solved by existing iterative methods. By using a compact scheme to represent both the linearized operator and the eigenvectors to be computed, we obtain a numerical method that only involves solving linear systems of equations of the same dimension as the original nonlinear eigenvalue problem. We refer to this method as a compact rational Krylov (CORK) method. We implemented the CORK method in the Omega3P module of the Advanced Computational Electromagnetic 3D Parallel (ACE3P) simulation suite and validated it by comparing the computed cavity resonant frequencies and damping Q factors of a small model problem to those obtained from a fitting procedure that uses frequency responses computed by another ACE3P module called S3P. We also used the CORK method to compute trapped modes damped in an ideal eight 9-cell SRF cavity cryomodule. This was the first time it was possible to compute these modes directly. The damping Q factors of the computed modes match well with those measured in experiments and the difference in resonant frequencies is within the range introduced by cavity imperfection. Therefore, the CORK method is an extremely valuable tool for computational cavity design. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB We investigate the transition to a Landau-Levich-Derjaguin film in forced dewetting using a quadtree adaptive solution to the Navier-Stokes equations with surface tension. We use a discretization of the capillary forces near the receding contact line that yields an equilibrium for a specified contact angle theta(Delta), called the numerical contact angle. Despite the well-known contact line singularity, dynamic simulations can proceed without any explicit additional numerical procedure. We investigate angles from 15 degrees to 110 degrees and capillary numbers from 0.00085 to 0.2 where the mesh size A is varied in the range of 0.0035 to 0.06 of the capillary length l(c), To interpret the results, we use Cox's theory which involves a microscopic distance r(m), and a microscopic angle theta(e). In the numerical case, the equivalent of theta(e) is the angle theta(Delta) and we find that Cox's theory also applies. We introduce the scaling factor or gauge function phi so that r(m) = Delta/phi and estimate this gauge function by comparing our numerics to Cox's theory. The comparison provides a direct assessment of the agreement of the numerics with Cox's theory and reveals a critical feature of the numerical treatment of contact line dynamics: agreement is poor at small angles while it is better at large angles. This scaling factor is shown to depend only on theta(Delta) and the viscosity ratio q. In the case of small theta(e), we use the prediction by Eggers [Phys. Rev. Lett. 93 (2004) 094502] of the critical capillary number for the Landau-Levich-Derjaguin forced dewetting transition. We generalize this prediction to large theta(e) and arbitrary q and express the critical capillary number as a function of theta(e) and r(m). This implies also a prediction of the critical capillary number for the numerical case as a function of theta(Delta) and phi. The theory involves a logarithmically small parameter epsilon = 1/ln(l(c)/r(m)) and is thus of moderate accuracy. The numerical results are however in approximate agreement in the general case, while good agreement is reached in the small theta(Delta) and q case. An analogy can be drawn between the numerical contact angle condition and a regularization of the Navier-Stokes equation by a partial Navier-slip model. The analogy leads to a value for the numerical length scale r(m), proportional to the slip length. Thus the microscopic length found in the simulations is a kind of numerical slip length in the vicinity of the contact line. The knowledge of this microscopic length scale and the associated gauge function can be used to realize grid-independent simulations that could be matched to microscopic physics in the region of validity of Cox's theory.

AB Steady state simulations of magnetized electron fluid equations with strong anisotropic diffusion based on the first-order hyperbolic approach is carried out using cell-centered higher order upwind schemes, linear and weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO). Along with the magnetized electrons, the diffusion equation is also simulated to demonstrate the implementation and design order of the accuracy of the approach due to their similar upwind structure. We show the adequacy of linear upwind schemes for diffusion equation and the use of shock-capturing scheme like WENO does not have any adverse effect on the solution, unlike the total-variation diminishing (TVD) methods. We further extended the approach to advection-diffusion equation, and appropriate boundary conditions have obtained a consistent design accuracy of the third and fifth order. We implemented the WENO approach to advection-diffusion equation by using the split hyperbolic method to demonstrate the advantage of non-oscillatory schemes to capture sharp gradients in boundary layer type problems without spurious oscillations. Finally, numerical results for magnetized electrons simulations indicate that with increasing strength of magnetic confinement it is possible to capture sharp gradients without oscillations by WENO scheme.

AB With Shape Aware Quadratures (SAQ), for a given set of quadrature nodes, order, and domain of integration, the quadrature weights are obtained by solving a system of suitable moment fitting equations in least square sense. The moments in the moment equations are approximated over a simplified domain (Omega(0)) that is a reasonable approximation of the original domain (Omega) that are then corrected for the deviation of the shape of Omega(0) from Omega via shape correction factors. This idea was already successfully utilized in the Adaptively Weighted Numerical Integration (AW) method [1 3], where moments were computed over simplified but homeomorphic domain and then corrected using first-order shape sensitivity, allowing efficient and accurate integration of integrable functions over arbitrary domains.
   With SAQ more general shape correction factors can be derived based on a variety of sensitivity analysis techniques such as shape sensitivity (SSA) and topological sensitivity (TSA). Using the right kind/order of shape correction factors for moment approximation enables the resulting quadrature (from the moment fitting equations) to efficiently adapt to the shape of the original domain even in the presence of thousands of small features.

AB By using non-equispaced grid points near boundaries, we derive boundary optimized first derivative finite difference operators, of orders up to twelve. The boundary closures are based on a diagonal-norm summation-by-parts (SBP) framework, thereby guaranteeing linear stability on piecewise curvilinear multi-block grids. The new operators lead to significantly more efficient numerical approximations, compared with traditional SBP operators on equidistant grids. We also show that the non-uniform grids make it possible to derive operators with fewer one-sided boundary stencils than their traditional counterparts. Numerical experiments with the 2D compressible Euler equations on a curvilinear multi-block grid demonstrate the accuracy and stability properties of the new operators. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is one of the most popular first-order methods to solve optimization problems in large-scale, which has also been widely studied in intelligence system, deep neural networks, or machine learning. In this paper we set out to revisit SGD with practical concerns in mind and hope to provide intuition on how SGD should be done in the right way in applications for expert and intelligence systems.
   In literature, when implementing SGD, regularization is often added to the loss function, to avoid ill-conditioning or overfitting, or to obtain solutions with desirable sparse structure. Intuitively, regularized loss function deviates from the true loss and in this case SGD may lead to a suboptimal solution. In this paper we revisit the matter of l(2) regularization for SGD, to investigate whether or when an explicit regularizer is necessary to obtain the desirable performance. We further introduce a simple stochastic algorithm (ASG) using the accumulated stochastic gradient of the un-regularized loss. Then experiments are carried out on benchmark data sets to validate the theoretical analysis.
   The findings show that for l(2 )regularization, (1) SGD without explicit regularizing (SGDE) actually possesses an implicit regularizer, and in the sense of upper bound of the convergence rate, it outperforms SGD regularized explicitly (SGDER) with a constant advantage; (2) ASG without explicit regularizing outperforms both SGDE and SGDER, especially in the case where the number of iteration T cannot be pre-specified; (3) for SGD algorithms, the schemes that places flexible weight on the output of the latest iteration can give a better trade-off, compared with the scheme using the output of the last iteration or taking the average of the output of each iteration, and this suggests that in application a tunable averaging scheme is preferable.
   This study provides insights on using SGD algorithms for big data applications, e.g., to accelerate SVMs or regularized regression in large-scale, or to improve the performance of online learning or real time forecasting (control). In particular, when T is pre-specified, SGDE (without an explicit regularizer) can give us a well enough perforce with simplicity and understandability; when T cannot be pre-specified, ASG can improve the performance of standard SGD algorithms.

AB The quality of any text mining technique is highly dependent on the features that are used to represent the document collection. A classical form of document representation is the vector space model (VSM), according to which the documents are represented as vectors of weights that correspond to the features of the documents. The bag-of-words model is the most popular VSM approach due to its simplicity and general applicability, but this model does not include term dependency and has a high dimensionality. In the literature, several models for document representation have been proposed in order to capture the dependency of terms. Among them, the topic model representation is one of the most interesting approaches - since it describes the collection of documents in a way that reveals their internal structure and the interrelationships therein, and also provides a dimensionality reduction. However, even for topic models, the efficient extraction of information concerning the relations among terms for document representation is still a major research challenge. In order to address this issue, we proposed thelatent association rule cluster based model (LARCM). The LARCM is a non-probabilistic topic model that makes use of association rule clustering to build a document representation with low dimensionality in such a way that each feature (i.e., topic) is comprised of information concerning relations among the terms. We evaluated the interpretability of the topics obtained by using our proposed model against the ones provided by the traditional latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) model and the LDA model using a document representation that includes correlated terms (i.e., bag-of-related-words). The experimental results indicated that the LARCM provides topics with better interpretability than the LDA models. Additionally, we used the topics obtained by the LARCM in two different applications: text classification and page recommendation. With respect to text classification, the topics were used to improve document collection representation. Concerning page recommendation, topics were used as contextual information in context aware recommender systems. Results have shown that the topics provided by the LARCM can be used to improve both applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Personnel scheduling is a difficult problem with many specific requirements that differ between industries or companies. This paper proposes an Integer Programming (IP) formulation for the staff scheduling problem encountered in practice at an Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system. Two types of heuristics (a diving heuristic and a VNDS heuristic) are implemented and extensively tested on a set of problem instances with different dimensions. Results show that the VNDS heuristic clearly outperforms both the diving heuristic and a state-of-the-art commercial IP solver. It is able to find good quality solutions for realistic problem instances in relatively short computation times. The characteristics that determine the relative difficulty of a problem instance are also investigated. Furthermore, the model is applied to a case study at the Portuguese National Institute for Medical Emergencies. For this purpose, the VNDS heuristic has been implemented in an expert system with an easy-to-use graphical user interface. A number of different schedules proposed by the system are compared with the schedule implemented in practice. This analysis shows that the VNDS heuristic is a significant improvement over the current manual scheduling procedure. Moreover, two what-if scenarios are described to show how the expert system can be used to assist managers in making decisions on contracting additional staff or providing training to workers.

AB Label ranking aims to learn a mapping from instances to rankings over a finite number of predefined labels. Random forest is a powerful and one of the most successful general-purpose machine learning algorithms of modern times. In this paper, we present a powerful random forest label ranking method which uses random decision trees to retrieve nearest neighbors. We have developed a novel two-step rank aggregation strategy to effectively aggregate neighboring rankings discovered by the random forest into a final predicted ranking. Compared with existing methods, the new random forest method has many advantages including its intrinsically scalable tree data structure, highly parallel-able computational architecture and much superior performance. We present extensive experimental results to demonstrate that our new method achieves the highly competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods for datasets with complete ranking and datasets with only partial ranking information.

AB Students learn programming much faster when they receive feedback. However, in programming courses with high student-teacher ratios, it is practically impossible to provide feedback to all homeworks submitted by students. In this paper, we propose a data-driven tool for semi-automatic identification of typical approaches and errors in student solutions. Having a list of frequent errors, a teacher can prepare common feedback to all students that explains the difficult concepts. We present the problem as supervised rule learning, where each rule corresponds to a specific approach or error. We use correct and incorrect submitted programs as the learning examples, where patterns in abstract syntax trees are used as attributes. As the space of all possible patterns is immense, we needed the help of experts to select relevant patterns. To elicit knowledge from the experts, we used the argument-based machine learning (ABML) method, in which an expert and ABML interactively exchange arguments until the model is good enough. We provide a step-by-step demonstration of the ABML process, present examples of ABML questions and corresponding expert's answers, and interpret some of the induced rules. The evaluation on 42 Prolog exercises further shows the usefulness of the knowledge elicitation process, as the models constructed using ABML achieve significantly better accuracy than the models learned from human-defined patterns or from automatically extracted patterns.

AB This paper proposes an improved version of the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) based on the opposition-based learning (OBL) strategy called OBLGOA for solving benchmark optimization functions and engineering problems. The proposed OBLGOA algorithm consists of two stages: the first stage generates an initial population and its opposite using the OBL strategy; and the second stage uses the OBL as an additional phase to update the GOA population in each iteration. However, the OBL is applied to only half of the solutions to reduce the time complexity. To investigate the performance of the proposed OBLGOA, six sets of experiment series are performed, and they include twenty-three benchmark functions and four engineering problems. The experiments revealed that the results of the proposed algorithm were superior to those of ten well-known algorithms in this domain. Eventually, the obtained results proved that the OBLGOA algorithm can provide competitive results for optimization engineering problems compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB Emotion recognition through facial expressions represents a relevant way to understand and even predict the human behavior. Thus, it has been used in various fields such as human-robot interaction and ambient assistance. Nevertheless, it remains a challenging task since expressed emotions might be affected by different parameters such as ethnic origins, age and so on. In this paper, we introduce an efficient facial expression recognition approach based on a Convolutional Neural Network architecture. Carried experimentation on five benchmark facial expression datasets confirms the efficiency of the proposed approach with recognition rates higher than 95%. In the context of ambient assistance, we introduced an error detection module using a user action recognition from Radio Frequency IDentification tags placed on various objects of daily living. The experiments performed in a smart environment show a consistent improvement of the error detection module when including facial expression recognition. Indeed, the false positive detection rate is significantly reduced by over 20%. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Currently, modeling and analyzing timed compatibility of Petri net based mediation-aided Web service composition by model checking are attracting increasing attention in the expert and intelligent systems community. However, existing methods cannot handle mediation-aided Web service composition involving complex mediation transitions, suffer from low efficiency owing to the larger size of time automata (TA) models, or are unable to automatically check temporal constraints whose activities do not include exchanged messages by observing TA. In this paper, we present a novel three-stage approach for analyzing timed compatibility of mediation-aided Web service composition via model checking. First, stage 1 treats each service in Petri net based mediation-aided Web service composition as a fragment. Second, stage 2 transforms fragments into a time automata net (TAN) based on structure transformation and interactive message transformation. Finally, stage 3 checks all types of temporal constraints. The main impact of our approach on expert and intelligent systems involves the following aspects: 1) mediation-aided service composition with complex mediation transitions can be dealt with; 2) compact TAN can be constructed for fragments in which the number of states and arcs is dramatically decreased and the verification time is extremely reduced compared with existing methods; and 3) temporal constraints whose activities have or do not have exchanged messages can be located in TAN. The main significance of our approach in the field of expert and intelligent systems is that it can greatly reduce the risk of making business decisions and the cost of handling temporal violations, and improves the innovation capability of enterprises.

AB In this paper, a secure blind image watermarking scheme is proposed to improve efficiency of hybrid Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based schemes. The main contribution of this research is using two-level singular value decomposition in hybrid DWT+SVD watermarking schemes results to high improvement in both imperceptibility and robustness. Also, security is ensured in this scheme by proposing a two-level authentication system for watermark extraction in which not only the false positive problem is eliminated, when the attacks are very severe, the false negative effect is also detected and prevented. In the proposed scheme, the cover image is initially transformed to DWT and the high frequency sub bands are selected. Subsequently, High (HH) sub band is divided into 8 x 8 non overlapping blocks and the SVD transform is applied to each of them. In SVD transform, the highest energy compaction is in the first row and the first column of the matrix of singular values. These singular values for each block will be collected in a separate matrix and then the second SVD transform will be exerted on the produced matrix. The singular values of the watermark image after exerting one level DWT, is embedded into the singular values of this matrix. Experimental result shows when the scheme is subjected to ten most common types of signal processing and geometric attacks, using the second level of SVD makes it highly robust and imperceptible while it is independent from type of image. So, the proposed scheme is tested and certified for both medical and normal images. This scheme is compared to a range of hybrid schemes using DWT and one level SVD, and experimental results show high improvements in imperceptibility with the average of 46.6950 db and robustness more than 99% and proven efficiency in security.

AB The outlier relies on its distinctive mechanism and valuable information to play an important role in expert and intelligent systems, and thus outlier detection has already been extensively applied in relevant fields including the fraud detection, medical diagnosis, public security, etc. The outlier detection methods of rough sets recently gain in-depth research, because they are data-driven and never require additional knowledge. However, classical rough set-based methods consider only categorical data; furthermore, neighborhood rough sets adhere to numeric and heterogeneous data, but their outlier detection is mainly restricted to numeric data now. According to the hybrid data-driving, this paper investigates outlier detection by the neighborhood information entropy and its developmental measures, and the applicable data sets widely concern categorical, numeric, and mixed data; as a result, the new method extends both the traditional distance-based and rough set-based methods to enrich outlier detection. Concretely, the neighborhood information system is first determined by the heterogeneous distance and self-adapting radius, the neighborhood information entropy is then defined to implement whole uncertainty measurement, three gradual information measures are further constructed to describe each single object, and finally the neighborhood entropy-based outlier factor (NEOF) is integratedly established to detect outliers; moreover, the NEOF-based outlier detection algorithm (called the NIEOD algorithm) is designed and applied. By virtue of UCI data experiments, the NIEOD algorithm is compared with six existing detection algorithms (including the NED, IE, SEQ FindCBLOF, DIS, KNN algorithms), and the concrete results generally reflect the better effectiveness and adaptability of the new method.

DE Probabilistic frequent itemset; Uncertain data stream; Uncertain
   database; Data stream mining
AB This paper considers the problem of mining probabilistic frequent itemsets in the sliding window of an uncertain data stream. We design an effective in-memory index named PFIT to store the data synopsis, so the current probabilistic frequent itemsets can be output in real time. We also propose a depth-first algorithm, PFIMoS, to bottom-up build and maintain the PFIT dynamically. Because computing the probabilistic support is time consuming, we propose a method to estimate the range of probabilistic support by using the support and expected support, which can greatly reduce the run-time and memory usage. Nevertheless, massive probabilistic supports have to be computed when the minimum support is low over dense data, which may result in a drastic reduction of computing speed. We further address this problem with a heuristic rule-based algorithm, PFIMoS+, in which an error parameter is introduced to decrease the probabilistic support computing count. Theoretical analysis and experimental studies demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can efficiently reduce computing time and memory, ensure fast and exact mining of probabilistic data streams, and markedly outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms TODIS-Stream (Sun et al., 2010) and FEMP (Akbarinia & Masseglia, 2013).

DE Resource2Vec embedding; Linked Data; Term discovery; Out-of-vocabulary

AB In this work we present a neural network embedding we call Resource2Vec, which is able to represent the resources that make up some Linked Data (LD) corpora. A vector representation of these resources allows more advantageous processing (in computational terms) as is the case with known word or document embeddings. We give a quantitative analysis for their study. Furthermore, we employ them in an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task to demonstrate their functionality by designing a strategy for term discovery. This strategy permits out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms in a Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (LVCSR) system to be discovered and then put into the final transcription. First, we detect where a potential OOV term may have been uttered in the LVCSR output speech segments. Second, we carry out a candidate OOV search in some LD corpora. This search is oriented by distance measurements between the transcription context around the potential-OOV speech segment and the resources of the LD corpora in Resource2Vec format, obtaining a set of candidates. To rank them, we mainly depend on the phone transcription of that segment. Finally, we decide whether or not to incorporate a candidate into the final transcription. The results show we are able to improve the transcription in Word Error Rate (WER) terms significantly, after our strategy is used on speech in Spanish. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Teaching by demonstrations; Inverse reinforcement learning; Interactive
   learning; Human evaluative feedbacks
AB Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is a powerful tool for teaching by demonstrations, provided that sufficiently diverse and optimal demonstrations are given, and learner agent correctly perceives those demonstrations. These conditions are hard to meet in practice; as a trainer cannot cover all possibilities by demonstrations, he may partially fail to follow the optimal behavior. Also, trainer and learner have different perceptions of the environment including trainer's actions. A practical way to overcome these problems is using a combination of trainer's demonstrations and feedbacks.
   We propose an interactive learning approach to overcome the challenge of non-optimal demonstrations by integrating human evaluative feedbacks with the IRL process, given sufficiently diverse demonstrations and the domain transition model. To this end, we develop a probabilistic model of human feedbacks and iteratively improve the agent policy using Bayes rule. We then integrate this information in an extended IRL algorithm to enhance the learned reward function.
   We examine the developed approach in one experimental and two simulated tasks; i.e., a grid world navigation, a highway car driving system and a navigation task by the e-puck robot. Obtained results show significant improved efficiency of the proposed approach in face of having different levels of non-optimality in demonstrations and the number of evaluative feedbacks.

AB We introduce an extension to Multiple Classification Ripple Down Rules (MCRDR), called Contextual MCRDR (C-MCRDR). We apply C-MCRDR knowledge-base systems (KBS) to the Textual Question Answering (TQA) and Natural Language Interface to Databases (NLIDB) paradigms in restricted domains as a type of spoken dialog system (SDS) or conversational agent (CA). C-MCRDR implicitly maintains topical conversational context, and intra-dialog context is retained allowing explicit referencing in KB rule conditions and classifications. To facilitate NLIDB, post-inference C-MCRDR classifications can include generic query referencing - query specificity is achieved by the binding of pre-identified context. In contrast to other scripted, or syntactically complex systems, the KB of the live system can easily be maintained courtesy of the RDR knowledge engineering approach. For evaluation, we applied this system to a pedagogical domain that uses a production database for the generation of offline course-related documents. Our system complemented the domain by providing a spoken or textual question-answering alternative for undergraduates based on the same production database. The developed system incorporates a speech-enabled chatbot interface via Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and experimental results from a live, integrated feedback rating system showed significant user acceptance, indicating the approach is promising, feasible and further work is warranted. Evaluation of the prototype's viability found the system responded appropriately for 80.3% of participant requests in the tested domain, and it responded inappropriately for 19.7% of requests due to incorrect dialog classifications (4.4%) or out of scope requests (15.3%). Although the semantic range of the evaluated domain was relatively shallow, we conjecture that the developed system is readily adoptable as a CA NLIDB tool in other more semantically-rich domains and it shows promise in single or multi-domain environments.

AB Open information extraction (Open IE) is a task for extracting relationship triples in plain texts without previously determining these relationships. The Open IE systems are generally applied to solutions on the web-scale such improving question answering systems, ontology constructions, document filtering and clustering. Since 2007, within the first Open IE system TEXTRUNNER, other related works have been proposed in this area. Despite other secondary studies on Open IE, useful information available to initiate new research in the area is limited. Thus, we propose a review of the literature in Open IE by a systematic mapping study. We have retrieved 2484 articles about Open IE in Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Scopus and Google Scholar databases. Among them, 2411 were filtered by exclusion criteria proposed in our systematic mapping protocol. The remaining 73 papers represent the state-of-the-art from the past seven years. Different researchers have proposed important contributions and have pointed out some open problems for Open IE. As a result, we summarized these contributions and identified significant gaps that could be envisioned as future works. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The size, composition, and atomic distribution of bimetallic clusters influence their structural transformations, so knowledge of these parameters is important to obtain clusters with better properties. The structural transformation from cuboctahedral to icosahedral in cobalt (Co)-based bimetallic clusters was examined using molecular dynamics simulations with an embedded atom method. The results showed that size-dependent structural transformation only occurs in Co-based clusters with a small size (atomic number less than 1415). The structural transformation is diffusionless and occurs instantaneously. The structural transformation is induced by the release of energy and is related to the size, composition, and atomic distribution of the clusters. The transformation temperature rises with increasing copper (Cu) content and cluster size. The core-shell Co-Cu structure displayed a higher transformation temperature and lower released energy than those of the equivalent cluster with a uniform element distribution. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI Unusual grain coarsening behavior of bismuth under high pressure
SO MATERIALS LETTERS

DT Article
DE Crystal growth; Metals and alloys; Crystal structure; Phase
   transformation; Recrystallization; X-ray techniques
AB It is well known the atomic diffusion caused by high temperature leads to conspicuous grain coarsening, which is of crucial importance to the properties of materials. High pressure usually slows down the diffusion rate of atoms and refines the grain size. In this study, using synchrotron angle dispersive x-ray diffraction (ADXRD) techniques, we observed an abnormal grain coarsening behavior of bismuth (Bi) stemming from the high pressure phase transition at room temperature, demonstrating that the grain coarsening can also be triggered by pressure. Two factors mainly give raise to this unusual coarsening behavior of Bi: (1) the nucleation rate of new phase is very slow during transformation according to the kinetics study of the phase transition in Bi, which inhibits the grain refinement; (2) the liquid interphase in the phase transition process enables the recrystallization of Bi under high pressure. Our experiment results are consistent with the previous theoretical calculations, which is crucial for describing the nucleation and growth process and clarifying the phase transition mechanisms in Bi.

AB This study examines the rate of grain size reduction as a function of the volume of Cu powder subjected to ball milling and ball drop experiments at constant impact energy. For volumes between 1.6 x 10 (3) and 3 cm(3), the grain size decreases exponentially from about 300 to 19 nm and the rate constant is inversely proportional to the volume of powder. This suggests that the volume of powder undergoing grain size reduction in a given impact is approximately the same, about 7.4 x 10 (7) cm(3), for ball milling and ball drop experiments and it is independent of the total volume of the powder.

AB Developing an effective layer-controllable fabrication technique for two-dimensional materials is crucial, as numerous novel properties are closely related to the varying layers and the artificial nanostructures. To achieve this goal, a novel technique was proposed based on the model between the phase variation and the characteristic parameters of the material. Based on the theoretical estimation and fabrications related to the phase information, cutting with controllable layers and sharp edges was achieved on monolayer and multilayer MoS2 nanosheets. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our method and suggest its potential for wide application in the future. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB epsilon-Ga2O3 has a polar crystal structure with non-inversion-symmetry along the direction of the c-axis. In a previous study, the ferroelectric hysteresis loop of epsilon-Ga2O3 was successfully measured using a planarplate capacitor comprising a thick epsilon-Ga2O3 layer (3 mu m). Herein, we aim to enhance the ferroelectric properties of epsilon-Ga2O3 to allow ferroelectric measurements to be conducted with a lower maximum applied voltage and a higher measurement frequency as compared with previous studies. We successfully observed ferroelectric hysteresis loops of orthorhombic epsilon-Ga2O3 thin (250 nm) films grown on SnO2 conductive layers on c-sapphire substrates. Moreover, the smooth-surface morphology and improved crystal quality induced ferroelectric properties in the epsilon-Ga2O3 thin films grown at 750 degrees C. This material was used to facilitate ferroelectric measurements at a relatively high frequency of 1 kHz with a maximum applied electric field of 0.38 MV/cm and a small remnant polarization (2Pr = 7.6 nC/c m(2)) at room temperature.

AB Highly crystalline zinc silicate (Zn2SiO4) nanorods have been synthesized by a cost-effective low-temperature hydrothermal route. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the crystalline willemite Zn2SiO4 phase of nanorods. The average diameter and length of nanorods were found to be 50 nm and 1-2.5 mu m, respectively in electron microscopy studies. An absorption band in the range of 200-300 nm and a significant reduction in the optical band (5.05 eV) gap was observed in UV-Vis studies. Zn2SiO4 nanorods exhibited a very high dielectric constant of about 270 which is almost ten fold higher than that of bulk Zn2SiO4. Observation of high dielectric constant and band gap reduction makes Zn2SiO4 nanorods suitable for optoelectronics, phosphors and various nano-electronics devices applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB This work reports the fabrication of AgSbS2 semiconductor films via in-situ gas-solid reaction approach, including sequential solution-deposition of AgNO3 and SbCl3 percursor solutions on mesoporous TiO2 substrates, and subsequent sulfurization of the prepared films at H2S atmosphere. The resultant TiO2/AgSbS2 films show broad spectral absorption ranged from 350 nm to 800 nm with a band gap of 2.01 eV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra confirm the fabrication of phase-pure AgSbS2 without any impurity. Furthermore, the devices with a structure of fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO)/TiO2/AgSbS2/Au have been prepared, exhibiting quick interfacial charge transfer and electron injection process with excellent photoresponse and high photostability.

   COMPOSITES; BEHAVIOR
AB Materials with an ultra-low dielectric constant (epsilon) have been the topic of much interest because they are widely used in integrated circuits and high frequency devices. Pores (epsilon = 1) have been generally introduced in materials to reduce their epsilon to below 2. In this work, an alternative but highly facile method is introduced to create ultra-low epsilon materials based on interfacial effects in nanocomposites. Typical nanocomposites, polyethylene/silica nanoparticle composites, were prepared by mechanical blending and hot-pressing. The composite's epsilon was dramatically decreased from 2.50 to 1.90 when incorporating 8 wt% silica. This epsilon value was much lower than the low extreme of predicted epsilon. The porosities of the composites are below 1%, indicating that the ultra-low epsilon is not a result of a porous structure. Instead, this ultra-low epsilon was found to be correlated with dielectric confinement effect of silica nanoparticles or crystalline rearrangement caused by interfacial effect. The interfacial effect was evidenced by the change of epsilon with loading ratios of silica and pressures, and a nanoparticle-induced crystallization. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present manuscript reports the development of Ag/cellulose fibers/Al memory device using the electrospinning technique. The morphological characterization suggested that the active layer is composed of micro-fibers. The developed device shows fingerprint pinched hysteresis loop of the memristive device in I-V plane without any additional electroforming step. An excellent endurance for 6 x 10(3) resistive switching cycles with 10x memory window is achieved. Furthermore, the data retention capability of the developed device is extended for the 3 x 10(2) seconds without any observable degradation in the resistance states. The statistical results suggested that the high resistance state loosely distributed whereas tight distribution is observed for low resistance state. The electrical characterization results suggested that the formation and breaking of Ag conductive filament in the active cellulose fiber layer are responsible for the bipolar resistive switching effect. Our results suggested that the cellulose fibers based memristive device is a potential candidate for the organic non-volatile memory application. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We exposed hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) with Ba3N2 and MgB2 to supercritical ammonia at 750 degrees C and 120 MPa. Analysis by X-ray diffraction indicates that the product is a mixture of h-BN and rhombohedral boron nitride (r-BN), and triangular-plate crystals appear in the product. Hexagonal BN and r-BN are also obtained when Ba3N2 and MgB2 are exposed to supercritical ammonia. When h-BN is exposed to supercritical ammonia without Ba3N2 and MgB2, the crystal structure and morphology of h-BN does not change. The results thus reveal that r-BN forms upon ammonothermal treatment with Ba3N2 and MgB2. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel organic Schiff base nonlinear optical material 4-Nitro-benzoic acid (3-ethoxy-2-hydroxy-benzyli dene)-hydrazide (NEH) was synthesized and grown as single crystal by slow evaporation technique. The structure and unit cell parameter of NEH was confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and the crystal belongs to orthorhombic crystal system with noncentrosymmetric space group Pna2(1). Further both carbon and hydrogen NMR spectra confirm the formation of material and the presence of functional group was analyzed by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis. The optical absorption spectrum of the grown crystal shows the material has lower cut off wavelength at 320 nm. Thermal property of NEH was studied by TG/DTA analysis. The second harmonic nonlinear efficiency was accessed by Kurtz-Perry powder technique and it possesses an efficiency of 0.7 times that of standard KDP. The laser damage threshold of NEH crystal was found to be 3.22 GW/cm(2). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To study the dynamic behavior and microstructural evolution in high strain rate deformation of Ti-5Al5Mo-5V-1Cr-1Fe (Ti-55511) alloy, a series of forced shear tests of hat shaped specimens have been conducted using a split Hopkinson pressure bar combined with "strain frozen" technique. Localized shear band is induced in these tests. This paper indicates that the flow stress of Ti-55511 alloy is independent on the punching depth, and thermal softening has a minor effect on the onset of adiabatic shear band and dynamic recrystallization formation. The concept of "adhesive fracture" can be identified as the dynamic failure mechanism for Ti-55511 alloy based on the crack propagation path. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Simplifying the manufacturing of metal matrix composites (MMCs) will allow for their wider use in applications that require lower density, higher strength, and high wear resistance when compared to traditional metals. An in-situ method of MMC formation is proposed, using a binder jet additive manufacturing (BJ-AM) process with only Inconel 625 powder and a carbon-containing binder. Carbide formation occurs at elevated temperatures during sintering by combining Cr, Mo and Nb alloying elements in Inconel 625 and carbon from the binder. The core-shell morphology and composition of the final MMC is tuned by controlling the quantity of carbon in the system during the sintering step. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water soluble based copolymer poly(potassium 1-hydroxy acrylate-co-potassium acrylate) i.e. P(KHA-co-KA) and poly(1-oxa-2-oxobutane-1,4:3,3-tetrayl)/potassium 1-hydroxy acrylate-co-potassium acrylate) i.e. P(LAC/KHA-co-KA) were synthesized by radical polymerization of 2-isopropyl-5-methylene-1,3-dioxolan-4-one (MD) and acrylic acid (AA) monomers followed by alkaline ring opening hydrolysis of P(MD-co-AA). The P(KHA-co-KA) copolymer generates a new lactone segment by the intramolecular cyclodehydration of two neighbouring groups in the presence of acidic condition, resulting P(LAC/KHA-co-KA) copolymer. This change enhances the thermal properties of P(LAC/KHA-co-KA) copolymer as compared to P(KHA-co-KA) copolymer. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB ZnO thin films were grown on (11 (2) over bar0) sapphire substrate with a ZnO buffer layer using the hydrothermal method, under atmospheric pressure. The surface of the ZnO film was visualized with SEM. The wurtzite crystalline structure and preferred (0001) orientation of the ZnO film was observed with X-ray diffraction. Raman scatterings and photoluminescence verified the low density of impurities and defects. The overall test results demonstrated that the proposed method simply and effectively synthesized high-quality ZnO film. The influence of the precursor concentration on their morphologies and properties were investigated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, preparation of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) quantum dots (QDs) decorated reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposite by a simple and nontoxic solution method is reported. Structure and morphology of CZTS QDs, rGO and prepared composite have been analysed through XRD, TEM, Raman, XPS, UV-Vis and FESEM. Improvement in current in CZTS QDs-rGO composite compared to CZTS QDs could be attributed to the separation of electron-hole pairs generated in QDs and their rapid transfer to the surface of graphene sheets. This result suggests that the prepared composite could be used as promising materials for solar cell. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) can be produced with different purity levels that were hypothesized to alter water uptake and overall stability. Two purity GOS levels (55% and 90%) in commercially available mixtures were analyzed. Water was found to plasticize GOS (more effectively in the 55% compared to 90% GOS mixture), decreasing the glass transition temperature (Tg) causing the caking of powders and collapse of the amorphous structure. The critical a w for the 55% GOS mixture was between a(w) 0.23 and 0.33, corresponding to 3.7 and 5.9% moisture, and for the 90% GOS the critical a w was between a(w) 0.43 and 0.58, corresponding to 9.7 and 13.0% moisture. Differential thermogravimetric (DTG) curves demonstrated that water was more homogenous and difficult to remove as the Tg of GOS fell below storage temperature. DTG trends suggest that this analysis may be used to predict Tg of GOS mixtures, which is influenced by GOS purity level.

AB The varietal thiols 3-mercaptohexan-1-ol (3MH), 3-mercaptohexyl acetate (3MHA), and 4-mercapto-4-methyl-pentan-2-one (4MMP) are key aroma compounds in wine due to the tropical notes they impart. They are released by yeast during alcoholic fermentation from different precursors. However, a large part of 3MH origin remains unknown. In this study, we focused on dipeptide forms arising from glutathione S-conjugates to 3MH and 4MMP. Using labelled tracers, we showed in spiked must the release of varietal thiols from 4 different compounds. We highlighted the interconversion between different forms of precursors under defined enological conditions. Cysteinyl-glycine S-conjugates are partially degraded into cysteine S-conjugates, contrary to.-glutamyl-cysteine S-conjugates. Glutathione S-conjugate to 3MH can be partially degraded to.-glutamyl-cysteine S-conjugate to 3MH. For the first time, all these labeled forms of precursors were found to release 3MH or 4MMP between 0.17 and 1% molar conversion yield. Two different yeasts were compared without any significant difference.

AB In view of climate change, the scheduling of an early harvest may be an agronomic option to limit wine alcohol, provided that a satisfactory content of secondary metabolites can be ensured in grapes. To better understand the link between grape ripening, seasonal trend and wine aroma, the aromatic expression of Barbera and Pinot Noir wines produced with early harvested grapes was assessed. Attention was focused on C13 norisoprenoids during both alcoholic fermentation and after three months of storage. At the end of fermentation, the highest beta-damascenone content was detected in wines obtained from less ripe grapes, the content subsequently increased significantly after three months of storage; however, the levels of beta-ionone decreased significantly during the same period. The reduction of wine alcohol as a result of harvesting earlier, especially for Barbera, was associated with optimal aromatic levels as well as good technological parameters.

AB Phenolic composition and antioxidant capacity of 20 oat genotypes differing in hull color were investigated. Phenolic aldehydes, phenolic acids, avenanthramides and mono-, and diglycerides were identified in the soluble phenolic fraction of the genotypes. The bound phenolic fraction proved to be less diverse with phenolic aldehydes, phenolic acids and a ferulic acid dehydrodimer detected. Investigating the scavenging capacity of the hull and groat toward 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), an increased antioxidant activity (AOA) of hull compared to groats and a color dependence of the hull AOA could be observed. Principal component analysis on the determined variables revealed that the black-hulled samples were different from the white ones due to their increased phenolic content detected in the hull. However, reddish-hulled varieties were grouping with the accessions of the other colored groups. In addition, a distinction between spring and winter cultivars was also observed.

AB In general, the reducing sugars were extensively utilized as additives to prevent denaturation and inactivation during the freeze-drying process. However, different additives have unequal protective effects on the protein conformation. To evaluate the mechanism of protection the protein structure using different additives in the freeze-drying process, the glycated sites and degree of substitution per peptide (DSP) of each site were investigated by LC-Orbitrap MS. We found that the ovalbumin that was supplemented with ribose and then lyophilized (R-oval) have the highest extent of glycation modification. K227 was the most reactive glycated site in R-Oval, with a DSP of 0.83. The ovalbumin that was supplemented with lactose and then lyophilized (L-Oval) have the lowest degree of glycation, and K227 did not undergo the glycation reaction. It was hypothesized that the order impact of different additives on protection of the protein conformation were lactose > galactose > ribose during the freeze-drying process.

AB The inhibitive effects of chitosan on black rot disease caused by Ceratocystis fimbriata in sweet potato tuber root (TR) were evaluated. The results demonstrated that chitosan effectively inhibited the mycelial growth and spore germination of C. fimbriata and directly led to the cell necrosis. Chitosan altered the chitin deposition and influenced the fatty acid composition of C. fimbriata. The application of chitosan effectively controlled the C. fimbriata development in sweet potato TRs 17 days of storage 25 degrees C. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were clearly enhanced by the chitosan treatment, while the malondialdehyde (MDA) production was not increased. These findings suggest that chitosan effectively controlled the infection of C. fimbriata in sweet potato TRs owing to its antifungal and eliciting properties, which induced some defense responses during storage.

AB This study was designed to characterize the phenolic profile and bioactivity of hydroalcoholic extracts from different cardoon (Cynara cardunculus L.) genotypes. The analytical work focussed on the inflorescence stigmas, owing to their application in cheese production. Nevertheless, other parts were concomitantly analysed aiming to define their possible use in related applications. Phenolic profiles obtained by LC-DAD-ESI/MSn showed significant differences among different cardoon genotypes, but apigenin and caffeoylquinic acid derivatives were generally the major molecules in all samples. Genotype influence has also been observed in relation to the antioxidant and antibacterial activities. Besides their strong antioxidant activity, the cardoon inflorescences showed satisfactory antibacterial activity, namely against Gram-positive strains, with particularly low MIC in Listeria monocytogenes. Overall, it was possible to identify the cardoon genotype (within the selected ones) providing the best standardized ingredient (stigma) with considerable added-value to be included in the process of cheese making.

AB The chemical composition (CC), antioxidant capacity (AC) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of 36 different commercial tannins were measured. The CC was analyzed by total polyphenol index, Bate-Smith, methyl-cellulose, Folin-Ciocalteu, OIV official method and phloroglucinolisis. The AC was measured by different methods (ABTS, CUPRAC, DPPH, FRAP, ORAC) using Trolox as standard. The OCR was measured using a non-invasive method based on luminescence. The results indicate that it is possible to obtain differentiation between procyanidins/prodelphinidins, profisetinidins/prorobinetidins, gallotannins and ellagitannins by PCA based on their CC data. It is also possible to separate condensed from hydrolysable tannins by PCA based on their AC data. The results show that ellagitannins are the fastest oxygen consumers of the various oenological tannins, followed in descending order by condensed tannins and finally gallotannins. The combination of CC, AC and OCR analyses enable to classify tannins according to their effectiveness in protecting wines against oxidation.

AB A series of sorbic and benzoic acid amide derivatives were synthesized by conjugating sorbic acid (SAAD, a(l)-a(7)) or benzoic acid (BAAD b(1)-b(6)) with amino acid esters and their antimicrobial activities were investigated against Escherichia coll., Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, mixed bacteria from rancid milk, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Aspergillus niger. The antimicrobial activity of sorbic acid amides was better than that of benzoic acid amides. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of compound isopropyl N-[1-oxo-2, 4-hexadien-1-yl]-L-phenylalaninate (a(7)) were 0.17 mM against B. subtilis, and 0.50 mM against S. aureus, while the MIC values of sorbic acid were more than 2 mM respectively. Also, compound a(7) displayed pH-independent antimicrobial activity in the range of pH 5.0-9.0 and was effective at pH 9.0. These results demonstrated that the conjugation of sorbic acid with amino acid esters led to significant improvement of in vitro antimicrobial attributes, but little effect was observed for benzoic acid amide derivatives.

AB A deoxynivalenol (DON) epitope clone (D-8) was obtained by phage display technology using anti-DON monoclonal antibodies as a target molecule. Subsequently, a DON antigen mimic (D-8-maltose-binding protein [MBP]) was synthesized by fusing the mimic epitope peptide with MBP. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and urchin-like gold nanoparticle immunochromatographic assay was developed based on D-8-MBP for detection of DON in maize and wheat. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration, lower detection limit, and linear range of the D-8-MBP ELISA were 57.98 +/- 0.97, 9.83, and 11.32-286.77 ng/mL, respectively. The sensitivity of the D-8-MBP ELISA was nearly 2.5 times higher than that of traditional ELISA using DON-bovine serum albumin (BSA). The detection threshold of the colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay for D-8-MBP was 25 ng/mL. Thus, D-8-MBP could be used to replace the traditional DON-BSA antigen for the immunological detection of DON, permitting low cost, rapid detection of DON.

AB Effects of different setting temperatures (40-70 degrees C) on properties of goat meat gels after heating at 90 degrees C were investigated. Setting at 60 degrees C with subsequent heating at 90 degrees C yielded the gel with the highest breaking force along with coincidentally lowest expressible moisture content (p < 0.05). The highest TCA-soluble peptide content was found in gel set at 70 degrees C (p < 0.05). Slight decrease in myosin heavy chain band intensity was noticeable when setting temperature increased. As setting temperatures increased, a* and b*-values of gels generally increased, while L*-values decreased (p < 0.05). Gel set at 60 degrees C had highest hardness, gumminess and chewiness (p < 0.05). Gel set a 60 degrees C had the most compact network with immense connectivity of protein strands. Gels set at 40-60 degrees C had higher texture and overall likeness scores, compared to the control (p < 0.05). Prior setting at 60 degrees C was recommended for making the good quality goat meat gel.

AB The aim of this study was to determine the insecticide residue processing factor (PF) from plums to prunes and the effect of the industrial processing of prunes residue concentrations. Our results show an increase of insecticide concentrations during plum dehydration that is explained by fruit water loss; however, the normalized insecticide residue concentration, based on plum dry weights to compensate dehydration, was reduced. The water washing and tenderizing of prunes produced insecticide residue reductions of 22.9 +/- 4.5% and 21.9 +/- 4.2%, respectively. PF were: 1.157, 1.872, 1.316, 0.192, 2.198, 0.775 and 0.156 for buprofezin, L-cyhalothrin, spirodiclofen, indoxacarb, acetamiprid, imidacloprid and emamectin benzoate, respectively, being directly related to water solubility, aqueous hydrolysis and degradation point and inversely related to molecular mass and melting point. In plums for the dehydrated agroindustry the final product is prunes, therefore, it is crucial to consider the PF to determine the specific preharvest interval for this important agroindustry.

AB In this study, leftover egg yolk granules, a by-product after phosvitin extraction, were evaluated for the physicochemical and functional properties and the results were compared with those of the egg yolk and whole granule with phosvitin. Leftover granule after phosvitin removal accounted for 12.6% of the dried egg yolk and contained 84.5% protein and 7.98% fat. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of leftover granules indicated the dissociation of aggregates of high density lipoprotein-phosvitin complexes. Protein solubility of leftover granules was markedly influenced by pH and sodium chloride (0.5 and 1 M). The apparent viscosity of leftover granule was higher than egg yolk and whole granule. Compared to whole granule, leftover granule had significantly (P < 0.05) superior foaming and emulsifying properties, but, lower than those of egg yolk. These findings are useful for the food industry for utilization of leftover egg yolk granules for the preparation of various food products.

AB The potential and practicality of FTNIR as a screening tool, with ward's algorithms, was performed for two different varieties of rice namely, 'badshah bhog' and 'swarna', followed by cluster, dendrogram, histogram, and conformity analysis with different storage periods (0-225) and insect infestation. Dendrogram analysis resulted in a clear differentiation between infested rice varieties with non-infested ones while hierarchical cluster analysis, lead to detection of different levels of infestations. Histograms analysis of averaged FTINR spectra of rice grains samples provided 100% classification between infested and non-infested samples. Dissimilarities between rice grains were calculated using Pearson's correlation coefficients which were further converted to D values, and heterogeneity among the different varieties of rice along with a different level of infestation was identified. The results further revealed that the percentage accuracy (%) of classification for badshah bhog varied from 93.10 to 98.84%, while that for the swarna rice was between 95.75 and 99.74%.

AB A paper spray mass spectrometry (PS-MS) method has been developed for the rapid quantification of benzoic acid (BA) and vitamin C (VC) in beverages. Using BA-d5 as an internal standard (IS) to analyze BA and VC, the calibration curves ranged from 0.3 to 100 mu g/mL for BA and 1 to 100 mu g/mL for VC, the linearly was 0.9996 for BA and 0.9973 for VC. The limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantization (LOQs) were 0.1 mu g/mL and 0.3 mu g/mL for BA, 0.3 mu g/mL and 1 mu g/mL for VC, respectively. The recovery ranged from 91.1 to 106.7% for BA, 92.6 to 108.2% for VC. Compared with HPLC, there is no substantial difference in the quantification of BA and VC in samples, the accuracy was 95.7-102.2%, and the run time is far less than that of the HPLC method. The results indicated that PS-MS is a rapid, environmentally friendly and high-throughput method for the quantification of BA and VC.

AB As a potential novel technique in the wine-making industry, ultrasound has received considerable attention. In this paper, a model wine system was constructed to investigate the effect of ultrasonic irradiation on the formation of xanthylium cation pigment derived from the ( + )-catechin and the glyoxylic acid, an oxidation product of tartaric acid, so as to explore the changing mechanism of the wine color mediated by ultrasound. The results indicate that the long-term ultrasonic treatment can enhance the formation of the xanthylium cation pigment in the model wine, which is attributed to free radicals triggered by ultrasound, meanwhile, iron ions and oxygen can influence the ultrasonic effect. All these results suggest that ultrasound is promising to be employed in regulating the formation of the yellow pigment during wine aging thus modifying the wine organoleptic characteristic.

AB Microalgae have already shown their potential as an alternative source of n-3 LC-PUFA. In this study, 5 different microalgal species (Isochrysis, Nannochloropsis, Phaeodactylum, Porphyridium and Schizochytrium) were added to an acidic model system and screened on their potential use in acidic food matrices. The impact of mechanical and thermal processing on the model systems was studied by analyzing the amount of n-3 LC PUFA, free fatty acids, carotenoids, lipid polymers and the oxidative stability. A (limited) reduction of n-3 LC PUFA was observed. Thermal alterations combined with the presence of free fatty acids seemed to be the causing factor for this decrease. Furthermore, the oxidative stability of model systems enriched with photoautotrophic microalgae was significantly higher than of those enriched with heterotrophic microalgae. It can therefore be concluded that photoautotrophic microalgae low in initial free fatty acid content are a promising source of n-3 LC PUFA in thermally processed acidic food systems.

AB With the increasing demand for direct human and animal consumption seaweed farming is rapidly expanding worldwide. Macroalgae have colonized aquatic environments in which they are submitted to frequent changes in biotic and abiotic factors that can trigger oxidative stress (OS). Considering that isoprostanoid derivatives may constitute the most relevant OS biomarkers, we were interested to establish their profile in two red and four brown macroalgae. Seven phytoprostanes, three phytofuranes, and four isoprostanes were quantified through a new micro-LC-MS/MS method. The isoprostanoid contents vary greatly among all the samples, the ent-16(RS)-9-epi-ST-Delta(14)-10-PhytoF and the sum of 5-F-2t-IsoP and 5-epi-5F(2t)-IsoP being the major compounds for most of the macroalgae studied. We further quantified these isoprostanoids in macroalgae submitted to heavy metal (copper) exposure. In most of the cases, their concentrations increased after 24 h of copper stress corroborating the original hypothesis. One exception is the decrease of ent-9-L1 PhytoP content in L. digitata.

AB The possibility of 2,4,6-trichloroanisole (TCA) migration through synthetic stoppers and into wine from highly contaminated air was shown by several authors. However, those experiments were usually conducted without bottle capsules, which are a common part of wine packaging. In the current study, we demonstrated that the presence of capsules (without open holes) above synthetic stoppers can reduce wine contamination by airborne d(5)-TCA by about 10 times or more. Generally, metallic capsules revealed better barrier properties than polyvinyl chloride counterparts. Application of EVOH film on the external surface of the polyvinyl chloride capsules usually resulted in a lower level of wine contamination. Additionally it was demonstrated, that relatively short exposure (3 months) of the bottles to highly contaminated air could cause a considerable absorption of d(5)-TCA by synthetic stoppers, which can subsequently lead to wine contamination after 12 months.

AB Three types of material meats were prepared from a so-called normal muscle part of white croaker (Pennahia argentata) containing 0, 4.2 and 8.4% of an abdominal muscle part. Thermally induced gels were then prepared from these materials by pre-heating at 65 degrees C for 30 or 60 min and subsequent heating at 85 degrees C for 20 min. The breaking strength and breaking strain rate of thermally induced gels decreased with increasing contamination levels of the abdominal muscle part, in which degradation of myosin heavy chains was observed. The proteolytic activity in the abdominal muscle part homogenate was highest at 62.5 degrees C. These results suggest that the abdominal muscle part contains proteases that induce the modori phenomenon. Technical experts assume that a contaminated abdominal muscle part leads to quality deterioration in surimi production industries. Our findings will aid the production of high-quality surimi-based products.

AB In the framework of celiac disease, this research aims at evaluating the reactivity of 195 wheat accessions and 240 spelt accessions to A1 and G12 monoclonal antibodies. A great variability in reactivity was found among the accessions of both subspecies. On average, spelt showed very slightly higher reactivity than wheat but accessions with low reactivity were encountered in both subspecies. In both wheat and spelt, there was no significant difference in the level of reactivity between varieties and landraces. Similarly, there was no significant difference in reactivity between old, mid and new varieties of wheat. In contrast, new spelt varieties showed lower levels of reactivity than old and mid ones. No relationship could be established between level of reactivity, protein content and the Zeleny index. This research did not establish a link between the breeding strategies for baking quality improvement and A1-G12 antibodies reactivity.

AB Interaction of metal, especially iron ions with flavanols is considered as an important feature of these compounds and is believed to contribute to their both antioxidant and prooxidant properties. The aim of this study was to examine how Fe2+ binding to form a 4:1 (flavanol:Fe2+) mixtures affects the antioxidant properties of flavanols. ABTS* scavenging, protection against fluorescence bleaching induced by AAPH and hypochlorite, protection against lipid peroxidation and protection against hypochlorite-induced hemolysis demonstrated that flavonol-Fe2+ mixtures retain antioxidant properties, although, in most cases, they are lower with respect to the flavanols alone. No superoxide dismutase-like or catalase-like activity of the mixtures was revealed.

AB The present work evaluated the effect of high-power ultrasonication on the structure and properties of guava juice. The microstructure, concentration of lycopene, in vitro accessibility of lycopene and physical properties (pulp sedimentation, turbidity and colour) were evaluated. The results of this study demonstrate that the ultrasonication disrupts the guava cells, releasing their content and altering the juice properties. Although this processing decreases the total amount of lycopene in guava juice, the release of lycopene from the cells increased its in vitro accessibility. Furthermore, the size reduction of the dispersed pulp particles improved the physical stability of the juice, avoiding pulp sedimentation without significant colour changes during storage. In conclusion, it is suggested that ultrasonication is an interesting alternative to improve the physical and nutritional properties of fruit juices.

AB Business Intelligence that applies data analytics to generate key information to support business decision making, has been an important area for more than two decades. In the last five years, the trend of "Big Data" has emerged and become a core element of Business Intelligence research. In this article, we review academic literature associated with "Big Data" and "Business Intelligence" to explore the development and research trends. We use bibliometric methods to analyze publications from 1990 to 2017 in journals indexed in Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) and Arts & Humanities Citation Index (AHCI). We map the time trend, disciplinary distribution, high-frequency keywords to show emerging topics. The findings indicate that Computer Science and management information systems are two core disciplines that drive research associated with Big Data and Business Intelligence. "Data mining", "social media" and "information system" are high frequency keywords, but "cloud computing", "data warehouse" and "knowledge management" are more emphasized after 2016.

AB This study evaluates the performance of different data clustering approaches for searching the profitable consumer segments in the UK hospitality industry. The paper focuses on three aspects of datasets including the ordinal nature of data, high dimensionality and outliers. Data collected from 513 sample points are analysed in this paper using four clustering approaches: Hierarchical clustering, K-Medoids, fuzzy clustering, and Self-Organising Maps (SOM). The findings suggest that Fuzzy and SOM based clustering techniques are comparatively more efficient than traditional approaches in revealing the hidden structure in the data set. The segments derived from SOM has more capability to provide interesting insights for data-driven decision making in practice. This study makes a significant contribution to literature by comparing different clustering approaches and addressing misconceptions of using these for market segmentation to support data-driven decision making in business practices.

ID ACCURACY
AB Ensuring scalability of recommender systems without sacrificing the quality of the recommendations produced, presents significant challenges, especially in the large-scale, real-world setting of mobile ad targeting. In this paper, we propose MobRec, a novel two-stage user similarity based approach to recommendation which combines information provided by slowly-changing features of the mobile context and implicit user feedback indicative of user preferences. MobRec uses the contextual features to cluster, during an off-line stage, users that share similar patterns of mobile behavior. In the online stage, MobRec focuses on the cluster consisting of users that are most similar to the target user in terms of their contextual features as well as implicit feedback. MobRec also employs a novel strategy for robust estimation of user preferences from noisy clicks. Results of experiments using a large-scale real-world mobile advertising dataset demonstrate that MobRec outperforms the state-of-the-art neighborhood-based as well as latent factor-based recommender systems, in terms of both scalability and the quality of the recommendations.

AB In recent years, the growing availability of huge amounts of information, generated in every sector at high speed and in a wide variety of forms and formats, is unprecedented. The ability to harness big data is an opportunity to obtain more accurate analyses and to improve decision-making in industry, government and many other organizations. However, handling big data may be challenging and proper data integration is a key dimension in achieving high information quality. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to data integration that calibrates online generated big data with interview based customer survey data. A common issue of customer surveys is that responses are often overly positive, making it difficult to identify areas of weaknesses in organizations. On the other hand, online reviews are often overly negative, hampering an accurate evaluation of areas of excellence. The proposed methodology calibrates the levels of unbalanced responses in different data sources via resampling and performs data integration using Bayesian Networks to propagate the new re-balanced information. In this paper we show, with a case study example, how the novel data integration approach allows businesses and organizations to get a bias corrected appraisal of the level of satisfaction of their customers. The application is based on the integration of online data of review blogs and customer satisfaction surveys from the San Francisco airport. We illustrate how this integration enhances the information quality of the data analytic work in four of InfoQ dimensions, namely, Data Structure, Data Integration, Temporal Relevance and Chronology of Data and Goal.

AB Social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, have become important venues for business and individuals. Social interactions between actors result in the formation of meso-scale subgroup structures, such as communities. Community detection is a classic task of social network analysis. Identification of another meso-scale structure, named core-periphery, arises recently. Much existing research discriminated communities from core-periphery structures, and performed the two tasks individually by completely different methodologies. The two meso-scale structures can both attribute to unequal influence and asymmetric interactions of actors in social networks. This research tries to unify communities and core-periphery structures by regarding the two subgroup structures as the same thing, by which community structure characterizes the boundary of a subgroup and core-periphery structure characterizes its internal structure. Experiments are conducted on one-month twitter data, and results can provide empirical evidences that social communities always have core-periphery structures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Online social lending has facilitated the ability of borrowers to reach lenders for financing support. With the increasing number of social lending projects, it is becoming very difficult for lenders to find appropriate projects to invest in, and for borrowers to get the funds they need. Project recommendation techniques provide a promising way to solve this problem to some degree, by recommending borrowers' projects to lenders who are able to invest. Unfortunately, current loan project recommendations only explore some structured information to match borrowers and lenders, so they cannot achieve a satisfactory way to solve the problem very well. In this study, we innovatively mine a huge amount of unstructured data, the text data of borrowers' and lenders' motivations, to provide loan project recommendations that solve the problem of mismatches between borrowers and lenders. We present a motivation-based recommendation approach that uses text mining and classifier techniques to identify borrowers' and lenders' motivations. Using a dataset from the well-known social lending platform Kiva, our experiment results show that, compared with prior works, the proposed approach improves project recommendations in inactive lender groups and unpopular loan groups, which shows the superiority of the proposed approach in addressing data sparsity and cold start problems in loan project recommendations. This study thus initiates an attempt to solve the information overload problem and improve matching between borrowers and lenders through mining big unstructured text data found in a large number of P2P platforms.

AB Being able to understand the implicit power structures and dynamics among members plays a crucial role for the management of the organization. This paper introduces a novel and comprehensive approach to analyzing organizational discourse data. The proposed approach provides a holistic view of the power structure implied by the communications. The paper contributes to the domain of text mining by integrating various text-mining techniques to demonstrating different aspects of a power structure within an organization. It also contributes to the domain of supply chain management by using the conventional communication discourse method as the guideline for the development of the tool. We applied the proposed approach to a seven-year collection of meeting minutes from a co-op and our findings were largely confirmed by members of the organization. We provide a roadmap of using the multi-aspect approach to analyzing organizational discourse data in supply networks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mycotoxins, present in a wide range of food and feed commodities, are toxic secondary metabolites produced by a number of different fungi. Certain mycotoxins do not readily degrade at high temperatures, therefore are resistant to food processing, and consequently are present in the human and animal food supply.
   Optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) was applied for the detection of aflatoxin B1, in a competitive immunoassay format, to compare the analytical sensitivity achieved with an immunosensor design allowing signal enhancement by increasing the sensor surface through immobilization of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of different size and origin (obtained by chemical or biotechnological synthesis). The effects of AuNPs median size, the methods of sensitization and the biochemical parameters on immunosensor performace were examined. After optimization of the sensitized sensor surface, an immunosensing method was developed for the analysis of aflatoxin in paprika matrix and the results were compared with HPLC reference measurements.

AB The oral bioaccessibility of several essential and toxic elements was investigated in raw and cooked commercially available seafood species from European markets. Bioaccessibility varied between seafood species and elements. Methylmercury bioaccessibility varied between 10 (octopus) and 60% (monkfish). Arsenic (> 64%) was the toxic element showing the highest bioaccessibility. Concerning essential elements bioaccessibility in raw seafood, selenium (73%) and iodine (71%) revealed the highest percentages. The bioaccessibility of elements in steamed products increased or decreased according to species. For example, methylmercury bioaccessibility decreased significantly after steaming in all species, while zinc bioaccessibility increased in fish (tuna and plaice) but decreased in molluscs (mussel and octopus).
   Together with human exposure assessment and risk characterization, this study could contribute to the establishment of new maximum permissible concentrations for toxic elements in seafood by the European food safety authorities, as well as recommended intakes for essential elements.

AB Coffee silverskin (a coffee roasting by-product) contains high amounts of dietary fibre (49% insoluble and 7% soluble) and protein (19%). Potassium (similar to 5 g/100 g), magnesium (2 g/100 g) and calcium (0.6 g/100 g) are the major macrominerals. The vitamin E profile of silverskin comprises alpha-tocopherol, beta-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol, delta-tocopherol, beta-tocotrienol, gamma-tocotrienol, and delta-tocotrienol. The fatty acid profile is mainly saturated (C16:0 and C22:0), but the total amount of fat is low (2.4%). Caffeine (1.25 g/100 g), chlorogenic acid (246 mg/100 g), and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5.68 mg/100 g) are also present in silverskin. Total phenolics and flavonoids are partially responsible for the in vitro antioxidant activity. Silverskin extracts protected erythrocytes from oxidative AAPH-and H2O2-induced hemolysis, but at high concentrations a pro-oxidant effect on erythrocyte morphology was observed.

AB The aim of this work was to develop computational intelligence models based on neural networks (NN), fuzzy models (FM), and support vector machines (SVM) to predict physicochemical composition of bee pollen mixture given their botanical origin. To obtain the predominant plant genus of pollen (was the output variable), based on physicochemical composition (were the input variables of the predictive model), prediction models were learned from data. For the inverse case study, input/output variables were swapped.
   The probabilistic NN prediction model obtained 98.4% of correct classification of the predominant plant genus of pollen. To obtain the secondary and tertiary plant genus of pollen, the results present a lower accuracy.
   To predict the physicochemical characteristic of a mixture of bee pollen, given their botanical origin, fuzzy models proven the best results with small prediction errors, and variability lower than 10%. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, effects of low intensity electrical current (EC) and ultrasound (US) treatments on the reduction of some important pesticides (captan, thiamethoxam and metalaxyl) residues in tomato samples were investigated. Three different currents (200, 800 and 1400 mA) of EC were applied at various time intervals (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 min). Two kinds of US treatments including ultrasonic bath (UB) at 40 kHz and ultrasonic probe (UP) at 24 kHz were tested for the determination of US effectiveness. In addition, synergistic effects of US on EC treatments were evaluated.
   The most effective conditions for reduction of captan, thiamethoxam and metalaxyl residues were 1400 mA + 40 kHz, 800 mA + 24 kHz and 1400 mA + 24 kHz, respectively. The residues of captan, thiamethoxam and metalaxyl were reduced in the order of 94.24%, 69.80% and 95.06% by using these combinations. EC and US strategies can be considered as effective treatments in industrial scale in order to remove the pesticide residues from vegetables.

AB The effect of hydrogenation of phospholipids on the characteristics of freeze-dried liposomes was investigated using hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) as membrane protectant. The ethanol-injection method was applied to prepare liposomes using hydrogenated (Phospholopion-90H and 80H) and non-hydrogenated phospholipids (Lipoid-S100) in combination with cholesterol. Various liposomal formulations were tested: conventional liposomes (CL) and HP-beta-CD-loaded liposomes (CDL). Liposome suspensions were concentrated by ultracentrifugation; the pellets were reconstituted in water or CD solution and the dispersions were characterized for their size, polydispersity index and zeta potential. Results demonstrated that HP-beta-CD protected only the hydrogenated batches (CL and CDL) during freeze-drying. Moreover, the presence of HP-beta-CD in the aqueous phase of CDL protected them during freeze-drying. Freeze-dried CL and CDL made of phospholipon-90H loading anethole were demonstrated to be physically stable upon reconstitution in HP-beta-CD solutions, and are able to retain anethole after 6 months of storage at 4 degrees C thereby making them valuable for food applications.

AB The aim of this research was to valorize onion skins, an under-utilized agricultural by-product, into pectic oligosaccharides (POS), compounds with potential health benefits. To achieve high hydrolysis performance with the multi-activity enzyme Viscozyme L, an innovative approach was investigated based on a cross-flow continuous membrane enzyme bioreactor (EMR). The influence of the various process conditions (residence time, enzyme concentration, substrate concentration) was investigated on productivity and yield. The composition of the POS mixtures in terms of mono-and oligosaccharides was assessed at the molecular level. At optimized conditions, a stable POS production with 22.0 g/L/h volumetric productivity and 4.5 g/g POS/monosaccharides was achieved. Compared to previous results obtained in batch for the enzyme Viscozyme L, EMR provided a 3-5x higher volumetric productivity for the smallest POS. Moreover, it gave competitive results even when compared to batch production with a pure endo-galacturonase enzyme, demonstrating its feasibility for efficient POS production.

AB Five Pinto bean peptides with a-amylase and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activities were successfully identified using the integrated bioinformatics approach. By using PEAKS studio, 511 peptide sequences were first shortlisted based on their de novo sequence property and average local confidence (ALC) yield of >= 60%. Subsequently, only five peptides were found to have high potential (score >= 0.80) for contributing bioactivy. The important sites which were potentially bound by the peptides: (a) Trp58, Trp59, Tyr 62, Asp96, Arg195, Asp197, Glu233, His299, Asp300 and His305 for alpha-amylase; (b) His353, Ala354, His383, Glu384, His387, Glu411, Lys511, His513, Tyr520 and Tyr523 for ACE had corresponded to the catalytic and substrate binding sites of the two enzymes. A validation assay was then conducted and IC50 values were determined. The range of the values for alpha-amylase inhibitory activity was 10.03-23.33 mM, whereas the values for ACE inhibitory activity were of 1.52-31.88 mu M. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results showed that the effect of the fat type on aroma release was smaller than that of fat level. Ice creams with low fat level released more hydrophobic aroma compounds than ice creams with high fat level. At low fat level more aroma compounds were released from ice creams with lower protein content. At high fat level a small increase of aroma release was observed by the addition of saliva, which was explained by a salting out effect, due to the presence of proteins and salts in the saliva. These findings confirmed that the interactions between salivary proteins and aroma compounds occurring in aqueous solutions are not observed in emulsions.

AB The stability of anthocyanins in bokbunja (Rubus occidentalis L.) extract was investigated using an in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion. Ethanolic extract from bokbunja was digested with pepsin/HCl for 2 h at 37 degrees C, followed by pancreatin/bile salts for 2 h at 37 degrees C. Four anthocyanins including cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-sambubioside, cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside and cyanidin-rutinoside were identified in the bokbunja extract. The total anthocyanin content of bokbunja was 3.76 mg cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalents/g fresh weight (FW). Gastric digestion had no significant effect on anthocyanins. However, intestinal digestion substantially decreased anthocyanins up to 1.70 mg/g FW, corresponding to 45% of that in the bokbunja extract. This indicates that about half of anthocyanins can reach an intestinal tract. In addition, a new compound comprised of cyanidin-3-glucosdie, catechin and acetaldehyde in a separated study was observed after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. This shows that anthocyanins could be transformed into other compounds with different biochemical properties.

AB Many consumers use the term "gu-soo" to describe the flavor characteristics of traditional Doenjang (fermented soybean paste). The objective of this study was twofold: 1) to define the sensory modality associated with the perception of gu-soo in Doenjang, and 2) to correlate instrumental data on when the term gu-soo is used for describing sensory characteristics of Doenjang. To achieve these objectives, using five Doenjang samples, we conducted consumer sensory analysis with limited sensory modalities as well as instrumental flavor and color analyses. Three volatile compounds were identified as showing high correlation to consumer perception of gu-soo for Doenjang: 1-hexanol, benzene ethanol, benzene, and 2-methyl furan. The results from the current study suggest that consumer perception of gu-soo in Doenjang is not solely an olfactory-related perception, suggesting that visual stimuli, including a darker paste color and an apparent high number of beans in the paste, are highly related to the consumer perception of gu-soo in Doenjang, followed by olfactory related terms, and taste-related stimuli.

AB The objective of the current study was to correlate the sensory and instrumental flavor analysis results of commercial orange juice (OJ) products prepared by different processing methods. Descriptive analysis was conducted using a highly trained panel (n=6) to evaluate four OJs in triplicate. Volatile compounds associated with the four OJs were quantitatively and qualitatively identified using a Dynamic Headspace Sampling, followed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry analysis. The sensory characteristics of the four commercially available OJs were significantly different (p<.05). OJs requiring refrigeration storage (OJ3 and OJ4) had high intensity of orange peel flavor, and shelf-stable OJs (OJ1 and OJ2) had high intensity of cooked orange flavor (p<.05). Similarly, differences in volatile flavor profiles of 4 OJs were documented. The shelf-stable OJs (OJ1 and OJ2) had desirable volatile flavor compounds, such as beta-pinene, dl-limonene, linalool, nonalool, and decanal, and OJs requiring refrigeration had high levels of alpha- and beta-terpineol.

AB The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) on Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) in the determination of the fatty acid content in meat and meat products. The Multivariate calibrations were developed and proposed for Saturated Fatty Acids (SFA), Monounsatured Fatty Acids (MUFA), Polyunsatured Fatty Acids (PUFA) and Palmitic Acid.
   SFA and MUFA models, developed using the first derivative and the selected region 3022.33-650.15 cm(-1), gave the best performance, with a coefficient of calibration r(2) 0.9834 and 0.9775, respectively, and the relative Root Mean Square Error of Calibration (RMSEC) 0.594 and 0.699. The best model for PUFA was obtained for region 4000.12-650.15 using the first derivative (r(2) 0.9817, RMSEC 0.724).
   Palmitic acid, chosen as the case study of single fatty acids, showed a best linear regression for the first derivative approach in region 4000.12-650.15. Results were less satisfactory in prediction in the proposed models.

AB This study proposes different markers associations for the discrimination of organically and conventionally grown carrots, as well as for the geographical origin differentiation. It was shown that one of the most powerful differentiation markers proved to be Mn content. Along with manganese concentrations, isotope ratios of nitrogen and a high number of Rare Earth-Elements (REEs) were able to differentiate the organically grown carrots samples in a percent of 83.3% (initial classification) and 81% (cross-validation), respectively. It was observed that some of the obtained discrimination markers were interlinked, for instance Mn content being positively correlated with some REEs (i.e. Sc, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Lu, Th). One of the best markers that could differentiate the carrot samples grown in Transylvania, Romania, from those either grown in other side of the country or foreign samples is represented by Mn content along with another REE, particularly terbium (Tb).

AB Nineteen hot pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) samples from five countries and twenty samples from Romanian producers were analyzed. Concentrations of flavonoids and capsaicin were simultaneously quantified for the first time with the method developed and validated in the present paper. delta C-13, delta H-2, and delta O-18 isotopic values were also measured. Maximum concentrations of studied compounds were detected in methanol extracts, after 12 h incubation of the samples assisted by ultrasound, at the 1: 8 ratio of sample to solvent. The extraction recovery ranged from 90.60% to 115.05%. Capsaicin and four flavonoids were quantified in studied samples at different concentration ranges: capsaicin (28.23-2322.35 mu g/g), vitexin (2.93-33.46 mu g/g), isoquercetin (3.19-155.58 mu g/g), kaempferol-3-glucoside (2.31-2462.25 mu g/g) and myricetin (1.55-78.79 mu g/g). The association between these analytical techniques and chemometric tools proved that kaempferol-3-glucoside is one of the strongest markers for country and maturity stage discrimination.

AB Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to predict the processing parameters of the casein-glucose/galactose Maillard reaction (MR) for determining the level of N-epsilon-(1-carboxymethyl)-L-lysine (CML), one of the typically harmful dietary advanced glycation end products (AGEs). The effect of industrial heating time and temperature of the MR on casein-glucose reactant (CGR) and casein-galactose reactant (CGaR) was evaluated. An increase in temperature and time was associated with an increased level of CML. A heating time of 114.8/117.9 min and a temperature of 145.1/148.8 degrees C maximised the formation of CML on CGR/CGaR and resulted in a CML production of 12.0/14.0 mu g/mL. Evaluation of foam stability, SDS-PAGE, and energy filtering-TEM indicated that the CGR and CGaR had different characteristics. Moreover, level of intracellular reactive oxygen species was accumulated with increasing CML contents. In summary, RSM provided a basis for understanding CGR/CGaR-reactivity and for predicting the formation of CML in heat-treated milk products.

AB Cocoa beans are rich in bioactive phytochemicals such as alkaloids, anthocyanins, as well as monomeric and oligomeric flavan-3-ols. A high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) method was developed for a fast analysis of a fingerprint of bioactive compounds present in cocoa beans depending on genotype and origin.
   Evaluation was performed using HPTLC followed by densitometry. The best separation for a fingerprint consisting of eight phenolic compounds as markers was achieved on silica gel 60 F-254 HPTLC plates with a solvent mixture of ethyl formate, formic acid, water, toluene 30/4/3/1.5 (v/v/v/v). Staining with Fast Blue Salt B enabled visualization and quantitative evaluation. Compounds of interest were confirmed by eluting zones using a TLC-MS interface. LODs were <= 100 ng/zone for all compounds. The fingerprints obtained are useful for quality control of cocoa beans allowing their differentiation according to cocoa or chocolate sorts, varieties, and origins.

AB Multielement isotope ratio was assessed in fat and defatted (protein) fillet of 130 rainbow trout, reared with feed incorporating a high or low fish content in 20 Italian farms, focusing on two northern Italian regions (Friuli Venezia Giulia and Trentino). The aim was to investigate the ability of isotopic analysis to trace the geographical origin of trout, also according to the type of feed. The carbon, nitrogen and sulphur isotope ratios of feed and fillet were highly positively correlated both within each matrix (feed or fillet) and between the two matrices and negatively correlated with the delta H-2 and delta O-18 of feed and the delta H-2(fat). The delta H-2(protein) and delta O-18(protein) were positively interrelated with the delta O-18 of tank water. By applying the tested Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis multiclass model (85 fillets) to the validation dataset (45 fillets), 91% accuracy was obtained for the two Italian regions.

AB The nutritional value and chemical composition of various artichoke genotypes cultivated in Greece were evaluated. Significant differences were detected in water content, as well as in fat, ash, protein and carbohydrate content. Proteins and carbohydrates were detected in high amounts in all the genotypes. Antioxidant activity was also varied between the studied samples. Palmitic and linoleic acids were the most abundant fatty acids in artichoke heads, while stearic, oleic, alpha-linolenic, arachidic, behenic and lignoceric acids were detected in lesser amounts. 3,5-O-Dicaffeoylquinic acid and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid were the main phenolic compounds. In conclusion, heads of artichoke genotypes cultivated in Greece showed a high nutritional value and antioxidant activity which signifies the importance of this vegetable for the Mediterranean diet, while the diversity in chemical composition between the studied samples should be further exploited for the selection of elite cultivars with specific end-uses of the final product.

AB Gluten-free bakery products usually exhibit weak aroma. Their main constituents are flours and starches, which contain aroma precursors but can also contribute additional volatiles in low concentrations. Static headspace (SHS), solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and solvent-assisted flavour evaporation (SAFE) coupled to GC/QTOF were compared for their efficacy in the analysis of volatiles in corn starch. SPMEGC/QTOF was selected as the most suitable methodology based on the number of detected compounds, LODs, repeatability as well as simplicity. It was successfully applied for the quantification of volatiles in corn starch and qualitative comparison of different gluten-free flours. Hexanal, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 1-octen-3-ol, acetic acid, furfural, benzaldehyde, (E)-2-nonenal, phenylethyl alcohol and short-medium chain acids were found in all the flours and corn starch. Quinoa flour and corn starch showed the highest contents of pyrazines, terpenes and esters, while teff, buckwheat and rice flours presented the highest contents of 3/2-methyl-1-butanol, acetoin and organic acids.

ID CANNED TOMATO PASTE; VALIDATION
AB The aim of this work is the evaluation of quality indicators for the estimation of the shelf life of opened cans using the migration of specific metals as variables. For this reason the determination of targeted analytes such as: Cd, Pb, As, Cu, Cr, Ni, Fe, Mn and Sn in different canned samples (cardoon, tuna, green and red beans, corn, and fungi) by Electrothermal Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (Perkin Elmer, SIMAA 6000) was developed and validated. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 22. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were performed in order to examine the correlation between the content of metals and metalloids and the storage time of opened cans. The results showed that there is a strong correlation between metal concentration and storage time, especially for Fe and Sn. The storage time ranged from hours to days and the vast number of collected data sets, led to reliable conclusions about the evaluation of a new shelf life indicator. Principal component analysis indicated the appropriate storage time for opened cans, where no significant migration was observed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Yellow lupin polysaccharides (YLP-1, YLP-2 and YLP-3) were isolated from the whole seeds of Lupinus luteus L. Their antioxidant activities were evaluated by ABTS(+.) and hydroxyl radical scavenging, and Fe2+ chelating assays. Immunostimulatory activities were measured by their ability to activate macrophages to produce TNF-alpha and NO. Four strains of probiotic bacteria were used to measure their prebiotic activities. YLP-2 with largest galactose content displayed the best activity amongst the three isolated polysaccharides. NMR and FT-IR spectroscopic methods have revealed that YLPs contain galactans and galactomannans which are linked with beta-(1,4) glycosidic bond in the main chain. The side chain Galp unit of galactomannan is connected to the main chain Manp by alpha-(1,6) linkage. The results presented in this paper strongly suggest that YLPs display significant antioxidant, immunostimulatory and prebiotic activities and hence hold great potential as nutraceutical and functional agents.

AB This study describes the kinetics of furan and furfural generation in a cake model, for the first time. These process-induced compounds impact safety and sensory aspects of baked products. Understanding their generation with regards to process dynamics will serve food quality design. However, the complexity of real products makes this task challenging. This work provides a novel approach to understand and model chemical reactivity by implementing an inert cake model (starch, water and cellulose), specifically designed for mimicking a sponge cake structure. The addition of reaction precursors (glucose and leucine) to follow Maillard and caramelization reactions, resulted in browning and generated considerable levels of furanic compounds (up to 17.61 ng/g for furan and 38.99 mu g/g for furfural, dry basis). Multiresponse data modeling resulted in a kinetic model which adequately describes experimental concentrations and makes it possible to estimate the degradation of precursors and the behavior of two hypothetic intermediates.

AB New Zealand manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) and kanuka (Kunzea ericoides) honeys contain a unique array of chemical markers useful for chemical fingerprinting. We investigated the presence of 13 potential marker compounds in nectars of the major honey crop species. We confirmed that leptosperin, lepteridine, 2'-methoxyacetophenone, and 2-methoxybenzoic acid are exclusive to manuka nectar whereas lumichrome is unique to kanuka nectar. 3-Phenyllactic acid and 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid are present in manuka and kanuka nectars. Leptosperin, lepteridine, 3-phenyllactic acid, and 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid are chemically stable over prolonged storage, but not 2-methoxybenzoic acid and 2'-methoxyacetophenone. Accordingly, leptosperin and lepteridine are definitive chemical markers for authentication of manuka honey. An optimal concentration cut-off was established for the floral source-specific markers: leptosperin (94 mg/kg), lepteridine (2.1 mg/kg), 2'-methoxyacetophenone (2.0 mg/kg) for manuka honey, and lumichrome (4.5 mg/kg) for kanuka honey. The use of leptosperin and lepteridine as fluorescence markers for manuka honey authentication is reinforced. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pea (Pisum sativum L.) plants were sown in a field and foliar sprayed at blooming stage with solutions of different forms of iodine (I) -I-and IO3- and selenium (Se) - SeO32- and SeO42-. The possibility of enrichment of pea seeds to nutritionally important levels of both elements and their distribution through the plant parts were studied. To evaluate stress caused by application of I and Se, some morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics were determined. The results showed elevated concentrations of both elements in all parts of pea plants. In seeds, I content was more than 6-fold higher, while Se content was up to 12-fold higher than in control plants. Although the plants were in good condition, some differences in pod characteristics and electron transport system activity were observed. Glutathione content was not affected by any treatment and only the I- + SeO42- combination decreased the amount of anthocyanins in plants.

AB Large amounts of peptides are naturally generated in foods through the proteolysis phenomena taking place during processing. Such proteolysis is carried out either by endogenous enzymes in ripened foods or by the combined action of endogenous and microbial enzymes when fermented. Food proteins can also be isolated and hydrolysed by peptidases to produce hydrolysates. endo-peptidases act first followed by the successive action of exo-peptidases (mainly, tri-and di-peptidylpeptidases, aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases). The generated peptides may be further hydrolysed through the gastrointestinal digestion resulting in a pool of peptides with different sequences and lengths, some of them with relevant bioactivity. However, these peptides should be absorbed intact through the intestinal barrier and reach the blood stream to exert their physiological action. This manuscript is reporting the enzymatic routes and strategies followed for the generation of bioactive peptides. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Guarana (Paullinia cupana) is a typical product from Amazon biota that exerts antioxidant capacity due to the presence of phenolic compounds, such as catechin, epicatechin and proanthocyanidins. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential inhibitory activity of guarana extracts, after digestion in vitro, on carbohydrates-metabolism enzymes and to assess the bioacessibility of guarana polyphenols. The guarana samples before and after enzymatic digestion, were compared for total phenolic content and phenolic profile. Furthermore, we investigated the uptake of polyphenols from guarana, using Caco-2 cells, and the effect of digested guarana on carbohydrate metabolism enzymes. The amount of total phenolic compounds extracted from guarana decreased after digestion in vitro, and native phenolics were not identified after cell permeation. On the other hand, polyphenols from guarana were able to inhibit alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase activities. In conclusion, guarana can be considered as a dietary source with anti-hyperglycemic potential.

AB C. sativa threshing residues were biorefined by consecutive supercritical carbon dioxide (SFE-CO2) pressurised liquid (PLE) and enzyme-assisted extractions (EAE). SFE-CO2 at optimised parameters yielded 8.3 g/100 g of lipophilic fraction containing 0.2 and 2.2 g of cannabidiol and cannabidiolic acid per 100 g of threshing residues, respectively. The recovery of cannabinoids from plant material was >93%. PLE gave 4.3 and 18.9 g/100 g of flavonoid-containing polar extracts, while EAE added 20.2% (w/w) of water-soluble constituents and increased the release of mono-and disaccharides by up to 94%. Antioxidant capacity of non-polar and polar fractions was in the range of 1.3-23.5 mg gallic acid equivalents/g DW and 0.6-205.2 mg Trolox equivalents/g DW, with the highest activities of PLE-EtOH/H2O extract. The combined SFE-CO2, PLE and EAE reduced antioxidant capacity of starting plant material by 90-99%, showing that suggested multistep fractionation procedure is efficient in the recovery of a major part of the antioxidatively active constituents from hemp threshing residues.

AB An innovative core-shell nanocarrier, combining the magnetism of surface active maghemite nanoparticles (SAMNs, the core) and tannic acid (TA, the shell) was self-assembled by simple incubation in water. Due to the drastic reorganization of SAMN surface, the prepared magnetic nanocarrier (SAMN@TA) resulted as one of the most robust nanomaterial bearing TA to date. Nevertheless, the ferric tannates network, constituting the SAMN@TA shell, and the free tannic acid display comparable chemical behavior. The antimicrobial properties of SAMN@TA were tested on Listeria monocytogenes in comparison with free TA, showing similar bacteriostatic effects at relatively low concentrations. Besides the preservation of the TA inhibitory activity toward L. monocytogenes, the possibility of being magnetically removed leaving no residues into the matrix makes this nanocarrier an innovative processing aid for surface treatments. Thus, SAMN@TA can be used as an effective, low-cost and environmentally friendly antimicrobial nanomaterial for the food industry applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The expression levels of many genes and the related proteins change and regulate physiological and metabolic processes that help the plant survive harsh environmental conditions under cold stress. Damage due to cold and freezing conditions often causes dynamic loss of loquat fruits in cultivated parts of northern China. To illustrate the mechanism of cold tolerance in the loquat, we combined the transcriptomic analysis with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data from loquat leaves under 4 degrees C treatment. The results showed 122,081 genes and 1210 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), while only 4582 proteins and 300 differential proteins (DEPs) were identified. Functional annotation and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis indicated that metabolic pathways and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites were the two most common pathways in transcriptional and translational processes in this study. Comparison analysis of the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles, only 27 of 3620 genes were found to be shared both in DEGs and DEPs. Further validation with Real-Time Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the genes expression of NADP-dependent D-sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, anthocyanin synthase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase were consistent with the pattern of transcriptome profile, which suggested that these three genes might play vital roles in cold tolerance in loquat.

AB Breast cancer is a complex disease and its effective treatment needs affordable diagnosis and subtyping signatures. While the use of machine learning approach in clinical computation biology is still in its infancy, the prevalent approach in identifying molecular biomarkers remains to be screening of all biomarkers by differential expression analysis. Many of these attempts used miRNAs expression data in breast cancer and amounted to the multitude of differentially expressed miRNAs in this cancer; hence, the minimal set of miRNA biomarkers to classify breast cancer is yet to be identified.
   Availability of diverse and vast amount of cancer datasets like The Cancer Genome Atlas facilitated the molecular profiling of patients' tumors and introduced new challenges like clinical grade interpretations from big data. In this study, miRNA expression dataset of breast cancer patients from TCGA database was used to develop prediction models from which miRNA biomarkers were identified for diagnosis and molecular subtyping of this cancer. I took the advantage of interpretability of tree-based classification models to extract their rules and identify minimal set of biomarkers in this cancer.
   Empirical negative control miRNAs in breast cancer obtained and used to normalize the dataset. Tree -based machine learning models trained in my analysis used hsa-miR-139 with hsa-miR-183 to classify breast tumors from normal samples, and hsa-miR4728 with hsa-miR190b to further classify these tumors into three major subtypes of breast cancer. In addition to the proposed biomarkers, the most important miRNAs in breast cancer classification were also presented.

AB Scylla paramamosain (Crustacea) is a commercially important euryhaline species distributed along the coast of southern China and other Indo-Pacific countries. However, a sudden variation in salinity will cause injury or even death to S. paramamosain. In this paper, we simulated a sudden decrease in salinity due to heavy precipitation in crab ponds. Comparison of gill microstructures of individuals in the control group and decreased salinity group showed gills became shorter and thicker, while the top of the filaments became swollen and then returned to normal after 120 h. A total of 3962 proteins were identified by proteomic sequencing of gills after 120 h under conditions of decreased salinity. 845 proteins were differentially expressed: 371 up-regulated and 474 down-regulated. Of the enriched KEGG pathways, 20 were up-regulated and 14 were down-regulation (P < 0.05). Among the significantly enriched up-regulated pathways, six were associated with amino acid metabolism and three were associated with Na+-K+-ATPase enzymatic activities. Pathways associated with redox metabolism and energy metabolism were identified. These results showed that in response to a decrease in salinity, S. paramamosain could adapt to the environment after 120 h. Molecular mechanism of this adaptation involved amino acid metabolism and Na+-K+-ATPase ion transport. Meanwhile, energy metabolism and redox metabolism were critical to the adaptation to a sudden decrease in salinity. This study, for the first time at the protein level, revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying salinity adaption of S. paramamosain and provides theoretical guidelines for the cultivation of S. paramamosain and other marine crustaceans.

AB Purpose: Osteoporosis is an important multifactorial disease which is largely influenced by Wnt signaling pathway. Considering regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms in Wnt signaling pathway may pave the road of understanding the genetic basis of predisposition to osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to determine the possible association between variants of SFRP1 and WNT5b, and osteoporosis incidence risk.
   Methods: The study population comprised 186 osteoporotic patients and 118 normal subjects from Amirkola Health and Ageing Project. rs1127379 (c.1406A > G) and rs3242 (c.3132C > T) variants in 3'UTR of SFRP1 gene, and rs3803164 (c.236C > T) in 3'UTR and rs735890 (c.622-536A > G) in intron 4 of WNT5b gene were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction -restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Regression analyses were used to calculate the association of genotype frequencies with bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) values of participants. Bioinformatics algorithms were used to detect the effect of each SNP on the secondary structure of mRNA, and predict putative 3'UTR microRNA target sites and splicing sites changes by related SNPs.
   Results: WNT5b rs735890 was associated with lumbar spine BMD, BMC, and femoral neck BMC (P = 0.035, P = 0.007, and P = 0.038, respectively). WNT5b rs3803164, and SFRP1 rs3242 were significantly associated with lumbar spine BMD (P = 0.028 and P = 0.030, respectively). SFRP1 rs1127379 was associated with lumbar spine BMD in the male gender. Haplotype analysis showed a significant association of SFRP1 c. [1406A; 3132C] haplotype with lumbar spine BMD, and BMC (P = 0.019 and P = 0.030, respectively), and SFRP1 c.[1406G; 3132C] haplotype with lumbar spine BMC (P = 0.045). In silico analyses revealed that the G allele of SFRP1 rs1127379, and WNT5b rs3803164 appear as more possible target sites for many miRNAs.
   Conclusions: This study is the first evidence of the association of WNT5b rs735890, and c. [1406A; 3132C] and c. 11406G; 3132C haplotypes of SFRP1 with BMD variation in osteoporosis, probably by altering microRNA target sites, in elderly persons.

AB Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is a congenital disease characterized by intestinal obstruction due to a defective intestinal neural system. Frequently, the disease is associated with an intestinal inflammation. The most common known underlying genetic alterations are in the RET gene but HSCR can also be caused by mutations in other genes that are responsible for the maturation and migration of intestinal neural cells. Recently, a study in an Asian population reported a significant association of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ILll (interleukin 11) gene with HSCR. We further explored the possible association of genetic alterations in the IL11 gene with HSCR and HSCR subtypes in an unrelated Caucasian population. We used a targeted sequencing approach to identify a total of 32 SNPs covering the coding region of the IL11 gene including the proximal part of the promoter and relevant SNPs described in the previous study. Genotype frequencies were compared using additive genetic models in 103 HSCR patients and 128 healthy controls. We failed to observe any significant association of SNPs with HSCR. However, there was a suggestive evidence for an association of the length of a dinucleotide repeat in the IL11 promoter region with HSCR with an over-representation of > 7 GT repeat subtypes (OR = 4.982 (1.448-17.040), p-value = 0.0111) in HSCR patients. A similar trend was further observed in a subgroup of patients with long-segment HSCR (L-HSCR). These findings need to be replicated in a well-powered study. Changes in ILl I expression may be a link to the intestinal inflammation frequently observed in patients with HSCR.

AB An increasing number of studies have revealed that long noncoding RNA (IncRNA) and circular RNA (circRNA) participate in the carcinogenesis and progression of tumors. However, most of these noncoding RNAs are of unknown function or without annotation. We carried out high-throughput sequencing to investigate the differential expression of lncRNAs and circRNAs and their biological functions in four coupled bladder cancer and adjacent noncancerous tissues. We identified significant differentially expressed transcripts and genes and acquired their annotations from the RefSeq and circBase databases, then confirmed the expression of randomly selected RNAs with quantitative real-time PCR. We also constructed a coding-noncoding co-expression (CNC) network and a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network to predict the functions of these RNAs using well studied protein-coding mRNA. Compared with adjacent tissues, 56 lncRNAs, 34 circRNAs and 467 protein coding mRNAs were upregulated while 32 lncRNAs, 84 circRNAs and 326 protein-coding mRNAs were down regulated in cancer tissues. Co-expression analysis showed that expression of LINC00885 were correlated with GATA3 expression. The ceRNA network indicated that lncRNA MIR194-2HG, AATBC and circRNA PGM5 could harbor bladder cancer-related microRNA (miRNA) recognition elements. We performed gene ontology (GO) and Kyoth Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis to ascertain the biological function of significantly dysregulated genes. Cell cycle and cell division pathways related to proliferation and apoptosis were obvious in enriched terms. Comprehensive analysis indicated that the dysregulated lncRNAs and circRNAs could participate in the genesis and progression of bladder cancer. Our approach may therefore be valuable for detecting novel transcripts, discovering new biomarkers for bladder cancer and expounding the pathogenic mechanisms of this disease.

AB Calmodulin (CaM) and calmodulin-like (CML) proteins are two kinds of calcium (Ca2+)-sensing proteins that are involved in Ca2+-signaling processes. B. rapa and B. oleracea are two of three diploid Brassica species that have undergone recent additional Brassiceae-lineage-specific whole-genome triplication events. To elucidate the expansion, evolution, expression pattern and interaction network of these Ca2+ sensors in B. rapa and B. oleracea, we conducted a comparative syntenic study on a genome-wide level using Arabidopsis thaliana. In total, 80 and 79 CaM/CML genes were identified in B. rapa and B. oleracea, respectively. The CaM/CML genes have expanded throughout the whole genomes of B. rapa and B. oleracea by whole-genome and tandem duplication events. The CaMs/CMLs of B. rapa and B. oleracea can be classified into nine subgroups based on their A. thaliana orthologs. Expression data from various tissues revealed that a large portion of CaM/CML genes exhibited patterns of differential and tissue-specific expression. The expression levels among duplicated paralogs in different subgenomes demonstrated the expression divergence of these genes in B. rapa and B. oleracea. The differential expressions of duplicated CaM and CML genes in B. rapa indicated that their functional differentiation occurred after polyploidization. The construction of interaction network and GO enrichment analysis of genes in this network revealed Br/BoCaMs/CMLs involving biological processes. This work will promote a better understanding of Ca2+ sensors and Ca2+-signaling pathways in B. rapa and B. oleracea.

AB CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) system is the convenient tool for targeted-gene activation, it has been developed and combined with a lighting-based system that can control transcription initiation spatially and temporally by utilizing photoreceptor derived from plant Arabidopsis thaliana. A blue light photoreceptor the Cryptochrome 2 (CRY2), and its binding partner CIB1 will dimerize by exposure to the blue light and it has been applied to human cells. However, the application of a combination of these two systems to zebrafish cell is still not explored. We performed zebrafish gene activation using p65 and VP64 activators in the zebrafish cells (ZF4). Our study demonstrated that we have successfully controlled the transcription level of ASCL1a, BCL6a, and HSP70 genes using blue light-activated CRISPR activation system. The result showed that using this system, mRNA level expression of ASCLia, BCL6a, and HSP70 genes increased after irradiated under blue light for several hours and significantly different to those which treated in the dark.

AB Clivia miniata var. variegata (Cmvv) typically possesses yellow- and green-striped leaves. The striped plant not only has a high ornamental value but also be suitable for photosynthesis and chloroplast development research. Our previous study had revealed that yellow stripes (YSs) of Cmvv leaves contain chlorophyll-less ineffective chloroplasts. However, mechanism of Cmvv variegation is yet to be investigated. In the study, transcriptomes of both the YSs and green stripes (GSs) from single Cmvv leaves were compared using high-throughput sequencing. A total of 688 differential expression genes (DEGs) were identified based on biological replications. The qRT-PCR results indicated that transcriptome profiles accurately reflected global transcriptome differences between YSs and GSs. Subcellular localization analysis suggested that 56 DEG proteins were targeted to chloroplasts, and might be involved in anterograde signaling and leaf patterning. Moreover, the DEGs were mostly enriched in photosynthesis and plant-pathogen interaction KEGG pathways. Meanwhile, there should be coordination interaction between the two pathways. Seven of the eight DEGs involved in photosynthesis KEGG pathway were chloroplast-encoded genes and distributed among different cistrons of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) large single copy regions (LSC) which are more prone to mutation. It was proposed that the YSs were caused by mutation(s) in cpDNA LSC. Thus, when the primary zygote of Cmvv was chimeric in LSC, leaf might be yellow- and green striped. The study would give new insights into plant variegation and offers candidate genes to guide future research attempting to breed variegated plants.

AB Objective: To screen for circular RNAs (circRNAs) that are associated with the activation of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) by monitoring changes in liver circRNA expression in a model of liver fibrosis.
   Methods: The classic mouse model of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis was established and validated by histopathological examination. JS1 cells were activated by TGF-beta 1 to model HSC activation in vitro. Differentially expressed circRNAs in the fibrotic liver tissues and JS1 cells were determined using circRNA microarray, and some of those circRNAs were verified by RT-qPCR. The target genes of the above circRNAs were then predicted by bioinformatics analysis and summarized into a "circRNA-miRNA-mRNA" network diagram. Constructed plasmid mmu_circ_34116 siRNA was transfected to JS1 cells by Lipo2000, then we detected the expression changes of alpha-SMA.
   Results: A total of 10,389 circRNAs were identified by microarray screening, and 69 differentially expressed circRNAs were detected in the fibrotic liver tissues with > 2-fold difference in expression level relative to normal liver tissues (P < 0.05); 14 circRNAs were up-regulated and 55 were down-regulated. Five differentially expressed cireRNAs in fibrotic liver and JS1 cells were verified by RT-qPCR, while all five showed similar trends with the microarray results in the liver, only 3 circRNAs in the JS1 activation model were consistent with the microarray results while one showed no significant change and one circRNA was not detected. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that the "mmu_circ_34116/miR-22-3P/BMP7" signal axis might be involved in the activation of HSC. Transfection experiment confirmed that the expression of alpha-SMA is significantly elevated as a result of inhibitory expression of mmu_circ_34116.
   Conclusion: The circRNAs expression profile of liver tissue had changed in fibrosis mouse model, and some of these circRNAs may be associated with HSC activation. For instance, mmu_circ_34116 would inhibit HSC activation.

AB Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is one of the two leading causes of mortality in Mexico. However, most studies have focused on Caucasians or Asians, and there are a small number of studies investigating Maya populations. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there is no information on isolated Maya communities with T2D frequencies of 20% that are primarily attributed to ethnicity. Consequently, this study focused on assessing which genetic risk variants could be involved in the high rates of T2D in 92 individuals with Maya ancestry; 47 were diagnosed with T2D, and 45 were classified as healthy individuals. A pilot genome-wide association study was performed using the Affymetrix Axiom Genome-wide LAT1 array. The population structure was determined with the ADMIXTURE software using 1289 Latin American selected polymorphisms, and 39 polymorphisms associated with T2D were included for replication. Association tests were performed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) using the allelic, genotype and Armitage trend tests. The results indicated that population structure analysis displayed no differences between T2D patients and healthy individuals; 24 loci located were identified for probable association with T2D (p > 1.288 x 10(-7) and p < 1.348 x 10(-4)); the polymorphism AGTR2 rs1914711 in chromosome X was identified by the allele test (OR = 6.824; p = 1.448 x 10(-9)) as a candidate gene for association with T2D; and ARL15 rs4311394 was associated as a T2D protector by genotype and the Armitage trend test (OR = 0.318; p = 0.001). In conclusion, this study proposes 24 candidate SNPs associated with T2D for replication studies and one for protective association with T2D.

AB Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis has been widely studied in an effort to understand its biological evolution. Transcriptomics has revealed possible candidates for virulence and pathogenicity factors of strain 1002 (biovar Ovis). Because C. pseudotuberculosis is classified into two biovars, Ovis and Equi, it was interesting to assess the transcriptional profile of biovar Equi strain 258, the causative agent of ulcerative lymphangitis. The genome of this strain was re-sequenced; the reassembly was completed using optical mapping technology, and the sequence was subsequently re-annotated. Two growth conditions that occur during the host infection process were simulated for the transcriptome: the osmotic and acid medium. Genes that may be associated with the microorganism's resilience under unfavorable conditions were identified through RNAseq, including genes present in pathogenicity islands. The RT-qPCR was performed to confirm the results in biological triplicate for each condition for some genes. The results extend our knowledge of the factors associated with the spread and persistence of C. pseudotuberculosis during the infection process and suggest possible avenues for studies related to the development of vaccines, diagnosis, and therapies that might help minimize damage to agribusinesses.

AB Polyamines such as spermine and spermidine perform multiple functions in cells and these include the regulation of transcription, protein and DNA syntheses, as well as the stabilization of DNA and RNA. At elevated concentrations, polyamines are toxic as catabolic processes via polyamine oxidases produce hydrogen peroxide and reactive aldehydes including acrolein that can damage proteins, DNA, and other cellular components. Efforts have been focused on the uptake of polyamines in order to identify targets that can transport polyamine analogs to destroy cancer cells. High throughput screens using the collection of yeast haploid mutants have revealed components of the plasma membrane including uptake transporters and effectors of the proton gradient that are involved in regulating polyamine toxicity. In this study, we used the collection of hypomorphic alleles of the essential genes downregulated by the Decreased Abundance by mRNA Perturbation (DAmP) strategy to search for strains with downregulated genes that display resistance to polyamines. We uncovered 115 DAmP strains that showed hyper-resistance to spermine. These DAmP strains were downregulated for genes encoding proteins that are involved in transcriptional regulation, RNA and DNA metabolisms. Our study identify new factors that can be modulated to sensitize cancer cells to polyamine analogs.

AB Skeletal muscle atrophy results from fasting, disuse and other systemic diseases. Muscle atrophy is associated with increased muscle protein degradation via the Ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). The Ubiquitin Specific Proteases (USPs), also known as deubiquitinating enzymes, regulates a wide variety of cellular processes in skeletal muscle. In our study, among the 41 members of the USP family identified in the skeletal muscle transcriptome of Chinese perch, 24 USPs were differentially expressed between the fast and slow muscle fibers. The expressional profile of 4 muscle-related USPs (USP10, USP14, USP19, USP45) was investigated in the fast and slow muscle in response to fasting at 4 and 7 days. The results showed that the expression of USP10, USP14 and USP19 was significantly increased in the fast muscle after fasting for 4 days and 7 days. But only the USP10 and USP14 had significantly increased at 7 days of fasting in the slow muscle. The expression of MAFbx and MuRF1 up-regulated and major myofibrillar genes down-regulated, indicating that all of these four USPs are involved in the protein degradation of the fast and slow muscle.

AB Charybdis japonica is an important cultured crab in China and it exhibits sex differences in their growth. Growth is an important economic trait that is controlled by many genes. In order to discover the growth-related regulatory mechanisms, whole-body transcriptomic sequencing and comparative analyses in different genders of C. japonica were conducted based on Illumina RNA-seq technology. In the present study, we obtained 62,879,204 and 60,226,334 clean reads in female and male libraries, respectively. 25,000,000 clean reads of every library were randomly selected and compared with Nt database to examine the possible contamination. Results showed that all clean reads were distributed among C. japonica or other species that were closely relative to this species, indicating no-pollution. De novo assembly was performed and a total of 32,543 and 44,174 unigenes were produced in female and male of C. japonica, respectively. Among all the unigenes, 12,591 and 14,455 unigenes of female and male crabs were annotated based on protein databases. Moreover, a total of 33,926 unigenes were found to contain ORFs and 52,839 SSRs were detected. The contrast between male and female C. japonica identifying 1939 unigenes were significantly differentially expressed. In addition, we specifically discussed some gene functions and pathways potentially associated with sex determination and growth. This is the first systematic report of whole transcriptome in C. japonica. The transcriptome information provides a basic resource for further studies on understanding the molecular basis of biological processes in C. japonica and other crustaceans.

AB Endometrial cancer (EC) is the fourth most common cancer in women and exhibits increasing incidence and mortality. Some reports showed that the 5-year survival rate of EC was closely associated with the diagnosed stage. It is urgent to screen for sensitive and specific targets to improve early detection and EC therapy. In our study, we found that zinc finger protein like 1 (ZFPL1) was highly expressed in EC tissues and the EC cell line RL95-2, as detected via RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. Immunocytochemistry results showed that ZFPL1 was localized in the Golgi complex dependent on the C-terminal transmembrane domain. The MTT and EdU stains were employed to examine the effect of ZFPL1 on cell proliferation. We found that the silencing of ZFPL1 blocked cell proliferation and the expression of p-Akt308 and p-Akt473 but improved the protein level of PTEN. The overexpression of ZFPL1 and ZFPL1 Delta TMD (deletion of the transmembrane domain) promoted cell proliferation and induced the expression of p-Akt308 and p-Akt473. However, the overexpression of ZFPL1 Delta RING (deletion of the RING domain) caused loss of the function of ZFPL1 in cell proliferation and the PI3K/Akt pathway. In summary, ZFPL1 induced RL95-2 cell proliferation and was involved in PI3K/Akt pathway, suggesting the oncogenic role of ZFPL1 during EC development. Additionally, the RING domain was essential for the function of ZFPL1. These findings provided a new biomarker for EC diagnosis and therapy.

AB The Litopenaeus vannamei (L. vannamei) is one of the most widely cultured shrimp species in the world, with low temperature being one of the most serious threats to its growth and survival. To examine the potential regulatory mechanism of cold adaptation, we conducted a microRNAs (miRNAs) analysis on the hepatopancreas of L. vannamei under normal temperature 28 degrees C (M28), cold acclimation 16 degrees C for 6 days (M16), and recovered under normal temperature (MR). In total 14,754,823, 14,945,246 and 15,880,093 raw reads representing 10,690,259, 8,587,144, and 11,512,941 unique sequences of 18-32 nt length were obtained from the M28, M16 and MR libraries, respectively. After comparing the miRNA sequences with the miRBase database, 68 known mature miRNAs and 47 novel miRNAs were identified. Expression analysis showed that 34 miRNAs were significantly differential expressed in response to cold adaptation. Compared to the M28 library, 21 miRNAs were upregulated and 13 miRNAs were downregulated significantly in the M16 library. After recovery to normal temperature, there are 16 miRNAs upregulated and 15 miRNAs downregulated significantly compared to M28 library.
   Then, five significantly differential expressed miRNAs under cold acclimation including three known miRNAs (mja-miR-6491, mja-miR-6494, and Bta-miR-2478) and two newly-identified miRNAs (novel 68 and novel_5) were selected for validation by RT-qPCR in the hepatopancreas and muscle tissues of cold treated shrimps. The expression trend of most the miRNAs from RT-qPCR were consistent with the next-generation sequencing data. Further, the Gene Ontology (GO) annotation showed that the metabolic process GO term was significantly enriched with target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs. Additionally, KEGG pathway analysis suggested that the fatty acid degradation and glycerolipid metabolism pathways etc. are significantly enriched with the target genes. These findings may contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing the responses to low temperature in L. vannamei.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a group of endogenous small non-coding RNAs, have been shown to play essential roles in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Although Paulownia tomentosa is an ecologically and economically important timber species due to its rapid growth, few efforts have focused on small RNAs (sRNAs) in the cambial tissues during winter and summer transition. In the present study, we identified 33 known miRNA families and 29 novel miRNAs which include 20 putative novel miRNAs* in P. tomentosa cambial tissues during winter and summer transition. Through differential expression analysis, we showed that 15 known miRNAs and 8 novel miRNAs were preferentially abundant in certain stage of cambial tissues. Based on the P. tomentosa mRNA transcriptome database, 1667 and 78 potential targets were predicted for 29 known and 20 novel miRNAs, respectively and the predicted targets are mostly transcription factors and functional genes. The targets of these miRNAs were enriched in "metabolic process" and "transcription regulation" by using Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. In addition, KEGG pathway analyses revealed the involvement of miRNAs in starch and sucrose metabolism and plant-pathogen interaction metabolism pathways. Noticeably, qRT-PCR expression analysis demonstrated that 9 miRNAs and their targets were existed a negative correlation in P. tomentosa cambial tissues. This study is the first to examine known and novel miRNAs and their potential targets in P. tomentosa cambial tissues during winter and summer transition and identify several candidate genes potentially regulating cambial phase transition, and thus provide a framework for further understanding of miRNAs functions in the regulation of cambial phase transition and wood formation in trees.

TI Use of modified U1 small nuclear RNA for rescue from exon 7 skipping
   caused by 5 '-splice site mutation of human cathepsin A gene
SO GENE

ID SPLICE-SITES; MOUSE MODEL; GALACTOSIALIDOSIS; PROTEIN; DISEASE;
   POSITION+3; DEFICIENCY
AB Cathepsin A (CTSA) is a multifunctional lysosomal enzyme, and its hereditary defect causes an autosomal recessive disorder called galactosialidosis. In a certain number of galactosialidosis patients, a base substitution from adenine to guanine is observed at the +3 position of the 7th intron (IVS7 + 3a > g) of the CTSA gene. With this mutation, a splicing error occurs; and consequently mRNA lacking the 7th exon is produced. This skipping of exon 7 causes a frame shift of the transcripts, resulting in a non-functional CTSA protein and hence galactosialidosis. This mutation seems to make the interaction between the 5'-splice site of intron 7 of pre-mRNA and U1 small nuclear RNA (U1 snRNA) much weaker. In the present study, to produce properly spliced mRNA from the CTSA gene harboring this IVS7 + 3a > g mutation, we examined the possible usefulness of modified U1 snRNA that could interact with the mutated 5'-splice site. Toward this goal, we first prepared a model system using a mutant CTSA mini gene plasmid for delivery into HeLa cells. Then, we examined the effectiveness of modified U1 snRNA on the formation of properly spliced mRNA from this mutant CTSA mini gene. As a result, we succeeded in obtaining improved formation of properly spliced CTSA mRNA. Our results suggest the usefulness of modified U1 snRNA for rescue from exon 7 skipping caused by the IVS7 + 3a > g mutation of the CTSA gene.

AB To examine the physiological roles of arginine vasotocin receptor (AVTR) and isotocin receptor (ITR) in osmoregulation of a euryhaline teleost, the marbled eel (Anguilla marmorata), three different genes coding for AVTRV1a2, AVTRV2 and ITR were cloned by screening an A. marmorata cDNA library. These receptors were expressed differentially and ubiquitously in the eight tissues we examined. The changes in mRNA expression levels of AVTRV1a2, AVTRV2, and ITR were assessed in a time-course study following salinity transfer from fresh water (FW, 0 parts per thousand) to fresh water (FW, 0 parts per thousand), brackish water (BW, 10 parts per thousand) or saline water (SW, 25 parts per thousand). When eels were transferred to BW, mRNA levels underwent an adaptive period, from 0 to 24 h, and a chronic regulatory period, starting at 24 h after transfer. In the adaptive period, the relative mRNA expression of AVTRV1a2, AVTRV2, and ITR increased in BW. But after this adaptive period, the mRNA levels of the three genes were significantly decreased compared to FW (control group, 0 h). The mRNA expression levels of AVTRV1a2, AVTRV2 and ITR were low in SW. The protein level of AVTRV1a2, a key protein in the brain, was also investigated and found to be consistent with mRNA results. Our results indicated that the nonapeptide receptor system may play a role in the acute stress response induced by hyper-osmotic challenge in marbled eels.

AB Background: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a disease associated with high disability and mortality rates. The transitional phase from subacute phase to intermediate phase may play a major role in the process of secondary injury. Changes in protein expression levels have been shown to play key roles in many central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Nevertheless, the roles of proteins in the transitional phase of SCI are not clear.
   Methods: We examined protein expression in a rat model 2 weeks after SCI and identified differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) using isobaric tagging for relative and absolute protein quantification (iTRAQ). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of DEPs were performed. Furthermore, we constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and the top 10 high-degree core nodes were identified. Meanwhile, we validated protein level changes of five high-degree core regulated proteins using Western blots.
   Results: A total of 162 DEPs were identified between the injury group and the control, of which 101 (62.35%) were up-regulated and 61 (37.65%) were down-regulated in the transitional phase of SCI. Key molecular function, cellular components, biological process terms and pathways were identified and may be important mechanisms in the transitional phase of SCI. Alb, Calm1, Vim, Apoe, Syp, P4hb, Cd68, Eef1a2, Rab3a and Lgals3 were the top 10 high-degree core nodes. Western blot analysis performed on five of these proteins showed the same trend as iTRAQ results.
   Conclusion: The current study may provide novel insights into how proteins regulate the pathogenesis of the transitional phase after SCI.

AB Objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate the role of estrogen receptor type 2 gene (ESR2) variant G1730A in myocardial infarction (MI) in young age.
   Methods: Genotyping was performed with restriction fragments length polymorphism method in 158 patients (79.1% men) with MI aged < 50 years (studied group) and in control groups: 150 healthy individuals aged < 50 years (63.3% men) and 202 patients (64.3% men) with MI aged >= 50 years.
   Results: The AA genotype of ESR2 G1730A variant was significantly more frequent in men with MI aged < 50 comparing to men with MI aged >= 50 (21.6% vs. 8.4%, P = 0.004) and to healthy young men (21.6% vs. 11.6%, P = 0.048). There was statistically significant difference between AA genotype and GA + GG genotypes male carriers with MI aged < 50 in median triglyceride (TG) level (2.0 vs. 1.7 mmol/l respectively, p = 0.023).
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest a possible role of ESR2 G1730A variant as the risk factor of MI in a young age not as an independent but a potential risk factor associated with TG level in men but not in women.

AB The myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) proteins play an important role in cellular processes, especially in muscle contraction. The planarian intestine is a fascinating system for studying the organogenesis during regeneration. In this paper, A homolog gene of Rlc, DjRlc, was identified and characterized in Dugesia japonica. The DjRlc sequence analysis revealed that it contains an opening reading frame encoding a putative protein of 175 amino acids with functionally domains that are highly conserved, including an EF-Hand motif and Ca2 + binding sites. Whole mount in situ hybridization showed that DjRlc is predominantly expressed in the intestine of intact and regenerating planarians. The cross sections of planarians revealed that the DjRlc distributes in the muscle of intact planarians. Knockdown of RNA interference of DjRlc by dsRNA-DjRlc affected the intestinal morphology, causing distinct defects in branching morphogenesis. These finding suggest that DjRlc is required for intestinal regeneration.

AB DNA methylation is an important type of epigenetic modifications for the maintenance of genome functionality and stability. Although there are many studies on DNA methylation patterns, mechanisms, and functions, no study has focused on the evolutionary dynamic of DNA methylation. Here, we present the first genome-wide pattern of evolutionary DNA methylation dynamic in protein-coding genes, by grouping the Arabidopsis thaliana protein-coding genes into several conservation levels representing different evolutionary ages, and by investigating their DNA methylation features for three methylation contexts in both genic and flanking regions. The main results include: in a long-term evolutionary period, (1) genic CHG and CHH methylation levels tend to be decreased over time, which is mainly due to the reductions in the number of siRNA target sites in genes; (2) genic CG methylation levels are firstly reduced and then increased on average over evolutionary time, which is the interactional result of increased proportion and decreased CG methylation level of CG methylated genes; and (3) increased gene length and the stochastic methylation mechanism in CG context may further account for genic CG methylation trend in evolution. The diverse DNA methylation mechanisms in different contexts, together with altered gene length in evolution, could interpret the methylation dynamic of protein-coding genes over evolutionary time. This evolutionary perspective provides a dynamic understanding of the intrinsic relationship between DNA methylation and its functional and evolutionary effects on the genomes.

AB The utility of high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data help to accurately identify genomic regions that have undergone positive selection. In this study, the Affymetrix Equine 670 K high-density SNP array was used to genotype Kazakh and Yili horse population. After quality control, 370,227 autosomal SNPs were used to detect selection signatures by using global fixation index (FsT) and cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity (XP-EHH). The database of Ensemble, Genecards, and NCBI were used to make gene annotation and functional analysis. The results showed that there were 134 candidate SNPs overlapped between F-ST and XPEHH in Kazakh horse. We also discovered some potential selective sweep regions associated with milk trait, including NUMB, LGALS2, ADCY8, SLC25A30, and CA8 genes. New findings from this research have potential value for milk traits selecting in horse.

AB Chronic wounds are a common surgical problem exacerbated by diabetes. A hyperglycemic microenvironment induces inflammation and apoptosis, and plays an important role in vascular endothelial cell dysfunction in diabetes. Increasing evidence shows that high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) expression is related to inflammation and apoptosis. The aim of this study was to determine the function of HMGB1 in hyperglycemia induced vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. The results showed that the expression of HMGB1 was increased in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) after exposure to high glucose (25 mM). Downregulation of HMGB1 attenuated the high glucose -induced antiangiogenesis of HUVECs, and the decrease expression of HMGB1 inhibiting HUVEC apoptosis and inflammatory factor expression. In addition, miR-106 expression in HUVECs was decreased under high glucose conditions. Increased miR-106 significantly reversed the high glucose -induced vascular endothelial cell dysfunction by inhibition of HUVEC apoptosis and inflammatory factor expression. However, HMGB1 overexpression attenuated the protective effect of miR-106 on HUVECs in high glucose conditions. This suggested that miR-106 suppressed hyperglycemia -induced vascular endothelial cell dysfunction by targeting HMGB1. Double fluorescent reporter assays confirmed that miR-106 interacted with the 3'-UTR of HMGB1 and inhibited HMGB1 expression. Taken together, these data collectively suggested that miR-106 was a potential molecular target for inhibiting high glucose -induced inflammation and apoptosis by targeting HMGB1.

AB Chemokines represent a superfamily of small secretion proteins that functionally mediate immune cell transmigration in normal or inflammatory conditions. Although anatomic and polygenetic evidence suggests that tree shrews are primate-like species, understanding of the structure and function of tree shrew chemokines has only just commenced. In this study, we cloned tree shrew chemokine CXCL8 and its cognate receptors. Predicted three-dimensional (3D) structures showed that binding domains in CXCL8 and CXCR1/2 were highly conserved between tree shrews and humans. We found that the human CXCL8 (hCXCL8) protein induced migration of tree shrew peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) expressed by CXCR1/2 (tsCXCR1/2). Blocking interaction between hCXCL8 and tsCXCR1/2 with allosteric antagonists (reparixin and SB265610) significantly decreased tree shrew PBMC transmigration. Over -expressing tree shrew CXCR1 in human HEK 293 T cells further enhanced cellular in vitro transmigration. Similar to primate species, our findings suggest that CXCL8 and CXCR1/2 constitute a structurally- and functionally-conserved chemotaxis responsible for tree shrew immune activities.

AB Background: Molecular epidemiological studies have sought associations between Fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene polymorphisms and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk, but findings are inconsistent. Hence, we performed a meta-analysis to clarify this problem.
   Methods: Case-control studies reporting the relationship of three FTO polymorphisms (rs9939609, rs8050136, and rs1421085) and GDM published before June 2018 were searched in 6 electronic databases such as PubMed and Embase. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of associations. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed to evaluate the type 1 and type 2 errors.
   Results: A total of 5 studies involving 703 GDM cases and 2700 controls for rs9939609, 3 studies involving 1144 GDM cases and 909 controls for rs8050136, and 2 studies involving 207 GDM cases and 205 controls for rs1421085, were included in the meta-analysis. No association was observed between the three polymorphisms with the GDM risk under all genetic models. For example, the ORs and its 95% CIs under dominant genetic model were 0.88 (0.59, 1.33) for rs9939609, 1.11 (0.91, 1.35) for rs8050136, and 0.91 (0.58, 1.41) for rs1421085, respectively. Under TSA, there are insufficient levels of evidence for all of these three polymorphisms.
   Conclusion: The present meta-analysis provides statistical evidence indicating a lack of association between FTO polymorphismsand GDM risk. More studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm these null associations.

AB Background: The correlation between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 (MFGE8) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) and metabolism-related indicators are limited. The present study explored the relation in Chinese adults.
   Methods: We conducted a nested case control study based on the Rural Chinese Cohort Study including 408 people with MetS and 408 controls matched by baseline sex, age (2 years), marital status, and residence village. Four polymorphisms were selected and genotyped by using the SNPscan Genotyping system. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the association of MFGE8 polymorphisms with MetS incidence, and linear regression was used to assess the association with metabolism-related indicators in controls.
   Results: We found no significant association of MFGE8 SNPs with MetS incidence or systolic blood pressure, or triglycerides level, or fasting plasma glucose (P > 0.05). However, MFGE8 rs4932450 was negatively associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level under the dominant model (beta = 0.0218, P = 0.007) and the additive model (beta = 0.0175, P = 0.012) and positively associated with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) under the recessive model (beta = 4.8848, P = 0.011). The rs3784751 SNP was associated with increased waist circumference (WC) in controls (beta = 0.0307, P = 0.028).
   Conclusions: MFGE8 polymorphisms were not associated with MetS but were related to DBP, HDL-C level, and WC in Chinese adults.

AB Background: Chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1(SDF-1) 3'A polymorphism has been reported to influence HIV-1 disease pathogenesis and progression, but the results remain controversial.
   Objectives: A meta-analysis was carried out to evaluate their association.
   Methods: Comprehensive literature search of Pubmed, Web of Science and China National Knowledge Infrastructure was conducted. The strength of association between SDF-1 3'A polymorphism and HIV-1 progression was evaluated using the pooled ORs and 95%CIs calculated under different comparison models. Subgroup analyses, heterogeneity, Galbraith plot analyses and test for publication bias were also carried out.
   Results: Our result showed that when compared with the typical progressors, the GA + AA and GA genotype of SDF-1 3'A polymorphism was found positively associated with the long-term non-progressors (LTNP) in the Caucasian HIV-1 infectors (GA + AA vs. GG, OR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.02-2.18, p = 0.040; GA vs. GG, OR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.06-2.35, p = 0.024), while AA genotype was found significantly higher in Asian LTNPs (AA vs. GG + GA, OR = 3.32, 95% CI: 1.25-8.85, p = 0.016).
   Conclusions: Our result suggested that HIV-1 infectors with SDF-1 3'A polymorphism have a higher chance of developing late AIDS than infectors with the SDF-1 GG genotype.

AB Insulin resistance and defects in other related glycemic traits are common findings in the context of Metabolic Syndrome. Although genetic factors are clearly implied in susceptibility, and some gene variants have been identified mainly in populations of European ancestry, little is known about this aspect in admixed populations. The association of insulin resistance, beta-cell function, fasting insulin and glucose levels with 48 gene variants, previously related to metabolic syndrome components, and with the ancestral genetic composition, estimated on 50 ancestry informative markers, was evaluated in 417 individuals from the Colombian admixed population. The Native American genetic ancestry was associated with a low beta-cell function (odds ratio (OR) of 1.73 and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 1.07-2.81, p = 0.026). Significant genotypic associations were obtained (q-value < 0.05) for gene variants in ACE (rs4340; OR (95% CI): 2.79 (1.58-4.91), insulin resistance; mean difference (95% CI): 0.273 (0.141; 0.406), fasting insulin), ADIPOR2 (rs11061971; OR (95% CI): 0.14 (0.04-0.48), low beta-cell function), MTNRIB (rs10830963; mean difference (95% CD: 0.032 (0.013; 0.051), fasting glucose) and GCK (rs4607517; mean difference (95% CI): 0.038 (0.020;0.056) and rs1799884; mean difference (95% CI): 0.027 (0.013-0.041), fasting glucose). Also the well-known gene variants rs7903146 in TCF7L2, and rs17817449 in FTO, were nominally associated with hyperglycemia (rs7903146), as well as with higher fasting insulin levels (rs17817449). Our findings indicate that gene variants in ACE, ADIPOR2, MTNRIB, GCK, TCF7L2 and FTO, are associated with glycemic traits in the admixed Colombian population, while a higher Native American genetic component is related to lower beta-cell function.

AB Background: To identify the most suitable genetic model for detecting the risk of breast cancer (BC)/ovarian cancer (OC) in specific populations.
   Methods: Databases were searched for related studies published up to October 2017. First, VDR genetic polymorphisms were compared in patients with and without cancer. Second, a network meta-analysis was used to reveal the relation between VDR genetic polymorphisms with disease outcomes. Subgroup analyses and a meta regression were performed according to cancer types, ethnicity and genotypic method. The study is registered in PROSPERO with an ID: CRD42017075505.
   Results: Forty-five studies were eligible, which included 65,754 patients and 55 clinical analyses. Of genetic models, results suggested that the recessive model with the CDX2 polymorphism predicted the risk of BC in all cases. The recessive polymorphism model with the rs2228570 (FokI) polymorphism seemed to the best predictor of BC in Caucasian patients, whereas the homozygote model with the CDX2 polymorphism appeared to best predict BC in African-American patients. The homozygote model with the rs2228570 (FokI) polymorphism model appeared to detect the risk of OC in all cases, whereas the heterozygote model with the rs1544410 (BsmI) polymorphism seemed to detect the risk of OC in Caucasian patients.
   Conclusions: By detecting the risk of BC, the recessive model with the rs2228570 (FokI) polymorphism is likely the best genetic model in Caucasian patients, and the homozygote model with the CDX2 polymorphism appears to be best genetic model in African-American patients. Moreover, for detecting clinical risk of OC, heterozygote models with the rs1544410 (BsmI) polymorphism is likely the best genetic model for detecting the risk of OC in Caucasian patients.

ID INTERLEUKIN-18 GENE; IL-18
AB Biliary atresia (BA) has complex genetic etiology, characterized by different levels of hepatic fibrosis after the Kasai procedure and immune responses to the bile duct. As an activator of the two most important inflammatory cells in Biliary atresia (T cells and NK cells), IL-18 is significantly increased in BA patients. This study aims to investigate the association of Interleukin 18(1L-18) with the susceptibility to BA. We examined the association of three polymorphisms (rs549908, rs187238 and rs1946518 in IL-18) and BA susceptibility in a Southern Chinese population composed of 506 cases and 1473 controls. SNP rs187238 and rs1946518 were identified as associated with BA. Interestingly, we also observed that the intragenic synergistic epistasis between SNPs rs187238 and rs1946518 boosting the risk to BA by logistic regression and Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis.

ID ALKALINE-PHOSPHATASE; DYSFUNCTION; DISEASE
AB Objectives: High-salt diet is one of the major risk factors in the development of hypertension. Previous studies have observed a relationship between high-salt induced blood pressure levels and cardiac-cerebral disease. However, the molecular mechanism of high-salt diet induced hypertension and the serious complications in cardiovascular system still remain unknown.
   Materials and methods: We built high-salt diet induced hypertension rat models, and investigated the transcriptomic alteration in four hypertension affected tissues, i.e. ventricle and atrium in heart as well as cortex and medulla in kidney. Differential expression gene (DEG) analysis and further functional annotation including Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was performed to reveal the molecular mechanism of high-salt induced hypertension and organ injury.
   Results: We observed that several genes associated with cardiovascular development and organ injury were significantly dysregulated rat fed with high-salt diet, such as Mmp-15, Igfbp7, Rgs18 and Hras. We demonstrated that differential expressed genes were functionally related to the increased levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP).
   Conclusion: Our study provided new insight about molecular mechanism of high-salt induced hypertension and heart and kidney damage.

AB Highly conserved 18S rDNA sequences encode ribosomal RNA and evolve in a concerted manner. In this study, 178 sequences of 18S rDNA from the ridge-eyed flounder, Pleuronichthys cornutus, were analyzed. The total sequences yielded five distinguishable types of 18S rDNA A, B, R, S, and L-that were defined based on sequence alignments, clone clustering, and recombination detection. The length of 176 clones ranged from 1838 bp to 1846 bp, with one particularly short clone reaching only 1466 bp and one long clone reaching up to1869 bp. As per current criteria for pseudogene inference, Type S was inferred to be a pseudogene due to its truncated length (380 bp) and low minimum free energy (- 536.9 kcal-mol(-1)). Type L had a unique 20-bp insertion and was also predicted to be as a pseudogene. Types A and B showed 31 differential sites, which in Type A was consistent with 18S rDNA sequences found in six other flounders, while Type B and recombinant Type R were not. Maximum K2P genetic distances were calculated within Type B (0.0232) and R (0.0313); these were much higher than that of Type A (0.0093) or between the six flounders (0.011). Only Type A was detected by reverse transcription experiments and linked to functional ITS1 and 5.8S fragments; Types B and R were linked to both functional and pseudo genes. Accordingly, Type A is likely the functional gene, and Types B and R are probable pseudogenes. The heterogeneity of the five types revealed that 18S rDNA sequences evolved in a non-concerted evolution manner in P. comutus. Furthermore, our results suggest that more features should be used to identify functional or pseudo genes.

AB Introduction: Calpainopathy is an autosomal recessive form of limb girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) caused by mutations in the CAPN3 gene. CAPN3 is a Ca2+-dependent cystein protease consisting of 821 amino acids. LGMD is a highly heterogeneous disorder and mutation identification of this disease by Sanger sequencing of all genes is expensive and time consuming. Using autozygosity mapping is an effective approach to address this issue.
   Methods: We used two sets of multiplex STR (Short tandem repeat) markers linked to CAPN3, DYSF, SGCA, SGCB, SGCG, SGCD genes following sequencing of the CAPN3 gene. In silico analysis and mutation detection in one hundred ethnically matched healthy individuals were carried out to determine the pathogenicity of novel mutations. Sequence variant interpretation was performed using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guideline.
   Results: Sixteen out of 50 families linked to the CAPN3 gene. In this study, mutations were found in 14 out of 16 families including 4 novel (c.1894A > T, c.567delG, c.2254-2256delAAC, and c.2373C > T) and 9 previously reported mutations consisting of 5 missense (c.2105C > T, c.2243G > A, c.1714C > T, c.291C > A, c.956C > T), 3 splice site (c.2380 + 2 T > G, c.946-2A > G, c.380G > A), and one indel (c.2257delinsAA) mutations.
   Discussion: The c.2105C > T was found to be the most frequent mutation in this study. The results of this study revealed that most cases with splicing, frame shift and nonsense mutations experienced more severe clinical manifestations. Nonetheless, this should be confirmed by further studies on larger sample size.

AB Uterine infection in dairy cows causes great economic loss. In bovine endometrial cells, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated increase in interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 8 (IL-8) mRNA is crucial for the inflammatory response; however, the regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated the role of DNA methylation in IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression following LPS-induction in bovine endometrial cells. IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression was evaluated under DNA methylation inhibition using 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytodine (5Aza) following LPS stimulation. Expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B), methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and DNA methylation at IL-6 and IL-8 regions, were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) following 24 h of LPS treatment. Inhibition of DNA methylation significantly enhanced LPS-induced IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression. LPS increased IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression, and decreased methylation levels of specific CpG sites at the IL-6 promoter (at 366 and 660) and the IL-8 promoter (at 120 and 48) after 24 h. Furthermore, LPS treatment for 24 h significantly increased DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, and MeCP2 mRNA expression. Our results indicate that treating bovine endometrial cells with LPS induces the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA regulated by IL-6 and IL-8 promoter methylation.

AB Pasteuria penetrans is an endospore forming hyperparasitic bacterium of the plant-pathogenic root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita. For successful parasitization, the first step is adherence of bacterial endospores onto the cuticle surface of nematode juveniles. The knowledge of molecular intricacies involved during this adherence is sparse. Here, we identified a M. incognita selenium-binding protein (Mi-SeBP-1) differentially expressed during the initial interaction of M. incognita and P. penetrans, and show that it is involved in modulating parasitic adhesion of bacterial endospores onto nematode cuticle. Selenium-binding proteins (SeBPs) are selenium associated proteins important for growth regulation, tumor prevention and modulation of oxidation/reduction in cells. Although reported to be present in several nematodes, the function of SeBPs is not known in Phylum Nematoda. In situ hybridization assay localized the Mi-SeBP-1 mRNA to the hypodermal cells. RNAi-mediated silencing of Mi-SeBP-1 significantly increased the adherence of P. penetrans endospores to the nematode juvenile cuticle. Silencing of Mi-SeBP-1 did not change the nematodes ability to parasitize plants and reproduction potential within the host. These results suggest that M. incognita Mi-SeBP-1 might be involved in altering the attachment of microbial pathogens on the nematode cuticle, but is not involved in nematode-host plant interaction. This is the first report for a function of SeBP in Phylum Nematoda.

AB Chronic intestinal inflammation predisposes patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) to Colitis Associated Cancer (CAC). In the setting of chronic inflammation, microsatellite instability (MSI) results from early loss of DNA damage response (DDR) genes, ultimately leading to tumor formation. Despite continued efforts to improve early detection of high risk, pre-dysplastic regions in IBD patients, current macroscopic and genetic surveillance modalities remain limited. Therefore, understanding the regulation of key DDR genes in the progression from colitis to cancer may improve molecular surveillance of CAC. To evaluate DDR gene regulation in the transition from colitis to tumorigenesis, we utilized the well-established Azoxymethane/Dextran Sodium Sulfate (AOM/DSS) pre-clinical murine model of CAC in C57BL/6 mice. In order to assess colonic tumor burden in the setting of mutagen and intestinal irritation, tumors were visualized and graded in real time through high resolution murine colonoscopy. Upon sacrifice, colons were opened and assessed for macroscopic tumor via high magnification surgical lenses (HMSL). Tissues were then sectioned and separated into groups based on the presence or absence of macroscopically visible tumor. Critical DDR genes were evaluated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Interestingly, colon tissue with macroscopically visible tumor (MVT) and colon tissue prior to observable tumor (the non-macroscopically visible tumor-developing group, NMVT) were identical in reduced mRNA expression of mlhl, anapcl, and ercc4 relative to colitic mice without mutagen, or those receiving mutagen alone. Colitis alone was sufficient to reduce colonic ercc4 expression when compared to NMVT mice. Therefore, reduced ercc4 expression may mark the early transition to CAC in a pre-clinical model, with expression reduced prior to the onset of observable tumor. Moreover, the expression of select DDR genes inversely correlated with chronicity of inflammatory disease. These data suggest ercc4 expression may define early stages in the progression to CAC.

AB Objective: To investigate the clinical significance of long non-coding RNA LINC01617 in esophageal cancer and explore the effect of LINC0161.7 on the proliferation and metastasis of esophageal cancer cells.
   Methods: Real time fluorescence PCR was used to detect the expression of LINC01617 in 142 cases of esophageal cancer and adjacent tissues. The relationship between the expression level of LINC01617 and the survival rate of esophageal cancer patients was analyzed. The function of LINC01617 was detected in esophageal cancer cell lines. The tumor growth ability test was carried out in the nude mice.
   Results: We found that LINC01617 was overexpressed in esophageal cancer, and its expression was associated with poor prognosis of esophageal cancer. In vitro experiments confirmed that knockout of LINC01617 significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of esophageal cancer cells. Moreover, knockout of LNC01617 can inhibit the growth of esophageal cancer in nude mice. The Akt pathway may be involved in the regulation of cell activity in esophageal cancer.
   Conclusions: LINC01617 may be involved in the occurrence and development of esophageal cancer, suggesting that LINC01617 can be used as a biomarker and potential therapeutic target for esophageal cancer.

AB MicroRNA (miRNA) are endogenous small noncoding RNA gene products, on average 22 nt long, that play important regulatory roles in mediating gene expression by binding to and targeting mRNAs for degradation or translational repression. In this paper we identify both novel and conserved miRNA sequences present in the genome of the gray mouse lemur, Microcebus marinus. In total, 122 conserved and 44 novel miRNA were identified with high confidence from the lemur genome (Mmur_2.0) and were used for expression analysis. All conserved and novel miRNA were subjected to relative quantification by RT-qPCR in liver samples from control and torpid lemurs. A total of 26 miRNA (16 conserved and 10 novel) showed increased levels during primate torpor, whereas 31 (30 conserved and 1 novel) decreased. Additional in silico mapping of the predicted mRNA targets of torpor-responsive mature miRNA suggested that miRNA that increased during torpor were collectively involved in cell development and survival pathways, while miRNA that decreased were enriched in targeting immune function. Overall, the study suggests new regulatory mechanisms of primate torpor via miRNA action.

AB SKT11, an important tumor suppressor, is a member of the serine/threonine kinase family and plays a crucial role in tumor invasion and metastasis by activated adenine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and AMPK-related kinase proteins. However, few studies have elaborated its regulations of development and metabolism of cartilage, as well as skeleton. This study was aimed to investigate the role of Stk11-knockout in chondrocyte by bioinformatics analysis. The gene expression profiles for Stk11-knockout and wild-type mice were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A total of 1104 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by Affymetrix Expression Console and Transcriptome Analysis Console (TAC) software, including 560 up-regulated and 544 down-regulated genes. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were built by mapping DEGs into STRING, in which hub genes such as Fos, Pdgfrb, Pdgfra, Flt1/Vegfr1, Smad3, Mapk14, Twist and Aurkb were further identified. For the up-regulated genes, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and Wnt signaling pathway were two main pathways in the KEGG analysis, and ossification and extracellular matrix organization were involved in the Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. On the other hand, the down regulated genes were mainly involved in systemic lupus erythematosus and alcoholism pathways, and B cell receptor signaling pathway and immune system process biological processes. MiRNA-9, miRNA-134, miRNA-492, miRNA-224 and miRNA-142-5p were identified as key regulators in the miRNAs-DEG regulatory network. Additionally, OSF2/RUNX2, and NFAT regulated DEGs collectively in the transcription factor regulatory network. The results of RT-PCR verified that the expression of hub genes, transcription factors and miRNAs in our experiment were basically consistent with the microarray hybridization. In this study, we provide an insight into the role of Stk11 in chondrocyte and identify novel genes related to Stk11.

AB The quality of pear and other fruit affects their economic value by determining their attractiveness to the consumer. For this reason the two most important quality traits, namely the sugar content and the aroma, have been the focus of much research. This research has been conducted both on the biochemical characteristics of sugar and aroma of fruits and on the activity of enzymes related to their metabolism. In this study, by analyzing the transcriptome of pear fruit, we built the first co-expression network of the genes related to sugar metabolism and those related to aroma, to reveal their connections. Genes that encode beta-glucosidases and sorbitol dehydrogenases are shown to be the hub genes within this network. This study has demonstrated the power of such network analysis for the first time in a non-model organism. Our research can lead to new discoveries that go beyond the previous focus on individual genes.

AB Boscalid is an agrochemical recently developed for crop protection and the most significant member of the succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor group of fungicides. In this study, a collection of high-affinity monoclonal antibodies was generated to boscalid. By using a series of haptens with a linker at alternative tethering sites of the boscalid framework, specific antibodies were isolated as well as antibodies that also recognized the main boscalid metabolite. Two immunoassays were developed using different ELISA formats. Optimized assays displayed very high sensitivities (limits of detection were near 0.01 mu g/L). Trueness and precision for the determination of the target analyte in strawberry samples was evaluated. Moreover, immunoassay performance was validated with a reference chromatographic method using QuEChERS extracts of fruits from fungicide-treated crops. A monitoring study with strawberry samples from local markets was carried out by immunoassay, showing an occurrence of boscalid of 15% with a maximum residue concentration of 43 mu g/kg.

AB The present study is focused on heat-induced changes in the structure and antigenic properties of gluten proteins. The thermal dependent behavior of glutenins and gliadins was analyzed through intrinsic fluorescence parameters, phase diagram method, and quenching experiments using acrylamide and iodide. Unfolding events were registered in the phase diagram of glutenins up to 80 degrees C, followed by partial refolding and aggregation at even higher temperatures. The gliadins structure appeared to be progressively disorganized with the temperature increase up to 100 degrees C. The thermally denatured proteins exposed different functional groups leading to 64% reduction of the antigenic properties. No significant differences in terms of residual antigenicity were observed among samples treated at temperatures over 60 degrees C for 20 or 60 min. Finally, changes in the linear epitopes exposure and location of conformational epitopes of alpha-/beta-, gamma- and omega 5-gliadins were highlighted after performing molecular dynamics simulations to heat the proteins from 25 degrees C to 100 degrees C.

AB Understanding the mechanism of interaction between food proteins and bioactives constitutes the preliminary step to design food grade nanocarriers. We investigated the interaction between cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), and 20 nm-sized sodium caseinate nanoparticles (NaCas) at pH 7 and pH 2 by fluorescence spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering. The characterization of the C3G-NaCas interaction indicated that the fluorescence quenching mechanism was predominantly static. C3G interacted with two sets of binding sites with association constants Ka of 10(6) and 10(5) M-1. Electrostatic interactions dominated at pH 7, while hydrophobic effects were the main force at pH 2. Interestingly, the two sets of binding sites were discriminated by ionic strength at pH 7. The binding of C3G slightly modified the average diameter of NaCas nanoparticles without alteration of its surface charge suggesting a complexation of C3G molecules in the internal casein structure. Thus, NaCas constitutes a putative nanocarrier for anthocyanins in new functional foods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To update the current situation on salt, fat and fatty acid composition of processed foods, a study including a wide range of different food categories was conducted in Portugal. Different validated analytical techniques were used, and a PCA and correlation analysis were conducted to establish a trend between the different components in each food category. The highest salt content was found in snacks, fast-food, sauces and ready-to-eat meals, while the saturated fatty acids were higher (p < .05) in bakery products, cookies, biscuits and wafers, and snacks.
   The highest levels of trans fatty acids were found in the fast-food group, followed by the snacks, potato and potato-products and bakery products. A significant positive correlation (p < .05) was found between salt and fat content in ready-to-eat meals and in the potato and potato-products. The PCA analysis identified total fat, low trans fatty acids and high salt content as distinctive characteristics of some food categories.

AB The validation of a rapid, precise (RSD < 4.6%), reliable and sensitive (LOD=0.026 mu g/mL) liquid chromatography method for vitamin C quantification in foods (infant formulae, n=4; follow-on formulae, n=3; processed cereal based-foods, n=7; and baby foods, n=10) for infants and young children is described. Vitamin C content ranged from 1.50 to 144 mg/100 g. A comparison between the declared values and the measured concentrations, as well as the accordance of these values with the tolerances, was performed. For 50% of the analysed foods, the measured vitamin C content was higher than the declared value. However, all the analysed foods were in compliance with EU legislation concerning the maximum limits of vitamin C added to foods. The results obtained will be very useful for analytical laboratory control, risk assessment, establishment of maximum limits, development and implementation of guidelines regarding nutrient recommendations and estimation of vitamin C intake among infants and young children.

AB An electrochemical methodology for the characterization of mycotoxin-producing fungal species from the genera Aspergillus and Fusarium using solid-state voltammetry is described. Upon attachment of fungal colony microsamples to glassy carbon electrodes in contact with aqueous acetate buffer, characteristic voltammetric signals mainly associated to the oxidation of polyphenolic metabolites are recorded. The possibility of fungi-localized electrochemical processes was assessed by means of electron microscopy and field emission scanning electrochemical microscopy coupled to the application of oxidative potential inputs. Using pattern recognition methods, the determined voltammetric profiles were able to discriminate between mycotoxin-producing fungi from different sections and to identify selected toxigenic species of the Aspergillus and Fusarium genera isolated from grapes and cereals.

AB This study compared a hydroxyl radical-generating system (HRGS) (0.05-0.2 mM Fe3+ + 0.6 mM H2O2) and a glycation system (GLY) (0.05-0.2 mM Fe3+ + 0.05 M glucose) for their ability to promote protein carbonylation and tryptophan depletion in myofibrillar proteins, ovalbumin, b-lactoglobulin, soy protein and human serum albumin. Animal-source were more susceptible to protein carbonylation than soy proteins and globular were more susceptible than fibrillar proteins. Both systems promoted tryptophan loss and the formation of protein carbonyls and iron had a clear dose-effect in most systems and proteins. In the tested conditions, the GLY environment was more effective than the HRGS system in promoting the oxidative damage to food proteins. According to the results, glucose and H2O2 may compete for iron for the production of glycosylative and oxidative species, respectively. This study provides original insight into the chemical mechanisms implicated in the oxidative and glycosylative damage to food proteins. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Indospicine, a non-proteinogenic analogue of arginine, occurs only in Indigofera plant species and accumulates in the tissues of animals grazing on Indigofera. Canine deaths have resulted from the consumption of indospicine-contaminated meat but only limited information is available regarding indospicine toxicity in humans. In this study three human cell lines, Caco-2 (colorectal adenocarcinoma), HT29-MTX-E12 (colorectal adenocarcinoma) and HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), were used to investigate the cytotoxicity of indospicine and its metabolite 2-aminopimelic acid in comparison to arginine. Indospicine and 2-aminopimelic acid were more cytotoxic than arginine, displaying the highest toxicity in HepG2 liver cells. Intestinal transport in vitro also revealed a 2-fold higher transport rate of indospicine compared to arginine. The sensitivity of HepG2 cells to indospicine is consistent with observed canine hepatotoxicity, and considering the higher in vitro transport of indospicine across an intestinal barrier, it is possible that similar ill effects could be seen in humans consuming contaminated meat.

AB In this report, a UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, zearalenone, deoxynivalenol, fumonisins, T-2 and HT-2 toxins, fusarenone X, diacetoxyscirpenol, and 3-and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol in feedstuffs was developed. A quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer detector (QTOF-MS) operating in full scan mode was combined with the UPLC-ESI-MS/MS system to confirm the identity of detected mycotoxins and to identify other possible microbial metabolites occurring in samples. Sixty two feed samples from the Spanish market were analyzed. Extraction of metabolites was carried out with acetonitrile-water-formic acid (80:19:1, v/v/v). Method detection and quantification limits and performance criteria set by Commission Regulation (EC) No 401/2006 were fulfilled. Relatively high levels of the main regulated mycotoxins and presence of non-regulated mycotoxins in feed samples were found. This is the first study in which mycotoxins and other microbial metabolites occurring in feed are studied using a UPLC-QTOF-MS system being therefore a reference report.

AB We developed an on-packaging colorimetric sensor label that can detect the aldehyde emission of apples based on Methyl Red. The sensor label was constructed using printable inks on paper medium and relied on the change in basicity caused by the nucleophilic addition reaction between aldehyde and hydroxide via the Cannizzaro reaction. The sensor can be used to detect aldehyde in solution and vapor. Sensitivity and stability toward changes in humidity were achieved by altering the concentration of OH-. Under exposure to ripening apples, the label changed color from yellow to orange, and then to red. The degree of ripeness was estimated by a sensory test and texture analysis. The color change of sensor label had showed a similar tendency to the changes in the parameters of the sensory test, soluble solid content, and hardness. Therefore, the sensor label can be used for real lime on-package ripeness monitoring of apples during their shelf life.

AB Sweet-tasting proteins may be useful as low-calorie sugar substitutes in foods, beverages, and medicines. Brazzein is an attractive sweetener because of its high sweetness, sugar-like taste, and good stability at high temperature and wide pH ranges. To investigate the bioactivities of brazzein, the antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-allergic activities were determined in vitro. Brazzein showed no antibacterial and antifungal activities, although it showed approximately 45% or greater similarity to defensin, which has antimicrobial effects, and drosomycin, which is used as an antifungal agent. However, brazzein exhibited strong antioxidant effects, showing ABTS radical scavenging activity (IC50 = 12.55 mu M) and DPPH activity (IC50 > 30 mu M). Brazzein also showed anti-inflammatory activity and anti-allergic activity in a beta-hexosaminidase assay (IC50 > 15 mu M) and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition assay (IC50 = 12.62 mu M), respectively. These results suggest that brazzein has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-allergic activities and considerable potential as a functional sweetener. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study describes the successful development of new gluten-free (GF) mini sponge cakes fortified with broccoli leaves. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of broccoli leaf powder (BLP) on the content of biologically active compounds and the antioxidant capacity of GF mini sponge cakes. Broccoli leaf powder was a good source of nutritional components, including proteins and minerals, as well as bioactive compounds such as glucosinolates and phenolics. Glucosinolate content was higher than expected, which points to a synergistic interaction between bioactive compounds and the food matrix. The incorporation of BLP into GF mini sponge cakes significantly (p < 0.05) increased their antioxidant capacity. The overall sensory acceptance of GF mini sponge cakes was affected by increasing BLP content. The addition of 2.5% BLP as a starch substitute resulted in an optimal improvement in the nutraceutical potential of GF cakes without compromising their sensory quality.

AB The aim of our study was to examine the degradation of veterinary antibiotics in milk during boiling. Raw cow milk samples were fortified with the target compounds and boiled for various short time-intervals prevailing in household practice. Antibiotic concentrations were determined by LC-MS/MS measurements. Degradation rate constants, half-lives and degradation percentages were calculated. Cefoperazone and cloxacillin proved to be the less and the most heat-stable substance, with 78.3% and 9.6% degradation in 300 s respectively. Aminoglicosides exhibited intermediate (33.8-43.6%), tetracycline (30.4%) and trimethoprim (22.6%) intermediate to high heat stability. The results demonstrate that antibiotic residues possibly present in raw milk exhibit high heat stability when treated for few seconds at around 100 degrees C. Keeping the milk at this temperature for at least two minutes would allow varying decrease in the amount of some compounds, but does not totally eliminate the potential risks to the consumer's health.

AB Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the polymorphs and liquid state of anhydrous milk fat, with emphasis placed on the thermal evolution of the ester carbonyl stretching modes (1800-1700 cm(-1)) and the comparative study of the Raman-active C=C (1660 cm(-1)) and CeH (3000-2700 cm(-1)) vibrational modes. Specific Raman signatures in the crystalline phase were found and attributed to the coexistence of two groups of triglycerides. This was confirmed using differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction methods. In the ester carbonyl band, the effect of changing temperature on both the number of modes and new defined intensity ratios was studied and enabled polymorph discrimination. C-H stretching signals increased with polymorph stability, indicating the dominance of antisymmetric C-H methylene vibrations as the anhydrous milk fats crystal lattice became more ordered. The change in intensity of the C-H stretching bands as a function of temperature was used to probe the order-disorder transition.

AB Tannins are polyphenolic compounds extensively present in plants and used by food industry as processing aids. Due to the heterogeneity of plant sources, actions involved in food processing and tannin commercial costs can be different. In the last years different approaches aimed at correctly identifying the tannin botanical origin have been developed, in order to satisfy the industry's request to verify product labels. This work aimed to define the glycosidic simple phenolic profile of a large selection of monovarietal commercial tannins of different origin, using a high-resolution untargeted approach. Using accurate mass, isotopic pattern and MS/MS fragmentation, 167 precursors, 89 as monoglycosylated and 78 as diglycosylated derivatives were tentatively identified in tannins, validating the untargeted approach with 3 custom-synthesized glycosidic precursors. Almost all tannin botanical varieties were shown to be characterised by a specific glycosylated phenolic profile, providing possible tools for tannin classification in the case of glycosylphenol standard availability.

AB Different approaches to analysing the botanical origin of tannins have been proposed in the last fifteen years, but are generally time consuming and require the use of advanced instrumentation. This study aims to suggest an effective, easy, rapid and cheap method based on the acquisition of FT-IR spectra of 3 g/L hydroalcoholic tannin solutions, overcoming possible disadvantages due to sample or particle size inhomogeneity. 114 commercial powder tannins from 7 different botanical sources (oak, chestnut, gall, quebracho, tea, grape skin and grape seed) were collected and the FT-IR spectra were acquired in the region 926-5011 cm(-1). Partial Least Squares regression, Discriminant Analysis and Artificial Neural Networks were applied to FT-IR spectra to investigate the possibility of differentiating the 7 botanical origins. The best results were obtained using Discriminant Analysis, with 95% correct re-classification, and 97% grouping of grape skin and seed in a single source. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Insects have recently emerged as a new protein source for both food and feed. Some studies have already demonstrated that insects' meal can be successfully added to animal feed without threaten animals' growth indices. However, effective and validated tests to individuate insects' meal in feed are strongly needed to meet traceability and safety concerns and to support the European legislation under development. Spectroscopic techniques represent valuable rapid and non-destructive methods that can be applied for in-situ analysis in feed production plants or in farms.
   In this work a Fourier Transform Near Infrared spectroscopy imaging (FT NIR) as a potential screening method for the detection and quantification of insects' meal in feed is presented. Discriminant analysis was used for the automatic recognition of insects' meal fragments into the feed matrix. Moreover, the possibility to quantify insect's meal in feed sample was successfully tested. The proposed method is a rapid and green strategy for feed contamination screening analysis.

AB A method combining aqueous extraction, reversed-phase high-performance capillary liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection (cLC-DAD) and chemometric tools, was developed to determine phenolic compounds in residual brewing yeast. The effect of temperature, nature of extraction solvent and method for separation of extract solution were studied to optimize the extraction conditions on the basis of total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoids content (TFC) and antioxidant capacity. Polyphenols were determined by cLC-DAD. Flavonols as rutin and kaempferol, flavonoids as naringin, phenolic acids as gallic acid and antioxidants as trans-ferulic and p-coumaric acids were found and quantified in the brewing residue. Data were subjected to evaluation using multifactor ANOVA and principal component analysis (PCA), both showing that lyophilization pretreatment affects the content of individual polyphenols and that residual brewing yeast contains higher polyphenol amounts than the liquid beer waste. The obtained results suggest that residual brewing yeast could be a source of polyphenols. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of temperature (6, 15 and 30 degrees C) during ageing on the colour, phytochemical composition and bioactivity of roselle wine was investigated over 12 months. At the end of ageing, wines stored at 6 degrees C had the highest colour density and lowest polymeric anthocyanins. The initial concentration of most of the individual phenolic compounds decreased during ageing, with reduction of monomeric anthocyanins contributing to the formation of anthocyanin-derivatives (pyranoanthocyanins), eight of which were identified tentatively and reported here for the first time in roselle wine. The decrease in individual phenolic compounds did not affect inhibition of alpha-glucosidase (maltase) activity, which remained relatively low but stable throughout ageing. Diethyl succinate was the only volatile clearly influenced by ageing temperature, with the most pronounced effect at 30 degrees C (similar to 256 fold increase). In summary, the final concentrations of anthocyanins and diethyl succinate were the major compounds influenced by ageing temperature. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A tomato essence was developed for potential flavor enhancement of juices and other tomato products. The changes in the flavor profile that occur during tomato processing in plum tomatoes were characterized and compared using purge and trap gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (PT-GC-MS). The pilot tomato juices mostly suffered losses in green and fruity note-related compounds. Of the four essence fractions produced, Fractions 1 and 2 were most complementary to the undesirable flavor changes encountered during thermal processing. Fraction 1 was characterized as a "green tomato note", with substantially higher amounts of 2-isobutylthiazole, alpha-citral, hexanal, 3-hexen-1-ol, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one; Fraction 2 was described as a "fruity tomato note" with relatively percentage change of compounds; and Fractions 3 and 4 were described as "cooked tomato note" and "faint tomato note", respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of adding tomato essence to impart desirable flavor attributes to processed tomato products.

AB The relationship between wine flavour and wine volatile composition is well recognised, however with thousands of compounds in wine the exact nature of individual contributions may be hard to determine due to synergistic and masking effects. Untargeted chemical analyses coupled with descriptive sensory and partial least squares regression modelling can help unravel interactions to identify groups of compounds that contribute to sensory properties. Variable selection is often applied prior to modelling to eliminate irrelevant variables. In this study, sensory references used to train the sensory panel were chemically analysed and employed to reduce the number of variables used to construct the models. This novel variable selection approach was compared against the inclusion of all variables and the most commonly applied variable selection method - analysis of variance. Models constructed from variables present in sensory references performed similarly to other models and identified interesting groups of compounds to investigate further.

AB Amaranth species are globally grown food crops. However, knowledge about the composition of their secondary metabolites is insufficient. Here, selected hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, flavonoid glycosides, carotenoids and chlorophylls in the leaves of 14 genotypes from six different amaranth species were identified and quantified. For the first time, caffeic acid esters of isocitric and several aldaric acids were isolated and quantified in a leafy food matrix. High concentrations of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and chlorophylls, and moderate amounts of flavonoids and carotenoids were detected. A hierarchical clustering method of the metabolic profiles followed by Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR fingerprinting was used to group the genotypes. Using this combined approach, three main groups of amaranth species were assigned. The information provided in this study increases the attractiveness of the amaranth genus as a food crop due to its strong diversity of plant secondary metabolites that are associated with numerous health-promoting benefits.

AB Gluten proteins of certain cereals (wheat, rye and barley) can trigger hypersensitivity reactions. In special dietary products for people intolerant to gluten, their amount must not exceed the regulatory threshold levels. The source of gluten can influence gluten quantitation due to variability in protein profile of grain cultivars and species. A proper reference material is crucial for accurate measurement of gluten and evaluating assay performance. It should be as representative of the commodity as possible. In this study, protein content and composition of a set of 23 common wheat cultivars grown around the world were determined. According to qualitative and quantitative selection criteria, cultivars that possessed a typical gluten composition were identified. Five cultivars were selected for subsequent experiments to confirm their suitability as a basis for reference material production. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The stepwise approach takes advantage of simple, versatile, low-cost screening tools that can be applied to several posts of the saffron trade chain to specifically detect adulteration with carminic acid (CA). This natural dye is of insect origin and should not be present in Kosher and Halal foods such as saffron. For gross adulteration levels (>25.0%, w/w) reaction with diphenylamine-sulfuric acid was found adequate to indicate the presence of extraneous matter but not its identity. FT-IR analysis of the dry material combined with chemometrics served to rapidly sort out samples containing > 10.0% CA without any sample pretreatment except grinding. Aqueous extracts prepared according to ISO 3632-2 were then examined by tristimulus colorimetry and derivative UV-Vis spectrometry to detect adulteration down to the level of 2.0% (w/w). Determination of CA down to 0.2%, w/w was achieved by RP-HPLC-DAD using aqueous acetonitrile elution solvent (pH = 2.8). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In South Africa, almost 50% of the people who take loans cannot afford it. Previously, lenders were able to make deductions from a borrower's payslip but this practice is no longer allowed. Consequently, lenders are now far more vulnerable to default particularly if these loans are no longer being backed by any form of meaningful collateral. The aim of this study is to investigate the predictive power of some of the more popular classification techniques currently in use with specific attention to predicting the propensity for a borrower who is 90 days or more in arrears on an unsecured loan to pay over a fixed window period at least 30% of the total amount due. Results show that these classification techniques perform best for predicting payment patterns over a future horizon period between 3 and 12 months. It is also found that generalized additive models (especially using a generalized extreme value link function), which have not been extensively explored within the credit scoring literature, outperformed all the other classifiers considered in this study.

AB In this paper, a formal method is presented to: (1) establish a system to visualize huge quantities of related information (2) graphically show the degree of similarity between these related documents (3) navigate between related documents so that the views are reconfigured in a dynamic and gradual way. This method uses, as input, a set of documents that have been related using any existing algorithm (relationships based on contents, on votes to contents, on social relations, on demographic information, etc.). The proposed method includes two different visualization and navigational versions related to: (a) visualization by explicit graph and (b) visualization by implicit graph. As a summary, the following characteristics are presented: (1) this method maximizes the information that is displayed at each moment, so that a balance is found between: (a) the number of relations shown, (b) the number of documents viewed, (c) the amount of information presented by each document and (d) how to show the degree of similarity between documents, (2) the method includes specific rules of interaction with the user to allow navigation in a simple, gradual and intuitive way.

TI Preparing for safety monitoring after rotavirus vaccine

ID CASE-DEFINITION; INFANTS; EFFICACY; RISK
AB Intussusception is the invagination of one segment of the bowel into a distal segment, characterized by symptoms of bloody stool, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Previous studies have found regional differences in incidence but the etiology of most intussusception cases is unknown. Rotavirus vaccines were associated with a slightly of increased risk of intussusception in post-licensure evaluations in high and middle-income countries, but not in low income African countries. To describe the baseline epidemiology of intussusception in young children prior to rotavirus vaccine implementation, active sentinel hospital surveillance for intussusception in children < 2 years of age was conducted in 4 low income Asian countries (Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Vietnam). Over a 24-month period, 15 sites enrolled 1,415 intussusception cases, of which 70% were enrolled in Vietnam. Overall, 61% of cases were male and 1% (n = 16) died, ranging from 8% in Pakistan to 0% in Vietnam. The median age of cases enrolled ranged from 6 months in Bangladesh and Pakistan to 12 months in Vietnam. The proportion of cases receiving surgical management was 100% in Bangladesh, 88% in Pakistan, 61% in Nepal, and 1% in Vietnam. The high proportion of males and median age of cases around 6 months of age found in this regional surveillance network are consistent with previous descriptions of the epidemiology of intussusception in these countries and elsewhere. Differences in management and the fatality rate of cases between the countries likely reflect differences in access to healthcare and availability of diagnostic modalities. These baseline data will be useful for post-rotavirus vaccine introduction safety monitoring. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) causes heart- and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Erythrocytes are the main target cells for PRV. HSMI causes significant economic losses to the salmon aquaculture industry, and there is currently no vaccine available. PRV replicates and assembles within cytoplasmic structures called viral factories, mainly organized by the non-structural viral protein mu NS. In two experimental vaccination trials in Atlantic salmon, using DNA vaccines expressing different combinations of PRV proteins, we found that expression of the non-structural proteins mu NS combined with the cell attachment protein sigma 1 was associated with an increasing trend in lymphocyte marker gene expression in spleen, and induced moderate protective effect against HSMI.

AB Background: Invasive meningococcal disease has its highest incidence in infants. Co-administration of serogroup B (4CMenB) and quadrivalent conjugate (MenACWY-CRM) vaccines could protect against 5 clinically-relevant meningococcal serogroups.
   Methods: This phase 3b, open, multicenter study (NCT02106390), conducted in Mexico and Argentina, enrolled and randomized (1:1:1) 750 healthy infants to receive either 4CMenB co-administered with MenACWY-CRM (4CMenB/MenACWY group), 4CMenB (4CMenB group), or MenACWY-CRM alone (MenACWY group) at ages 3, 5, 7 and 13 months. Non-inferiority of immune responses of co-administration to single administration of vaccines was assessed at 1 month post-booster dose (primary objective). Immunogenicity was evaluated pre- and 1 month post-primary and booster vaccinations using human serum bactericidal assay (hSBA). Safety was assessed.
   Results: At 1 month post-booster vaccination, between-group hSBA geometric mean titer (GMT) ratios ranged from 0.89 to 1.03 for serogroup B strains (group 4CMenB/MenACWY over 4CMenB), and from 1.05 to 2.48 for ACWY serogroups (group 4CMenB/MenACWY over MenACWY). The lower limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence intervals for all GMT ratios was >0.5; the primary objective was demonstrated. Across all groups and serogroup B strains, 68-100% and 87-100% of children had hSBA titers >= 5 at 1 month post-primary and booster vaccination, respectively. For serogroups ACWY, >= 96% (postprimary vaccination) and >= 98% (post-booster vaccination) of children in all groups had hSBA titers >= 4. Post-booster vaccination, GMTs increased >= 5.99-fold from pre-booster values for each strain/serogroup. Solicited adverse events (AEs) were more frequent in groups 4CMenB/MenACWY and 4CMenB than in MenACWY; incidence of all other AEs was similar between groups. Serious AEs were reported for 6, 13, and 11 participants in groups 4CMenB/MenACWY, 4CMenB, and MenACWY, respectively; 1 (group 4CMenB) was considered vaccine-related.
   Conclusion: Immune responses elicited by co-administration of 4CMenB and MenACWY-CRM was non-inferior to single immunization. Co-administration of vaccines was immunogenic and well tolerated in infants. (C) 2018 GlaxoSmithKline Biologiclas SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sustained control of group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections in settings of poverty has proven to be challenging, and an effective vaccine may be the most practical long-term strategy to reduce GAS-related disease burden. Candidate GAS vaccines based on the J8 peptide have demonstrated promising immunogenicity in mice, however, less is known about the role of J8 antibodies in the human immune response to GAS infection. We analysed the stimulation of J8 antibodies in response to infection, and the role of existing J8 antibodies in protection against subsequent infection, using data collected in the Fijian population: (1) cross sectional population serosurvey; (2) paired serum collection for assessment of M-specific and J8 antibody responses; and (3) longitudinal assessment of GAS infection and immunity. Median J8 antibody concentrations peaked in the 5-14 year age group, but there was no sustained increase with age. J8 antibody concentration was neither a significant predictor of time to next infection, nor did it show any relationship to the time since last recorded skin infection. Similarly, J8 antibody fold changes over a defined period were associated neither with the time since last skin infection, nor the number of intervening skin infections. While strong M-specific antibody responses were observed for skin infection, similarly strong J8 antibody responses were not observed. There is no indication that antibodies to the J8 antigen would be useful as either a marker of GAS infection or a measure of population immunity, with J8 antibody responses to infection fleeting, if existent at all.

   Methods: Online media articles on maternal vaccination (published July-December 2012 or November 2015-April 2016) were identified through the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine's Vaccine Confidence Database and thematically analysed. Questionnaires for pregnant women and HCPs were distributed within four English hospitals (July 2017-January 2018).
   Results: Of 203 articles identified, 60% related to pertussis vaccination, 33% to influenza and 6% both. The majority positively portrayed vaccination in pregnancy (97%), but inaccurate, negative articles persist which criticize pertussis vaccination's safety and efficacy. Positively-worded articles about pertussis tended to focus on infant protection and highlight examples of recent cases, whereas positively-worded articles about influenza focused on maternal protection. These themes were reflected in questionnaire responses from 314 pregnant women and 204 HCPs, who perceived pertussis vaccination as protecting the baby, and influenza vaccination as protecting the mother, or mother and baby equally. A minority of the pregnant women surveyed intended to decline influenza (22%) or pertussis (8%) vaccination.
   Conclusions: The majority of online articles support pertussis and influenza vaccination during pregnancy. The portrayal of pertussis vaccination as primarily benefiting the child, using real-examples, may influence its higher uptake compared with influenza. This approach should be considered by HCPs when recommending vaccination. HCPs should be prepared to provide advice to women hesitant about vaccination, including addressing any negative media, and consider educational strategies to counteract inaccurate information. Future studies should directly assess the influence of media on vaccine decision-making and establish which media platforms are typically used by pregnant women to gather information.

AB The CD8(+) T-cell response is an essential part of the adaptive immunity. Adjuvants are routinely required for priming of T cells against antigens encountered in lymph nodes (LNs) to generate antigen-specific immunity but may concomitantly trigger unexpected inflammatory responses. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) induces transient desensitization of S1P receptors on LN T cells and temporarily blocks their egress, leading to prolonged intranodal retention that allows effective immunosurveillance and increases the chance of priming. In light of the regulatory role of S1P in T-cell migration, we here develop a strategic approach to the T-cell priming with protein vaccine containing low-dose TLR-based adjuvants (LDAV) to induce antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell responses as efficiently as using regular dose adjuvants in vaccine (RDAV). We found that when combined with one low dose of the S1P analog fingolimod administered into the same vaccination site posteriorly at a specific time, LDAV can elicit a primary response that reaches the level of that induced by RDAV with respect to the response magnitude and functionality. Time-course studies indicate that LDAV and fingolimod in combination act to mimic the expansion kinetics of RDAV-primed antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. Further, intranodal accumulation of cDC1 is markedly enhanced in mice receiving the combination vaccination despite the decrease in adjuvant use. Of particular note is the marginal cutaneous inflammation at the injection site, indicating an added benefit of using fingolimod. Therefore, fingolimod as a nonadjuvant agent essentially facilitates antigen-specific T-cell priming with reduced need of adjuvants and minimized adverse reactions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

   standard; Standardisation; Collaborative study
AB Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), a leading cause of lower respiratory tract illness, has been a focus of vaccine development efforts in recent years. RSV neutralisation assays are particularly useful in the evaluation of immunogenicity of RSV vaccine candidates. Here we report a collaborative study that was conducted with the aim to establish the 1st International Standard for antiserum to RSV, to enable the standardisation of results across multiple assay formats. Two candidate standards were produced from serum samples donated by healthy adult individuals. 25 laboratories from 12 countries, including university laboratories, manufacturers/developers of RSV vaccines and public health laboratories, participated in the study. The study samples comprised the two candidate standards, NIBSC codes 16/284 and 16/322, naturally infected adult sera, age stratified naturally infected paediatric sera, sera from RSV vaccine clinical trials in maternal and elderly subjects, a monoclonal antibody to RSV (palivizumab), two cotton rat serum samples and samples from the BEI Resources panel of human antiserum and immune globulin to RSV.
   The collaborative study showed that between-laboratory variability in neutralisation titres was substantially reduced when values were expressed relative to those of either of the two candidate international standards. Stability of 16/284 and 16/322 maintained for 6 months at different temperatures showed no significant loss of activity (relative to that at -20 degrees C storage temperature) at temperatures of up to +20 degrees C. Based on these results, 16/284 was established as the 1st International Standard for antiserum to RSV, with an assigned unitage of 1000 International Units (IU) of anti-RSV neutralising antibodies per vial, by the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardisation, with 16/322 suitable as a possible replacement standard for 16/284.

AB The integrity of functional epitopes is a critical quality attribute for recombinant protein based vaccines since the presence of these native-like epitopes is the structural basis for vaccines to elicit functional antibodies. To demonstrate the quality and quantity of functional epitopes on vaccine antigens, a toolbox of assessing antigen characteristics is essential. Among the physicochemical, biophysical, immunochemical and in vivo potency analyses, the epitope-specific assays are most critical assessment of the antigen functionality. In this study, we used hepatitis E virus vaccine as an example to illustrated how the monoclonal antibody (mAb) based immunochemical assays were established for in-depth and multifaceted antigen characterization. A large panel of mAbs were developed and characterized using epitope clustering analysis. A subset of these mAbs recognizing non-overlapping epitopes were chosen to be used for assay development. Orthogonal methods, including surface plasma resonance-based BIAcore, solution competitive ELISA and sandwich ELISA, were developed for the antigenicity assessment. The sandwich ELISA with a pair of mAbs, recognizing two different epitopes, was used to assess the accelerated antigen stability, showing enhanced stability with adjuvant adsorption. Such a sandwich ELISA with robust performance has the potentials to be used for in vitro potency analysis to replace animal-based potency assay as product release test. In summary, using hepatitis E vaccine as an example, we demonstrated the importance and establishment of a mAb-based immunochemical toolbox for multifaceted antigen characterization. This is particularly important to demonstrate the successful reconstruction of the native-like and functional epitopes on a recombinant antigen post expression and purification. These epitope-specific and multifaceted assays serve as critical tools for process monitoring or lot consistency tests in support of vaccine development and manufacturing. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: The number of notified cases of Tick-Borne Encephalitis (TBE) in Sweden has been increasing the past years despite the increased use of TBE-vaccine not subsidized by the healthcare system. Stockholm County is a high endemic area and an earlier study has shown that low-income households have lower vaccination coverage even when they are at high risk. This paper aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of a publicly funded TBE vaccination program in Stockholm.
   Methods: In three different cohorts with individuals aged 3, 40 or 50 years, long-term costs and health outcomes of an out-of-pocket strategy (53% of the cohort is vaccinated on their own expenses) and a structured vaccination program (full cohort is vaccinated covered by the publicly funded health care system), were estimated using a Markov model. The Markov model predicts the costs and effects in term of Quality-adjusted Life Years (QALYs) over a lifetime horizon using a third-party healthcare payer perspective. The primary results are presented as an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) indicating the additional cost required to achieve one additional QALY with the structured vaccination program.
   Results: The results show that the structured vaccination program is associated with a gain in QALYs and increased costs compared with an out-of-pocket strategy. The calculated ICERs were 27 761, 99 527 and 160 827 SEK/QALY in cohorts of age 3, 40 and 50, respectively. The sensitivity analyses showed that the results are robust when varying different parameters.
   Conclusion: Given the setting of Stockholm county, this analysis shows a cost per QALY of a free vaccinations program, especially for children of 3 years old, below generally acceptable cost-effectiveness thresholds in Sweden. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The relations between vaccine hesitancy (VH) and individual socioeconomic status (SES) vary with context and remain poorly understood. We examined associations between parental SES and VH levels and their potential mediation by two attitudinal factors: commitment to making "good" health-related decisions and trust in mainstream medicine.
   Methods: Data come from the 2016 Barometre sante, a random cross-sectional telephone survey of the French general population. We analyzed a sample comprising 3927 parents of children aged 1-15 years, dividing them into 4 categories according to their VH level. We performed bivariate and then multiple multinomial logistic regression analyses to study associations between parental educational level, income, and VH. We then reassessed the logistic model with a causal steps approach, adding the commitment and trust scores.
   Results: Vaccine refusers accounted for 26% of parents (95% CI = 25%, 28%), delayers 7% (95% CI = 6%, 8%), and acceptors with doubts 13% (95% CI = 12%, 14%). In bivariate analyses, educational level was associated with VH but income was not, while commitment and trust scores varied significantly with both VH and educational level (p < 0.001). In multivariate analyses, highly educated parents were more prone to be delayers (AOR (>= Bac + 4 versus < Bac) = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.12, 2.69) or refusers (AOR (>= Bac + 4 versus < Bac) = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.19, 2.04) than nonhesitant. These associations did not remain significant after inclusion of the commitment and trust scores in the model.
   Conclusions: Vaccine refusal and delay are frequent among French parents, especially the more educated. Our results suggest that levels of commitment and trust play a key role in shaping VH. Suitable educational interventions are needed to restore trust in authorities and vaccines. Helping healthcare professionals to communicate better with vaccine-hesitant parents is also essential.

AB Introduction: The Global Vaccine Action Plan and the Regional Immunization Action Plan of the Americas call for countries to improve immunization data quality. Immunization information systems, particularly electronic immunization registries (EIRs), can help to facilitate program management and increase coverage. However, little is known about efforts to develop and implement such systems in low- and middle-income countries. We present the experiences of Mexico and Peru in implementing EIRs.
   Methods: We conducted case studies of an EIR in Mexico and of a population registry in Peru. Information was gathered from technical documents, stakeholder focus groups, site visits, and semi-structured interviews of national stakeholders. We organized findings into narratives that emphasized challenges and lessons learned.
   Results: Mexico built one of the world's first EIRs, incorporating novel features such as local-level tracking of patients; however, insufficient resources and poor data registration practices led to the system's discontinuation. Peru created an information system to improve affiliation to social programs, including the immunization program and quality of demographic data. Mexico's experience highlights lessons in failed sustainability of an EIR and a laudable effort to reform a country's information system. Peru's demonstrates that attempts to improve health and other data may strengthen health systems, including immunization data. Major challenges in information system implementation and sustainability in Peru and Mexico related to funding, clear governance structures, and resistance among health workers.
   Discussion: These case studies reinforce the need for countries to ensure adequate funding, plans for sustainability, and health worker capacity-building activities before implementing EIRs. They also suggest new approaches to implementation, including economic incentives for sub-national administrative levels and opportunities to link efforts to improve immunization data with other health and political priorities. More information on best practices is needed to ensure the successful adoption and sustainability of immunization registries in low- and middle-income countries. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Background: Low human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates early after introduction, particularly among low income and minority adolescents, may have resulted in disparities in vaccine-type HPV prevalence (types 6, 11, 16, 18). The purpose of this study was to examine racial/ethnic variations in HPV prevalence, and evaluate how HPV vaccination has affected vaccine-type HPV prevalence across time.
   Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis of 6 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data (2003-2014). Results on HPV status from vaginal samples of 14-26 year old females who responded about HPV vaccination were used to determine HPV prevalence. Prevaccine HPV prevalence was compared to post-licensure prevalence. Racial/ethnic comparisons were made across time, and models were developed to examine the role of HPV vaccination in observed variations for vaccine-type HPV prevalence.
   Results: Among 4080 females, 29.7% were black, 25.6% were Mexican American, 8.9% were Hispanic, and 35.8% were white. Compared to prevaccine years (2003-2006), vaccine-type HPV did not decrease until late post-licensure years (2011-2014; 14.2% vs. 5.2%, p < 0.001). Most of the decrease occurred among white females between prevaccine and late post-licensure periods (15.2% vs. 4.1%, p <0.001). Although a decrease in prevalence was observed among black females during the same periods (16.9% vs. 9.8%, p < 0.05), it was not as large as among white females. Prevalence decreased among Mexican Americans (8.2 vs. 4.0, p > 0.05) during the same periods, but the difference was not significant. Interactions between race and time were significant (p < 0.001), with uneven vaccination between black and white females contributing to the disparities observed.
   Conclusions: HPV vaccination was low in among black and Mexican American females, which contributed to disparities in HPV prevalence. Increasing vaccination among all adolescents, particularly 11-12 year olds, is important because most children this age will not have been exposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vaccines formulated with adjuvant have been effective against numerous infectious diseases, almost always due to induction of functional antibodies that recognizes the pathogen of interest. There is an unmet clinical need for vaccine adjuvants that induce T cells responses to potentially enhance protection against malignancies and intracellular pathogens, where a humoral response, alone, may not be adequate for protection. In this study, we demonstrate that a TLR2 ligand-based adjuvant, meningococcal PorB, has broad immunostimulatory activity with the ability to induce a robust and diverse vaccine antigen specific T cell response. We demonstrate that a vaccine formulated with PorB admixed with ovalbumin induces a wide variety of antigen specific antibody subclasses and effector molecules (MIG, MCP-1, IP-10, MIP-1 alpha, KC & IL-2) with known roles for inducing T cell responses, along with elevated levels of Th1 and Th2 type cytokines upon antigen stimulation. We confirmed production of these cytokines by examining the antigen-specific T cells induced by PorB in vivo. After two immunizations with vaccine formulated with PorB/OVA, antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells were significantly increased in numbers and produced IL-4 or IFN-gamma upon ex vivo antigen re-stimulation. Finally, in a Listeria mouse infection model, vaccine formulated with PorB significantly reduced the bacterial burden upon a low dose infection and increased survival upon a high dose infection with recombinant Listeria monocytogenes engineered to express OVA (rLmOVA), a pathogen that requires OVA-antigen specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells for clearance. In summary, PorB is able to induce antigen specific broad B and T cell responses, illustrating its potential as a potent and new vaccine adjuvant. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To date, inducing the production of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV-1 in humans has been unsuccessful. Several studies have explored the coevolution of HIV-1 and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), but little is known about what affects the lack of bnAbs after long-term infection. A better understanding of the coevolution of the virus and nAbs in cases involving no bnAb production will help in the design of an effective HIV-1 vaccine. An individual with acute CRFOl_AE HIV-1 infection who lacked bnAbs at just over 2 years post-infection (p.i.) was identified from a cohort of HIV negative men who have sex with men. The coevolution of the viral envelope gene and nAbs was studied over 741 days p.i. Strain-specific antibodies (ss-Abs) to the transmitted/founder (T/F) virus developed within 54 days p.i., but plasma collected at subsequent time points could not neutralize synchronous viruses until 557 days p.i., when the plasma acquired low-level synchronous but not heterologous neutralizing activity. The V4 region of envelope gene mutated firstly and continually evolve up to 2 years p.i. Multiple variations in the V4 region, including substitutions, deletions and glycosylation mutations, were driven by ss-Abs and mediated immune escape partially by impacting the binding of nAbs to the virus. The remarkable variations in the V4 region mediated immune escape from ss-Abs and contributed to the affinity maturation of ss-Abs against the T/F virus but may not promote the development of bnAbs. Thus, the V4 region might not be a good target for an HIV-1 vaccine. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Bovine herpesvirus 5 (BoHV-5) is responsible for outbreaks of meningoencephalitis that cause important economic losses in young cattle. BoHV-5 glycoprotein D (gD5) is essential for attachment and penetration into permissive cells and targeting of host immune systems, inducing strong humoral and cellular immune responses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the vaccinal immune response of vaccines formulated with the recombinant BoHV-5 gD (rgD5) in bovines. For the experiment, 72 heifers were randomly allotted into 6 different groups with 12 animals each. Group 1: vaccine formulated using inactivated BoHV-5 (iBoHV-5) adjuvanted with ISA50V2; Group 2: iBoHV-5 associated with 100 mu g of rgD5 adjuvanted with ISA50V2; Group 3: 100 mu g of rgD5 adjuvanted with ISA50V2; Group 4: 100 mu g of rgD5 adjuvanted with Al(OH)(3) ; Group 5: commercial vaccine; and Group 6: control group. Two doses were administered in a 26-day interval and the third after 357 days from primo vaccination. Cattle vaccinated with the vaccines formulated with iBoHV-5 plus rgD5 showed a significant (p < 0.01) five-fold increase in total immunoglobulin G (IgG) for BoHV-5, BoHV-1, and rgD5 as compared with the commercial and control groups. Also, a significant (p < 0.05) increase in IgG1 and IgG2a levels was induced in serum for rgD5. In addition, these same vaccines showed significant (p < 0.01) four-fold higher titers of BoHV-1 and -5 neutralizing antibodies. The results demonstrated that the rgD5 conserved important epitopes that were able to stimulate bovine humoral immunity response capable of viral neutralization of BoHV-1 and -5, suggesting it as a promising vaccine antigen to be used in vaccine for BoHV-1 and -5 endemic areas.

AB Live attenuated vaccines are superior to the killed or subunit vaccines. We designed a Salmonella Typhimurium strain by deleting folD gene (encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenasecy-clohydrolase) in the presence of a heterologous fhu gene (encoding formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase) and tested its vaccine potential under stringent conditions of lethal and sub-lethal challenges with virulent Salmonella in the murine model. The efficacy of the vaccine in conferring protection against Salmonella infection was determined in a wide range of host conditions of systemic infection, corresponding to human young adults, neonates, geriatric age and, importantly, to the immune compromised state of pregnancy. The standardized vaccination regime comprised a primary dose of 10(4) CFU/animal followed by a booster dose of 10(2) CFU/animal on day 7. Challenge with the virulent pathogen was done at day 7 post-administration of the booster. Subsequently, the mortality, morbidity, systemic colonization, antibody response and cytokine profiling were determined. The vaccinated cohort showed a strong protection against virulent pathogen in all models tested. The serum anti-Salmonella antibody titers and cytokine levels were significantly higher in the vaccinated cohort compared to the mock vaccinated cohort. Thus, we report the development and validation of a live attenuated vaccine candidate conferring excellent protection against Salmonellosis and typhoid fever. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A dengue vaccine capable of rapidly eliciting a robust and balanced immunity against the four virus serotypes after only a few immunizations is greatly needed. We describe a new strategy to develop dengue vaccines based on the assembly of virus-like particles (VLPs) utilizing the structural proteins CprME together with a modified complex of the NS2B/NS3 protease, which enhances particle formation and yield. These VLPs are produced in mammalian cells and resemble native dengue virus as demonstrated by negative staining and immunogold labelling electron microscopy (EM). We found that VLPs produced at lower temperature (31 degrees C) were recognized by conformational monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 4G2, 3H5 and C10 whereas VLPs produced at higher temperature (37 degrees C) were not recognized by these MAbs. To investigate the significance of these conformational discrepancies in vaccine performance, we tested the immunogenicity of VLP vaccines produced at 31 degrees C or 37 degrees C. Mice immunized with the VLP vaccine produced at 31 degrees C (VLP-31 degrees C) elicited the highest titer of neutralizing antibodies when compared to those elicited by equivalent doses of the vaccine produced at 37 degrees C (VLP-37 degrees C), inactivated dengue virus vaccine or to the titer of a human anti-dengue-2 convalescence serum reference. Our results demonstrate that the conformation of the E protein displayed on the VLP vaccine plays a critical role in the induction of highly neutralizing antibodies. These findings will guide development of a tetravalent vaccine capable of eliciting a robust and balanced neutralizing response against the four-dengue serotypes regardless of background immunity.

TI Accelerated onset of chronic wasting disease in elk (Cervus canadensis)
   vaccinated with a PrPSc-specific vaccine and housed in a prion
   contaminated environment

ID WHITE-TAILED DEER
AB Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal prion disease affecting multiple cervid species. Effective management tools for this disease, particularly in free-ranging populations, are currently limited. We evaluated a novel CWD vaccine in elk (Cervus canadensis) naturally exposed to CWD through a prion-contaminated environment. The vaccine targets a YYR disease-specific epitope to induce antibody responses specific to the misfolded (PrPSc) conformation. Female elk calves (n = 41) were captured from western Wyoming and transported to the Thorne-Williams Wildlife Research Center where CWD has been documented since 1979. Elk were held in contaminated pens for 14 to 20 days before being alternately assigned to either a vaccine (n = 21) or control group (n = 20). Vaccinated animals initially received two vaccinations approximately 42 days apart and annual vaccinations thereafter. Vaccination induced elevated YYR-specific antibody titers in all animals. Elk were genotyped for the prion protein gene at codon 132, monitored for clinical signs of CWD through daily observation, for disease status through periodic biopsy of rrectoanal mucosa-associated lympoid tissue (RAMALT), and monitored for YYR-specific serum antibody titres. Mean survival of vaccinated elk with the 132MM genotype (n =15) was significantly shorter (800 days) than unvaccinated elk (n = 13) of the same genotype (1062 days; p = 0.003). Mean days until positive RAMALT biopsy for 132MM vaccinated elk (6 7 8) were significantly shorter than unvaccinated 132MM elk (990; p = 0.012). There was, however, no significant difference in survival between vaccinated (n = 4) and control (n = 5) elk with the 132ML genotype (p = 0.35) or in timing of positive RAMALT biopsies of 132ML elk (p = 0.66). There was no strong (p = 0.17) correlation between YYR-specific antibody titers and survival time. Determining the mechanism by which this vaccine accelerates onset of CWD will be important to direct further CWD vaccine research. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: We studied the impact of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) on the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and serotype distribution in a region with intermediate levels of vaccination (around 64% in children aged <2 years).
   Methods: Surveillance data on IPD cases reported by microbiologists participating in the Microbiological Reporting System of Catalonia during 2006-2014 were analysed. We compared estimated incidence rate (IR) ratios for serotypes included in PCV7, PCV10non7, PCV13non10 and non-PCV13 between the PCV7 (2006-2009) and PCV13 periods (2010-2014). IR were corrected for missing serotypes according to year and age groups: <2 years, 2-4 years, 5-64 years and >= 65 years.
   Results: A total of 9338 IPD cases were reported. Overall IPD incidence declined by 26.2% (from 16.4 to 12.1) in the PCV13 period. The largest decrease was observed in children aged 2-4 years (44.5%, from 37.4 to 20.8). Pneumonia fell in all age groups with the largest reduction in children aged 2-4 years (49.3%) and <2 years (42%). PCV13 serotypes decreased significantly in all age groups, from 52% (31.6 to 15.1) in children aged 2-4 years to 35% (22.8 to 14.8) in adults aged >= 65 years. Non-PCV13 serotypes rose by 13% (14.8 to 16.8) in people aged >= 65 years.
   Conclusions: In a region with intermediate vaccination coverage, the introduction of PCV13 has reduced the overall incidence of IPD, mainly due to the decrease in PCV13 serotypes in all age groups, suggesting herd immunity. Non-PCV13 serotypes have increased in adults aged >65 years, suggesting serotype replacement. Higher PCV13 vaccination coverage in children will further reduce IPD incidence in all age groups.

AB There has been increasing attention to financial conflicts of interest (COI) in public health research and policy making, with concerns that some decisions are not in the public interest. One notable problematic area is expert advisory committee (EAC). While COI management has focused on disclosure, it could go further and assess experts' degree of (in)dependence with commercial interests. We analyzed COI disclosures of members of Quebec's immunization EAC (in Canada) using (In)DepScale, a tool we developed for assessing experts' level of (in)dependence. We found great variability of independence with industry and that companies with the highest vaccine sales were predominantly associated with disclosed COIs. We argue that EACs can use the (In)DepScale to better assess and disclose the COIs that affect their experts. Going forward our scale could help manage risk and select members who are less conflicted to foster a culture of transparency and trust in advisors and policy-makers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices recommends that all pregnant women receive the seasonal influenza vaccine and the tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine during every pregnancy. However, vaccination coverage rates are suboptimal among pregnant women in the United States, leaving these women and their unborn children at risk of vaccine-preventable diseases and their complications.
   Objectives: We sought to understand the current landscape of published literature regarding maternal immunization, including barriers to and predictors of vaccine acceptance, and identify gaps in the research in order to inform strategies for future programmatic improvement.
   Methods: We conducted a literature search using MEDLINE (OVID), PsychINFO, and CINAHL (Ebsco) databases. The search included published, English -language manuscripts that identified patient, provider, or system-level barriers to, predictors of, or interventions that improved uptake of maternal vaccines among pregnant women in the US. Studies were reviewed using an inductive thematic analysis approach.
   Results: We included 75 studies in our review. Pregnant women identified 25 different barriers to accepting recommended maternal immunizations; barriers related to vaccine safety perceptions were the most common. Healthcare providers identified 24 different barriers to vaccinating their pregnant patients. The most commonly cited barriers among healthcare providers were financial concerns. Eighteen different predictors of vaccine acceptance were identified. Receipt of a healthcare provider's recommendation was the factor most frequently reported as a reason for vaccination among pregnant women.
   Conclusions: We were able to identify gaps in the literature regarding maternal immunization and make recommendations for future research. Efforts to address the challenges of maternal immunization in the United States should include increasing the focus on Tdap, implementing more high-level assessments of safety perceptions and associated concerns, and determining most effective interventions.

AB The global reduction in childhood infectious diseases since the 1960s is primarily due to the success of extensive worldwide immunisation campaigns. However, the universal vaccination coverage program appears to have lost momentum in the wake of negative, unfounded claims about the safety of vaccines. While parents of the 21st century have little first-hand knowledge of devastating childhood diseases, grandparents are more likely to remember family and community members who were afflicted. In the current age of vaccine hesitancy and science scepticism, where research-informed arguments are not always persuasive, grandparents, through their experience of the diseases, may positively influence paediatric vaccine uptake. This paper reviews the literature investigating potential direct or indirect influences of grandparents on parents' decisions to vaccinate their children. A database search using the keywords immunisation, vaccination, children and grandparents resulted in 1988 articles. Titles were screened for relevance and seventy-seven results were retained. After the abstracts were read, only five articles that either explored paediatric vaccines, factors promoting and/or inhibiting paediatric vaccine use and decision-making strategies were reviewed. One paper located through Google Scholar, which failed to show up on database searches, was also retained for a total of six papers. While none of the six papers set out to explore the impact of grandparents on vaccine uptake, they found that grandparents were involved to varying degrees in paediatric vaccine uptake within young families. The research clearly showing that grandparents, and older people more generally, promote vaccination uptake is not currently available. The dearth of literature shows the need for research exploring the perceived and real influences of grandparents on childhood vaccination. This will establish whether grandparents' memory and knowledge of preventable childhood infectious diseases could be harnessed as a public health measure to counteract the current, ill-informed, negative attention on paediatric vaccines.

AB Malaria transmission-blocking vaccines aim to inhibit the development of malaria parasites in mosquitoes by inducing antibodies targeting surface proteins of sexual stage parasites. We have recently identified PyMiGS, a protein specifically expressed in the osmiophilic body of male gametocytes of Plasmodium yoelii (Py). PyMiGS is translocated to the surface of microgametes, and potent transmission-blocking activity was observed in mosquitoes fed on mice passively immunized with antibodies against PyMiGS. Here we demonstrate using a direct feeding assay that recombinant PyMiGS successfully induces anti-PyMiGS antibodies in mice and that the antibodies block parasite development in mosquitoes. We also show using the membrane-feeding assay that rabbit anti-PyMiGS antibody inhibits parasite development in mosquitoes in a dose-dependent manner without complement involvement. To investigate the mode of action of anti-PyMiGS antibodies against parasite development, we observed exflagellation after mixing Py gametocytes with activation medium containing anti-PyMiGS or anti-GST control antibodies. Whereas most microgametes were released from activated male gametocytes in the control group, a significantly reduced number of microgametes were released in the anti-PyMiGS group, with most of the microgametes left attached to the activated male gametocytes. Moreover, anti-PyMiGS antibodies shortened the duration of the active movement of microgametes after the onset of exflagellation. Taken together, these findings suggest that anti-PyMiGS antibodies bind to the microgamete surface immediately after exflagellation, thereby reducing microgamete motility and inhibiting microgamete release from the activated male gametocytes. These results strongly suggest that PyMiGS orthologues in Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax can be promising TBV candidates. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: Diarrhea is a leading cause of mortality worldwide and rotavirus accounts for many of these deaths. As of August 2018, 96 countries have introduced rotavirus vaccines into their immunization programs. Two rotavirus vaccines, Rotarix (R) and RotaTeq (R), have been WHO-prequalified since 2009, with Rotarix (R) being the preferred product of most Gavi-supported countries. ROTAVAC (R) and ROTASIIL (R) have both been prequalified recently.
   Materials and methods: We reevaluated the costs and cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination in Bangladesh, Ghana, and Malawi and compared Rotarix (R), ROTAVAC (R), and ROTASIIL (R) in each country. For consistency with previously published analyses in these countries, we used the same Excel-based cohort model and much of the same data as the original analyses. We varied the expected price (with and without Gavi subsidy), wastage, and incremental health system costs associated with each vaccine. We assumed the same efficacy and waning assumptions following administration of two or three doses for the respective product.
   Results: The discounted cost per DALY averted compared to no vaccination ranged from 0.3 to 1.3 times GNI per capita for each vaccine. With the Gavi subsidy, the average cost-effectiveness ratios were below 0.3 times GNI per capita in all three countries. Though critical empirical cost data are not yet available, Rotarix (R) is the least costly and most cost-effective product in the countries examined in this modelling study. However, small decreases in the incremental health system cost for other products could result in cost and cost-effectiveness outcomes that match or surpass those of Rotarix (R).
   Conclusion: Countries may wish to consider new rotavirus vaccines entering the market. Countries should carefully examine multiple product attributes including price and the incremental health system costs associated with each vaccine. These costs will vary by country and may be a defining factor in determining the least costly and most cost-effective product for the population. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: We analyzed outpatient visits, incidence, antimicrobial prescriptions, and medical expenditures for acute otitis media (AOM) in the United States during 2011-2016.
   Methods: Data sources included the National Disease and Therapeutic Index (NDTP (TM)) projections by IQVIA (for AOM cases), The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (for medical expenditures) and the US Census (for population estimates). Analyses focused on children aged <= 9 years between 2011 and 2016. We used the 2014 medical expenditure estimate per otitis media episode ($520) as proxy for all years.
   Results: In 2011, there were an estimated 11.5 million AOM episodes in children aged 0-9 years in the US with AOM incidence rates (IR) of 476, 204, and 284 episodes per 1000 children aged 0-2, 3-9, and 0-9 years, respectively. All subsequent years had lower IRs, and by 2016, IR was 25.1% lower than in 2011 in children 0-9 years. In addition, there were estimates of 10.8 million and 9.2 million fewer cumulative AOM episodes and antimicrobial prescriptions for AOM nationwide between 2012 and 2016, compared to annual 2011 estimates, representing a similar to$5.6 billion decrease in direct medical expenditures. The average number of antibiotic prescriptions per AOM visit remained stable with 0.89 and 0.86 prescriptions per visit in 2011 and 2016, respectively.
   Conclusions: AOM incidence, antimicrobial prescriptions, and associated medical expenses decreased substantially between 2011 and 2016 in the United States. Antimicrobial prescribing practices remain unchanged. Additional studies are warranted to assess causality. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Efforts driving universal coverage have recently been strengthened through implementation of the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) where cost estimates for immunization support were developed totaling US $40 billion of donor assistance by 2020.In addition to resource mobilization, there has been an increasing focus on improving both vaccine access and delivery systems. We track donor assistance for immunization by funding objective and channel from 1990 to 2016, and illustrate projections through 2020 to inform progress of the GVAP.
   Using available data from development agencies supporting immunization, we categorize funding by vaccine and quantify support for systems strengthening. We split time into four periods including the post universal childhood immunization era (1990-1999) and Gavi's three funding phases between 2000 and 2015, during which annualized funding changes are estimated. Lastly, we perform a linear extrapolation through 2020 to predict the success of stipulated resource mobilization targets. Double counting was eliminated and results presented in real 2017 US dollars.
   Over the last 27 years, funding for immunization increased by 10.5% annually, with non-Gavi funding increasing by 7.1% and Gavi funding by 23.6% in the last 17 years. Gavi disbursements targeting vaccines and health system improvements increased uniformly at 15%, compared to 22.5% for vaccines and 11.7% for system strengthening from non-Gavi channels. Funding fluctuated for non-Gavi channels with disbursements declining before 2000 and during Gavi funding phase II, while Gavi disbursements continued to grow relative the previous phase. New and underused vaccines were prioritized by Gavi whereas non-Gavi channels focused on elimination efforts. Projected funding targets were estimated to be on track for Gavi contrary to non-Gavi support which was estimated to remain 40% below the stipulated target.
   Renewed assessments for funding requirements need to be undertaken, while strengthening existing resource efficiencies in order to achieve current global universal coverage targets. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Disruption of one or more components of the Tol-Pal system, involved in maintaining the integrity of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, has been proposed as a method to increase the yield obtained from natural production of outer membrane vesicles (OMV). We present a new OMV-based product, obtained from genetically modified Shigella flexneri 2a with a non-polar deletion in tolR and heat-inactivated (HT-Delta tolR). The S. flexneri Delta tolR strain lead to a higher release of vesicles, more than 8-times when compared to the yield obtained from chemically inactivated wild type strain. S. flexneri mutant strain appeared to be more sensitive to different chemical compounds, including antibiotics, bile salts or human complement and it was also less virulent in both in vitro and in vivo assays. The mutation produced some changes in the LPS O-chain and protein expression. S. flexneri Delta tolR was enriched in long and very long LPS O-chain and expressed a different pattern of surface proteins or lipoproteins. In vitro toxicity and activation properties were determined in Raw 267.4 macrophage cell line. HT-Delta tolR antigenic complex was non-cytotoxic and activation markers, such as MHC-II or CD40, were highly expressed during incubation with this product. Finally, preliminary studies on the antibody response elicited by HT-Delta tolR demonstrated a robust and diverse response in mice. Considering these promising results, HT-Delta toIR antigenic extract appears as a new potential vaccine candidate to face shigellosis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) has been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular events in human observational studies. Animal studies suggest that the phosphorylcholine epitope in the Streptococcus pneumoniae cell wall is structurally similar to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), hence PPV induces the production of antibodies that cross-react with anti-oxLDL and may cause regression of atherosclerotic plaque. We set out to determine the strength of association between PPV administration and reduction in cardiovascular events.
   Methods: A longitudinal, population-based cohort study of older Australians, from the Hunter Community Study, with up to 11 years of follow-up. We included participants aged >= 65 years at baseline (2004-2008), without a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD). History of PPV administration at baseline was the main exposure of interest. "Total number of hospital bed-days with CVD primary diagnosis" was one of the main outcomes measured. Models were adjusted for age, diabetes, alcohol intake, and smoking status. Influenza vaccine was the control exposure used and fracture bed-days was the control outcome used, to investigate the potential for residual confounding.
   Results: 91 of the total 1074 participants (mean age = 72, male = 45%) experienced a CVD event during follow-up. PPV (regardless of influenza vaccine) was associated with a significant reduction in CVD bed-day, (n = 863, incident rate ratio, IRR = 0.65, 95%CI: 0.45-0.94, p = 0.02), but influenza vaccine (regardless of PPV) was not (n = 864, IRR = 0.86, 95%CI: 0.54-1.35, p = 0.51). Furthermore, PPV adjusted for influenza vaccine remained associated with CVD bed-days (IRR = 0.64, 95%CI: 0.43-0.96, p = 0.03) but was not associated with fracture bed-days (IRR = 0.75, 95%CI: 0.28-2.00, p = 0.56).
   Conclusion: PPV demonstrated a 35% reduction in CVD bed-days. This finding was robust to residual confounding, using a control exposure and a control outcome, eliminating the concern for healthy-user bias. A large double-blinded placebo-controlled RCT is underway to confirm our finding and to explore the proposed mechanism of action (ACTRN12615000536561). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Parents have varied HPV vaccine communication needs, which presents a challenge for healthcare providers. To improve communication resources for providers, we sought to characterize HPV vaccination messages available in existing educational materials. In fall 2016, we searched PubMed, educational material clearinghouses, and Google for English language HPV vaccination messages. We extracted messages that a provider might use when raising the topic of HPV vaccination, answering common questions, and motivating vaccination. Two reviewers independently coded each message. The search identified 267 unique messages about HPV vaccination. Messages generally were long (mean no. of words = 44, standard deviation [SD] = 33) and required a high level of education to read (mean reading grade level = 10, SD = 3). Only 32% of messages were shorter than 25 words, and 12% had a readability at or below grade 6. Most frequent were messages to address common parent questions or concerns (62%); the most common topics were diseases prevented by HPV vaccine (18%) and safety and side effects (16%). Many messages included information about cancer prevention (26%) and same-day vaccination (13%). Few messages (6%) used a presumptive style to recommend HPV vaccination. In conclusion, available messages about HPV vaccination were markedly varied. We identified few messages that were both brief (to facilitate providers memorizing them) and accessible (to facilitate parents understanding them). Future research should identify which messages lead to HPV vaccine uptake. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID IMMUNIZATION; PERCEPTIONS; VACCINES; IMPACT; WEB
AB The Croatian Immunization Programme is a mandatory prevention programme in which vaccines are offered free of charge and little is known about parental vaccine-related beliefs and attitudes. We aimed to describe beliefs and attitudes towards childhood vaccination of parents in Zagreb, estimate the proportion of parents with positive attitudes towards vaccination, and to identify the possible predictors of positive attitudes. Using a self-administered questionnaire, we performed a cluster sampling survey among parents of 6-years-old children in Zagreb. In total 542 questionnaires were collected, 80% (n = 430/542) of respondents were mothers. Even though 72.6% (n = 385/531; 95%CI: 69-76) respondents feel that child- hood vaccination should remain mandatory, 36.3% (n = 192/528; 95%CI: 58.3-65.3) considered that simultaneous administration of vaccines can have negative effect to their child's health. In addition, 38% (n = 202/532; 95%CI: 33.2-43.1%) feared that vaccines may harm their child. Of total, parents mostly reported positive attitude towards vaccination (61.8%; 95% CI: 34.7-42). Parents with positive attitudes were more likely to state their child experienced mild or no adverse reaction after vaccination, report not delaying vaccination and provide additional non-mandatory vaccines to their child (p < 0.05). Gender, age, education and marital status of parent were not significantly associated with the positive attitude towards vaccination. Our results suggest the need for educational interventions and communication strategies that could foster better knowledge on immunization with a focus on parental misconceptions, perceived constraints and safety issues about vaccine.

AB Background: The objectives of the present cross-sectional study were to investigate the level of knowledge and attitudes regarding Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and its vaccination and to under-stand the impact of different determinants among immigrants and refugees in Italy.
   Methods: Between September 2016 and March 2018, a total of 519 potential participants were randomly recruited. The information was collected through a questionnaire administered by two researchers.
   Results: Only 15.9% reported that they had heard of HPV infection before completing the survey and 83.8% of them were aware that the infection could be transmitted through sexual intercourses, 32.3% that it can lead to cervical cancer, 22% to warts, 16.2% to penile cancer, 13.2% to oral cancer, 39.7% that cervical cancer is a very severe disease, 47.1% that receiving the vaccine could protect against the infection, and 44.1% that a vaccine against HPV is available in Italy. Females, those who originated from Eastern Europe, Asia and South America, those who lived in a house compared to those who lived in a street, and those who had 1-10 years and 11 or more years of education compared to those illiterate were more likely to have heard about the HPV infection before completing the survey. Only 3 participants (0.7%) received the HPV vaccination. Out of the unvaccinated who had heard of HPV, 50.7% and 59% of those between the ages of 12 and 26 and of those who had at least one child aged 12-26 years, were willing to receive vaccination for themselves as well as their children.
   Conclusion: The results underscored the necessity to develop health education and promotion aimed at improving the knowledge and vaccination practice in immigrants and refugees. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Factors influencing the performance of routine immunization in urban

LA English

AB Urban areas are often omitted from investigations on immunization because the published literature tends to focus on rural settings. The two largest cities in Cameroon - Douala and Yaounde - are the main drivers of the high number of unvaccinated children in Cameroon. The objective of our study was to identify the factors influencing vaccine incompleteness in Douala and Yaounde in children (12-23 months of age).
   We conducted a community-based cross-sectional study using concomitant mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative) with an explanatory aim. The study was conducted in three health districts in each city between March and April 2016.
   The number of nonvaccinated and incompletely vaccinated children was higher in Yaounde (3.1% and 40.3%, respectively) than in Douala (0.7% and 10.1%, respectively). The most frequent reason for nonvaccination was related to the parent/guardian not knowing the consequences of not being vaccinated and lack of money. According to the explanatory model, nonvaccination in both cities was associated with the following issues: (1) perceived high visibility of the health district office in terms of vaccination, (2) the shortage of health personnel in immunization centers, (3) attending a private health facility, (4) average or poor behavior of health personnel at immunization centers, and (5) poor knowledge of vaccine-preventable diseases.
   This mixed-methods study illustrates how inadequacies of the health district framework within urban areas are fueling poor performance of routine immunization in Cameroon. Further research should inform the development of community-centered vaccination services that are most needed, especially in rapidly urbanizing sub-Saharan Africa. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Influenza vaccination rates in the U.S. remain low at 41% among adults over 18 years according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2016 data. Reasons for the low rate vary and include factors such as risk perception, vaccine hesitancy, and access to health care. This cross-sectional study sought to examine the relationship between social media use and influenza vaccine uptake among a sample of White and African Americans over 18 years of age. Using bivariate, and unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression tests, this study examined the relationship among social media use, social media as a source of health information, and influenza vaccination status in 2015. Our results indicate that users of Twitter (OR4.41, 95%CI: 1.43-13.60) and Facebook (OR 1.66, 95%CI: 1.01-2.72) as sources of health information were more likely to be vaccinated in comparison to users who do not use Twitter or Facebook as a source of health information. These findings have implications for the potential of using social media platforms to disseminate influenza vaccine information and encourage users to get vaccinated annually. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Persistent Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection is associated with the development of cervical cancer, a leading cause of female death worldwide. In Lebanon, cervical cancer is the 6th most common cancer amongst girls and women aged 14-44 years. Cervical cancer is preventable through HPV vaccination; however, Lebanon does not include HPV vaccination in its national routine vaccination schedule. Hence, physician recommendation is key for patient vaccine uptake. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Beirut, Lebanon to assess factors affecting physician recommendation regarding HPV vaccination. Physicians practicing in Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBGYN), Pediatrics, Family Medicine and Infectious Diseases were included in the study. In total, 228 physicians completed the survey (28.79% response rate). The survey consisted of a set of demographic and HPV knowledge questions along with clinical vignettes. The vignettes presented theoretical patients who differed in gender, age, sexual activity, social background and whether the patient presented with his mother or not. The results show that physicians tend to recommend the vaccine more commonly for vignettes presenting female patients, with an Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) of 6.8. Also, physicians were more likely to recommend the vaccine for vignettes with patients coming from a non-conservative background (AOR = 2.1), vignettes where patients claim to be sexually active (AOR = 2.7) and vignettes where patients presented with their mother (AOR = 1.4). Physicians tend to recommend the vaccine less in vignettes with married patients (AOR = 0.5). Physicians with higher knowledge scores recommended the vaccine more often (AOR = 3.4). Overall, OBGYN physicians recommended the vaccine less than pediatricians (AOR = 0.5). These results show that Lebanese physicians' recommendations rely on factors external to international guidelines. The results also highlight the importance of knowledge in adequate patient consultation. Thus, improved physician awareness towards international guidelines and physician education regarding HPV vaccination is essential in order to improve patient care in Lebanon. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: The acellular pertussis vaccine was introduced into the routine childhood immunization schedule across Canada in 1997-98 and adolescent booster doses were added between 1999 and 2005. We sought to assess the impact of these changes on infant pertussis hospitalizations and admissions to intensive care units (ICU) in Canada.
   Methods: Hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of pertussis were extracted from the Canadian Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) for cases with hospital discharge dates between 1981 and 2016 using relevant ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. Only cases with age less than one year at time of admission were included. Disease severity was assessed by admission to ICU. Cases were categorized into two periods: pre-program implementation period (1981-1995) and the post-program implementation period (2006-2016). Incidence rates, risk ratios, and rate differences were calculated for each period and comparisons for the two periods were done using chi-squared and t-tests. Quasi Poisson analysis was used to investigate trends.
   Results: When comparing the pre- and post-implementation periods, the average annual hospitalization rates for infants less than 1 year declined from 165.1 (95% CI 161.3, 168.9) to 33.6 (95% CI 31.6, 35.6) pertussis-related admissions per 100,000 population, with a corresponding reduction in the risk ratio of 4.9 (95% CI 4.6, 5.2). The risk of admission into an ICU was 1.58 times higher in the pre- versus post-implementation period while the highest reduction in average annual hospitalizations was 263.3 admissions per 100,000 population in infants 2 months of age. In the post-implementation period, infants less than 1 month of age had the highest average annual hospitalization rate at 126.6 (95% CI 113.1, 140.1) hospitalizations per 100,000 infants.
   Conclusion: Infant pertussis hospitalizations have reduced greatly over time. Infants under 2 months of age remain the most at-risk age group for hospitalization and admission to ICU. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: This study investigated the patterns of pneumococcal disease vaccination, the time between two different pneumococcal vaccine doses and factors associated with series completion.
   Methods: A retrospective claims database analysis was conducted using the Clinformatics DataMart (TM) database. Adults who turned 65 years between January 1st, 2013 to June 30th, 2017 and were continuously enrolled (>= 15 months) in the Medicare Advantage plans to June 30th, 2017 were included in this study. Pneumococcal vaccination patterns included: PCV13-PPV23, PPV23-PCV13, or receiving PPV23 or PCV13 only. Pneumococcal vaccination series completion was defined as receiving PCV13-PPV23 or PPV23-PCV13 from 65 years old to June 30th, 2017 while non-completion was defined as receiving only PCV13 or only PPV23 from 65 years old to June 30th, 2017. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with pneumococcal vaccination series completion.
   Results: A total of 224,132 adults were included in this study. Most received no pneumococcal vaccination (49%), while 34.3% received only one vaccine. Series completion occurred in 16.8% of adults. Some adults received only one vaccination: 11.6% received PPV23 and 22.7% received PCV13. The mean time between vaccinations was 420.8 days (approximately 14 months) for the PCV-PPV23 series, and 595.5 days (approximately 20 months) for the PPV23-PCV13 series. Adults were significantly more likely to complete pneumococcal vaccination series if they had at least one doctor's office, outpatient visit, or pharmacy visit versus no visits, or received an influenza vaccination in the first year after turning 65 years than those who did not (All: P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Despite the 2014 recommendation, percentages of pneumococcal vaccination series completion were found to be low, aligning with recent literature. This highlights the need to improve series completion, given the increased risk and associated economic burden of pneumococcal disease in adults aged >= 65 years. (C) 2018 Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.

AB Background: In this cohort study, we examined antibody levels and avidity after a two-dose schedule (0, 6 months) of the bivalent HPV-vaccine in girls routinely vaccinated in the Dutch HPV-vaccination program, up to 2 years following vaccination.
   Methods: A blood sample at 7, 12 and 24 months after the first dose and questionnaire data were collected (n = 56). HPV type-specific antibody concentrations (lU/ml) against seven types (HPV16/18/31/33/45/52/58) were assessed using a validated virus-like particles (VLP) multiplex immunoassay. Avidity was tested using a modification of this assay.
   Results: Seropositivity for vaccine types HPV 16 and 18 was 100% up to month 24, but declined for HPV-types 31/33/45/52/58, although not statistically significant for HPV45. All Geometric Mean Concentrations (GMCs) declined by months 12 and 24, but remained high for HPV16/18. Between month 7 and 12, GMCs declined more for other types. High avidity antibodies were induced up to 24 months for vaccine types (75%, 76-78% and 81-82% at months 7, 12 and 24, respectively), but for other types anti-body avidity was 16-29% at month 7, 20-32% at month 12 and 19-32% at month 24.
   Conclusions: GMCs declined over time for HPV-types 16/18/31/33/45/52/58, but remained high for vaccine-types HPV16/18 up to 24 months of follow-up. Antibody avidity was >75% for vaccine types but <35% for other HPV-types. Further follow-up of this cohort will provide insight into antibody and avidity kinetics over time. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Continuing investments in vaccine innovation are insufficiently translated into market entries of novel vaccines. This innovation paradox is in part caused by stakeholders lacking complete understanding of the complex array of steps necessary for vaccine development and collaboration difficulties between the wide variety of stakeholders involved. Models providing cross-domain understanding can improve collaboration but currently lack both comprehensibility and granularity to enable a prioritized view of activities and criteria.
   Key opinion leaders (KOLs) were asked to contribute to the definition of a vaccine innovation cycle (VIC). In a first step, 18 KOLs were interviewed on the stages (activities and results) and gates (evaluation criteria and outcomes) of vaccine innovation. This first description of the VIC was subsequently validated and refined through a survey among 46 additional KOLs.
   The VIC identifies 29 distinct stages and 28 corresponding gates, distributed in ten different but integrated workstreams, and comprehensibly depicted in a circular innovation model. Some stage-gates occur at defined moments, whereas the occurrence and timing of other stage-gates is contingent on a variety of contextual factors. Yet other stage-gates continuously monitor internal and external developments. A gap-overlap analysis of stage-gate criteria demonstrated that 5 out of 11 criteria employed by vaccine developers correspond with criteria employed by competent (regulatory) authorities.
   The VIC provides a comprehensive overview of stage-gates throughout the value chain of vaccine innovation. Its cyclical nature highlights the importance of synchronizing with unmet needs and market changes, and conceptualizes the difference between incremental and radical vaccine innovation. Knowledge on the gap between internal and external criteria will enhance the viability of newcomers to the field.
   The VIC can be used by stakeholders to improve understanding and communication in forming collaborative alliances and consortia. Such a boundary-spanning function may contribute to the reduction of process inefficiencies, especially in public-private partnerships. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Assessing the operational costs of routine immunization activities at
   the sub-center level in Myanmar: What matters for increasing national
   immunization coverage ?

ID SERVICES; VACCINES
AB Background: Myanmar's national immunization program was launched in 1978. Routine immunization is mainly provided at sub-center level with midwives assigned as main vaccinators. The vaccinators at the sub-centers have to obtain vaccines from their designated township health department's cold room for immunization services. This study aimed to calculate the operational costs of routine immunization at sub-centers in Myanmar.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 160 sub-centers throughout the country. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with the main vaccinator at each sub-center using a pre-tested questionnaire. The study analyzed the operational costs per facility and the associations between sub-center characteristics and operational costs.
   Results: In Myanmar, the average operational costs of routine immunization per sub-center ranged from 434,700-990,125 MMK for rural areas and 235,875-674,250 MMK for urban areas. The operational costs increased by 8,749.50 MMK (95% CI: 6,805.79-10,693.21; p < 0.001) per mile and 5,752.50 MMK (95% CI: 914.22-10,590.79; p < 0.05) per working day.
   Conclusion: This study indicated that the operational costs at sub-centers were high and varied significantly among the different geographical areas. The operational costs could be reduced by additional support for the resources, for example, installing cold chain facilities at sub-centers and opening new sub-centers throughout the country.

AB Gongronella sp. w5 (w5) is a soil fungus isolated from Anhui, China. Here we report the high-quality genome sequence of w5 and its phenotypic characteristics based on genomic information. The genome of w5 consists of 34,723,828 bp assembled into 149 scaffolds and 11,302 predicted protein-coding genes. Genome analysis suggested that w5 may possess host cell infection capacity and maybe a biotrophic fungus that relies on plant sucrose as carbon source. W5 shows the ability of rapid invasion into the plant root cells based on CAZymes analysis. Further results evidenced that w5 can use sucrose as the carbon source. Plant inoculation revealed that w5 penetrates the root cells of Actinidia chinensis with its hypha, and simultaneously promotes plant growth. It may promote plant growth by secreting organic acid and facilitating phosphate acquisition. The new genomic data and phenotype features will facilitate future applications of this strain in biotechnology.

AB Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) plays a major role in amino acid catabolism. To increase the current knowledge of GDH function, we analysed the effect of GDH silencing on liver intermediary metabolism from gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). Sequencing of GDH cDNA from S. aurata revealed high homology with its vertebrate orthologues and allowed us to design short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to knockdown GDH expression. Following validation of shRNA-dependent downregulation of S. aurata GDH in vitro, chitosan-tripolyphosphate (TPP) nanoparticles complexed with a plasmid encoding a selected shRNA (pCpG-sh2GDH) were produced to address the effect of GDH silencing on S. aurata liver metabolism. Seventy-two hours following intraperitoneal administration of chitosan-TPP-pCpG-sh2GDH, GDH mRNA levels and immunodetectable protein decreased in the liver, leading to reduced GDH activity in both oxidative and reductive reactions to about 53-55 % of control values. GDH silencing decreased glutamate, glutamine and aspartate aminotransferase activity, while increased 2-oxoglutarate content, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity and 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase/fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity ratio. Our findings show for the first time that GDH silencing reduces transdeamination and gluconeogenesis in the liver, hindering the use of amino acids as gluconeogenic substrates and enabling protein sparing and metabolisation of dietary carbohydrates, which would reduce environmental impact and production costs of aquaculture.

AB A large number of proteins are expressed in fusion with a tag to perform their purification. Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) is a widely used tag to achieve passenger protein purification. Accordingly, commonly used commercial expression vectors contain the coding sequence of GST in order to express fusion proteins. However, fusion proteins are sometimes expressed in a truncated form that may result from an incomplete synthesis, proteolytic cleavage or the presence of a functional alternative translation initiation site. In particular, a truncated as well as a full-length fusion protein were observed when expressing RGS9-1 Anchor Protein without its C-terminal segment (bR9AP) in fusion with GST. Moreover, this truncated protein was found to be purified together with the full-length fusion protein. Here, we identified for the first time an alternative translation initiation site within the sequence of GST that likely becomes accessible for translation only when it is fused with a passenger protein. Indeed, bioinformatics analyses suggest that the secondary structure of the mRNA of the GST-bR9AP fusion protein is different from that of GST alone, which likely allows accessibility of an alternative Shine-Dalgarno sequence coupled with an additional initiation codon within the sequence of GST. The functionality of this alternative translation initiation site was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis, which resulted in the absence of a truncated fusion protein and, consequently, only a purified full-length fusion protein. This is an extremely important finding in view of the wide use of GST as a purification and solubility-enhancing tag.

AB Cell populations that are exclusively composed by descendants from a defined single parental progenitor are referred to as "monoclonal", "clonal" or more correctly as "clonally derived cell population". Clonal derivation of cell lines used in the manufacturing of recombinant biologics is a regulatory requirement that aims to ensure a robust process and consistent quality throughout the life cycle of a product. Clonal derivation of cell lines is usually ensured by the process (e.g. two subsequent rounds of limiting dilution). Here we present an approach to analytically assess the probability of clonal derivation of existing cell populations. Using target locus amplification (TLA) followed by next generation sequencing (NGS), unique genetic features can be identified, for example the integration site of the plasmid in the host cell genome or plasmid-plasmid junctions of the plasmids used for expression of recombinant biologics. Whereas a direct assessment of clonal derivation using TLA/NGS data is challenging due to limitations in specificity, confirmed clonally derived populations generated from the cell line population can be analyzed by qPCR for the presence of the unique genetic features identified by TLA/NGS. In the present study, a statistical analysis allowed the demonstration that two independently generated CHO cell lines were clonally derived with an upper 95% confidence interval limit of a potentially present contaminating population of 1.3%.

AB High titer, productivity and yield are the main pre-requisites of an efficient lactic acid production process. However, the hyperosmotic stress inhibits cell metabolism in the later phase of fermentation. In this study, an osmotic-tolerant mutant named Lactobacillus paracasei NCBI001-M2 was obtained through a high-throughput screening technology, which exhibited a higher tolerance to osmotic stress due to its more flexible regulation of the unsaturated fatty acid proportion along with the intracellular compatible solute pools. The mutant successfully consumed all 248 g/L initial glucose and produced 223.7 g/L lactic acid with a productivity of 5.53 g/ L/h in a single batch fermentation by the neutralizing agent strategy. Moreover, similar fermentation performances were also achieved in the open fermentation mode without sterilization by the mutant, which suggested that the mutant would be a potential for cost-effective commercial lactic acid production.

AB Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are thermoplastic polyesters produced by a wide range of bacteria as carbon and energy reserves. PHA accumulation is typically increased under unbalanced growth conditions and with carbon source in excess. Although polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) could be used for specific applications, it is brittle and not a useful alternative for plastics like polypropylene. Far more useful polypropylene-like PHAs, are copolymers composed of 3-hydroxybutyrate and 3-hydroxyvalerate, P(3HB-co-3HV). Propionic acid is one of the carbon sources that can be used to generate 3HV. A mutant derived from Herbaspirillum seropedicae Z69, a strain previously described as capable of producing P(3HB-co-3HV) from propionic acid, was constructed to increase 3HV biosynthetic efficiency. The strategy involved elimination of a catabolic route for propionyl-CoA by deficiency marker exchange of a selected gene. The mutant (Z69Prp) was constructed by elimination of the 2-methylcitrate synthase (PrpC) gene of the 2-methylcitrate cycle for propionate catabolism. Strain Z69Prp was unable to grow on sodium propionate, but in cultures with glucose-propionate accumulated 50% of its dry weight as copolymer. Z69Prp had 14.1 mol% 3HV; greater than that of strain Z69 (2.89 mol%). The 3HV yield from propionic acid (Y3HV/prop) was 0.80 g g(-1) and below the maximum theoretical value (1.35 g g (-1)).

TI Staggered Target SELEX, a novel approach to isolate non-cross-reactive
   aptamer for detection of SEA by apta-qPCR

AB Background and objective: Aptamers or chemical antibodies are oligonucleotides (DNA or RNA) that are able to bind to various targets with high specificity and affinity such as toxins which are isolated by an in vitro method known as SELEX. To date, there are many SELEX procedures for the isolation of novel aptamers against proteins. However not all modified SELEX are suitable for similar protein based on sequence homology such as staphylococcal enterotoxins. Staphylococcal enterotoxin type A (SEA) is the most prevalent toxin involved in staphylococcal food poisoning (SFP) worldwide. SEA is homologous to Staphylococcal enterotoxin type D (SED) and Staphylococcal enterotoxin type E (SEE) about 50% and 83%, respectively. Here, we have developed Staggered Target SELEX (ST-SELEX) as a novel designed SELEX procedure to acquire specific non-cross-reactive aptamers against SEA as a model protein.
   Methods: In this study, isolated ssDNA aptamers by ST-SELEX were used for detection of SEA via apta-Real time PCR (apta-qPCR). After in silico analysis of SEA protein with SEE and finding the specific region on the surface of protein, ST-SELEX was carried out in two steps (classical SELEX and Second SELEX). Finally, after isolating high specific aptamers, the apta-qPCR was used for the detection of the SEA. In this technique, poly-clonal antibody against SEA was immobilized on protein G sepharose beads (Ab-PGs). Then, the SEA protein was captured by poly clonal antibody as the target that immobilized on sepharose beads. The isolated aptamers were bound on the surface of SEA protein that captured by Ab-PGs. Finally, the heat-released aptamers were amplified by qPCR.
   Result: Our investigation showed that the aptamers were generated in vitro by a ten-round selection process based on ST-SELEX procedure with dissociation constant (K-D) value 7.44 +/- 0.6 nM and limit of detection (LOD) of 146.67 fM.
   Discussion and conclusion: The advantage of ST-SELEX compared to other SELEX methods was to select a specific non cross-reactive aptamer against two or more proteins with high sequence homology. These aptamers can be used in sensitive detection methods such as apta-qPCR.

AB Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) derived cell lines are the preferred host system for the production of therapeutic proteins. The aim of this work was to explore the regulation of suspension-adapted CHO-K1 host cell line bio-processes, especially under a temperature gradient from 37 degrees C to 31 degrees C. We analyzed cell cycle behavior through flow cytometry of propidium iodide stained cells and high throughput transcriptome dynamics by RNA sequencing.
   We found a cell culture state characterized by G0/G1 synchronization, mainly during the late exponential growth phase and towards the last days of the stationary phase. We successfully identified key genes and pathways connected with the particular culture states, such as response to low temperature, modulation of the cell cycle, regulation of DNA replication and repair, apoptosis, among others. The most important gene expression changes occurred throughout the stationary phase when gene up-regulation markedly prevailed.
   Our RNA-seq data analysis enabled the identification of target genes for mechanism-based cell line engineering and bioprocess modification, an essential step to translate gene expression data from CHO-K1 host cells into bioprocess-related knowledge. Further efforts aim at increasing desirable phenotypes of CHO cells, and promoting efficient production of high quality therapeutic proteins can highly benefit from this type of studies.

AB Lactones are useful flavor compounds and some 5-hydroxy-gamma-butyrolactones also have important biological activities. In this study, a newly isolated Bacillus strain 1s-1 was identified to be capable of producing 5-hydroxy-gamma-decalactone (HDL) from peanut oil by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and authentic standards. The complete genome of this strain was sequenced and de novo assembled to a single circular chromosome of 4,166,290 bp with a guanine-cytosine content of 46.3%. The biosynthesis pathway of HDL in strain 1s-1 was postulated and this study provides helpful information for further utilizing Bacillus sp. 1s-1 as a source of valuable hydroxy lactones.

AB Cashew apple bagasse (CAB) has been studied as feedstock for the biohydrogen production using Clostridium roseum and the dark fermentation process. Pretreatment with alkaline hydrogen peroxide (CAB-AHP) on raw material and the acid and enzymatic hydrolysis have been taken into account to evaluate the H-2 yields. Results show that the acid hydrolysate obtained from CAB produced higher H-2 molar yield (HMY) (15 mmol(H2)/L-hydrolysate) than the acid hydrolysate from CAB-AHP (4.99 mmol(H2)/L-hydrolysate), These HMY were noticeably higher than values obtained from the enzymatic hydrolysate of CAB-AHP (1.05 mmol(H2)/L-hydrolysa) and the enzymatic hydrolysate of CAB (0.59 mmol(H2)/L-hydrolysa). The maximum biohydrogen productivity (12.57 mL(H2)/L.h) was achieved using the acid hydrolysate from CAB, with a H-2 content of about 72% vol, that could be satisfactory in view of an energetic applications of the biogas. Results suggest that CAB could be considered for the hydrogen production process, providing an appropriate destination for this lignocellulosic biomass, and consequently, reducing the environmental impact it can exert.

ID TRANSMISSION; MILK
AB In tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) endemic areas, consumption of unpasteurized milk or milk products from grazing domestic ruminants (goats, cattle, and sheep) represents a risk of TBE virus (TBEV) infection for humans. In addition to vaccination of humans, human alimentary TBEV infections can be avoided by pasteurizing milk or by vaccination of the ruminants. However, there is presently no TBEV vaccine for veterinary use. Here, we developed a new veterinary TBE vaccine candidate based on cell culture-derived, purified, and formaldehyde-inactivated TBEV (strain Hypr). The safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine was evaluated in mice and sheep and was well-tolerated while eliciting the production of high levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies. Vaccination provided full protection against lethal TBE in mice, prevented development of viremia in sheep and presence of TBEV in milk of lactating ewes. This vaccine is a good candidate for immunization of ruminants to prevent alimentary milk-borne TBEV infections in humans. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Influenza; Vaccination coverage rate; Risk factors; Meta-analysis
ID COST-EFFECTIVENESS; HEALTHY
AB Introduction: The best way to prevent influenza is receiving vaccination. However, the influenza vaccination coverage in mainland China was low. A meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the vaccination rates of the population and the factors influencing influenza vaccination in mainland China.
   Methods: A systematic study was conducted on March 18, 2018, using Chinese language databases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database, WanFang Database, and English language databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the pooled coverage rate and estimated odds ratios (OR) of influencing factors were obtained using data abstraction. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis were also employed to explore the heterogeneity.
   Results: The pooled vaccination coverage rate in 126 included articles was 23.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 22.8%, 23.7%), and the pooled vaccination rate among the general population was 9.4% (95% CI: 8.0%, 10.9%). The influenza vaccination rate fluctuated from 2005 to 2017. Vaccination rates in 2009-2010 were much higher than other years, pandemic influenza vaccination rate was 37.3% (95% CI: 28.4%, 46.1%) and seasonal influenza vaccination rate was 29.8% (95% CI: 24.6%, 34.9%). In the analysis of influencing factors, those recommended by healthcare workers was the most reported reasons for influenza vaccination with an OR = 5.2 (95% CI: 2.9, 9.4), and following as received influenza vaccination previously, perceived safety of vaccination, perceived effectiveness of vaccination, perceived severity of the disease. Meta-regression analysis indicate that the heterogeneity maybe significantly consistent with the sample size, study population, study region, and vaccination policy.
   Conclusion: Compared with other countries (the United States), vaccination rates were lower in mainland China. There were a few factors influencing the rate, which included vaccination policy, vaccination history and knowledge and attitudes toward influenza and vaccination. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pertussis is a vaccine-preventable disease that causes morbidity and mortality, particularly in infants and children <5 years of age. The Global Pertussis Initiative (GPI) recommendations represent a systematic evaluation and prioritization of strategies to prevent pertussis-related infant and child deaths, reduce global disease burden and prevent resurgence through vaccination strategies and public health policies at national, regional and local levels. The GPI recommendations are based on clinical trials and observational and surveillance data, which are essential in the planning, implementation and evaluation of vaccination practices and best use of available resources. Many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) continue to use whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccines for primary vaccination, while most high-income countries have replaced wP with the less-reactogenic acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines. This present manuscript pertains to discussions held during the GPI's meeting on November 11-13, 2016, in Cape Town, Republic of South Africa. The GPI recommends that LMIC aim for high coverage of infant series pertussis vaccines as a priority. In LMIC and countries with constrained vaccine funding, if wP vaccines are currently used, wP should continue to be used. Furthermore, given that protection against disease and death due to pertussis in neonates is a key priority of the GPI, it recommends that ap immunization in pregnancy should be implemented as a priority in all countries if resources allow. Given that surveillance and epidemiology data on which to base vaccine decisions are important, the GPI also suggests that, in areas where wP vaccines are implemented, standardization and calibration of wP vaccines are checked, considering the many different manufacturers and variable standards of production and quality control. In addition, as immunity to pertussis wanes following the primary infant series of vaccination, the GPI further recommends that toddlers, adolescents, healthcare and childcare workers receive booster vaccine doses, where resources allow.

AB Seasonal influenza results in substantial morbidity, mortality and socio-economic burden. The US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends vaccination of everyone over 6 months of age, but coverage remains substantially below the Healthy People 2020 target of 70% in most age groups. Influenza is different from other vaccine-preventable diseases in several ways that influence vaccine uptake. Although the incidence of most vaccine-preventable diseases is low, there is a perception that these diseases result in significant illness or death. In contrast, seasonal influenza has a relatively high incidence, but there is an incorrect perception of a lower disease severity. The vaccine effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines is less than other routine vaccines, varies from season to season between northern and southern hemispheres, and can be low in some seasons. It is also not well recognized that vaccination can attenuate the severity of influenza illness. Finally, the need for annual vaccination is perceived as a burden to busy people. Understanding these differences from the perspective of caregivers and vaccinees might help to improve influenza vaccine uptake. Presenting vaccine effectiveness in terms of clinical outcomes that have the most impact might help to overcome the perceptions that influenza is a non-serious disease and that the vaccine is not effective. The benefits of disease attenuation need to be emphasized in terms of reduced mortality, hospitalization, absenteeism and disruption to daily life. Innovative communication strategies should be adopted, including stronger recommendations from and to healthcare providers, continuous patient education, and social media initiatives employing more emotional and narrative approaches than traditionally used. Finally, access to seasonal influenza vaccination needs to be improved, and barriers such as cost and inconvenience removed. Multiple initiatives have already been successful. The remaining challenge is to translate individual successes into public health policies with corresponding funding and implementation. (C) 2018 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA.

AB The need for a systematic approach to research on vaccine effectiveness (VE) is increasing with growing numbers of vaccines and complexity of immunization programs. The diverse scientific fields that investigate how vaccines work and why they fail continue to evolve, yet definitions related to such advances have not kept pace. Researchers in disciplines ranging from basic science through immunopathology, clinical and epidemiological research, and mathematical modelling need more precise definitions to promote communication and interdisciplinary VE research to ensure that studies are designed to appropriately address relevant questions. To meet these aims, we suggest standardized definitions, consider models of vaccine failure, and offer general approaches for incorporation into study design. We further propose a framework for conducting VE research that builds on the traditional epidemiological triad of host, pathogen and environment, and also includes additional elements such as characteristics of both the vaccine and vaccinee, the effect of time on likelihood of exposure and protection, and the impact of environment and pathogen, as well as how outcomes of interest and study design may impact observed vaccine effectiveness. The framework is relevant to researchers in all disciplines who investigate the effectiveness of vaccines and vaccination programs and why they may fail. Stronger research in this field will help policy makers optimise decision-making on vaccination programs, ensuring we maximize the health benefits of vaccines. It is also important for clinicians communicating the benefits of vaccines to the public. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID IMMUNIZATION
AB Background: Nigeria's government is challenged with vaccinating the world's third largest birth cohort within a culturally and socioeconomically diverse country. This study estimated full childhood immunization coverage in Nigeria and characterizes the association between vaccination status and urbanicity, region of residence, ethnicity, and other factors.
   Methods: In 2013, households throughout Nigeria were enrolled in the Demographic and Health Survey which included questions about vaccination. We defined full vaccination of a child as having received a single dose of bacillus Calmete-Guerin (BCG), one dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV), three doses of diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (DPT), and four doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV). Using a multinomial logistic regression model, full vaccination and under-vaccination versus non-vaccination was regressed onto various demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.
   Results: Among 5759 children 1 year of age, 25.5% were fully vaccinated, 47.9% were under-vaccinated, and 26.6% had not received any vaccinations. Children were more likely to be fully vaccinated if they belonged to wealthier families, resided in southern regions of the country, were Christian, belonged to the lgbo or Yoruba ethnic group, had mothers who made >= 5 antenatal care visits, delivered at an institution, or were more highly educated.
   Conclusions: Full vaccination among children in Nigeria is exceptionally low by global standards and certain groups, such as Muslims and individuals in northern regions who are higher risk of non- or under vaccination should be targeted by vaccination programs. Providing a wide range of health care services for mothers and pregnant women could improve full vaccination of children. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To determine the proportion of children whose parents prefer them to receive live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) or inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), examine reasons for preferences, and determine what percentage of vaccinated children receive other than the preferred type of vaccine and why.
   Methods: Parental-reported data for the 2014-15 and 2015-16 influenza seasons from the National Immunization Survey-Flu (NIS-Flu), a random-digit-dialed, dual frame (landline and cellular telephone) survey of households with children, were analyzed. We calculated the proportions of vaccinated children aged 2-17 years whose parents preferred LAIV, IIV, or had no preference, and the proportions that were vaccinated with other than the preferred type of vaccine.
   Results: For the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons, 55.2% and 53.7%, respectively, of vaccinated children had parents who reported no preference for either IIV or LAIV. The percentage who preferred LAIV was 22.7% and 21.7%, and IIV was 22.1% and 24.7%. The most common reason given by parents for preferring LAIV was the child's fear of needles (70.9%) and for preferring IIV was belief that the shot is more effective (29.0%). Approximately one-third of vaccinated children whose parents preferred LAIV received IIV only.
   Conclusions: The main finding of this study was that most parents do not have a vaccine type preference for their children. The lack of overwhelming preference is advantageous for the maintenance of vaccination coverage levels during times when one vaccine type is not available or not recommended such as in the 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons when there was a temporary recommendation not to administer LAIV.

AB Influenza is an important public health issue and schools play an important part in preventing influenza outbreaks. However, little is known about teachers' knowledge and attitudes toward influenza and vaccination. The purposes of this project were to assess preservice and early career teachers' knowledge and attitudes of influenza, evaluate the effectiveness of a refutational text on increasing teachers' attitudes towards and knowledge of influenza and vaccination, and evaluate the effects of participant epistemology, motivation, and cognitive engagement on influenza attitudes and knowledge. We implemented an experimental intervention with 64 pre-service and early career teachers on the effects of a refutational text in remedying influenza misconceptions. Teachers in this sample have vaccination rates (36% received five vaccines in a five-year period) consistent with other US adults. Pre-intervention knowledge scores were moderate and attitudes were slightly positive. Positive attitudes were correlated with increased vaccination. We found refutational texts are effective in eliciting more positive attitudes toward influenza vaccination. We found cognitive engagement was positively correlated to change in attitude. Refutational texts provide an effective mode of influenza and vaccination education. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Staying home when sick can reduce the spread of influenza. The objectives of this study were to quantify the percentage of workers who had paid sick leave (PSL) benefits, examine sociodemographic characteristics that may be associated with having these benefits, and examine the association between having PSL benefits and use of sick days and influenza vaccination status.
   Methods: The public-use dataset from the 2009 National H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS) were analyzed in 2017. Wald chi-square tests and t-tests were used to test for associations between having PSL benefits and sociodemographic characteristics and industry and occupation groups, the associations between having PSL benefits and seeking treatment when sick with influenza-like illness (ILI), and taking days off work when sick with ILI. Logistic regression was used to determine variables associated with having PSL benefits and the association between having PSL benefits and influenza vaccination status.
   Results: Sixty-one percent of employed adults reported having PSL benefits during the 2009-10 influenza season. Being younger, female, Hispanic, less educated, or a farm/blue collar worker were associated with reduced likelihood of having PSL benefits. Not having PSL benefits was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving an influenza vaccination and visiting a health professional when sick with ILI.
   Conclusions: The percentage of workers who have PSL benefits differs by sociodemographic characteristics and industry/occupation groups. Offering PSL benefits along with promoting influenza vaccination and encouraging employees with ILI to stay home can increase influenza vaccination coverage and help control the spread of influenza.

AB Accidents with venomous animals pose a health issue in Brazil, and those involving brown spiders (Loxosceles sp.) figure between the most frequent ones. The accidental envenomation by brown spiders causes a strong local dermonecrotic effect, which can be followed by systemic manifestations that in some cases lead to death. The production of antivenoms for the treatments of such accidents relies on a variety of animal experiments, from the spider venom extraction to the production of antivenom in horses. In the present work, there is an attempt to reduce and optimize animal experiments with the construction and production of a chimeric protein, named Lil, containing immunodominant epitopes previously mapped from the main proteins of the Loxosceles venom, the Sphingomyelinases D. The Lil protein contains epitopes from Sphinomyelinases D of the three-main species found in Brazil and this chimeric protein was found capable of inducing antibodies with the potential to partially neutralize the toxic effects of Loxosceles intermedia venom in an animal model. Therefore, in order to reduce spider usage and to improve the lifespan of the horses used for immunization we suggest the Lil protein as a potential candidate to replace the venom usage in the antivenom production protocols.

ID SEASONAL INFLUENZA
AB Introduction: To evaluate the public health benefit of yearly influenza vaccinations, CDC estimates the number of influenza cases and hospitalizations averted by vaccine. Available input data on cases and vaccinations is aggregated by month and the estimation model is intentionally simple, raising concerns about the accuracy of estimates.
   Methods: We created a synthetic dataset with daily counts of influenza cases and vaccinations, calculated "true" averted cases using a reference model applied to the daily data, aggregated the data by month to simulate data that would actually be available, and evaluated the month-level data with seven test methods (including the current method). Methods with averted case estimates closest to the reference model were considered most accurate. To examine their performance under varying conditions, we re-evaluated the test methods when synthetic data parameters (timing of vaccination relative to cases, vaccination coverage, infection rate, and vaccine effectiveness) were varied over wide ranges. Finally, we analyzed real (i.e., collected by surveillance) data from 2010 to 2017 comparing the current method used by CDC with the best-performing test methods.
   Results: In the synthetic dataset (population 1 million persons, vaccination uptake 55%, seasonal infection risk without vaccination 12%, vaccine effectiveness 48%) the reference model estimated 28,768 averted cases. The current method underestimated averted cases by 9%. The two best test methods estimated averted cases with <1% error. These two methods also worked well when synthetic data parameters were varied over wide ranges (<= 6.2% error). With the real data, these two methods estimated numbers of averted cases that are a median 8% higher than the currently-used method.
   Conclusions: We identified two methods for estimating numbers of influenza cases averted by vaccine that are more accurate than the currently-used algorithm. These methods will help us to better assess the benefits of influenza vaccination. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Vaccination of cattle with Mycobacterium bovis BCG has been shown to protect against infection with virulent strains of M. bovis, and against resultant bovine tuberculosis (TB). Here we report on a large-scale trial in New Zealand where free-ranging cattle were vaccinated with 3 x 10(5) BCG via injection, a lower dose than any previously trialed in cattle against exposure to a natural force of M. bovis infection. In a multi-year enrolment study involving >800 animals, three cohorts of 1-2 year old cattle were randomised to receive vaccine or to serve as non-vaccinated controls. Cattle were slaughtered and subject to standard abattoir post mortem examination for M. bovis culture-positive TB lesions after up to 3.7 years of in-field exposure; additionally, lymph node samples from approximately half of the cattle were examined further to identify infection in the absence of lesions. Overall TB prevalence, as identified by gross lesions detected at slaughter, was low among farmed cattle at the study site (<4% annually). There were two lesioned cases among 520 vaccinated trial cattle (0.38%) compared to eight among 297 non vaccinated trial cattle (2.69%). Trial vaccine efficacy was 85.7% against abattoir-detectable TB (statistically significant protection), and 86.7% when adjusted for duration of exposure. BCG vaccination did not significantly affect the response rates of cattle to ante mortem skin- or blood-tests in diagnostic tests conducted >7 months post-vaccination. Use of a reduced, yet effective, dose of BCG would increase the cost effectiveness of using this vaccine in a bovine TB control programme. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the serotype- and topotype versatility of a replication-deficient human adenovirus serotype 5 vectored foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccine platform (AdtFMD). Sixteen AdtFMD recombinant subunit monovalent vaccines targeting twelve distinct FMD virus (FMDV) serotype/topotypes in FMD Regional Pools I-VII were constructed. The AdtA24 serotype conditionally licensed vaccine served as the basis for vaccine design and target dose for cattle clinical trials. Several vaccines contained an additional RGD motif genetic insertion in the adenovector fiber knob, and/or a full-length 2B gene insertion in the FMDV P1 gene cassette. In 13 of the 22 efficacy studies conducted, naive control and AdtFMD vaccinated cattle were challenged intradermolingually at 2 weeks post-vaccination using a FMDV strain homologous to the AdtFMD vaccine strain. Each of the 16 AdtFMD vaccines were immunogenic based on the presence of homologous neutralizing antibodies in the serum of approximately 90% of total vaccinates (n = 375) on the day of challenge. Importantly, for 75% of vaccines tested, the effective dose that conferred 100% protection against clinical FMD was identical to or in some cases lower than, the minimum protective dose for the conditionally licensed AdtA24 vaccine formulated with ENABL (R) adjuvant. Results also confirmed the capability of the AdtFMD vaccine platform to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) across the five FMDV serotypes evaluated. Collectively, this comprehensive set of FMD cattle vaccine dose ranging studies highlights the serotype- and topotype versatility of the AdtFMD vaccine platform for further development, licensure, and application in FMD outbreak control and disease eradication efforts.

AB The glycoprotein E2 of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is a major immunogenic protein that induces neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity. Thus, E2 is a suitable target antigen for the development of genetically engineered CSFV vaccines. However, these vaccines cannot generate complete protective immunity in their hosts, thereby limiting the scope of applications under field conditions. IFN-gamma is an immune adjuvant that has been shown to enhance antigen immune response in various experimental models. In this study, porcine IFN-gamma was used to improve the immunogenicity of the CSFV E2 subunit vaccine in pigs. Pigs were immunized with E2 subunit vaccine alone or in combination with IFN-gamma. Results demonstrated that porcine IFN-gamma did not enhance the CSFV-specific antibody and neutralizing antibody titers compared with the E2 subunit vaccine alone. However, co-administration of the E2 and IFN-gamma subunit vaccines significantly enhanced the CSFV-specific IFN-gamma expression. These findings indicated that porcine IFN-gamma can increase cellular immune responses to E2 protein in pigs. Furthermore, co-immunization with E2 + IFN-gamma subunit vaccine and C-strain conferred complete protection against CSFV. In contrast, E2 subunit vaccines provided incomplete protection in pigs. These results indicated that using IFN-gamma as an adjuvant with CSFV E2 subunit vaccines can enhance the specific protective immune response. Therefore, E2 + IFN-gamma subunit vaccine is a promising marker vaccine candidate for the control and eradication of CSF. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   state
ID NORTHERN NIGERIA; POLIO; FERTILITY; VACCINE
AB Background: The OPV 3 coverage for Kaduna State, 12-23 months old children was 34.4%. The low OPV 3 coverage, due mainly to weak demand for routine antigens and the need to rapidly boost population immunity against the disabling Wild Polio Virus (WPV), led the Global Polio Eradication Initiatives (GPEI) to increase supplemental OPV campaigns in Kaduna State, despite the huge cost and great burden on personnel. The OPV campaigns, especially in high risk (low vaccine uptake, <80% OPV 3 coverage and high vaccines refusal rate) states of northern Nigeria with poliovirus transmission has resulted in over-estimated denominators or target population, as the highest ever vaccinated is used to set OPV campaign targets.
   Methods: We utilized a cross-sectional study that assessed the impacts and possible solutions to the challenges of overestimated denominators in immunization services planning, delivery and performance evaluation in Kaduna State, Nigeria. We used both descriptive and quantitative approaches. We enumerated households and obtained the target populations for routine immunization (<1 year), polio campaign (<5 years) and acute flaccid paralysis surveillance (<15 years).
   Results: We found a significant difference in mean scores between the micro-planning and supplemental vaccination data on a number of <5 years (M = 102967, SD = 62405, micro-planning compared to M = 157716, SD = 72212, supplemental vaccination, p < 0.05). We also found a significant difference in mean scores between the micro-planning and projected census data on a number of <1 year (M = 26128, SD = 16828, micro-planning compared to M = 14154, SD = 4894, census, p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Periodic household-based micro-planning, aided with the use of technology for validation remains a useful tool in addressing gaps in immunization planning, delivery and performance evaluation in developing countries, such as Nigeria with overestimated denominators.

AB Background: Thirteen-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was introduced in Malawi in November 2011 and is offered to infants at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age as part of routine immunisation. PCV13 is expected to reduce vaccine type (VT) nasopharyngeal carriage, leading to reduced transmission and herd protection.
   Methods: We compared pneumococcal carriage in rural Karonga District, Malawi, pre-vaccine in 2009-2011 and post-vaccine in 2014 using a combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from a cohort of mother-infant pairs and household members <16 years. Pneumococci from 2009 to 2011 were serogrouped using latex agglutination and serotyped by Quellung reaction. In 2014, latex agglutination was used for both steps. Carriage prevalence ratios using prevalence data from before and after vaccine introduction were calculated by log-binomial regression, adjusted for age, seasonality and household composition. Participating infants in 2014 received PCV13 as part of routine immunisation.
   Results: VT carriage prior to PCV-13 introduction was 11.4%, 45.1%, 28.2%, 21.2% and 6.6% for 6-week old infants, 18-week old infants, children 1-4 years, children 5-15 years and mothers, respectively. After vaccine introduction, VT carriage decreased among vaccinated 18-week old infants (adjusted prevalence ratio 0.24 (95%CI 0.08-0.75)), vaccinated children 1-4 years (0.54 (0.33-0.88)), unvaccinated children 5-15 years (0.37 (0.17-0.78)) and mothers (0.34 (0.15-0.79)). No decrease in VT carriage was observed for 6-week old infants too young to be vaccinated (1.07 (0.38-3.02)) and PCV-13 ineligible children 1-4 years (0.84 (0.53-1.33)). Non-VT carriage increased only among vaccinated children 1-4 years (1.58 (1.21-2.06)).
   Conclusions: There is evidence of reduced VT pneumococcal carriage three years after vaccine introduction in this rural Malawian population with good vaccine coverage using a 3 + 0 schedule. However carriage was sustained among 6-week-old infants and PCV13 ineligible 1-4 year olds, and there was some indication of serotype replacement in vaccinated 1-4 year olds.

AB Background: In response to recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases and concerns around vaccine refusal, several high-income countries have adopted or reformed vaccine mandate policies. While all make it more difficult for parents to refuse vaccines, the nature and scope of 'mandatory vaccination' is heterogeneous, and there has been no attempt to develop a detailed, comparative systematic account of the possible forms mandates can take.
   Methods: We compare the construction, introduction/amendment, and operation of six new high profile vaccine mandates in Australia, France, Germany, Italy, California, and Washington. We rank these policies in order of their relative restrictiveness and analyze other differences between them.
   Results: New mandate instruments differ in their effects on behavior, and with regard to their structure, exemptions, target populations, consequences and enforcement. We identify diverse means by which vaccine mandates can restrict behaviors, various degrees of severity, and different gradations of intensity in enforcement.
   Conclusion: We suggest that politico-cultural context and vaccine policy history are centrally important factors for vaccine mandate policymakers to consider. It matters whether citizens trust their governments to limit individual freedom in the name of public health, and whether citizens have previously been subjected to vaccine mandates. Furthermore, political communities must consider the diverse mechanisms by which they may construct vaccine mandate policies; whether through emergency decrees or ordinary statutes, and how (or whether) to involve various stakeholder groups in developing and implementing new vaccine mandate policies.

TI Global landscape of measles and rubella surveillance
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Measles; Rubella; Surveillance; Elimination
AB Background: All six World Health Organization (WHO) regions have committed to eliminate measles, and three WHO regions have committed to eliminate rubella. One of the key tenets of measles and rubella elimination is to have a strong surveillance system in place. The presence of a case-based measles and rubella surveillance system that is national, population-based, provides laboratory confirmation, and directs action, is one of the requirements for elimination-standard surveillance.
   Methods: In order to understand the global landscape for measles and rubella surveillance, a questionnaire was sent to all 194 WHO member states (herein referred to as countries) requesting information on how surveillance was conducted for measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome. Data were supplemented with information provided to WHO through other reporting mechanisms and by national policy documents available to the public. Frequencies and percentages were calculated.
   Results: Data were available to review from 164 (85%) countries, although not every country responded to every question. Case-based, population-based, national surveillance with laboratory confirmation was reported to be conducted in 136 (86%) of 158 countries for measles and 122 (77%) of 158 countries for rubella. Congenital rubella syndrome surveillance was reported to be conducted by 126 (77%) of 163 countries. Gaps were noted in the quality of measles-rubella surveillance conducted, and 26 (16%) of 158 countries reported not including all healthcare providers as mandatory reporters.
   Conclusions: Many countries reported having some of the essential components in place to conduct elimination-standard surveillance for measles and rubella; however, in order to achieve elimination, the quality of surveillance needs to improve to detect all cases. In those countries without these essential components of elimination-standard surveillance, the first step is to implement these components. (C) 2018 World Health Organization.

AB Human-wildlife conflicts are increasing worldwide. For instance, growing numbers of free-roaming feral cattle in Hong Kong are causing traffic accidents and damaging crops. Public antipathy towards lethal methods to manage wildlife has promoted research into alternative options, such as fertility control. The aims of this study were to assess the potential side effects and effectiveness of the injectable immunocontraceptive vaccine GonaCon on free-roaming feral cattle in Hong Kong. Sixty female cattle were captured and randomly assigned to treatment or control groups. Treatment animals were administered one dose of GonaCon, followed by a booster dose 3-6 months later. Control animals were administered an equivalent dose of a saline solution. The side effects of GonaCon were assessed by monitoring injection site, body condition and body weight at vaccination, at the booster stage and one year after initial vaccination. At the same times, blood samples were collected to quantify antibodies to the vaccine and to assess pregnancy status. GonaCon did not affect the body weight or body condition of cattle and had no adverse side effects such as injection site reactions, limping or abnormal behaviour. GonaCon did not appear to interrupt ongoing pregnancies but reduced fertility significantly: the proportion of pregnant animals in the GonaCon-treated group decreased from 76% at initial vaccination to 6% one year after vaccination, compared to 67% and 57% respectively in the control group. There was no difference between antibody titres at the booster stage or one year post vaccination, suggesting the booster dose maintained antibody levels. This study confirmed that GonaCon is safe and effective in inducing infertility in feral cattle, with a booster dose critical for maintaining infertility.

AB Background: The introduction of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) to the Philippines' national immunization schedule meant the addition of a third injectable vaccine at a child's 14-week immunization visit. Although previous studies have shown that providing multiple vaccines at the same time affected neither the risk of severe adverse events nor vaccine efficacy, concerns were raised that providing three injections at a single visit, with two injections in one leg, might be unacceptable to health care providers (HCP) and infant caregivers.
   Methods: We conducted pre- and post-IPV introduction surveys on the acceptance and acceptability of the additional injectable vaccine in three of the Philippines' 17 administrative regions. Regions 3 and 6 were included in the pre-introduction phase and Regions 3, 6 and 10 were included in the post-introduction phase. Thirty public health centers (PHCs) were randomly sampled from each region. HCPs and infant caregivers were interviewed. In addition, vaccination records from a minimum of 20 eligible children pre-introduction and 10 children post-introduction per PHC were reviewed.
   Results and discussion: We interviewed 89 HCPs and 286 infant caregivers during the pre-introduction phase and 137 HCPs and 455 caregivers during the post-introduction phase. Among 986 vaccination records reviewed post-introduction, 84% (n = 826) of children received all three recommended injections at one visit, with a range from 61% (209/342) in Region 10 to 100% (328/328) in Region 3. The proportion of HCPs reporting that they had administered three or more injectable vaccines and the proportion of caregivers that would be comfortable with their child receiving three or more injectable vaccines at one visit increased from pre- to post-introduction (p < 0.0001 for both). Eighty-seven percent of HCPs that had administered three or more injectable vaccines post-introduction reported being comfortable or very comfortable with the number of vaccines they had administered.

AB Background: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has routinely recommended zoster vaccine live (ZVL) for adults >= 60 since 2008; only 33% of eligible adults received it by 2016. A recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) was licensed in 2017 and ACIP recommended in January 2018. Our objectives were to assess among primary care physicians (1) practices and attitudes regarding ZVL and (2) awareness of RZV.
   Methods: We administered an Internet and mail survey from July to September 2016 to national networks of 953 primary care physicians.
   Results: Response rate was 65% (603/923). Ninety-three % of physicians recommended ZVL to adults >= 60, but fewer recommended it to adults >= 60 with a prior history of zoster (88%), adults > 85 (62%) and adults >= 60 on low-dose methotrexate (42%). Several physicians recommended ZVL in ways that are not recommended by ACIP including to adults 50-59 (50%), adults >= 60 with HIV (33%), and adults >= 60 on high dose prednisone (>= 20 mg/day) (27%). Nineteen percent of physicians stocked and administered ZVL and did not refer patients elsewhere for vaccination, 37% did not stock and only referred patients to receive it, and 44% both stocked/administered and referred elsewhere. Twenty-three % (n = 115) of physicians who had ever administered ZVL in the office (n = 490) had stopped, citing primarily financial issues (90%). Only 5% were 'very aware' of RZV.
   Conclusions: Physicians report not recommending ZVL to certain ACIP-recommended groups, but report recommending it to some groups for which the vaccine should be avoided. Implementation of recommendations for RZV will need to consider financial barriers and the complex patchwork of office-based and pharmacy delivery ZVL has encountered. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: The Islamic Hajj pilgrimage is the largest annual mass gathering in the world. The overcrowding of people promotes the acquisition, spread and transmission of respiratory pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae.
   Methods: We conducted a methodological review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. The objective was to summarize the available data regarding the prevalence of pneumococcal carriage among Hajj pilgrims and about carriage acquisition and circulation of S. pneumoniae among pilgrims before and after participating in the Hajj according to their vaccination status.
   Results: Eight articles met eligibility criteria for pneumococcal carriage and impact of pneumococcal vaccination on carriage. Seven of them showed a significant increase in nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococci following the pilgrimage, with acquisition rates ranging from 18 to 36%. Serotypes 3, 19F and 34 are the most common. A significant increase in antibiotic resistant strains was observed following participation in the Hajj. A lower prevalence was found in pilgrims treated with antibiotics, those who used a hand sanitizer, or those who washed their hands more frequently than usual. An increased carriage of pneumococcal serotypes included in pneumococcal vaccines (10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10), 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23)) was observed following participation in the Hajj. To date, no study has shown a significant reduction in pneumococcal carriage among pilgrims after vaccination with PPV23 or PCV. In fact, no significant difference was currently observed in the prevalence ratio of pneumococcal carriage between vaccinated and unvaccinated pilgrims.
   Conclusion: The studies analyzed in this review showed an increased carriage of pneumococcus in post-Hajj pilgrims compared to pre-Hajj pilgrims, including vaccine serotypes. Further studies are needed to investigate the possible relationships between carriage, disease and vaccine in pilgrims. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Homeopathic vaccines are licensed in many countries but scientific data to support their use are sparse. The goal of this study was to compare the antibody response of homeopathic and conventional vaccines and placebo in young adults. We hypothesized that there would be no significant difference between homeopathic vaccines and placebo, while there would be a significant increase in antibodies in those received conventional vaccines.
   Methods: A randomized blinded placebo-controlled trial was conducted where 150 university students who had received childhood vaccinations were assigned to diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, mumps, measles homeopathic vaccine, placebo, or conventional diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (Tdap) and mumps, measles, rubella (MMR) vaccines. The primary outcome was a >= two-fold increase in antibodies from baseline following vaccination as measured by ELISA. Participants, investigators, study coordinator, data blood drawers, laboratory technician, and data analyst were blinded.
   Results: None of the participants in either the homeopathic vaccine or the placebo group showed a >= -two -fold response to any of the antigens. In contrast, of those vaccinated with Tdap, 68% (33/48) had a >= -two-fold response to diphtheria, 83% (40/48) to pertussis toxoid, 88% (42/48) to tetanus, and 35% (17/48) of those vaccinated with MMR had a response to measles or mumps antigens (p < 0.001 for each comparison of conventional vaccine to homeopathic vaccine or to placebo). There was a significant increase in geometric mean titres of antibody from baseline for conventional vaccine antigens (p < 0.001 for each), but none for the response to homeopathic antigens or placebo.
   Conclusions: Homeopathic vaccines do not evoke antibody responses and produce a response that is similar to placebo. In contrast, conventional vaccines provide a robust antibody response in the majority of those vaccinated. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This report covers the topics of pandemics, epidemics and partnerships, including regulatory convergence initiatives, new technologies and novel vaccines, discussed by leading public and private sector stakeholders at the 18th Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers' Network (DCVMN). Contributions of Gavi and the vaccine industry from emerging countries to the growing global vaccine market, by improving the supply base from manufacturers in developing countries and contributing to 58% of doses, were highlighted. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the International Vaccine Institute (IVI) and others reported on new strategies to ensure speedy progress in preclinical and clinical development of innovative vaccines for future MERS, Zika or other outbreak response. Priorities for vaccine stockpiling, to assure readiness during emergencies and to prevent outbreaks due to re-emerging diseases such as yellow fever, cholera and poliomyelitis, were outlined. The role of partnerships in improving global vaccine access, procurement and immunization coverage, and shared concerns were reviewed. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other international collaborating partners provided updates on the Product, Price and Procurement database, the prequalification of vaccines, the control of neglected tropical diseases, particularly the new rabies elimination initiative, and regulatory convergence proposals to accelerate vaccine registration in developing countries. Updates on supply chain innovations and novel vaccine platforms were presented. The discussions enabled members and partners to reflect on efficiency of research & development, supply chain tools and trends in packaging technologies improving delivery of existing vaccines, and allowing a deeper understanding of the current public-health objectives, industry financing, and global policies, required to ensure optimal investments, alignment and stability of vaccine supply in developing countries.

TI Estimating the eco-toxicological risk of estrogens in China's rivers

AB The contamination of freshwater systems arises in many river basins due to industrialization and population growth, posing risks to ecosystems and human health. Despite these concerns, the fate and potential impact of many emerging pollutants are currently unknown, especially when the compounds are released into surface waters from populations distributed across large spatial scales. In order to address this shortcoming, a spatially-explicit contaminant fate model was developed as an extension of the global, vector-based river routing model HydroROUT. HydroROUT operates at very high spatial resolution (similar to 500 m), simulates river and stream chemical transport with in-stream removal, and contains links to a set of lakes and reservoirs, which act as a partial sink during the transport. The chemical fate model was applied to China and includes a consumption and release module based on county-level population demographics, considers point-source contributions from 2547 wastewater treatment plants, and accumulates contributions of rural and urban populations not connected to sewage treatment plants. As a case study, the sources and fates of the estrogens estrone (E-1), 17 beta-estradiol (E-2), estriol (E-3), as well as the synthetic estrogenic steroid hormone 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) were modelled in Chinese surface water bodies. Preliminary validation of the results showed predictions to be within the ranges of concentrations reported in literature, with exception of EE2. The total estrogenic mass in the entire river and lake system amounted to 370 tonnes of estrogens, with about 1.3 tonnes per year discharged to the ocean, neighboring countries or to inland sinks. Under a selected baseline scenario, eco-toxicological risk - i.e., contaminant concentrations in excess of the predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) - is found in 23.6% of all analyzed rivers of China with an average flow > 0.1 m(3)/s. Out of these, about 4% of rivers showed a high level of risk of 10 times or more above PNEC. Medium-to-large rivers are disproportionally affected; for example, 23.6%, 37.3%, 29.0% and 21.6% of river length are at risk in rivers of 1-10, 10-100, 100-1,000, and 1,000-10,000 m(3)/s of discharge, respectively, whereas no risk was predicted in the largest rivers (i.e., >10,000 m(3)/s) of China. Wastewater treatment plants process 22.5% of the total hormone load and thus play an important role in water quality control by reducing the risk in substantial portions of the river network, which would otherwise show elevated risk. Releases from untreated population dominate by far the overall contribution to risk. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The high solar light concentration onto the photovoltaic cell leads to extremely high cell temperature, which significantly decreases the cell efficiency and degrades its lifetime due to the thermal stresses. One of the main challenges of these types of solar cells is to propose an efficient cooling technique that allows the cells to operate under its recommended operating conditions. Therefore, the focus of this study was to develop a comprehensive three-dimensional model for the high concentrator photovoltaic/thermal (HCPV/T) system. This model comprises a thermal model for a triple-junction solar cell integrated with a thereto-fluid model for four distinct designs of confined jet impingement heat sinks. The results showed that the cell electrical efficiency increased with the coolant flow rate, and sufficient temperature uniformity can be achieved by the jet impingement configurations. Additionally, the use of jet impingement configurations consumed a slight pumping power less than 1% of the generated power in the solar cell. The maximum local temperature of uncooled solar cell was predicted to reach 1360 degrees C under solar concentration ratio of 1000 Suns. Under the same conditions, the single jet design reduced the maximum local temperature to about 65 degrees C with coolant mass flow rate of 50 g/min. It should be noted that the thermal stress substantially decreased with the increasing coolant mass flow rate. Exergetic analysis showed that the single jet design attained the maximum total exergy efficiency of 53.25% at the flow rate of 25 g/min.

AB Enzymatic transesterification for biodiesel synthesis have gained significant attention due to green and advantageous process over alkali and acid catalysed reactions. In this view, the present study elucidates the synthesis of carbonaceous catalyst support for immobilisation of lipase enzyme towards its use as heterogeneous biocatalyst in biodiesel synthesis. The study mainly emphasised on the optimisation of parametric conditions for catalyst synthesis process towards maximisation of adsorption capacity and catalytic activity in transesterification. The parametric effects on immobilisation process were studied to identify the significance of individual parameter using taguchi approach. The significance of each parameter was tested by ANOVA study and confirmed by estimating contribution factor. The analysis illustrates that initial concentration, pH and time affects the adsorption capacity significantly. However, the catalytic activity in transesterification is affected significantly by catalyst preparation conditions like temperature, pH and initial concentration. The optimised condition evaluated for catalyst preparation to achieve maximum adsorption capacity and biodiesel yield were: initial concentration 400 ppm, temperature 30 degrees C, time 120 min and pH 6. Thus, the study revealed that indigenously prepared carbon supported lipase enzyme at optimised conditions were effective in catalysing the methanolysis of rubber seed oil to achieve the renewable biodiesel fuel. The study has also shown that taguchi approach was effective in identifying the significant parameters affecting the immobilisation process and achieving optimised condition for cost-effective synthesis of catalyst to ultimately minimise the cost of biodiesel synthesis process.

AB Piezoelectric energy harvesting from ambient vibration sources has great potential for powering microelectronic devices and wireless sensors. Almost all the conventional piezoelectric energy harvesters (CPEHs) in the literature have been designed with a single metallic layer as substrate along with the piezoelectric material bonded over it. In this work, a novel sandwich structure is used as substrate for designing harvester. The substrate structure comprises of a soft-core material sandwiched between metallic layers. The proposed sandwich piezoelectric energy harvester (SPEH) has lower resonant frequency and generates higher voltage output than the CPEH with the same geometrical dimension. Furthermore, the SPEH offers high design flexibility in terms of tuning the resonant frequency through selection of materials and geometric parameters for the core and metal layers. The mathematical formulation of a generalized electromechanical model of the SPEH is developed using the Lagrange approach. The natural frequencies, displacement and voltage frequency response functions of the harvester are obtained analytically. A single-degree-of-freedom model for the SPEH is also derived. Subsequently, the analytical modeling is validated by finite element simulations and experimental results. When excited at 0.1 g, the SPEH generates 18.8% more voltage output at resonance as compared with a CPEH with the same geometrical dimension and tip mass accompanied by 24% reduction in resonant frequency. At 30 Hz resonance frequency, CPEH generates open-circuit voltage 17.6 V using 15 g of tip mass whereas SPEH uses only 8.2 g of tip mass to generate 16.6 V.SPEH generates 130.8 mu W, 426.6 mu W and 1158.0 mu W at base accelerations 0.05 g, 0.1 g and 0.2 g with optimal resistance, respectively. Finally, the influence of geometric and material properties of core and metallic layers on the performance of SPEH are analyzed comprehensively. The proposed novel SPEH together with its analytical modeling is intended to serve as a basis for future sandwich harvester designs.

AB This paper focuses on thermodynamic balancing of the regeneration process in a hybrid liquid desiccant cooling/desalination system. The thermal balancing technique is investigated by adding a single extraction between the system regenerator and condenser. This technique is considered as a potential method to reduce energy consumption and increase the hybrid system performance, dramatically. The mathematical procedure to model the proposed system using enthalpy pinch is outlined to study the effect of extraction on the hybrid system performance. The hybrid system, with a single extraction and without extraction (zero extraction), is analyzed in terms of the normalized entropy generation, local enthalpy losses, the coefficient of performance, and proper extraction location. The results show that at enthalpy pinch of 20 kJ per kg of dry air, single extraction system performance is 85.7% better than zero extraction. In addition, the single extraction produces 103.2 kg of fresh water per hour as a by-product compared to 94.2 kg per hour for the zero extraction system.

AB The flow field on bipolar plates of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is critical to flow distribution and overall pressure drop, both of which have great influence on cell performance. A micro-distributor was proposed to improve the uniformity of flow distribution in parallel flow field. The effects of micro-distributor size on output cell performance and pressure drop were systematically studied with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. To evaluate the competence of the modified parallel flow field, a serpentine flow field was also considered for comparison. The results suggest that the modification of the flow field is able to enhance the uniformity of flow distribution significantly. The maximum output power density increases when decreasing the size of micro-distributor. Compared with the serpentine flow field, the modified parallel flow field with micro-distributor enables the fuel cell to give nearly comparable output performance, but requires two orders of magnitude lower pressure. More generally, it was found that the flow uniformity could be simply and conveniently improved by enhancing the mean pressure drop in the sub-channels. The origin of non-uniform distribution of oxygen concentration in the interface of gas diffusion layer (GDL) and catalyst layer (CL) was also discussed. This work provides an alternative to conventional parallel and serpentine flow fields, and is helpful for the designing of high output PEMFCs.

AB The tri-generative system based on advanced adiabatic compressed air energy storage can simultaneously provide cooling energy, heating energy and mechanical energy. In order to study the discharge characteristics, three operation modes of expanders, which contain constant pressure, constant-sliding and sliding pressure, are proposed in this paper. By utilizing the numerical simulation method, the performance difference of three modes is compared with each other. The results show that four performance indexes of constant-sliding mode are all the biggest, which are respectively cycle efficiency 40.55%, thermal efficiency 80.06%, exergy efficiency 48.45% and exergy density 4.071 x 10(6) Jm(-3), and cooling capacity of it is also the strongest, 8.386 x 10(9) J, among the three operation modes. Air storage chamber has the largest exergy destruction. Operation process of air storage chamber is similar for three operation modes. Meanwhile, the effects of heat exchanger effectiveness, ambient pressure and air storage chamber model on system performance are also investigated.

AB The safety, performance and durability of the Li-ion battery module are limited by the operating temperature especially in the hot temperature regions, hence the thermal management system is essential for battery module. In this paper a novel phase change material (PCM) and fin structure was proposed for the thermal management system of LiFePO4 battery module to reduce the maximum temperature and improve the temperature uniformity in high-temperature environment (40 degrees C). Carefully designed experiments were performed for model validation. The effects of PCM species, fin thickness, fin spacing and PCM thickness on the cooling performance of battery module were investigated numerically. The results showed that PCM-fin structure thermal management system with optimized design exhibited good thermal performance, keeping the maximum temperature of the battery surface under 51 degrees C at relatively high discharge rate of 3C. Moreover, by investigating the thermal behavior of PCM during discharge process and cycle test, it has been found that PCM-fin structure has the advantage of improving natural convection and heat conduction within the PCM structure, and as a result enhances heat dissipation efficiency and reduces failure risk in passive thermal management systems using PCMs.

AB In this study, response surface methodology (RSM) and the desirability approach are applied to study and optimize the performance of a free piston Stirling engine (FPSE). A regression model is presented to investigate the influences of operating and structural parameters of the FPSE on its performance. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) is conducted to describe the rationality of the regression model and examine the statistical significance of factors. Also, the relationship between output power, thermal and exergy efficiency and these parameters of Stirling engine is presented via 2D contour and 3D surface plots. Moreover, the operating and structural parameters of FPSE are optimized to achieve maximal output power, thermal and exergy efficiencies simultaneously. The multi-objective optimal results are confirmed by Sage software simulation results. It is found that the errors between the Sage modeling and RSM values for output power, thermal and exergy efficiency are 0.37%, 1.51% and 1.40%, respectively. Therefore, the model based on the RSM method is an efficient and fast way for the design and optimization of the FPSEs.

AB The integration of sectors for more sustainable systems and processes provide a multi-disciplinary research domain to which researchers are contributing with intense motivation in the context of urgency for addressing global climate change. The 26 papers in the current special issue of the 12th Conference on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems represent a pursuit of excellence for leading related advancements. This editorial contains a review of these advances with a focus on the themes of effective valorisation of bioenergy resources, energy-water nexus in wastewater treatment processes, optimized local energy supply for efficient and clean systems, solar energy technologies for the energy transition, and technologies for efficient combustion and electric transport. Other themes are alternative and cross-cutting technologies for the energy system in addition to analyses of thermal energy recovery and heat transfer. Significant contributions under these themes relate to biomass residues and biogas upgrading processes, novel renewable energy and performance comparisons in the wastewater sector, efficient micro-cogeneration, polygeneration and load sharing approaches, clustering techniques in district heating networks as well as hybrid and concentrated solar power systems. Control strategies for latent energy storage, aging processes in battery packs, engine knock occurrence and coupled numerical engine modelling, fuel blends with nanoparticle additives, utilization of flue gas, soot formation in plastic waste pyrolysis, high altitude wind energy systems as well as exergy analyses for heat and cold recovery and reverse electrodialysis are other key contributions. The advances are expected to enable more sustainable energy conversion and management processes in a time when an integrated approach is nothing less than essential to maintain a coherent and liveable Planet.

AB Ejector systems are receiving considerable attention due to their simplicity, lower maintenance requirements, use of low grade heat, longer lifespan and low cost. In this paper an improved model to predict the performance of an ejector refrigeration system under both the critical and subcritical, modes of operation was developed and validated. The model predicts ejector performance more precisely compared to studies following the same modeling approach in the literature. Using the developed model, performances with environmentally benign refrigerants, including R1233zd(E), HF01336mzz(7), R1234ze(Z), R600, RE245fa2, and RE245fa2 as alternatives to R141b and R245fa were investigated. Furthermore, for ejector area ratios between 4.45 and 12.98, evaporator temperatures between 0 degrees C and 16 degrees C and condenser temperatures between 20 and 40 degrees C, the optimal performance of the ejector system was determined. Results show that for each refrigerant, higher area ratios give higher coefficients of performance, but require higher generator temperatures for better critical condensing temperatures. R600 showed the best performance followed by R12342e(Z) and R1233Zd(E) for the entire range of parameters considered. Results further show that there is an optimum generator temperature at each area ratio that maximizes performance. The optimal generator temperature increases as the area ratio and the condensing temperature increase. An alternative and more convenient approach to optimize ejector performance has been suggested in this work.

AB Aim to effectively improve the removal and transport of liquid water in the flow channel in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), we designed a slope turn in the serpentine flow channel and conducted numerical simulations using volume-of-fluid method to investigate the water behavior in it, To optimize the slope turn, the effects of the sectional area and slope angle of the slope turn and the wettability of channel wall on the transport and dynamics of water were investigated. Besides, cases with different sizes of single water droplet and the interactions between multiple droplets were also considered. For single droplet, the results suggest that with the designed slope turn, water droplet can be effectively removed from the surface of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) though the channel walls are hydrophobic. Without slope turn, the water droplet is transported downstream, always being attached on the MEA surface. The designed slope turn is also applicable for the case of multiple droplets to enhance water removal from the MEA surface.

AB In this paper, flow characteristics and heat transfer applications of a helical coil with four different lobed cross sections are investigated numerically. The flow is laminar, Reynolds number changes from 1300 to 2500 and the wall of the helical coil in all the simulations has a constant temperature of 373 K. Effects of cross section lobe number (n) on heat transfer rate and pressure drop are studied. The results show that a coil with n = 6 presents the highest Nusselt number (Nu) and the lowest friction factor coefficient (f). In the next step, effects of different geometrical parameters (coil pitch, height, and diameter) and different fluids (Prandtl number) are studied. It is observed that the coil diameter has the greatest effect in comparison to the other geometrical parameters. Last but not the least, the effect of adding Al2O3 nanoparticles to water is discussed. It can be observed that upon using Al2O3-Water nanofluid, the Nusselt number increased 28 percent compared to water as the working fluid. But, it is seen that the friction factor coefficient does not change considerably. Moreover, it can be seen that the higher volume concentrations result in higher heat transfer rates. Finally, a correlation based on the numerical data for predicting Nusselt number is presented.

AB The n-pentanol/diesel dual-fuel coupled with EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) technology could simultaneously reduce soot and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions discharged from the compression ignition engine. However, under high EGR rates, the low cetane number of the n-pentanol/diesel dual fuel resulted to combustion deceleration behavior. Because the combustion rate has a significant influence on the thermal efficiency of the engine, it was necessary to add 2-ethylhexyl nitrate (ET-IN) as a cetane improver to fuel mixtures to ensure that the n-pentanol/diesel fuel has appropriate combustion characteristics. In this study, it was attempted to investigate the performance and emission of a four-cylinder, turbocharged diesel engine with EHN fueled with n-pentanol/diesel blends at varying EGR rates. The five tested fuels included pure diesel (P0), and a mixture of 50% n-pentanol and 50% diesel (P50). Moreover, EHN was added to P50 at ratios of 0.5, 1, and 2%. The results showed that P50 could reduce soot emission, nucleation and accumulation mode particles. However, the burning speed and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) were notably reduced, and emissions of hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) significantly increased. With the EGR technology, NOx emission was significantly reduced. When EHN was added to P50, engine ignition delay was shortened, BTE increased, and HC and CO emissions were substantially reduced. The use EGR technology combined with n-pentanol and El-IN simultaneously reduced soot and NOx emissions, and only slightly reduced BTE.

AB The ideal gas model with temperature-independent heat capacities is the most widely used thermodynamic model in gas turbine cycle simulations. This model is sometimes known as the "perfect gas model". Closed analytical expressions for specific works and temperatures of the cycle are obtained in this way. If the results are accurate enough then the perfect gas model becomes a powerful analysis tool because its simplicity. For this reason it is the usually chosen option when energy, exergy or thermoeconomic assessments and optimizations of gas turbine cycles are carried out. However, there is a shortage of research works about the analysis of the uncertainty in the calculation of the performance parameters of open-cycle gas turbines with respect to the ideal gas model-based approach (ideal gas with temperature-dependent heat capacities). This analysis is presented in this paper for the simple cycle taking the net specific work output or specific power of the cycle and its Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) as the performance parameters to be analyzed. First, to gain in internal coherence, an accurate thermodynamic model of the simple cycle based on the ideal gas assumption with temperature-dependent heat capacities is presented. For the sake of accuracy the isobaric heat capacity functions used in this model for every gaseous component present in the cycle are the employed in developing its actual multi parameter equations of state as real fluids. Once this model is established the perfect gas simplification is applied which requires a procedure or rule to evaluate the constant heat capacity values needed. In many cases this rule is not always given or is not clearly specified in the specific literature. In this paper four different evaluation methods (named as A, B, C and D) are considered. These methods are designed to be directly run from known input fixed parameters of the cycle model. The analysis of the absolute and relative errors in computations with the perfect gas approach with the four heat capacity evaluation methods is then carried out. The main result from the analysis is, that-the own configuration of the open-cycle can lead to an increase amplification) of the uncertainty in the values of the performance parameters. It is also observed that: (1) this amplification also depends on the method used to evaluate the heat capacities and (2) for a given evaluation method the amplification of the deviations may affect the performance parameters differently. As an example, maximum relative errors of 4.4% and 19.2% are observed in the net specific work output with methods C and D respectively for compressor pressure ratios from 5:1 to 40:1 and turbine inlet temperatures from 1200 K to 1800 K. For the SFC maximum values are 19.51% with method C and 3.95% with method D.

AB This study proposes a novel integrated solar-TPV device with a solid oxide electrolyzer cell to utilize the solar energy for hydrogen production. It explores the possibility of employing a high temperature solar-thermal photovoltaic power generation technology as a power source for a steam electrolyzer as a high-efficiency and applicable hydrogen production method. Mathematical and electrochemical modeling of the subsystems is conducted and performance of the system in different operating conditions such as current density, temperature, and steam mole fraction of SOEC is analyzed. An STPV device of multiwalled carbon nanotube (MW-CNT) absorber and 1D Si/SiO2 PhC emitter and InGaAsSb PV cell is employed to maximize the solar energy utilization. A detailed system level model in this part is conducted and the solar to electrical efficiency of the scaled-up STPV device reached to 17%. The results show that this STPV device can provide the power demand in SOEC system. A planar cathode-supported high-temperature electrolyzer cell was designed to perform in an exothermic mode and the result was validated by the experimental data precisely. The sensitivity analysis showed that 7458 kg/h hydrogen can be produced in the proposed system with 54% electrical for SOEC efficiency. The major implementation challenges are presented to provide a comprehensive insight into performance, potential development, limitations and challenges of the integrated system. The proposed combined system shows the overall efficiency can reach to 34%. This high efficiency makes this novel hybrid system a competitive option in solar based hydrogen production technologies.

AB Catalytic fast pyrolysis of bamboo sawdust was conducted by a tandem bubbling fluidized bed/fixed bed reactor. Effect of pyrolysis and catalyst temperatures on product yield was studied. In addition, synergistic effect of HZSM-5 and base catalysts (including CaO, MgO, and SrO) for the promotion of aromatic hydrocarbons was revealed. Experimental results illustrated that both pyrolytic and catalytic reactor temperatures played pivotal roles in the yield of bio-oil, and the optimal pyrolysis and catalytic reactor temperatures were 550 degrees C and 500 degrees C, respectively. Ex-situ catalytic trial decreased the yield of hio-oil compared to in-situ run, while it facilitated the formation of phenol and alkylphenols. Mixed catalytic upgrading modes exhibited more significant aromatization and deoxygenation activities than sequential ones. In particular, ex-situ run using CaO mixed with HZSM-5 increased the concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons to 31.34%, which was 11.48% higher than that derived from CaO and HZSM-5 sequentially processed mode. The dominated products in alkylphenols were cresol isomers and ethylphenols, and compared to sequential cases, mixed catalytic upgrading trials promoted the relative selectivity of phenol. Synergistic effect of base catalysts and HZSM-5 contributed to the production of mono cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and CaO mixed with HZSM-5 mode showed the most prominent synergistic effect for the enhanced relative selectivity to xylenes and toluene.

AB A two-stage stochastic model is presented to develop the supply chain network and determine the optimal integrated network design by integrating CO2 mitigation and utility supply strategies with uncertain utility demand. The objective of this model is to decide the total network cost while meeting the utility demands and the targets of CO2 mitigation for each company over four seasons and uncertain demands for utilities. This model determines where and how much (1) utility (steam) to be transported among many companies, and (2) CO2 to be captured, transported from companies and stored, or (3) carbon credits to be levied for companies that emit excessive CO2. This model is assessed from the case study of Industrial Complex located at Yeosu in South Korea with uncertain utility demand. Optimized total costs estimated by the stochastic model (US$ 198.88 x 10(6)/y) were slightly (0.68%) higher than that of the deterministic model (US$ 198.58 x 10(6)/y). Variation in utility demand (stochastic model) affected both strategies, compared to the case of fixed utility demand (deterministic model). Steam transfer links decreases as utility demand increases, so carbon credits trading is a better option than carbon capture and storage system as a CO2 mitigation strategy.

AB This study aimed at further improving the combustion efficiency of the diesel rotary engine (DRE), and in this regard a novel natural gas-diesel rotary engine (NO-DRE) was numerically studied. Based on the experimental validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, a 3D-dynamic numerical study of the NG-DRE was carried out by adopting NG port injection plus diesel direct injection mode. The influence of natural gas injection timing (NGIT) and diesel injection timing (DIT) on air-fuel mixing, combustion and emission characteristics were explored. Simulation results showed that NG-DRE performance was better than DRE. During the entire air-fuel mixing process, NG movement was easily affected by the vorticity density due to its good diffusion characteristics, however its influence on diesel movement was relatively minimal. At assisted ignition timing, NG concentrated at the rear of the combustion chamber, and diesel concentrated at the front and middle of the combustion chamber. Delaying NGIT and DIT, the mixture became more concentrated due to a shorter mixing time. Moreover, the delayed NGIT and DU resulted in improvement of the pressure and combustion rate, while for a further delayed DIT the pressure was decreased due to the pressure negative work. Considering the engine power and emission performance, for dual-fuel injection schemes, 340 degrees CA BTDC and 70 degrees CA BTDC were the preferred application schemes for NG and diesel respectively. Their peak combustion pressure (P-max) increased by 16.34% and 27.38% respectively, but due to the richer mixture, soot value increased by 0.023% and 0.054% and CO (carbon monoxide) value also increased by 0.026% and 0.039% respectively.

AB Ventilation heat recovery is an important means of effectively reducing the energy consumption of buildings. The improve the performance of a heat pump heat recovery system under large temperature difference conditions winter, a triplex loop heat pump system, which contains three independent heat pump cycles, is proposed place of its single loop counterpart. Operating characteristics and system performance were analyzed while indoor temperature was constant at 20 degrees C and as outdoor temperature dropped from 15 degrees C to 20 degrees C. Result showed that with the decrease of the outdoor temperature, the mass flow rate and temperature effectiveness of the triplex loop heat recovery system decreased whereas the heating capacity and the coefficient of performanc (COP) increased. Under the experimental conditions, the COP of the triplex loop system had an advantage ove the traditional heat pump system when the outdoor temperature was below 2.5T. When the outdoor temperature was 20 degrees C, the COP of the triplex system could reach 9.33, which was 23.1% higher than that of th traditional system.

AB Ever-increasing energy requirements coupled with the desire to cope with global warming have motivated researchers to look for alternative energy resources. Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant renewable energy resource which can be exploited to reduce the dependency on fossil fuel resources. Acacia cincinnata and Acacia holosericea are fast-growing tree species which produce large quantities of biomass within short span of time and does not require major agricultural inputs to grow. This study is aimed at the intermediate pyrolysis process of Acacia cincinnata and Acacia holosericea species to produce biofuels such as bio-oil, biochar and gaseous product. Mass balance was done to calculate the yields of different products along with the characterisation of bio-oil and biochar produced. Experiments were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor at the pyrolysis temperature of 500 degrees C, heating rate of 25 degrees C/min and nitrogen gas flowrate of 100 cm(3)/min for the biomass feedstock having particle size between 0.5 and 1 mm. Comprehensive thermochemical characterisation of biomass samples was carried out prior to pyrolysis experiments. The chemical composition of bio-oil samples produced was determined using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC MS) technique. Ultimate analysis, calorific values, pH values and the ash contents in the bio-oil samples were also determined. Bio-oil produced were reported to be complex mixtures of heterocyclic and phenolic compounds resulting from the thermal degradation of basic components of biomass with the calorific values obtained in the range of 23A6-30.65 MJ/kg. Biochar samples produced in the study were characterised with the help of ultimate analysis, FUR analysis, calorific values, pH values and SEM and EDX analysis. Properties of blochars indicated suitability for energy as well as other applications such as soil remediation and adsorption purposes. Study revealed a decent potential of Acacia cincinnata and Acacia holosericea species as biofuels resources.

AB A 3D (three-dimensional) multi-phase model of PEMFC (proton exchange membrane fuel cell) is developed, in which the Eulerian-Eulerian model is utilized to solve the gas and liquid two-phase flow in channels, while the two-fluid model is adopted in porous electrodes. Hence, the surface tension, wall adhesion and drag force in channels are all included. Besides, the gravity effects in the whole PEMFC are also taken into consideration. It is found that the water vapor concentration in cathode channel at high inlet humidity (e.g. 1.0) will be much higher than the saturation concentration if neglecting the water vapor condensation. In addition, the liquid water condensed from vapor in channel is mainly blown to side walls, rather than only exist on the bottom surface. The effect of water condensation and evaporation in channel is found to be lower than that in porous electrodes because of the much higher gas velocity in channel. Besides, the partial low temperature is likely to cause local liquid water accumulation in both anode and cathode channels and porous electrodes. Meanwhile, the wave-like channel is found to be able to remove the liquid water effectively due to the enhanced convection effect. Meanwhile, the simulation results in this study show that the serpentine flow field is much more beneficial to the liquid water removal and reactant gas distribution than parallel flow field, which results in the much higher performance.

AB In the bid process, predicting whether the contractor will suffer a financial crisis during the construction project is vital to project owners and other stakeholders for identifying problems and taking strategic action. In this context, the models for predicting financial crisis of contractor have been extensively studied. However, the previous studies have been focused on predicting a financial crisis for one-quarter or one-year ahead of prediction point, even though the duration of projects are relatively long in the construction industry, usually exceeding one year. Moreover, despite the possibility of knowing the signs of financial crisis of a contractor through predicting financial distress, no attempt has been made to predict financial distress that contractor can suffer before reaching a financial crisis including highly visible legal events, such as bankruptcy, default, and delisting. This means that there is significant gap between those models and practical application in terms of the prediction period and definition of the financial crisis. This study proposes voting-based ensemble models that predict financial distress of contractor for two and three-year ahead of prediction point using a finance-based definition of financial distress. The prediction performance of proposed model was evaluated using financial statements of contractors in South Korea from 2007 to 2012. The proposed models showed area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.940 and 0.910 for predicting financial distress for each of the prediction years. By predicting financial distress of the contractor from the early stages of a construction project to the end stage with high accuracy, this model can help project owners and broad stakeholders to avoid damage due to financial crisis during a project.

AB Feature selection is a preprocessing step in many application areas that are relevant to expert and intelligent systems, such as data mining and machine learning. Feature selection criteria that are based on information theory can be generally sorted into two categories. The criteria in the first group focus on minimizing feature redundancy, whereas those in the second group aim to maximize new classification information. However, both groups of feature evaluation criteria fail to balance the importance of feature redundancy and new classification information. Therefore, we propose a hybrid feature selection method named Minimal Redundancy-Maximal New Classification Information (MR-MNCI) that integrates the two groups of feature selection criteria. Moreover, according to the characteristics of the two groups of selection criteria, we adopt class-dependent feature redundancy and class-independent feature redundancy. To evaluate MR-MNCI, seven competing feature selection methods are compared with our method on 12 real-world data sets. Our method achieves the best classification performance in terms of average classification accuracy and highest classification accuracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Most existing studies on routing guidance only paid attention to the average path travel time, which failed to consider travel time reliability (TTR) preferences by different travelers. In this study, a momentmatching-based hybrid genetic algorithm (MHGA) is proposed to search the reliable shortest path (RSP) in stochastic road networks with link correlations. First, the goodness-of-fit results based on field data reveal that lognormal distributions are more appropriate for characterizing link travel times. The impact of topological distance (measured by the number of links) and road type on link correlations is also scrutinized. Then, a moment-matching method (MOM) is utilized to determine the parameters of the approximate path travel time distribution (TTD) by accounting for link correlations. A local search algorithm is designed to improve the search ability of the path finding algorithm. In view of travelers' risk tolerance, the algorithm enables the provision of personalized routing guidance for individual travelers. Furthermore, to support path finding applications in a large-scale network, heuristic constraints are imposed to help reduce the computational workload and accelerate the convergence speed of the search process. Finally, numerical case studies based on synthetic networks and a real road network in Beijing are presented, and the results help demonstrate that the algorithm has good potential to solve RSP searching problems in a large-scale network with desirable efficiency.

AB In the last years social networks have emerged as a critical mean for information spreading bringing along several advantages. At the same time, unverified and instrumentally relevant information statements in circulation, named as rumours, are becoming a potential threat to the society. For this reason, although the identification in social microblogs of which topic is a rumour has been studied in several works, there is the need to detect if a post is either a rumor or not. In this paper we cope with this last challenge presenting a novel rumour detection system that leverages on newly designed features, including influence potential and network characteristics measures. We tested our approach on a real dataset composed of health-related posts collected from Twitter microblog. We observe promising results, as the system is able to correctly detect about 90% of rumours, with acceptable levels of precision. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Voice activity detection (VAD) is an essential task in expert systems that rely on oral interfaces. The VAD module detects the presence of human speech and separates speech segments from silences and non-speech noises. The most popular current on-line VAD systems are based on adaptive parameters which seek to cope with varying channel and noise conditions. The main disadvantages of this approach are the need for some initialisation time to properly adjust the parameters to the incoming signal and uncertain performance in the case of poor estimation of the initial parameters. In this paper we propose a novel on-line VAD based only on previous training which does not introduce any delay. The technique is based on a strategy that we have called Multi-Normalisation Scoring (MNS). It consists of obtaining a vector of multiple observation likelihood scores from normalised mel-cepstral coefficients previously computed from different databases. A classifier is then used to label the incoming observation likelihood vector. Encouraging results have been obtained with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). This technique can generalise for unseen noise levels and types. A validation experiment with two current standard ITU-T VAD algorithms demonstrates the good performance of the method.

AB The traces of past process executions are maintained in many contexts, since they constitute a strategic source of information. Different tasks on such data can be supported. In particular, we focus on process model discovery, by proposing an approach that helps the analyst in identifying a good balance between overfitting and underfitting. To achieve such a goal, we have designed SIM (Semantic Interactive Miner), an innovative interactive and incremental tool, which starts from a non-generalized model, and provides the user with a path retrieval facility to analyse the current model, and with semantic abstractions to build increasingly more generalized models (through the selective merging of retrieved paths). Additionally, the tool exploits the path retrieval facility and an indexing strategy to support efficient trace retrieval. As a consequence, our framework represents the first literature contribution able to integrate in a synergic approach process model discovery, path retrieval, and trace retrieval.
   We experimentally compare our tool to two well-known process mining algorithms, namely inductive miner (Leemans, Fahland, and van der Aalst, 2013) and heuristic miner (Weijters, van der Aalst, and de Medeiros, 2006). The comparison enlights the main innovative aspect of our approach, i.e., its ability to facilitate the analyst in directly using her/his domain knowledge to lead process model discovery, a feature that can be extremely advantageous in knowledge-rich applications, such as the medical ones.

AB Current methodologies for Information Systems (ISs) audits suffer from some limitations that could question the effectiveness of such procedures in detecting deviations, frauds, or abuses. Process Mining (PM), a set of business-process-related diagnostic and improvement techniques, can tackle these weaknesses, but literature lacks contributions that address this possibility concretely. Thus, by framing PM as an Expert System (ES) engine, this paper presents a five-step PM-based methodology for IS audits and validates it through a case in a freight export port process managed by a Port Community System (PCS), an open electronic platform enabling information exchange among port stakeholders.
   The validation pointed out some advantages (e.g. depth of analysis, easier automation, less invasiveness) of our PM-enabled methodology over extant ESs and tools for IS audit. The substantive test and the check on the PCS processing controls and output controls allowed to identify four major non-conformances likely implying both legal and operational risks, and two unforeseen process deviations that were not known by the port authority, but that could improve the flexibility of the process. These outcomes set the stage for an export process reengineering, and for revising the boundaries in the process flow of the PCS. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper characterizes a class of repeated moral hazard problem where the agent's replacement action is necessary for assuring the performance of important materials and equipment. However, due to the principal's costly monitoring, the continuously decreasing performance caused by the agent's successive shirking behaviors will significantly harm the principal's profits or welfare. For sake of performance assurance and monitoring efficiency, this paper adopts two reinforcement learning algorithms to find and test the strategies on the final path satisfying the conditions of (Restricted) Experience Based Equilibrium. Experimental results in a case of quality assurance of grain demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and the solution methods. Practically, this framework especially fits a kind of government-enterprise relation, such as in the field of emergency materials management and safety production management. Given the increasing need of developing systems for the government's management, this paper aims to provide applicable strategies and guidelines from a theoretical perspective. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Intelligent fault diagnosis has attracted considerable attention due to its ability in effectively processing massive data and rapidly providing diagnosis results. However, in the traditional intelligent diagnosis methods of bearing, features are extracted manually. Such process is not only a grueling and time-consuming work but also greatly affects the diagnosis results. In this study, we propose a new intelligent diagnosis method of bearing, which can learn features automatically. First, a new subset approach is developed and it is helpful to learn the discriminative features from different fault patterns. Second, a subset based deep auto-encoder (SBTDA) model is proposed to realize the automatic feature extraction. Additionally, a new self-adaptive fine-tuning operation is designed to ensure the good convergence performance of SBTDA. Finally, to obtain the appropriate configuration, several key parameters are optimized with particle swarm optimization algorithm. The proposed method is evaluated on three public bearing datasets, and achieves the average testing accuracies of 99.65%, 99.66% and 99.60% respectively. The comparisons with 13 intelligent diagnosis methods demonstrate that SBTDA can obtain higher diagnosis accuracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although advances in speech processing have facilitated the prognostic assessment of patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD), there is no objective method towards its early detection in a clinical setting. This study investigated the application of a novel hybrid Artificial Intelligence-based classifier for aiding early diagnosis of PD. Data on dysphonic measures and clinical scores on 68 subjects were obtained from the University of California-Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning database. Weights derived from a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were applied for feature selection and their moduli used to rank the input features based on their relative importance towards discriminating between physiological and pathological data patterns. Thus, the initial 27 features were reduced to 20 selected diagnostic factors. This reduced feature set was then input to a Lagrangian Support Vector Machine (LSVM) for classification. The overall performance of this hybrid feature-driven algorithm (MLP-LSVM) was thus compared against commercially available software and classifiers from similar studies. Results indicate an overall classification accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 100% for the proposed feature-driven algorithm (MLP-LSVM), with relatively faster convergence, thus demonstrating its potential for aiding early diagnosis of PD in a clinical setting.

AB With the rapid development of service-oriented computing and cloud computing, an increasing number of Web services have been published on the Internet, which makes it difficult to select relevant Web services manually to satisfy complex user requirements. Many machine learning methods, especially matrix factorization based collaborative filtering models, have been widely employed in Web service recommendation. However, as a linear model of latent factors, matrix factorization is challenging to capture complex interactions between Web applications (or mashups) and their component services within an extremely sparse interaction matrix, which will result in poor service recommendation performance. Towards this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel deep learning based hybrid approach for Web service recommendation by combining collaborative filtering and textual content. The invocation interactions between mashups and services as well as their functionalities are seamlessly integrated into a deep neural network, which can be used to characterize the complex relations between mashups and services. Experiments conducted on a real-world Web service dataset demonstrate that our approach can achieve better recommendation performance than several state-of-the-art methods, which indicates the effectiveness of our proposed approach in service recommendation.

Data collected from NHANES datasets from 2007 to 2016. An unbalanced sampling dataset of 19.709 with (83%) non-hypertensive individuals and (17%) hypertensive individuals. Some risk factors were categorized, and indicator variables were created to transform the continuous variables to a binary form to have consistent predictors with the outcome. The results show a sensitivity of 77%, a specificity of 68%, precision on the positive predicted value of 32% in the test sample and a calculated AUC of 73% (95% CI[0.70-0.76]). The model also confirms that individuals with obesity, age range between 71 and 80 years old, race non-Hispanic black and male have higher odds of having hypertension. Diabetes, kidney disease and smoking habits do not affect odds of the outcome. In clinical practice, this model can be used to inform patients and guide population health management in detecting patients with high probability of developing a cardiovascular disease. The proposed logistic regression method can be used as an expert system's inference engine to support the experts in the cardiovascular disease field to provide problem analysis for patients in risk of developing hypertension.

AB Large amounts of information and various features are in many machine learning applications available, or easily obtainable. However, their quality is potentially low and greater volumes of information are not always beneficial for machine learning, for instance, when not all available features in a data set are relevant for the classification task and for understanding the studied phenomenon. Feature selection aims at determining a subset of features that represents the data well, gives accurate classification results and reduces the impact of noise on the classification performance. In this paper, we propose a filter feature ranking method for feature selection based on fuzzy similarity and entropy measures (FSAE), which is an adaptation of the idea used for the wrapper function by Luukka (2011) and has an additional scaling factor. The scaling factor to the feature and class-specific entropy values that is implemented, accounts for the distance between the ideal vectors for each class. Moreover, a wrapper version of the FSAE with a similarity classifier is presented as well. The feature selection method is tested on five medical data sets: dermatology, chronic kidney disease, breast cancer, diabetic retinopathy and horse colic. The wrapper version of FSAE is compared to the wrapper introduced by Luukka (2011) and shows at least as accurate results with often considerably fewer features. In the comparison with ReliefF, Laplacian score, Fisher score and the filter version of Luukka (2011), the FSAE filter in general achieves competitive mean accuracies and results for one medical data set, the breast cancer Wisconsin data set, together with the Laplacian score in the best results over all possible feature removals.

AB Resources of an organisation (people, time, money, equipment, etc) are never endless. As such, a constant and continuous challenge for decision makers is to decide which projects should be given priority in terms of receiving critical resources in a way that the organisation's productivity and profitability is best guaranteed. Previous literature has already developed a plenitude of project portfolio selection methodologies ranging from simple scoring to complex mathematical models. However, most of them too often fail to propose one integrated and seamless method that can simultaneously take into account three important elements: (1) prioritisation of selection criteria over each other, (2) uncertainty in decision-making, and (3) projects interdependencies. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing an integrated method that can simultaneously address all these three aspects. The proposed method combines Quality Function Development (QFD), fuzzy logic, and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to accounts for prioritisation, uncertainty and interdependency. We then apply this method in a numerical example from a real world case to illustrate the applicability and efficacy of the proposed methodology. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Glaucoma is an asymptomatic disease caused by damage to the optic nerve due to elevated intraocular pressure. With early diagnosis, the chances of controlling progression are greater. Glaucoma is a major global health problem as a cause of blindness, second only to cataracts. This paper presents the development of a method for the automatic detection of glaucoma in retinal images using a deep learning approach together with the exploration of texture attributes through phylogenetic diversity indexes. The methodology employed is as follows: First, image acquisition is done from the RIM-ONE, DRIONS-DB, and DRISHTI-GS databases, followed by training the convolutional neural network for optical disk segmentation. After this segmentation, it is necessary to perform removal of the blood vessels after which feature extraction is applied to the images generated from the RGB channels and the gray levels. The extracted attributes are based only on the features of texture using phylogenetic diversity indexes. Classification was performed using an approach based on the convolutional neural network. The method proved to be promising, achieving accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 100%. The medical expertise developed by the proposed method proved to be robust and efficient for the automatic detection task of glaucoma through retinal image analysis, using image processing and computational intelligence techniques. We thus propose a specialist system through the construction of a complete CAD tool to integrate into real clinical environments, providing a second opinion on the diagnosis of glaucoma quickly, efficiently, and at low cost.

AB This paper proposed a modified version of Spider Monkey Optimization (SMO) algorithm for solving global optimization problems. The traditional SMO consists of seven phases where each phase has its characteristics and tasks to be performed. However, the local leader phase (LLP), that is the second phase of the SMO has the most significant effect on the performance of the algorithm. In which if it does not has good exploration and exploitation capability then the SMO might stick at a local point. Therefore, the proposed modified version of SMO (that called SMONM) used the transformations of the Nelder-Mead (NM) method to improve the ability of LLP. The proposed SMONM algorithm contains the same number of phases of the traditional SMO except the LLP that has modified through using the reflection, expansion, and contraction transformations of the NM. These transformations of NM worked if there is no improvement in the fitness function value after the solution is updating using the original LLP. The performance of the proposed algorithm has compared with other four algorithms namely, original SMO, Artificial Bee Colony optimization, Biography Based Optimization and Particle Swarm Optimization. A set of experimental series is performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm using 23 standard benchmark functions, 15 composite functions, and three classical engineering problems. The preliminary results show that the modified version of SMO has excellent ability to avoid the limitations of the tradition SMO algorithm, as well as, it provides better results than the other comparative algorithms regarding performance measures.

AB Pre-processing is the first step in text classification, and choosing right pre-processing techniques can improve classification effectiveness. We experimentally compare 16 commonly used pre-processing techniques on two Twitter datasets for Sentiment Analysis, employing four popular machine learning algorithms, namely, Linear SVC, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Convolutional Neural Networks. We evaluate the pre-processing techniques on their resulting classification accuracy and number of features they produce. We find that techniques like lemmatization, removing numbers, and replacing contractions, improve accuracy, while others like removing punctuation do not. Finally, in order to investigate interactions-desirable or otherwise-between the techniques when they are employed simultaneously in a pipeline fashion, an ablation and combination study is contacted. The results of ablation and combination show the significance of techniques such as replacing numbers and replacing repetitions of punctuation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   We provide a rigorous analysis that proves the optimality of our scheme under general conditions. Our solution resorts to a subtle aggregation procedure that drives the system towards equalizing the derivatives of the material value functions in a similar manner to the Homo Egualis theory. Furthermore, we report experimental results that catalogue the applicability of our solution to the problem of rate limiting in cloud computing, which falls under the deterministic NEFK problem.

ID POPULATIONS
AB In urban and transportation research, important information is often scattered over a wide variety of independent datasets which vary in terms of described variables and sampling rates. As activity-travel behavior of people depends particularly on socio-demographics and transport/urban-related variables, there is an increasing need for advanced methods to merge information provided by multiple urban/transport household surveys. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical algorithm based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and an Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure to obtain quasi-perfect marginal distributions and accurate multi-variate joint distributions. The model allows for the combination of an unlimited number of datasets. The model is validated on the basis of a synthetic dataset with 1,000,000 observations and 8 categorical variables. The results reveal that the hierarchical model is particularly robust as the deviation between the simulated and observed multivariate joint distributions is extremely small and constant, regardless of the sampling rates and the composition of the datasets in terms of variables included in those datasets. Besides, the presented methodological framework allows for an intelligent merging of multiple data sources. Furthermore, heterogeneity is smoothly incorporated into micro-samples with small sampling rates subjected to potential sampling bias. These aspects are handled simultaneously to build a generalized probabilistic structure from which new observations can be inferred. A major impact in term of expert systems is that the outputs of the hierarchical model (HM) model serve as a basis for a qualitative and quantitative analyses of integrated datasets.

AB Payment card fraud leads to heavy annual financial losses around the world, thus giving rise to the need for improvements to the fraud detection systems used by banks and financial institutions. In the academe, as well, payment card fraud detection has become an important research topic in recent years. With these considerations in mind, we developed a method that involves two stages of detecting fraudulent payment card transactions. The extraction of suitable transactional features is one of the key issues in constructing an effective fraud detection model. In this method, additional transaction features are derived from primary transactional data. A better understanding of cardholders' spending behaviors is created by these features. After which the first stage of detection is initiated. A cardholder's spending behaviors vary over time so that new behavior of a cardholder is closer to his/her recent behaviors. Accordingly, a new similarity measure is established on the basis of transaction time in this stage. This measure assigns greater weight to recent transactions. In the second stage, the dynamic random forest algorithm is employed for the first time in initial detection, and the minimum risk model is applied in cost-sensitive detection. We tested the proposed method on a real transactional dataset obtained from a private bank. The results showed that the recent behavior of cardholders exerts a considerable effect on decision-making regarding the evaluation of transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. The findings also indicated that using both primary and derived transactional features increases the F-measure. Finally, an average 23% increase in prevention of damage (PoD) is achieved with the proposed cost-sensitive approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The enzymatic browning reaction caused by polyphenol oxidase (PPO) has a negative effect on the processing of fruits and vegetables. However, some chemical inhibitors have been used to prevent enzymatic browning reaction, although they may be toxic and potentially hazardous to use in food. In this study, PPO was isolated and purified from the Whangkeumbae pear, and four food grade inhibitors were used to prevent the enzymatic browning reaction. The results showed that the PPO activity increased by 32.93-fold; its yield was 0.2 U/100 U, and the specific activity was 519,895.73 U/mg protein. The molecular weight of the PPO was approximately 44 kDa. The most potent inhibitor was L-cysteine, which fully inhibited the PPO activity at a concentration of 0.8 mg/mL. The type of inhibition of L-cysteine was noncompetitive. It suggests that L-cysteine can be utilized to prevent enzymatic browning reaction during the processing of pear juice.

AB A novel method for the simultaneous identification and quantification of twelve aminoglycosides (AGs) and two colistins in meat and bovine milk has been developed. The analysis was carried out using liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (LC-Q-Orbitrap). Among the HILIC (Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography) stationary phases tested, the bare silica Poroshell 120 provided the best results. The samples were extracted with an aqueous solution followed by an SPE clean up based on the weak cation exchange mechanism. The validation study was performed carrying out 72 experiments per matrix at six different concentrations in a range encompassing the Maximum Residue Limits. The recoveries were from 72 to 87% in meat (except colistins) and from 82 to 96% in milk. Repeatabilities and intra-lab reproducibilities were lower than 10 and 15%, respectively. Limits of detection were lower than or equal to 33 mu g kg(-1). Finally, test materials containing AGs prepared for interlaboratory studies were successfully analysed.

AB A new approach for producing gluten-free pasta from hydrated (50 degrees C, 20 min) rice kernels, skipping the grinding step, was explored. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was used to study the hydration kinetics of rice, by monitoring the time evolution of both proton density and water transverse-relaxation rate during water diffusion. Results showed that the optimal water diffusion was reached after 180 min, allowing the extrusion of hydrated rice kernels into pasta. MRI analysis also highlighted in cooked pasta gradients of water distribution and mobility, in agreement with the high shear force that was measured using the Kramer cell (1066.5 vs 896.4 N). The high hydration in the external layers of pasta did not negatively affect the cooking quality (cooking loss, compression energy, firmness) of the product. MRI analysis provided experimental evidence for the optimization of early steps in the technological process of grains for the production of gluten-free pasta.

AB Fe-transferrins/their homologues in ex-vivo mushrooms were identified by ESR spectroscopy at liquid helium temperature, 4 K. The ESR fine-structure signals from Grifola frondosa were analyzed by spectral simulation with a full spin-Hamiltonian approach, determining the spin Hamiltonian parameters of the ferric iron species bound in the biological environment: S = 5/2, g = (2.045, 2.01, 2.235), |D| = 0.28 cm(-1), |E/D| = 0.05. The zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameters, D-and E-values, are very close to the reported values, |D| = 0.25 cm(-1) and |E/D| = 0.06, for an Fe-transferrin with oxalate anion, and to |D| = 0.25 cm(-1) and |E/D| = 0.04 for one with malonate anion in human sera, suggesting that the Fe3+ species are from Fe-transferrins or their homologues. Quantum chemical calculations of the ZFS tensors for Fe-transferrins were carried out. Fe-transferrins/homologues have been identified for all the mushrooms under study, suggesting that such Fe3+ enzymes are widely distributed in mushrooms.

AB In this study, barley malt rootlets (BMR) were subjected to five different pre-treatments (steaming (220 degrees C), roasting (60 degrees C), autoclaving (121 degrees C), microwaving (160-800 W, 30-120 s) and enzyme treatment). Total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity of the BMR extracts were evaluated for both free and bound phenolics. The free phenolic content for non-treated extract was 1.8 mg/g of dry weight of BMR with 17.5% of antioxidant activity. Among the pre-treatments, autoclaving exhibited the highest values for free phenolics of 3.8 mg/g of dry weight of BMR and 71.6% of antioxidant activity. Pre-treatments did not show any effect on bound phenolic content, but increased antioxidant activity. The highest %DPPH activity for bound phenolics was observed for microwave treatment (160 W, 120 s) with 49.9%. Overall, pre-treatments significantly increased the free phenolic content of BMR phenolic extracts. Additional research is necessary to understand the phenolic profile and the thermal interactions of bound phenolic extracts.

AB The Australian marine mollusc Dicathais orbita has been identified as a functional food with potential for use in the prevention of colon cancer. This study investigated the effect of cooking on the biochemical profile of the edible flesh and extracts containing anticancer brominated indoles. The whelk flesh was high in protein (> 75 mg/100 mg dry weight) and there was a significant increase in protein and amino acids after cooking, associated with a loss of moisture and lipids. The flesh also has a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (> 49%), with omega-3: omega-6 around 1. The flesh contains unusually high levels of Docosapentaenoic acid and over 1000 mg/100 g serve of Eicosapentaenoic acid and Docosahexaenoic acid. Cooking resulted in a quantitative decrease in the bioactive compounds, however the main anticancer compound 6-bromoisatin can be retained after boiling. This provides evidence that cooking does not negatively impact the functional food properties of these muricids whelks.

AB Pectin is the methylated ester of polygalacturonic acid and has a wide range of applications. It can be used in food and animal feed as well as in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. Pectin is traditionally used as a gelling agent in fruit-based products, as a stabilizer in some fruit juices and milk drinks and fruit filling for bakery and confectionary products, but their potential applications differ according to their chemical composition. Therefore, at this stage of development, it is of a great importance to find fast, reliable methods to not only identify and quantify pectin, but also to determine its chemical structure and composition when it is extracted from plant matrices, wastes and by-products. The present review will focus on the analytical tools used to identify and quantify the amount of pectin obtained from plant matrices, wastes and by-products as well as determining its chemical and structural composition.

AB The foremost problem in carotenoid research is the excessive cost and difficulty of maintaining pure carotenoid compounds. This work presents an economical, efficient, and simplified one-step scheme for the purification of four major xanthophyll carotenoids from lettuce by utilizing preparative thin layer chromatography on Hyflo-Super-Cel: MgO (Heavy): calcium sulfate hemihydrate (9:9:2 w/w) based adsorbent. The mobile phase of acetone: hexane (1:1) provided the perfect separation of major xanthophylls, resulting in 95-96% purity afterjust single-step separation, with no interference from chlorophylls or other minor carotenoids. The identity of carotenoids was confirmed by absorption spectroscopy, chemical tests and APCI(+)-MS/MS. The proposed scheme can be used to isolate the carotenoids at the analytical and preparative scale. In anticancer studies, among four xanthophylls, 9-Z-neoxanthin was found most potent for reduction of cell viability of cervical (HeLa) and lung cancer (A549) cells, with IC50 values of 3.8 and 7.5 mu M, respectively.

AB The graded blends of coconut oil (CNO) and palm stearin (POs) phase behavior was studied in the present work, by using pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (p-NMR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray scattering (XRD). The kinetic phase diagram which was fitting to DSC data by polynomial equation (R > 0.95), indicated that the CNO-POs binary blends displayed monotectic behavior. The CNO-POs binary system displayed immiscible solid structures (beta and beta' polymorphism) with the addition of POs in the range of 10-60%, beyond which it showed miscible solid structures (beta polymorphism), respectively. Moreover, the presence of POs could elevate the liquid phase transition temperature and transform beta' polymorph into beta. These variations in phase behavior were reflected in the morphology of the binary blends. Our findings not only broaden the application of CNO and POs with novel attributes, but also direct the production of high quality non-hydrogenated fat-containing products.

AB Meat adulteration is one of the most common economic fraudulences in food industry. Current methodologies of meat source identification are complex, time-consuming and require sophisticated equipment. Hence, a simpler species specific method to determinate species is urgently needed. Here, we developed a novel method to visually identify the adulteration of meat using recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and SYBR green I (SG). At the isothermal temperature of 37 degrees C, RPA specifically identifies duck, chicken, cow, sheep and pig within 30 min of water bath. The RPA amplicons were successfully visualized by adding SG I. Furthermore, RPA can differentiate species of boiled, microwaved, high pressured or fried samples. Finally, using this system, we visually identified 1% pork adulterated in mutton or beef.

AB The characterization of 72 Italian honey samples from 8 botanical varieties was carried out by a comprehensive approach exploiting data fusion of IR, NIR and Raman spectroscopies, Proton Transfer Reaction - Time of Flight - Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) and electronic nose. High-, mid- and low-level data fusion approaches were tested to verify if the combination of several analytical sources can improve the classification ability of honeys from different botanical origins. Classification was performed on the fused data by Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis; a strict validation protocol was used to estimate the predictive performances of the models. The best results were obtained with high-level data fusion combining Raman and NIR spectroscopy and PTR-MS, with classification performances better than those obtained on single analytical sources (accuracy of 99% and 100% on test and training samples respectively). The combination of just three analytical sources assures a limited time of analysis.

AB This study deals with the preconcentrations of Ni(II) and Co(II) ions in real samples using the solid phase extraction method (SPE) before their determinations by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Thermophilic bacterium Geobacillus stearothermophilus SO-20 (Accession number: KJ095002), loaded with Amberlite XAD-4, was utilized as a novel biosorbent. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were employed for the investigation of the bacterial surface before and after Ni(II) and Co(II) biosorption. The experimental parameters were examined to find the best conditions. The retained Ni(II) and Co(II) ions on the biosorbent were eluted by using 5.0 ml of 1.0 mol l(-1) HCI as the best eluent. The sorption capacities were found to be 16.8 mg g(-1) for Ni(II) and 21.6 mg g(-1) for Co(II). It was also successfully used for the quantification of Ni(II) and Co(II) in a river water sample, some vegetables and soil.

AB Due to the great interest in obtaining natural bioactive carbohydrates to be used as functional ingredients, a selective microwave assisted extraction (MAE) method was optimized to ensure the exhaustive extraction of inositols and a-galactooligosaccharides (alpha-GOS) from mung bean. Thereafter, a comprehensive characterization of these compounds was carried out by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Apart from free inositols and a-GOS, several glycosyl-methyl-scyllo-inositols and glycosyl-inositols were detected for the first time in this legume. Under optimized MAE conditions (0.5 g dry sample, 2 cycles of 3 min, 50 degrees C, 10 mL 50:50 ethanol: water, v:v), bioactive carbohydrates yields were similar to those found using solid-liquid extraction (SLE), but with shorter analytical times. Concentrations of bioactive carbohydrates in MAE extracts from samples of different geographical origins ranged between 74.1 and 104.2 mg.g(-1) dry sample. MAE was proved a good alternative to SLE to obtain extracts enriched in bioactive carbohydrates.

AB A kanamycin molecular imprinted SPR sensor was prepared with 4-vinylbenzeneboronic acid as the functional monomer, polyethylene glycol acrylate and 2,2'-azo isobutyl amidine hydrochloride as the crosslinker and the initiator, respectively. Under optimum conditions, the response performance of the imprinted SPR sensor to kanamycin was evaluated. The imprinted sensor had a better imprinting effect and selectivity for kanamycin than the non-imprinted one. The linear range of imprinted sensor for kanamycin was from 1.0 x 10(-7) to 1.0 x 10(-5) mol/L (R-2 = 0.9941). Based on a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, the detection limits of kanamycin were 4.33 x 10(-8) mol/L for milk powder and 1.20 x 10(-8) mol/L for honey, with the RSD as 1.18% and 0.31%, respectively.

AB Cysteine proteases in pineapple (Ananas comosus) plants are phytotherapeutical agents that demonstrate antiedematous, anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and fibrinolytic activities. Bromelain has been identified as an active component and as a major protease of A. comosus. Bromelain has gained wide acceptance and compliance as a phytotherapeutical drug. The proteolytic fraction of pineapple stem is termed stem bromelain, while the one presents in the fruit is known as fruit bromelain. The amino acid sequence and domain analysis of the fruit and stem bromelains demonstrated several differences and similarities of these cysteine protease family members. In addition, analysis of the modelled fruit (BAA21848) and stem (CAA08861) bromelains revealed the presence of unique properties of the predicted structures. Sequence analysis and structural prediction of stem and fruit bromelains of A. comosus along with the comparison of both structures provides a new insight on their distinct properties for industrial application.

AB In this study, the feasibility of two sample treatments has been evaluated for the determination of seven neonicotinoid insecticides in honey from different botanical origins using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). A solid phase extraction with a polymeric sorbent (Strata((R)) X) is proposed for analyzing dark honeys, while a QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) approach is recommended for light honeys. Chromatographic analysis (6 min) was performed on a core-shell column (Kinetex((R)) EVO C-18). The proposed methods were fully validated using two different MS/MS systems: quadrupole-time-of-flight and triple quadrupole. The results showed that the best overall analytical performance was achieved using triple quadrupole, mainly due to its better sensitivity and the reduced influence of the matrix onto the analyte signals. The methods developed were applied to the analysis of commercial honey samples from different regions of Spain, as well as from experimental apiaries.

AB Binary blends of S. marianum-flower extract and chymosin, as coagulant preparations, enabled the manufacture of miniature cheeses with distinctive characteristics compared to those of chymosin-renneted cheeses. The physicochemical parameters, sensory attributes of the cheeses, and in-vitro water-soluble antioxidant activity were analyzed and compared to those properties obtained from control chymosin-renneted cheeses. The preponderant proteolytic constituent in the flower extract was isolated in a two-step-purification protocol. The thus purified aspartic peptidase was maximally active at acidic pHs and exhibited a preference for peptide bonds between hydrophobic residues. Enzymologic characterization revealed differences in the kinetic parameters and specificity compared to other enzymes employed, such as rennet. S. marianum-flower extract, as a source of peptidase with distinctive characteristics, is a suitable substitute for chymosin in miniature-cheese production. The addition of vegetable rennet contributed to the development of an intense aroma and conferred antioxidant activity to the cheeses and wheys.

AB A sensitive, fast, and inexpensive square wave voltammetric method using a cobalt phthalocyanine modified carbon paste electrode was developed for simultaneous determination of citric, lactic, malic and tartaric acids in fruit juices. To overcome the strong overlap of voltammetric signals caused by calibrated and uncalibrated constituents, multivariate curve resolution with alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) was used. Data were previous treated for correction of baseline and potential shift. The MCR-ALS calibration models were constructed and evaluated using a validation set obtained from a Taguchi design. The values predicted by the optimized MCR-ALS models were unbiased and no statistically significant difference was observed between proposed and reference methods, applying the paired t-test at a confidence level of 95%. As far as the authors know, a voltammetric method that simultaneously determines four organic acids in complex samples such as fruit juices without any previous pretreatment has not yet been reported in the literature.

AB There is no any doubt about the importance of food fraud control, as it has implications in food safety and in consumer health. Focusing on fruit beverages, some types of adulterations have been detected more frequently, such as substitution with less expensive fruits. A methodology based on attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform mid-infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and multivariate classification was applied to detect whether grape nectars were adulterated by substitution with apple juice or cashew juice. A total of 126 samples were obtained and analyzed. Two strategies were proposed: one-class and multiclass approaches. Soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and partial least squares density modeling (PLS-DM) were used to build the models. Among them, PLS-DA presented the best performance with a sensitivity and specificity of nearly 100%. The multiclass strategy was preferred if the adulterants to be studied are known because it provides additional information.

AB This study evaluated the effects of fermentation with pure cultures of Torulaspora delbrueckii (TD291 and TD70526) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (SP3796 and SP70572), as well as in sequential and mixed inoculations with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, on the chemical composition of bilberry wine. In comparison to the bilberry wines produced by pure and sequential fermentations, mixed cultures produced bilberry wines with more ethanol, higher pH values, higher percentages of red and yellow shade, but less glycerol and acetaldehyde. Higher values of color intensity and bluish parameter were found in products of pure fermentations with non-Saccharomyces yeasts. Compared to S. cerevisiae, T. delbrueckii contributed to the reduction of ethanol and acetic acid while increasing the content of succinic acid, lactic acid and higher alcohols; S. pombe consumed malic acid almost completely and produced more glycerol, acetaldehyde and/or pyruvic acid. Fermentation with SP70572 had the highest amounts of anthocyanins and hydroxycinnamic acids derivatives.

AB The six biogenic amines in sausage and cheese were analyzed by HPLC with UV detection after off-line derivatization with dansyl chloride, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl chloride, benzoyl chloride and dabsyl chloride, respectively. The results showed that both the off-line 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl and dabsyl derivatization were not suitable for HPLC analysis of biogenic amines when batch injection was used because the derivatives were instable, whereas both the off-line dansyl and benzoyl derivatization were suitable for HPLC analysis of biogenic amines when batch injection was used, but the latter needed to maintain the derivatives at 4 degrees C to ensure that benzoylated tyramine was not degraded when waiting for the analysis. The off-line dansyl derivatization had an obvious advantage in the analysis of biogenic amines in sausage and cheese samples by HPLC combined with batch injection because the method has a wider linear range and higher sensitivity, accuracy, precision and stability of the derivatives.

AB Consumers are increasingly looking for foods with attractive taste, easy preparation, quick consumption and nutritious. Avocado is a nutritional fruit that presents a preservation challenge to food industry. The development of powder blends using spray drying of avocado as a powdered drink is an attractive option that generates products with high nutritional value and stable. Two avocado formulations were spray dried using a design of experiments to assess the influence of drying conditions on powder blends. Results showed higher drying temperatures in combination with smaller droplets resulted in higher yields, lower residual moisture, lower water activity, and in smaller, less dense particles with color green. The inclusion of maltodextrin proved to be vital in preserving high contents of protein, ascorbic acid, and phenolic compounds at any drying conditions possibly due to hydrogen bonding stabilization of those compounds. Using a scalable and efficient drying process, avocado high nutritional value was maintained.

AB This study aimed to investigate the effects of a novel chitosan formulation (Kadozan) treatment on disease development, response of disease resistance, metabolism of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Peronophthora litchii-inoculated "Wuye" litchis. Compared with P. litchii-inoculated litchis, Kadozan-treated P. litchii-inoculated litchis exhibited lower fruit disease index, higher lignin content, higher activities of disease resistance-related enzymes (CHI, GLU and PAL), lower O-2(-) (center dot) generating rate and malondialdehyde content, higher activities of ROS scavenging enzymes (SOD, CAT and APX), higher contents of ascorbic acid and glutathione, and higher levels of reducing power and DPPH radical scavenging activity. These results suggest that Kadozan can be used to inhibit the growth of P. litchii in harvested litchis owning to the enhancement of disease resistance and ROS scavenging capacity, and decreases in O-2(-) (center dot) accumulation and membrane lipid peroxidation. Kadozan treatment can be used as a facile and novel method for suppressing postharvest pathogenic disease of litchis.

AB This study investigates the effects of catalytic infrared (CIR) dry-blanching (CIRDB) on the processing and quality of garlic slices. CIRDB processing parameters of CIR processing temperature, slice thickness and processing time were studied versus the processing characteristics of internal temperature, peroxidase (POD) activity and moisture reduction. Blanched garlic quality characteristics of surface color change (Delta E), allicin retention rate, vitamin C retention rate and microbial content were determined. Hot water blanching (WB) was used as a comparison. The results indicated that increasing CIR processing temperature and/or reducing the slice thickness accelerated internal temperature rise and POD inactivation and moisture reduction. To achieve 90% inactivation of POD, the CIRDB treatment resulted in moisture reductions of 15.87-40.37%, microbial reductions of 1.76-3.91-log, Delta E between 2.03 and 10.01, retention rate of allicin between 10.63 and 33.31%, and retention rate of vitamin C between 55.00 and 81.13%. CIRDB achieved the high-quality garlic products compared with WB.

AB The polyphenol composition and antioxidant activity of seven Australian-grown barley varieties were characterized in this study. UHPLC with an online ABTS system was used to identify individual polyphenols while simultaneously measuring their antioxidant activity. The Q-TOF LC/MS system was utilized to identify the phenolic compounds that demonstrated substantial antioxidant activity. The variety, Hindmarsh, showed the highest total phenolic content and antioxidant activity. There was no significant difference observed amongst the other varieties in their total phenolic content, however, they did have significant variation in proanthocyanidin content and antioxidant activity (p < 0.05). Prodelphinidin B3 was the most abundant polyphenol with the highest antioxidant activity amongst all the barley varieties tested. Other polyphenols identified with antioxidant activity included procyanidin, glycosides of catechin and flavan-3-ols. Polyphenol characterization of Australian grown barley varieties demonstrated that they have significant antioxidant activity, hence, promoting the value of whole grain barley as a potential functional food ingredient.

AB Wild mushrooms are gathered and consumed in many regions of the world. Edible mushrooms are a good source of valuable nutritious ingredients but they also are able to accumulate heavy metals from the environment. Participation of polysaccharide components of mushroom cell walls in biosorption is poorly understood, therefore, our investigations focussed on an alkali-soluble polysaccharide derived from the cell wall of Boletus edulis. Its chemical structure is described based on chemical analysis, GPC, NMR and FT-IR and other instrumental techniques. The polysaccharide contained mainly C-3 substituted alpha-D-glucose and alpha-D-mannose. The ratio between these components was 10:4. We postulate the polymer is a (1 -> 3)-linked alpha-D-glucan decorated by alpha- (1 -> 3)-D-mannose chains. The molecular mass of the polysaccharide was estimated at about 850 kDa. Biosorption of heavy metal ions (Cd, Cu, Zn and Pb) by the tested polymer was measured using AAS techniques. The polysaccharide has a high ability to accumulate lead and cadmium.

AB The study determined nitrogen compounds and amino acid profile in dry matter of potatoes differing in flesh colour, stored at 2 degrees C and 5 degrees C for three and six months. With increased storage time, the total protein content and particularly amino acid content declined. The coagulable protein content increased at three months' storage by 25%. The majority of the amino acid content decreased from 19 to 6% and from 38 to 21% after three and six months' storage, respectively. Storage temperature did not influence the coagulable protein content or serine, glycine, cysteine, tyrosine and phenylalanine. However, potatoes stored at 2 degrees C contained slightly more amino acids than tubers stored at 5 degrees C. Independently of the storage conditions, potatoes of yellow-fleshed Fresco and red-fleshed Herbie 26 varieties were characterised by a relatively high nutritive value, limited by leucine (CS = 84), methionine plus cysteine (CS = 78) and leucine (CS = 72), respectively.

AB Nucleotides, nucleosides, and nucleobases are important bioactive compounds. Recent studies suggested that they possess taste activity. However, it remains unknown about their presence in white tea and how they change during white tea manufacture. Here, we first established method based on hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-orbitrap ultra high resolution mass spectrometry (HILIC-Quadrupole-Orbitrap-UHRMS) platform, then applied it to study the dynamic changes of nucleotides, nucleosides, and nucleobases during white tea withering process. Five compounds, including adenosine 5'-monophosphate monohydrate (AMP), guanosine 5'-monophosphate disodium salt hydrate (GMP), adenosine, cytidine, thymine and uracil, were detected from withering samples. They showed a general decline trend during white tea withering process, however, considerable amount of them was retained after withering for 48 h except adenosine which was below detection limit after withering for 21 h. This study provided a complete picture about nucleotides, nucleosides and nucleobases changes during white tea withering process.

Total phenolic compounds (TP), proantocyanidins (PA), total flavonoids (TF), vitamin C and total antioxidant activity were analyzed. Five flavonoids (orientin, isoorientin, vitexin, isovitexin and hesperetin) were determined by HPLC-DAD, using calibration curves. Training system presented no effects on TP, PA, TF and antioxidant activity, whereas rainy season year 2 increased FRAP values, TF, orientin, isovitexin and hesperetin content, which could be associate to climate stressful condition leading to higher levels of these compounds.

AB This study investigated the apoptosis pathway mediated by apoptosis-inducing factors (AIF) and internal factors that influence the release of AIF. The results indicated that the AIF expression was decreased in mitochondria and increased in nucleus (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed in the AIF expression in mitochondria with caspase inhibitor treatment. The optical density of nucleus and mitochondrial swelling was significant increased (P < 0.05). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) fell gradually within the first 6 h and increased in the next 24 h. Calpain I activity was decreased, Ca2+ concentration, cathepsin B and D activities was increased (P < 0.05). The results demonstrated that AIF-mediated caspase-dependent pathway was a new mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and that mitochondrial swelling, ROS content, Ca2+ concentration, calpain I, cathepsin B and cathepsin D activities are the key influencing factors in apoptosis in postmortem bovine muscle.

AB Edible seaweeds are rich in chlorophyll pigments, although their modifications during cooking remain unknown. Consequently, the three most consumed seaweeds of different categories: Nori (Porphyra umbilicales), Sea Lettuce (Ulva sp.) and Kombu (Laminaria ochroleuca) were subjected to two cooking processes, boiling and microwaving. The chemical reactions of the chlorophyll pigments were determined by HPLC-UV/Vis. Besides the main chlorophyll transformations already described in fruits and vegetables (pheophytinisation and decarboxymethylation), the cooking of seaweeds caused a high level of oxidative reactions. Statistically, Nori was the most resistant algae to heating, while Sea Lettuce was the most labile seaweed. We report the thermal stability of c series for the first time, which were significantly less stable than a series in Kombu. Differences after microwaving and boiling methods depend mainly on the seaweed class. In conclusion, the seaweed structure is the main factor that determines the influence of cooking on the chlorophyll profile.

AB An accurate method for the analysis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in rice grain was developed using trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatization and stable isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. When this method was used with GABA-d(6) as an internal standard (IS), the observed GABA concentration was maintained at 100% of the initial concentration with increasing storage time of the vial in the autosampler. In contrast, when using ribitol as an IS and multiple injections from one vial or single injections from different vials, the observed GABA concentration was 85 and 113% of the initial concentration upon increased storage time, respectively. The improved method recoveries at two different spike levels were between 93.3 and 97.8%, with relative standard deviations of less than 3.3%. The GABA content of resveratrol-enriched transgenic rice was compared with that of its non-transgenic counterpart from two field sites, and statistically non-significant differences were observed between the two grains.

AB This study describes an optimisation and validation process on a method using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry to quantify furan in foods consumed mainly by infants and toddlers. The method that we developed allowed for low limits of quantification for liquid (1 mu g kg(-1)) and solid (2 mu g kg(-1)) samples. Our method was then applied to 134 food samples from the first French Total Diet Study on infants and toddlers. Furan was detected in 84% and quantified in 61% of the samples, at average lower and upper bound (LB/UB) concentrations ranging from 0 to 44 mu g kg(-1). The sugar and sugar derivatives, milk, growth milk, infant formulae and "other hot beverages categories contained the lowest average content (LB/UB <= 1 mu g kg(-1)) and breakfast cereals contained the highest (LB/UB = 44 mu g kg(-1)).

AB The study was designed to determine the relationship between chemical structure, bioactivity and pressure during the subcritical water extraction (SCW) of chamomile. Extraction was carried out at isothermal conditions (100 degrees C) at five different pressures (10, 30, 45, 60 and 90 bar). Twenty three polyphenolic compounds were identified in the extracts, whereby apigenin was found to be the dominant compound (61.53-1344.99 mg/kg). Results suggest that the lowest applied pressure has negligible effect on phenolic recovery from chamomile, but also the use of pressures above than 45 bar was proven as needlessly. By using in vitro assays, influence of pressure on antioxidant, cytotoxic and enzyme-inhibitory activities of the extracts was evaluated. Extracts obtained at 30, 45 and 60 bar exhibited stronger bioactivities than at 10 and 90 bar. It was concluded that pressure exert a significant influence on chemical composition of extracts, and thus on biological activity of chamomile extracts.

AB The bioavailability and oxidative damage toxicity of lead (Pb) in seven food matrices, including rice, milk, tomato, garlic, apple, kelp and pork, were determined using an in vitro digestion/Caco-2 cell model and a rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) oxidative damage model. Results showed that Pb bioaccessibility and bioavailability in the apple and kelp groups were significantly lower than other food matrix groups, with corresponding values of 11.05-28.31% and 1.57-8.81%, respectively. Oxidative damage assays showed that digestion products of apple polyphenol extract, which was selected from seven food matrices, could increase the oxidation resistance and the levels of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) by 32.23%, 39.02%, 27.14% and 30.90%, respectively. Additionally, malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels could be decreased by 59.66% and 40.21%, respectively. In conclusion, phenolics were an important food matrix that could decrease the bioavailability and oxidative damage of Pb.

AB Anthocyanin-rich cherries are known for preventing/decreasing risk factors associated with obesity; however, the specific benefits exerted by cherry non-anthocyanin phenolics are not clear. Obese diabetic (db/db) mice fed a diet supplemented with anthocyanin-depleted cherry powder (cherry) were compared to db/db (obese) or lean counterparts (lean) fed a control isocaloric diet for 12 weeks. The reduced plasma interleukin (IL)-6 and improved liver health may be mediated by cherry fibre and non-anthocyanin phenolics. Benefits for liver health included reduction of lipids and protein carbonyls, and modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)delta mRNA to resemble levels in lean. Lack of plasma antilipidemic, improvement of antioxidant defenses, and PPAR alpha/gamma mRNA modulation in liver suggest cherry anthocyanins specific benefits. This is the first study to elucidate in vivo the potential benefits of cherry non-anthocyanin phenolics for diabetes-induced liver disorders and the importance of choosing processing technologies that preserve anthocyanins and health benefits of whole cherries.

AB Anthocyanins (ANC) are hydrophilic and water-soluble polyphenolic plant pigments. The current barriers to successful application of ANC in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries are predominantly related to performance, stability, formulation properties, and color. Enzymatic acylation of ANC could increase their stability without compromising bioactivity and chromatic features. Lipophilization of ANC-rich blackcurrant skin extract with Candida antarctica lipase B and octanoic acid was selective to cyanidin and delphinidin glucosides, but not the corresponding rutinosides. The reaction was chemo- and regioselective for acylation at the primary alcohol of the glucose moieties, greatly facilitating separation of the different glycoside derivatives.

AB (-)-Epicatechin (EC) and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (0.001-5%) were found to reduce N epsilon-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) concentrations by up to 0.80 +/- 0.11 mM and 0.85 +/- 0.07 mM, respectively, as quantified by HPLC-MS during heating at 80 degrees C and 100 degrees C in a glucose-lysine model system at pH 5, 7 and 8, which mimic different food processing conditions. With the addition of 1 mM EC, the free CML concentration in coconut milk was reduced to 5.7 +/- 0.1 mu g/mL (similar to 2.8x10(-2) mM), which was significantly lower than that in unheated coconut milk (6.1 +/- 0.2 mu g/mL (similar to 3.0x10(-2) mM), p < 0.05) indicating that the free CML may be eliminated by the addition of EC in coconut milk. Products of EC/EGCG quinones reacted with CML by a Michael addition or Schiff base addition in model systems were tentatively identified by UPLC-ESI-MS/MS.

AB The antioxidant capacity in mango (pulp, peel, and seed) was measured using spectrophotometric and electrochemical methods in order to make traditional methods comparable with electrochemical ones, using reference standards Gallic Acid and Trolox. ABTS, DPPH, Total polyphenols, and electrochemical index were evaluated. In order to present the electrochemical results in a more comparable way, the voltammetric charge (using Differential pulse voltammetry) was used. Spectrophotometric methods allowed to determine the difference in contents of metabolites with antioxidant capacity, except in peel and seed, while the electrochemical method separated the three extracts and is not affected by interferences. Spectrophotometric methods present a good correlation with electrochemical methods, using the same reference standards, therefore, a better comparison between methods is possible.

AB A heating model system (HMS) of chlorogenic acid (CGA) and 20 amino acids was produced by heating at 120 degrees C for 4 h and evaluated for in vitro antioxidant and aldose reductase (AR). The CGA-glutamic acid (GT) HMS showed high in vitro antiradical activity indicated by ABTS(+) (82.37%) and DPPH radical scavenging (83.21%) as well as AR (83.21%) inhibition. The structure of the new compound was established by NMR spectroscopy, as methyl-3-(((E)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)acryloyl)oxy)-4,5-dihydroxycyclohexanecarboxylate (1) and 4-O-caffeoylquinic acid (2) from the CGA-GT HMS. The IC50 values of compound 1 for ABTS(+), DPPH and AR were 8.21, 56.97 and 3.68 mu M, respectively. These activities were similar to or higher than those of known positive controls (5.49, 63.58 and 13.60 mu M). We suggest that heat treatment generates novel CGA-GT HMS with increased antioxidant and AR inhibitory effects and contributes to the development of novel functional materials from CGA food products.

AB Up to 35% of (R)-methyl 2-methylbutanoate (M2MB) was observed in a beverage fermented with shiitake. As M2MB naturally occurs typically in high excesses of the (S)-enantiomer, the origin of the (R)-ester was elucidated by stable isotope labeled precursor-feeding studies. (R)-2-Methylbutanoic acid was identified as the main precursor in the substrate wort. Trace amounts of (R)-M2MB were produced by transformation of unsaturated secondary metabolites (tiglic aldehyde and tiglic acid) derived from L-isoleucine. Surprisingly, shiitake esterified (R)-2-methylbutanoic acid faster to (R)-M2MB than the corresponding (S)-enantiomer. Concurrently, spontaneous non-enantioselective degradation of M2MB occurred in shiitake. This explains diverse enantiomeric ratios of M2MB and different enantiomeric ratios of 2-methylbutanoic acid and M2MB in the beverage. As the odor threshold values of (R)-and (S)-M2MB differ significantly, these findings are of high relevance for the overall flavor of the fermented beverage and elucidate the discrepancy of enantiomeric ratios of 2-alkyl-branched acids and esters reported in nature.

AB Pulses are an important source of proteins, carbohydrates, and dietary fibre, and also contain polyphenols, which are bioactive compounds with antioxidant activity. A new analytical method that uses high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was developed for the quantification of sixteen polyphenols in thirty-one pulse varieties. Different extraction procedures were tested (acidic hydrolysis, alkaline hydrolysis and extraction without hydrolysis), and acidic hydrolysis at pH 2, extraction temperature of 20 degrees C and extraction time of 2 h was proven to be the best in terms of recovery percentages (99.7-107.6%). The highest polyphenol levels were found in beans, particularly black beans (459 mg kg(-1)) and ruviotto beans (189 mg kg(-1)); significant levels of polyphenols were also observed in lentils, particularly black lentils (137 mg kg(-1)) and quality gold lentils (132 mg kg(-1)). This study provides new information about legume polyphenols, offering reasons to promote legumes as part of a healthy diet.

AB In this work, lactose fatty acid esters were enzymatically synthesized from fatty acids and lactose using Candida antarctica B lipase (CALB) in organic solvents. Products were purified using a solvent extraction method and analyzed using ATR-FTIR and surface-active properties measurements. Results showed that hexanes and acetonitrile provide the highest conversions for both free and immobilized lipases, up to 77% and 93% respectively. The conversion rate of esterification is solvent-dependent for free lipase; the conversion rate of immobilized lipase still shows solvent dependency, but to a lesser degree. Surface tension, interfacial tension, critical micelle concentration (CMC), and contact angles were also measured for all of the samples, showing the potentials of these sugar esters as naturally derived surfactants for the food industry.

AB Two sample preparation methods were developed (graphitised carbon and C18 solid phase extraction clean-up) and validated in house using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for the determination of 30 pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) in salads, herbs, tea, herbals teas as well as tea infusion and icetea beverages. Total PAs concentration of samples purchased on the Belgian market varied greatly with matrix type ranging from < LOD to 187151 ng/g for dry samples, while for infusions and ice-tea beverages the highest PAs concentration was 2106 ng/mL. Surprisingly high PAs concentrations were detected in herbs and spices mixes. The infusion study indicated a transfer rate between 16 and 28% (except for monocrotaline) which highlights the overestimation of PAs concentrations in infusions when derived from a dilution factor (transfer rate of 100%) to the measured concentrations of the dry tea sample.

AB Oxidative deterioration is a major issue limiting the utilization of flaxseed oil (FSO). Present study explored the effects of hydrophilic (tannic acid), hydrophobic (alpha-tocopherol), and intermediate polarity (ascorbyl palmitate) natural antioxidants, which displayed highest DPPH radical scavenging and iron chelating abilities among several others, on the oxidative stability of FSO. A synthetic antioxidant (TBHQ) was also used as a control. FSO oxidation was examined by peroxide and p-anisidine values during 30-day storage at 25, 40 and 60 degrees C, and by accelerated oxidation using a rancimat at 110 degrees C. On mass concentration basis, all natural antioxidants were less effective than TBHQ. Irrespective of the polarity, all natural antioxidants, except alpha tocopherol, delayed primary and secondary oxidation, and increased the oxidative stability index. The alpha-tocopherol displayed pro-oxidant effect at all concentrations. Rather than polarity, antioxidant capacities, and their ability to replace minor components from the oil-water interface were crucial for the protection of FSO.

AB Multi-components of green tea from different origins were identified by UPLC-Orbitrap-MS/MS, including alkaloids, amino acids, catechins, flavones, flavone glycosides, phenolic acids and theaflavins. Quantitative chemical profiles of 72 samples of Yunnan green tea (YGT) and Hunan green tea (HGT) established the influence of origin on green tea. In addition, three variable selection methods, based on partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), were employed to screen characteristic components of YGT and HGT. The results of variable importance on projection (VIP) method showed better performance than coefficients beta and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for this dataset. Three characteristic components, named, gallocatechin gallate (GCG), epicatechin-(4 beta -> 8)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate, and vitexin were selected by VIP, with a correct rate of 98.61% and an AUC value of 0.9706. The results indicated that the combination of UPLC-Orbitrap-MS/MS and chemometrics could serve as a valid strategy to analyze complex analytical objects, such as green tea.

AB The influence of cyclodextrins (CDs) on the rheological and structural properties of kappa-carrageenan (kappa-CA) gel was investigated. Gelling temperature (T-g) of kappa-CA was improved by CDs present in the system. Variation of the Herschel-Bulkley model parameters indicates that the addition of CDs increases plasticity of the kappa-CA sol. Scanning electronic micrographs show that networks of kappa-CA become flat and firm after CDs were added. kappa-CA gel containing methyl-beta-CD shows the most uniform and fine network structure. Moreover, a proposed model of CDs in kappa-CA phase was provided. The influence of CDs on kappa-CA gelation was mainly through (i) the exclusion of CDs from kappa-CA in the sol state, (ii) the regular rearrangement of kappa-CA random coils influenced by CDs in the sol state, (iii) the binding of CDs to the kappa-CA surface by hydrogen bonds in the gel.

AB Impact of covalent and non-covalent binding interactions on physicochemical, structural, and rheological properties of waxy rice flour were investigated using several typical types of chemicals. Dynamic rheometer was used to investigate the viscoelastic properties and resistance to deformation or shearing. Both hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions were necessary for waxy rice flour to form a material with stable structure matrix. Besides this, X-ray diffraction pattern and pasting property measurements showed that the relative crystallinity and pasting viscosity values of waxy rice flour exposed to SDS and L-cysteine treatments increased whereas those of urea decreased compared with the control. Addition of acid, alkali, and NaCl might result in electrostatic forces, ion interactions, and indirectly change hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between starch and protein, which played a synthetic role on property changes of waxy rice flour.

AB Vicariance and/or long-distance dispersal shape the distribution patterns of many extant taxa, and orogenesis and/or climate fluctuations are key factors that drive the events of vicariance and/or dispersal. In this study, we yielded biogeographical inferences from Bayesian binary MCMC (BBM) analysis to explore the potential colonization histories of Opsariichthys bidens in China and to identify potential factors responsible for the colonization histories. Many vicariance and dispersal events were identified. The results suggested that O. bidens seemed to have originated from the Yangtze River and/or the Pearl River and experienced a Yangtze River-Pearl River split at 7.04 million years ago (Ma). BBM analysis revealed that the Pearl River populations had undergone expansions to the Hainan drainages, the Lancangjiang River (upper Mekong) and the Nanpanjiang River (upper branch of the Pearl River) at 0.74 Ma. Meanwhile, the Yangtze River populations expanded to the northeastern drainages during the Early Pleistocene. Subsequently, the northeastern drainages dispersed to the Yellow River during the Middle Pleistocene. More recently, the northeastern drainage populations also dispersed to the Huaihe River and back to the Yangtze River. A portion of the Pearl River populations originated from the Yangtze River dispersed to the Jiulongjiang River during the Middle Pleistocene. These time scales fit well with the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Pleistocene glacial cycles, indicating the two factors played vital roles in shaping the colonization histories of O. bidens.

AB Aims: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were associated with blood lipid levels in Europeans. However, little is known about such association in the Chinese populations. The present study was to determine the association of lipid levels susceptibility loci with the risk of China myocardial infarction (MI) patients.
   Methods: A total of 401 patients with MI and 409 controls were included in the study. Five SNPs (including HNF1A rs1169286 and rs2244608, C12orf43 rs2258287, LIPA rs2246833 and TRPS1 rs2293889) were selected using a tagging single nucleotide polymorphism (tSNP) strategy. The SNP genotyping work was performed using an improved multiplex ligation detection reaction (iMLDR) technique.
   Results: The subjects with rs1169286 CT genotype in MI cases had lower FBG levels than the subjects with rs1169286 CC/TT genotypes (P = 0.002). The subjects with rs2246833 TT genotype in MI patients had higher LDL-C levels than the subjects with rs2246833 CC/CT genotypes (P = 0.006). Several SNPs interacted with sex and age to modify TC, TG, LDL-C, CRE and FBG levels, and the risk of MI (P < 0.01 for all). However, our results disclosed no association between the SNPs and susceptibility to MI (P > 0.05 for all).
   Conclusions: Taken together, this study provides additional evidence that functional genetic variation of the lipid related mutations can mediate atherogenic processes and the risk of MI in humans.

AB In the current study, we aimed to examine the function of scutellarin on human osteoblast proliferation and osteogenic function. The results indicated that scutellarin enhanced osteoblast proliferation over a seven day period. This increase in cell proliferation was associated with corresponding increases in osteoblast activity, as measured by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) secretion, intracellular calcium ion influx, and calcium deposition. These anabolic effects were associated with C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) mRNA levels and protein induction. Knockdown of CXCR4 reversed the scutellarin-induced increases in cell proliferation, ALP activity, and calcium deposition. Furthermore, scutellarin increased p65 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, which resulted in the increased binding of phosphorylated p65 to the CXCR4 gene promoter region, to increase CXCR4 protein expression. p65 phosphorylation inhibition resulted in a decrease in CXCR4 protein expression. A p65 inhibitor blocked scutellarin-induced increases in osteoblast proliferation and function. Moreover, in a rat model of estrogen-deficient osteoporosis, scutellarin restored ovariectomy-induced bone loss in mice. Taken together, both cellular and animal models support the novel findings that scutellarin increased osteoblast proliferation and function through NF-kappa B/p65-mediated CXCR4 induction.

AB Casuarina equisetifolia L. is an important multi-purpose, fast growing and widely planted tree species native to tropical and subtropical coastlines of Australia, Southeast Asia, Malaysia, Melanesia, Polynesia and New Caledonia. It is a nitrogen-fixing tree mainly used for charcoal making, construction poles, landscaping, timber, pulp, firewood, windbreaks, shelterbelts, soil erosion and sand dune stabilization. Casuarina wood is presently used for paper and pulp production. Raw material with reduced lignin is highly preferred to increase the pulp yield. Hence, understanding the molecular regulation of wood formation in this tree species is vital for selecting industrially suitable phenotypes for breeding programs. The lignin biosynthetic pathway has been extensively studied in tree species like Eucalypts, poplars, pines, Picea, Betula and Acacia sp. However, studies on wood formation at molecular level is presently lacking in casuarinas. Hence, in the present study, the transcriptome of the developing secondary tissues of 15 years old Casuarina equiseitfolia subsp. equisetifolia was sequenced, de novo assembled, annotated and mapped to functional pathways. Transcriptome sequencing generated a total of 26,985 transcripts mapped to 31 pathways. Mining of the annotated data identified nine genes involved in lignin biosynthesis pathway and relative expression of the transcripts in four tissues including scale-like leaves, needle-like brachlets, wood and root were documented. The expression of CeCCR1 and CeF5H were found to be significantly high in wood tissues, while maximum expression of CeHCT was documented in stem. Additionally, CeTUBA and CeH2A were identified as the most stable reference transcript for normalization of qRT-PCR data in C. equisetifolia. The present study is the first wood genomic resource in C. equisetifolia, which will be valuable for functional genomics research in this genus.

AB The chloride channel (CLC) protein family, which includes both chloride (Cl-) channels and chloride/proton (Cl-/H+) antiporters, is present in all domains of life, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. However, there are no reported studies about this gene family in tobacco, an economically important global crop plant. In this study, we identified seventeen CLC genes in the genome of Nicotiana tabacum. A multiple sequence alignment showed that all of the predicted proteins shared a high sequence similarity and had a highly conserved GKxGPxxH motif. A gene structure analysis revealed that the NtCLC genes had highly divergent intron-exon patterns. A phylogenetic and conserved motif analysis revealed that the NtCLC family was divided into two clades, in a manner similar to other plants. We also evaluated the expression patterns of these NtCLC genes in different tissues and in plants treated with salt stress. The NtCLC genes had highly variable expression patterns, for example, the largely stem- and bud-specific expression patterns of NtCLC6 and NtCLC8, respectively. Salt stress treatment (300 mM NaCI) induced the expression of NtCLC2, NtCLC3, and NtCLC12, suggesting that these genes might play a role in tobacco responses to salt stress. Furthermore, the concentration of Cl- in the NtCLC2- and NtCLC13-silenced plants showed an obvious lower and higher level, respectively, than the control plants. Thus, we indicated that NtCLC2 or NtCLC13 might play an important role in chloride transport or metabolism in tobacco. Together, these findings establish an empirical foundation for the further functional characterization of the NtCLC genes in tobacco.

AB Mutton consumption is less popular in many Asian countries including Indonesia, whose consumers often complain about the unpleasant flavour and odour of the meat. The main causes of mutton odour are the two compounds of branched chain fatty acid (BCFA): methylnonanoic (MNA), phenol, 3-methyl (MP), 4-methylnonanoic (MNA) and 4-ethyloctanoic (EOA) present in all the adipose tissue; and the 3-methylindole (MI) or skatole and indole, which are originated from pastoral diets. It is crucial to understand the genetic mechanism of mutton odour and flavour (MOF) to select sheep for lower BCFA and indole thus reduce the unpleasant flavour of meat. The aim of the present study was to investigate transcriptome profiling in liver tissue with divergent MOF using RNA deep sequencing. Liver tissues from higher (n = 3) and lower (n = 3) MOF sheep were analysed using Illumina HiSeq 2500. The total number of reads produced for each liver sample ranged from 21.37 to 25.37 million. Approximately 103 genes were differentially expressed (DEGs) with significance level of p-adjusted value < 0.05. Among them, 60 genes were up-regulated, and 43 were down-regulated (p < 0.01, FC > 1.5) in higher MOF group. Differentially regulated genes in high MOF liver samples were enriched in biological processes such as cellular response to chemical stimulus and endogenous stimulus; cellular components such as such as basement membrane and extracellular matrix; and molecular functions such as haeme binding and oxidor-ductase activity. Among the DEGs, metabolic phase I related genes belonging to the cytochrome P450 CYP2A6 were dominantly expressed. Additionally, phase II conjugation genes including UDP glucuronosyltransferases UGT2B18, sulfotransferase SULT1C1, and glutathione S-transferase GSTM1 were identified. The dominant candidate genes for SOF could be cytochrome P450, sodium-channel protein, transmembrane protein, glutathione transferase, UDP glucuronosyltransferases and sulfotransferase. Pathway analysis identified steroid hormone biosynthesis and chemical carcinogenesis by cytochrome P450 pathways which may play important roles in MOF-related molecules metabolism. This work highlighted potential genes and gene-networks that may affect meat off flavour and odour in sheep.

AB Exosomes have been demonstrated as an important factor to influence cancer invasion and metastasis. Previous studies have shown that CXC chemokine recepter-4 (CXCR4) and stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha (SDF-1 alpha) mediates matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) secretions to facilitate lymph node metastasis of hepatocarcinoma cells. In this study, we demonstrated that exosomes containing elevated CXCR4 from high lymph node metastatic mouse hepatocarcinoma Hca-F cells were able to promote the migration and invasion of a paired syngeneic Hca-P cells that have low metastatic potential. Such impact on enhanced migratory and invasive capacities of Hca-P cells was triggered by the internalization of exosomes isolated from Hca-F cells. This was possibly due to the horizontal transferring of CXCR4 via exosomes. The lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) increased the migration and invasion of Hca-F cells probably by expressing SDF-1 alpha which bound with CXCR4 in the Hca-F cells and subsequently enhanced the secretions of MMP-9, MMP-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C). Exosomal CXCR4 from Hca-F cells promoted LECs proliferative rate and lymphatic tube formation ability. Our findings suggest that horizontal transfer of exosomal CXCR4 can promote murine hepatocarcinoma cell migration, invasion and lymphangiogenesis, and exosomal CXCR4 might be a novel therapeutic target against tumor lymphatic metastasis.

AB Stenopodidea Claus, 1872 (Crustacea: Decapoda) is one of the major groups of decapods crustaceans. Hitherto, only one complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) from the family Stenopodidae is available for the infraorder Stenopodidea. Here, we determined the complete mitogenome of Spongiocaris panglao de Grave and Saito, 2016 using Illumina sequencing, representing the first species from the family Spongicolidae. The 15,909 bp genome is a circular molecule and consists of 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes and one control region. Although the overall genome organization is typical for metazoans, the mitogenome of S. panglao shows some derived characters. A + T content of 77.42% in S. pamglao mitogenome is second-highest among the dacapods described to date. The trnR gene exhibit modified secondary structure with the T psi C loop completely missing, which might be a putative autapomorphy of S. pamglao mitogenome. Compared with the shallow-water stenopodidean species S. hispidus, the control region of S. pamglao exhibits three characteristics: larger size, higher A + T content, and more tandem repeat sequences. The gene order exhibited difference from the ancestral mitogenome pattern of the Pancrustacea, with 5 tRNA genes rearrangement. The result from BI was agreed with most morphological characters and molecular evidences, revealing that Stenopodidea and Reptantia had the closest relationship, as the sister group of Caridea. Still, the alternative hypothesis supported from ML topology cannot be completely rejected based on the current data. Estimated times revealed that the two stenopodideans families Stenopodidae and Spongicolidae diverged from each other around 122 Mya. The divergence time of spongicolid shrimp is in good agreement with the origin of their hexactinellid hosts (78-144 Mya).

   METAANALYSIS
AB Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a reproductive disease which affects 1 in 100 under 40 years women. FMR1 premutation carriers of CGG repeats are supposed to be at increased risk for POF. We have examined the 5'UTR region of the gene to find any association between the repeat size and the disease etiology in Iranian population. 30 women with early idiopathic POF and 30 fertile control women were selected. We used triplet repeat primed PCR (TP PCR) assay and gene-specific primers to amplify the CpG Island of FMR1 gene promoter region. The amplification results were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis and Gene Marker software. Among 30 patients, two had intermediate repeat size, one had premutation and the rest had CGG repeat of the normal range. Two of controls had intermediate repeats and none had a premutation. Two groups had significant differences in the repeat number average (p = 0.007) and in the average length of the smallest allele (p < 0.001), but had no promising difference in average length of the longest allele (p = 0.453).
   Although the two groups showed a significant difference in the length of alleles, their length was within normal range. Perhaps the polymorphism, in connection with the genome's entire network, has been involved in the development of the disease, or there has been a fundamentally different mechanism for the disease in Iranian population. A larger number of Iranian POF patients should be investigated for any probable relationship between the CGG triplet repeat length and the etiology of the disease.

AB Since the functional recovery of the reconstructed bladder is related to the bladder wall contraction and existing therapies do not respond to this, tissue engineering could be worth considered promising candidates for developing of conventional treatments in these kinds of ailments. Due to the low mechanical properties of natural scaffolds, biocompatible synthetic scaffolds can play a key role in the stem cells proliferation and differentiation and apply for many tissue-engineering applications. On the other hand, considering the low shelf life of TGF beta, encapsulating this growth factor can help maintain its functionality throughout the study period. In this study, poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofibrous scaffolds were fabricated through electrospinning method with or without chitosan nanoparticles loaded TGF beta. All scaffolds characterized morphologically by using SEM, TGF beta release profiling as well as biocompatibility by using SEM and MTT assays. Adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) was isolated and characterized immediately and the differentiation of SMC was investigated when cultured on the surface of the scaffolds and tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) as a control of gene and protein expression levels. Fabricated scaffold possess smooth structure with nanoscale size and long time releasing of sustained profiles. MTT, qRT-PCR and immunocytochemistry results demonstrated that AT-MSCs proliferation rate and SMC differentiation potential were significantly increased when cultured on the PVDF-TGF beta scaffold in comparison with PVDF and TCPS. According to the results, PVDF-TGF beta as a bio-functional scaffold can provide greater treatment possibilities in bladder tissue engineering applications.

AB Jaboticaba is a grape-like fruit that accumulates high levels of anthocyanins in the peel and is proposed as a good source of functional pigments. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying anthocyanin accumulation in jaboticaba peel remains to be elucidated. In this study, we employed RNA-seq technique to compare the transcriptomic differences between green-colored and black-colored jaboticaba peels. Over 5 million high-quality reads were assembled into 62,190 unigenes with an average length of 737 bp, 29,320 (47.15%) of them were annotated by public databases. 2152 unigenes were found to be differentially expressed (830 upregulated and 1322 downregulated). Gene ontology analysis and pathway enrichment annotation revealed that 18 differentially expressed genes encode phenylalanine ammonialyase, 4-coumaroyl:CoA-ligase, chalcone synthase, flavanone 3-hydroxylase, flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase, anthocyanidin synthase, UDP-glucose: flavonoid 3-O-glucosyl-transferase, glutathione S-transferase, Cytochrome b5 were associated with anthocyanin biosynthesis. Additionally, 54 differentially expressed transcription factors were identified. Furthermore, the expression of genes involved in biosynthesis and signal transduction of ethylene and abscisic acid were negatively and positively correlated with that of anthocyanin pathway genes and anthocyanin accumulation, respectively. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis of candidate genes showed trends similar to those in the RNA-seq analysis. McMYB, a homolog of AtMYB113, induced anthocyanin accumulation in tobacco leaves when coinfiltrated PsbHLH3. These results will contribute to further understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating anthocyanin accumulation in jaboticaba peel.

AB As an important epigenetic modification DNA methylation is catalyzed by DNA methylation transferases (DNMTs) and occurs mainly in CpG islands. DNA methylation plays an important role in regulates gene expression, cell differentiation, genetic imprinting and tumor therapy. Retinoic acid-binding proteins (RAC) is vital for the absorption, transport, metabolism and maintenance of homeostasis of retinoic acid, which in turn regulates the differentiation and proliferation of cells by regulating the transcription of many target genes, therefore, these proteins influence differentiation and proliferation of adipocytes and muscle fibroblasts. Thus, cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2 (CRABP2) may be a candidate gene which affects beef quality, yield and fat deposition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression and the methylation pattern on the differentially methylated region (DMR) of the promoter of CRABP2. The DNA methylation pattern was tested by bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction (BSP), the quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was used to analysis the expression of CRABP2 gene. The results showed that the DNA methylation level was higher in purebred cattle breed than that in hybrid cattle breeds which was negative correlation with the expression of the gen. These results indicate that the methylation status of the CRABP2 DMR can regulate mRNA expression. What's more, there are different methylation and expression patterns in different breeds and tissues which may influence the phenotype, and the results may be a useful parameter to investigate the function of CRABP2 in muscle and fat developmental in Chinese cattle.

AB Cotton is one of the most important economic crops and its production is influenced by various adverse factors. Boll shedding at an inappropriate period causes the severe loss of cotton yield. Ethephon can promote the formation of abscission layer cells, resulting in boll shedding. To genome-widely investigate the differentially expressed miRNAs involved in the formation of abscission layer cells, two sRNA libraries were constructed using abscission tissues of cotton pedicels treated with ethephon or water. A total of 55,264,755 and 59,069,866 clean reads were generated in two libraries. 460 mature miRNAs were identified, including 301 known miRNAs and 159 novel miRNAs. Among them, one known gra-MIR530b and seven novel miRNAs (gar-novel-miR88-3p/granovel-miR8-3p, gar-novel-miR16-5p, gar-novel-miR100-3p, gar-novel-miR75-3p/gra-novel-miR92-3p,gar-novel-miR32-5p/gra-novel-miR30-5p, gar-novel-miR9-5p and gra-novel-miR61-3p) were expressed differentially in abscission tissues. Seven-two genes were predicted as potential targets of the eight miRNAs. Gene ontology (GO) analyses revealed that most of these target genes are auxin response factors (ARFs), GTPase activators, and the regulators of oxidative phosphorylation and photosynthesis. Hence, we speculate that these miRNAs might regulate cell separation and aging to affect the formation of bscission layer cells. Our findings will provide a new insight into the regulatory mechanism of miRNAs involved in boll shedding.

AB Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most prevalent subtype of kidney cancer. Recently, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and its cell surface receptor, NGALR, have been reported to play critical roles in various tumors. However, the expression pattern and biological involvement of NGAL and NGALR in ccRCC remain unclear. In this study, we performed systematic analyses of 22 ccRCC data sets to characterize the expression patterns of NGAL and NGALR. The expression levels of NGAL and NGALR were significantly down-regulated in ccRCC samples in most of the data sets and the merged data set by meta-analysis. Furthermore, we also investigated the correlations between the expression of these two genes and their clinical associations with prognoses of ccRCC patients. Using integrated analyses of multiple ccRCC data sets, co-expression genes for NGAL and NGALR were identified. In addition, the sub-network analyses and biological pathway enrichment analyses were performed based on these co-expression genes. Finally, an activity score matrix for 23 pathways was constructed and confirmed as clinical prognostic signatures for ccRCC. Taken together, these findings determined the expression levels of NGAL and NGALR in ccRCC tumors, and provided the basis for a further examination of their biological roles.

AB Wintersweet (Chimonanthus praecox (L.)), with an over-one-thousand-years long history in cultivation, is still a popular ornamental woody plant in China. The tepals of wintersweet flower are waxy in nature and the overall color of the flower is yellow, while the inner tepals range from yellow to red, which makes it an ideal plant to study floral color formation in ornamental shrubs. In our current work, HPLC analysis revealed that the principal pigments in tepals were the metabolite of flavonoids. All the tepals were containing quercetin, kaempferol 3-O-rutinoside and rutin while cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside were only found in the in the red tepals. Moreover, we found the rutin as the principal component of all the pigments revealed. As well as in this study, a reference transcriptome library constructed from two varieties H29 and H64 flower. Further, 30 proteins of flavonoid biosynthesis pathway were identified in H29 flower using proteome analysis. Based on these dataset, the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was also speculated. After quantitative analysis of gene expression, we found that ANS act as an on-off switch for the accumulation of red pigments and had positive correlations with various steps genes of the flavonoid pathway. This expression profiling demonstrates that no gene products compete for common substrates to redirect the metabolic flux in wintersweet. It is also demonstrated that high expression of F3'H would provide sufficient content of the precursor, dihydroquercetin, for both flavonol and anthocyanin biosynthesis. The results help us to deepen and enrich the gene resource of color formation in wintersweet flower, and provide specific breeding strategies for increasing diversity of flower color.

AB Melanoma is an aggressive skin carcinoma with poor prognosis. Increasing studies have been carried out to investigate effective therapeutic targets for melanoma treatment. This study focuses on the LncRNA UCA1 and its downstream regulated factors. In our present study, UCA1 expression was discovered to be up-regulated while miR-185-5p expression was down-regulated in melanoma tissues and cell lines. We found that miR-185-5p could directly bind to UCA1 at the miRNA recognition site, and there existed a negative relationship between UCA1 and miR-185-5p. Additionally, knockdown of UCA1 was found to suppress cell invasion through inhibiting EMT in melanoma. However, miR-185-5p inhibitor transfection counteracted the inhibitory effect of UCA1 shRNA on cell invasion and EMT, suggesting that UCA1 shRNA suppressed invasion through inhibiting EMT via up-regulating miR-185-5p expression in melanoma. In addition, depletion of UCA1 decreased the expression of beta-catenin and c-myc, indicating that UCA1 shRNA suppressed WM/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover, activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway by Lid treatment could abolish the effects of UCA1 shRNA on melanoma cells mobility and EMT. Finally, in vivo experiments revealed that knockdown of UCA1 inhibited tumor growth and invasion via targeting miR-185-5p through Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. In conclusion, our study indicated that the UCA1/miR-185-5p/Wnt/beta-catenin axis might provide a new potential therapeutic strategy for melanoma treatment.

AB Really interesting new gene finger protein (RING) finger protein 121 (RNF-121) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the regulation of several signaling pathways. Among those signaling pathways, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway is known to play a critical role in tumorigenesis. However, the relevance between RNF121 and cancer development remains poorly understood. In this study, we found that RNF121 was less expressed in tumor tissues than adjacent normal tissues of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients. Overexpression of RNF121 inhibited the growth of human RCC cells (768-O cell line) in vivo. Moreover, RNF121 impeded the proliferation, migration and invasion of human RCC cells in vitro. In addition, we found that RNF121 activated NF-kappa B signaling pathway via promoting I kappa B alpha degradation in human RCC cells. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of RNF121 in RCC development, and provide new insights into RCC prognosis and therapy.

AB Although cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been extensively studied as an approach to deliver anti-cancer drugs into the tumor cells for the last 30 years, no FDA-approved CPP-based drugs are available, implying that the existing CPPs may have less efficiency in human or have side effects such as toxicity. Herein, we established a tumor targeting drug delivery system by attaching a human-derived cell-penetrating peptide dNP2 (CKIKKVKKKGRKKIKKVKKKGRK) to N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer doxorubicin conjugates. Firstly, in vitro cytotoxicity of free dNP2 peptide and dNP2-modified blank HPMA copolymer were examined. A classic CPP-R8 (CRRRRRRRR) was chosen for comparison and the results showed that 200 mu M free R8 reduced cell viability to 68.4% but dNP2 did not induce any toxicity at the same concentration. After conjugation to HPMA copolymer, a similar trend was also observed which indicated the excellent biocompatibility of dNP2. Next, effect of dNP2 modification on cellular uptake, DNA damage, apoptosis and anticancer activity of HPMA copolymer doxorubicin conjugates were evaluated. It was excited that dNP2 modified HPMA copolymer (P-( dNP2)-DOX) not only had a higher uptake by HeLa cell compared with non-modified copolymer (P-DOX) but resulted in an enhanced drug distribution in nuclei. Furthermore, P-(dNP2)-DOX exhibited greater DNA damage ability (10.5 folds higher than P-DOX) in comet assay and induced more apoptosis cells (46.0%). P-(dNP2)-DOX also showed a stronger cell cytotoxicity (3-fold to P-DOX) as well as in 3D tumor spheroid assay (inhibition rate 78%). All these results suggested that the human-derived cell-penetrating peptide dNP2 could facilitate tumor nuclear-accumulation of anti-cancer drugs and improve anticancer efficacy. More importantly, dNP2 has less toxicity compared with classic CPP-R8 thus shows the potential for the clinic cancer therapy.

AB Transfersomes were prepared by using different polysorbates (i.e., Tween 20, 40, 60 and 80) and loaded with tocopherol acetate, a naturally-occurring phenolic compound with antioxidant activity. The vesicles showed unilamellar morphology, small size (similar to 85 nm), low polydispersity index (<= 0.27), and high entrapment efficiency, which increased as a function of the length of the Tween fatty acid chain (from 72% to 90%). The longterm stability of the formulations was evaluated by means of the Turbiscan (TM) technology, which indicated their good stability, irrespective of the Tween used. The vesicles efficiently delivered tocopherol to the skin, and showed biocompatibility in vitro in keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Regardless of the Tween used, the transfersomes were able to protect skin cells from the oxidative damage induced by hydrogen peroxide. Additionally, transfersomes promoted cell proliferation and migration, which resulted in an acceleration of skin wound closure. These results demonstrated that tocopherol-loaded transfersomes bear potential as topical delivery system with antioxidant activity and wound healing properties.

AB This work demonstrates the feasibility of the extemporaneous preparation of maltodextrins orodispersible films (ODF) by hot-melt ram-extrusion 3D printing. This method consists of three simple technological operations which can be also implemented in a pharmacy setting. First, maltodextrins, drug, and other excipients are mixed in a mortar and wetted with the plasticizer (i.e. glycerine). Then, the mixture is fed in the chamber of the ram-extruder and heated. ODF are individually printed on the packaging material foil and sealed without further manipulations. The critical formulation attributes and process variables were investigated to define the processability space. In particular, the optimal conditions to print a mixture of maltodextrins/glycerine in a 80/20 w/w ratio resulted: heating temperature: 85 degrees C; needle gauge: 18 G; needle-packaging material foil distance: 0.6 mm; maximum print rate: 50 mm/s; filling angle: 120 degrees. The maximum drug loading was about 40%, when paracetamol was used as model drug. The compounded ODF complied with USP and Ph. Eur. specifications for disintegration time (< 1 min). The dissolution pattern of paracetamol overlapped with that obtained from ODF with a similar composition prepared by the consolidated solvent casting technique, demonstrating the suitability of the proposed technology.

AB The assessment of drug-combinations for pancreatic cancer treatment is usually performed in 2D cell cultures. In this study, the therapeutic effect and the synergistic potential of a particular drug-combination towards 2D and 3D cell cultures of pancreatic cancer were compared for the first time. Thus, the effect of Doxorubicin: Resveratrol (DOX:RES) combinations (at molar ratios ranging from 5:1 to 1:5) in the viability of PANC-1 cells cultured as 2D monolayers and as 3D spheroids was analyzed. The results showed that the cells' viability was more affected when DOX: RES combinations containing higher contents of RES (1:2-1:5 molar ratios) were used. This can be explained by the ability of RES to reduce the P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated efflux of DOX. Further, it was also revealed that the synergic effect of this drug combination was different in 2D and in 3D cell cultures. In fact, despite of the 1: 4 and 1: 5 DOX: RES ratios being both synergistic for both types of PANC-1 cell cultures, their Combination Indexes (CI) in the monolayers were lower than those attained in spheroids. Overall, the obtained results revealed that the DOX:RES combination is promising for pancreatic cancer treatment and corroborate the emergent need to evaluate drug combinations in 3D cell cultures.

AB Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common brain tumor; however, no effective treatment for it is available yet. Monocarboxylate transporters, which are highly expressed in GBM, play a role in transporting antitumor agents, such as 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA). Valproate, primarily used to treat epilepsy, has been considered a possible treatment option for malignant GBM. In this study, we aimed to investigate the combined effects of 3-BrPA and valproate on GBM cell growth and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Valproate enhanced 3-BrPA-induced cell death in T98G cells, used as a GBM model. Multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) mRNA levels significantly increased after valproate treatment. 3-BrPA-induced cell death, which was enhanced by valproate, was inhibited in the presence of MK571, a MRP inhibitor, or Ko143, a BCRP inhibitor. In addition, treatment with 3-BrPA and valproate for 48 h reduced cellular ATP levels compared to those in the 3-BrPA alone treatment group. However, cellular ATP levels were recovered in the presence of MK571 or Ko143, compared to those in the 3-BrPA and valproate treatment groups.
   In conclusion, we suggested that valproate enhanced 3-BrPA-induced cell death. This might be attributable to the increase in cellular ATP consumption owing to valproate-induced MRP2 or BCRP expression.

AB Formulating poorly water-soluble drug, itraconazole (ITZ), as dry powder inhaler (DPI) may be more effective for the treatment of invasive pulmonary Aspergillosis than intravenous injection and oral administration. It is necessary to improve the dissolution of ITZ because the alveolar lining fluid is limited and thus the dissolution of ITZ in the lung may be slow and incomplete. However, too fast dissolution may result in over-absorption into the circulation and thus insufficient distribution in the lung. The purpose of this study is to understand the relationship between in-vitro dissolution and in-vivo distribution of ITZ from DPI formulations. Two DPI formulations (F1 and F2) with identical compositions and similar aerodynamic behaviors were fabricated by hot melt extrusion and thus jet-milling. ITZ was formulated with mannitol as fine solid crystal suspension system to effectively improve its dissolution. In-vitro dissolution tests and in-vivo pharmacokinetic studies indicated that F1 released faster than F2 under both sink and non-sink conditions, but exhibited a lower lung retention and higher plasma absorption than F2. These results suggested that although dissolution enhancement of poorly water-soluble drugs in pulmonary delivery may be necessary to overcome problems such as local irritation and quick elimination by macrophages, it may have an impact on the distribution of the drug between the lung and the plasma. A balance between airway dissolution and systemic absorption should be taken into consideration when developing DPI formulations of poorly water-soluble ITZ.

AB This study evaluated the in vivo anticonvulsant effect of a spray-dried powder for reconstitution containing phenytoin-loaded lipid-core nanocapsules. The effect of chitosan coating on redispersibility, gastrointestinal stability, and drug release from nanoparticles was evaluated during the development of the powders. Maltodextrin was used as adjuvant in the spray-drying process. Chitosan coating played an important role in redispersibility, and large particles (> 100 mu m) were obtained using the highest concentration of solids in the feed. However, after aqueous redispersion, volume-based particle size was reduced to about 1 mu m. The release of nanoparticles from the surface of the spherical microagglomerates (roundness index = 0.75) was confirmed by SEM analysis. Powders reconstituted in water recovered partially the nanometric properties of the original suspensions and were stable for 24 h. Phenytoin-loaded chitosan-coated nanocapsules and their redispersed powders have good gastrointestinal stability, and are able to control drug release in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. Besides that, the reconstituted powder containing chitosan-coated nanocapsules exhibited improved anticonvulsant activity against seizures induced by pilocarpine in mice, compared to the non-encapsulated drug, representing an important approach in anticonvulsant treatments for children and adults.

AB Nebulization is currently used for delivery of antibiotics for respiratory infections. Bacteriophages (or phages) are effective predators of pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa commonly found in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). It is known that phages and antibiotics can potentially show synergistic antimicrobial effect on bacterial killing. In the present study, we investigated synergistic antimicrobial effect of phage PEV20 with five different antibiotics against three P. aeruginosa strains isolated from sputum of CF patients. The antibiotics included ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, colistin, aztreonam and amikacin, which are approved by U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for inhaled administration. Phage and antibiotic synergy was determined by assessing bacterial killing performing time-kill studies. Among the different phage-antibiotic combinations, PEV20 and ciprofloxacin exhibited the most synergistic effect. Two phage-ciprofloxacin combinations, containing 1/4 and 1/2 of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin against P. aeruginosa strains FADD1-PA001 (A) and JIP865, respectively were aerosolized using both air-jet and vibrating mesh nebulizers and the synergistic antibacterial activity was maintained after nebulization. Air-jet nebulizer generated droplets with smaller volume median diameters (3.6-3.7 mu m) and slightly larger span (2.3-2.4) than vibrating mesh nebulizers (5.1-5.3 mu m; 2.1-2.2), achieving a higher fine particle fraction (FPF) of 70%. In conclusion, nebulized phage PEV20 and ciprofloxacin combination shows promising antimicrobial and aerosol characteristics for potential treatment of respiratory tract infections caused by drug-resistant P. aeruginosa.

AB In the present study, the preparation of pharmaceutical mini-tablets was attempted in the framework of Quality by Design (QbD) context, by comparing traditionally used multi-linear regression (MLR), with artificially-intelligence based regression techniques (such as standard artificial neural networks (ANNs), particle swarm optimization (PSO) ANNs and genetic programming (GP)) during Design of Experiment (DoE) implementation. Specifically, the effect of diluent type and particle size fraction for three commonly used direct compression diluents (lactose, pregelatinized starch and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate, DCPD) blended with either hydrophilic or hydrophobic flowing aids was evaluated in terms of: a) powder blend properties (such as bulk (Y1) and tapped (Y-2) density, Carr's compressibility index (Y-3, CCI), Kawakita's compaction fitting parameters a (Y-4) and 1/b (Y-5)), and b) mini-tablet's properties (such as relative density (Y-6), average weight (Y-7) and weight variation (Y-8)). Results showed better flowing properties for pregelatinized starch and improved packing properties for lactose and DPCD. MLR analysis showed high goodness of fit for the Y-1, Y-2, Y-4, Y-6 and Y-8 with RMSE values of Y-1 = 0.028, Y-2 = 0.032, Y-4 = 0.019, Y-6 = 0.015 and Y-8 = 0.130; while for rest responses, high correlation was observed from both standard ANNs and GP. PSO-ANNs fitting was the only regression technique that was able to adequately fit all responses simultaneously (RMSE values of Y-1 = 0.026, Y-2 = 0.022, Y-3 = 0.025, Y-4 = 0.010, Y-5 = 0.063, Y-6 = 0.013, Y-7 = 0.064 and Y-8 = 0.104).

DT Article
DE Oral film; Orodispersible film; Wet film thickness; In-line thickness;

ID ORODISPERSIBLE FILMS; QUANTIFICATION
AB The key parameter of the oral film production process is the wet film thickness since it regulates the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) content of the finished product. There is no general recommendation on how to adjust the gap height of the coating knife during the film manufacturing process to obtain the target content. Therefore, trial and error approaches are common to determine the surplus of drug for every newly developed formulation. This wastes resources, money and time and calls for an adequate in-line tool for wet film thickness measurement during the film manufacturing process to ensure consistent quality. In this work, a chromatic confocal optical probe was implemented into a continuous oral film manufacturing process on a pilot-scale coating bench. The optical probe allows a non-destructive and contactless wet film thickness measurement. The validation of the method showed good results. Linearity was demonstrated over a wide range of film thicknesses (R-2 = 0.999). A good precision between different films was revealed by a coefficient of variation smaller than 2%. The robustness investigations showed that the method is applicable for transparent and non-transparent film forming masses. Furthermore, coloring agents, particles in the polymer mass and different viscosities do not influence the thickness measurement.

AB Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease with high mortality and poor prognosis. Curcumin shows anti-inflammatory effect by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting NF-kappa B mediated inflammation. Here, we developed inhalable curcumin-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) large porous microparticles (LPMPs) for the treatment of IPF. Curcumin LPMPs were rough and loose particles with many pores on the surfaces and channels in the inner spaces. The mean geometric diameter of them was larger than 10 mu m while the aerodynamic diameter was only 3.12 mu m due to their porous structures. They showed a fine particle fraction (FPF) < 4.46 mu m of 13.41%, 71% cumulative release after 9 h, and more importantly, they avoided uptake by alveolar macrophages. Therefore, most of released curcumin had opportunities to enter lung tissues. Rat pulmonary fibrosis models were established via once intratracheal administration of bleomycin. Curcumin powders and curcumin LPMPs were administered on Days 2, 7, 14, and 21. Curcumin LPMPs remarkably attenuated lung injuries, decreased hydroxyproline contents, reduced the synthesis of collagen I, and inhibited the expressions of TNF-alpha, TGF-beta 1, NF-kappa B p65 and MMP9. Moreover, curcumin LPMPs showed higher antifibrotic activity than curcumin powders. Curcumin LPMPs are a promising inhalable medication for the treatment of IPF.

   CORNEAL CRYSTALS; CLINICAL-TRIAL; COMPLICATIONS; THERAPY
AB Cystinosis is a genetic disease that leads to the accumulation of intracellular cystine crystals in all organs including cornea due to the loss of cystine efflux transporters in the lysosome of the cells. While the mechanism for formation of intracellular cystine is well understood for most organs, it does not explain many observations for crystal accumulation in the cornea of cystinosis patients. First, the crystals in cornea are extracellular and needle-like with several hundred microns length which is in sharp contrast with the rectangular or hexagonal crystals found throughout other organs. Second, these crystals are arranged parallel to the stromal collagen, which is a unique to the cornea. Third, crystal growth in the cornea reaches a saturation point after where no further crystallization occurs. We propose a hypothesis supported by in vitro and ex vivo data to explain these observations. We hypothesize that the stroma crystals form extracellularly due to the ionic interactions between the cystine diffusing into the eye and collagen fibrils present in the stroma. We examine cystine crystal growth both with in vitro polymer solutions and ex vivo in rabbit cadaver eyes to show that negatively charged polymers lead to the formation of more cystine precipitation in aqueous solution and that needle-like cystine crystal formation can be observed only in presence of certain polyelectrolytes including collagen. This proposed mechanism explains many of the yet unanswered questions but it needs further support from in vivo studies. The improved understanding could lead to improved treatment of corneal cystinosis.

AB The lipid membrane composition defines the physical and pharmacological characteristics of liposomal drugs, and it can be tailored to meet the desired drug delivery needs. The current study is aimed to provide a sharper understanding of the lipid composition effect on doxorubicin (DOX) delivery kinetics, using cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine lipids (PCs) with different acyl chains in liposomal DOX formulations. The PCs were distearoyl (DSPC), dipalmitoyl (DPPC), dimyristoyl (DMPC) and egg-derived PC (EPC), either alone or in combination with cholesterol. Several characteristics were monitored, including DOX loading capacity of liposomes, DOX release in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), PBS/human plasma including buffy coat and human blood, cell uptake, as well as in vivo distribution and therapeutic effects in BALB/c mice bearing C26 colon carcinoma. Addition of cholesterol to liposomal formulation enhanced the particle size stability of the liposomes and the DOX-to-lipid ratio. EPC-liposomes and EPC/Cholesterol-liposomes showed few distinctive features. Overall, cholesterol decreased DOX release from the liposomes, and longer saturated fatty acyl chains in PC decreased DOX release and side-effects and increased the anti-tumor effects of liposomal DOX.

AB 2 dimensional (2D) materials are budding new class of materials with exciting potential in optical, electrical, chemical and biomedical applications. Inspired by the attractive properties of graphene attributing to its 2D structure has stimulated researchers to hunt for new 2D materials. Unique characteristics like high surface-volume ratio, shape, surface charge, anisotropic nature and tunable functionalities of 2D structures opens up its application scope further. 2D materials have marked their impact on a wide range of area notably material science, optoelectronics, engineering and biomedical science. Currently, researchers are focusing on developing new 2D materials and functionalizing 2D materials to achieve desired properties. This review underlines the recent renovations done to 2D materials so as improve its functionality and biocompatibility. Growing trend towards exploring the potential of 2D materials for biomedical applications including targeted drug delivery, imaging, photothermal therapy, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine emphasize the need to consider its biosafety. Large surface area of 2D materials increases chances of exposure of these materials towards cells which in turn shoots up the possibility for cellular interactions augmenting chances of potential toxicity. The present review concludes that the 2D materials are promising choice for next generation biomedical device development.

AB Near-Infrared (NIR) dyes forming some of the photosensitizer agents show imaging and therapy features by themselves. NIR dyes show photodynamic therapy by formation of reactive oxygen species and imaging by NIR Fluorescence light. Photodynamic therapy occurs from irradiation of laser or light to photosensitizer matters and following by the formation of reactive oxygen species diseased tissues or cells can be killed effectively. NIR dyes have advantages such as stability, high specificity and sensitivity when compared with the other photosensitizer and imaging agents. Drug delivery systems are getting attention for either diagnosis or therapy of almost all of the diseases. Theranostic nanoparticles comprise the substances which shows the imaging and treatment features together. Besides, the combination of active substance and the imaging agent can also be encapsulated in theranostic nanoparticles. Many researchs are performed to evaluate the efficacy of theranostic drug delivery systems particularly polymeric nanoparticles in order to enhance targeting properties, specificity and bioavailability. Polymeric nanoparticles give advantages because of easier degradation properties when compared with the others. Theranostic polymeric nanoparticles can be used for NIR imaging and photodynamic therapy of several diseases especially cancers.

AB The study deals with collocated Godunov type finite volume schemes applied to the two-dimensional linear wave equation with Coriolis source term. The purpose is to explain the wrong behaviour of the classic scheme and to modify it in order to avoid accuracy issues around the geostrophic equilibrium and in geostrophic adjustment processes. To do so, a Hodge-like decomposition is introduced. Then three different well-balanced strategies are introduced. Some properties of the associated modified equations are proven and then extended to the semi-discrete case. Stability of fully discrete schemes under a suitable CFL condition is established thanks to a Von Neumann analysis. Some numerical results reinforce the purpose and exhibit the concrete improvements achieved by the application of these new techniques in both linear and nonlinear cases. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB In Engquist et al. (2016) [8], the Wasserstein metric was successfully introduced to the full waveform inversion. We apply this method to the earthquake location problem. For this problem, the seismic stations are far from each other. Thus, the trace by trace comparison (Yang et al. [47]) is a natural way to compare the earthquake signals.
   Under this framework, we have derived a concise analytic expression of the Frechet gradient of the Wasserstein metric, which leads to a simple and efficient implementation of the adjoint method. We square and normalize the earthquake signals for comparison so that the convexity of the misfit function with respect to earthquake hypocenter and origin time can be realized and observed numerically. To reduce the impact of noise, which does not offset each other after the signals are squared, a new control parameter is introduced. Finally, the LMF (Levenberg-Marquardt-Fletcher) method is applied to solve the resulted optimization problem. According to the numerical experiments, only a few iterations are required to converge to the real earthquake hypocenter and origin time. Even for data with noise, we can obtain reasonable and convergent numerical results. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we present and study a flexible and accurate numerical solver in the context of three-dimensional computational nanophotonics. More precisely, we focus on the propagation of electromagnetic waves through metallic media described by a non-local dispersive model. For this model, we propose a discretization based on a high-order Discontinuous Galerkin time-domain method, along with a low-storage Runge-Kutta time scheme of order four. The semi-discrete stability of the scheme is analyzed for classical numerical fluxes, i.e. centered and upwind. Furthermore, the numerical treatment is enriched with an enhanced approximation of the geometry based on isoparametric curvilinear meshes. We finally assess our approach on several test cases, from academic to more physical ones. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID PLASMA; SIMULATIONS; CODE; MESH
AB We investigate structured grids aligned to the contours of a two-dimensional flux-function with an X-point (saddle point). Our theoretical analysis finds that orthogonal grids exist if and only if the Laplacian of the flux-function vanishes at the X-point. In general, this condition is sufficient for the existence of a structured aligned grid with an X-point. With the help of streamline integration we then propose a numerical grid construction algorithm. In a suitably chosen monitor metric the Laplacian of the flux-function vanishes at the X-point such that a grid construction is possible.
   We study the convergence of the solution to elliptic equations on the proposed grid. The diverging volume element and cell sizes at the X-point reduce the convergence rate. As a consequence, the proposed grid should be used with grid refinement around the X-point in practical applications. We show that grid refinement in the cells neighbouring the X-point restores the expected convergence rate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A consistent and conservative immersed boundary method has been developed to accurately and efficiently solve two topics: magnetohydrodynamics flows with a complex boundary and moving boundary problems. Based on a least square interpolation reconstruction method, a unified form of boundary condition is described to handle a single domain situation while a mixed boundary condition is used for coupled conditions of multi-domain. In order to achieve the consistency with a desired wall boundary condition, a so-called approximation-correction procedure is done, and an imposing Neumann boundary condition is discussed with two kinds of different schemes. Besides, a consistent and conservative scheme is implemented to satisfy both the charge and mass conservation laws on cells around the immersed surface. Then, a conservative interpolation is reconstructed for velocity in moving boundary problems. At last, the applied numerical method is validated by stationary and moving boundary cases and an excellent agreement is obtained with good accuracy, efficiency and conservation. Especially, the consistent and conservative immersed boundary method can obtain almost the same accurate results as those from the cut cell technique (Seo and Mittal, 2011) [14] for a moving boundary problem by reducing the spurious pressure.

AB We present a new method for the solution of PDEs on manifolds M subset of R(d )of co-dimension one using stable scale-free radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Our method involves augmenting polyharmonic spline (PHS) RBFs with polynomials to generate RBF-finite difference (RBF-FD) formulas. These polynomial basis elements are obtained using the recently-developed least orthogonal interpolation technique (LOI) on each RBF-FD stencil to obtain local restrictions of polynomials in R-3 to stencils on M. The resulting RBF-LOI method uses Cartesian coordinates, does not require any intrinsic coordinate systems or projections of points onto tangent planes, and our tests illustrate robustness to stagnation errors. We show that our method produces high orders of convergence for PDEs on the sphere and torus, and present some applications to reaction-diffusion PDEs motivated by biology. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB We recently developed a treecode-accelerated boundary integral (TABI) solver for solving Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation H. The solver has combined advantages in accuracy, efficiency, memory, and parallelization as it applies a well-posed boundary integral formulation to circumvent many numerical difficulties associated with the PB equation and uses an 0 (N log N) treecode to accelerate the GMRES iterative solver. However, as observed in our previous work [2], occasionally when the mesh generator produces low quality triangles, the number of GMRES iterations required to solve the discretized boundary integral equations Ax = b could be large. To address this issue, we design a preconditioning scheme using preconditioner matrix M such that M-1 A has much improved condition while M-1 z can be rapidly computed for any vector z. In this scheme, the matrix M carries the interactions between boundary elements on the same leaf only in the tree structure thus is block diagonal with many computational advantages. The sizes of the blocks in M are conveniently controlled by the treecode parameter N-0, the maximum number of particles per leaf. The numerical results show that this new preconditioning scheme improves the TABI solver with significantly reduced iteration numbers and better accuracy, particularly for protein sets on which TABI solver previously converges slowly. In addition, this preconditioning scheme potentially can improve the condition number of various multipole method accelerated boundary elements solvers in scattering, fluids, elasticity, etc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Large eddy simulation (LES) has been increasingly used to tackle vortex-dominated turbulent flows. In LES, the quality of the simulation results hinges upon the quality of the numerical discretizations in both space and time. It is in this context we perform a Fourier analysis of several popular methods in LES including the discontinuous Galerkin (DG), finite difference (FD), and compact difference (CD) methods. We begin by reviewing the semi-discrete versions of all methods under consideration, followed by a fully-discrete analysis with explicit Runge-Kutta (RK) time integration schemes. In this regard, we are able to unravel the true dispersion/dissipation behavior of DG and Runge-Kutta DG (RKDG) schemes for the entire wavenumber range using a combined-mode analysis. In this approach, we take into account all eigenmodes in DG and RKDG schemes. The physical-mode is verified to be a good approximation for the asymptotic behavior of these DG schemes in the low wavenumber range. After that, we proceed to compare the DG, FD, and CD methods in dispersion and dissipation properties. Numerical tests are conducted using the linear advection equation to verify the analysis. In comparing different methods, it is found that the overall numerical dissipation strongly depends on the time step. Compact difference (CD) and central FD schemes, in some particular settings, can have more numerical dissipation than the DG scheme with an upwind flux. This claim is then verified through a numerical test using the Burgers' equation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, an advanced numerical technique is proposed for a low-frequency electromagnetic field simulation. The finite difference time domain (FDTD) method is one of the best methods for analyzing electromagnetic field problems, which require high levels of precision, such as a heterogeneous whole-body voxel human model. However, directly using the standard FDTD method in the quasi-static frequency band requires an extra-large number of iterations. We overcome this drawback using the hybrid of surface equivalence theorem and quasi-static FDTD (QS-FDTD) method. The surface equivalence theorem is used to consider arbitrary shape of source and the QS-FDTD is applied to obtain electromagnetic response quickly in the low-frequency region. The results of the proposed method are in good agreement with those from a commercial electromagnetic simulator. The proposed method is valid where the quasi-static approximation is satisfied.

AB Iterated pressure-correction projection schemes for the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are developed, analyzed and exemplified, in relation to preconditioned iterative methods and the pressure-Schur complement equation. Typical pressure-correction schemes perform only one iteration per stage or time step, and suffer from splitting errors that result in spurious numerical boundary layers and a limited order of convergence in time. We show that performing iterations not only reduces the effects of the splitting errors, but can also be more efficient computationally than merely reducing the time step. We devise stopping criteria to recover the desired order of temporal convergence, and to drive the splitting error below the time-integration error. We also develop and implement the iterated pressure corrections with both multi-step and multi-stage time integration schemes. Finally, to reduce further the computational cost of the iterated approach, we combine it with an Aitken acceleration scheme. Our theoretical results are validated and illustrated by numerical test cases for the Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations, using implicit-explicit (IMEX) backwards differences and Runge-Kutta time-integration solvers. The test cases comprise a now classical manufactured solution in the projection method community and a modified version of a more recently proposed manufactured solution. The different error types, stopping criterion, recovered orders of convergence, and acceleration rates are illustrated, as well as the effects of the rotational corrections and time-integration schemes. It is found that iterated pressure-correction schemes can retrieve the accuracy and temporal convergence order of fully-coupled schemes and are computationally more efficient than classic pressure-correction schemes.

AB Fluid flows confined in nano-pore structures exhibit physical behaviors that are not observed in large-scale structures. Molecular dynamics simulation has been used for modeling nano-scale fluid flows at nanoscale, but is deemed to be computationally very expensive and is often limited to problems with simple geometry.
   We develop an integrated fractional partial differential equation and molecular dynamics upscaling modeling of anomalously diffusive transport in heterogeneous nano-pore structures, which has a significantly improved computational efficiency and memory requirement over the molecular dynamics simulation. Representative applications demonstrate the usage of the new model, which takes the model a few hours on a laptop that would otherwise require a molecular dynamics simulation in the matter of at least 100 years of CPU time on a parallel computer.

AB The role of porous structure and glass density in the response behavior to compressive deformation of amorphous materials is investigated via molecular dynamics simulations. The disordered, porous structures were prepared by quenching a high-temperature binary mixture below the glass transition point into the phase coexistence region. With decreasing average glass density, the pore morphology in quiescent samples varies from a random distribution of compact voids to complex pore networks embedded in a continuous glass phase. We find that during compressive loading at constant volume, the porous structure is linearly transformed in the elastic regime and the elastic modulus follows a power-law increase as a function of the average glass density. Upon further compression, pores deform significantly and coalesce into large voids leading to formation of domains with nearly homogeneous glass phase, which provides an enhanced resistance to deformation at high strain.

AB The glass to crystal transformation was studied for two glasses with composition 25Na(2)center dot O.50MoO(3)center dot 25P(2)O(6) and 25Na(2)O center dot 50WO(3)center dot 25P(2)O(5). During the heat treatment process, two crystalline compounds were formed, NaMoO2PO4 and NaWO2PO4, respectively. Physico-chemical properties of the corresponding glasses and crystals were compared, as well as their Raman and P-31 MAS NMR spectra. Differential thermal analysis revealed crystallization peaks at 483 degrees C for the Mo-containing glass and at 624 degrees C for the W-containing glass; melting points of crystalline compounds were determined as 695 +/- 2 degrees C for NaMoO2PO4 and 858 +/- 2 degrees C for NaMoO2PO4. Sodium tungstate-phosphate glass has lower solubility in comparison with the sodium molybdatephosphate glass. The study of the crystallization mechanism showed a prevailing surface nucleation. P-31 MAS NMR spectra of the two glasses revealed the same shape and almost the same width, which reflects a similar local environment for P in these glasses. The position of the resonance for W-containing glass at a more negative chemical shift than the Mo-containing one is attributed to the different electrical field strength of W atoms than Mo atoms. P-31 MAS NMR spectra of crystals revealed two resonances at + 17 and -0.5 ppm for the Mo glass and at -0.1 and -1.9 ppm for the W glass, reflecting the presence of two different phosphorus short range environments, in agreement with their crystal structure. Raman spectra showed similarity in structural features for Mo and W glasses and their isomorphic compounds. Splitting of the dominant Raman bands in the crystal spectra reflects a distortion of MoO6 and WO6 octahedra. Raman spectra also suggested the breaking of Mo-O-Mo and WOW linkages during crystallization.

AB Biomaterials are attracting an ever-increasing research interest. As part of this overall effort, we report herein the fabrication and characteristics of Zr-based ribbon samples with three different compositions: Zr56CO28Ga16, Zr56Co28Ga14Si2, and Zr56Co28Ga14Sn2. The supercooled-liquid region Delta T = T-x - T-g of these materials is 16, 18, and 29 K, respectively, where T-x is the temperature of the onset of crystallization and T-g is the glass-transition temperature. The samples are thermally characterized by using differential scanning calorimetry and by determining the activation energy. The corrosion resistance is determined by immersing the materials for up to 20 days in a simulated body fluid, and the cytotoxicity is measured from the proliferation of osteoblast-like cells on the samples. Finally, the mechanical properties are investigated by nanoindentation. The Young's modulus is 112 GPa. These results all highlight the suitability of this metallic glass for biomedical applications.

AB Two series of Lead Borate glass with compositions 25B(2)O(3)-(73.8-x)PbO-xM(2)O-0.6Cr(2)O(3)-0.6SeO(2) (M = Ag and Li) with x = 3, 4.5 and 6 mol% in case Ag2O and 3, 6 and 9 mol% for Li2O are prepared using conventional melt quenching technique. The anomalous behavior observed in the measured hydrostatic density and the calculated molar volume at x = 3.0 mol% are explained on the base of the bridging and non-bridging Oxygen bonds formed as a result of introduction of Ag2O as well as Li2O modifiers in the PbO-B2O3 host network. The irregular trend distinguished in the calculated values of the activation energy of ionic conduction are argued to the work done by modifier ions during its motion through the pathways between two non-bridging Oxygen defects.
   The relaxation frequency peaks observed in the temperature dependent capacitance-frequency measurements indicated that the incorporation of Ag2O and Li2O in lead-borate network produces a non-bridging Oxygen hole centers (NBOHC) trap defect. This relaxation takes place due to an emission from shallow acceptor NBOHC like defect level with an activation energy <= 52 meV for the investigated compositions.

AB Properties and structural features of xNd(2)O(3)-(100-x)(20Fe(2)O(3)-60P(2)O(5)-20Na(2)O) (x = 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 mol%) glasses have been investigated in detail by Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), Raman and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) respectively. The results show that the samples with x < 8 mol % are completely amorphous. Incorporation of Nd2O3 increases the T-g value and thermal stability of the iron sodium phosphate glasses containing less 8 mol% Nd2O3. The predominant network structural of the Nd2O3-doped iron sodium phosphate glasses is Q(1) units. The content of Q(1) and Q(0) units increases and that of Q(2) decreases with increasing neodymium content. The normalized leaching rates of Nd in Nd2O3-doped iron sodium phosphate glasses in 90 degrees C deionized water for 7 days are below 10(-6) g m(-2) d(-1). The conclusions show that iron sodium phosphate glass is a potential host for the disposal of high-level nuclear wastes which are rich in trivalent radioactive oxide.

AB In this study, the structural, thermal and magnetic characteristics of Fe75-xTa5Si10C10+x (x = 0, 5, 10) powders processed by mechanical alloying (MA) were investigated. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicated that by increasing the level of carbon, the structural refinement and lattice strain of the nanocrystalline Fe-based solid solution formed in the early stages of milling are enhanced. Furthermore, quantitative XRD analyses demonstrated that the glass forming ability (GFA) is remarkably improved by increasing the amount of carbon, where the percentage of amorphous phase increases from 56% for x = 0 to 98% for x = 10 after 120 h of milling. In addition, thermodynamic calculations, based on the extended Miedema's model, showed that the driving force for the glass formation increases with the concentration of carbon. Also, thermal analyses demonstrated that both the glass transition (T-g) and the onset of the crystallization (T-x) temperatures increase with the content of carbon, suggesting an enhanced thermal stability of the glassy phase. Additionally, the extension of the supercooled liquid region for the alloys with x = 5 and 10 reached a large value of 75 and 78 K, respectively, manifesting a high thermal stability of their supercooled liquid. Magnetic measurements showed that the soft magnetic behavior of the powders milled for 120 h is improved by increasing the level of carbon in terms of a decrease in coercivity (H-c) from 3.7 kA/m for x = 0 to 2.1 kA/m for x = 10. The evolution of the magnetic properties with annealing temperature reflected that the alloy with x = 10 displays a minimum H-c of 1.2 kA/m after annealing at 673 K.

AB This work presents the production and characterization of a new prolific binary glass system based on SbPO4-GeO2. The dependence of GeO2 content on thermal, structural and optical properties were investigated by means of thermal analysis, Raman, UV Vis-NIR, infrared, M-lines and EPR spectroscopy. Glass transition temperatures remain constant around 410 degrees C when GeO2 content is increased, indicating that GeO4 units are not responsible for increasing the connectivity of PO4 units. Thermal stability linearly increases as a function of GeO2 content, reaching a value around 400 degrees C for glass containing 90 mol% of GeO2. Raman spectroscopy was used to evaluate the glass structural changes when GeO2 is incorporated from 30 to 90 mol% indicating a gradual change from a phosphate to a germanate glass skeleton. The optical window extends from 350 nm at UV region, up to 2.7 mu m in the middle-infrared region limited by the multiphonon cut-off due to the strong OH absorption. M-lines technique shows that increasing GeO2 content decreases the refractive index, mainly because the lower concentration of higher polarizable antimony atoms. EPR spectra of heat treated V2O5 doped glasses, at different temperatures above the glass transition temperature, shows the characteristic eight-line hyperfine splitting spectrum. The spin Hamiltonian parameters obtained from the simulated spectra indicates that the paramagnetic tetravalent vanadium ions in the glasses exist as vanadyl form VO2+, located in axially distorted octahedral sites. For glasses treated at higher temperatures a second VO2+ component appears in the EPR spectra and the analysis of the spin-Hamiltonian parameters suggests that these vanadyl ions are in more tetragonal distorted octahedral sites than those in the glass.

AB Electron beam (EB)-induced deformations of the surface of thin Cr films on soda-lime glass and Si substrates were studied using atomic force microscopy. The thickness of the Cr films was within the range 20 to 500 nm. The thin films were irradiated with a 30 keV EB in the vacuum chamber of a scanning electron microscope. The EB current was within the range 10 pA to 15 nA, and the irradiation time was within the range 30 s to 10 min. The lateral size of the deformations was typically at the micrometre scale, while their vertical size was at the sub micron and nanometre scales. Depressions of up to 80 nm deep and bulges of up to 700 nm high were observed. Irradiated areas were wet etched using K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] in an alkaline solution. It was observed that EB irradiation can significantly decrease the etching rate and that wet etching can increase the height to width ratio of EB-induced deformations on Cr thin films. Possible physical mechanisms for formation of these deformations are discussed.

AB With the aim of developing a new inexpensive soft magnetic amorphous alloy exhibiting high saturation magnetic flux density (B-s) above 1.7 T, we examined the formation, thermal stability and magnetic properties for melt-spun Fe-B-Si-C amorphous alloys with high (B + C)/Si content ratios. The high B-s of 1.71-1.73 T exceeding the previously reported B, was obtained for annealed Fe82-82.5B15Si2Ca0.5-1 alloys. These high B, alloys exhibit low coercivity below 8 A/m and good bending ductility. The 82.5Fe alloy with the highest B-s of 1.73 T also has the highest hardness. Besides, the 82.5Fe alloy has the largest nearest neighbor atomic distance among the present alloys. The correlation between the highest B, and the largest atomic distance is similar for (Fe,CO)(83-86)B15-16Si1 amorphous alloys. The 82.5Fe and 82Fe alloys are located near the critical composition where the crystallization changes from two stages of alpha-Fe(Si) + amorphous -> alpha-Fe(Si) + Fe-3(B,C) to a single stage of alpha-Fe (Si) + Fe-3(B,C). These results indicate the importance of the special alloy composition with the largest atomic distance and high stability to primary alpha-Fe precipitation, in addition to high (B + C)/Si content ratios, for the synthesis of a new ductile amorphous alloy with high B-s and good magnetic softness.

AB The aim of this work is the development of a porous geopolymeric foam with sound absorbing properties using silica fume as the pore generation agent. The samples were manufactured using a coal combustion fly ash as source material for the geopolymerization reaction, an alkaline solution as activating solution and silica fume as pore forming agent. Three parameters were studied: silica fume proportion (0, 20 and 40 wt%), activating solution (potassium silicate and potassium hydroxide) and setting temperature (40 and 70 degrees C). Once the samples were prepared, the experimental study of the most important physical, mechanical and acoustic features were carried out. The increase in the proportion of silica fume in the mixture and setting temperature produced a reduction in setting time and a raise of open void porosity, reducing the compressive strength at 28 days up to a half but increasing the sound absorption. The influence of activating solution in open porosity and sound absorbing properties was not very important.

AB Size constrains of traditional rapid solidification processes for fabrication of Mg-Zn-Ca bulk metallic glasses have limited their biomedical applications as implants. In this work, large-sized Mg65Zn30Ca5 amorphous coating was fabricated by laser remelting. The microstructure characterization and phase analysis indicated that the laser remelted coating was mainly composed of amorphous with a small amount of metastable crystalline Mg51Zn20. The thermal stability and crystallization behavior of the produced Mg65Zn30Ca5 coating were invested by differential scanning calorimetry. Results of potentiodynamic polarization test showed that the amorphous coating exhibited excellent corrosion resistance properties, which in close proximity to the Mg65Zn30Ca5 glassy ribbon. All these results suggested that the Mg65Zn30Ca5 amorphous coating could expand the potential application of Mg-Zn-Ca metallic glasses in the field of biomedicine.

AB Study of 20MgO-20Al(2)O(3)-57SiO(2) (MAS) glasses occupies a crucial position for optimizing glass performances for industrial applications. Here, we employed Cr2O3 dopant, and successfully prepared series of 20MgO-(20-x)Al2O3-57SiO(2)-3B(2)O(3)-xCr(2)O(3) (MASBC) glasses with a doping level, denoted by x, ranging from 0 to 1 mol%, by conventional melt -quenching method. The investigation was systematically conducted using DSC, XRD, IR, optical absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and luminescence techniques. Structural analysis shows that all glass samples are amorphous in nature, and the glass network was mainly identified as the functional groups of [SiO4] and [AlO4]. From the optical absorption data, various optical parameters such as optical band gap, Urbach energy, crystal field and Racah parameters can be obtained. Besides, the luminescence and excitated spectra were recorded to confirm the presence of Cr3+ in a weak crystal field, and the luminescence lifetime was found to decrease with increased Cr2O3 due to the dipole interaction between the Cr3+ pairs (Cr3+-Cr3+). The EPR spectra of Cr2O3-doped MASBC glass exhibit two resonance signals at g = 5.33 and 1.96, indicating the characteristic of Cr3+ ions. Subsequently, according to the calculated bonding parameters, we confirm a strong ionic character of glass samples.

AB Eu3+ doped transparent glass ceramics (GCs) are obtained via melt-quenching technique and subsequent heating. The structure and morphology of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). XRD and SEM results showed that tetragonal barium molybdate (BaMoO4) crystals are precipitated in the glass matrix. The excitation spectrum of BaMoO4:Eu3+ GCs are composed of Eu3+ ions characteristic excitation peaks. The emission spectra of BaMoO4:Eu3+ GCs consists of several sharp emission bands center at 592 nm, 615 nm, 653 nm and 702 nm, respectively. Among them, the strongest one was located at 615 nm due to D-5(0) -> F-7(2) transition of Eu3+ generating bright red light. The quantum efficiency of BaMoO4:Eu3+ GC is 46.3%, and the fluorescence lifetime is 2.0716 ms, when the Eu3+ ions doping concentration is 0.7 mol%.The results show that Eu3+ doped BaMoO4 glass ceramics exhibit a potential to act as a kind of red phosphor for white light-emitting diodes (W-LEDs).

AB The Tb3+ and Dy3+ doped phosphosilicate glasses prepared by melt quenching method are studied for light emitting diode applications. For certain base glass compositions, the crystals Ca-3(PO4)(2) and CaZn2(PO4)(2) are precipitated during the melt quenching process, which induce the narrowness of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the emission bands peaked at 574 nm of Dy3+ ions. The intensity of emission bands of Tb3+ ions at 489 and 544 nm is significantly enhanced with the increase of P2O5 content. The ratio of the emission located at the yellow wavelength portion to that located at the blue wavelength region of the Dy3+ ions can be apparently tuned by changing the P2O5 content as well. In addition, the energy transfer between Tb3+ and Dy3+ in the as prepared glasses is also discussed. The Commission International de I'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity diagram shows that the emission hue is dependent on the glass composition. The Tb3+ and Dy3+ doped phosphosilicate glasses have promising prospects in light emitting diode applications.

ID CRYSTALLIZATION; BEHAVIOR
AB Bayan Obo tailings (BOTs), fly ash (FAS), and stainless-steel slag (SSS) are industrial wastes that require reasonable, clean, and effective utilization for environment protection. The paper focuses on the structure and properties of glass-ceramics that were prepared by melting BOT, FAS, and SSS raw materials. The effect of CaF2 on the viscosity, structure, and performance of CaO-Al2O3-MgO-SiO2 (CAMS) slag glass-ceramics is determined by viscometer, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and physicochemical properties measurements. The results show that moderate amounts of CaF2 facilitates depolymerization of the silicate networks, which leads to a decrease in the melting temperature, viscosity and viscous activation energy of glass. However, the content of more than 3% CaF2 results in a dramatic decreases in the chemical stability of the glass-ceramics because of the transformations of the main crystalline phase from diopside to anorthite, which is accompanied by fluorite precipitation.

AB In the study, amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) nanoparticles were prepared by the coprecipitation method to optimize release profile of curcumin (Cur) and avoid burst releases, which were used to overcome the weakness of Cur, such as poor chemical stability and bioavailability. To find the best preparation condition, the influence of reaction concentration, temperature, time and pH on crystal phase of the samples was investigated by XRD and FTIR. The results showed that amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) was obtained, when pH value and the concentration of PO43- were 8 and 0.024 mM, prepared at 30 degrees C for 10 min. In vitro drug release assay, ACP nanoparticles showed high loading capacity of Cur and favorable pH-responsive drug release properties. Furthermore, the Cur-load ACP nanoparticles showed an excellent ability to scavenge free radical and damage A549 cells, resulting in a high antioxidant properties and low cell viability. Therefore, the as-prepared nanoparticles have promising applications in the food and biomedical fields.

The crystalline structure of the Nb2O5 ultrafine nanoparticles is characterized by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The Nb2O5 nanoparticles have large surface area and very fine particle size, which are favorable for increasing the active sites to take part in the catalytic reaction. The Nb2O5 nanoparticles exhibited high degradation rates for organic dye degradation under visible light irradiation and exhibited stable photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity under simulated sunlight irradiation. The nanocrystals highly dispersed in the amorphous matrix are found to be responsible for the photocatalytic ability of the material.

The minimum transmission loss of this fiber is approximately 3.4 dB/m at 5.9 mu m. Then, the fibers were tapered into different waist diameters of 30, 50, 70, and 90 pm. Those tapered fibers were used as sensor for detection of mixed liquid containing different ratios of methanol (CH3OH) and dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) by fiber evanescent wave spectroscopy in situ. Finally, the sensing characteristics of the tapered fibers to the mixed liquid were simulated based on finite-element method. The simulation results were in good agreement with the experimental results.

AB Lithium-ion conducting 46Li(2)O-4Al(2)O(3)-50P(2)O(5) (mol.%) glass was prepared using melt-quenching method. Doping of Fe2O3 is aimed to improve the electrochemical properties of the glass-ceramics. Raman spectroscopy shows that partially replacing Li2O by Fe2O3 has a minor effect on the glass network structure. Thermal behaviors of the Fe2O3-doped Li2O-Al2O3-P2O5 glasses were studied by DSC. The effects of partial substitution of Fe2O3 on the thermal, chemical and electrical properties of the Li2O-Al2O3-P2O5 glass-ceramics were investigated. The results of XRD suggest that with increase of Fe2O3 content, the diffraction peaks of LiPO3 and AlPO4 gradually decrease, and the diffraction peak of high-conductive phase LiFePO4 increases gradually. The electrical conductivity lies in the range of 5.28-359 x 10(-6) S/cm at room temperature. Moreover, the glass ceramics had a high chemical stability to water. The addition of Fe2O3 to 46Li(2)O-4Al(2)O(3)-50P(2)O(5) glass-ceramics improved the ionic conductivity, and the ionic conductivity of Fe2O3-doped glass-ceramics is nearly 70 times higher than Fe2O3-free one, which has a potential application as Li+ glassy solid electrolyte materials.

AB Barium tellurite, lead tellurite, molybdenum tellurite, lead silicate and bismuth borate glasses of the compositions: xBaO-(100-x)TeO2 (x = 10, 15 and 20 mol%), xPbO-(100-x)TeO2 (x = 15 and 20 mol%), 25MoO(3)-75TeO(2), xPbO-(100-x)SiO2 (x = 50, 60 and 65 mol%) and 40Bi(2)O(3)-60B(2)O(3) were prepared by melt-quenching. The effects of long duration thermal annealing (below the respective glass transition temperature (T-g) values) on the density, thermal properties and the short-range structure of glasses were studied. Density increases on average by about 0.5% to 1% and T-g values show drastic increase in the range of 8 degrees C-64 degrees C after annealing. Raman and FTIR studies were performed on glasses before and after annealing, FTIR studies found that bismuth borate glasses show a small but significant increase in the fraction of tetrahedral borons in the borate network with annealing. Raman studies on lead metasilicate glass showed an increase in the concentration of SiO4 units that contain three bridging oxygens. Raman and FTIR spectra of all annealed barium and lead tellurite glasses were indistinguishable from those of the initial samples, however the FTIR spectra of annealed 25MoO(3)-75TeO(2) glass show changes in the relative intensities of the peaks due to Mo-O vibrations along with the growth and sharpening of low frequency Raman bands, furthermore this glass also showed large differences in its crystallization and melting properties during thermal analysis.

AB Dynamic mechanical behaviors of the calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) under shock compression loading in layered direction have been investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The various piston velocities ranging from 0.2 to 3.0 km/s used to describe the propagation of stress waves have been employed in our MD simulations. The shock Hugoniot curve and the distribution of particle velocity are obtained. It is found that the Hugoniot elastic limit is 7.5 GPa, and the impact may induce elastic response, elastic-plastic response and shock regime. Our results reveal that only a continuous elastic wave exists when the particle velocity is below 0.5 km/s, while a new wave is generated when the particle velocity is at 0.5 km/s. With further increasing the particle velocity, a two-wave structure is generated. After the particle velocity is larger than 2.0 km/s, the shock wave is dominant. These findings provide important atomic insights for understanding the dynamic mechanical behaviors of C-S-H.

AB The influence of Zn/Zr ratio on the crystallization, microstructure, and properties of MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 (MAS) glass-ceramics was investigated. The sintering and crystallizing kinetics suggested that Zn/Zr ratio of 5/3 was beneficial to the sintering process and the crystallization. XRD indicated that the increase of Zn/Zr ratio changed the crystal phases and promoted the crystallinity. It was found that the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) was strongly dependent on the crystal phases. The mechanical properties were markedly improved by the increase of bulk density, crystallinity, and microstress. MAS glass-ceramics with Zn/Zr ratio of 5/3 sintered at low temperature of 900 degrees C shows good properties: epsilon(r) = 5.7, tan delta = 0.32 x 10(-3), sigma = 279 MPa, phi = 96 GPa, alpha = 3.46 x 10(-6)/degrees C, which is compatible with silicon chips.

AB Different formulations of geopolymers were synthesized in acidic media (phosphoric acid) starting from three different raw metakaolin materials to identify compositions of interest. Four different property groups were highlighted based on the most favorable thermal and water resistance properties (while maintaining acceptable mechanical properties). The groups were related to the chemical composition, setting time and setting temperature of the synthesized geopolymers. Indeed, mechanical strength was determined by chemical composition, such as the aluminum content and the amount of water in each sample. The results showed that the sample with Si/Al >= 1 and Al/P = 1 exhibited compressive stress to rupture values ranging between 66 and 120 MPa and was thermal resistant. Water resistance with a mechanical strength of 50 MPa was obtained for the samples with Al/P = 1 or 4 and Si/Al <= 1. This work highlights the possibility of selecting a specific property associated with the mechanical performance for an acidic geopolymer.

It was a surprise to find that such nanostructure consisting of diminutive SnO2 nanospheres decorated bulky WO3 nanosphere exhibited a high gas response and fast response-recovery speed towards acetone, mainly attributed to their synergetic effect as well as the heterojunction at the interface between the bulky WO3 nanosphere and diminutive SnO2 nanosphere, resulting in adequate surface adsorption and efficient electron transport.

AB In this letter, we introduced a novel method for the preparation of room temperature stable alpha-FAPbI(3) perovskite without using organic ligands and mixed cations by hydrothermal method. Structural, optical and morphology of the product were changed with respect to the temperature. Equal volume of the chlorobenzene anti-solvent was used together with perovskite solution to saturate and simply growing the perovskite crystals under hydrothermal method. Optimum temperature (140 degrees C) was determined from XRD and UV-vis absorption result achieving stable alpha-FAPbI(3) perovskite. This work favours the understanding of the large scale with stable alpha-FAPbI(3) perovskite with interesting morphology, and paves the way for potential applications in diverse field.

AB BCZT-CuY/rGO/PDMS composites with excellent elasticity and flexibility, and their nanogenerators (NGs) with favorable electrical properties, were fabricated. The impact of rGO on the dispersion of BCZT-CuY, the mechanical properties of BCZT-CuY/rGO/PDMS, and electrical performance of BCZT-CuY/rGO-based NGs were systematically investigated. The results indicated that the distribution of BCZT-CuY in PDMS with added rGO was much more uniform than that without rGO. Moreover, its elastic modulus and elongation at the break increased to 4.6 MPa and 250%, respectively, with the introduction of rGO. Apart from a high d(33) at the percolation threshold, the average V-OC (1.36 V) and I-SC (35nA) achieved by finger tapping BCZT-CuY/rGO-based NGs suggested their considerable potential in harvesting tiny energy.

Structural characterizations of these samples were investigated by XRD, Raman, SEM, TEM and HRTEM, and it shows that NiFe-LDH quantum dots with the average size of 5 nm dotted on the RGO sheets uniformly without any agglomeration. The OER tests show that, the NiFe-LDH@RGO = 1/1 sample can be used as a good OER catalyst with the overpotential of 313 mV (vs. RHE) at the current density of 10 mA cm (2) and Tafel slope of 35.1 mV dec (1).

AB We performed the finite element modeling for the first time to analyze the effect of gradient structures (GS) on the wear fatigue-resistant of rails in the rolling-sliding contacts. We found that GS can enhance the wear fatigue-resistant of rails by reducing the maximum horizontal and vertical displacements on the surface of rails. The thicker GS layers, the better the performance is. For a fixed GS layer thickness, increasing the surface yield strength can effectively reduce surface displacements. The outcome from this study can provide the design guideline for processing the gradient structures in the rail steels to obtain superior mechanical properties. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Hybrid supercapacitors that combine the advantages of supercapacitors (high power density and long cycle life) and batteries (high energy density) have been studied. In this paper, we fabricate the hybrid supercapacitors using LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 (NMC) cathode and activated carbon (AC) anode and investigate the electrochemical performances. The NMC/AC hybrid supercapacitors delivers a discharge capacitance of 66.2 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1) with satisfactory cycling stability (97.7% capacity retention after 14,000 cycles) and rate capability (89.9% retention at 5 A g(-1)). The combination of a NMC cathode and AC anode is proved to be applicable for high performance hybrid supercapacitors, benefiting from synergy effects from both NMC and AC. These results indicate that NMC/AC electrodes can be considered as an approach for future hybrid supercapacitors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ELECTROLYTE
AB Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) garnet is one of the most promising Lithium-ion solid electrolytes in all-solid-state Lithium-ion batteries, due to its higher chemical stability to Li metal and relatively higher lithium-ion conductivity. To further increase the electrical conductivity of LLZO, Sm3+ is doped into the Zr4+ site of LLZO so that excess Li occupies the position of the octahedral. Thereby lithium ion transport and increasing ionic conductivity are promoted. The optimal addition of Sm3+ is 0.06. Li(7+x)La(3)Zr(2-x)SmxO(12) (LLZSO, x = 0.06) electrolyte with cubic phase is obtained with sintering at 1200 degrees C for only 3 h. It has higher relative density and better ionic conductivity than the pristine LLZO. Its bulk and total ionic conductivity are similar to 6.4 x 10(-4) S.cm(-1) and 2.46 x 10(-4) S.cm(-1) at 20 degrees C, respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A carbazole based new n-type conjugated polymer (CP) has been synthesized and employed as a photosensitizer in polymer-sensitized solar cells (PSSCs). The synthesis of CP was accomplished by the reaction of appropriate monomer dialdehyde with aromatic dinitriles, under Knoevenagel condensation conditions followed by its characterization by H-1 NMR and FT-IR. The band gap of CP measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV), density functional theory (DFT) and diffuse reflectance (DR) UV-vis spectroscopy revealed closely matched values of 2.57, 2.47, and 2.64 eV respectively. Under the illumination of AM1.5G (100 mW cm(2)), CP based PSSCs exhibited power conversion efficiency of 2.08% with a short-circuit current density (J(SC)) of 7.0 mA/cm(2), an open-circuit voltage (V-OC) of 534 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 55.85%.

As-prepared composite material has anisotropic thermal properties with ultrahigh in-plane thermal conductivity and low in-plane coefficient of thermal expansion because of its extraordinary packed laminate structure. Thermal properties of Cu/graphite membrane composite can be designed according to requirements by adjusting volume fraction of graphite membrane in the composite. The maximum value of Cu/graphite membrane composite (50 vol% graphite membrane) in-plane thermal conductivity is 1005 W . m(-1) K-1, while the minimum value of the in-plane coefficient of thermal expansion is 7 x 10(-6) K-1.

AB Bio-nanosilica was obtained from rice husk thought an alternative ultrasound process and, the material was used to adsorb Crystal Violet (CV) dye from aqueous effluents. Ultrasound modified bio-nanosilica (UM-nSiO(2)) presented better characteristics than standard nano-silica (nSiO(2)), demonstrating that ultrasound technique has great potential to generate a promising material for adsorption purposes. The adsorption study was carried out by the kinetic curves, equilibrium isotherms and thermodynamics. Pseudo-second order model was the best to represent the kinetic curves. To represent the equilibrium curves, BET and Freundlich were suitable. Bio-nanosilica attained adsorption capacity of 495 mg g(-1 )and removal percentage of 98%, being an efficient adsorbent for CV dye. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Twinning process involving reversible motion of twin boundaries was examined and quantified in a rolled Mg-3Al-1Zn magnesium alloy compressed along two perpendicular directions. The evolution of twinning is analyzed by quasi in situ electron backscatter diffraction technique, and the detailed structure of the twin boundary is analyzed using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy technique. The results suggest that both twinning and detwinning are attributed to the mobility of twin boundaries. Low-angle boundaries were identified at the prior twin boundaries after detwinning due to the effect of alloying elements, and these low-angle boundaries will affect subsequent deformation. Twin boundary is serrated and consists of {10 (1) over bar 2} coherent twin boundaries and prism-basal boundaries that control twin boundary migration. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The thickness of compound layer and effective hardening layer could be effectively improved under the same plasma nitriding condition, which was about twice thicker as that of conventional plasma nitriding. Meanwhile, laser shock peening could significantly increase the surface hardness and slow down the decreasing trend of cross-sectional hardness. The significant enhancement effect of laser shock peening on plasma nitriding was mainly attributed to the increase of surface roughness from 0.015 mu m to 0.454 mu m and the pronounced defects in the deformation layer with a thickness of about 200 mu m, the former was beneficial to the adsorption of nitrogen atoms, and the latter could promote nitrogen atoms diffusing inwards, thus increasing the microhardness in the nitriding layer due to higher nitrogen concentration.

AB Hexagonal micro-rods of MOF-74-Ni have been synthesized through a facile and ultrafast (2 min) microwave-assisted approach, which was then utilized as a precursor for preparation of porous Ni2P/C composite. The as-prepared Ni2P/C exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a low onset potential of -94 mV, long-term stability (>24 h), and a Tafel slope of 113.2 mV dec(-1). The high performance was ascribed to large surface area owing to the porous structure, intrinsically high electrocatalytic activity of Ni2P, as well as high electrical conductivity from the carbon component.

AB A novel and facile approach for preparing a new type of nanohybrid (TNTs-Cr3+-DPyE) was explored by anchoring 1,2-di(pyridine-4-ly)ethyne (DPyE) in the chromium ions implanted TiO2 nanotube (TNTs) by coordination interaction. Subsequently, a wider optical absorption range and an improved electron transfer were achieved in the nanohybrid, which were profitable for improving the photoelectronic performance of the TNTs. The results showed the important role of Cr3+ in improving the light absorption and the electron transfer between TNTs and DPyE. This work developed a simple way to design and prepare highly active TNTs-based photoelectronic materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hole transporting layer (HTL) plays an important role in device stability and charge transport for inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a novel HTL consisted of mesoporous NiO nanosheet (NS) was fabricated via simple hydrothermal method. The contract region of HTL/perovskite was increased by using the mesoporous NiO NS network structure, resulting in the good interface contract and rapid charge transfer. Therefore, the corresponding devices exhibit an optimal power conversion efficiency of >12%, with hysteresis-less. Besides, the developed PSCs still maintain 75% efficiency after 500 h, implying its good stability. In a word, this mesoporous NiO NS structure can be a promising candidate for HTL of inverted PSCs.

AB Silicon is considered as a promising candidate for next-generation lithium-ion battery anodes due to its high theoretical capacity and low charge potential. However, large volume change during Li-ion insertion and extraction hinders its practical application. In this work, we develop a facile approach to fabricate pomegranate Si/Ni composite to solve the aforementioned problem. The pomegranate composites are linked together by Ni nanofoams, which can be directly converted into electrode by simple mechanical compression without the use of current collector, conductive agent, and binder. The pomegranate Si/Ni composite exhibits good cycling stability after 1000 cycles and a high reversible capacity of 0.84 mAh. This combustion method is a facile and economical approach, which provides a new idea for the commercial application of Si anode materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To solve the challenge of preparing magnetic mesoporous carbon nanospheres (MMCNs) with uniform and disperse particles, a series of MMCNs are achieved by a self-assembly procedure in one-pot aqueous solution. Impacts of magnetic source on the morphology and textural property of the as-synthesized MMCNs are systematically investigated by altering their adding time. An extended "two-stage dispersion polymerization" mechanism is employed to explain the formation of MMCNs. Interestingly, adding Fe3+ during the particle growing stage can obtain MMCNs-2, exhibiting uniform particle size, large specific surface area, high adsorption capacity and magnetic properties for improving the release of water-insoluble drugs such as Lovastatin (LOV).

AB Direct joining of Al back surface field (Al BSF) in a polycrystalline silicon solar cell using a green Sn-3.5Ag solder by the assistance of ultrasound was investigated. SEM, peel force, electrical resistance and open-circuit voltage (V-oc) tests were used to study the effect of ultrasonic action time on the performance of the solar cell. The results show that with the increasing of ultrasonic action time, more Al particles in the paste residual layer dissolved into the solder layer. The dissolved Al existed in the bond metal as forms of alpha-Al and Ag-Al compound phases. The solder bonded directly with the Al-Si eutectic layer under ultrasonic action time of 6 s. The resistance of the joints was 1.27 m Omega and the peel force could reach as high as similar to 1.44 N/mm. The V-oc of solar cell was 524 mV, which was higher than the 467 mV of solar cell soldered with Ag electrode. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A ZnSe quantum dot (QDs)/g-C3N4 composite with an excellent photocatalytic activity was synthesized to degrade Ceftriaxone sodium in an aquatic environment under visible light irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the composite during antibiotic degradation could be attributed to the expanding light-harvesting scope and the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Experiments involving reactive species trapping revealed that the reactive species -OH and h(+) played major roles in Ceftriaxone sodium degradation. Recycling experiments showed that the ZnSe QDs/g-C3N4 composite was highly stable and reusable. This work provided new insights into the construction of a novel photocatalyst that removes antibiotics in aquatic environments. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Metal Injection Molding is a well-known powder metallurgy technology, which allows net-shaped parts to be produced with a high degree of automation and reduced costs in large-scale production. However, shape retention during sintering of porous parts remains a challenge. The present study demonstrates that plasma assisted debinding and sintering of injection-molded parts is a promising route for manufacturing highly porous Fe-P-based parts, improving porosity amount and dimensional accuracy, avoiding surface distortion of injection-molded parts while decreasing processing time. In this study, the effect of plasma sintering was analyzed regarding dimensional accuracy, porosity, phase composition and microstructure of highly porous Fe-2wt%P parts. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Hollow microtubule structured nano-/micromaterials of hollow tubular g-C3N4 (TCN) enwrapped with nanosheets were fabricated by a three-step method. By calcining NiCo-layered-double-hydroxides/tubu lar-cyanuric acid-melamine (NiCo-LDH/TCM) precursor prepared through using 2-methylimidazole as precipitant and methanol as solvent, the as-prepared NiCo-alloy@tubular-g-C3N4 (NC@TCN) shown excellent microwave absorption in the frequency range of 2-18 GHz. The optimal reflection loss (RL) of -35.63 dB was observed at 5.00 GHz and an effective absorption bandwidth of 4.80 GHz at a matching layer thickness of 2.0 mm. Our results indicated that the deposition of NiCo-alloy nanoparticles on g-C3N4 microtubule was an efficient way to fabricate g-C3N4-based high-performance microwave absorbers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper presents a new way to obtain collagen/hydroxyapatite (COLL/HA) composite materials by 3D printing. Because of high tendency of segregation of COLL/HA composite materials, printing was done using COLL/Ca-2(+) gel (even COLL/Ca(OH)(2)) followed by precipitation of HA and crosslinking of COLL. The HA precipitation occurs simultaneously with crosslinking of COLL molecules, these processes being assured by the presence of glutaraldehyde supplemented PBS solution. By printing with COLL/Ca-2(+) at acidic pH homogeneity was increased. FTIR spectroscopy and microscopy reveal HA formation as the main inorganic phase these nanoparticles being homogeneously dispersed in the volume. In vitro biocompatibility assays were performed on Vero cells (ISO10993-5/2009). Results show that the extract of the developed biomaterial in cell culture medium elicited a similar cellular response to standard culture medium demonstrating its potential for biomedical applications. The described procedure and proposed ink can be used for developing 3D bone scaffolds and open new perspectives for COLL/Ca-2(+) homogeneous inks. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A facile strategy for cross-linked carbon nanotube film (CL-CNF) was carried out via self-assembly of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which was achieved based on esterification and acylation reactions of functional CNTs respectively. Comparing with uncross-linked carbon nanotube film, this strategy could benefit for enhancing mechanical properties of CNF through altering the inter-tube interaction from weaker Van der Waals force to stronger chemical bonding, but not lost its conductivity. The tensile strength and Young's modulus of CL-CNF were remarkably enhanced, which were higher 263% and 190% than uncross-linked CNF. Meanwhile, conductivity of CNF after cross-linking increased to 210%. In this paper, the forming ester and acylation bonding in CNT network led to differences of their morphology that were observed on nanoscale. This method promoted CL-CNF as a promising material to be applied in water treatment and self-heating materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The NO2-sensing analysis revealed that the PSi/VONPs-Pd showed obviously enhanced response and selectivity towards NO2, as compared to PSi/VONPs and Si/VONPs. The maximum response of PSi/VONPs-Pd sensor was performed at RT, therefore it has great potential to be used as a RT NO2 gas sensor in practical. The mechanism of gas sensing and enhanced gas response of PSi/VONPs-Pd was discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present research is intended to provide a base for further investigation of the chemistry of whitlockites, and Zn-whitlockite, in particular. Zinc-containing whitlockite Ca10Zn10H2(PO4)(14 )was successfully prepared at room temperature by means of a chemical reaction between Ca(NO3)(2), Zn(NO3)(2) and (NH4)(2)HPO4 at a pH around 11.0. The X-ray pattern of the compound is that of magnesium-iron whitlockite Ca-18(Mg,Fe)(2)H-2(PO4)(14) or, in a broader aspect, solid solutions of the composition Ca-20 xMex2+H2(PO4)(14), structurally related to tricalcium phosphate. It is suggested that the compound, alone or as an additive to hydroxyapatite, might be suitable for the preparation of biodegradable orthopedic implants containing zinc. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx) was grafted with N-carboxyanhydrides (NCA) to synthesize amino acid modified co-polymer. FT-IR and elemental analysis confirmed that amino acids were successfully grafted into PHBHHx with various NCA monomer. The hydrophilicity of modified PHBHHx was significantly enhanced by the amino acid segment incorperation, and the controlled trials revealed that the physical added amino acids in SBF solution almost display nearly no influence on PHBHHx degradation while the chemically grafted amino acids in co-polymers significantly promote PHBHHx degradation.

AB Here we report a highly active catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) that is constructed by in situ growth of MoS2 on the surface of MoSe2 nanosheets (MoSe2@MoS2). Compared with either single MoSe2@MoS2, the MoSe2@MoS2 electrocatalyst exhibits better electrocatalytic activity with a small Tafel slope (60 mV dec(-1)) and a low onset overpotential (-161 mV). The good HER activity is attributed to its core-shell nanostructure, which can not only efficaciously suppress the aggregation of MoS2 nanosheets, but also generate more active sites and produce a synergistic effect of the two components in the HER. This approach provides an effective pathway to improve HER activity of MoSe2@MoS2 catalysts and can be used for other two-dimensional semiconductor electrocatalyst. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A great amount of wool wastes are produced every year in the world, leading to the discard of keratin resources and causing environmental pollution. The recycling of wool is of great significance for the application of keratin. In this work, the dissolution of wool in a benign choline chloride/oxalic acid (ChCl-OA) deep eutectic solvent (DES) solvent was presented, and the dissolution conditions were discussed. After dissolution, keratin was separated by dialysis, filtration and freeze-drying. The resulting keratin powder was characterized by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry/differential scanning calorimeter, protein electrophoresis, scanning electron microscope, and amino acid analysis. The optimized dissolution conditions were the following: ChCl-OA molar ratio 1:2; wool-DES weight ratio 5%; 110-125 degrees C; 2 h. In the dissolution process, the disulfide bonds of wool molecules were broken, and the a-helix structure of wool was destroyed. The molecular weight of the as-prepared keratin was between 3.3 kDa and 7.8 kDa, and the freeze-dried keratin displayed flake structures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The production of metallic parts via laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF) additive manufacturing is rapidly growing. To use components produced via L-PBF in safety-critical applications, a high degree of confidence is required in their quality. This qualification can be supported by means of a validated thermomechanical model capable of predicting the final residual stress state and subsequent performance. In this work, we use high-energy X-ray diffraction to determine a three-dimensional residual strain and stress state in a Ti-6Al-4V L-PBF component. The experimental results are used to provide validation of simulations, showing strong quantitative agreement. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bovine theileriosis, caused by Theileria orientalis, is endemic from East Asia to Oceania. Even though the disease is mainly transmitted by Haemaphysalis ticks, the T. orientalis parasite can also be transmitted vertically. To develop proper control measures, the frequency of each transmission route must be elucidated. However, the frequency of vertical transmission, including transplacental transmission, of T. orientalis in naturally infected cattle is still controversial. This study aimed to clarify the frequency of the vertical transmission of T. orientalis in naturally infected cattle. Blood samples were collected from 204 T. orientalis-infected dams and their 211 newborn calves (including 7 sets of twins) within the first 24 h as well as 30 days after birth. Furthermore, 31 and 24 calves born to T. orientalis-infected and uninfected dams, respectively, were continuously surveyed for infection until 5 months of age. A total of 5 (2.4%) dams were diagnosed with mild anemia, whereas most of the dams were asymptomatic based on hematological examination and clinical signs. PCR analysis was performed on whole blood to determine the presence of T. orientalis in calves, and no calves were PCR positive 0 and 30 days after birth. However, 9.6% and 0% of the calves bom to T. orientalis-infected and uninfected dams, respectively, tested positive at 3 and 5 months of age. The sampled calves were fed in-house, and the survey was conducted during the cold season; thus, horizontal transmission through blood-sucking insects rarely occurred. Therefore, the vertical transmission of T. orientalis took as long as 3 months to become detectable by PCR and occurred in approximately 10% of field cattle.

AB Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus is one of the most important ectoparasites in cattle breeding worldwide, causing direct and indirect losses to animals and producers. Chemical acaricides are utilized in the control of cattle tick and the increase in the development of resistance by ectoparasites makes new alternative necessary. Therefore, research studies have been carried out using bioactive molecules that are quickly degraded and that reduce poisoning to appliers and non-target organisms, environmental contamination and development of resistance. Thus, this study aimed to isolate piperovatine from the roots of Piper corcovadensis, a native species to Brazil, and to evaluate the larvicidal activity against Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus by larval packet test and in ex situ in an open environment. Piperovatine was isolated by classical column chromatography, and identified by H-1 and C-13 NMR. The lethal concentration (LC) of piperovatine that killed 50% (LC50) and 99% (LC99) of the larvae was determined by Probit analysis. The results indicated LC50 5.17 and LC99 25.41 mu g/mL. LC99 was tested in ex situ in an open environment, and an efficiency of 96.63% was found, indicating that piperovatine kept the larvicidal action determined in in vitro test and in open environment. Therefore, this study shows new perspectives to develop products that can be applied in natural conditions to control this ectoparasite.

AB The best preventive strategy for canine leishmaniasis is, to date, unknown. In the last few years, new preventive measures have become available in Europe, including vaccination against leishmaniasis and the use of domperidone. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the different preventive measures available against leishmaniasis in client-owned dogs.
   A database search of medical records was carried out in 52 private veterinary practices located in endemic areas of canine leishmaniasis in Spain, Italy and Portugal. Healthy seronegative dogs were included in the study. Serology was repeated at least 6 months later, and was used to retrospectively classify dogs into healthy, infected or sick.
   A total of 1647 dogs were included in the study. The use of preventive measures in this population was widespread. The single most utilized measure was repellents alone in 45.7% of dogs, followed by the combination of repellents and vaccination in 23.0%, repellents and domperidone in 11.3%, vaccination alone in 4.2%, vaccination and domperidone in 2.7%, domperidone alone in 2.3%, and the combination of the three measures in 0.2% of dogs. No preventive measure was applied in 10.7% dogs.
   The incidence of clinical leishmaniasis in the group with no preventive treatment applied was 12.5%. In the groups where prevention was applied, the reported incidence was the following: 10.1% for the vaccination only group, 4.5% for repellents only group, 4.0% for repellents + vaccination group, and 0.5% for repellents + domperidone group. No dogs in the groups of domperidone, vaccination + domperidone, and combination of the three measures developed clinical leishmaniasis. All preventive measures resulted in a significantly lower incidence of leishmaniasis compared to not applying any measure, except for vaccination alone. The majority of preventive strategies used, with exception of vaccination alone, decreased the incidence of leishmaniasis significantly.
   Adverse events, mild and self-limiting in most of the cases, were reported in 5.2% of dogs and were significantly more common in dogs following vaccination.
   In conclusion, this is the first large-scale field study investigating the efficacy and safety of the preventive measures used routinely against leishmaniasis in client-owned dogs. Most preventive strategies used, with exception of vaccination alone, had some benefit over not applying any preventive. In this field study, the use of repellents showed a good degree of protection in dogs living in endemic areas of canine leishmaniasis. Although lower numbers of dogs are included, the use of domperidone appeared to provide additional protection. The role of vaccination and its combination with other preventive strategies needs further study.

AB Psoroptic mange is an important parasitic disease that mainly affects beef cattle producing marked economic losses. Ivermectin (IVM) is considered one of the most effective treatments against psoroptic mange and is used worldwide to control both endo and ectoparasites in different species. The current work assessed the relationship between pharmacokinetic behavior of IVM and its efficacy against Psoroptes ovis after the subcutaneous administration of two commercial formulations in a cattle feedlot. Aberdeen Angus and Hereford steers were selected based on the presence of active mite infestations. Animals were allocated into 4 experimental groups and treated with a single (day 0) or repeated subcutaneous injection (days 0 and 7) of one of two commercial formulations of IVM (1%) at 0.2 mg/kg. Blood and skin samples were taken from 8 randomly selected animals of each experimental group to measure IVM concentrations by HPLC. Skin scrapings were also collected from six different sites in each animal, mites were counted and ranked based on a density score. Equivalent plasma concentrations of IVM were measured after the administration of IVM formulations under study. The repeated administration of both IVM formulations at day 0 and 7 accounted for a greater plasma drug availability compared with the single administration (P<0.05). IVM was well distributed from the plasma to the skin without significant differences between both IVM formulations. There was a positive correlation between IVM concentrations in skin and plasma (r: 0.73 P<0.0001). The mean ratios between IVM availabililty (measured as AUC) in the skin and in plasma were between 1.2 and 2.1. The repeated administration of IVM increased significantly the IVM concentrations in the skin of areas affected by mange. IVM failed to obtain a parasitological cure in the different groups affected by mange. The failure was observed with both formulations administered at single or repeated doses. Based on the number of animals cured, the range of efficacy was between 0% on day 7 and 60% on day 28 post-treatment. No significant differences in the P. ovis density scores were observed after the IVM treatment at single or repeated doses. Additional studies are needed to confirm the presence of resistant strains of P.ovis and to establish the appropriate measures to control these parasitic infestations in feedlot cattle.

AB The leaf latex of Aloe yavellana Reynolds is traditionally used for the treatment of various illnesses of humans and domestic animals in Ethiopia. In the present study, the latex and two major compounds isolated from it, namely, aloin A/B and microdontin A/B were assessed for their larvicidal activity against Amblyomma variegatum tick larvae using a larval packet test (LPT). The LC50 and LC99 of the latex were found to be 35.82 +/- 2.27 and 83.48 +/- 3.95 mg/ml, respectively. Although microdontin A/B showed better larvicidal activity (LC50 = 89.40 +/- 4.45 mg/ml) than aloin A/B (LC50 = 257.69 +/- 6.31 mg/ml), neither of the isolated compounds was as active as the latex suggesting that the compounds acted synergistically or minor compounds with potent larvicidal activity may exist in the latex. The results confirmed that the leaf latex of A. yavellana and its isolated compounds could have the potential to be used as larvicidal against A. variegatum ticks.

TI Validation of a new experimental model for assessing drug efficacy

ID BRUCEI; BRAIN
AB Trypanosoma equiperdum, the causative agent of dourine, may affect the central nervous system, leading to neurological signs in infected horses. This location protects the parasite from most (if not all) existing chemotherapies. In this context, the OIE terrestrial code considers dourine as a non-treatable disease and imposes a stamping-out policy for affected animals before a country may achieve its dourine-free status. The use of practices as drastic as euthanasia remains controversial, but the lack of a suitable tool for studying a treatment's efficacy against dourine hampers the development of an alternative strategy for dourine infection management. The present study reports on the development of an experimental infection model for assessing drug efficacy against the nervous form of dourine. The model combines the infection of horses by Trypanosoma equiperdum and the search for trypanosomes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through an ultrasound-guided cervical sampling protocol.
   After a development phase involving four horses, we established an infection model that consists of inoculating 5 x 10(4) T. equiperdum OVI parasites intravenously into adult Welsh mares (Equus caballus). To evaluate its efficacy, eight horses were infected according to this model. In all these animals, parasites were observed in the blood at 2 days post-inoculation (p.i.) and in CSF (12.5 +/- 1.6 days p.i.) and seroconversion was detected (8.25 +/- 0.5 days p.i.). All eight animals also developed fever (rectal temperature > 39 degrees C), low hematocrit (< 27%), and ventral edema (7.9 +/- 2.0 days p.i.), together with other inconstant clinical signs such as edema of the vulva (six out of eight horses) or cutaneous plaques (three out of eight horses).
   This model provides a robust infection protocol that induces an acute trypanosome infection and that allows parasites to be detected in the CSF of infected horses within a period of time compatible with animal experimentation constraints. We conclude that this model constitutes a suitable tool for analyzing the efficacy of anti-Trypanosoma drugs and vaccines.

AB Until the discovery of Toxoplasma gondii oocysts in cat feces in 1970, little was known of coccidiosis in cats. Until 1970, three coccidian parasites based on different sized oocysts were recognized, the parasite with large oocysts (similar to 40 mu m long and called Isospora fells), medium sized oocysts (similar to 25 mu m long, called Isospora rivolta), and small sized oocysts (14 mu m or less, called Isospora bigemina) were known and they were considered not host-specific. Later, it was demonstrated that these parasites were host-specific and had also extra-intestinal stages. The Isospora bigemina turned out to be more than 25 organisms belonging to T. gondii, Hammondia spp., Sarcocystis spp., Besnoitia spp., and Neospora spp.; these subjects have been reviewed previously in detail. The present paper summarizes biology of Isospora felis, and I. rivolta (now transferred to genus Cystoisospora), including taxonomy, life cycle, diagnosis, and treatment. Re-excretion of T. gondii oocysts from chronically infected cats after superinfection with Cystoisospora felis oocysts is discussed. There are only two species of Cystoisospora species in cats, C. felis and C. rivolta; Isospora novocati and Cystoisospora frenkeli named for I. rivolta-like parasites of cats are considered synonym of C. rivolta. Clinical coccidiosis occurs more commonly in recently weaned kittens and C. felis infections are more prevalent than C. rivolta.

AB Cytauxzoonosis is a highly fatal disease of domestic cats caused by the apicomplexan protozoan Cytauxzoon felis, which is most closely related to Theileria spp. The growing prevalence, high morbidity and mortality, and treatment cost of cytauxzoonosis emphasize the need for vaccine development. Traditional approaches for vaccine development, however, have been hindered by the inability to culture C. felis in vitro. Recent availability of the annotated C. felis genome combined with genome-based vaccine design and protein microarray immunoscreening allowed for high-throughput identification of C. felis antigens that could serve as vaccine candidates. This study assessed the suitability of three of these vaccine candidates (cf30, cf63, cf58) in addition to a previously reported vaccine candidate (cf76) based on two criteria: genetic conservation among diverse C. felis geographic isolates and expression in tissues containing the C. felis schizont life stage, which has been previously associated with the development of a protective immune response. A comparison of seventeen C. felis isolates across seven states demonstrated high sequence identity (99-100%) for cf30, cf63, and cf58, similar to the degree of conservation previously reported for cf76. RNAscope (R) in situ hybridization using acutely infected feline splenic tissue revealed robust levels of all transcripts in the schizont life stage of the parasite. These data support the suitability of these three antigens for further investigation as vaccine candidates against cytauxzoonosis.
