AB To reduce leakage and improve service levels, water companies are increasingly using statistical models of pipe failure using infrastructure, weather and environmental data. However, these models are often built by environmental data scientists with limited in-field experience of either fixing pipes or recording data about network failures. As infrastructure data can be inconsistent, incomplete and incorrect, this disconnect between model builders and field operatives can lead to logical errors in how datasets are interpreted and used to create predictive models. An improved understanding of pipe failure can facilitate improved selection of model inputs and the modelling approach. To enable data scientists to build more accurate predictive models of pipe failure, this paper summarises typical factors influencing failure for 5 common groups of materials for water pipes: 1) cast and spun iron, 2) ductile iron, 3) steel, 4) asbestos cement, 5) polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and 6) polyethylene (PE) pipes. With an improved understanding of why and how pipes fail, data scientists can avoid misunderstanding and misusing infrastructure and environmental data, and build more accurate models of infrastructure failure.

AB Chlorination and ozonation of various waters may be associated with the formation of toxic disinfection byproducts (DBPs) and cause health risks to humans. Monitoring the toxicity of chlorinated and ozonated water and identification of different toxicity mechanisms are therefore required. This study is one of its kind to examine the toxic effects of chlorinated and ozonated wastewater effluents on three genetically modified bioluminescent bacteria, in comparison to the naturally isolated cyanobacteria, Spirulina strains as test systems. Three different secondary wastewater effluents were collected from treatment plants, chlorinated using sodium hypochlorite (at 1 and 10 mg L-1 of chlorine) or treated using 3-4 mg L-1 of ozone at different contact times. As compared to cyanobacterial Spirulina sp., the genetically modified bacteria enhancing bioluminescence at the presence of stress agents demonstrated greater sensitivity to the toxicity induction and have also provided mechanism-specific responses associated with genotoxicity, cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in wastewater effluents. Effects of effluent chlorination time and chlorine concentration revealed by means of bioluminescent bacteria suggest the formation of genotoxic and cytotoxic DBPs followed with their possible disappearance at longer times. Ozonation could degrade genotoxic compounds in some effluents, but the cytotoxic potential of wastewater effluents may certainly increase with ozonation time. No induction of ROS-related toxicity was detected in either chlorinated or ozonated wastewater effluents. UV absorbance- and fluorescence emission-based spectroscopic characteristics may be variously correlated with changes in genotoxicity in ozonated effluents, however, no associations were obtained in chlorinated wastewater effluents. The bacterial response to the developed mechanism-specific toxicity differs among wastewater effluents, reflecting variability in effluent compositions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Surface waters are essential natural resources. They are also receiving waters for a variety of anthropogenic waste streams that carry a myriad of pollutants including pathogens. Watershed and fate and transport models can help inform the spatial and temporal extent of microbial pollution from point and non-point sources and thus provide useful information for managing surface waters. Viruses are particularly important water-related pathogens because they often have a low infectious dose, which means that ingestion of even a small volume of water containing a low concentration of virions has the potential to cause disease. We conducted a systematic review of the literature, following best practices, to gather decay rate constants (k) of mammalian waterborne viruses (enteroviruses, adenoviruses, noroviruses, astroviruses, rotaviruses, and hepatitis A viruses) and coliphages in raw surface waters to aid in the parameterization of virus fate and transport models. We identified 562 k values from the literature, with the largest number identified for enteroviruses and coliphages and the smallest for astrovirus, hepatitis A virus, and norovirus. Average k values for each virus varied from 0.07 to 0.9 per day, in order from smallest to largest: Norwalk virus (i.e., noroviruses) < Human astrovirus < Mastadenovirus (i.e., adenoviruses) < Hepatovirus A (i.e., hepatitis A viruses) < Rotavirus A < coliphages < Enterovirus. A meta analysis investigated how k varied among viruses for experiments conducted with different virus serotypes or species at different temperatures, salinities, and sunlight exposures, and for experiments that enumerated viruses using different methodologies. Virus species or serotype did not affect k among decay experiments. k values were generally larger for experiments conducted at higher temperatures, in sunlight, and in estuarine waters, and enumerated using culture methods. k values were statistically different between virus types with Norwalk virus, Hepatovirus A, and Mastadenovirus having smaller k values than other viruses, controlling for experimental condition and enumeration method. While F+ coliphage k values were similar to those of Enterovirus, Human astrovirus, and Rotavirus A, they were different from those of the other mammalian viruses. This compilation of coliphage and mammalian virus k values provides essential information for researchers and risk assessors who model virus fate and transport in surface waters and identifies avenues for future research to fill knowledge gaps.

AB Elucidating the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of anammox granular sludge is important for stable nitrogen removal processes in wastewater treatment. However, due to a lack of standardized methods for extraction and characterization, the composition of anammox granule EPS remains mostly unknown. In this study, alkaline (NaOH) and ionic liquid (IL) extractions were compared in terms of the proteins they extracted from different "Candidatus Brocadia" cultures. We aimed to identify structural proteins and evaluated to which extend these extraction methods bias the outcome of EPS characterization. Extraction was focussed on solubilization of the EPS matrix, and the NaOH and IL extraction recovered on average 20% and 26% of the VSS, respectively. Using two extraction methods targeting different intermolecular interactions increased the possibility of identifying structural extracellular proteins. Of the extracted proteins, similar to 40% were common between the extraction methods. The high number of common abundant proteins between the extraction methods, illustrated how extraction biases can be reduced when solubility of the granular sludge is enhanced. Physicochemical analyses of the granules indicated that extracellular structural matrix proteins likely have beta-sheet dominated secondary structures. These beta-sheet structures were measured in EPS extracted with both methods. The high number of uncharacterized proteins and possible moonlighting proteins confounded identifying structural (i.e. beta-sheet dominant) proteins. Nonetheless, new candidates for structural matrix proteins are described. Further current bottlenecks in assigning specific proteins to key extracellular functions in anammox granular sludge are discussed. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Past waterborne outbreaks have demonstrated that informed vulnerability assessment of drinking water supplies is paramount for the provision of safe drinking water. Although current monitoring frameworks are not designed to account for short-term peak concentrations of fecal microorganisms in source waters, the recent development of online microbial monitoring technologies is expected to fill this knowledge gap. In this study, online near real-time monitoring of beta-D-glucuronidase (GLUC) activity was conducted for 1.5 years at an urban drinking water intake impacted by multiple point sources of fecal pollution. Parallel routine and event-based monitoring of E. coli and online measurement of physico-chemistry were performed at the intake and their dynamics compared over time. GLUC activity fluctuations ranged from seasonal to hourly time scales. All peak contamination episodes occurred between late fall and early spring following intense rainfall and/or snowmelt. In the absence of rainfall, recurrent daily fluctuations in GLUC activity and culturable E. coli were observed at the intake, a pattern otherwise ignored by regulatory monitoring. Cross-correlation analysis of time series retrieved from the drinking water intake and an upstream Water Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF) demonstrated a hydraulic connection between the two sites. Sewage by-passes from the same WRRF were the main drivers of intermittent GLUC activity and E. coli peaks at the drinking water intake following intense precipitation and/or snowmelt. Near real-time monitoring of fecal pollution through GLUC activity enabled a thorough characterization of the frequency, duration and amplitude of peak contamination periods at the urban drinking water intake while providing crucial information for the identification of the dominant upstream fecal pollution sources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a hydraulic connection between a WRRF and a downstream drinking water intake across hourly to seasonal timescales using high frequency microbial monitoring data. Ultimately, this should help improve source water protection through catchment mitigation actions, especially in a context of de facto wastewater reuse. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ferric salt dosing is widely used to mitigate sulfide and methane emissions from sewers. In gravity sewers with sediments, responses of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and methanogenic archaea (MA) residing in different zones to Fe3+ dosing strategies still remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the changes in behavior of SRB and MA in different depths of sewer sediment using laboratory-scale sewer sediment reactors with different Fe3+ dosing strategies (different instant dosages and frequencies). All Fe3+ dosing strategies examined efficiently suppressed sulfide concentration for a short time, but the control mechanisms were different. When a low-dosage, high-frequency Fe3+ dosing strategy was employed, Fe3+ could not penetrate into the sewer sediment, therefore, the abundances of SRB and MA in all zones of sewer sediment did not change substantially. As a result, the active sulfide-producing and methane-producing zones kept unchanged. Sulfide was controlled mainly via chemical sulfide oxidation and precipitation, and methane formation was not influenced. In contrast, when a high-dosage, low-frequency Fe3+ dosing strategy was used, the SRB activity in the upper layer of the sewer sediment was nearly fully suppressed according to the down moving zones of sulfide production (from 0-5 mm to 20-25 mm) and lower sulfate reduction, in which sulfate reduction decreased by 56% in the long-term trial. The generated sulfide was further removed via chemical sulfide oxidation and precipitation. This strategy also significantly suppressed MA activity (21% reduction in methane production). However, considering a long-term satisfactory sulfide control, a low operational cost and less sediments deposited in gravity sewers, a low-dosage, high-frequency Fe3+ dosing strategy would be a more cost-effective solution for sulfide control in gravity sewers with thin (<20 mm) or thick (>20 mm) sediments if methane mitigation does not need to be taken into account.

AB N-nitrosamines in water have drawn significant concerns for the health of water consumers due to their carcinogenic properties. N-nitrosamines are formed during disinfection of wastewater as well as different industrial and agricultural processes. This study characterized the N-nitrosamines compositions in eleven different wastewaters in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in Southeast China, and the spatial distributions and the abundances of N-nitrosamines in the Pearl River water were detected. The results indicated that five N-nitrosamines species, including N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitro-sodiethylamine (NDEA), N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR), N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) and N-nitro-sodibutylamine (NDBA) were found in the industrial wastewater samples in the PRD. Remarkably high concentrations of NDMA (up to 4000 ng/L) were found in the wastewaters from the textile printing and dyeing as well as the electroplating, whereas NDMA, NDEA and NMOR were detected in the domestic wastewaters at concentrations lower than 15 ng/L. Moreover, we found that certain treatment processes for the electroplating wastewater could form a significant amount of NDMA, NPYR and NMOR. Analyses of the Pearl River water samples showed occurrences of different N-nitrosamines species, including NDMA (5.7 ng/L), NDEA (1.7 ng/L), NPYR (2.2 ng/L), NMOR (2.2 ng/L) and NDBA (4.9 ng/L). The abundances of N-nitrosamines species varied spatially due to the inputs from the different sources. Thus, our study provides unique and valuable information for occurrences, abundances and source characteristics of N-nitrosamines in the PRD. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of fi-estradiol (E2) and alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in biological wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) would need to be improved in order to comply with prospective Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) of 0.4 and 0.035 ng.L-1 respectively. The effluent concentration of a micropollutant in an activated sludge process is a function of the removal rate, the hydraulic retention time (HRT) and the flow pattern, which is usually overlooked. In order to better understand this aspect, we carried out tracer studies in eight WWTPs in the UK and found that relatively modest changes in aeration tanks would translate into tangible improvements in their flow pattern. We further evaluated the degradation rates for El (estrone), E2, E3 (estriol) and EE2 in each WWTP and we estimated that the modification of the flow pattern would be sufficient to place effluent concentrations of E2 (23.2 L.giA " d(-1)<kbio<210 L"gi,7s " d-1) far below the prospective EQS, while EE2 (0.3 L"gcts"d-1<kbia<2.9 L"gis"c1-1) would have to rely on river dilution for compliance. Regarding El and E3, with no prospective legislation, the modifications would place E3 (9.9 L"girils " id-1<kbio<39.5 L"gris"c1-1) effluent concentrations easily below its predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC = 60 ng.L-1) while for El, (2.6 L " gc,Is " d(-1)<kbio<19.2 L"Zis " c1-1) it would very much depend on the degradation rates of the specific WWTP (PNEC = 6 ng.1.-1). Improvement in flow pattern had the additional benefit of improving the effectiveness of other plausible changes in HRT or biological removal rates. Managing the flow pattern of existing WWTPs is a cost-efficient tool for managing the fate of estrogens. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Filamentous fungi (ff) are consistently recognized as drinking water (DW) inhabitants, typically harboured in biofilms. Their sessile behaviour is still poorly understood. This study aimed the evaluation of the influence of several abiotic factors (substratum, hydrodynamic conditions and nutrient availability) on biofilm formation by Penicillium brevicompactum and P. expansum isolated from DW. Fungal adhesion was quantified on high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) surfaces using synthetic tap water (STW) and R2A broth, under stagnant or agitated (25 and 150 rpm) conditions. Fungal spore numbers were assessed after staining with Calcofluor White MR2 and epifluorescence microscopy. The surface charge and physicochemical properties of spores were characterized for a mechanistic understanding on the adhesion process. The adhesion kinetics of spores was represented accurately by the Logistic model, in which adhesion increased with time until a maximum level attained before spore germination (8 h after incubation). In general, P. brevicompactum demonstrated to adhere in a higher extent than P. expansum (12 x 10(4) spores/cm(2) vs 1.7 x 10(4) spores/cm(2)). Moreover, fungal adhesion was potentiated under stagnation and using R2A broth. HDPE and PVC allowed spore adhesion at similar extents. Adhesion predictions based on the extended Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey and Overbeek (XDLVO) theory corroborated the experimental results, highlighting the role of physicochemical surface properties on the adhesion of spores. These results allowed to refine a model for ff biofilm formation. The overall results help to understand key aspects determining the presence of P. brevicompactum and P. expansum biofilms in DW, where stagnant conditions and the presence of nutrients should be avoided to prevent ff biofilm formation.

AB N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is found in groundwater and drinking water from industrial, agricultural, water treatment, and military/aerospace sources, and it must often be treated to part-per-trillion (ng/L) concentrations. The most effective remedial technology for NDMA in groundwater is pump-and-treat with ultraviolet irradiation (UV), but this approach is expensive because it requires ex situ infrastructure and high energy input. The objective of this project was to evaluate an in situ biological treatment approach for NDMA. Previous laboratory studies have revealed that propane-oxidizing bacteria are capable of biodegrading NDMA from mu g/L to low ng/L concentrations (Fournier et al., 2009; Webster et al., 2013). During this field study, air and propane gas were sparged into an NDMA-contaminated aquifer for more than 1 year. Groundwater samples were collected throughout the study from a series of monitoring wells within, downgradient, and sidegradient of the zone of influence of the biosparge system. Over the course of the study, NDMA concentrations declined by 99.7% to >99.9% in the four monitoring wells within the zone of influence of the biosparge system, reaching low ng/L concentrations whereas the control well declined by only 14%. Pseudo first-order degradation rate constants for NDMA in system monitoring wells ranged from -0.019 day(-1) to 0.037 day(-1) equating to half-lives ranging from 19 to 36 days. Native propanotrophs increased by more than one order of magnitude in the propane-impacted wells but not in the control well. The field data show for the first time that propane biosparging can be an effective in situ approach to reduce the concentrations of NDMA in a groundwater to ng/L concentrations.

AB This paper focused on the performance of an up-flow bio-electrochemical system (UBES) for treating the 3-lactams pharmaceutical wastewater under different hydraulic retention time (HRT). UBES is added a bio-electrochemical system below the three-phase separator based on up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB). Comparisons of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, accumulation of volatile fatty acid (VFA) and biogas production were investigated during the 316-day operation time, which was divided into five parts with HRT of 96 h, 72 h, 48 h, 36 h and 20 h, respectively. The average COD removal efficiency of UBES could reach 45.3 +/- 7.5%, 72.2 +/- 3.5%, 86.2 +/- 1.4%, 75.9 +/- 1.8% and 64.9 +/- 2.0%, which were 2.4%, 6.1%, 6.4%, 10.2%, 8.7% more than those of UASB under different HRTs, respectively. Biogas production as well as methane production of UBES were significantly higher than UASB during the whole changing HRT process, the maximum methane yield of UBES was 0.31 +/- 0.07 L/gCOD(removed). Accumulation of VFA in UBES was discovered to be lighter than UASB, the minimum average VFA in UBES was 131.9 +/- 18.5 mg/L, which was obtained at HRT of 48 h. These results proved that UBES can slow down the inhibition of VFA on methanogens to make sure a good performance on COD removal and biogas production than UASB. Moreover, the relationships between methane production and VFA, biogas production and COD consumption were analyzed. A cost and benefit were analyzed for evaluating the potential of UBES in practical applications compared with UASB. Finally, radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) model was developed and fitted well with the experimental data, which can be employed to predict the effluent quality of the UBES and UASB.

AB Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been increasingly used for the treatment of source waters and wastewaters. AOPs characteristically produce oxidation byproducts (OBPs) from the partial degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and/or the transformation of inorganic ions (especially, halides) into highly toxic substances including bromate and halogenated organic OBPs (X-OBPs). However, despite the enormous health and environmental risks posed by X-OBPs, an integral understanding of the complex OBP formation mechanisms during AOPs is lacking, which limits the development of safe and effective ADP-based water treatment schemes. The present critical and comprehensive review was intended to fill in this important knowledge gap. The study shows, contrary to the hitherto prevailing opinion, that the direct incorporation of halide atoms (X-center dot) into DOM makes an insignificant contribution to the formation of organic X-OBPs. The principal halogenating agent is hypohalous acid/hypohalite (HOX/XO-), whose control is, therefore, critical to the reduction of both organic and inorganic X-OBPs. Significant generation of X-OBPs has been observed during sulfate radical AOPs (SR-AOPs), which arises principally from the oxidizing effects of the unactivated oxidant and/or the applied catalytic activator rather than the sulfate radical as is commonly held. A high organic carbon/X- molar ratio (>5), an effective non-catalytic activator such as UV or Fe2+, a low oxidant concentration, and short treatment time are suggested to limit the accumulation of HOX/XO- and, thus, the generation of X-OBPs during SR-AOPs. At present, there are no established techniques to prevent the formation of X-OBPs during UV/chlor(am)ine AOPs because the maintenance of substantial amounts of active halogen is essential to these processes. The findings and conclusions reached in this review would advance the research and application of AOPs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fluvial networks are globally relevant for the processing of dissolved organic matter (DOM). To investigate the change in molecular DOM diversity along the river course, high-field FTICR mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy of riverine DOM as well as bacterial abundance and activity were measured in a third order stream along a land-use gradient from pristine, agricultural to urban landscapes. DOM composition showed a clear evolution along the river course with an initial decrease of average oxidation and unsaturation followed by an increased relative abundance of CHNO and CHOS compounds introduced by agriculture and waste water, respectively. DOM composition was dominated by rather unsaturated CHO compounds (H/C <= 1) in headwaters and by more aliphatic molecules at downstream sites. Oxygenated functional groups shifted from aromatic ethers and hydroxyl groups to aliphatic carboxylic acids and aliphatic hydroxyl groups. This massive dislocation of oxygen significantly increased the diversity of atomic environments in branched aliphatic groups from headwater to downstream DOM. Mass spectra of DOM enabled the detection of compositional relationships to bacterial abundance and activity which was positively related to more aliphatic components (H/C > 1) and negatively related to unsaturated components. FTICR mass and NMR spectra corroborated the initial decline in DOM molecular diversity predicted by the River Continuum Concept (RCC) but demonstrated an anthropogenic increase in the molecular diversity of DOM further downstream. While the high DOM molecular diversity in first order headwater streams was the result of small scale ecosystem plurality, agriculture and waste water treatment introduced many components in the lower reaches. These anthropogenic influences together with massive bacterial oxidation of DOM contributed to a growth of molecular diversity of downstream DOM whose composition and structure differed entirely from those found in pristine headwaters.

AB Complexing anions such as phosphate or silicate play an ambivalent role in the performance of hydrolyzing metal coagulants: On one hand, they significantly interfere with the hydrolytic pathway of conventional iron or aluminum coagulants, the associated destabilization mechanism remaining rather elusive; on the other hand, they have been shown to be key ingredients in the formulation of innovative coagulant solutions exhibiting improved removal efficiency, their action mechanism at the molecular scale being presently poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the effect of small additions of phosphate ligand on the chemical coagulation of silica nanoparticles with ferric chloride. Transmission Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersed X-ray Spectroscopy (TEM-EDXS) combined with Extended X-ray absorption Fine Structure Spectroscopy (EXAFS) at the Fe K-edge are used to provide an insight into the nature of coagulant species, whereas jar-tests, laser diffraction, Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS), and electrophoretic mobility, are used to investigate the aggregation dynamics of silica particles in the presence of phosphate ligand. We show that, in spite of a slight increase in the consumption of iron coagulant, the addition of phosphate significantly improves the formation of silica aggregates provided that the elemental Fe/P ratio remains above 7. Such effects originate from both a large increase in the overall number of coagulant species, the binding of a phosphate ligand terminating the growth of polymeric chains of edge-sharing Fe octahedra, and a change in the nature of the coagulant species that evolves with the Fe/P ratio, small polycations built-up from Fe-oligomers linked by phosphate tetrahedra being eventually formed. Those non-equilibrium nanosize Fe-P coagulant species assemble the silica nanoparticles to form hetero-aggregates whose structure is consistent with a Diffusion-Limited Cluster Aggregation mechanism.

AB Reed (Phragmites australis) is dominant vegetation in alkaline wetlands that is harvested annually due to its economic value. To reveal the effects of harvesting reeds on the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG), the annual soil physicochemical characteristics and flux of GHGs in a reed wetland without harvesting (NHRW) and with harvesting (HRW) were measured. The results showed that after the harvesting of reeds, the total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) significantly decreased, and soil temperature significantly increased. The annual cumulative N2O emissions decreased from 0.73 +/- 0.20 kg ha(-1) to 0.57 +/- 0.49 kg ha(-1) with the harvesting of reeds. The annual cumulative CH4 emissions also decreased from 561.88 +/- 18.61 kg ha(-1) to 183.13 +/- 18.77 kg ha(-1) with the harvesting of reeds. However, harvesting of reeds had only a limited influence on the annual cumulative CO2 emissions. A Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the CO2 and N2O emissions were more sensitive to temperature than the CH4 emissions. Both structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis and slurry incubation confirmed that higher temperatures offset the reduction of CO2 emissions after reed harvesting. Metagenomics showed that the abundance of functional genes involved in both GHG sink and source decreased with reed harvesting. This study presents a comprehensive view of reed harvesting on GHG emissions in alkaline wetlands, yielding new insight into the microbial response and offering a novel perspective on the potential impacts of wetland management.

AB Selenium (mainly in the forms of selenite (Se(IV)) and selenate (Se(VI)) is a regulated drinking water contaminant, but there is little information on the kinetics and mechanisms of Se(IV) oxidation during water treatment. Species-specific and apparent second-order rate constants for the oxidation of Se(IV) at pH 7.0 were determined in buffered solutions and they decrease in the order bromine (5.8 0.3 x 103 M-1 s(-1)) > ozone (03, 513.4 10.0 M-1 s(-1)) > chlorine (61.0 3.6 M-1 s(-1)) > permanganate (2.1 0.1 M-1 s(-1)), monochloramine (NH2CI, (1.3 0.1) x 10-3 M-1 s(-1)), and hydrogen peroxide (H202, (2.3 0.1) x 10-5 M-1 s(-1)). The reaction stoichiometries for the reactions of Se(IV) with bromine, 03, chlorine, NH2CI, and H202 are 1:1. For Mn(Vll), the stoichiometries varied with pH and were 5:2, 3:2, and 1:2 for acidic, neutral, and alkaline conditions, respectively. Based on the reaction orders and stoichiometries, the corresponding Se(IV) oxidation mechanisms for various oxidants are discussed. The role of bromide for Se(IV) oxidation was also investigated during chlorination and ozonation of Se(IV)containing water. During chlorination, bromide-catalysis enhances the rate of the oxidation of Se(IV) to Se(VI) from 50% to nearly 90% with bromide concentrations of 50 pig L-1 and 200 pig L-1, respectively, at pH 7.0 and a chlorine dose of 2.0 mg L-1 (within 15 min). During ozonation, bromide had no effect on Se(IV) oxidation. Based on the determined second order rate constants, the oxidation of Se(IV) by chlorine and ozone were successfully predicted in a natural water by a kinetic model. The second order rate constants for the same oxidants were also investigated and/or evaluated for other related anions, such as arsenite (As(III)) and sulfite (S(IV)). They decreased in the order S(IV)> As(III)> Se(IV). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A biomolecular-based monitoring approach for the assessment of water quality hazards and risks associated with cyanobacteria was developed and validated in drinking reservoirs in Taiwan and the Philippines. The approach was based upon the measurement of gene abundances of toxigenic Microcystis and Cylindrospermopsis; for cyanotoxins; and for aesthetically offensive earthy-musty odor compounds. This was compared to conventional monitoring approaches, which included cell enumeration by microscopy, and toxin and odor compound analysis by instrumental analytical methods and immunoassays as appropriate for the metabolites. The validation involved samples from ten major reservoirs on Taiwan's main island, nineteen reservoirs on the offshore islands, and Laguna de Bay in the Philippines. The gene-based approach was successfully validated statistically and compared to conventional widely utilized risk assessment schemes which have employed 'Alert Levels' for toxic cyanobacteria. In this case a new integrated scheme of 'Response Levels' is proposed which incorporates odor metabolite hazards in addition to cyanotoxins and is based upon gene copy numbers to derive quantitative triggers. The comprehensive scheme evaluated from these locations is considered to be more precise and efficient for both monitoring and as a risk assessment diagnostic tool, given that it offers the capacity for analysis of the abundance of genes for cyanobacterial metabolites in large numbers of natural water samples in a significantly reduced period of time compared to the approaches of cell enumeration by microscopy or metabolite analytical techniques. This approach is the first time both the hazard and risk for both odors and cyanotoxins from cyanobacteria have been considered together in a monitoring scheme and offers an improved means for determining the Response Levels in the risk assessment process for cyanobacteria and their metabolites in drinking water sources.

AB Sewage sludge (SS) alkaline fermentation (especially at pH 10) can efficiently enhance volatile fatty acids (VFAs) production. VFAs are considered an excellent carbon source for the biological nutrient removal (BNR) process. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in fermentation liquid is the direct substrate used for producing VFAs and can greatly influence the effluent quality of BNR process. However, knowledge of DOM characteristics in sludge alkaline fermentation is limited. This study focused on the functional groups, fluorescent components and molecular features of DOM as well as molecular weight of proteins in SS alkaline fermentation (at pH uncontrolled, 7, 8, 9 and 10). Results showed a significantly improved generation of tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like substances as well as molecular weight <1 kDa proteins (381.5 +/- 38.4 mg/L) was observed at pH 10 (p < 0.05). Further analysis of DOM molecular characteristics indicated that pH 10 resulted in the highest molecular diversity and the generation or degradation of easily biodegradable lipid-like and proteins/amino sugars-like formulas. The improved solubilization of DOM contributed to VFAs production. Meanwhile, increasing pH to 10 also promoted the release of hard-biodegradable organic matter, e.g., humic-like and lignin-like substances. Additionally, a high diversity of resistant N-containing organic molecules was generated at pH 10. Fermentation of SS at pH 10, is favored to enhance VFAs production and, can also result in a higher content of refractory DOM. This study helps to achieve a comprehensive understanding of SS alkaline fermentation and provides fundamental information for further treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We tracked intl1, a proxy for anthropogenic pollution, and an assemblage of antibiotic resistance genes associated with mobile elements and/or wastewater (bla(GEs), bla(OXA2), bla(OXA10), bla(TEM), bla(CTX-M-32) and qnrS) in treated wastewater effluents, effluent stabilization reservoirs, and along irrigation water-soil-crop continua in experimental lysimeters and large-scale commercial fields. While several of the targeted antibiotic resistance genes were profuse in effluents, there was almost no correlation between gene abundance in irrigation water and those detected in soil, and no evidence of systematic gene transfer to irrigated soil or crops. In contrast, soil intl1 abundance correlated strongly to irrigation water levels in lysimeters and sandy field soils, but this was not the case for clay-rich soils or for most of the analyzed crops, suggesting that frail may not always be a reliable marker for tracking the impact of treated wastewater irrigation. We hypothesize that "ecological boundaries" expedited by biotic and abiotic factors constrain dissemination of antibiotic resistance elements, and assert that a more holistic perception of these factors is crucial for understanding and managing antibiotic resistance dissemination.

AB 1,4-Dioxane is one of the most persistent organic micropollutants and is quite difficult to remove via conventional drinking water treatment consisting of coagulation, sedimentation, and sand filtration. Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) treatment has recently been found to show promise as a treatment method for 1,4-dioxane removal, but the associated decomposition rate of 1,4-dioxane is known to be very sensitive to water quality characteristics. Some computational models have been proposed to predict the decomposition rate of micropollutants during VUV treatment, but the effects of only bicarbonate and natural organic matter have been considered in the models. In the present study, we attempted to develop a versatile computational model for predicting the behavior of 1,4-dioxane during VUV treatment that took into account the effects of other coexisting inorganic ions commonly found in natural waters. We first conducted 1,4-dioxane decomposition experiments with low-pressure mercury lamps and test waters that had been prepared by adding various inorganic ions to an aqueous phosphate buffer. The apparent decomposition rate of 1,4-dioxane was suppressed when bicarbonate, chloride, and nitrate were added to the test waters. Whereas bicarbonate and chloride directly suppressed the apparent decomposition rate by consuming HO center dot, nitrate became influential only after being transformed into nitrite by concomitant UV light (lambda= 254 nm) irradiation. Cl-related radicals (Cl center dot and Cl-2 center dot(-)) did not react with 1,4-dioxane directly. A computational model consisting of 31 ordinary differential equations with respect to time that had been translated from 84 reactions (10 photochemical and 74 chemical reactions) among 31 chemical species was then developed for predicting the behavior of 1,4-dioxane during VUV treatment. Nine of the parameters in the ordinary differential equations were determined by least squares fitting to an experimental dataset that included different concentrations of bicarbonate, chloride, nitrate, and nitrite. Without further parameter adjustments, the model successfully predicted the behavior of 1,4-dioxane during VUV treatment of three groundwaters naturally contaminated with 1,4-dioxane as well as one dechlorinated tap water sample supplemented with 1,4-dioxane.

AB Anticancer drugs are among the most toxic chemicals, which are commercially produced; therefore, their release in aquatic ecosystems raised concerns in regard to potential adverse effects. This article describes the results of risk assessments concerning their environmental safety, which are based on data generated in the frame of a coordinated EU project ("Cytothreat"). Eight research institutions participated in the project and four widely used anticancer drugs with different mechanisms of therapeutic action (5-fluorouracil 5FU, cisplatin CDDP, imatinib mesylate IM and etoposide ET) were tested in a variety of indicator organisms (cyanobacteria, algae, higher plants, rotifers, crustacea, fish and also in human and fish derived cell lines) in acute/subacute/chronic toxicity assays. Furthermore, genotoxic effects in micronucleus assays, single cell gel electrophoresis experiments and gamma H2AX tests were studied in plants, crustacea, fish and in various cell lines. We used the results to calculate the predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC) and risk quotients (RQ) by comparing PNEC with predicted environmental concentrations (PEC values) and measured concentrations (MEC) in wastewaters. The most sensitive species in experiments concerning acute toxic and long term effects were in general crustacea (daphnids) after chronic treatment the most pronounced effects were detected with IM followed by CDDP and 5FU. Comparisons between PNEC and PEC values indicate that it is unlikely that the release of these drugs in the aquatic environments leads to adverse effects (RQ values < 1). However, when the assessments were performed with MEC found in highly contaminated municipal wastewaters and hospital effluents, RQ values were obtained which are indicative for moderate adverse effects of IM. Calculations with data from genotoxicity experiments and PEC values are indicative for increased RQ values for all compounds except ET. The most sensitive species were fish (Danio rerio) which were highly responsive towards 5FU and daphnids which were sensitive towards CDDP and IM. When environmental data (from waste waters) were used for the calculations, high RQ values (>100) were obtained for CDDP and IM. These overall conclusions were not substantially altered when the effects of other frequently used cytostatic drugs and combined effects of mixtures of anticancer drugs were taken into consideration. The results of these assessments underline the importance of efficient removal of these chemicals by improved sewage treatment strategies and the need for further investigations of adverse the long term effects of cytostatics in aquatic biota as a consequence of damage of the genetic material in highly sensitive species.

AB Activated carbon is the most common electrode material used in electrosorption processes such as water desalination with capacitive deionization (CDI). CDI is a cyclic process to remove ions from aqueous solutions by transferring charge from one electrode to another. When multiple salts are present in a solution, the removal of each ionic species can be different, resulting in selective ion separations. This ion selectivity is the result of combined effects, such as differences in the hydrated size and valence of the ions. In the present work, we study ion selectivity from salt mixtures with two different monovalent ions, chloride and nitrate. We run adsorption experiment in microporous carbons (i.e., without applying a voltage), as well as electrosorption experiments (i.e., based on applying a voltage between two carbon electrodes). Our results show that i) during adsorption and electrosorption, activated carbon removes much more nitrate than chloride; ii) at equilibrium, ion selectivity does not depend strongly on the composition of the water, but does depend on charging voltage in CDI; and iii) during electrosorption, ion selectivity is time-dependent. We modify the amphoteric Donnan model by including an additional affinity of nitrate to carbon. We find good agreement between our experimental results and the theory. Both show very high selectivity towards nitrate over chloride, beta(-)(NO3)(/Cl)- similar to 10, when no voltage is applied, or when the voltage is low. The selectivity gradually decreases with increasing charging voltage to beta(-)(NO3)(/Cl)- similar to 6 at V-ch = 1.2 V. Despite this decrease, the affinity-effect for nitrate continues to play an important role also at a high voltage. In general, we can conclude that our work provides new insights in the importance of carbon-ion interactions for electrochemical water desalination. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB An immobilized photoactive TiO2 coating grown directly on titanium meshes was successfully exploited for the electrochemical photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine in real secondary wastewater effluent. The catalyst was prepared by Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation and during the photocatalytic water treatment an electrical polarization (bias) was applied to the catalyst. The investigated process was compared with the conventional one employing suspended TiO2 powder (Degussa P25). Results showed that carbamazepine degradation rate follows the order UV/supported TiO2+bias approximate to UV/TiO2 Degussa P25 > UV/supported TiO2 > UV. The investigation also included the identification of other micropollutants and degradation products. This allowed the detection of 201 compounds present in the secondary wastewater effluent employed for the photocatalysis tests, 51 of them also successfully associated to compounds of emerging concern (CECs), and 194 to transformation products (TPs). The degradation of detected compounds followed first-order kinetics and the mean kinetic constant values of the 51 CECs resulted to be 0.048, 0.035 and 0.043 min(-1) for the TiO2+Bias + UV, TiO2+UV and UV, respectively. As for TPs, results showed that the TiO2+Bias + UV treatment is much more efficient than both TiO2+UV and UV in minimizing the intensity of the organics in the real wastewater. Such a better performance was more pronounced at higher reaction time reaching 60% reduction of mean peak area of TPs at 90 min of reaction. Among the detected TPs also compounds belonging to known carbamazepine TPs were found. This allowed to propose a degradation pathway of carbamazepine. The supported catalyst was positively tested for 15 cycles demonstrating that it has the potential to be used in real wastewater tertiary steps aimed at removing CECs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB High-solids anaerobic digestion (HS-AD) of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) is operated at a total solid (TS) content >= 10% to enhance the waste treatment economy, though it might be associated to free ammonia (NH3) inhibition. This study aimed to calibrate and cross-validate a HS-AD model for homogenized reactors in order to assess the effects of high NH3 levels in HS-AD of OFMSW, but also to evaluate the suitability of the reversible non-competitive inhibition function to reproduce the effect of NH3 on the main acetogenic and methanogenic populations. The practical identifiability of structural/biochemical parameters (i.e. 35) and initial conditions (i.e. 32) was evaluated using batch experiments at different TS and/or inoculum-to-substrate ratios. Variance-based global sensitivity analysis and approximate Bayesian computation were used for parameter optimization. The experimental data in this study permitted to estimate up to 8 biochemical parameters, whereas the rest of parameters and biomass contents were poorly identifiable. The study also showed the relatively high levels of NH3 (i.e. up to 2.3 g N/L) and ionic strength (i.e. up to 0.9 M) when increasing TS in HS-AD of OFMSW. However, the NH3 non-competitive function was unable to capture the acetogenic/methanogenic inhibition. Therefore, the calibration emphasized the need for target-oriented experimental data to enhance the practical identifiability and the predictive capabilities of structured HS-AD models, but also the need for further testing the NH3 inhibition function used in these simulations.

AB The most probable number dilution-culture assay (MPN) is used to enumerate viable phytoplankton in regulatory tests of ballast water treatment systems. However the United States Coast Guard has not yet accepted MPN, in part due to concerns of biased results due to cells being viable but not growing. MPN does not assess the fate of every cell, and thus the bias can only be evaluated by a companion method that assesses the ability of the various taxa to grow. This growth ability ("growability") is the complement of the bias, and has been evaluated by microscopic taxonomy of before-culture and after-culture samples. However, microscopic taxonomy is extremely laborious and few data have been produced for phytoplankton growability in MPN assays. To address the need for more and more reliable growability data, a method was developed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) techniques that target the V9 region of the 18S rRNA gene for the taxonomic identification and growth assessment of eukaryotic phytoplankton, respectively. This growability method was applied to MPN samples from a ballast water management system test that were incubated with two different enrichment media at two different temperatures. DNA was extracted from filters of before-culture and after-culture samples, and assessed for taxonomy by NGS and for PCR template DNA concentration by qRT-PCR. Growth ratios based on changes in 18S template concentration over the incubation period were calculated for each taxon, and dead-cell DNA persistence through a 14 day incubation was verified to be <1% and did not influence the growth calculations. In total, 95 of 97 eukaryotic phytoplankton in the before-culture sample demonstrated growth, with definitive growth ratios ranging from 4.0 x 10(1) -2.6 x 10(5). An additional 13 taxa demonstrated growth from non-detect in before-culture samples. Taxa-based growability values were 87-88% in individual incubation conditions with no statistical differences among conditions, and 98% for all conditions combined. When growability was weighted by the before-culture abundance of each taxa, relevant to regulations based on all organisms regardless of taxa, community-based growability was >99% in each condition and in all conditions combined because the most abundant taxa all exhibited growth. This study verifies that conventional phytoplankton MPN assays produce accurate results with low bias from undetected viable cells, regardless of enrichments and incubation temperatures. This work can provide regulatory confidence for broader acceptance of MPN assays without limitations. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Utilization of renewable solar energy driven advanced oxidation processes for oil sands process water (OSPW) remediation has received extensive attention. Naturally existing inorganic photosensitizer in OSPW was investigated in this work to provide information about the application of indirect photolysis treatment of organic contaminants in OSPW. OSPW and OSPW organic fraction were exposed under UV irradiance with fluence of 10 J/cm(2) to investigate the effect of OSPW inorganic fraction (OSPW-IF) on the non-catalytic photolysis of naphthenic acids (NAs) in OSPW. The results indicated that the inorganic fraction in OSPW enhanced the photodegradation of NAs, with 24.3% of total NA removal in OSPW, while only 12.4% of total NAs were removed in OSPW organic fraction. Moreover, the photodegradation of 1-adamantanecarboxylic acid (ACA) dissolved in OSPW-IF or carbonate buffer was conducted to verify the enhanced photodegradation of NAs by OSPW-IF. The results showed that 30.9% of ACA was removed in the OSPW-IF, while no ACA degradation was observed in carbonate buffer after 60 min of UV exposure, indicating that the OSPW-IF induced the photodegradation of ACA. In addition, nitrate was identified to be the photosensitizer in OSPW-IF responsible for the indirect photolysis of ACA. In the presence of nitrate, both hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) and reactive nitrogen species were generated, where center dot OH was the dominant reactive species that contributed to the degradation of ACA. Ten possible by-products ranging from single to multiple hydroxyl, nitroso, nitro and carbonyl substituted products were proposed to be produced from the nitrate-induced photodegradation process through three different pathways. This study demonstrated that the photolysis of NAs in OSPW due to the presence of natural photosensitizers and nitrate could act as a natural photosensitizer for the remediation of OSPW by the photo-oxidation process.

AB The newly emerged microplasma UV radiating technology can be a viable alternative to conventional radiation sources for UV water treatment. The capability of the microplasma UV lamp to mono-chromatically irradiate various wavelengths with different pulsation frequencies in a flat form opens new pathways for the development of novel UV-based water purifiers. This study is the first to systematically examine the microplasma UV lamp and develop a robust experimental method and apparatus for its operation to study the kinetics of both microbial and chemical pollutant degradation. The microplasma UV lamp was characterized in terms of its radiation profile and the impact of operating parameters on the lamp radiant power output. It was shown to be an instant-on and fast stabilized source. The radiant power output was a linear function of the electrical current and was not influenced by the lamp operating temperature and intermittent on/off cycles. A protocol was developed for obtaining reliable kinetic data for UV-induced elimination of microorganisms and micropollutants. An experimental setup was proposed for the kinetic studies, where the characteristics of the incident irradiance of the lamp, including uniformity, collimation, and divergence, were quantitatively evaluated. In addition, the water factor (WF) for calculating the average fluence rate was redefined for both the transient and steady state conditions. This modification is essential to account for changes in the UV transmittance of the medium, which could be an important factor for kinetic study of chemical contaminants. Two studied cases of microbial direct inactivation and the chemical photo-initiated oxidation process in different setups, based on the developed protocol, confirmed the reproducibility of the fluence-based kinetic data independent of the reactor size. The proposed protocol can be applied to the kinetic study of the elimination of microbial and chemical contaminants using microplasma UV lamps of any size, power, and peak wavelength.

AB The production of biologically stable drinking water is challenging in conventional surface water treatment plants. However, attainment of biological stability is essential to avoid regrowth in disinfectant-free distribution systems. A novel application of ultrafiltration as a posttreatment step to enhance biological stability of drinking water produced in an existing conventional surface water treatment plant was investigated. The conventional full-scale plant comprised coagulation/sedimentation/filtration, UV-disinfection, biological activated carbon filtration and chlorine dioxide post-disinfection. The produced water exhibited substantial regrowth of Aeromonads, invertebrates and colony counts in the distribution network. Recent literature attributes this phenomenon to the specific presence of slowly biodegradable, high molecular weight (MW) biopolymeric organic compounds. Hence, the aim of this study is to enhance the biological stability of conventionally treated surface water by reducing the concentration of high-MW organic compounds. For this purpose, biological active carbon filtrate was subjected to ultrafiltration with membrane pore sizes of 10 kDa, 150 kDa and 0.12 mu m respectively, operating in parallel. The UF performance was evaluated in terms of the achieved reduction in particulate and high-MW organic carbon (PHMOC); the biopolymer fraction in Liquid Chromatography-Organic Carbon Detection; biomass (cells, ATP); Assimilable Organic Carbon (AOC) by the AOC-P17/NOX method for easily biodegradable, low-MW compounds and by the AOC-A3 method for slowly biodegradable, high-MW compounds; and overall microbial growth potential (MGP) as assessed by Biomass Production Potential (BPP) and Bacterial Growth Potential (BGP) bio-assays. Results showed increasing removal of high-MW organic carbon with decreasing UF pore size, i.e., 30%, 60% and 70% removal was observed for the 0.12 mu m, 150 kDa and 10 kDa membranes, respectively. Biomass and particulates retention was more than 95% for all UF membranes. AOC-A3, BPP and BGP were substantially reduced by 90%, 70% and 50%, respectively. These respective reductions were similar for all three UF membranes despite their difference in pore size. Easily biodegradable organic compounds (as AOC-P17/NOX) were not reduced by any of the membranes, which was in accordance with expectations considering the low MW of the compounds involved. Based on the obtained results, growth potential appears to be largely attributable to high-MW organic compounds which are retained by a 0.12 mu m UF membrane. Furthermore, the quality of all three UF permeates was equal to or better than in reference cases (literature data) which exhibit little regrowth in their disinfectant-free distribution networks. The results demonstrate that ultrafiltration posttreatment in conventional surface water treatment plants is a potentially promising approach to enhance the biological stability of drinking water.

AB Constructed wetlands coupled with a micro-electric field (CW-MEF) is a novel and efficient water treatment technology. The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism and performance of trace metals (TMs) removal for CW-MEF systems during summer and winter. The mass distribution of TMs in plants and biofilms, physiological indices of wetland plants, and bacterial community structures on electrodes and in the rhizospheres were analyzed as well as to explore further the TM removal mechanism. Results show that the electric field intensities (EFI) of 100 and 200 mV cm(-1) had a significantly promoting effect on TM removal. Maximum removal efficiencies for Cu, Zn, Cd, Co, Ni and Pb were 95.6, 80.1, 74.0, 67.1, 69.8 and 99.6%, respectively, in summer with a 5d-hydraulic retention time (HRT). An EFI of 100 mV cm(-1) could alleviate the oxidative damage in plant cells by promoting the synthesis of reduced glutathione and an activity increase of catalase, thus increasing the phytoextraction for Cu, Zn and Cd. For biofilms, the MEF caused shifts in the bacterial community structures, and an EFI of 50 to 200 my cm(-1) significantly promoted the enrichment of Cu, Zn, Cd and Co by biofilms. Moreover, microorganisms related to TM tolerance and enrichment exhibited a high abundance with an EFI of 100 and 200 mV cm(-1). It can be concluded that introducing MEF to CWs could intensify the TMs removal via the biological process and result in more efficient purification for TM-containing wastewater.

AB Free DNA in the effluent from wastewater treatment plants has recently been observed to contain antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which may contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance via horizontal gene transfer in the receiving environment. Technical membrane systems applied in wastewater and drinking water treatment are situated at central nodes between the environmental and human related aspects of the "One Health" approach and are considered as effective barriers for antibiotic resistant bacteria. However, they are not evaluated for their permeability for ARGs encoded in free DNA, which may result, for example, from the release of free DNA after bacterial die-off during particular treatment processes. This study examined the potential and principle mechanisms for the removal of free DNA containing ARGs by technical membrane filtration. Ten different membranes, varied by the charge (neutral and negative) and the molecular weight cut off (in a range from microfiltration to reverse osmosis), were tested for the removal of free DNA (pure supercoiled and linearized plasmids encoding for ARGs and free linear chromosomal DNA with a broader fragment size spectrum) in different water matrices (distilled water and wastewater treatment plant effluent). Our results showed that membranes with a molecular weight cut off smaller than 5000 Da (ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and reverse osmosis) could retain >= 99.80% of free DNA, both pure plasmid and linear fragments of different sizes, whereas microfiltration commonly applied in wastewater treatment showed no retention. Size exclusion was identified as the main retention mechanism. Additionally, surface charging of the membrane and adsorption of free DNA on the membrane surface played a key role in prevention of free DNA permeation. Currently, majority of the applied membranes is negatively charged to prevent adsorption of natural organic matter. In our study, negatively charged membranes showed lower retention of free DNA compared to neutral ones due to repulsion of free DNA molecules, reduced adsorption and decreased blockage of the membrane surface. Therefore, the applied membrane may not be as an effective barrier for ARGs encoded in free DNA, as it would be predicted based only on the molecular weight cut off. Thus, careful considerations of membrane's specifications (molecular weight cut-off and charge) are required during design of a filtration system for retention of free DNA. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Treatment of persistent perfluorocarboxylic acids in water matrixes requires of strong oxidation conditions, as those achieved by boron doped diamond (BDD) electrooxidation (ELOX). However, large scale implementation of ELOX is still hindered by its high energy consumption and economical investment. In this work, we used process systems engineering tools to define the optimal integration of a membrane pre-concentration stage followed by the BDD electrolysis of the concentrate, to drastically reduce the costs of treatment of perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA, 100 mg L-1) in industrial waste streams. A multistage membrane cascade system using nanofiltration (NF90 and NF270 membranes) was considered to achieve more sophisticated PFHxA separations. The aim was to minimize the total costs by determining the optimal sizing of the two integrated processes (membrane area per stage and anode area) and the optimal process variables (pre-concentration operating time, electrolysis time, input and output concentrations). The non-linear programming model (NLP) was implemented in the General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS). The results showed that for a 2-log PFHxA abatement (99% removal), the optimal two membrane stages using the NF90 membrane obtains a 75.8% (6.4 $ m(-3)) reduction of the total costs, compared to the ELOX alone scenario (26.5 $ m(-3)). The optimized anode area and the energy savings, that were 85.3% and 88.2% lower than in ELOX alone, were the major contributions to the costs reduction. Similar results were achieved for a 3-log and 4-log PFHxA abatement, pointing out the promising benefits of integrating electrochemical oxidation with membrane pre-concentration through proper optimization for its large-scale application to waters impacted by perfluorocarboxylic acids.

AB Microplastics (MPs) are emerging pollutants that have been extensively detected in marine and terrestrial environments. Landfills are receptacles for cumulative loading of plastic waste derived from industry and households, but data on MPs occurrences in landfill systems are lacking. In the current study, the occurrence, characteristics and distribution patterns of MPs in landfills (including leachate and refuse) of the megacity Shanghai were investigated in accordance with different landfill ages (3-20 years). The results revealed that the average abundances of MPs in leachate and refuse were 8 (+/- 3) items/L and 62 (+/- 23) items/g, respectively. The predominant shapes and polymer types of the detected MPs were fibers and cellophane in leachate, whereas they were fragments and polyethylene in refuse. The patterns of abundance and size distribution of MPs in refuse varied from different landfill age, and different polymer MPs exhibited various occurrence patterns with increasing landfill age. Further spectra analysis suggested the presence of oxidative degradation of polyethylene MPs in the landfill process, especially for the landfill time of more than 20 years, so the fates of MPs in landfills were determined by the increase consumptions of plastics products and the degradation process of MPs in landfills. This study firstly provided a systematic overview of MPs pollution characteristics in landfill systems, and the results will foster the understanding of MPs fates over a long time scale in the environments.

AB Emerging contaminants (ECs) are primarily synthetic organic chemicals that have a focus of increasing attention due to either increased awareness of their potential risks to humans and aquatic biota, or only recently been detected in the aquatic environment or drinking water supplies, through improved analytical techniques.. Many ECs have no regulatory standards due to the lack of information on the effects of chronic exposure. Pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides and flame retardants are some of the most frequently detected ECs in aquatic environments, with over 200 individual compounds identified, to date. Current wastewater treatment is ineffective at removing ECs and there is a vital need for the development of efficient, cost-effective EC treatment systems that can be applied to a range of scales and wastewater types.
   Microalgae have demonstrated potential for detoxifying organic and inorganic pollutants, with a number of large-scale wastewater treatment microalgal technologies already developed. There are three main pathways that microalgae can bioremediate ECs; bioadsorption, bio-uptake and biodegradation. Microalgal bioadsorption occurs when ECs are either adsorbed to cell wall components, or onto organic substances excreted by the cells, while bio-uptake involves the active transport of the contaminant into the cell, where it binds to intracellular proteins and other compounds. Microalgal biodegradation of ECs involves the transformation of complex compounds into simpler breakdown molecules through catalytic metabolic degradation. Biodegradation provides one of the most promising technologies for the remediation of contaminants of concern as it can transform the contaminant to less toxic compounds rather than act as a biofilter. Further research is needed to exploit microalgal species for EC bioremediation properties, such as increased bioadsorption, enhanced biodegrading enzymes and optimised growth conditions. When coupled with nutrient removal, microalgal treatment of EC can be a cost-effective viable option for the reduction of contaminant pollution in waterways.

AB The ubiquitous algogenic extracellular organic matters (EOMs) could enhance solar photodegradation of antibiotics such as Chlortetracycline (CTC), however, the role of chemical constituents and structure in their photosensitizing process was not clear. In this paper, EOMs were extracted from chlorella vulgaris (CV-EOM5), scenedesmus meyen (SM-EOMs) and microcystis aeruginosa (MA-EOMs) to explore their photosensitive efficiencies and mechanisms. All of the EOMs showed higher photosensitive efficiencies than natural organic matter (NOM). The quenching assays and competitive kinetics experiments confirmed the dominant role of (EOMs)-E-3* in accelerating CTC photodegradation. The quantum yield coefficients of (EOMs)-E-3* (f(TMP)) of CV-EOM5, SM-EOMs, MA-EOMs, NOM were 139.89 +/- 5.46, 125.35 +/- 4.69, 91.76 +/- 3.53, and 72.84 +/- 4.45 L/(mol-photon), respectively. Specific chemical constituents and structure of EOM5 were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-CIR-MS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed the positive linear correlation of f(TMP) with content of carbonyl groups in EOMs. In addition, reduction of carbonyl groups in EOMs by NaBH4 significantly decreased CTC photodegradation rate. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation suggested the susceptible excitation of carbonyl groups in EOMs under solar light was ascribed to the lowest required energy of electronic transition from HOMO to LUMO (assigned as n-pi* transition). The energy of triplet excited-states benzophenone, p-methoxy acetophenone and acetophenone (the EOMs model compounds) was calculated to be 284.92, 288.85 and 265.50 kJ/mol, which were higher than that of CTC (i.e., 217.46 kJ/mol), indicating the energy transfer from excited triplet state to excited triplet state at was possible. This study provided mechanism insights into photosensitization effects of allogenic EOMs on photochemical fate of pollutants in aqueous environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing studies indicate that magnetite addition could accelerate the methanogenesis via enhancing direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET)-based anaerobic syntrophy. However, magnetite is found to run off in continuous bioreactor, and the effect of magnetite loss on syntrophic aggregates is still underreported. In this study, two EGSB reactors (RM with magnetite-enhanced sludge, and RB as a control) were operated to investigate the magnetite behavior in continuous bioreactor and the corresponding response of syntrophic aggregates. Results showed that magnetite in RM was washed out gradually in form of iron ions, and a slightly acidic niche was supposed to be the major cause. Nevertheless, candidate DIET partners like Geobacter and Methanothrix along with syntrophic volatile fatty acids (VFAs)-degrading microbes were enriched in RM. In addition, the improved redox activity of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), higher sludge conductivity and electron transport activity suggested that the DIET ability of sludge in RM was still enhanced, which favors the syntrophic metabolism of VFAs. Interestingly, syntrophic partners were loosely combined under the condition of high organic loading rate (OLR) in the presence of magnetite, but with gradual loss of magnetite, dense and active anaerobic granular sludge (AGS) was formed in RM. This study provided a comprehensive understanding of magnetite behavior in continuous bioreactor and the response of syntrophic aggregates. The robust DIET-based syntrophy after magnetite adding could favor the high-efficient anaerobic wastewater treatment and resource recovery in the future, and further investigations on magnetite resupply and the mechanism of magnetite enriching candidate DIET partners are recommended.

AB Recent investigations verified that calcium peroxide (CaO2) could be used to pretreat waste activated sludge to promote methane yield from anaerobic digestion. However, the underlying mechanism of how CaO2 pretreatment promotes methane production is unclear. This work therefore aims to provide insights into such systems. Experimental results showed that with an increase of CaO2 dosage from 0 to 0.14 gig VSS (volatile suspended solids) the methane yield increased linearly from 146.3 to 215.9 mL/g VSS. Further increases of CaO2 resulted in decreases in methane yield. CaO2 pretreatment promoted the disintegration of sludge and the degradation of sludge recalcitrant organics (especially humus and lignocellulose), thereby providing more substrates for subsequent methane production. Ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy indicated that CaO2 enhanced the cleavage of unsaturated conjugated bonds and reduced the aromaticity of humus and lignocellulose. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that CaO2 changed the structures and functional groups of humus and lignocellulose, making them transform to be biodegradable. GC/MS analyses exhibited that the degradation products of humus and lignocellulose included several types of small molecular organics such as ester-like, acid-like, and alcohol-like substances. Further investigation demonstrated that substantial methane could be produced from these degradation products. It was also found that the presence of recalcitrant organics was detrimental to anaerobes relevant to anaerobic digestion, and the degradation of such recalcitrant organics mitigated their inhibitions to the anaerobes. Model-based analysis suggested that CaO2 pretreatment increased the maximum methane yield and methane production rate, which were consistent with the analysis above. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Limited understanding of wastewater streams produced from shale oil and gas wells impedes best practices of wastewater treatment and reuse. This study provides a comprehensive and comparative analysis of flowback and produced water from three major and newly developed shale plays (the Bakken shale, North Dakota; the Barnett shale, Texas; and the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basin, Colorado) in central and western United States. Geochemical features that included more than 10 water quality parameters, dissolved organic matter, as well as microbial community structures were characterized and compared. Results showed that wastewater from Bakken and Barnett shales has extremely high salinity (similar to 295 g/L total dissolved solids (TDS)) and low organic concentration (80-252 mg/L dissolved organic carbon (DOC)). In contrast, DJ basin showed an opposite trend with low TDS (similar to 30 g/L) and high organic content (644 mg/L DOC). Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectra demonstrated that more humic acid and fluvic acid-like organics with higher aromaticity existed in Bakken wastewater than that in Barnett and DJ basin. Microbial communities of Bakken samples were dominated by Fe (III)-reducing bacteria Geobacter, lactic acid bacteria Lactococcus and Enterococcus, and Bradyrhizobium, while DJ basin water showed higher abundance of Rhodococcus, Thermovirga, and sulfate reducing bacteria Thermotoga and Petrotoga. All these bacteria are capable of hydrocarbon degradation. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens dominated the archaeal communities in all samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Iron chelators are often used to improve the performance of Fe(II) activated peroxides (e.g., peroxydisulfate (PDS) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)) for oxidative water treatment over a wide pH range due to the enhanced solubility of iron in the presence of chelators at high pH. In this study, we compared the effect of various chelators on the production and nature of the reactive intermediate formed in Fe(II)/PDS and Fe(II)/H2O2 systems by using methyl phenyl sulfoxide (PMSO) as a probe, which could distinguish ferryl ion (Fe(IV)) from free radicals ((OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot-) due to their marked difference in product formation. Six representative chelators (oxalate acid (OA), citric acid (CA), nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), ethyl-enediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), pyrophosphate (PPP), and tetrapolyphosphate (TPP)) which covered the commonly used polycarboxylates, aminocarboxylates, and polyphosphates ligands were selected. In chelator assisted Fe(II)/PDS systems, the highest PMSO transformation efficiency at pH 3-9 was obtained in cases with polycarboxylates, due to their higher reactivity to PDS activation, lower steric hindrance, and stronger ability in promoting Fe(II)/Fe(III) cycle. Comparatively, in chelator assisted Fe(11)/H2O2 systems, TPP addition achieved the best performance in PMSO transformation at pH > 5. Moreover, the yield of Fe(IV) indicative product (methyl phenyl sulfone, PMSO2) decreased with increasing chelator/Fe(II) molar ratio, but was independent on pH in cases of PDS, indicating that chelator altered reactive intermediate nature from Fe(IV) to SO4 center dot- and Fe(IV) yield was not sensitive to pH. In cases of H2O2, chelator decreased PMSO2 production while promoting PMSO loss at near-neutral pH, suggesting that Fe(II)-chelator complexes also tended to catalyze H2O2 to generate (OH)-O-center dot rather than Fe(IV).

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of natural organic matter (NOM) including humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA), intracellular organic matter (IOM) extracted from Microcystis aeruginosa (MA) and Chlorella sp. (CH), and their different molecular weight (MW) fractions on the aerobic denitrification performance of bacterial strain WGX-9 by monitoring nitrogen removal efficiency and testing changes in organic matter with HA, FA, MA-IOM and CH-IOM as the sole carbon source. Strain WGX-9 was identified as Acinetobacter johnsonii and exhibited excellent aerobic denitrification capability. The nitrate removal efficiency with IOM as the sole carbon source was relatively higher than that with NOM as the sole carbon source. The prepared NOM and extracted IOM samples were separated into six fractions with MW cut-offs of 100, 30, 10, 5 and 1 kDa. The fraction of MW > 100 kDa contributed the largest amount to the MW distribution, accounting for 77.11%, 29.00%, 44.97% and 24.81% of HA, FA, MA-IOM, and CH-IOM, respectively. Nitrate removal efficiency was improved with decreasing MW of organic matter. For example, nitrate removal efficiency was 26.50%, 32.41%, 27.88% and 43.89% using HA, FA, MA-IOM, and CH-IOM fractions of MW > 100 kDa as the carbon source, whereas with MW < 1 kDa, it increased to 36.67%, 37.88%, 60.90%, and 68.90%, respectively. This is probably because the smaller MW fraction is more suitable for bacterial growth. These results demonstrate that the strain WGX-9 can utilize lower MW organic matter, which lays the foundations for nitrogen removal in actual drinking water reservoirs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The high pollutant loads discharged from cities pose risks to urban waterways, and in turn the estuarine environments, making it challenging to improve urban liveability. Past studies on the behaviour of pollutants in rivers have largely investigated their transport along the waterway, primarily focusing on the movement of water and sediment. However, the current approaches in pollutant transport modelling provide limited insights into how pollutant transfer between water and sediment phases influences their transport from the upstream towards the estuarine environment. This research study firstly identified typical patterns of metal loads along an urban river in a highly populated city in China. The outcomes were then used to conceptualise metal transfer between water and sediment phases. It was noted that physico-chemical characteristics of water and sediments play a key role in metal transfer between the two phases, and the dominant transfer path (sediment to water/water to sediment) is different between different metals, independent of their origin (crustal, anthropogenic or marine-related). Several scenarios were derived from the conceptualisation of metal behaviour. These in turn were then used to develop real-world scenarios of metal transport in rivers based on the field data. The conceptualisation of metal behaviour confirmed that each metal is likely to have a dominant phase of transport (sediment/water), which is influenced by the dominant transfer path of that metal between water and sediments.

AB Controlling membrane fouling is challenging and information regarding the causes of fouling is critical for this. While liquid-phase fluorescence spectroscopy excitation emission matrix (LPF-EEM) has previously been applied to identify the characteristics of membrane foulants, we applied EEM measurements to solid samples to identify foulants accumulated on the membrane. This solid-phase fluorescence EEM (SPF-EEM) enables sensitive and nondestructive identification of different organic solids. LPF-EEMs and SPF-EEMs were used on natural organic matter (NOM) isolated from secondary-treated wastewater, which revealed differences in peak positions and in spectral shapes. SPF-EEMs and LPF-EEMs of hydrophobic (HPO), transphilic (TPI) and hydrophilic (HPI) fractions showed that peaks of HPO fraction disappeared while those of TPI and HPI fractions shifted to a longer excitation and emission position through solidification. Then, the surface of the membrane fiber was continuously monitored using SPF-EEM during filtration. Three peaks appeared as expected during membrane fouling progression, indicating that in-situ monitoring of foulants was successful. Comparison of the EEM peaks between foulants and isolated NOM fractions shows the presence of both liquid-phase proteinaceous substances and gels formed from HPI and TPI fractions. Changes in peak intensity confirmed that the former proteinaceous substances were responsible for both reversible and irreversible fouling, while the latter gels mainly contributed to the irreversible fouling. We demonstrated the functionality of the SPF-EEM as an in-situ fouling monitoring tool. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study employed a titanium mesh-membrane assembly (MMA) as the current collector in flow electrode capacitive deionization (FCDI) device (designated as M-FCDI), and obtained a much reduced charge transport distance as compared to traditional FCDI with plate-shaped current collectors located far from the exchange membrane. The average salt removal rate of M-FCDI was greatly improved by 76% under 10 wt% carbon content than the control experiment with graphite plate as current collector, and the charge efficiency remained over 75% even under low carbon loading. This improvement was attributed to the reduced resistance as revealed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests. Further investigation on FCDI's performance with different specifications of titanium meshes showed that the implementation of MMA could provide a larger effective electron transfer area, which would lead to better desalting performance.

AB Photosynthetic microbial fuel cells (PMFCs) allow renewable energy production from wastewater. However, system scale-up is still a major challenge hindering the use of PMFCs for practical applications. Herein, a PMFC stack, which consisted of multiple anodic chambers installed in an algal raceway pond (ARP), was established to recovery energy from anaerobically digested effluent with the assistance of a prototypical capacitor circuit. The highest voltage output of the stack reached 1.4 V with four PMFC units and four capacitors. The system can produce stable voltages through controlling charging and discharging frequencies and the voltage output remained stable around 0.60 V when the time interval decreased to 2 s. During long-term operation, the highest power density of the stack with capacitors reached 2.34 W/m(3), which was 77% higher than that without capacitors (1.32 W/m(3)). About 98% of the ammonium in the anolyte was removed, resulting from the ammonium migration effect. The dynamics of bacterial community compositions were not greatly influenced by the capacitor circuit, and the stack with capacitors had a more stable bacterial community compared to the stack without capacitors. The variations in bacterial community composition following power density changes indicated that members of the Clostridia and Betaproteobacteria were related to power generation. Bacteria affiliated to Bacteroidetes were inhibited when power density was high, though their numbers were enriched at the end of the process. This study promotes a practical method for developing the PMFC technology into real-world applications, and furthermore reveals the main bacteria that play vital roles in power generation by analysing the anodic bacterial community during the whole process.

AB Ultrasonic humidifier use is a potential source of human exposure to inhalable particulates. This research evaluated the behavior of insoluble iron oxide and aluminum oxide particles in water used to fill room sized ultrasonic humidifiers. Solutions of 10 mg/L Fe, as iron oxide particles, or 5 mg/L Al, as aluminum oxide suspension, were added into tap water used to fill ultrasonic humidifiers. The humidifiers were operated for 14 h; samples were obtained over time and monitored for soluble and particulate Fe and Al, as well as particle sizes in the humidifier reservoir and emitted in aerosols. Denser, settleable particles of approximately 1.5 mu m diameter of iron or aluminum oxides accumulated at the bottom of the humidifier reservoir. Smaller, suspended metal oxide particles of 0.22-0.57 mu m diameter were emitted as aerosols from the humidifier. Soluble anions and cations in tap water were also present in the aerosols emitted from humidifiers. The results indicate that a typical 1.6 MHz ultrasonic humidifier can emit 0.22-0.57 mu m particles and dissolved minerals from fill water into breathable air. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Understanding microbial community structure and function within the subsurface is critical to assessing overall quality and maintenance of groundwater; however, the factors that determine microbial community assembly, structure, and function in groundwater systems and their impact on water quality remains poorly understood. In this study, three shallow wells (FW301, FW303, FW305) in a non contaminated shallow aquifer in the ENIGMA-Oak Ridge Field Research Center (Oak Ridge, TN) were sampled approximately 3 times a week over a period of three months to measure changes in groundwater geochemistry and microbial diversity. It was expected that the sampled microbial diversity from two historic field wells (FW301, FW303) would be relatively stable, while diversity from a newer well (FW305) would be less stable over time. The wells displayed some degree of hydrochemical variability over time unique to each well, with FW303 being overall the most stable well and FW301 being the most dynamic based upon dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and nitrate. Community analysis via ss-rRNA paired-end sequencing and distribution-based clustering revealed higher OTU richness, diversity, and variability in groundwater communities of FW301 than the other two wells for diversity binned over all time points. Microbial community composition of a given well was on average > 50% dissimilar to any other well at a given time (days), yet, functional gene diversity as measured with GeoChip remained relatively constant. Similarities in community structure across wells were observed with respect to the presence of 20 shared bacterial groups in all samples in all wells, although at varying levels over the tested time period. Similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis revealed that variability in FW301 was largely attributed to low abundance, highly-transient populations, while variability in the most hydro chemically stable well (FW303) was due to fluctuations in more highly abundant and frequently present taxa. Additionally, the youngest well FW305 showed a dramatic shift in community composition towards the end of the sampling period that was not observed in the other wells, suggesting possible succession events over time. Time-series analysis using vector auto-regressive models and Granger causality showed unique relationships between richness and geochemistry over time in each well. These results indicate temporally dynamic microbial communities over short time scales, with day-to-day population shifts in local community structure influenced by available source community diversity and local groundwater hydrochemistry.

AB The activated sludge (AS) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) sludge systems were continuously operated for 200 days in laboratory to investigate the stress-responses of these two sludge systems under ciprofloxacin (CIP) exposure. It was found that CIP was effectively removed by SRB sludge via adsorption and biodegradation, but little biodegradation in AS system. The CIP biodegradation by SRB sludge made the SRB sludge system more sustainable and tolerant to long-term CIP exposure than AS system with significant (p <0.05) CIP desorption and decrease of CIP removal. CIP shaped the microbial communities in AS and SRB sludge, and significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited the family Nitrosomonadaceae (ammonia oxidizing bacteria (A0B)) and genus Nitrospira (nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB)/complete ammonia oxidizer(comammox)) and the nitrogen removal in AS system. Moreover, CIP posed the increase of genus Zoogloea-like organisms and the non-filamentous bulking of AS, e.g. 313 +/- 12 mL/g of sludge volume index (SVI) at phase V (influent CIP = 5000 mu g/L). The genus Desulfobacter was enriched in SRB sludge system under long-term CIP exposure, and stimulated chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and sulfate reduction. The increase of genera Zoogloea, Acinetobacter and Flavobacterium in AS, and Zoogloea and Acinetobacter in SRB sludge systems under CIP exposure promoted extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production and CIP adsorption for self-protection of microbes against CIP toxicity. The functional groups of N-H, O-H, C-O-C and C=O in EPS of AS and SRB sludge provided adsorption sites for CIP and impeded CIP impact on microbial cells. The findings of this study provide an insight into the stress-responses of AS and SRB sludge under long-term CIP exposure, and exhibit the great potential of treating CIP-laden wastewater by SRB sludge system.

AB Stringent regulations and deteriorating source water quality could greatly influence the water production capacity of drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs). Using models to predict the performance of DWTPs under stress provides valuable information for decision making and future planning. A hybrid statistic model named HANN was established by combining artificial neural network (ANN) with genetic algorithm (GA) aiming at forecasting the overall performance of DWTPs nationwide in China. Monthly data from 45 DWTPs across China was employed. Water quality parameters like temperature and chemical oxygen demand (COD) and operational parameters like electricity consumption and chemical consumption were selected as input variables, while drinking water production was employed as the output. Both preliminary data analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) suggested a clear nonlinear relationship between the input and output variables. The structure of the HANN model was optimized by employing the lowest mean squared error (MSE) as the indicator. The resultant HANN model performed well when simulating the training datasets. Its predictive accuracy for the independent test datasets was enhanced when feeding more training datasets and the performance was constantly higher than the independent multi-layered ANN models using the coefficient of determination (R-2) as the indicator, indicating the HANN model was capable of capturing complex non-linear relationship and extrapolation. Results from Accuracy test, Garson sensitivity analysis and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) suggested the quantity of water produced by DWTPs was closely linked to water quality and operational parameters. The scenario analysis showed that the HANN model was capable of predicting water production variation based on the parameter variations, indicating that the HANN model could be a general management tool for decision makers and DWTP managers to make plans in advance of regulatory changes, source water quality variations and market demand.

AB Advanced oxidation using UV/free chlorine and UV/chloramines are being considered as alternatives to UV/H2O2 for treatment of reverse osmosis (RO) permeate in treatment trains for the potable reuse of municipal wastewater. This pilot-scale comparison of the three advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) evaluated three factors important for selecting among these alternatives. First, the study characterized the speciation of oxidants serving as the source of radicals within the AOPs to facilitate process modeling. Kinetic modeling that included consideration of the chloramines occurring in RO permeate accurately predicted oxidant speciation. Modeling of the UV/free chlorine AOP indicated that free chlorine is scavenged by reactions with ammonia and monochloramine in RO permeate, such that oxidant speciation can shift in favor of dichloramine over the short (similar to 30 s) timescale of AOP treatment. Second, the order of efficacy for degrading the target contaminant, 1,4-dioxane, in terms of minimizing UV fluence was UV/free chlorine > UV/H2O2 >> UV/chloramines. However, estimates indicated that the UV/chloramines and UV/H2O2 AOPs could be similar on a cost-effectiveness basis due to savings in reagent costs by the UV/chloramines AOP, provided the RO permeate featured >3 mg/L as Cl-2 chloramines. Third, the study evaluated whether the use of chlorine-based oxidants within the UV/free chlorine and UV/chloramines AOPs enhanced disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation. Even after AOP treatment and chloramination, total halogenated DBP formation remained low at <15 mu g/L for all three AOPs. DBP formation was similar between the AOPs, except that the UV/free chlorine AOP promoted haloacetaldehyde formation, while the UV/H2O2 and UV/chloramines AOPs followed by chloramination increased chloropicrin formation. However, total DBP formation on a toxic potency-weighted basis was similar among the AOPs, since haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides were the dominant contributors and did not differ significantly among the AOPs.

AB As freshwater sources continue to be influenced by wastewater effluents, there is a dire need to develop advanced water treatment processes capable of treating the wastewater-derived contaminants, especially for pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs). Ultraviolet light (UV) combined with calcium peroxide (CaO2) as an advanced oxidation process (AOP) to attenuate five widespread PhACs (carbamazepine (CBZ), primidone (PMD), phenobarbital (PBB), thiamphenicol (TAP) and florfenicol (FF)) was investigated in this paper. The degradation of these compounds followed pseudo-first-order kinetics (R-2>0.96). The optimum CaO2 dosage was 0.1 g L-1 and lower initial contaminants concentration was beneficial to their degradation. The UV/CaO2 treatment of test PhACs was attributed to the combination of UV/H2O2 and UV-base-photolysis (UV/Ca(OH)(2)), and the degradation mechanism was recognized as both UV direct photolysis and indirect photolysis caused by reactive radicals (center dot OH, triplet states of dissolved organic matter ((DOM)-D-3*), and O-1(2)). Furthermore, the tentative transformation pathways of the five PhACs were proposed based on the detected intermediates and the degradation mechanisms. The final products of inorganic carbon and nitrogen indicate UV/CaO2 treatment can significantly mineralize test PhACs. Also, the CaO2 addition significantly reduced the energy consumption of UV irradiation according to electrical energy per order. The effective removal of CBZ and PMD in a secondary wastewater effluent by UV/CaO2 treatment demonstrates the potential use of this AOP technology in advanced treatment of wastewater-derived PhACs.

AB A novel full-scale prefix oxic coking wastewater (CWW) biological treatment O/H/O system had been operated steadily six years with the effluent quality meeting national discharge standard. Comparing to the traditional CWW biological treatment process, which usually have an anaerobic unit at the start of the process, here the O/H/O system has obvious advantages in COD removal, total nitrogen removal and reduced energy consumption. It is very necessary to illustrate the structure and function of the microbial community involved in different bioreactors of the O/H/O system. High-throughput MiSeq sequencing was used to examine the 16S rRNA genes in this system. Results revealed a contrasting microbial composition among the activated sludge samples of three sequential bioreactors: the beta-Proteobacteria related sequences dominated in the O-1 activated sludge with the relative abundance of 56.44% while 7.53% of the sequences were assigned to Thiobacillus; Rhodoplanes related sequences dominated in the bioreactor H and O-2 activated sludge with relative abundance of 8.86% and 8.92%, respectively. The physico-chemical characteristics of CWW were analyzed by standard methods and the operational parameters were routinely monitored to examine their effects on the microbial communities. The bioinformatics software package of phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) was used to predict the microbial community functional profiling and found three dominant genera of Rhodoplanes, Lysobacter and Leucobacter enriched the xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism pathway. The diverse and distinct microbial community involved in biological treatment processes of CWW treatment indicating that water characteristics and operational parameters determined the microbial community composition. These results significantly expanded our knowledge of the biodiversity and population dynamics of microorganisms and discerned the relationships between bacterial communities and environmental variables in the biological treatment processes. Moreover, in this study, we proposed a comprehensive biodegradation model of CWW treatment and defined as O/H/O system. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Confined nematic liquid crystals can admit multiple stable equilibria. These equilibrium states usually exhibit peculiar defect patterns in order to satisfy the topological constraints imposed by the boundary conditions. In this work, we systematically investigate transition pathways between different stable equilibria of nematic liquid crystals confined in a cylinder with homeotropic boundary condition. To do so, we implement spectral method to minimize the Landau-de Gennes free energy and develop a multiscale string method to accurately compute both minimal energy path and transition state. We first compute the transition pathways under the assumption that system state is invariant along the axial direction of the cylinder. This axial invariant assumption allows us to reduce the simulation domain to a two-dimensional disk. We subsequently remove the axial invariant assumption to search the transition pathways in the three-dimensional cylinder. Numerical simulations demonstrate that there exists a threshold for the cylinder height above which a domino-like transition pathway is more energetically favored than the axial invariant transition pathway. Moreover, we show that the transition pathway from escape radial with ring defects (ERRD) to escape radial has a lower energy barrier than the one from ERRD to planar polar, even though the free energy of the planar polar state is lower than that of the escape radial state. Our approach provides an accurate and efficient method to compute minimal energy path and transition state of confined nematic liquid crystals. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Inverse Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), or Bayesian calibration, is the process to quantify the uncertainties of random input parameters based on experimental data. The introduction of model discrepancy term is significant because "over-fitting" can theoretically be avoided. But it also poses challenges in the practical applications. One of the mostly concerned and unresolved problem is the "lack of identifiability" issue. With the presence of model discrepancy, inverse UQ becomes "non-identifiable" in the sense that it is difficult to precisely distinguish between the parameter uncertainties and model discrepancy when estimating the calibration parameters. Previous research to alleviate the non-identifiability issue focused on using informative priors for the calibration parameters and the model discrepancy, which is usually not a viable solution because one rarely has such accurate and informative prior knowledge. In this work, we show that identifiability is largely related to the sensitivity of the calibration parameters with regards to the chosen responses. We adopted an improved modular Bayesian approach for inverse UQ that does not require priors for the model discrepancy term. The relationship between sensitivity and identifiability was demonstrated with a practical example in nuclear engineering. It was shown that, in order for a certain calibration parameter to be statistically identifiable, it should be significant to at least one of the responses whose data are used for inverse UQ. Good identifiability cannot be achieved for a certain calibration parameter if it is not significant to any of the responses. It is also demonstrated that "fake identifiability" is possible if model responses are not appropriately chosen, or if inaccurate but informative prior distributions are specified.

AB We present a time-space flux-corrected transport (FCT) finite element formulation for the multi-dimensional time-dependent advection-diffusion-reaction equation. Monotonic solutions can be achieved with the presented method while large time steps (with Courant number C-r > 1) are used. Numerical verification, as well as a grid convergence analysis, are carried out for 1D and 2D benchmark problems. A 1D Burgers' equation with various Reynolds numbers is solved with the time-space FCT method. In addition, a 2D transport problem with (and without) a nonlinear reaction inside of a cavity is considered. Finally, the newly developed time-space FCT formulation is applied for modeling biofilm growth problems based on a continuum mathematical model. It turns out that the time-space FCT method helps to reduce numerical dissipation and guarantees comparable numerical dispersion of the solution at the same time comparing to numerical solutions obtained by a time-space finite incremental calculus (FIC) method.

AB We propose a high order numerical method for computing time dependent 4-D Wigner equation with unbounded potentials and study a canonical quantum double-slit interference problem. To address the difficulties of 4-D phase space computations and higher derivatives from the Moyal expansion of the nonlocal pseudo-differential operator for un-bounded potentials, an operator splitting technique is adopted to decompose the 4-D Wigner equation into two sub-equations, which can be computed either analytically or numerically with high efficiency. The first sub-equation contains only a linear convection term in (x, t)-space and can be solved with an upwinding characteristic method, while the second involves the pseudo-differential term and can be approximated by a plane wave expansion in k-space. By exploiting properties of Fourier transformations, the expansion coefficients for the second sub-equation have explicit forms and the resulting scheme is shown to be unconditionally stable for any high order derivatives in the Moyal expansion, ensuring the feasibility of 4-D Wigner numerical simulations for quantum double-slit interferences. Numerical experiments demonstrate the spectral convergence in (x, k)-space and provide highly accurate information on the number, position, and intensity of the interference fringes for different types of slits, quantum particle masses, and initial states (pure and mixed).

AB Efficient and accurate numerical schemes, based on the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach, are proposed to find the ground state solutions of one-and multi-component Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs). Two types of SAV schemes are proposed: the first is based on the original SAV scheme for the imaginary time gradient flow of BECs which is accurate for the dynamic evolution; the second is a modified SAV scheme based on the normalized imaginary time gradient flow and leads to fast convergence towards the steady state solutions. Detailed numerical comparison with existing methods based on projection to the constrained space indicates that the modified SAV schemes are more efficient, particularly for the multi-component BECs.

ID GODUNOV METHOD; FINITE DEFORMATION; HIGH-ORDER; SOLVER; MODEL
AB Two formulations of the Lax-Wendroff scheme are proposed in this paper for its extension to elastic-plastic solids. The unknown vector consists of the strain or stress components in addition to the velocity ones according to the chosen formulation. The Lax-Wendroff scheme is here implemented in its Richtmyer two-step version so that the projection of the elastic trial stresses onto the yield locus is performed twice per time step. It is shown that it allows to reduce the number of cells required for the approximation of discontinuous plastic waves with respect to a classical one-step strategy consisting in an a posteriori projection of the elastic trial stresses onto the yield locus. Elastic-plastic associated and non-associated constitutive models under small strains are considered in examples. In particular, dynamic ratchetting is simulated with the Armstrong-Frederick nonlinear kinematic hardening. Comparisons with respect to finite element numerical solutions show good agreements.

AB In this work we report on a reduced-order model (ROM) for the system of time-domain Maxwell's equations discretized by a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method. We leverage previous results on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) [1,2], in particular for the wave equation [3], to propose a POD-based ROM with an adaptive snapshot selection strategy where the snapshots are produced by a high order discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) solver. The latter is formulated on an unstructured simplicial mesh, and combines a centered scheme for the definition of the numerical fluxes of the electric and magnetic fields at element interfaces with a second order leap-frog (LF2) time scheme for the time integration of the associated semi-discrete equations. The POD-based ROM is established by projecting (Galerkin projection) the global semi-discrete DG scheme onto a low-dimensional space generated by the POD basis vectors. Inspired from the approach followed in [2,3], we derive error bounds for the POD-based ROM that is adapted to our particular modeling and discretization settings. The adaptive snapshot selection algorithm exploits the results of this analysis to measure the control error. A snapshot choosing rule aiming at keeping the error estimate close to a target selection error tolerance is proposed, which is similar to the standard rules found in adaptive time-stepping ordinary differential equations (ODEs) solvers. An incremental singular value decomposition (ISVD) algorithm is used to update the SVD on-the-fly when a new snapshot is available. The purpose of this adaptive selection strategy is to save memory without storing snapshots, while producing a smaller error. Numerical experiments for the 2-D time-domain Maxwell's equations nicely illustrate the performance of the resulting POD-based ROM with adaptive snapshot selection. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB The residual-driven iterative corrector scheme recently presented by the authors for linear problems has opened a pathway to achieve the best possible fine-mesh accuracy in the multiscale finite element method (MsFEM). In this article, we focus on a series of algorithmic and variational extensions that enable efficient residual-driven correction for nonlinear localization problems. These include a synergistic combination of Newton and corrector iterations to reduce the algorithmic complexity, the use of corrector degrees of freedom in the Galerkin projection to eliminate the repeated recomputation of multiscale basis functions during Newton iterations, and a natural residual-based strategy for fully automatic fine-mesh adaptivity. We illustrate through numerical examples from phase-field fracture and plasticity that the MsFEM with residual-driven adaptive correction achieves full fine-scale fidelity while also being computationally more efficient than the pristine MsFEM. We also show that for localization problems, it significantly increases accuracy and robustness over standard oversampling. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the present paper, a multi-step reconstruction procedure is proposed for high order finite volume schemes on unstructured grids using compact stencil. The procedure is a recursive algorithm that can eventually provide sufficient relations for high order reconstruction in a multi-step procedure. Two key elements of this procedure are the partial inversion technique and the continuation technique. The partial inversion can be used not only to obtain lower order reconstruction based on existing reconstruction relations, but also to regularize the existing reconstruction relations to provide new relations for higher order reconstructions. The continuation technique is to extend the regularized relations on the face-neighboring cells to current cell as additional reconstruction relations. This multi-step procedure is operationally compact since in each step only the relations defined on a compact stencil are used. In the present paper, the third and fourth order finite volume schemes based on two-step quadratic and three-step cubic reconstructions are studied. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE) and its variants are important implicit continuum models for predicting the electrostatics of solvated biomolecules. In this paper, in order to accurately predict the gradient of electrostatics, we propose a new flux-jump preserved gradient recovery method and then fulfill it in the program using Python and Fortran. Two numerical tests with available analytical solutions are presented to well validate the new program. Then the new proposed method is applied to recover the gradient of a simple dipole case as well as two protein cases using the numerical solutions of both PBE and SMPBE. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper, we present a high order finite difference solver for anisotropic diffusion problems based on the first-order hyperbolic system method. In particular, we demonstrate that the construction of a uniformly accurate fifth-order scheme that is independent of the degree of anisotropy is made straightforward by the hyperbolic method with an optimal length scale. We demonstrate that the gradients are computed simultaneously to the same order of accuracy as that of the solution variable by using weight compact finite difference schemes. Furthermore, the approach is extended to improve further the simulation of the magnetized electrons test case previously discussed in Refs. [47] and[24]. Numerical results indicate that these schemes are capable of delivering high accuracy and the proposed approach is expected to allow the hyperbolic method to be successfully applied to a wide variety of linear and nonlinear problems with anisotropic diffusion.

AB There are growing attentions to providing a simple and accurate shock detection method for computational fluid dynamics, not only for identifying the shocks in the post-processing but also for developing low-dissipation numerical schemes. However, most of conventional methods are designed for only either of them, as represented by Kanamori-Suzuki sensor [22] and Ducros sensor [1999]. The former method is quite accurate in inviscid flows but rather expensive to be incorporated into a numerical scheme, whereas the latter is very efficient and widely used while calling for an expert's care in determining actual shocks. In order to achieve both efficiency and theoretical accuracy, we developed a novel shock detection method for two-dimensional viscous/inviscid flows on Cartesian grids based on Canny-Edge-Detection [29], which is a well-known image processing method. We successfully applied the Canny-Edge-Detection to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solutions by replacing the brightness value of digital images with pressure in CFD solutions. Then, by taking advantages of the simplicity of Canny-Edge-Detection along with Rankine-Hugoniot conditions across shocks (where 50% deviation is intentionally allowed only within the numerically captured shock), our method is designed to be both efficient and theoretically accurate, in contrast with the conventional schemes. The detection results of our method are examined in selected three test cases, in comparison with the Kanamori-Suzuki sensor and the Ducros sensor. Through the tests, we confirmed that our sensor is as accurate as Kanamori-Suzuki method, while as cheap as the Ducros sensor. In addition, the present sensor successfully detects shocks even in a viscous flow, and smoothly represents shocks oblique to the grid lines. Therefore, our sensor is eventually expected to contribute not only to the post-processing in CFD but also to developing schemes for computing highspeed flows with low cost and high accuracy.

AB The coupling of the compressible and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is considered. Our ambition is to take a first step towards a provably well posed and stable coupling procedure. We study a simplified setting with a stationary planar interface and small disturbances from a steady background flow with zero velocity normal to the interface. The simplified setting motivates the use of the linearized equations, and we derive interface conditions such that the continuous problem satisfy an energy estimate. The interface conditions can be imposed both strongly and weakly. It is shown that the weak and strong interface imposition produce similar continuous energy estimates.
   We discretize the problem in time and space by employing finite difference operators that satisfy a summation-by-parts rule. The interface and initial conditions are imposed weakly using a penalty formulation. It is shown that the results obtained for the weak interface conditions in the continuous case, lead directly to stability of the fully discrete problem. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we consider an approximation method, and a novel general analysis, for second-order elliptic differential equations with heterogeneous multiscale coefficients. We obtain convergence of the Generalized Multi-scale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM) method that uses local eigenvectors in its construction. The analysis presented here can be extended, without great difficulty, to more sophisticated GMsFEMs. For concreteness, the obtained error estimates generalize and simplify the convergence analysis of Y. Efendiev et al. (2011) [22]. The GMsFEM method construct basis functions that are obtained by multiplication of (approximation of) local eigenvectors by partition of unity functions. Only important eigenvectors are used in the construction. The error estimates are general and are written in terms of the eigenvalues of the eigenvectors not used in the construction. The error analysis involve local and global norms that measure the decay of the expansion of the solution in terms of local eigenvectors. Numerical experiments are carried out to verify the feasibility of the approach with respect to the convergence and stability properties of the analysis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Overset meshes are an effective tool for the computational fluid dynamic simulation of problems with complex geometries or multiscale spatio-temporal features. When the maximum allowable timestep on one or more meshes is significantly smaller than on the remaining meshes, standard explicit time integrators impose inefficiencies for time-accurate calculations by requiring that all meshes advance with the smallest timestep. With the targeted use of multi-rate time integrators, separate meshes can be time-marched at independent rates to avoid wasteful computation while maintaining accuracy and stability. This work applies time-explicit multi-rate integrators to the simulation of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations discretized on overset meshes using summation-by-parts (SBP) operators and simultaneous approximation term (SAT) boundary conditions. We introduce a class of multi-rate Adams-Bashforth (MRAB) schemes that offer significant stability improvements and computational efficiencies for SBP-SAT methods. We present numerical results that confirm the efficacy of MRAB integrators, outline a number of implementation challenges, and demonstrate a reduction in computational cost enabled by MRAB. We also investigate the use of our method in the setting of a large-scale distributed-memory parallel implementation where we discuss concerns involving load balancing and communication efficiency.

AB Due to the rapid advancement of supercomputing resource, there is a growing interest in developing parallel algorithms for the large-scale reservoir simulation. In this paper, we present a parallel and fully implicit simulator for the black oil model based on the variational inequality (VI) framework, which can be used to enforce important mathematical and physical properties to obtain accurate constraint-preserving solutions. In other words, this framework ensures the predicted solution to stay within the physical range. In the proposed approach, the black oil model is reformulated as a variational inequality system that naturally satisfies the basic boundedness requirement of the solution, and then a fully implicit finite volume method is applied to discretize the model equations. In addition to that, a number of nonlinear and linear fast solver technologies, including a variant of inexact Newton methods and the domain decomposition based preconditioners, are employed to guarantee the robustness and parallel scalability of the simulator. A particular emphasis of the proposed framework is placed on the parallel and algorithmic performance of the variational inequality approach across large-scale and heterogeneous problems. Several numerical results pertaining to the problems in one, two and three dimensions are presented to illustrate the efficiency, robustness, and the overall performance of the fully implicit constraint-preserving simulator.

AB In Bayesian inverse problems sampling the posterior distribution is often a challenging task when the underlying models are computationally intensive. To this end, surrogates or reduced models are often used to accelerate the computation. However, in many practical problems, the parameter of interest can be of high dimensionality, which renders standard model reduction techniques infeasible. In this paper, we present an approach that employs the ANOVA decomposition method to reduce the model with respect to the unknown parameters, and the reduced basis method to reduce the model with respect to the physical parameters. Moreover, we provide an adaptive scheme within the MCMC iterations, to perform the ANOVA decomposition with respect to the posterior distribution. With numerical examples, we demonstrate that the proposed model reduction method can significantly reduce the computational cost of Bayesian inverse problems, without sacrificing much accuracy.

ID DISCONTINUOUS GALERKIN METHODS; ALGORITHMS; SCHEMES
AB In this paper, the numerical discretizations based on Hamiltonian splitting for solving the Vlasov-Maxwell system are constructed. We reformulate the Vlasov-Maxwell system in Morrison-Marsden-Weinstein Poisson bracket form. Then the Hamiltonian of this system is split into five parts, with which five corresponding Hamiltonian subsystems are obtained. The splitting method in time is derived by composing the solutions to these five subsystems. Combining the splitting method in time with the Fourier spectral method and finite volume method in space gives the full numerical discretizations which possess good conservation for the conserved quantities including energy, momentum, charge, etc. In numerical experiments, we simulate the Landau damping, Weibel instability and Bernstein wave to verify the numerical algorithms.

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS

DT Article

   Gradient Descent
AB In this work, a novel sequential Monte Carlo filter is introduced which aims at an efficient sampling of the state space. Particles are pushed forward from the prediction to the posterior density using a sequence of mappings that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the posterior and the sequence of intermediate densities. The sequence of mappings represents a gradient flow based on the principles of local optimal transport. A key ingredient of the mappings is that they are embedded in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which allows for a practical and efficient Monte Carlo algorithm. The kernel embedding provides a direct means to calculate the gradient of the Kullback-Leibler divergence leading to quick convergence using well-known gradient-based stochastic optimization algorithms. Evaluation of the method is conducted in the chaotic Lorenz-63 system, the Lorenz-96 system, which is a coarse prototype of atmospheric dynamics, and an epidemic model that describes cholera dynamics. No resampling is required in the mapping particle filter even for long recursive sequences. The number of effective particles remains close to the total number of particles in all the sequence. Hence, the mapping particle filter does not suffer from sample impoverishment. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB In the context of multibody dissipative particle dynamics (MDPD), a closed-form mathematical expression is developed to analytically model a complex wall. MDPD is a modified version of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), a particle-based mesh free method. There have been several attempts to analytically model the influence of solid walls and non-periodic boundary conditions in the DPD approach. However, there is a limited number of studies for these boundary conditions associated with MDPD that capture static and dynamic fluid-structure interactions through direct modeling of fluid-solid particle interactions. This work, for the first time, employs an analytical model (integral approach) for the solid wall boundary condition in MDPD that brings substantial gain in computational efficiency and thus expands the scope of its applicability to curved or complex walls. Furthermore, a modified model of conservative force is used in the current investigation. The model is first normalized to address the discrepancies in wetting that exist in the present literature and is then validated through several benchmark studies and test cases, such as a Wenzel model. Moreover, comparisons between both the fully numerical and the semi-analytical (integral force model) approaches are drawn. Time efficiency, accuracy, density fluctuation in vicinity of solid wall, and limitations of the proposed model are thoroughly discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The discrete adjoint of an incompressible Navier-Stokes algorithm in generalized coordinates is derived and applied to estimate the states of saturated and turbulent circular Couette flows. The forward Navier-Stokes model is based on the fractional-step algorithm in curvilinear coordinates on a structured grid [1], which has been widely adopted in direct numerical simulations of transitional and turbulent flows. The discrete adjoint equations adopt the same stencil and temporal scheme as the forward discretization, and expressions are derived that relate the discrete adjoint variables to their continuous counterpart. The key ingredients of the forward algorithm can be retained in the adjoint, including the computation of the cell geometry, the approximate factorization method, and the parallelization strategy. The accuracy, efficiency, and stability of the adjoint solver are also commensurate with the forward model. In addition, a novel symmetric projector is proposed to guarantee that the outcome of the adjoint algorithm is divergence free. The implementation of the algorithm in double precision satisfies the forward-adjoint relation up to eight significant figures, and further validation is performed using circular Couette flow. The forward and adjoint growth rates of instability modes from linear theory are accurately reproduced. In addition, an adjoint-variational data-assimilation algorithm (4DVar) is adopted to reconstruct the initial condition of circular Couette flows from limited measurements, obtained from an independent simulation. When the flow is comprised of saturated wavy vortices, wall measurements are sufficient to reconstruct an initial condition that latches onto the target state after a short time. For the more challenging turbulent case, coarse-grained velocity data are used to estimate the initial condition. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we present a high-order arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) method for compressible single-material flow on adaptive moving unstructured meshes. The discretization of system is implemented by Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) method. The vertex velocity is given by the approach of mesh movement from G. Chen et al. (2008) [8]. The new mesh can be automatically redistributed and concentrated on the regions with large gradient value of the variables. A HWENO reconstruction is used to eliminate false oscillations which maintains compactness of DG methods. In addition, we prove the property that the material derivatives of the Lagrangian basis functions are equal to zero with which the scheme is shown to satisfy the geometric conservation law (GCL). Furthermore, the scheme is conservative for mass, momentum and total energy. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the good performance and high-order accuracy of the scheme.

AB A critical challenge in the data-driven modeling of dynamical systems is producing methods robust to measurement error, particularly when data is limited. Many leading methods either rely on denoising prior to learning or on access to large volumes of data to average over the effect of noise. We propose a novel paradigm for data-driven modeling that simultaneously learns the dynamics and estimates the measurement noise at each observation. By constraining our learning algorithm, our method explicitly accounts for measurement error in the map between observations, treating both the measurement error and the dynamics as unknowns to be identified, rather than assuming idealized noiseless trajectories. We model the unknown vector field using a deep neural network, imposing a Runge-Kutta integrator structure to isolate this vector field, even when the data has a non-uniform timestep, thus constraining and focusing the modeling effort. We demonstrate the ability of this framework to form predictive models on a variety of canonical test problems of increasing complexity and show that it is robust to substantial amounts of measurement error. We also discuss issues with the generalizability of neural network models for dynamical systems and provide open-source code for all examples. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper studies the physical-constraints-preserving (PCP) Lagrangian finite volume schemes for one-and two-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamic (RHD) equations. First, the PCP property (i.e. preserving the positivity of the rest-mass density and the pressure and the bound of the velocity) is proved for the first-order accurate Lagrangian scheme with the HLLC Riemann solver and forward Euler time discretization. The key is that the intermediate states in the HLLC Riemann solver are shown to be admissible or PCP when the HLLC wave speeds are estimated suitably. Then, the higher-order accurate schemes are proposed by using the high-order accurate strong stability preserving (SSP) time discretizations and the scaling PCP limiter as well as the WENO reconstruction. Finally, several one-and two-dimensional numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and the effectiveness of the PCP Lagrangian schemes in solving the special RHD problems involving strong discontinuities, or large Lorentz factor, or low rest-mass density or low pressure, etc. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB A moving mesh discontinuous Galerkin method is presented for the numerical solution of hyperbolic conservation laws. The method is a combination of the discontinuous Galerkin method and the mesh movement strategy which is based on the moving mesh partial differential equation approach and moves the mesh continuously in time and orderly in space. It discretizes hyperbolic conservation laws on moving meshes in the quasi-Lagrangian fashion with which the mesh movement is treated continuously and no interpolation is needed for physical variables from the old mesh to the new one. Two convection terms are induced by the mesh movement and their discretization is incorporated naturally in the DG formulation. Numerical results for a selection of one- and two-dimensional scalar and system conservation laws are presented. It is shown that the moving mesh DG method achieves the second and third order of convergence for P-1 and P-2 elements, respectively, for problems with smooth solutions and is able to capture shocks and concentrate mesh points in non-smooth regions. Its advantage over uniform meshes and its insensitiveness to mesh smoothness are also demonstrated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A Galerkin-free model reduction approach for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) is presented in this article. The reduced order model (ROM) is based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), where a reduced basis is formed using energy dominant POD modes. The reduced basis also consists of characteristics POD time modes that are derived from the POD time modes (coefficients) by using their periodicity. In addition to flow variables, the solution state vector comprises the mesh deformation, taking into account the structural deformation in FSI. A ROM solution is obtained by performing a linear interpolation of the reduced basis for changing operating/ control parameters. The proposed Galerkin-free POD-ROM approach is demonstrated in terms of two test cases: a canonical case study of vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of a cylinder at Reynolds number Re = 100, where simulations are performed for various structural-to-fluid mass ratios; and a shock wave boundary layer induced panel flutter. For the second case, we use previously computed high-fidelity simulations, considering only the effect of panel thickness on the aeroelastic coupling between the flexible panel and shock wave boundary layer interaction (SWBLI); the inflow is at Mach 2 and Reynolds number based on panel length Re-a = 50000. The presented Galerking-free ROM procedure is clean and robust for large mesh deformations, in addition to a significantly lower cost of computation compared to the FSI high-fidelity simulations.

AB In a two-way coupled Euler-Lagrange simulation, particles are approximated as point sources and their momentum and energy exchange with the surrounding flow are modeled through point-particle force and heat transfer models. As the particle size increases and approaches the Eulerian grid, the feedback force and heat transfer become large and strongly affect the local flow at the particle location. The fluid velocity and temperature computed in the EL simulation when interpolated to the particle location will be substantially different from the corresponding undisturbed values. In this work we will follow the approach pursued in Balachandar et al. (2018) [1] for self-induced velocity correction to develop an analogous correction procedure for self-induced temperature. We obtain analytical solutions for the self-induced thermal perturbation for a steady uniform cross flow past a Gaussian filtered heat source under both steady and unsteady conditions. The analytical results are extended to finite Peclet number using numerical simulations. The resulting quasi-steady and unsteady models are tested with a simple problem of exponential thermal evolution against the corresponding EL simulation results. We also provide a simple criterion for when the self-induced temperature correction is needed in an Euler-Lagrange simulation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In a previous paper, [1], a new formulation for isothermal gas flow in a single pipeline including gravity and friction effects has been introduced and solved by finite element methods. A performance analysis has been done by using some tests both manufactured and experimental. The goal of the present work is to extend the ideas to model gas flow in a transportation network. As a first step, in this paper the network only includes pipes connected at nodes which can be emission or consumption points, or simply structural connections between pipes. In addition to the mass and momentum conservation equations inside the pipes that are partial differential equations, we need to write the mass conservation equations at the nodes. The latter appear to be a set of constraints (one per node) whose respective Lagrange multipliers are the (continuous) pressures at the nodes. Thus, the whole model is a Partial Differential-Algebraic Equation (PDAE). For numerical solution, an implicit time discretization is proposed first and then a weak formulation of the resulting semi-discrete problem is introduced. After doing a finite element discretization we are led to solve a nonlinear system of numerical equations per time step what is done by Newton's method. In order to reduce the computing time, the algorithm can be parallelized in such a way that, at each time step, every pipe can be solved separately in one processor (or core). Moreover, we show that the proposed scheme exactly conserves the mass at the nodes and in the whole network, and a new simple and compact way of computing the network line-pack over the time is given. Finally, the introduced methodology is validated by applying the computer program to a triangular network, which is a standard test in references on the subject, and to a real network for which we have got measurements that enable us to create the boundary conditions for the model and also to compare the numerical results with experimental data.

DE Algorithm for Magnetic field calculations
AB An algorithm is presented to calculate the field components of the magnetic field [B-x(x, y, z), B-y(x, y, z), B-z(x, y, z)] at a point (x, y, z) in space, from the knowledge of the components [B-x(x, y = 0, z), B-y(x, y = 0, z), B-z(x, y = 0, z)] on a "reference plane", which is normal to the y-axis at y = 0. The algorithm, which is a general one and is not restricted to fields with mid-plane symmetry is based on the Maclaurin series expansion of the magnetic field components at any point in space in terms of the distance (y) of the point from the reference plane. The coefficients of the Maclaurin series expansion are expressed in terms of the on-plane field components and their partial derivatives with respect to spatial coordinates (x, z). The field components are usually generated from magnetic field measurements on a rectangular grid on the plane. This algorithm was employed in 1986 in the RAYTRACE computer code to help calculate the optical properties of magnets and of the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). A general mathematical formulation of this algorithm based on the differential algebraic method was presented by Makino in 2011. This paper presents the step by step derivation of the algorithm and provides the necessary formulas to be introduced by the reader in any computer code which requires the field components generated by magnetic devices. In addition provides an example of the use of the algorithm and its limitations as applied to a Halbach type magnet with or without median plane symmetry. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study develops a new Lagrangian particle method for modeling flow and transport phenomena in complex porous media with discontinuities. For instance, diffusion processes can be modeled by Lagrangian Random Walk algorithms. However, discontinuities and heterogeneities are difficult to treat, particularly discontinuous diffusion D (x) or porosity theta (x). In the literature on particle Random Walks, previous methods used to handle this discontinuity problem can be characterized into two main classes as follows: "Interpolation techniques", and "Partial reflection methods". One of the main drawbacks of these methods is the small time step required in order to converge to the expected solution, particularly in the presence of many interfaces. These restrictions on the time step, lead to inefficient algorithms. The Random Walk Particle Tracking (RWPT) algorithm proposed here is, like others in the literature, discrete in time and continuous in space (gridless). We propose a novel approach to partial reflection schemes without restrictions on time step size. The new RWPT algorithm is based on an adaptive "Stop&Go" time-stepping, combined with partial reflection/refraction schemes, and extended with a new concept of negative mass particles. To test the new RWPT scheme, we develop analytical and semi-analytical solutions for diffusion in the presence of multiple interfaces (discontinuous multi-layered medium). The results show that the proposed Stop&Go RWPT scheme (with adaptive negative mass particles) fits extremely well the semi-analytical solutions, even for very high contrasts and in the neighborhood of interfaces. The scheme provides a correct diffusive solution in only a few macro-time steps, with a precision that does not depend on their size. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An efficient partition of unity finite element method for three-dimensional transient diffusion problems is presented. A class of multiple exponential functions independent of time variable is proposed to enrich the finite element approximations. As a consequence of this procedure, the associated matrix for the linear system is evaluated once at the first time step and the solution is obtained at subsequent time step by only updating the right-hand side of the linear system. This results in an efficient numerical solver for transient diffusion equations in three space dimensions. Compared to the conventional finite element methods with h-refinement, the proposed approach is simple, more efficient and more accurate. The performance of the proposed method is assessed using several test examples for transient diffusion in three space dimensions. We present numerical results for a transient diffusion equation with known analytical solution to quantify errors for the new method. We also solve time-dependent diffusion problems in complex geometries. We compare the results obtained using the partition of unity finite element method to those obtained using the standard finite element method. It is shown that the proposed method strongly reduces the necessary number of degrees of freedom to achieve a prescribed accuracy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Such problems as computation of spectra of spin chains and vibrational spectra of molecules can be written as high-dimensional eigenvalue problems, i.e., when the eigenvector can be naturally represented as a multidimensional tensor. Tensor methods have proven to be an efficient tool for the approximation of solutions of high-dimensional eigenvalue problems, however, their performance deteriorates quickly when the number of eigenstates to be computed increases. We address this issue by designing a new algorithm motivated by the ideas of Riemannian optimization (optimization on smooth manifolds) for the approximation of multiple eigenstates in the tensor-train format, which is also known as matrix product state representation. The proposed algorithm is implemented in TensorFlow, which allows for both CPU and GPU parallelization. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, an improved implicit discrete velocity method (DVM) on unstructured meshes is developed for simulation of three-dimensional (3D) flows in all flow regimes. Different from the conventional DVM, in which only the kinetic governing equation (i.e., Boltzmann equation) is resolved in each time step, both the kinetic and macroscopic governing equations are solved simultaneously in the present method. On one hand, the solution of macroscopic governing equation yields the predicted equilibrium distribution function at cell center, which enables the fully implicit discretization of the collision term in solving the Shakhov-model kinetic equation. On the other hand, the collisional effect at the cell interface can be incorporated into the evaluation of numerical flux through the solution process of macroscopic governing equation. Thanks to these two improvements, the developed scheme can effectively overcome the defects of low efficiency and poor accuracy of the conventional semi-implicit DVM in the continuum flow regime. In addition, for practical applications of flow problems with complicated geometry, in the present work, the unstructured mesh-based solver is developed. The accuracy, efficiency, stability and flexibility of the developed solver are demonstrated by its application to simulate pipe flow, lid-driven cavity flow and supersonic flow around a blunt body.

After spatial discretization, local approximation of the hypersurface and application of the GAUSSIAN divergence theorem, the volume integrals are transformed to surface integrals. Application of the surface divergence theorem allows for a further reduction to line integrals which are advantageous for numerical quadrature. We discuss the theoretical foundations and provide details of the numerical algorithm. Finally, we present numerical results for convex and non-convex hypersurfaces embedded in cuboidal domains, showing both high accuracy and third-to fourth-order convergence in space.

AB Modeling the behavior of complex systems is notoriously difficult given approximate simulation models, parametric uncertainty, and limited and noisy data. To address such difficulty and harness information from both model forecast and observation, we propose a novel particle filter framework with the generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) method. By constructing a gPC expansion for the system state of interest, our framework delivers a system assimilation procedure that updates gPC coefficients when observations of the system are available, and whose forward model is defined by the stochastic Galerkin method. In this way, one can not only estimate the system state for specific realizations but also its statistical moments, and even the probability density function. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through four numerical examples. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a coupled volume-of-fluid (VOF) and level set (LS) method on general curvilinear grids, combining the advantages of VOF method and LS method is developed for interfacial flow simulations. In this method, an iterative geometric operation is introduced to calculate the level set function on physical domain and computational domain. In particular, a direct construction of the distance function is successfully implemented on the physical domain and thus the numerical error induced by contravariant transformation from the computational domain could be avoided. The level set based continuum surface tension (CSF) model on curvilinear grids is derived to model surface tension accurately, and then the model as well as the proposed coupled volume tracking method is incorporated into an incompressible Navier-Stokes solver. Finally, four benchmark problems including time-reversed single vortex flow, static droplet, dam break and single bubble rising problems are tested on irregular domains to validate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method to deal with complex domains. The results show good agreement with previous experimental data or numerical results, good characteristics of mass conservation are also observed, indicating that the present method can accurately simulate incompressible two-phase flows.

AB A hierarchical solver is proposed for solving sparse ill-conditioned linear systems in parallel. The solver is based on a modification of the LoRaSp method, but employs a deferred-compression technique, which provably reduces the approximation error and significantly improves efficiency. Moreover, the deferred-compression technique introduces minimal overhead and does not affect parallelism. As a result, the new solver achieves linear computational complexity under mild assumptions and excellent parallel scalability. To demonstrate the performance of the new solver, we focus on applying it to solve sparse linear systems arising from ice sheet modeling. The strong anisotropic phenomena associated with the thin structure of ice sheets creates serious challenges for existing solvers. To address the anisotropy, we additionally developed a customized partitioning scheme for the solver, which captures the strong-coupling direction accurately. In general, the partitioning can be computed algebraically with existing software packages, and thus the new solver is generalizable for solving other sparse linear systems. Our results show that ice sheet problems of about 300 million degrees of freedom have been solved in just a few minutes using 1024 processors. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The standard particle-in-cell algorithm suffers from grid heating. There exists a gridless alternative which bypasses the deposition step and calculates each Fourier mode of the charge density directly from the particle positions. We show that a gridless method can be computed efficiently through the use of an Unequally Spaced Fast Fourier Transform (USFFT) algorithm. After a spectral field solve, the forces on the particles are calculated via the inverse USFFT (a rapid solution of an approximate linear system) [1,2]. We provide one and two dimensional implementations of this algorithm with an asymptotic runtime of O(N-p + N-m(D) log N-m(D)) for each iteration, identical to the standard PIC algorithm (where N-p is the number of particles, N-m is the number of Fourier modes, and Dis the spatial dimensionality of the problem). We demonstrate superior energy conservation and reduced noise, as well as convergence of the energy conservation at small time steps. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Tree-based mesh grids bring the advantage of using fast cartesian discretizations, such as finite differences, and the flexibility and accuracy of local mesh refinement. The main challenge is how to adapt the discretization stencil near the interfaces between grid elements of different sizes, which is usually solved by local high-order geometrical interpolations. These interpolations depend on the distribution of cells in the vicinity of the point of interest, hence they are site-specific and can become quite complex in three-dimensional simulations, specially when dealing with staggered unknown arrangements. Most methods usually avoid this by limiting the mesh configuration (usually to graded quadtree/octree grids), reducing the number of cases to be treated locally. In this work, we propose a robust method based on a moving least squares meshless interpolation technique, which is employed to compute the weights of the finite difference approximation in a given hierarchical grid, allowing for complex mesh configurations, still keeping the overall order of accuracy of the resulting method. Numerical convergence tests and application to fluid flow simulations are performed to illustrate the flexibility, robustness and accuracy of this new approach. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

ID RUNGE-KUTTA METHODS; COLLOCATION METHODS; ALGORITHMS
AB It is well known that various dynamical systems preserve volume in phase space such as all Hamiltonian systems. This qualitative geometrical property of the analytical solution should be respected in the sense of Geometric Integration. This paper studies the volume-preserving property of exponential integrators for different vector fields. For exponential integrators, we first derive a necessary and sufficient condition of volume preservation. Then based on this condition, volume-preserving exponential integrators are discussed in detail for four kinds of vector fields. It is shown that symplectic exponential integrators can be volume preserving for a much larger class of vector fields than Hamiltonian systems. On the basis of the analysis, some applications of volume-preserving exponential integrators are discussed. For solving highly oscillatory second-order systems, novel volume-preserving exponential integrators are derived, and for separable partitioned systems, extended Runge-Kutta-Nystrom (ERKN) integrators of volume preservation are presented. Moreover, the volume preservation of Runge-Kutta-Nystrom (RKN) methods is also discussed. Five illustrative numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the notable superiority of volume-preserving exponential integrators in comparison with volume-preserving Runge-Kutta methods.

AB We present a new Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate diffusion processes in presence of discontinuous convective and diffusive terms. The algorithm is based on the knowledge of close form analytic expressions of the resolvents of the diffusion processes which are usually easier to obtain than close form analytic expressions of the density. In the case of diffusion processes with piecewise constant coefficients, known as Skew Diffusions, such close form expressions for the resolvent are available. Then we apply our algorithm to this particular case and we show that the approximate densities of the particles given by the algorithm replicate the particularities of the true densities well (discontinuities, bimodality, ...). Besides, numerical experiments show a quick convergence. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Considering the health risks of E. coli O157:H7 presence in food and water, an affordable and highly sensitive detection method is crucial. Herein, we report the first use of a single antibody-based fluorescent lateral flow immunoassay (FLFIA) depending on non-radiative energy transfer between graphene oxide and quantum dots for determination of E. coli O157: H7 in beef and river water. FLFIA showed a high sensitivity rate thousand-fold better than the conventional lateral flow (LF). In inoculated minced beef and river water samples, the limits of detection were 178 and 133 CFU g(-1) or mL(-1), respectively. Besides, it presented a high selectivity in the presence of other possible interfering bacteria. The single antibody approach reduced the assay cost to 60% less than the conventional LF. Alongside, the results could be read by portable LF readers or smartphones. These advantages offer FLFIA as a promising technology for pathogen detection in food and water.

AB This work studied the effect of multi-wavelength UV processing on the ascorbic acid content of aqueous solutions, at different pH values (3, 4, and 5). The source of radiation was a mid-pressure mercury lamp (460 W), emitting between 250 and 740 nm. The samples were treated for 60 min, at 25 degrees C and 45 degrees C, with the lamp on and with the lamp off. A radiation balance was performed to estimate the total radiation power absorbed by the whole solution. Ascorbic acid content was reduced, either in irradiated or non-irradiated solutions, due to aerobic oxidation. But, in most cases, irradiation did not accelerate degradation. This can be explained by the fact that ascorbic acid barley absorbs ultraviolet in the interval of wavelengths emitted by the lamp (only 31% of the incident radiation P(0) could be absorbed by the solutions). Therefore, mid-pressure mercury lamps are helpful to avoid Vitamin C photo-degradation.

AB Argan oil is precious oil with food and cosmetic uses. In recent years, this oil has been subject to an increasing national and international demand. The present work aims at studying the effect of clones and age, year of harvest and geographical origin on Argan oil quality and chemical composition. The results indicate that age does not affect Argan oil quality and fatty acids content. However, clones had a significant effect on fatty acids and tocopherol levels. Saturated and unsaturated fatty acids were highly influenced by the year of harvest and geographical origin, presumably due to climatic conditions. Unsaturated fatty acids varied from 78.28% to 81.77%. Depending on clones, total tocopherols varied from 687.40 mg/kg to 1068 mg/kg. This study is useful for the choice of clones with the aim of developing Argan trees orchards destined to oil production.

Co-MPs' adsorbent properties were tested and validated for their selectiveness to lead. Only with a few and short extraction steps (i.e. adding MPs, mixing, decanting and eluting) analyte was extracted from sample solution rapidly and efficiently. Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for the developed method (Co-MP-DSPME-SQT-FAAS) were found to be 7.77 mu g/L and 25.9 mu g/L, respectively. Matrix matching strategy was performed and outcomes indicated that the developed method is applicable with the high percent recovery values of 110.1 +/- 4.5 and % 102.9 +/- 4.2 for 100 and 300 mu g/kg lead standard spiked black tea samples, respectively. The method was also applied to standard reference material to check the accuracy of the method.

AB This second paper provides chemical insight of the different phenomena occurring in bread during storage with and without anti-staling enzymes by using near infrared spectroscopy and chemometrics. The target, thus, is three-fold: (1) To monitor the staling process in the top, middle and bottom parts of the white bread loaf by near infrared spectroscopy and to extract chemical information of the different chemical mechanisms occurring in the staling process; (2) to assess the correlation between the near infrared spectroscopy and spatial texture profile analysis in terms of hardness, and (3) to demonstrate the anti-staling effect of the enzymes by showing a collapse of the correlation between near infrared (NIR) spectra and hardness as measured by texture analysis. It is found that NIR spectroscopy in combination with chemometrics (Partial Least Squares Regression) can predict the hardness development of the control bread.

AB In this work, three versions of the QuEChERS method (original, AOAC 2007.01 and CEN 15662) were evaluated for the extraction of 38 multiclass pesticides from a mixture of five dried fruits: (strawberry, blackberry, passion fruit, pineapple and grapes) prior to their gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Among them, the AOAC 2007.01 method provided the best results in terms of lower amount of matrix co-extractives, matrix effect, extraction efficiency and precision. Its application to the analysis of the same pesticides in the individual dried fruits provided good recovery (between 70 and 120%) and relative standard deviation values (<20%) for most pesticides at three spiked levels. Matrix effect assessment revealed the necessity of taking into account such effect. Matrix-matched calibration data were also satisfactory for all analytes and matrices being the R-2 >= 0.9900 and the lowest calibration level 5 mu g/kg, which is lower than the agreed limit set at 10 mu g/kg for monitoring purposes in food applications. Three samples of each type were also analysed, finding residues of metalaxyl, chlorpyrifos and iprodione in some of them.

AB Yeast nitrogen metabolism produces metabolites, whose origin in wines has scarcely been studied, with an important biological and organoleptic role. The present work focuses on comparing three intracellular extraction methods in order to elucidate efficiency of extraction while measuring the effect of temperature upon the integrity of the compounds related to the metabolism of tryptophan and tyrosine by yeast.
   Two UHPLC/HRMS methods to measure 16 metabolites were developed and validated. The validation provided optimum values of LOD (7.4.10(-6) to 0.1 mu g L-1), of LOQ (2.10(-5) to 0.02 mu g L-1) of precision (11-0.5% RSD) and repeatability (12-0.5% RSD). The removal of interfering molecules enabled matrix effects to be kept at low levels.
   The results pointed out that the low-temperature methods were more effective, providing better precision for 16 metabolites. The high-temperature extraction method may yield false enhanced compounds concentrations since they originate in cell wall macromolecules degradation.

AB In this study, fruits of two nectarine cultivars, harvested at commercial ripeness, were sorted into three density groups. Physicochemical parameters (mean weight, firmness, dry matter, soluble solids content, titratable acidity) and the levels of sugars, organic acids, vitamin C, polyphenols and volatiles were then determined at harvest and after ripening. A sensory ranking test was also performed on ripened nectarines to compare quality attributes (firmness, sweetness, acidity, and aroma). In both cultivars, ripened nectarines of higher density had significantly higher levels of dry matter, soluble solids content, sugars, ascorbic acid, polyphenols and volatiles. Among polyphenols, the levels of hydroxycinnamic acids were 30-40% significantly higher in nectarines of higher density. Among volatiles, levels of lactones, well-known key aroma compounds in nectarines, were also 2-3 times significantly higher in ripened fruits of higher density. Consistent with these results, nectarines of higher density were significantly ranked sweeter and more aromatic in both cultivars.

AB Ultrasonic effect on extraction of cyanidin-3-galactoside (Cy3-gal) from pear fruit peel was investigated and compared with conventional extraction (CE) method. Different process factors were tested to determine the optimum conditions for ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE). Results revealed that under optimized UAE conditions (ultrasonic power = 162 W, temperature = 71 degrees C, trifluoroacetic acid = 3%, ethanol = 57%, ultra-sonication time = 11 min, and sample to solvent ratio = 1: 30 g/ml), Cy3-gal yield was significantly higher (0.34 3 +/- 0.005 mg/g) than from CE (0.266 +/- 0.004 mg/g), whereas the extract viscosity during UAE showed a negative impact. UPLC-Triple-TOF/MS analysis detected a total number of 13 anthocyanin compounds, out of which 8 were identified and that mainly consisted of cyanidin, delphinidin and petunidin compounds. Higher yield of Cy3-gal under UAE compared to CE was also justified by higher deformations in the cell structure. The possible mechanism of ultrasonication effect during the extraction process is also proposed in the present study. During scale-up UAE process, the extraction yield of Cy3-gal was recorded higher under batch scale-up compared to continuous operation. The present study is an attempt to optimize UAE of valuable anthocyanins from Pyrus communis 'Starkrimson' fruit peel and further scaled-up for higher volume extraction which can be utilized for industrial applications.

AB The present research was carried out to analyze the effect of chemical composition, granule morphology and crystalline structure of pigmented rice starches on their functional characteristics. The starches of these rice cultivars were observed to possess novel characteristic as compared to hybrids or non-pigmented cultivars in terms of physicochemical, pasting and thermal characteristics. The diameter of the analyzed starch particles depicted a considerable range varying from 5.139 mu m to 8.453 mu m as their median particle size visualized at x50. The color values of the analyzed starch samples indicated a high degree of whiteness and purity. The compact nature of starch granules in Kaw quder and Kaw kareed rice cultivars accounted for their higher transition temperatures as compared to other cultivars. Crystalline pattern by X-Ray diffractometer showed an A-type pattern for analyzing starches. The starch granules showed the irregular polyhedral morphology with spherical granules having a polyhedral angular shaped morphology packed tightly with a relatively smooth surface.

AB In this study, through in-situ polymerization process, a novel composite of attapulgite/hydrophilic molecularly imprinted monolithic resin (AT/HMIMR) were prepared in pipette tips for extraction trace plant growth regulators in cucumbers. In the preparation procedure, fibrillar attapulgite nanoparticles were embedded to increase extraction capacity, polyethyleneglycol-6000 was employed as a dual-function porogen, that acted as both the structure-directing agent of the HMIMR and the attapulgite dispersant. N-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride was used as a dummy template to accurate quantification on extraction procedures. Experimental parameters of AT/HMIMR for extracting plant growth regulators from cucumbers were optimized, and the results showed that the recoveries of ranged from 92.4% to 101.1% with relative standard deviations= 6.5% (n=3). Considering its microporous monolithic column structure, multiple adsorption mechanism, and specific selectivity, AT/HMIMR shows promise for applications that require specific recognition for the analytes in real complex samples.

AB Wheat dough has been considered as a complex blend where gluten forms the continuous reticular skeleton and starch granules act as filling particles. The effect of starch on dough behaviors is not clear and the mechanism of starch affecting dough properties needs to be revealed. In this study, the micro-structure and physiochemical properties of starch from six wheat varieties (lines) with different dough properties were investigated, and the rheological properties of wheat dough were determined. Six varieties with significant different starch properties perform various dough behaviors, among which Xinmai 26 with preeminent dough quality has the highest amylose content, B-type starch granule content, short-range ordered degree and starch swelling power but lowest relative crystallinity and gelatinization enthalpy of starch. The findings indicate that starch physicochemical properties also influence the dough behaviors and provide helpful information for demonstrating the effects of starch on dough properties in the protein-starch matrix.

AB Retrogradation is inevitable during the storage of starchy products. Retrogradation behavior of starches (e.g., amylopectin and amylose) has been widely investigated. We firstly studied the retrogradation behavior of short linear glucan debranched from amylopectin with different degrees of polymerization (DP). With increasing DP, the retrogradation enthalpy change (Delta H) of debranched starch (DBS) increased. At a DBS to water ratio of 1: 2 and a storage time of 0 min, the retrogradation Delta H of DBS samples (DP 11.96, 12.62, and 13.36) reached up to 6.03 +/- 0.41, 8.03 +/- 0.53, and 12.80 +/- 1.57 J/g, respectively. The greater the short-chain length, the more rapid the retrogradation of DBS. The peak temperature of retrograded DBS (101.95-111.53 degrees C) with a DBS to water ratio of 1: 2 stored at 50 degrees C was greater than that stored at 4 degrees C. The retrogradation of DBS was rapid, taking only 0-120 min, corresponding to ultra-short-term retrogradation.

AB Interactions among food components during food processing play important role in starch digestibility. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of heat moisture treatment on the structural, physicochemical, and digestibility properties of starch-soybean peptide complexes. Corn and potato starch mixed with different amounts of soybean peptide were subjected to heat moisture treatment. The addition of soybean peptide increased pasting temperature, while decreased peak viscosity and swelling power in both starch samples under heat moisture treatment. Thermal analysis showed that soybean peptide retarded starch gelatinization, and heat moisture treatment contributed to a more stable crystalline structure. Lower RDS contents and higher RS contents were associated with higher soybean peptide amounts. Potato starch was more sensitive to heat moisture treatment than corn starch. The results will enrich the interaction theory between starch and protein, and will be important for the development of carbohydrate-restricted diet and protein-based functional foods.

AB Nonthermal plasma treatment has been a widely acknowledged effective method for food sterilization. This study presents the potential of nonthermal dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma treatment for sterilization of the surface of the fresh wet noodles (FWNs). The plasma treatment achieved a more than one logarithmic reduction of the total bacterial count and total mold count as measured by counting the total microorganisms and filamentous fungi, respectively. In addition, the qualities of FWNs exposed to nonthermal DBD plasma treatment had no undesirable changes to color, texture, acidity and water distribution as measured by a texture analyzer, color meter and low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR), respectively. Thus, nonthermal DBD plasma treatment is a promising alternative to the traditional sterilization method applied in FWN industry and provides a new idea for the preservation and processing of fresh food.

AB Muscle foods, particularly fish products are highly exposed to oxidative stress during processing and storage, resulting in oxidative modification of proteins. Protein carbonyls content has been used as one of the measures of oxidative stress. Generally, the resulting carbonylated proteins (CPs) have so far been labeled with 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) hydrazine and detected with anti-DNP antibody. However, the applicability of this method to food samples is limited by its high price, time-consuming procedure and possibility to perform the measurements just on soluble protein fractions. We developed a simpler, faster and cheaper method to assess CP level in muscle foods, including both soluble and insoluble protein fractions, which is based on a direct reaction of protein carbonyls with 7-(diethylamino) coumarin-3-carbohydrazide (CHH). The paper describes a novel technique to label both soluble and insoluble carbonylated proteins with CHH and determine carbonyl content by fluorescence microscopy assay which correlates (R=0.911) with conventional ELISA method.

AB Diatoms are a major group of high omega 3-fatty acid producing algae that play a key role in global climate change and ecosystem function. Phaeodactylum tricornutum is one of only two diatoms whose genomes have been completely sequenced, leading to metabolic engineering of high eicosapentaenoic acid producing strains. Based on its rapid growth, high lipid content, and especially omega-3 long chain unsaturated fatty acids, P. tricornutum exhibits a large commercial potential. However, until now, it is predominately produced as feed for the aquaculture industry, rather than food supplement. This review compares the change of P. tricornutum lipid composition under different treatments, and identifies suitable lipid induction, cultivation and harvesting methods for industry adoption. If produced in a biorefinery setting, P. tricornutum has strong potential for value generation from human health products (omega-3-rich oil and high-value protein) with cost estimates of AU$6.14 per kg dry weight and AU$20.47 for omega-3-rich oil.

AB A study was conducted on the effects occurred in rheological properties of base flour dough by the addition of gluten, glutenin and purified low molecular weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) using a 4 g sample Microdoughlab (MDL). Incorporation of these elements brought about a significant increase in the dough strength in the order of LMW-GS < gluten < glutenin. LMW-GS from variety C 306 brought a decrease in the dough development time (DDT; 2.03 min), dough stability (DS; 3 min) and peak energy (EP; 2.90 Wh/kg) values. On the contrary, the effects of LMW-GS extracted from variety PBW 550 were more strong as indicated by an increase in DDT (2.75 min), DS (3.30 min) and EP (4.20 Wh/kg). The alterations in the microstructure of dough by the inclusion of gluten, glutenin and LMW-GS, which lacks resemblance among different samples, were contemplated subjecting it to Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).

AB The presence of the pyrethroids residues in different samples and the impact on human health is an increasing concern due to their widespread use. So, a method to determine eighteen pyrethroids in fish samples using a modified QuEChERS was developed. The clean-up procedure was performed by freezing samples overnight followed by dispersive solid phase extraction. The combination of C-18, PSA and Z-Sep+ was optimized using a mixture design approach and samples were analysed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The method was validated using trahira samples and a scope extension was performed for tilapia and tainha. Recoveries were within 63-129%, relative standard deviation was <= 21.5% and the quantification limits were 5 mu g kg(-1) or 10 mu g kg(-1). The applicability of the method was assessed by analysis of fourteen real samples, in which residues were detected in four samples. Such detections demonstrate the importance of this sensitive method.

AB Sand was studied as a solid support in ultrasound-assisted matrix solid-phase dispersion (UA-MSPD) for the extraction of different pesticide classes, including organophosphates, carbamates, triazoles and pyrethroids from fruits and vegetables, with determination by GC-MS and LC-MS/MS. The performance of sand was compared with that of different types of classic solid supports and alternative natural materials from renewable sources. The best results were obtained using 0.5 g sample, 1 g sand as a solid support, 20 mg activated charcoal and 5 mL ethyl acetate as elution solvent. Recoveries ranged from 55 to 140% with an RSD <= 20%. LOQs varied from 0.005 to 0.5 mg kg(-1) for all analytes. Thiamethoxam, captan, chlorpyrifos, dimethoate and pyrimethanil were found in strawberry samples at concentrations from 0.01 to 0.06 mg kg(-1). Acephate and tebuconazole were found in a tomato sample at concentrations of 0.45 and 0.30 mg kg(-1), respectively. The method developed was efficient, simple, cheap, robust, and environmentally friendly.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the extrusion moisture and temperature on the physical characteristics of breakfast cereals. The chemical composition, microbiological risk and acceptance of the selected breakfast cereal with the best physical quality were assessed to determine the technological viability of the use of these by-products by the food industry. The response surface method and a rotatable central composite design were used, and a desirability test was performed based on adjusted regression models. The breakfast cereal produced under these conditions had protein, lipid and dietary fiber contents of 7.55, 0.97 and 6.12 g 100 g(-1), respectively. In regards to the sensory analysis, the evaluated breakfast cereal received average acceptance scores ranging from "neither like or dislike" to "like moderately". The use of rice, passion fruit and milk by-products was shown to be an alternative for the production of extruded breakfast cereal.

AB A novel lipase gene (McLipB) was cloned from a thermophilic fungus Malbranchea cinnamomea and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The deduced amino acid sequence of the lipase (McLipB) shared the highest identity of 46% with the Candida rugosa lipase LIP4. The extracellular lipase activity of 4304 U/mL with protein concentration of 7.7 mg/mL was achieved in a 5-L fermentor. The optimal pH and temperature of McLipB were 7.5 and 40 degrees C, respectively. The lipase showed high specificity towards triglycerides with short and medium chain fatty acids, and had non-position specificity. McLipB hydrolyzed butter to produce mainly butyric acid, hexanoic acid and a small amount of octanoic acid and decanoic acid. Furthermore, it degraded more than 90% dipropyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate and dihexyl phthalate to their corresponding monoalkyl phthalates. The properties of McLipB indicate that it has great application potential for production of lipolyzed milkfat flavor and biodegradation of phthalate esters.

AB The main goals of this study were to determine the phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of table olives from Olea europaea L. cv. Cornezuelo, as well as the effect caused by a simulated in vitro digestion to evaluate compounds bioavailability. High-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array and mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-DAD-MSn) was used to evaluate the phytochemical profile, whereas conventional spectrophotometric methods (ABTS center dot(+) and DPPH) were used to determine the antioxidant activity. The mineral content was also quantified by inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry.
   Thirty compounds were identified, mainly polyphenols, quantifying the major compounds by HPLC-DAD. After the simulated digestion, the phenolic content suffered an important decrease - more than 50% - reaching losses of up to 75% for oleuropein and comselogoside isomers. This decrease also resulted in a loss of antioxidant activity, observing significant differences for all parameters. However, the analyzed extracts still retained considerable antioxidant potential.

AB Different Ohmic heating conditions (OH, 10, 100, and 1000 Hz at 25 V; 45, 60, and 80 V at 60 Hz) were assessed to manufacture whey-raspberry flavored beverages. The inhibition of alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase, and angiotensin-converting I enzymes, antioxidant capacity, fatty acid profile, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were determined. OH treated samples presented lower anthocyanins content than the conventional treatment (2.91 +/- 0.23 mg/g), while the mild-intermediate conditions (10,100-Hz at 25 V and 45,60-V at 60 Hz) presented the highest chemical antioxidant activity when compared to the extreme processing conditions (1000 Hz-25 V and 80 V-60 Hz). OH led to an increase of 10% in both alpha-glucosidase (> 99%) and alpha-amylase (>= 70%). Among the VOCs, furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, a major intermediate Maillard reaction product was found in all treatments. Overall, OH can be used in the processing of whey-flavored raspberry beverages.

AB Certain food properties (ex.: pH, polyphenolic composition) can inhibit digestive amylases and thereby slow down starch digestion. Our aim was twofold. (1) To determine the impact of 21 beverages and condiments (coffees, teas, wines, vinegars and lemon juice) on salivary and pancreatic amylolysis: inhibition ranged from 10% to 100% in our experimental conditions. (2) To investigate the effect of one black tea and lemon juice (selected for their strong inhibitory capacity) on starch hydrolysis during dynamic oro-gastro-intestinal digestion of bread. Compared to water (control), the effect of black tea was limited to a approximate to 20% reduction of released oligosaccharides during the intestinal phase. Lemon juice had a remarkable effect, completely interrupting gastric amylolysis by salivary amylase via a preliminary acidification of gastric contents. These results provide a strong biochemical rationale for the development of dietary strategies to improve the glycaemic impact of starch-rich meals which could be tested in vivo.

AB Plants conjugate monoterpenoids to sugars, rendering them non-volatile. Hydrolysis of these glycosidic precursors frees the volatile aroma compounds. Here, we profile intact monoterpenyl glycosides in six Vitis vinifera grape berry cultivars. Relative concentrations of twenty-six monoterpenyl glycosides, including nine new putatively identified compounds, were analyzed by UHPLC-QTOF MS/MS at three times during grape maturation (pre-veraison, veraison, and post-veraison). Total glycoside content reached a maximum in Muscat cultivars post-veraison but remained relatively constant in all other cultivars. Three types of monoterpenyl glycosides predominated in all samples: malonylated monoterpenol glucosides, monoterpenol hexose-pentoses, and monoterpendiol hexose-pentoses. The two Muscat cultivars were not differentiated at the earlier developmental stages but could be differentiated post-veraison. In contrast, similarities between Chardonnay and Pinot noir glycoside profiles developed post-veraison. Overall monoterpene glycoconjugation patterns may align with underlying genetic relationships among cultivars. By understanding monoterpene glycoconjugation in wine grapes, scientists and winemakers can better understand grape and wine aromas.

AB The possible interactions between alpha-zein and Ca2+ in nixtamalization process were analyzed from a multi-disciplinary approach, considering the effect of these interactions on the thermal properties of the nixtamalized flour. SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions did not reveal differences between patterns of zeins from nixtamalized and control samples. However, analysis from affinity capillary electrophoresis indicated an increment in protein volume when calcium is added to zein extracted from nixtamalized flour. In addition, the binding constant for the zein-calcium interaction was calculated indicating a higher affinity for calcium by zein from nixtamalized samples. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the interaction alpha-zein-Ca2+ through C-ter was more favorable than Glu48. However, in excess of Ca2+ ions, each site could bind one calcium atom at the same time, confirming that aggregation of alpha-zein through calcium bridges is possible, expanding the technological applications of this protein.

AB The present study evaluated the thermal properties of sponge cake batters with different functional ingredients, and the effects of their adding on starch gelatinization. Samples of sponge cake batter: with wheat flour (control batter), with a reduced quantity of wheat flour and addition of functional ingredients (sponge cake batter with 50% einkorn wholemeal flour, sponge cake batter with 20% Jerusalem artichoke powder, sponge cake batter with 35% cocoa husk powder) were investigated. Using the method of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) the starch gelatinization temperature intervals (degrees C) and energies of the different batters during baking were evaluated. Based on the experimental results, it could be concluded that the addition of functional ingredients in the cake batter retard the starch gelatinization. The gelatinization occurs at higher temperature and with higher energy consumption. The retarding effect of the functional ingredients is related to the water binding capacity and the presence of dietary fiber.

AB Complex starch is gaining research attention due to its unique physicochemical and functional properties. In this study, the effects of green tea polyphenols on the properties and digestion of lotus seed starch under high hydrostatic pressure were investigated. The particle size, swelling power, solubility, crystallization, morphology and thermal properties of lotus seed starch were affected by green tea polyphenols. These may be due to the formation of non-inclusive complexes between lotus seed starch and green tea polyphenols. The morphology and green tea polyphenols distribution of the complexes were determined by scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. In addition, slow digestion properties of starch were realized under a dynamic in vitro rat stomach-duodenum model and the erosion of granules by amylase gradually decreased by scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, green tea polyphenols were shown to be able to form V-type inclusion complex with amylose via high hydrostatic pressure.

AB To gain a better understanding concerning factors underlying carotenoid metabolism in banana pulp we investigated the carotenoid profile, metabolome, proteome and relative expression levels of carotegenesis-associated genes of fruit pulp in the two banana varieties ON and GN, with ON being characterized of high carotenoid accumulation. Results showed that high carotenoid content in banana pulp was well correlated with the relative expression of carotenogenesis-associated genes and the abundance of the corresponding proteins. An elevated accumulation of sugar metabolism-related compounds and a decreased amino acid accumulation were also observed in ON. Additionally proteins involved in the glycolytic pathway were more highly abundant in ON suggesting that this supports the higher accumulation of carotenoid in this genotype. We suggest that upregulated expression of carotenogenesis-associated genes alongside elevated carbohydrate accumulation contribute to high carotenoid content in banana pulp, implying that a multi-target approach is necessary in order to improve carotenoid content in banana.

AB Djulis (Chenopodiun formosaneum Koidz.,), pseudo-cereal crop emerged as a potential source of functional ingredients, was used to identify phytosterols and triterpenes from seven inbred lines of Djulis hull using GC-MS. Key bioactive compounds were identified including 6 phytosterols (34.73-59.48 mg/100 g), 6 triterpenes (30.56-57.47 mg/100 g), and 5 other unsaponifiable compounds (15.89-22.50 mg/100 g). Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted and explored the variation among Djulis hull samples with two clusters based on the surface color that reflected the content of phytosterols and triterpenes. These results confirmed that the color might be used as an indicator for estimation of phytosterol and triterpene contents in Djulis hull. Overall, this is the first study that identified novel unsaponifiable compounds in Djulis hull, which might contribute to the development of phytosterols and/or triterpenes enriched functional foods.

AB Effects of the brine solution with different NaOH concentrations on the physicochemical properties, intermolecular forces, and gel properties of duck egg whites were studied. The free alkalinity, salt content and surface hydrophobicity of egg whites increased as the pickling time and NaOH concentration increased. The primary intermolecular forces (disulfide bonds and hydrophobic interactions) in the alkali egg white gels were increased firstly and then decreased, resulting from the fact that the proteins were degraded under strong alkali conditions during the late stage of the pickling process. Changes of hardness and springiness of egg white gels were closely related with the interactions of the protein molecules. Thereinto, the change tendency of springiness was in accordance with the changes of hydrogen bond of egg white gels. The colour of the egg white gels obtained from alkali treatment changed from white to amber during pickling.

AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are primarily produced during the incomplete combustion of organic matter. PAHs are suspected endocrine disruptors and possible carcinogenic materials. The major sources of human exposure to PAHs are inhaled fumes and food. The aim of this study was to provide an alternative drying method to mitigate PAH formation in dried red peppers. We prepared dried red pepper samples using air-drying and heat pump-assisted drying methods, and measured the concentrations of four PAHs (PAH4), benzo[a]anthracene (B[a]A), chrysene (CHR), benzo[b]fluoranthene (B[b]F), and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), in the resulting pepper samples. The PAH concentrations ranged from 3.61 to 18.0 mu g/kg and from 2.22 to 8.35 mu g/kg in the air-dried and heat pump-dried pepper samples, respectively. Overall, the results have shown that dried peppers contain PAH4, that the drying conditions for these contaminants should be optimized for mitigating the PAH formation in dried red peppers.

AB A new microfluidic chemiluminescence (MF-CL) method for rapidly assaying the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of apple and pomegranate juices and honey samples was developed. The method exploited the NaHCO3-H2O2-Co2+ CL reaction. It was found that gallic acid (GA), catechin, caffeic acid, ferulic acid and rutin, as selected phenolic antioxidants, could suppress the CL reaction. The linear range and limit of detection of the method for the antioxidants were as follows: 0.5-3 mg L-1 and 0.27 mg L-1 for GA, 0.2-5.0 mg L-1 and 0.17 mg L-1 for catechin, 0.03-2.0 mg L-1 and 0.03 mg L-1 for caffeic acid, 0.3-2.0 mg L-1 and 0.23 mg L-1 for ferulic acid and 0.3-4.0 mg L-1 and 0.15 mg L-1 for rutin. GA was used as the standard, and the TAC of the fruit juices and honey samples as presented as GA equivalents (GAE). MF-CL was compared with DPPH center dot and Folin-Ciocalteau (FC) methods.

AB Imaging the microstructure of opaque composite foodstuffs and extracting quantitative chemical information about specific localized components is challenging. Herein, a method has been developed to determine spatially resolved concentrations of aqueous salt and applied to measure salt concentrations of water droplets in butter samples. This was done using Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) microscopy which achieves non-invasive label free imaging based on visualization of specific chemical-bond vibrations. The concentration of salt in the dispersed water droplets in butter was determined based on the relative change in intensity of the CARS-signal at two distinct wavenumbers, which have been shown to be dependent on the inter-molecular coupling of water molecules and salt. The results provide the size and salt concentration distribution of the droplets in the samples. It is further shown that the average salt concentration in the whole sample can correctly be inferred from the concentration measured within the water droplets.

AB The wide use of tetracyclines (TCs) for prevention and therapy of animal diseases may result in excessive residues in animal products, which could pose serious risks to human health. A novel molybdenum disulfide nanoplates (MoS2 NPs)-based fluorescent sensor for tetracycline (TET) is reported. The MoS2 NPs, synthesized via a facile bottom-up hydrothermal route, showed blue fluorescence at 430 nm in aqueous solution. Interestingly, its fluorescence was quenched significantly upon addition of TET, which is mainly due to a combination of the inner filter effect and electron transfer. Thus, the MoS2 NPs based fluorescence sensor was delineated for the detection of TET. The methodology here presented showed a low detection limit of 0.032 mu M and satisfied recoveries from 88.46% to 108.62% in spiked milk, milk powder and bovine muscle samples.

AB The effect of dietary fiber-rich fractions on the texture, thermal, water distribution, and gluten properties of frozen dough during storage was investigated. These fractions could greatly improve retention of the texture properties, which was mainly related to water loss, and changes in freezable water proportion (FW) and gluten secondary structure. Kinetic studies showed that the fractions could change the nucleation type and ice crystal growth rate, with konjac flour significantly decreasing the ice growth rate from 0.0177 to 0.0048. These fractions could decrease FW by 15%-27% and restrict water mobility during storage. Moreover, gluten beta-sheets shifted toward beta-turns, while the beta-sheet values of potato and okara flours showed no significant change during storage. SEM confirmed that okara flour could suppress the deterioration of gluten. Generally, the potato, okara, and konjac flours represent excellent fortification materials that could improve the texture, reduce water mobility, and suppress deterioration of frozen dough during storage.

AB The structure and the cation-exchange functional groups of hybrid silica materials were evaluated for the effective detoxification of hydroalcoholic solutions containing eight toxic biogenic amines (BA) usually found in fermented beverages. Results show the effectiveness of the removal is related to the number of amino functions in the extracted molecule, retention by the solid being more effective in the case of multiple amino groups, since retention is stabilized through interaction with the material surface at several points. BA with one amino function (isoamylamine, tyramine, beta-phenylethylamine), in general, showed a weak retention by the solids. For BA with more than two amine groups (spermine, spermidine), the removal rate was close to 100% for all studied materials. For histamine, cadaverine and putrescine, the removal percentages were higher with a lamellar structured sulfonic acid functionalized material and with bifunctional materials (SBA-15 type and macroporous) containing sulfonic/phosphonic acid groups obtained by co-condensation sol-gel route.

AB There was studied dough made from refined white and brown wheat flours of different granulometry by means of mechanical, thermal analysis and rheological testing. Observed results were confronted with textural properties of breads. Obtained data confirmed that fine refined white flour dough had high ability to elongate and accumulate stress, in contrary, brown fine flour dough exhibited weaker ability to accumulate stress. Observed increase of the complex viscosity associated with the gelatinization was the fastest in coarse dough, where it gained also the highest peak viscosity. The highest water content liberated was found from fine brown flour bread. This triggered lower water availability for hydration of starch granules in the bread during baking process, thus promoting higher moisture loss affecting thus the overall expansion and porosity of the bread matrix. The latter effect was ascribed to the presence of bran particles in brown flour.

AB The shelf lives of hot-air-dried (HD) and freeze-dried (FD) Penaeus vannamei were predicted by accelerated storage testing combined with Arrhenius Equation. Meanwhile, the changes in lipid profiles and colour of the dried shrimps during storage were investigated. The predicted shelf life of FD shrimp was more than 1.47-fold than that of HD shrimp. Compared to HD shrimp, FD shrimp had lower levels of oxidation parameters such as peroxide value (POV) and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances value (TBARS) during storage. In addition, FD shrimp had less reduction in lipid components such as triacylglycerol (TAG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and all fatty acids including saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) after storage. Moreover, FD shrimp showed a less significant decrease in redness value and increase in yellowness value. Therefore, FD shrimps have better quality stability during storage and then possess longer shelf life than HD shrimp.

AB The complexation of nanoparticles in extreme alkali treated (pH 10.0, 11.0 and 12.0) soy protein isolate (SPI) with 1-Octacosanol (1-Octa) was investigated. The nanoparticles were compared in complexing with the 1-Octa concerning their characteristics, along with the changes in secondary structure and stability of 1-Octa upon complexation. The nanoparticles did not display obvious changes in size and morphology upon complexation with 1-Octa, except the surface hydrophobicity. The encapsulation efficiency (EE) and loading amount (LA) of the SPI-Octa were first increased and then decreased with an enhanced pH value. The treatment conditions modified some secondary structures, causing greater protein unfolding to expose more hydrophobic clusters. Additionally, the nanocomplex had higher thermal and saline ion stability, the majority of the nanocomplexes were evenly dispersed in the aqueous phase.

AB Although refrigeration is commonly used in the storage of 'Nanguo' pears (Pyrus ussuriensis Maxim.), long-term refrigeration can result in browning of the pericarp. In this study, we aimed to determine how.-aminobutyrate (GABA) affects the mitochondrial oxidation defense system in 'Nanguo' pears and how it might be used to prevent post-refrigeration peel browning. We found that fruit treated with GABA browned slower, and had lower browning indices and reactive oxygen and malondialdehyde content; increased peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, alternating oxidase, and catalase enzyme activities; and heightened enzyme-related gene expression. The mitochondria of GABA-treated fruit also showed less damage following cold storage, and there were decreases in mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore concentrations. Furthermore, we detected an increase in the endogenous GABA content of fruits following GABA treatment. These observations indicate that, by regulating the mitochondrial oxidative defense system and maintaining mitochondrial structure, GABA is effective in terms of reducing peel browning.

AB Broad molecular weight (MW) distribution and variability of mannan to protein ratio of purified mannoproteins (MP), isolated from yeast cell walls upon the enzymatic treatment, revealed their multiplicity. The main fraction of high-MW Agrimos (R)-MP1 and YCW-b-MP1' contained mannoproteins with a mannan to protein ratio of 3.5 and 6.9, respectively. Low-MW YCW-b-MP2' was mainly comprised of mannan, with a ratio of 181, whereas low-MW Agrimos (R)-MP2 was characterized by a ratio of 12.2. The solubility of MP1/MP2 was higher than that of MP1'/MP2'. Mannoproteins showed similar or lower solubility than mannan, and they exhibited a Newtonian behaviour. Sonication was the appropriate method for the formation of mannoproteins-based emulsions. Contrary to MP1/MP1'-based emulsions, MP2/MP2'-based ones showed higher affinity towards soybean oil than glyceryl-trioleate. pH affected the emulsifying ability of MP1/MP1'. MP1/MP1' showed similar or slightly inferior emulsifying properties than lecithin. This study is expected to broaden the applications of mannoproteins as value-added ingredients.

AB Plant species differ greatly in their ability to acclimatise to and survive, cold stress. Normally, potato tubers are stored at low temperatures (below 10 degrees C) to delay sprouting. In this research, combined transcriptomic and proteomic analysis was conducted on potato tubers stored at 15 degrees C, 4 degrees C and 0 degrees C to investigate the mechanism of cold responses during postharvest storage. Results showed that soluble sugars were accumulated under low temperatures, regulating by granule-bound starch synthase 1, beta-amylase, invertase inhibitor and fructokinase. In addition, fifteen heat shock proteins (Hsps), including three Hsp70s, two Hsp80s, one Hsp90, one Hsp100 and eight small Hsps, were induced by low temperatures, which may act individually or synergistically to prevent physiological or cellular damage from cold stress in postharvest potato tubers. This research provided general information of sugar accumulation and defense response in potato tuber under cold storage.

AB This study aimed to investigate the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on membrane lipids metabolism and its relation to pulp breakdown development of longan fruit during postharvest storage. Compared to the control longans, H2O2-treated longans showed higher pulp breakdown index, cell membrane permeability, and activities of phospholipase D (PLD), lipase and lipoxygenase (LOX). Moreover, H2O2-treated longans maintained higher levels of pulp phosphatidic acid (PA) and saturated fatty acids (SFA). However, H2O2-treated longans exhibited lower levels of pulp phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylinositol (PI) and unsaturated fatty acids (USFA), lower index of unsaturated fatty acids (IUFA), and lower ratio of USFA to SFA (U/S). These findings demonstrated that H2O2 caused the increased activities of enzymes involving in membrane lipids degradation and the accelerated decompositions of membrane USFA and phospholipids in longan pulp, which eventually triggered the destruction of the pulp cell membrane structure and the development of pulp breakdown in longans during storage.

AB In this study, an electrochemical system was established to detect the branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT) activity in lactic acid bacteria (LAB). A nanocomposite of chitosan (CS) with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was synthesized, and the composite solution were uniformly spread over the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface by drop-casting to fabricate an electrochemical biosensor. The composite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cyclic voltammetry (TEM). Results indicated that the MWCNTs-CS/GCE electrode exhibited higher stability and sensitivity, compared with the GCE electrode. The linear response for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) was 1.0-9.0 mu M and the response limit was 0.12 mu M. The system effectively and sensitively detected the BCAT activity by NADH concentration in the LAB culture, comparing with the optical method. The culture condition of LAB was optimized by using this system, evidencing that established method was available to detect the BCAT activity of LAB.

AB Broccoli undergoes yellowing in unfavorable conditions, thereby diminishing the sensory quality and commodity value. This study aimed to investigate systematically cellular and/or biomolecular changes involved in broccoli yellowing by analyzing changes in microstructural integrity, pigment content, and gene expression. On day-5 of storage at 20 degrees C, the buds turned yellow without blooming and showed structural damage; ultrastructural analysis revealed plastid transformation and abnormal chloroplast development. Genes regulating pigment content and chloroplast structure directly were identified. More specifically, BoCAO and BoNYC1 regulated chlorophyll turnover, affecting chlorophyll a and b contents. Changes in the beta-cryptoxanthin content were influenced by the combined action of up-(BoHYD) and downstream (BoZEP) genes. BoZEP and BoVDE were activated after cold-temperature induction. High BoHO1 expression delayed yellowing at low temperature, inducing BoZEP expression. Color intensity correlated significantly with the chlorophyll b, beta-cryptoxanthin, and beta-carotene contents, which were associated with increased yellowing of plant tissues.

AB The aim of the present study was to evaluate Paralichthys olivaceus parvalbumin (PV) following treatment by laccase (LAC) in the presence of propyl gallate (PG) on the structure and potential allergenicity. The structure of LAC+PG treated PV was analyzed through SDS-PAGE, CD, fluorescence, and allergenicity was analyzed by immunological and cell model. Our results showed that LAC + PG treatment can induce structural changes through PV cross-linking. Western blotting and indirect ELISA analysis revealed the decrease in IgG binding capacity of PV, corresponding with the structural changes. The results of in vitro digestion illustrate that LAC + PG treated PV showed more resistance to gastrointestinal digestion compared to untreated PV. The release rate of beta-hexosaminidase and histamine decreased by 35.6% and 66.9%, respectively, with LAC + PG treatment by RBL-2H3 cell assay. Considering the wide utilization of LAC in food industry, our treatment reveals its potential for creation of hypoallergenic fish products under mild reaction conditions.

AB The microwave heating of wheat kernels, flour, and gluten, has attracted attention lately because it has been claimed to abolish gluten toxicity for celiac patients. Nevertheless, contradictory results have been reported regarding the effect on gluten celiac-immunotoxicity. In order to better understand the effect of the microwave treatment on gluten structure, conformation, functionality and celiac-immunotoxicity, a central composite design with two factors, power level, and treatment time, was used to investigate a possible quadratic and interaction effects between both factors. Extractable gliadins content was affected by the power and time in a linear and quadratic fashion; extractable glutenins were not affected. Gluten secondary structure was affected by the microwave treatment and related to the polymer's disaggregation phenomenon observed. In fact, the microwave treatment increased the amount of potentially toxic epitopes released after peptic and tryptic digestion, showing inefficiency as a treatment to detoxify the gluten for celiac disease patients.

AB The formation of toxic and potentially carcinogenic acrylamide, alongside volatile aroma compounds, was studied after polyphenols ((+)-catechin, quercetin, gallic, ferulic, caffeic acids) were added to model bread. The addition of as little as 0.1% polyphenols to bread significantly reduced acrylamide (16.2-95.2%). In the case of quercetin, a promoting effect was observed (+9.8%) when its concentration increased. Of all the phenolic compounds, regardless of concentration, ferulic acid showed the highest level of acrylamide inhibition. This is probably due to the presence of 4-vinylguaiacol, a degradation derivative with strong antioxidant activity in heterogeneous systems. Although the phenolic compounds mitigate acrylamide, this adversely affected bread volatile profile. At the highest level (2.0%), caffeic acid most significantly suppressed Maillard-type volatiles (75.9%), followed by gallic acid (74.3%), ferulic acid (65.6%), (+)-catechin (62.4%), and quercetin (59.3%). Among polyphenols, ferulic acid decreased yeast fermentation products level the most (33.1%), simultaneously enhancing lipid oxidation product, probably due to inhibition of amylases and yeast activity.

AB The effect of cropping system (conventional vs. organic) and soil tillage (conventional vs. reduced tillage) on the health potential of durum wheat grain as well as on semolina and pasta quality traits was investigated in a long-term field experiment. Total antioxidant capacity, total arabinoxylans, alkylresorcinols, yellow pigments and total phenolics, which were assessed in kernels, revealed differences between the two cultivation systems only in 2011, whereas in the 2010 rainy season, cropping management did not influence these compounds. Proteins and W index were higher in the conventional system, except for the exceptionally rainy years. In contrast, the quality of cooked spaghetti was comparable in both management systems. Soil tillage differently affected bioactive compounds but had no impact on semolina and pasta quality. Overall, climatic conditions was the major factor affecting the quality of durum wheat. Our results indicate that an organic system does not represent a constraint to obtaining durum wheat grain with healthy potential relative to conventional wheat.

AB Lactoferrin (LF) is a glycoprotein that serves as a potential vehicle for small bioactive molecules in food. In an effort to improve this functionality, the kinetic and thermodynamic interaction of LF with naringin (NR) was studied by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The results demonstrated that the association rate constant between LF and NR was 5.00 x 10(4) M-1 s(-1), while the dissociation rate of the complex was 0.36 s(-1), at 25 degrees C. The stable complex predominated over free molecules (Delta G(25 degrees C)(0) = -29.35 kJ mol(-1)), and the binding constant was 1.39 x 10 (5) M-1, at 25 degrees C. The association of LF and NR to form an intermediate complex occurred in multi-steps. Nevertheless, the intermediate complex formation from the dissociation of the stable complex occurred in a single step with the activation energy independent of temperature. This study provides an important basis to explore LF as a vehicle for bioactive molecules.

AB The effect of a hydroxyl radical generating system (HRGS), which contained FeCl3, sodium ascorbate, and different concentrations of H2O2, on the physiochemical properties of myofibrillar protein (MP) from squid mantles, has been investigated. The effect of different exposure times to HRGS was also considered. Compared to non-oxidized MP, a significant (p < 0.05) increase in carbonyl content (more than 50% of its original content) and protein solubility, as well as in surface hydrophobicity, was observed in the oxidative MP. With different treatment times, a sharp decrease (p < 0.05) in sulfhydryl content was detected. In addition, hydroxyl radical treatment significantly reduced the MP gel's texture properties, whiteness and water holding capacity, especially at higher concentrations of H2O2. This observation could be attributed to extensive disorderly and less compact structure of MP gels. The results demonstrate the negative effect of HRGS on the structural and functional properties of MP from squid mantles.

AB This study determined the effects of phenolic extracts from grape pomace and sorghum bran, reaction time and washing with aqueous ethanol on the pasting, flow, thermal and molecular properties of maize starch. The starch modification was carried out under alkaline conditions. The phenolic extracts increased the peak viscosity of the starch. Reaction time had no significant effect on starch properties. Washing with aqueous ethanol significantly increased the peak, final, and setback viscosities of the phenolic modified maize starches. DSC of phenolic modified starches showed higher enthalpy (Delta H) before and after washing with aqueous ethanol in comparison with starch without phenolic extract. FTIR spectra suggested the possible formation of hydrogen and ether (covalent) bonds between starch and phenolic compounds. It can be concluded that the pasting, flow and thermal properties of maize starch can be modified with phenolic extract under alkaline conditions to produce "clean label" starch-phenolic complex.

AB Authentication of ground coffee has become an important issue because of fraudulent activities in the sector. In the current work, sixty-seven Brazilian coffees produced in different geographical origins using organic (ORG, n=25) and conventional (CONV, n=42) systems were analyzed for their stable isotope ratios (delta C-13, delta O-18, delta H-2, and delta N-15). Data were analyzed by inferential analysis to compare the factors whereas linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and support vector machines (SVM) were used to classify the coffees based on their origin. ORG and CONV cultivated coffees could not be differentiated according to C stable isotope ratio (delta C-13; p=0.204), but ORG coffees presented higher values of the N stable isotope ratio (delta N-15; p=0.0006). k-NN presented the best classification results for both ORG and CONV coffees (87% and 67%, respectively). SVM correctly classified coffees produced in Sao Paulo (75% accuracy), while LDA correctly classified 71% of coffees produced in Minas Gerais.

AB Rice is the most consumed food worldwide, therefore its designation of origin (PDO) is very useful. Laserinduced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is an interesting analytical technique for PDO certification, since it provides fast multielemental analysis requiring minimal sample treatment. In this work LIBS spectral data from rice analysis were evaluated for PDO certification of Argentine brown rice. Samples from two PDOs were analyzed by LIBS coupled to spark discharge. The selection of spectral data was accomplished by extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), an algorithm currently used in machine learning, but rarely applied in chemical issues. Emission lines of C, Ca, Fe, Mg and Na were selected, and the best performance of classification were obtained using k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm. The developed method provided 84% of accuracy, 100% of sensitivity and 78% of specificity in classification of test samples. Furthermore, it is simple, clean and can be easily applied for rice certification.

AB Use of banana flours as functional ingredients is growing due to their nutritional benefits derived from phenolics and dietary fiber. However, the effect oven-drying, freeze-drying and extrusion on the phenolic compounds or starch digestibility is not understood. In this work, phenolic acids (gallic acid, caffeic acid), flavan-3-ols (epicatechin, catechin) and flavonols (quercetin-3-O-glucoside and myricetin) were quantified in banana flour processed by different methods. Epicatechin, the most abundant phenolic in all flours (up to 1.93 mg/100 g), was significantly reduced during thermal processing (oven-drying and extrusion). Meanwhile, phenolic acids and flavonols were found to be more thermally stable. Thus, oven-drying and extrusion generally improved the extractability of phenolic acids and flavonols. Freeze-drying resulted in native flours with significantly higher insoluble dietary fiber (up to 43.3%), although the digestible starch fraction was digested more rapidly than the oven-dried counterpart.

AB A novel signal-on portable sensing system has been developed for OTA detection using personal glucose meter (PGM) as signal transducer. In the study, we explore the potential of using a short dsDNA as template to trigger the "click" ligation of two DNA strands, further improve the stability of DNA strand on the magnetic beads (MBs) surface, and thereby reduce the background signal. Compared with no "click" ligation, the background signal decreases 7.5 times. Both the sensitivity and selectivity are greatly promoted. A high sensitivity with OTA detection down to 72 pg/mL is achieved, which is comparable with several existing detectors, such as fluorescence-based detectors and electrochemical detectors. The feasibility of the strategy in real samples is well verified and evaluated by detecting OTA in feed samples, indicating the potential application in the food safety field.

AB In this study, the effects of ultrasonic intensity on conformational changes in aqueous citrus pectin solution under ultrasonic processing and its possible transition mechanism were investigated. The results demonstrated that higher ultrasonic intensity (104.7 W/cm(2)) caused larger alterations in the molecular and conformational parameters of the semiflexible pectin (Mark-Houwink relation exponent a: 0.820, conformational parameter a: 0.607, structural parameter.: 2.22) in aqueous solution. Meanwhile, the semiflexible chain of pectin became more flexible (a: 0.804, a: 0.601,.: 1.75) at higher ultrasonic intensity in aqueous solution, as was verified by atomic force microscopy. Moreover, conformational changes in pectin from semiflexible chains to flexible chains or even flexible coils (a: 0.791, a: 0.597,.: 1.70) could be attributed to the decreased degree of methoxylation and neutral sugars in side chains and the destruction of inter-and intramolecular hydrogen bonds under ultrasonic processing. Therefore, these results have important implications for understanding the ultrasonic modification of pectin.

AB An anti-idiotypic nanobody-phage display-mediated immuno-polymerase chain reaction (PD-IPCR) method was developed for simultaneous quantitative detection of total aflatoxins and zearalenone in cereals. Two phages, displaying the variable domain of the heavy chain anti-idiotypic nanobody that binds aflatoxin-or zearalenone-specific monoclonal antibody (1C11 or 2D3), were used as competitors for corresponding analytes. Specific DNA sequences encoding anti-idiotypic nanobodies were used to design the primers for PCR amplification. The results indicated that detection limits for total aflatoxins and zearalenone in a sample were 0.03 and 0.09 ng mL(-1), respectively. Recoveries of spiked aflatoxins and zearalenone were 80-118% and 76.7-111%, respectively. Validation results were in good agreement with the gold-standard high-performance liquid chromatography method. This report is the first to describe PD-IPCR for simultaneous quantitative detection of total aflatoxins and zearalenone in cereals.

AB Compositional difference in infant formula (IF) tends to influence its functionality and storage behaviour. The aim was to study the composition and physico-chemical properties of different stages of two commercial IF (A and B). Lactose crystallization measured by X-ray diffraction ranged between 2 and 32 % and was observed to decrease with increasing IF stages, which directly correlates with their composition. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the presence of crystalline lactose which significantly (p < 0.05) increased the powder particle size. On the contrary, a negative correlation was observed between surface fat and lactose crystallization in all samples. Bulk and surface-free fat composition was significantly (p < 0.05) different for all samples. Surface free-fat analysis showed restricted presence (5-10% of surface fat) of unsaturated fatty acids (C18:1 and C18:2) in IF with higher crystalline lactose as opposed to > 40% in others, suggesting a possible role of lactose crystallization in preferential migration of triglycerides to particle surface.

AB Here, we present the proteome profiling of low-molecular weight (< 50 kDa) proteins of seven different lentil cultivars developed by Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute. A total of 2873 peptides corresponding to 180 unique proteins were identified wherein> 24% of them were described lentil allergens. Comparative relative quantitation showed differences in protein abundance of major allergen proteins such as Len c 1.0101, Len c 1.0102, and lipid transfer proteins (LTPs), indicating qualitative and quantitative variations in allergen proteins in lentil cultivars. In this report, for the first-time, the amino acid sequence of LTPs in lentil has been confirmed by high resolution mass spectrometry. In addition, ideal peptides of Len c 1.0101, Len c 1.0102, and LTPs allergens were further determined with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) analysis. Therefore, this data could provide a great resource for further development of targeted, proteomics-based assays for quantification of lentil allergens.

AB Oak honeydew and chestnut honeys often share the same production area in Atlantic landscapes. Consequently these honeys have common physicochemical properties and pollen composition, making their differentiation by routine methods, a difficult task. The increase in the demands of consumers for clear honey labelling, identifying floral make-ups and the substantial health properties of both honey types, make it necessary to improve methods to differentiate the honeys. Statistical multivariate techniques were used to study the differences in the physicochemical composition and pollen spectra between chestnut honey and oak honeydew honey. Palynological analysis, moisture, pH, electrical conductivity, hydroxymethylfurfural, diastase number, colour, phenolic content, minerals and sugars were used for this purpose. The variables that had more weight in the differentiation by principal component analysis were Castanea, Cytisus type, CIELab coordinates (a* and L), RSA, Mg and trehalose; 97.6% of the honey samples were correctly classified by linear discriminant analysis.

AB Low temperatures retard postharvest ripening and prolong the supply period of 'Nanguo' pears. However, quality deterioration, or more specifically, a faded aroma occurs in long-term cold-stored fruits. To understand the implicit mechanism, we analyzed the change in content of the main aroma esters and fatty acids by chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the expression patterns of the main genes in fatty acid metabolism pathways. The results showed that hexyl hexanoate disappeared completely and the content of five other aromas declined significantly in cold-stored fruit during the optimal taste period. The content of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids significantly increased and decreased, respectively in cold-stored fruit. fadD, fadE, fadJ, atoB, fabF, SCD, FAD2, LOX2S, LOX1_5 and HPL genes down-regulated in fatty acid metabolism during shelf life in the fruit after cold storage. In conclusion, the faded aroma of cold-stored fruit was mainly regulated by fatty acid metabolism pathway.

AB The intensive use of pesticides has led to the need to optimize analytical methodologies for the control of residues in food. The present study aims to compare the efficiency of different ion sources (Eletrospray Ionization-ESI and Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization - APCI) in LC-MS/MS systems, when analysing 22 pesticides in a cabbage matrix. The method performance was evaluated during a validation study. Organophosphates, triazoles, pyrethroids and triazines compounds showed good linearity in the range 0.5-200 mu g.Kg(-1). Statistical tests were used to evaluate linearity. LOQm values varied from 0.50 to 1.0 mu g.Kg(-1) to the ESI source, and 1.0-2.0 mu g.Kg(-1) for the APCI source. Matrix effect was more intense when using the APCI source. Accuracy and precision were evaluated at three levels of concentration (2; 20 and 100 mu gKg(-1)). Most of the compounds presented recovery between 70 and 120%. ESI-LC-MS/MS system showed greater efficiency in multiresidue analysis in the cabbage matrix.

AB Almond shell, a by-product obtained from the nut industry, was valorised into low degree of polymerisation xylooligosaccharides using alkaline pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. The effect of particle size on hemicellulose recovery upon pretreatment was studied using 1 and 2 M NaOH. It was observed that particle size significantly influences hemicellulose recovery, as particles below 120 mu m resulted in near complete recovery at 2 M NaOH. Enzymatic hydrolysis of hemicellulose was optimised using response surface methodology, to obtain efficient xylooligosaccharides production at low enzyme dose and high substrate concentration. For higher XOS yield, an enzyme dose of 10 U and substrate concentration < 2% was optimal. The in-vitro human faecal fermentation study revealed no significant difference in gas and short chain fatty acid level among substrates evaluated. It was observed that short chain oligosaccharides produce higher level of acetate than medium chain oligosaccharides.

AB Anthocyanins and anthocyanidins are polyphenolic compounds, responsible for the red and blue colours in several fruits, flowers, and leaves. Their colorant properties, bioavailability and antioxidant activity, made anthocyanins and anthocyanidins largely adopted in food and pharmaceutical industries. In this body of work, we firstly introduced structure, photophysical properties, co-pigmentation, antioxidant properties, glycosylation and complexation of anthocyanins and anthocyanidins. Secondly, we reported the computational methods adopted and the main theoretical results involving either anthocyanins and anthocyanidins, ranging from the first theoretical investigation on the structure of flavylium ions to the most recent studies on anthocyanins adsorbed on TiO2. We reviewed the computational contributions to the description of molecular properties of anthocyanins and anthocyanidins, giving a particular attention to the geometries, the spectroscopic features and the complexation properties of such molecules. Nowadays, theoretical calculations represent an essential methodology to understand and predict the chemical and physical properties of anthocyanins and their derivates.

AB Volatile sulfur-containing compounds (VSCs) often exist at extremely low concentrations, making them difficult to be determined. The VSCs in Laobaigan (LBG) Baijiu were analyzed by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with GCxGC-SCD, by which 12 VSCs were identified. Among the 65 odor-active compounds that were determined by GC-O with the aid of aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA), benzenemethanethiol and 2-methyl-3-furanthiol were found to possess the highest FD values of 6561. The limits of detection (LODs) of the identified VSCs determined by GCxGC-SCD were found to be extremely low at 0.05-1.53 ng/L, with their analytical recoveries from 85% to 116%. The VSCs in the LBG samples were determined in a range of concentrations from 0.77 +/- 0.02 mu g/L to 60.04 +/- 2.32 mu g/L. Benzenemethanethiol, dimethyl trisulfide, 2-methyl-3-furanthiol and 2-furfurylthiol exhibited odor activity values (OAVs) > 100 and significantly contributed to the overall aroma of LBG Baijiu.

AB Agaricus blazei, Auricularia fuscosuccinea and Pleurotus albidus mycelia were obtained in solid-state cultivation (SSC), using grains (brown rice, canjica corn and wheat) as raw material. Colonized grain flours were analysed for their nutritional, physical and physico-chemical characteristics and biological activity in vitro. Wheat flour with P. albidus showed higher values for protein (18.34 g/100 g), ergosterol (0.60 mg/g), mycelial biomass (183 mg/g) and total amino acids (58.34 mg/g). Corn flour with A. fuscosuccinea showed the highest total phenolic content (2.38 mg GAE/g), antioxidant activity in the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (8.90 mu mol TEAC/g) and 2,2'-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) (16.52 mu mol TEAC/g) assay. Wheat flour with P. albidus were more effective at inhibiting of pancreatic lipase (74.5%) and of a-glucosidase (98.2%). In conclusion, grains colonized by macrofungi mycelia through SSC can enrich the nutritional value and the biological activity of the flours, which presents a potential for functional foods.

AB The formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) may affect life quality and cut lifespan. With the increasingly utilization of new foods and booming development of international trade, large amounts of newly emerging teas have come into our sight. In this study, we evaluated the antiglycative capabilities of five popular herbal teas. Results showed that Chinese Hong Dou Shan (Taxus chinensis; HDS) leaf tea had particularly strong antiglycative activity via scavenging methylglyoxal (MGO) in both chemical (glucose-BSA, fructose-BSA, and MGO-BSA) and cell models (HUVECs). Furthermore, the intracellular AGEs level was alleviated to normal state by the two HDS leaf tea fractions, H-47 and H-57 which were almost as effective as EGCG when added at the same level (50 mu g/mL). The effective components against glycation were further separated and tentatively identified as catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin, epigallocatechin, procyanidin B-2, a dihydromyricetin dimer, and a quercetin glucoside by HPLC-DAD and LC-Q-TOF/MS analysis.

AB The present study investigated the effects of proteins, lipids and beta-glucan in naked oat flour (NOF) on the in vitro digestibility of starch. The content of rapidly digested starch (RDS) increased, and the content of resistant starch (RS) decreased in NOF after removing the non-starch constituents. The estimated glycemic index (eGI) of starch in NOF increased after the removal of the non-starch constituents, with a decreasing order of naked oat starch (NOS) > de-beta-glucan flour > de-proteins flour > de-lipids flour > NOF. NOS was found to have an A-type crystalline pattern, but the removal of proteins or beta-glucan rendered NOS a V-type crystalline pattern. The relative crystallinity decreased after removing non-starch constituents. The in vitro digestibility was positively correlated with the short-range molecular order and negatively correlated with the relative crystallinity. These results clearly illustrate the effects of non-starch constituents on the low digestibility of naked oat.

AB Fructooligosaccharides have important potential use in the food industry due to their properties such as solubility in water, stability in acidity of fruit juices and during storage, low-calorie value and prebiotic effects. In this study, for the first time, Zymomonas mobilis levansucrase was used for in situ 6-kestose production in carob molasses. The produced kestose was stable during storage at 20 degrees C for 4 months. The product was evaluated for color, non-enzymatic browning index and titratable acidity during storage and the quality of the product was found comparable to that of control. Furthermore, the decreased amount of sucrose resulted in the prevention of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) formation during storage. As a result, carob molasses was converted into a high-quality prebiotic product with decreased sucrose content and reduced 5-HMF quantities, and a new method was developed to prevent 5-HMF formation in fruit juices and molasses.

AB Milk fat is arguably one of the most complex fats found in nature and varies widely between animal species. Analysis of its digestion products is tremendously challenging, due to the complexity, diversity, and large range of concentrations of triacylglycerols (TAGs) and their digestion products (i.e. diacylglycerols (DAGs), monoacylglycerols (MAGs), and free fatty acids (FFAs)). Therefore, a method combined the solid phase extraction (SPE), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and multi-dimension mass spectrometry (MDMS) was developed to identify and semi-quantify the TAGs, DAGs and MAGs in milk fat after in vitro digestion. Up to 105, 64, 14 and 30 species of TAGs, DAGs, MAGs, and FFAs were determined with their concentrations of 0.01-22.3, 0.01-39.2, 0.01-47.8, and 0.04-191.0 mg/g fat, respectively, during the in vitro digestion of cow and sheep milk. The validation of the method shows that this method was precise and reliable.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the effect of boiling seeds of three cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) varieties on nutrient ileal and total tract digestibilities in rats and in vitro hindgut production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Boiling influenced nutrient ileal and total tract digestibilities, and production of SCFAs (P < 0.05), but its effect was in general cowpea specific. For instance, boiling increased the apparent ileal proline digestibility of red-hulls cowpea only (P < 0.05), while it only increased the apparent total tract cellulose digestibility of pink-hulls cowpea (P < 0.05). White-hulls cowpea had in general higher nutrient apparent ileal and total tract digestibilities (P < 0.05). For instance, white-hulls cowpea had greater (+ 2.6% units) apparent total tract dry matter digestibility than pink-and red-hulls cowpeas (P < 0.05). In conclusion, boiling influenced several parameters relate to the nutritional value of the cowpeas, but its effect was specific for each cowpea variety. White-hull cowpea had the highest nutritional value.

AB Physical, chemical and thermal properties, as well as molecular structure of cassava-based resistant dextrins prepared under different dextrinization conditions (0.04-0.10% HCl, 100-120 degrees C, 60-180 min) were determined. Increasing acid concentration, temperature and heating time resulted in the products with darker color, higher solubility, reducing sugar content, total dietary fiber and proportion of high molecular weight fiber fraction. An endothermic peak at 45-70 degrees C, having enthalpy of 1.66-2.14 J/g, was found from the samples processed under mild conditions (0.04-0.08% HCl, 100 degrees C, 60 min). However, harsher dextrinization conditions eliminated this endotherm. Dextrinization led to 1000-fold decrease in weight-average molecular weight (M-w) of the products, comparing to the native starch. Stronger processing conditions yielded the resistant dextrins with slightly higher M-w but composing of shorter branched chains. During dextrinization, hydrolysis was a predominant step, while transglucosidation and repolymerization played key roles in modifying molecular structure and properties, especially dietary fiber content, of resistant dextrins.

AB Improving the extraction efficiency and stability of red beet compounds has gained the attention of researchers due to their high nutritional and health benefits. In this study, beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) enhanced ultrasound assisted extraction was used for the extraction of red beet extract, and lyophilized extracts were characterized with FTIR and DSC analyses. The samples extracted with aqueous 5% beta-CD solutions revealed the highest content of betanin (2.243 +/- 0.04 mg) and total phenolic compounds (20.03 +/- 1.28 mg GAE/g DW), and the highest DPPH inhibition activity (59.87 +/- 4.94%). Additionally, complexation with beta-CD significantly enhanced the stability of betanin, phenolic compounds and antiradical activity in the stored beverage and gummy candy models at various pH and temperature conditions during 28 days. In conclusion, beta-CD-enhanced ultrasound assisted extraction is a suitable approach to extracting and stabilizing the red beet compounds for application in food, nutraceutical, and medical fields.

AB The aim of this study was to dissociate the effect of atomization from that of heating during the spray-drying of Low Methoxyl (LM) pectin/sodium caseinate complexes. The properties of these complexes were studied by measuring turbidity, particle size distribution, zeta-potential, as well as surface hydrophobicity of caseinate within the formed complexes. The results showed that the spraying step had a significant effect on the charge and the size of the complexes. In fact, the application of atomization resulted in the dissociation of caseinate/ pectin aggregates especially for high pectin concentrations. Besides, the analysis of the surface hydrophobicity of caseinate indicated that complexation with high concentrations of pectin is able to protect the structure of the protein against heat denaturation. This study allowed a better understanding of the influence of atomization and heat treatment (during the dehydration step) on the molecular interactions within caseinate/pectin complexes.

AB Ferrocene-based nanoporous organic polymer (Fc-NOP) was used as solid-phase extraction (SPE) adsorbent and showed excellent adsorption capacity for chlorophenols (CPs) compared with commercial C18 and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Then, a SPE method with Fc-NOP packed cartridge combined with HPLC-UV detection was developed to determine CPs in tap water, black tea drinks and peach juice samples. Under optimal conditions, the detection limits of the method measured at the signal to noise ratio of 3 (S/N = 3) were 0.04-0.06 ng mL(-1) for tap water and 0.10-0.20 ng mL(-1) for black tea drinks and peach juice samples. Satisfactory method recoveries were achieved in the range of 87.6-119% with relative standard deviations of 3.11-7.83%. Result proved that this method was a sensitive and efficient method for determination of trace CPs in foods. The extraction result for more other compounds confirmed that the developed method had a great application potential for analysis of other trace pollutants in food samples.

AB Rice glutelin (RG) and phosphorylated rice glutelin (PPRG) were treated with heating for different time (15, 30, and 45 min), the effects of phosphorylation modification on the structure, interactions and rheological properties of rice glutelin during heat treatment were investigated. The results showed that the turbidity of PPRG samples were higher than those of RG samples after heating. Particle size distribution showed that the protein aggregates with particle size of 1000-1500 nm were formed after heating for 45 min. Changes in protein structure indicated that the protein unfolded after heating for a short time, and aggregated when heating time extended to 45 min. In addition, the microstructure of PPRG sample became tight when heated for 45 min. Rheological analysis showed that phosphorylation modification and heat treatment improved RG viscoelasticity. These results suggest that phosphorylation modification improves thermal aggregation of RG, which will facilitate the application of RG in food industry.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Enzyme hydrolysis of corn gluten meal (CGM) is a promising process to prepare oligopeptides with high Fischer ratios (HFOPs). However, the relationship between Fischer ratios and enzyme hydrolysis approaches remains poorly understood. In this study, peptidomes of varying corn protein hydrolysates (CPHs) before and after activated carbon adsorption were profiled and analyzed according to sequence composition and chain length. Fischer ratios of HFOPs depended on sequences in CPHs by differing enzyme hydrolysis approaches, especially branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)-aromatic amino acid (AAA)-containing-oligopeptides. Activated carbon adsorption increased BCAA-containing-oligopeptide contents and decreased oligopeptide contents including AAAs, preferring BCAA-AAA-containing-oligopeptides with long chain length. Employing a three-enzyme hydrolysis approach, HFOPs were obtained with a yield of 49%, comprising 90% of dipeptides and tripeptides and possessing additional bioactivities. This work revealed the mechanism of HFOP production depending on the release and selective removal of oligopeptides and confirmed CGM was a promising alternative for value-added HFOP production.

AB Leaves of plants from the genus Camellia (CAM) are used to make tea; however, there are limited data that compares chemical composition and biological activity of CAM cultivars used to make six tea types. Fourteen CAM cultivars were analyzed by HPLC and UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS and biological activity was assessed in a cell growth assay. Tea bioactives and cell growth inhibition varied 2-4 fold. EGCG was the dominant catechin that predicted the magnitude of growth inhibition. However, pure EGCG did not fully account for inhibitory activity suggesting that it may serve as a chemical marker for bioefficacy. As an unbiased characterization of differences in chemical composition among CAM, individual metabolomes were determined and used to generate principle components (PC). PC's from the metabolome were complementary to those from targeted analyses of tea bioactives and were predictive of growth inhibition. This study provides a frame work for identifying CAM cultivars with beneficial traits.

AB Red wines injected with nitrogen or oxygen during fermentation were used to identify the effect of gas exposure on tannin structure and reactivity with poly-L-proline. Tannin was purified from wine after fermentation and after three years of bottle storage. Tannin from nitrogen-treated wine had a lower percentage of galloylation and were less pigmented than tannin from oxygen-exposed wine. Self-aggregation of tannin was measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis and a larger particle size was observed for the oxidized treatment. The interaction of tannin and poly-L-proline was measured by isothermal titration calorimetry, and involved more hydrogen bonding than hydrophobic interactions in the case of nitrogen-treated wine tannin. Conversely, oxidized tannin was more hydrophobic and the association with poly-L-proline was entropy-driven due to a change of solvation. The results show meaningful changes in the structure and reactivity of tannin as a result of oxygen exposure during fermentation, which may impact astringency perception.

AB A red colored caffeic acid trimer was synthesized in model solution by enzymatic oxidation. The structure was elucidated by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy and consisted of four carbon rings and two unsaturated acyl side chains. A formation pathway is suggested which includes the formation of a caffeic acid ortho-quinone followed by a Michael-type reaction, and radical coupling of a semiquinone of the formed dimer and a third caffeic acid molecule. The final structure is formed by decarboxylation and cyclisation. Results of ESI-MSn analysis can be explained by the presence of two carboxylic acid groups and a tetracyclic structure. The relative configuration of the central chiral carbons was deduced by NOESY experiments.

AB A novel electrochemical sensor was developed combination molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) with nanowell technology, and which was utilized for sensitive and selective 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta-E-2) detection. A nanowell gold film with a thickness of 120 nm and a pore size of similar to 20 nm was immobilized onto gold electrode surface to form a nanowell-based electrode. MIPs was then synthesized onto the nanowell-based electrode using electro-polymerization method, and then the nanowell-based MIP electrochemical sensor was formed. This sensor surface exhibited 3D-nanowell structure with higher surface area and enhanced electron-transport ability, while MIPs afford stronger recognition capability with higher selectivity and specificity. Most importantly, the developed sensor was validated for 17 ss-E-2 detection in food samples with larger detection range from 1x10(-12) to 1x10(-5) and lower detection limit of 1x10(-13). Therefore, such nanowell-based MIP electrochemical sensor may be a promising candidate electrochemical sensor for trace pollution detection in food samples.

AB Choline chloride-based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) were used as green alternatives to conventional organic solvents for extracting valuable flavonoids from citrus peel waste. The effects of viscosity, pH, and polarity of DESs on the extraction efficiency were investigated. Results revealed linear dependence of extraction yield of citrus flavonoids on the polarity of the hydrogen bond donor (HBD). To simultaneously and effectively extract polymethoxylated flavonoids (PMFs) and glycosides of flavonoids (GoFs) with different polarities, five ternary DESs were designed and prepared by combining the effective HBD components. Among the tailor-made DESs studied, choline chloride-levulinic acid-N-methyl urea showed the highest extraction yield of total flavonoids. Under optimized extraction conditions, 18.75 mg/g PMFs and 47.07 mg/g GoFs were extracted from citrus peel with recoveries of 95.87% and 86.32%, respectively. This study presents a useful strategy based on tailor-made DESs to selectively extracted value-added flavonoids from waste peels in the citrus-processing industry.

AB Multiwalled carbon nanotubes molybdenum disulfide 3D nanocomposite (MWCNT-MoS2 NC) was successfully synthesized via eco-friendly hydrothermal method. The microstructural characterization of synthesized nanocomposite was carried out using different spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. Nanocomposite was activated using glutaraldehyde chemistry and used as a platform to immobilize Lens culinaris ss-galactosidase (Lsbgal) which resulted in 93% of immobilization efficiency. Attachment of Lsbgal onto nanocomposite was confirmed by AFM, FE-SEM, FTIR, and CLSM. The nanobiocatalyst showed broadening in operational pH and temperature working range. Remarkable increase in thermal stability was observed as compared to soluble enzyme. Nanobiocatalyst showed outstanding increase in storage stability, retained 92% of residual activity over a period of 8 months. This offers good reusability as it retained similar to 50% residual activity up to 21 reuses and exhibited higher rate of lactose hydrolysis in whey. MWCNT-MoS2 NC conjugated to biomolecules can serve as a potential platform for fabrication of lactose biosensor.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the formation of tryptophan derivatives in the kynurenine pathway during wort fermentation using a multi-response kinetic model and an empirical modified logistic model. Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCYC 88 (ale yeast) and S. pastorianus NCYC 203 (lager yeast) were used to understand the effect of fermentation type on tryptophan derivatives. According to the modified logistic model, tryptophan concentration was critical for the maximum production rate of kynurenic acid, a neuroprotective compound. The results indicated that utilization of tryptophan and kynurenic acid formation were faster in wort fermented with S. cerevisiae than with S. pastorianus. The reaction rate constants implied that the kynurenic acid formation stage was minor compared to other enzymatic reactions leading to NAD(+) synthesis. Multi-response kinetic modeling of kynurenine pathway provided insights into tryptophan derivative formation, which can facilitate improved beer fermentation processing.

AB Polyphenols can inhibit the enzymatic browning in food, but their indistinct synergistic effect and conformational change have limited their applications. In this paper, the mixture of quercetin, cinnamic acid and ferulic acid (Group 11, K-I= 0.239 mM) possessed a higher inhibition ability than quercetin (K-I= 0.361 mM), which could promote the spontaneous binding process. The final Group 11-tyrosinase complex is more stable, and the hydrophobic effect is the major driving force during the binding process. Moreover, there is not a direct relationship between the destruction of secondary structures and catalytic activity of tyrosinase. The interaction between ferulic acid and tyrosinase could destroy the secondary structures of enzyme but it had little impact on the tyrosinase activity. Molecular docking suggested that three polyphenols from Group 11 have synergistic effect on tyrosinase. This study provides new perspectives about the development of tyrosinase inhibitors in food products.

AB To improve the industrial application of wheat bran insoluble dietary fiber (W-IDF), three modification methods (carboxymethylation, complex enzymatic hydrolysis, and ultrafine comminution) were compared on the basis of structural, physicochemical, functional, and antioxidant properties of W-IDF. FT-IR, DSC and SEM analysis showed that modifications contributed to alteration in morphology and arrangement of chemical bonds in WIDF. Carboxymethylation effectively improved the water retention (WRC), water swelling (WSC), and glucose adsorption capacities (GAC); complex enzymatic hydrolysis greatly improved the oil retention (ORC), GAC, and nitrite ion adsorption capacities (NIAC). Although ultrafine comminution reduced the WRC and ORC, while positively influenced the GAC and NIAC. Moreover, total phenol content, total antioxidant capacity, DPPH radical scavenging capacity, Fe2+ chelating capacity and total reducing power were improved in modified W-IDF. Our results confirmed that carboxymethylation can improve the nutritive quality and sensory properties of WIDF (nutritive ingredient) in food products.

AB This study investigated discrimination and prediction of ochratoxin A (OTA) in three Aspergillus carbonarius strains cultured grape-based medium using E-nose technology and GC-MS analysis. Results showed that these strains cultured medium samples were divided into four groups regarding their log 10 OTA value using an equispaced normal distribution analysis. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) revealed that GC-MS PLS-DA model only separated the low OTA level medium samples from the rest OTA level samples, whereas all the OTA level samples were segregated from each other using E-nose PLS-DA model. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis indicated that an excellent prediction performance was established on the accumulation of OTA in these medium samples using E-nose PLSR, whereas GC-MS PLSR model showed a screening performance on the OTA formation. These indicated that E-nose analysis could be a reliable method on discriminating and predicting OTA in A. carbonarius strains under grape-based medium.

AB To obtain better understanding of the formation mechanisms of bitterness and adhesiveness, protease activities, proteolysis index and protein degradation were investigated among raw, normal and defective hams. Normal and defective hams both showed a decrease in cathepsin B and B+L activities compared with raw ham, while higher residual activities were observed in defective ham. Approximate 1.2-fold values of proteolysis index were observed in defective ham than in normal ham, indicating that cathepsin B and B+L activities were key contributors in degrading muscle proteins of dry-cured ham. 322 proteins were identified by label-free proteomics, and 49 down-regulated proteins were found in the comparison between normal and defective hams. Creatine kinase, myosin, a-actinin and troponin-T showed the most intense response to bitterness and adhesiveness of dry-cured ham, confirmed by partial least squares regression analysis. Myosin could be a suitable biomarker to monitor bitterness and adhesiveness of dry-cured ham.

AB The analysis of free fatty acids (FFAs) in edible oils can provide important information for quality control and oil authentication. Herein, we report the comprehensive profiling of FFAs in edible oils via magnetic dispersive extraction combined with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCxGC-MS). A magnetic extractant was designed for dispersive extraction of FFAs. The extraction conditions were carefully optimized. To assess the extraction method, we first use the method for analysis of 7 targeted FFAs. The limits of detection range from 5.6 to 25.8 ng g(-1), and the recoveries in oil samples are 81%-107%. We then performed comprehensive profiling of untargeted FFAs in oil by combining the extraction method with GCxGC-MS. A total of 64 FFAs were identified positively or putatively. The proposed method can provide FFA fingerprint data to guide the processing, storage and authentication of edible oils.

AB A class imbalance problem occurs when a particular class of data is significantly more or less than another class of data. This problem is difficult to solve; however, solutions such as the oversampling method using synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) or conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) have been suggested recently to solve this problem. In the case of SMOTE and their variations, it is possible to generate biased artificial data because it does not consider the entire data in the minority class. To overcome this problem, an oversampling method using cGAN has been proposed. However, such a method does not consider the majority class that affects the classification boundary. In particular, if there is an outlier in the majority class, the classification boundary may be biased. This paper presents an oversampling method using outlier detectable generative adversarial network (OD-GAN) to solve this problem. We use a discriminator, which is used only for training purposes in cGAN, as an outlier detector to quantify the difference between the distributions of the majority and minority classes. The discriminator can detect and remove outliers. This prevents the distortion of the classification boundary caused by outliers. The generator imitates the distribution of the minority class and generates artificial data to balance the dataset. We experiment with various datasets, oversampling techniques, and classifiers. The empirical results show that the performance of OD-GAN is better than those of other oversampling methods for imbalanced datasets with outliers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The probabilistic collaborative representation-based classification (PCRC), as a novel extension of collaborative representation-based classification (CRC), is a promising method in pattern recognition. In this article, we adopt the coarse to fine representation to propose two-phase probabilistic collaborative representation based-classification (TPCRC) to enhance the power of pattern discrimination in PCRC. In TPCRC, the first phase is to utilize probabilistic collaborative representation to coarsely choose the nearest representative samples, and the second phase is to use the chosen nearest samples to finely represent and classify each testing sample. In order to employ the locality of data to further improve classification performance of PCRC, we also propose two-phase weighted probabilistic collaborative representation based classification (TWPCRC). In the fine representation of TWPCRC, the probabilistic collaborative coefficients are weighted by the local distance similarities between each testing sample and all the training samples. The proposed methods are verified by the comparative experiments on three public image data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art collaborative representation-based classification methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a max-margin multi-scale convolutional factor analysis (MMCFA) model, which explores the strongly discriminative principle of max-margin learning to improve the classification performance of multi-scale convolutional factor analysis (CFA) model with application to image data classification. Compared with the traditional factor analysis (FA) model, the CFA model can maintain the spatial correlation among the image pixels in two-dimensional space and capture the structural information from images via convolution kernels. Moreover, to extract multi-level features, multi-scale convolution kernels are adopted to capture richer features at different scales of images. Since the unsupervised model may not offer discriminative factors for the classification task, it is expected to introduce the supervised information to the multi-scale CFA model when supervised information is available. To deal with it, a latent variable support vector machine (LVSVM) is linked to the factors learned from multi-scale CFA model, yielding max-margin discrimination, as the classification criterion in the feature space in our proposed model. The multi-scale CFA model and LVSVM learn parameters jointly in a united framework via the Gibbs inference. Experimental results on mixed national institute of standards and technology (MNIST) dataset, Fashion-MNIST dataset, SVHN dataset and measured synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images show that the learned convolution kernels and factors can describe data information well and the proposed model has excellent classification performance.

AB This article proposes a novel fuzzy recommendation system for stock market investors. This intelligent decision tool uses fuzzy Japanese candlesticks and includes the effect of currency devaluation on the forecasting. To do so, first the next market session is obtained by a new designed fuzzy forecasting trading system. Then, it is compared to the one obtained by a non-parametric system based on the k-nearest neighbor technique. Finally, an amount of money to be invested is considered using a new capital management fuzzy strategy. The results have been compared to an analogous fuzzy trading system that has the same all-or-nothing investment strategy with risk control, but where this capitalization is not included. Both intelligent decision systems have been applied to two very different stock markets, the American Nasdaq100 and the Spanish lbex35 markets, using the Buy and Hold investment strategy as benchmark. Results prove that the proposed fuzzy system with capitalization is profitable and presents high stability, and could be a good support system for investors. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, to capture the coherence of the investor's expectation we develop a new trapezoidal fuzzy numbers with an adaptive index, through which the membership degrees for favorable and unfavorable scenarios are transformed consistently to avoid the logical confusion. We also present the possibilistic expected mean, variance and skewness under the new measurement. Then, the new trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are employed in fuzzy mean-variance model and mean-variance-skewness model for optimal asset allocation. The validity and advantages of these models can be illustrated by the numerical examples in the end. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Predicting the popularity of videos on video sharing sites is important for the formulation of online advertising strategies and commercial marketing. The predicted popularity value can help the system decide which videos to recommend to users and determine the recommended order of related videos. However, the weakness of most previous methods has been that the prediction of video popularity is based on past usage data after upload. Early predictions cannot be made because they are dependent on past access data. To solve this problem, we propose a new method for the early prediction of video popularity based on the data available at the initial time of video upload. This study first uses a supervised learning approach to develop a video popularity prediction model. Then, to further improve the overall accuracy of the prediction, an ensemble model is developed for integration of these classification results to get the most accurate predictions. Empirical evaluation shows that these models can effectively predict the future popularity of videos at the time of uploading. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Learning to rank has become one of the most popular research areas in recent years. A series of learning to rank algorithms have been proposed to improve the ranking performance. In this work, we propose three learning to rank algorithms by directly optimizing evaluation measures based on the AdaRank algorithms. We name the three algorithms as AdaRank-ERR, AdaRank-MRR and AdaRank-Q which optimize three evaluation measures, Expected Reciprocal Rank (ERR), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Q-measure (Q), based on AdaRank, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a novel feature generation framework FG-FIREM to enhance the ranking performance. The framework generates effective document ranking features based on the ranking scores assigned by the proposed algorithms, and enriches the original feature space of learning to rank using the generated features for improving the ranking performance. We evaluate the proposed framework on three datasets from LETOR3.0 and the web dataset MSLR-WEB10K. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework can effectively improve the ranking performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Brain slice-to-volume registration is an essential problem in numerous clinical applications; it is aimed at determining the rigid transformation parameters for locating intraoperative 2D slices in the preoperative 3D volume. This task has several challenges: (1) it has to be carried out in real-time; (2) it should not require manual intervention; (3) it requires multimodal operation; (4) it should not require landmark; and (5) it should not require initialization. However, available methods are incapable of overcoming these obstacles simultaneously. In this study, a discrete strategy is introduced, and the slice-to-volume registration is transformed into a global multilabel classification problem. An automatic system using a convolutional neural network (CNN) is applied to implement multilabel classification. The network is trained by slices extracted from the volume and applied in a multibranch manner. Moreover, silhouettes are utilized to unify the multimodal images into the same metric. Centralization and spindle transformation are applied to reduce the dimension of the parameter space, resulting in fewer training samples and less computational complexity. This system exhibits the advantages of not requiring initialization, landmark, or manual intervention; moreover, it can satisfy the real-time and multimodal requirements simultaneously. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that our system can achieve highly accurate registration and strong robustness; moreover, it is observed to be superior to the state-of-the-art methods by an average of approximately 4.5 mm in terms of the mean target registration error.

AB Sequential Pattern Mining (SPM) is a popular data mining task with broad applications. With the advent of big data, traditional SPM algorithms are not scalable. Hence, many of the researchers have migrated to big data frameworks such as MapReduce and proposed distributed algorithms. However, the existing MapReduce algorithms assume the data as static and do not handle the incremental database updates. Moreover, they use to re-mine the updated database while new sequences are inserted. In this paper, we propose an efficient distributed algorithm for incremental sequential pattern mining (MR-INCSPM) using the MapReduce framework that can handle big data. The proposed algorithm incorporates the backward mining approach that efficiently makes use of the knowledge obtained during the previous mining process. Also, based on the study of item co-occurrences, we propose Co-occurrence Reverse Map (CRMAP) data structure. The issue of combinatorial explosion of candidate sequences is dealt using the proposed CRMAP data structure. Besides, a novel candidate generation and early prune mechanisms are designed using CRMAP to speed up the mining process. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on both the real and synthetic datasets. The experimental results prove the efficacy of MR-INCSPM with respect to processing time, memory and pruning efficiency. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Noisy image segmentation is a hot topic in natural, medical, and remote sensing image processing. It is among the non-trivial problems of computer vision having to address denoising and segmentation at the same time. Fuzzy C-means (FCM) is a clustering algorithm that has been shown to be effective at dealing with both segmentation-oriented denoising and segmentation at the same time. Moreover, with a high level of noise and other imaging artifacts, FCM loses its ability to perform image segmentation effectively. This paper introduces a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based feature enhancement approach in the wavelet domain for noisy image segmentation. This approach applies adaptive wavelet shrinkage using FCM clustering performance as an evaluation mechanism and also as the segmentation algorithm. The PSO-based process helps to enhance intensity features for clustering-based denoising, and also provides adaptivity for the system that performs well on a range of real, synthetic, and simulated noisy images with different noise levels and range/spatial properties. Furthermore, the algorithm applies edge enhancement based on Canny edge detector in order to further improve accuracy. Experiments are presented using three different datasets each degraded with different types of common noise. The presented algorithms show effective and consistent performance over a range of severe noise levels without the need for any parameter tuning. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To defend against an increasing number of sophisticated malware attacks, deep-learning based Malware Detection Systems (MDSs) have become a vital component of our economic and national security. Traditionally, researchers build the single deep learning model using the entire dataset. However, the single deep learning model may not handle the increasingly complex malware data distributions effectively since different sample subspaces representing a group of similar malware may have unique data distribution. In order to further improve the performance of deep learning based MDSs, we propose a Multi-Level Deep Learning System (MLDLS) that organizes multiple deep learning models using the tree structure. Each model in the tree structure of MLDLS was not built on the whole dataset. Instead, each deep learning model focuses on learning a specific data distribution for a particular group of malware and all deep learning models in the tree work together to make a final decision. Consequently, the learning effectiveness of each deep learning model built for one cluster can be improved. Experimental results show that our proposed system performs better than the traditional approach. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The subject of this research is prediction in a financial time series based on a model in the form of Markov chains. The essence of the considered algorithm is to create a sequence of time windows with a fixed length and a fixed division into intervals in the field of function values. The aim of the optimization consisting in finding the best window length, the number of windows and the number of intervals is to increase the predictive efficiency of the transition matrices. In the categories of expert systems, the presented computer program can be considered as imitating and replacing the investor in his manual activity and strongly supporting his mental effort.
   Two completely different time series were considered: the EUR/USD 1 h currency pair, and the WIG20 1d - the most important Polish stock exchange index. In both cases, the satisfactory adaptability of the proposed method was demonstrated, along with very good properties enabling the building of an effective investment strategy. Essential tests were performed for first-order Markov chains. These tests were also used for comparing the results of the study based on a Markov model of the second-order, which also achieved good results. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, three methods of extracting single document summary by combining supervised learning with unsupervised learning are proposed. The purpose of these three methods is to measure the importance of sentences by combining the statistical features of sentences and the relationship between sentences at the same time. The first method uses supervised model and graph model to score sentences separately, and then linear combination of scores is used as the final score of sentences. In the second method, the graph model is used as an independent feature of the supervised model to evaluate the importance of sentences. The third method is to score the importance of sentences by supervised model, then as a priori value of nodes in the graph model, and finally use biased graph model to score sentences. On the data sets of DUC2001 and DUC2002, the ROUGE method is used as the evaluation criterion, which shows that the three methods have achieved good results, and are superior to the methods of extracting summary only using supervised learning or unsupervised learning. We also validate that priori knowledge can improve the accuracy of key sentence selection in graph model. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the rise of the Internet, there is a growing need to build intelligent systems that are capable of efficiently dealing with early risk detection (ERD) problems on social media, such as early depression detection, early rumor detection or identification of sexual predators. These systems, nowadays mostly based on machine learning techniques, must be able to deal with data streams since users provide their data over time. In addition, these systems must be able to decide when the processed data is sufficient to actually classify users. Moreover, since ERD tasks involve risky decisions by which people's lives could be affected, such systems must also be able to justify their decisions. However, most standard and state-of-the-art supervised machine learning models (such as SVM, MNB, Neural Networks, etc.) are not well suited to deal with this scenario. This is due to the fact that they either act as black boxes or do not support incremental classification/learning. In this paper we introduce SS3, a novel supervised learning model for text classification that naturally supports these aspects. SS3 was designed to be used as a general framework to deal with ERD problems. We evaluated our model on the CLEF's eRisk2017 pilot task on early depression detection. Most of the 30 contributions submitted to this competition used state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that our classifier was able to outperform these models and standard classifiers, despite being less computationally expensive and having the ability to explain its rationale.

ID ONTOLOGY
AB The digital age is making more datasets available through the Internet, but their interoperability is still limited. The Semantic Web should play a fundamental role in achieving interoperable datasets. The semantic exploitation of data requires its efficient transformation into semantic formats and the integration of heterogeneous sources. Either the scalability of the existing tools for the semantic transformation of large volumes of data is limited or these tools do not provide a semantics-rich representation of the data.
   The goal of this work was to show how scalable semantic data transformation processes can be designed and implemented, thereby addressing the first limitation mentioned above. Here, we propose an application of high-performance computing techniques to overcome the scalability limitation. The proposed method was implemented as an upgrade of our Semantic Web Integration Tool (SWIT). Additional improvements for supporting the transformation process in SWIT are also described in this paper. We evaluated the new method by using three case studies from the areas of bioinformatics, movies and persons. The results showed a significant speed-up with respect to the original SWIT algorithm and the related tools. The lessons learnt in our work allowed us to configure semantic transformation processes efficiently. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over the last years complex data (e.g. images) have been growing in a very fast pace. This demands the ability to describe and to categorize them. To solve this problem it is essential to develop efficient and effective vision-based expert techniques. Hence, the cornerstone of our work is to propose a new methodology, called BoVW-CN, that combines Bag-of-Visual-Words and complex networks for describing keypoints detected in a given image. Our insight is that describing just the relevant points of an image we can achieve a more cost-effective and better image description. The obtained results testify that BoVW-CN, applied to public image datasets, outperforms the widely used state-of-the-art methods. We not only obtained good accuracies (e.g. 78.18%), but also performed analyses to find the best trade-off between computational cost and accuracy. Besides, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one to propose such integration of Bag-of-Visual-Words and complex networks through a texture-based focus. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The portfolio selection problem (PSP) concerns the resource allocation to a finite number of assets. In its classic approach, the problem aims at overcoming a trade-off between the risk and expected return of the portfolio. In recent years, additional constraints identified in financial markets have been incorporated into the literature, as an attempt to close the gap between theory and practice. In view of this, this paper introduces a unified multi-objective particle swarm optimization approach capable of solving a class of mean-variance PSPs. An adaptive ranking procedure is also developed, which is based on three mechanisms, including a new one. Extensive computational experiments were carried out in five PSP variants and the results obtained were compared with those found by problem-specific methods from the literature. The proposed approach was capable of finding highly competitive results in all problems and in most of the multi-objective metrics considered. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Image Matting is an actively researched topic due to its massive impact on the filmmaking industry. It refers to the accurate extraction of the foreground from an image and is a severely under-constrained problem. To constrain this issue, user input in the form of a trimap is required. However, users must generate this trimap manually, which is an exhausting and time-consuming process. To tackle this issue, we develop an expert system which is capable of generating trimaps automatically without any user interaction. We utilize three different techniques which use machine learning at the core. Our expert system receives knowledge from these three techniques which are processed by our system to generate trimaps automatically. We strongly believe that our study will have a strong impact on the filmmaking industry. Our study lays the groundwork for automatic trimap generation. Furthermore, our study can be applied to expert and intelligent systems related to image retrieval and automatic foreground/primary object segmentation in images or videos. We propose a simple yet effective approach to generate optimal trimaps automatically by combining image saliency, graph cut segmentation (lazy snapping), and fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM). Lazy snapping is an interactive segmentation technique that requires foreground and background scribbles as input. Instead of using user-provided foreground scribbles, we utilize a saliency map as foreground scribbles and input it to the lazy snapping. This results in a coarsely segmented foreground object. We use the corners as the background scribbles based on the assumption that most foreground objects are located in the center of the image. To generate an optimal trimap, we locally cluster the boundary region of the foreground segmentation using FCM. We tested our algorithm on alpha matting evaluation and salient object datasets. In addition to generating accurate trimaps automatically, the alpha mattes generated by our optimal trimaps contain fewer artifacts as compared to trimaps generated by previous works. Moreover, the alpha mattes computed using our optimal trimaps were computed faster as compared to computing alpha mattes with trimaps from previous works. We showed in our experiments that optimal trimaps can improve alpha matte quality by reducing artifacts. Finally, our approach does not rely on depth data like the previous methods. Our experiments show the effectiveness of our method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Process mining is a growing and promising study area focused on understanding processes and to help capture the more significant findings during real execution rather than, those methods that, only observed idealized process model. The objective of this article is to map the active research topics of process mining and their main publishers by country, periodicals, and conferences. We also extract the reported application studies and classify these by exploration domains or industry segments that are taking advantage of this technique. The applied research method was systematic mapping, which began with 3713 articles. After applying the exclusion criteria, 1278 articles were selected for review. In this article, an overview regarding process mining is presented, the main research topics are identified, followed by identification of the most applied process mining algorithms, and finally application domains among different business segments are reported on. It is possible to observe that the most active research topics are associated with the process discovery algorithms, followed by conformance checking, and architecture and tools improvements. In application domains, the segments with major case studies are healthcare followed by information and communication technology, manufacturing, education, finance, and logistics.

AB Social media has been a phenomenon but it is a double-edge sword that can bring about negative effects such as social media addiction. Nevertheless, very less attention has been given in unveiling the determinants of social media addiction. In this study, artificial intelligence and expert systems were applied through a hybrid SEM-artificial neural network approach to predict social media addiction. An integrated model of the Big Five Model and Uses and Gratification Theory was validated based on a sample of 615 Facebook users. Unlike existing social media studies that used SEM, in this study, we engaged a hybrid SEM-ANN approach with IPMA as the additional analysis. The new SEM-IPMA-ANN analysis is a novel methodological contribution where useful conclusion can be drawn based on not only the construct's importance but also its performance in prioritizing managerial actions. Primary focus will be given in improving the performance of constructs that exhibit huge importance with relatively low performance. Based on the normalized importance of the ANN analysis using multilayer perceptrons with feed-forward-back propagation algorithm, we found nonlinear relationships between neuroticism and social media addiction. This is a significant finding as previously only linear relationships were found. In addition, entertainment is the strongest predictor followed by agreeableness, neuroticism, hours spent and gender. The artificial neural network is able to predict social media addiction with an 86.67% accuracy. The new methodology and findings from the study will give huge impacts to the extant literature of expert systems and artificial intelligence generally and social media addiction specifically. We discussed the methodological, theoretical and practical contributions of the study. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Offline Signature Verification (OSV) is a challenging pattern recognition task, especially in the presence of skilled forgeries that are not available during training. This study aims to tackle its challenges and meet the substantial need for generalization for OSV by examining different loss functions for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We adopt our new approach to OSV by asking two questions: I. which classification loss provides more generalization for feature learning in OSV?, and 2. How integration of different losses into a unified multi-loss function lead to an improved learning framework?
   These questions are studied based on analysis of three loss functions, including cross entropy, Cauchy Schwarz divergence, and hinge loss. According to complementary features of these losses, we combine them into a dynamic multi-loss function and propose a novel ensemble framework for simultaneous use of them in CNN. Our proposed Multi-Loss Snapshot Ensemble (MLSE) consists of several sequential trials. In each trial, a dominant loss function is selected from the multi-loss set, and the remaining losses act as a regularizer. Different trials learn diverse representations for each input based on signature identification task. This multi-representation set is then employed for the verification task. An ensemble of SVMs is trained on these representations, and their decisions are finally combined according to the selection of most generalizable SVM for each user.
   We conducted two sets of experiments based on two different protocols of OSV, i.e., writer-dependent and writer-independent on three signature datasets: GPDS-Synthetic, MCYT, and UT-SIG. Based on the writer-dependent OSV protocol, On UT-SIG, we achieved 6.17% Equal Error Rate (EER) which showed substantial improvement over the best EER in the literature, 9.61%. Our method surpassed state-of-the-arts by 2.5% on GPDS-Synthetic, achieving 6.13%. Our result on MCYT was also comparable to the best previous results. The second set of experiments examined the robustness of our proposed method to the arrival of new users enrolled in the OSV system based on the writer-independent protocol. The results also confirmed that our proposed system efficiently performed the verification of new users enrolled in the OSV system. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Avanafil (AVA) is a recent FDA approved selective phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor used for oral treatment of erectile dysfunction. The oral bioavailability of the drug is challenged by its reduced water solubility, considerable presystemic metabolism, and altered absorption in the presence of food. Accordingly, this work aimed to surmount the aforementioned challenges through the development of optimized nanosized AVA invasomes with enhanced transdermal delivery. AVA invasomes were prepared according to a Box-Behnken experimental design to explore the impact of the following formulation factors: phospholipid % (X-1), ethanol % (X-2), terpene % (X-3), and terpene type (X-4) on vesicle size (Y-1) and entrapment efficiency (Y-2). The three numerical variables were used at three levels, while the categorical variable was used at two levels. The optimized formulation with vesicular size of 109.92 nm and entrapment efficiency of 96.98% was incorporated into a hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose-based transdermal film and characterized for its ex vivo permeation behavior and in vivo performance in rats. The optimized AVA invasomal film showed enhanced ex vivo permeation with an enhancement factor of 2.514 and a more than four-fold increase in relative bioavailability compared to the raw AVA film. These results provide insight into the capability of the optimized invasomal film to enhance the transdermal permeation and bioavailability of AVA.

AB Dual-modal imaging probes based on fluorescence (FL) and magnetic resonance (MR) modalities have attracted great attention due to their ability to combine the target specificity and high penetration into body tissues. In this study, we developed a potent nanocarrier with an effective photoluminescent emission and MR imaging capacity to deliver the doxorubicin to breast cancer 4T1 cells. The nanocarrier was fabricated by coating of quantum dots (QDs) with mesoporous silica followed by amine functionalization of the silica surface. Then, the doxorubicin was loaded into the silica pores and biheterofunctional PEG was covalently bound to the surface of core-shell quantum dot mesoporous silica nanoparticles. In order to target the DOX-loaded nanoparticles, the EpCAM DNA aptamer was attached on the surface of the DOX-loaded PEGylated nanoparticles. The synthesized NPs were analyzed for their size distribution, morphology, zeta potential and magnetic susceptibility using HRTEM, SEM and VSM analysis. The QD-encapsulated mesoporous silica revealed spherical shapes with an average particle size of 100 nm. The maximum encapsulation efficacy of doxorubicin in the silica pores was 25%. The in vitro release assessment demonstrated the pH-sensitive release of doxorubicin from the designed formulations. The in vitro cytotoxicity assays indicated that the aptamer targeted nanoparticles showed greater cytotoxicity than both non-targeted NPs and free DOX toward 4T1 and MCF-7 cell lines. The in vivo studies in 4T1 tumor-bearing Balb/c mice demonstrated that EpCAM aptamer could specifically deliver the DOX-loaded nanoparticles into the tumor tissue and cause remarkable inhibition of tumor growth as compared to non-targeted formulation and free DOX. Moreover, the in vivo MR and fluorescent imaging in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice confirmed the accumulation and residence of targeted system in tumor tissue even 24 h post-injection.
   This work presents a novel system for preparing bimodal imaging theranostic NPs through hybridization of silica and magnetic-fluorescent quantum dots.

AB The focus of the study was to understand the effects of formulation and process variables on the printlets quality manufactured by selective laser sintering (SLS) 3D printing. The Box-Behnken response surface methodology was used to evaluate effects of individual variables and combinations thereof. The formulation and process variables studied were printing chamber temperature (degrees C, X-1), laser scanning speed (mm/sec, X-2) and lactose monohydrate concentration (%, X-3). The responses studied were weight of printlets (mg, Y-1), hardness (N, Y-2), disintegration time (sec, Y-3) and dissolved drug fraction in 15 min (%, Y-4). The values of Y-1, Y-2, Y-3 and Y-4 varied from 170.2-257.0 mg, 5.5-32.0 N, 20-120 s and 64.4-97.5%, respectively. The studied factors showed statistically significant effects on the dependent variables (p < 0.04). The correlation coefficient between empirical and model predicted values for Y-1, Y-2, Y-3 and Y-4 were 0.999, 0.992, 0.998 and 0.983, respectively. The model was validated by an independent experiment and actual values of the responses were in close agreement with model predicted values. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy indicated no chemical interactions between the components of the formulation during printing process. X-ray powder diffractograms suggested a decrease in crystallinity of the drug and lactose in the printlets. Chemical images indicated uniform distribution of the drug. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray micro-CT scanning showed a very porous microstructure of the printlets with a porosity of about 37.89%. In conclusion, the SLS method of manufacturing provides a feasible and flexible avenue for fabricating dosage forms with tailored characteristics.

AB This study aimed to develop a dual action, namely anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial, nanogels (NG) for the treatment of periodontitis using triclosan (TCS) and flurbiprofen (FLB). Triclosan, an antimicrobial drug, was prepared as nanoparticles (NPs) using poly-epsilon-caprolactone (PCL), while flurbiprofen, an anti-inflammatory drug, was directly loaded in a chitosan (CS) based hydrogel. The entwinement of both NPs and hydrogel loaded systems resulted in the NG. The characterisation data confirmed that the developed formulation consists of nanosized spherical structures and displays pH-dependent swelling/erosion and temperature-responsiveness. Besides, the NG exhibited adequate bioadhesiveness using the chicken pouch model and displayed antibacterial activity through the agar plate method. An in-vivo study of the NG on experimental periodontitis (EP) rats confirmed the dual antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects which revealed an excellent therapeutic outcome. In conclusion, a dual action NG was successfully developed and proved to have superior therapeutic effects in comparison to physical mixtures of the individual drugs.

AB In recent years, researchers have made significant innovations in the field of tumor immunotherapy based on the knowledge of biology, oncology, and immunology. Tumor immunotherapy involves the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors and CAR (chimeric antigen receptor)-T cell therapy. As compared with conventional chemotherapy, immunotherapy is a potential approach to induce a more powerful immune response against tumor in the patient suffering from the advanced stage malignancy. Regardless of the developments made, a large number of clinical studies have confirmed that a substantial number of cancer patients still demonstrate non-responsiveness to immunotherapy, mainly due to the immunomodulating interactions of tumor cells with the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (iTME). It leads to immune tolerance of tumors and influences the efficacy of immunotherapy. This immune failure could be attributed to a complex immunosuppressive network comprising stromal and inflammatory cells, vessel system, ECM (extracellular matrix) and the cytokines released in tumor microenvironment (TME). The antitumor immune activity can be enhanced at different stages of tumor development by selective suppression of inhibitory pathways in the TME. This specific task can be achieved by using nano-sized drug delivery tools which are specific in their action and biocompatible in nature. Several recent studies have described the use of nanoparticles for iTME remodeling through the specific elimination of immunosuppressive cells, obstructing immune checkpoints, promotion of inflammatory cytokines, and amending the regulatory cells of the immune system. The efficacy of current immunotherapy can be improved by nanoparticle-mediated remodeling of iTME.

AB Efavirenz (EFZ) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) can be used simultaneously in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type1 infection. In this work the impact of TDF, a hydrophilic drug, on the solubility and dissolution rate of EFZ, a poorly water-soluble drug, was evaluated. EFZ/TDF binary mixtures in different molar ratios were prepared. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results indicate the formation of a eutectic mixture, the molar ratio of 65/35 being the eutectic point. It was observed an increase in the EFZ solubility in water and acidic conditions (0.1 N HCl and biorelevant medium), in the presence of TDF. On the other hand, there was a decreasing on EFZ solubility in phosphate buffer pH 6.8, probably influenced by the lower solubility of TDF in this medium. The high solubility of TDF in water and acidic medium may have contributed to improve the solubility of EFZ, as well as the formation of a eutectic mixture, supported by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses. However, TDF solubility and dissolution rate was not significantly influenced by the presence of EFZ.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of tableting process parameters, i.e. turret rotation speed, pre-compaction and main compaction pressures, and their interactions on layer adhesion of bilayer tablets. The elastic recovery after compaction was used as estimation for the elasticity of the material. Three potential pharmaceutical formulations were evaluated as combinations of immediate (microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, calcium phosphate, pregelatinized starch) and controlled drug release excipients (ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, polyvinyl acetate/polyvinylpyrrolidone). A 3-levels 3-factors central composite Design of Experiment was performed on each formulation, with layer adhesion selected as response. A custom-made shear test was used to determine the tablet tendency to delaminate. Main compaction and turret rotation speed were the most important parameters to be optimized during tablet manufacturing. Main compaction was the principal parameter leading to delamination in case of formulations with plastic materials, particularly at high pressures where the difference in elasticity of excipients had a major impact and was followed by turret rotation speed. The rotation speed did not have an effect on layer adhesion in the case of formulations with brittle excipients.

AB Current information about the pharmacokinetics of an ocular drug can only be achieved by invasive sampling. However, confocal Raman spectroscopy bears the potential to quantify drug concentrations non-invasively. In this project, we evaluated the detection and quantification of ocular ketorolac tromethamine levels with confocal Raman spectroscopy after topical administration.
   Confocal Raman spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were compared in terms of sensitivity of detection. Enucleated pig eyes were treated with different concentrations of ketorolac. Hereafter, ketorolac concentrations in the aqueous humor of pig eyes were analyzed by confocal Raman spectroscopy and HPLC.
   Subsequently, twelve rabbits were treated with Acular (TM) for four weeks. At several time points, ketorolac concentrations in aqueous humor of the rabbits were measured by confocal Raman spectroscopy followed by drawing an aqueous humor sample for HPLC analysis.
   In ketorolac treated pig eyes, both ex vivo Raman spectroscopy as well as HPLC were able to detect ketorolac in a broad concentration range. However, in vivo confocal Raman spectroscopy in rabbits was unable to detect ketorolac in contrast to HPLC.
   To conclude, confocal Raman spectroscopy has the capacity to detect ketorolac tromethamine in vitro, but currently lacks sensitivity for in vivo detection.

AB The use of nanoparticles for pulmonary delivery poses challenges such as the presence of anatomical barriers and the loss of bioactive components. Excipients are often used to facilitate delivery. Excipients suitable for nano-particle delivery are still being explored. Herein we introduce for the first time, spray-dried glycine microparticle-based excipients loaded with nanoparticles of the size range known to be taken up by alveolar macrophages. Using a microfluidic jet spray dryer, we produced glycine microparticles-based excipients which are spherical, uniform, cenospheric (hollow at core), and "coral-like" with average diameter of 60 +/- 10 mu m, 29 +/- 0.8% porosity, and showed their effective loading with glycine coated iron oxide superparamagnetic nanoparticles (GSPIONs). Our loading protocol with nanoparticles further increased microsphere porosity and improved aerodynamic performance unlike the dense, solid commercial excipient, Lactohale200 (TM). This demonstrates a feasible approach for delivery of such nanoparticles in the lung.

AB There have been many strategies to increase solubility, dissolution rates, and oral bioavailability of fenofibrate such as micronization, nanonization, solid dispersion, and emulsion so far. To our knowledge, only first three technologies have been applied in producing marketed products, and no combination of solid dispersion and pellet has been found even in laboratory-based reports. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop novel solid dispersion-based pellets via an one-step process directly from fenofibrate powder using layering method. Developed fenofibrate pellets were in vitro characterized on size distribution, dissolution rates, sensory evaluation and stability. In addition, the transformation from crystalline fenofibrate to amorphous fenofibrate, and intermolecular interactions of fenofibrate in solid dispersion were confirmed using physico-chemical methods. The dissolution rate of pellets containing fenofibrate was significantly higher than that of the reference, Lipanthyl (R) 160 mg tablets at early stage, satisfying the criteria in USP 38. The pellets, then, were packed in hard capsules for bioequivalence studies in experimental beagle dogs using a validated HPLC assay. Final findings of the present study should be beneficial for further development of new fenofibrate formulations containing solid dispersion-based pellets which were bioequivalent to Lipanthyl (R) 160 mg tablets.

AB Vaginally delivered tamoxifen is being developed as alternative to estrogen-based therapies for the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) symptoms in subjects at high risk for breast cancer, undergoing treatment for breast cancer with aromatase inhibitors or are breast cancer survivors. Tamoxifen (1 or 20 mg) was administered intra-vaginally to female rabbits once-daily over a 28-day period to assess its pharmacokinetics, systemic exposure and local vaginal tolerance. Plasma samples were taken to assess concentrations of tamoxifen and its metabolites 4-hydroxytamoxifen and N-desmethyltamoxifen over the first day of vaginal administration and following the last dose on Day 28. In-life observations included evaluation of the vaginal region for signs of irritation. At necropsy, vaginal irritation was assessed by the method of Eckstein which reflect collective histopathological grading of four parameters within the vagina including epithelial morphology, leukocytic infiltration, congestion, and edema. Uterine effects of vaginal tamoxifen were also assessed. Plasma concentrations of tamoxifen were higher following administration of 20 mg tamoxifen compared to 1 mg tamoxifen at both Day 1 and Day 28. The metabolite 4-hydroxytamoxifen could not be detected on Day 1 and concentrations were low at Day 28 at the 1 mg tamoxifen dose. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen concentrations were low, but detectable at Day 1 and 28 following administration of 20 mg tamoxifen. The metabolite N-desmethyltamoxifen was undetectable at the 1 mg and 20 mg doses on Day 1; it remained undetectable at the 1 mg tamoxifen dose at Day 28. N-desmethyltamoxifen was detected over the first 8 h of Day 28 then fell below the quantitation limits. There was little to no vaginal or systemic accumulation of tamoxifen following once-daily dosing for 28 days. Tamoxifen accounted for more than 85% of the total systemic exposure compared to its metabolites, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and N-desmethyltamoxifen. There was essentially no detectable vaginal irritation evident over the course of the study. At necropsy the individual Eckstein scores (maximum score of 16) of the proximal, mid, and distal vagina of females in the 1 mg and 20 mg dose groups were generally comparable in both groups and ranged from minimal to mild magnitude (1 mg dose group: ranging from 1 to 3 in the proximal vagina, 4 to 5 in the mid vagina, and 3 to 7 in the distal vagina; 20 mg dose group: ranging from 3 to 5 in the proximal vagina, 4 to 7 in the mid vagina, and 4 to 5 in the distal vagina). Overall, tamoxifen was absorbed and metabolized following vaginal administration and vaginal irritation was minimal to none at both doses.

AB Supercritical Emulsion Extraction (SEE) and Supercritical assisted Liposome formation (SuperLip), use dense gases such as carbon dioxide (dCO(2)) to fabricate advanced micro/nanocarriers.
   SEE uses dCO(2) to extract solvent from the oily phase of an emulsion and obtain biopolymer microbead; For this study, poly-Lactic Acid (PLA) microbeads of 1 +/- 0.2 mu m in mean size loaded at 1 mu g/mg(PLA) with Rhodamine B (ROD) were prepared by SEE; the beads showed a solvent residue lower than 10 ppm and encapsulated the fluorochrome with an efficiency of 90%. SuperLip uses dCO(2) to enhance lipid/ethanol/water mixing and to promote the ethanol extraction from liposome suspension. In this case, phosphatidyl-choline (PC) vesicles with a mean size of 0.2 +/- 0.05 mu m and loaded with Fluorescein Iso-ThioCyanate (FITC) at 8 mu g/mg(PC) were prepared; small unilamellar structure was observed for all the vesicles with FITC encapsulation efficiency of 80%. Ethanol residue of 50 ppm was measured in all the liposome suspensions.
   The bioavailability of microbeads and nanoliposomes was assessed through incubation with human monocytes previously isolated from healthy donors' blood. A specifically optimized protocol that allowed their quenching on the cell surface was developed to monitor by flow cytometer assay only the cell population that effectively internalized the carriers. When microbeads were tested, the percentage of alive internalizing monocytes was of about 30%. An internalization of 96.1 +/- 21% was, instead, obtained at dosage of 0.1 mg/mL for nanoliposomes. In this last case, monocytes showed a vitality of almost 100% after vesicles internalization at all the concentrations studied; on the other hand, cell apoptosis progressively increased in a dose/response manner, after polymer microbeads phagocytosis.
   The proposed data suggested that dCO(2) technologies can be reliably used to fabricate intracellular carriers.

AB The limited water solubility of sulfonamides provokes a search for new solvents offering not only increased solubility but also environmental and health safety. Therefore, six sulfonamides were studied in a series of natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) comprising choline chloride with multi-hydroxyl compounds. Experimental screening aimed at finding the optimized NADES composition revealed that unimolar proportion of choline chloride and glycerol offers the highest solubility advantage, equal up to 43 times compared with water at 37 degrees C. Besides, quantum chemistry computations based on the COSMO-RS protocol were conducted in order to gain an insight into the thermodynamic characteristics of the systems and to explain the origin of the observed solubility increase. It was found that the factor responsible for the solubility gain in NADES are the interactions between choline chloride and sulfonamide drug molecules, having the highest affinities expressed in terms of Gibbs free energy of corresponding reactions. Finally, utilizing the obtained results together with artificial neural networks led to a perfect match between experimental and predicted solubility, documented by the mean absolute percentage error value below 2.5%. The developed protocol seems to be so general and accurate that screening of potential new API-NADES systems can be significantly simplified.

ID DESIGN
AB The applicability of DCCs in a continuous freeze-drying concept based on spin freezing and infrared heating was evaluated. Maximum applicable filling volume was evaluated. Secondly the mechanistic model for the determination of the optimal dynamic infrared heater temperature during primary drying of regular vials during continuous freeze-drying was adapted and validated for DCCs. Finally, since spin frozen DCCs may be more prone to choked flow due to the small neck opening and the large product surface area, it was evaluated if the choked flow constraints in the model could be increased to improve the efficiency of the drying process. The experiments revealed that the maximum allowable filling volume for spin freezing at the current experimental setup was 0.8 ml which is 80% of the maximum filling volume. Applying the mechanistic model for the determination of the optimal dynamic infrared heater temperature during primary drying of the studied DCCs and experimentally verifying this determined infrared heater temperature trajectory resulted in an elegant freeze-dried product without visual signs of collapse. The experimentally determined primary drying time agreed with the one calculated based on the mechanistic model. Choked flow did not occur during the continuous freeze-drying of DCCs containing 3% sucrose or 3% mannitol.

AB Colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) is a common malignancy that develops in chronically inflamed mucosa and is usually accompanied by metastases at other sites. Puerarin, a natural isoflavone isolated from the root of the Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi, has potential anti-colon cancer activity. However, the poor solubility and low bioavailability of puerarin has restricted its application in the pharmaceutical industry. In the present study, pH-responsive alginate microspheres loaded with puerarin were prepared by emulsification/internal gelation for targeted treatment of colitis-associated colorectal cancer. Herein, puerarin, as an active drug, could participate in the construction of alginate microspheres with hydrogen bonding. The microspheres exhibited pH-responsive release behavior with little release of puerarin in simulated gastric fluid and high amounts (approximately 55%) of release in simulated colonic fluid. A fluorescence tracer indicated microspheres had high retention time of more than 20 h in the colon. Meanwhile, puerarin-loaded alginate microspheres not only significantly decreased the inflammatory response by downregulating the levels of pro-tumorigenic cytokines, but they reduced tumorigenesis and metastasis by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transitions in AOM/DSS-induced colitis-associated colorectal cancer in mice. The overall results suggested that puerarin-loaded alginate microspheres could effectively inhibit development of colonic tumors, which could be developed as a promising therapeutic strategy for colitis-associated colorectal cancer.

AB Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with half of patients developing metastasis within 5 years after curative treatment. Moreover, many patients cannot tolerate or complete systemic treatment due severe side-effects, reducing their effectiveness. Thus, targeted therapeutics are warranted to improve treatment outcomes and reduce toxicity. Herein, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles loaded with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and paclitaxel were surface-functionalized with a monoclonal antibody targeting sialyl-Lewis A (sLeA), a known glycan mediating hematogenous metastasis.
   Nanoparticles, ranging from 137 to 330 nm, enabled the controlled release of cytotoxic drugs at neutral and acid pH, supporting potential for intravenous and oral administration. Nanoencapsulation also reduced the initial toxicity of the drugs against gastric cells, suggesting it may constitute a safer administration vehicle. Furthermore, nanoparticle functionalization significantly enhanced targeting to sLeA cells in vitro and ex vivo (over 40% in comparison to non-targeted nanoparticles). In summary, a glycoengineered nano-vehicle was successfully developed to deliver 5-FU and paclitaxel therapeutic agents to metastatic gastric cancer cells. We anticipate that this may constitute an important milestone to establish improved targeted therapeutics against gastric cancer. Given the pancarcinomic nature of the sLeA antigen, the translation of this solution to other models may be also envisaged.

AB Eye drops containing hydrophilic drugs are commonly used to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma patients, but compliance to the treatement is commonly reduced by frequent dosing and eventual systemic side effects. Sustained-release drug delivery systems, such as ocular inserts, can reduce dosing, limit systemic exposure, reduce side effects, and, then, improve patient adherence to therapy. Here, we developed and evaluated chitosan/hydroxyethyl cellulose-based ocular inserts for sustained release of dorzolamide, a hydrophilic drug. Dorzolamide inserts (DI) were produced by solvent/casting method and characterized by various physicochemical techniques. Pharmacokinetics studies were performed using scintigraphic images and ex vivo biodistribution. The effectiveness of inserts was tested in glaucomatous rats. Characterization studies showed that the drug strongly interacted with the polymeric matrix, but in vitro results showed that DI took only 3 h to release 75% of dorzolamide entraped. However, scintigraphic images and ex vivo biodistribution studies revealed that more than 50% of Tc-99m-dorzolamide remained in the eye after 18 h of DI administration, while only about 30% of the drug remained in the eye after drops instilation. DI exerted significant hypotensive effect for two weeks, after single administration, while IOP values remained high in placebo and untreated groups. Eye drops were effective only during the treatment period. Only DI treatment prevented retinal ganglion cells death. Altogether, these findings evidenced the potential application of polymeric-based inserts for sustained release of dorzolamide in glaucoma management.

AB The aim of this study was to develop an ibuprofen microemulsion (IBU-ME) incorporated into in situ gels (microgels) for local delivery into periodontal pockets. The IBU-ME was prepared at a concentration of 1% w/v IBU. Various concentrations of the thermosensitive Pluronic (R) F127 (P127) solution and a series of combinations of the P127 solution and IBU-ME at a 1:1 ratio were initially developed and tested to determine their sol-gel transition temperatures (T-sol -> gel). Based on these studies, a constant concentration of P127 (11.1% w/v) and variable concentrations of IBU-ME were used to prepare the microgels. The mechanical properties (T-sol -> gel, gelling time (T-gel), viscosity, and viscoelastic properties) of the microgels were evaluated. The release of IBU from the microgels was determined in vitro. Rheological stability studies were performed to investigate the mechanical properties of the microgels after one month. The transition behavior studies demonstrated that the microgels are thermosensitive systems with pseudoplastic flow and their viscoelastic properties indicated that the elastic property was greater than the viscous property (G' > G ''). The results showed that the mechanical properties of the microgels depend on the concentration of IBU-ME. In addition, rheological stability studies demonstrated that T-gel and T-sol -> gel are increased after one month, whereas the viscosity and viscoelastic properties are decreased after one month. Owing to the rigid structure of the microgels, the release of IBU from the microgels followed a controlled-release pattern.

AB This study aimed to improve pharmacokinetic behavior and reduce safety concern of cyclosporine A (CsA) by UniORV (R) approach, a new platform for solid dispersion formulation. CsA-loaded UniORV (R) (UO/CsA) was prepared, and its physicochemical properties were evaluated in terms of droplet size distribution and dissolution. The pharmacokinetic behavior and nephrotoxic potential of orally-dosed CsA samples (10 mg-CsA/kg) were assessed in rats. After re-dispersion of UO/CsA in water, fine droplets were observed, and the mean diameter of droplets was calculated to be 45 nm. The UniORV (R) approach markedly improved the dissolution behavior compared with amorphous CsA in water. After oral administration of amorphous CsA, Neoral (R), and UO/CsA in rats, UO/CsA exhibited a 32% lower maximum concentration and 5.1 h longer mean residence time than those of Neoral (R). The oral absorption of CsA formulations was higher compared with amorphous CsA; in particular, the oral bioavailability of UO/CsA was 71-fold higher than that of amorphous CsA. Neoral (R) elicited nephrotoxicity with plasma creatinine level of 1.29 mg/dL; however, Neoral (R)-induced nephrotoxicity was attenuated in UO/CsA, as evidenced by a 15% lower plasma creatinine level of UO/CsA than that of Neoral (R). From these findings, UO/CsA might be a promising dosage form with improved biopharmaceutical properties of CsA.

AB The aim of this study was to develop a novel mucoadhesive cationic polymer by introducing primary amino groups to the polymeric backbone of starch. This newly synthesized polymer should exhibit superior properties over chitosan regarding solubility, mucoadhesiveness and cytotoxicity.
   Increasing amounts of sodium periodate were used to cleave and oxidize vicinal diols under aldehyde formation obtaining three different degrees of modification. In a subsequent step, primary amines were introduced via reductive amination with ammonia. Degree of amination was examined with TNBS-assay and zeta potential measurements. Mucoadhesiveness was investigated by rotating cylinder, tensile studies and rheological measurements.
   Primary amino groups were successfully attached to the polymer, proven by zeta potential measurements and UV-spectroscopy. Depending on the amount of periodate used in the reaction, coupling rates of up to 514 mu mol/g polymer were achieved. All synthesized derivatives showed 100% solubility in a pH range of 1-9. Aminated starch with the highest coupling rate of 514 mu mol/g showed a 9.5-fold prolonged retention time on intestinal mucosa and a 2.7-fold higher total work of adhesion on the mucosal tissue compared to chitosan. Furthermore, cytotoxic examinations of all tested polymers showed only a low impact on cell viability after 24 h, whereby starch derivatives possessed even less cell toxic effects than chitosan.
   Summarizing these results, cationic starch derivatives seem to be promising excipients for mucosal drug delivery with superior properties compared to chitosan, the most examined cationic polymer.

AB A new co-crystal of pharmaceutical active ingredient Apremilast was successfully designed in this work. The discovered co-crystal with benzoic acid significantly improves key properties like the dissolution and stability of an otherwise poorly soluble Apremilast. A crystallization process was developed, which includes efficient solvent selection and ternary phase diagram construction to minimize risks during scale up. To increase efficiency, we propose that both steps be combined into a single methodology based on solubility data. A suitable solvent for the co-crystallization process was selected and ternary phase diagrams were constructed using three different modifications of thermodynamic model of solid-liquid equilibria. Based on the obtained information, the co-crystallization process was scaled-up to 100 mL. This provides a feasible process to produce larger amounts of this promising pharmaceutical solid form of Apremilast necessary for further drug development.

AB Diabetic patients suffer from impaired wound healing. In this study, the anti-diabetic drug, Pioglitazone hydrochloride (PG), was loaded in three-dimensional (3D) composite scaffolds (SC) designed to be applied topically for the management of diabetic wounds. Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) of different molecular weight (E5, K4M or K15M) were used, in different ratios, with chitosan (CS) for the preparation of the 3D-SC. Investigations to examine the prepared SCs revealed that SC-F3 composed of CS /HPMC E5 (2:1) attained the highest porosity (99.12 +/- 5.01), highest water absorption capacity % (300.09 +/- 20.20), and attained the fastest drug release profile (p < 0.05), with release kinetics following the diffusion model. SEM microphotographs showed the highly porous structure of SC-F3. According to the modified Draize test, the selected 3D-SC (the medicated as well as the unmedicated) showed to be safe for skin application (PII = 0). During the in-vivo studies, both the selected PG-loaded SC and the unmedicated SC showed a significant improvement in the healing process compared to the untreated group, this was evidenced by the measurement of wound contraction % [627% and 467%, respectively, p < 0.05], as well as the level of some biomarkers (TNF-alpha, VEGF and MMP9). PG-loaded SC had a significantly better effect than the unmedicated SC (p < 0.05). Histopathological studies confirmed the complete tissue regeneration and healing process after the use of the selected PG-loaded scaffolds. The current study presents a feasible approach to support diabetic wound healing using a simple and safe formulation.

AB The objective of this study was to formulate an anticancer preclinical lead, IIIM-290, loaded in solid dispersions to enhance its solubility, dissolution, and oral pharmacokinetics. IIIM-290 is an in-house preclinical anticancer lead prepared by semisynthetic modification of the natural product rohitukine. It is an orally bioavailable Cdk inhibitor showing efficacy in xenograft models of pancreatic, colon and leukemia cancer. It demonstrated in vivo efficacy at a relatively higher dose owing to its poor aqueous solubility (similar to 8.6 mu g/mL). Binary and ternary solid dispersions containing PVP K-30, xanthan gum, and PEG-PPG-PEG were selected after solubility screening of various hydrophilic polymers. Several formulations with varying ratios of polymers, alone and in combination, were prepared and investigated for their effects on the solubility enhancement of IIIM-290. The binary solid dispersion VKB-SD75, prepared with PVP K-30 at the ratio of 1:4 w/w, was identified as the optimized composition that displayed 17-fold improvement in the aqueous solubility of IIIM-290. VKB-SD75 was scaled up to a 100-g scale. IIIM-290 and VKB-SD75 were evaluated for DSC, p-XRD, FTIR, H-1 NMR, SEM, in vitro dissolution, and oral pharmacokinetics, as well as for in vivo anticancer activity in the Ehrlich solid tumor model. The oral administration of VKB-SD75 in BALB/c mice resulted in a 1.9-fold improvement in plasma exposure. These findings also correlated well when the formulation was administered to mice in the Ehrlich solid tumor model. The newly developed solid dispersion is expected to reduce the dose of IIIM-290 by similar to 40-50% in preclinical and clinical studies.

AB We present here a method to increase the dissolution rate of drugs into polymers in order to make easier and faster the determination of the solubility curves of these mixtures. The idea is to prepare molecular/crystalline dispersions (MCD) where the drug is dispersed into the polymer, partly at the molecular level and partly in the form of small crystallites. We show that this particular microstructure greatly increases the dissolution rate of crystallites since: (1) The molecular dispersion has a plasticizing effect which greatly increases the molecular mobility in the amorphous matrix. (2) The fine crystallite dispersion in the matrix strongly reduces the distances over which the drug molecules have to diffuse to invade homogeneously the polymer by dissolution. MCD are here obtained by combining solid-state co-amorphization by high energy mechanical milling and then re-crystallization by annealing under a plasticizing atmosphere. We have used MCD to determine the solubility lines of the two polymorphic forms (I and II) of sulindac into PVP. The investigations have been performed mainly by DSC and powder x-ray diffraction.

AB Drug carriers with tumor targeting and controlled release have strong prospects for application in safe and efficient chemotherapy. Among various carriers, liposomes have good biocompatibility and can enhance the uptake of drugs by cancer cells. However, traditional liposomes have no specific targeting to cancer cells and are prone to insufficient stability, causing early leakage of the drug. Accordingly, organic-inorganic hybrid phospholipid and thermosensitive phospholipid are deliberately introduced into a liposome system to enhance the morphological and structural stability of the liposomes while realizing thermally controlled drug release. Furthermore, modification with a targeting ligand (WSG-peptide) can endow liposomes with active targeting to ovarian carcinoma cells. First, WSG-peptide was grafted onto the hydrophilic terminal of phospholipid molecules, and the organic-inorganic hybrid cerasome-forming lipid (CFL) was synthesized via a two-step chemical reaction. Then, the WSG-grafted thermosensitive liposomal cerasome (c-LIP-WSG) was prepared by thin-film hydration method. The results showed that the c-LIP-WSG had excellent structural stability both in storage and in a simulated circulation environment. In vitro drug release confirmed that the liposomes exhibited thermally controlled release. Cell uptake experiments and living fluorescence imaging of SKOV-3 tumor-bearing nude mice confirmed that the WSG-peptide modified liposomes were provided with specific targeting properties for ovarian carcinoma.

AB Substandard and/or falsified medicines are a growing global threat for health and they cause serious social and economic damage. In low- and middle-income countries the failure rate of these medical products is approximately 10.5%. 50% of medicines purchased over the Internet may be fake.
   According to Directive 2011/62/EU as regards the prevention of falsified medicines from entering into the legal supply chain, a unique identification should be put on each box of drugs in the EU from 9th February 2019.
   The current project is focusing on the development of a laser technology to mark an individual traceable code on the surface of the tablet. Usually, coatings contain titanium dioxide for sufficient coverage, which makes precision laser coding more difficult. New naturally coloured films do not include those excipients. In this research, we would like to compare the physical-chemical properties of conventionally and naturally coloured coatings after the laser marking procedure by using two types of lasers.
   This unique identification technology can be used for marking personalized medicine with the doses tailored for each patient, too.
   To sum up, the present findings may contribute to efficient and reliable laser marking solutions in the unique identification procedure. Based on our measurement results, it can be stated that excimer UV lasers are promising candidates as marking instruments for the polymer film in both conventionally and naturally coloured coatings.

AB We recently evaluated the suitability of polymersome delivery systems in simvastatin repurposing for treating neuroinflammation. The goal of the current study is to elucidate the therapeutic impact of particulate internalization by activated microglia on the resultant anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, we investigated the endocytic mechanism(s) involved in uptake and transport of simvastatin-loaded polymersomes by BV2 microglia cells coupled with delineation of the intracellular pathway(s) involved in regulating anti-inflammatory effects. Our data indicated that internalization of polymersome delivery systems by activated microglial BV2 cells was important in the suppression of nitric oxide (NO), TNF-alpha and IL-6 production. Further, we observed that the lipid raft/caveolae pathway had the most influential effect on polymersome internalization by microglia cells while clathrin-mediated endocytosis did not play a major role. Enhancement of anti-inflammatory effects of simvastatin could be attributed to inhibition of ERK1/2, JNK and AKT signaling pathways and internalization of polymersome delivery systems in activated microglia. Taken together, our data provided insights into how the intracellular trafficking of delivery systems by microglial could be a useful tool in modulating the desired anti-inflammatory effects of drugs.

AB Nose-to-brain delivery has gained significant interest over the past several decades. This has resulted in numerous strategies described to improve the delivery of drugs to the brain directly through the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity. In some cases, intranasal administration may be more effective than other routes of administration in treating central nervous system and related disorders. Here, we briefly review the strategies that have been used to facilitate nose-to-brain delivery as well as approaches to block the delivery of drugs from the nose to the brain. Even though numerous strategies have already been used to increase nose-to-brain delivery, the research for strategies inhibitory of nose-to-brain delivery seems to be scarce.

AB Avobenzone (AVO), oxybenzone (OXY), and octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC), are widely used UV filters. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of incorporation in mesoporous silica (SBA-15) on their cutaneous deposition and permeation. Stick formulations containing "free" and "incorporated" UV filters (SF1 and SF2, respectively) were prepared and characterized with respect to their physicochemical, thermal, and functional properties. Cutaneous delivery experiments using porcine skin with quantification by UHPLC-MS/MS, demonstrated that skin deposition of AVO and OXY after application of SF2 for 6 and 12 h was significantly lower than that from SF1 at each time-point (Student t-test, p < 0.05): e.g. OXY permeation across the skin was 30-, 12- and 1.5-fold lower after 6, 12 and 24 h, respectively, following application of SF2. Cutaneous biodistribution profiles of AVO and OXY to 800 mu m evidenced a significant decrease in the amounts in the viable epidermis and dermis. In contrast, deposition of the more lipophilic OMC was not significantly different (p > 0.05). In vitro photoprotective efficacy results demonstrated that adsorption/entrapment of UV filters enhanced the sun protection factor by 94%. In conclusion, SBA-15, an innovative mesoporous material, increased photoprotection by UV filters while reducing their cutaneous penetration and transdermal permeation.

AB Micro fabricated delivery systems have shown promise in increasing oral bioavailability of drugs. Micrometer-sized polymeric devices (microcontainers) have the potential to facilitate unidirectional drug release directly into the intestinal mucosa whereby, drug absorption can be enhanced. The aim of this study was to develop an ex vivo model to investigate mucosal adhesion and orientation of microcontainers. Furthermore, to investigate how microcontainers with varying height, shape and material behave in regards to mucoadhesion and orientation. Microcontainers were placed at the top of an inclined piece of porcine small intestine. The tissue was perfused with biorelevant medium followed by microscopic examination to observe the orientation and amount of microcontainers on the tissue. The mucoadhesion of the microcontainers were evaluated based on the observed position on the tissue after being exposed to flow. When comparing the varying types of microcontainers, good adhesion was in general observed since most of the microcontainers were located in the beginning of the intestine. Microcontainers fabricated from the epoxy-based photoresist SU-8 had a slightly better adherence than those fabricated from poly-epsilon-caprolactone (PCL). The orientation of the microcontainers appeare to be dictated mainly by the height. In general, the model showed promising results in evaluating mucoadhesion and orientation.

AB Although vaginal films were initially developed for a fast release of the drug, with the adequate formulation they can also be useful for sustained release. The latest strategies for the prevention of the sexual transmission of HIV have moved towards sustained-release dosage forms, so films may be an effective strategy that could also improve the patient's comfort. A hydrophilic polymer (hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose) and an amphiphilic polymer (zein) have been evaluated for the development of Tenofovir sustained-release vaginal films. The modification of the film's properties by the inclusion of polar (glycerol and polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG)) and amphiphilic (tributyl citrate and oleic acid) plasticisers was also evaluated. The films' physicochemical and mechanical properties were determined. The in vitro release of Tenofovir from the films and their bioadhesive capacity and behaviour in simulated vaginal fluid were also assessed. The combination of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and zein in films (ratio 1:5), with the inclusion of PEG (40% w/w) proved not only to have excellent mechanical properties, but was also able to release TFV in a sustained manner for 120 h and remain attached to biological tissues throughout this time. This film could be an interesting option for the prevention of sexual transmission of HIV.

AB New approaches integrating stimuli-responsive linkers into prodrugs are currently emerging. These "smart" prodrugs can enhance the effectivity of conventional prodrugs with promising clinical applicability. Oxidative stress is central to several diseases, including cancer. Therefore, the design of prodrugs that respond to ROS stimulus, allowing a selective drug release in this condition, is fairly encouraging. Aiming to investigate the ROS-responsiveness of prodrugs containing the ROS-cleavable moiety, Thioketal (TK), we performed proof-of-concept studies by synthesizing ROS-responsive conjugate, namely mPEG-TK-Cy5, through exploiting Cy5 fluorescent dye. We demonstrated that, differently to non-ROS-responsive control conjugate (mPEG-Cy5), mPEG-TK-Cy5 shows a selective release of Cy5 in response to ROS in both, ROS-simulated conditions and in vitro on glioblastoma cells. Our results confirm the applicability of TK-technology in the design of ROS-responsive prodrugs, which constitutes a promising approach in cancer treatment. The translatability of this technology for other diseases treatment makes this a highly relevant and promising approach.

AB In this study, polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugated melanin nanoparticles (MNPs) were prepared (PEG-MNPs). A model chemotherapy drug, doxorubicin (DOX), was loaded into the PEG-MNPs with varied concentrations (0.125, 0.250, 0.500 mg/mL). TEM images showed that, DOX-PEG-MNPs are spherical-shaped and 15 +/- 2.2 nm in diameter. FTIR spectroscopy analysis demonstrated that MNPs were successfully modified with PEG. The UV-Vis spectroscopy results showed that the drug loading capacity of MNPs was 0.7 mg/ml of DOX in 2 mg/ml of PEG-MNPs. The time course data showed that, the release behavior of DOX from MNPs was primarily diffusion controlled. In vitro cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that MNP and PEG-MNP did not show any toxic effect on mouse fibroblast cells while DOX-PEG-MNP was able to inhibit the proliferation of human breast cancer cells. The results confirm that the application area of MNPs in controlled and prolonged drug release could be extended to the different types of cancer therapeutics.

AB The aim of this work was to optimize the preparative process of quercetin loaded casein nanoparticles as well as to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of this flavonoid when administered orally in Wistar rats. Nanoparticles were obtained by coacervation after the incubation of casein, 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) and quercetin in an aqueous environment. Then, nanoparticles were purified and dried. The resulting nanoparticles displayed a size of 200 nm with a negative zeta potential and a payload of about 32 mu g/mg. Release studies showed a zero-order kinetic, suggesting a mechanism based on erosion of the nanoparticle matrix. For the pharmacokinetic study, quercetin was orally administered to rats as a single dose of 25 mg/kg. Animals treated with quercetin-loaded casein nanoparticles displayed higher plasma levels than those observed in animals receiving the solution of the flavonoid (control). Thus, the relative oral bioavailability of quercetin when administered as casein nanoparticles (close to 37%) was found to be about 9-times higher than the oral solution of the flavonoid in a mixture of PEG 400 and water. In summary, the combination of casein and 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin produces nanoparticles that may be a good option to load quercetin for both nutraceutical and pharmaceutical purposes.

AB The naturally occurring anthraquinone derivative hypericin is a highly potent photosensitiser. Several in vitro studies show high phototoxicity of the pigment towards gram-positive bacteria. Nevertheless, the highly lipophilic nature and poor bioavailability prevent its application in daily clinical practice thus leading to a limited therapeutic value of hypericin. Liposomal encapsulation could help overcome these limitations and would make hypericin available for daily clinical practice. The use of liposomes as carriers for hypericin in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is quite new. The aim of this work was to improve the photodynamic efficiency of the previously mentioned carriers by entrapping hypericin in the aqueous compartment of the liposomes. Therefore, a water-soluble inclusion complex of hypericin and (2-hydroxypropyl)-beta-cyclodextrin (HypHP beta CD) was prepared. After encapsulation of the inclusion complex into DSPC and DSPC/DPPC/DSPE-PEG liposomes with the dehydration-rehydration vesicle (DRV) method, the formulations were physicochemical characterised. The photodynamic efficiency towards the gram-positive model strain Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. bovis. was tested on planktonic cells as well as on biofilms. DSPC liposomes achieved a 4.1log reduction and the DSPC/DPPC/DSPE-PEG liposomes a 2.6log reduction in growth of planktonic bacteria, while HypHP beta CD showed total eradication. Even bacterial cells growing in a biofilm could be treated effectively in vitro.

AB Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is an emerging health problem, challenging the effective control of global TB. Current treatment of DR-TB includes administration of multiple anti-TB drugs via oral and parenteral routes for a duration of 20-28 months. High systemic exposure, side effects and lengthy treatment time are problems affecting current treatment. The success rate of current lengthy treatment regimens is generally < 50%. Bedaquiline, a new anti-TB drug is synergistic with pyrazinamide and in combination with moxifloxacin accelerates sputum-culture conversion. Therefore, a triple combination of these drugs may have the potential to shorten the treatment time and improve treatment success. Additionally, inhalation of these drugs in combination may be advantageous due to the direct delivery to the lungs, possibly reducing systemic exposure. This study aimed to develop an inhalable triple combination powder of bedaquiline, moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide and study their physicochemical properties and safety.
   An inhalable (aerodynamic diameter: <= 2.4 mu m) triple combination powder of bedaquiline, moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide with 20% w/w of L-leucine was prepared using a Buchi Mini Spray-Dryer. Combination powder consisted of spherical and porous particles. In vitro aerosolization (fine particle fraction, FPF) determined using a next generation impactor (NGI) showed improved FPF as a combination powder (> 75.0%) when compared to single drug-only formulations (< 45.0%). The powder was non-toxic to A549 and Calu-3 cells up to 100 mu g/mL and stable at 30 +/- 2% RH and ambient room temperature during one-month storage.
   This is the first study reporting the development of inhalable triple combination powder of bedaquiline, moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide with high aerosolization efficiency. The improved aerosolization may help to deliver a high dose of these drugs to treat drug-resistant tuberculosis.

AB Nanofiber-based wound dressings are currently being explored as delivery systems of different biomolecules for avoiding skin infections as well as improve/accelerate the healing process. In the present work, a nanofibrous membrane composed of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and lysine (Lys) was produced by using the electrospinning technique. Further, anti-inflammatory (ibuprofen (IBP)) and antibacterial (lavender oil (LO)) agents were incorporated within the electrospun membrane through blend electrospinning and surface physical adsorption methods, respectively. The obtained results demonstrated that the PVA_Lys electrospun membranes incorporating IBP or LO displayed the suitable morphological, mechanical and biological properties for enhancing the wound healing process. Moreover, the controlled and sustained release profile attained for IBP was appropriate for the duration of the wound healing inflammatory phase, whereas the initial burst release of LO is crucial to prevent wound bacterial contamination. Indeed, the PVA_Lys_LO electrospun membranes were able to mediate a strong antibacterial activity against both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, without compromising human fibroblasts viability. Overall, the gathered data emphasizes the potential of the PVA_Lys electrospun membranes-based drug delivery systems to be used as wound dressings.

AB In the present study, we developed and evaluated an in situ gelling system based on hexanoyl glycol chitosan (H-GCS) for enhanced ocular bioavailability. An aqueous solution of H-GCS exhibited a typical sol-gel transition at 32 degrees C. The formed H-GCS hydrogel was characterized by rheology and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). H-GCS had minimal in vitro cytotoxicity against L-929 and HCEC cells over a concentration range of 0-0.8 mg/mL. Additionally, the H-GCS hydrogel exhibited good ocular tolerance and biocompatibility after a single instillation. Moreover, H-GCS hydrogel significantly prolonged the precorneal retention of fluorescein sodium compared with its aqueous solution. An in vivo pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that the levofloxacin-loaded H-GCS hydrogel could provide a significantly higher C-max and AUC(0-12h) compared with the levofloxacin aqueous solution, thus increasing ocular bioavailability. Overall, the proposed H-GCS hydrogel acts as an in situ gelling system that might represent a promising vehicle for topical ocular drug delivery.

AB This study aims to prove the value of the polyoxazolines polymer family as surfactant in formulations for topical application and as an alternative to PEG overuse. The amphiphilic polyoxazolines (POx) were demonstrated to have less impact on cell viability of mice fibroblasts (NIH3T3) than their PEG counterparts. Mixed micelles, made of POx and phosphatidylcholine, were manufactured using thin film and high pressure homogenizer process. The mixed micelles were optimized to produce nanosized vesicles of about 20 nm with a spherical shape and stable over 28 days. The natural lipophilic antioxidant, quercetin, was successfully encapsulated (encapsulation efficiency 94 +/- 4% and drug loading 3.6 +/- 0.2%) in the mixed micelles with no morphological variation. Once loaded in the formulation, the quercetin impact on cell viability of NIH3T3 was decreased while its antioxidant activity remained unchanged. This work highlights the capacity of amphiphilic POx to create, in association with phospholipids, stable nanoformulations which show promise for topical delivery of antioxidant and ensure skin protection against oxidative stress.

AB The main goal of this study was the design, development and characterization of a chitosan based scaffolding substrate including three glycosaminoglycans and collagen to provide an optimal microenvironment for human mesemchymal stem cells isolated from adipose tissue (hMSCs). Chitosan scaffolds provide a moist wound environment which promotes healing and epidermal regeneration. Furthermore, the importance of extracellular molecules such as glycosaminoglycans in wound healing makes them essential ingredients in these types of formulations. The physical properties of hydrogels scaffolds and stability were investigated. The scaffolds were evaluated by structural and microscopic assays, as well as cell culture analyses. The hydrogel with best suitable properties was selected as candidate scaffold for hMSCs encapsulation. The viability of hMSCs remained above 75%, indicating good cell viability. The number of living hMSCs in the scaffold reached a steady state up to similar to 100% at days 5 and 7. Scanning electron microscopy showed irregular compartments with the presence of the hMSCs. These findings indicated that our hydrogel scaffold provided a suitable niche for cell viability which could be considered a promising candidate for further in vivo studies.

AB Co-amorphous mixtures have been demonstrated to represent a promising approach for enhancing the dissolution of poorly water-soluble drugs. However, little is known of their permeability properties, especially through biological membranes, or about the relationship between their dissolution and permeability. In the present study, co-amorphous glibenclamide (GBC) mixtures with two amino acids, arginine (ARG) and serine (SER), in molar ratios of 1:1 were prepared by cryomilling. Their dissolution and permeability properties were studied in side-by-side diffusion chambers using cell layers containing Madine Darby kidney cells overexpressing P-glycoprotein (Pgp) transporters (MDCKII-MDR1), as Pgp may influence the absorption of GBC. Furthermore, two other compounds, the flavonoid quercetin (QRT) which is a Pgp inhibitor and the surfactant, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), were used as excipients to investigate if they improved either passive or active diffusion of GBC. In addition, amorphous QRT and a co-amorphous mixture of GBC and QRT (1:1) were characterized with respect to their solid-state properties and physical stability. It was demonstrated that co-amorphous GBC mixtures exhibited superior dissolution properties over the corresponding physical mixtures and amorphous GBC. Furthermore, the co-amorphous GBC-ARG-SLS mixture exhibited a 9-fold increase in permeating through the MDCKII-MDR1 cell layer as compared to the corresponding physical mixture. There was a correlation between the dissolution and permeability area under curve (AUC) values, evidence that the main mechanism behind the improved permeability of co-amorphous mixtures was their improved dissolution. The simultaneous dissolution/permeation testing with side-by-side diffusion chambers and MDCKII-MDR1 cells proved to be a feasible method for evaluating the dissolution/permeation interplay of amorphous compounds.

AB In this study, the impact of binder distribution on the tabletability and compactibility of granules produced by twin-screw melt granulation was investigated. To this end, two grades of dicalcium phosphate anhydrous (fine and coarse) were used as model substances (filler) in combination with two grades of poloxamer (fine and coarse) as melt binder at three concentrations. For the fine filler, granule forming followed the immersion mechanism, whereas a distribution mechanism was observed in case of the coarse filler. Compared to the granules prepared with the coarse filler, the tabletability of granules prepared with the fine filler increased more pronouncedly compared to the corresponding physical mixtures (PM). In general, tabletability, compressibility and compactibility depended predominantly on the distribution of the binder in the tablet, and the homogeneity of distribution correlated with increased tensile strength. Binder distribution was analysed using scanning electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM/EDX) and quantified by image-analysis of the tablet surface. PMs in general varied in tabletability. However, even at tabletability similar to the granules, all PMs suffered from poor flow and/or segregation.

AB In the pharmaceutical field, green fluidized bed granulation (GFBG) is a novel and eco-friendly manufacturing technology used to produce desired granules via simple blending and spraying steps at ambient temperature using a standard fluidized bed granulator. However, the relations between water content and granule and tablet qualities have not yet been elucidated for GFBG. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the influence of different water quantities used in the GFBG process on granule and tablet qualities. In addition, results from the GFBG process were compared with those from the moisture-activated dry granulation (MADG) process.
   In terms of tablet tensile strength and disintegration time, GFBG had a wider acceptable range for added water quantity (2.0-5.0%) than did MADG. For all added water quantities, the GFBG granules were within the upper limit of water activity (a surrogate of free water amount), which was 0.61 for tensile strength and 0.55 for disintegration time. The air flow in the GFBG process may have reduced the excess free water on the granules during the absorption process.
   It was concluded that as compared with MADG, GFBG may be a more robust process for manufacturing granules and tablets with superior properties.

AB Previously, we synthesized 4-(N)-docosahexaenoyl 2', 2'-difluorodeoxycytidine (DHA-dFdC), a novel lipophilic compound with a potent, broad-spectrum antitumor activity. Herein, we report a solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) formulation of DHA-dFdC with improved apparent aqueous solubility, chemical stability, as well as efficacy in a mouse model. The SLNs were prepared from lecithin/glycerol monostearate-in-water emulsions emulsified with D-a-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) and Tween 20. The resultant DHA-dFdC-SLNs were 102.2 +/- 7.3 nm in diameter and increased the apparent solubility of DHA-dFdC in water to at least 5.2 mg/mL, more than 200-fold higher than its intrinsic water solubility. DHA-dFdC in a lyophilized powder of DHA-dFdC-SLNs was significantly more stable than the waxy solid of pure DHA-dFdC. DHA-dFdC-SLNs also showed an increased cytotoxicity against certain tumor cells than DHA-dFdC. The plasma concentration of DHA-dFdC in mice intravenously injected with DHA-dFdC-SLNs in dispersion followed a bi-exponential model, with a half-life of similar to 44 h. In mice bearing B16-F10 murine melanoma, DHA-dFdC-SLNs were significantly more effective than DHA-dFdC in controlling the tumor growth. In addition, histology evaluation revealed a high level of apoptosis and tumor encapsulation in tumors in mice treated with DHA-dFdC-SLNs. DHA-dFdC-SLNs represents a new DHA-dFdC formulation with improved antitumor activity.

AB Nanoparticulate systems intended for the use in drug delivery are getting more and more complex. Composite nanoparticles, such as core-shell particles are designed in order to be used for co-delivery of drugs or a modified release profile. Often the structure can only be postulated by the preparation process, such as surface polymerization, but cannot be experimentally determined due to a lack of appropriate analytical methods. Here a core-shell particle system composed of two biodegradable and biocompatible materials, gelatin and PLGA, is developed. In order to reveal the actual polymer distribution, a combination of cryo-transmission electron microscopy and energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy was established. Using the occurrence of specific elements in combination with degradation kinetics induced by the electron beam allows to conclude on the nanoparticles' architecture. Based on these methods and thus, the particle composition, the drug delivery system can be further developed.

AB Tumor cell nucleus is the ultimate target of many first-line chemotherapeutics and therapeutic genes. However, nuclear drug delivery is always hampered by multiple intracellular obstacles especially low efficiency of cellular uptake and insufficient nuclear trafficking. It is urgent to establish novel nuclear drug delivery systems to simultaneously overcome barriers including cell membranes and nuclear envelope. Herein, an N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) polymer-based drug delivery system was designed to achieve enhanced intracellular and intranuclear drug delivery. A biomimetic peptide (SVS-1), derived from antimicrobial peptides, which was reported to efficiently penetrate cell membranes and translocate rapidly into nucleus without decreasing cell viability, was conjugated to the HPMA copolymer backbone. The in vitro studies showed that SVS-1 could enhance the uptake and nuclei accumulation of HPMA copolymer by 4.1 and 7.0-fold on human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) separately compared with corresponding non-SVS-1 modified HPMA copolymers (P-DOX). This also transferred to greater DNA damage, more apoptosis and superior cytotoxicity (2.4-fold) of doxorubicin which was chosen as the model drug and attached to SVS-1 modified HPMA copolymer (SVS-1-P-DOX). Furthermore, the in vivo investigation revealed that compared with free doxorubicin, SVS-1-P-DOX not only showed prolonged blood circulation and preferential tumor accumulation, but also suppressed tumor growth more efficiently with tumor growth inhibition of 78.7% in HeLa tumor-bearing BALB/c nude mice without causing noticeable physiological change in major organs. These results demonstrated that the SVS-1 modification was a promising strategy for contemporaneously overcome cell membranes and nuclear envelope, which might provide new opportunities for constructing nucleus-targeted anticancer therapy.

AB Skin is the first protection of human body. It is always challenged by a range of external factors, resulting in the wounds of skin. Hydrogel, as a dressing with multiple advantages, causes increasing interests or the applications in wound treatment. However, the function and importance of micro-environment of wound region are frequently neglected. In this study, we successfully developed a chemokine loaded biomimetic hydrogel as a functional reservoir to stimulate the rapid in situ recruitment of BMSCs for fast wound repair and regeneration. The biomimetic hydrogel was fabricated by using the Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) combined with chitosan (CS) as the hybrid materials. The fabricated hydrogel possesses many features such as the porous structure, high swelling rate and moisture retention property. More importantly, the incorporated chemokine could be released with a sustained manner from the hydrogel and recruited the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) significantly both in vitro & in vivo. Moreover, the hydrogel was demonstrated to be highly biocompatible to the skin tissue without any side effect or irritation observed. Topical delivery of chemokine by the biomimetic PVA/CS hybrid material based hydrogel is demonstrated as a promising carrier to accelerate wound repair and regeneration without inducing scar formation and any other negative complications. The PVA/CS/SDF-1 hydrogel was shown a novel therapeutic system for wound therapy.

AB Nanoformulations with advantages in drug delivery, safety and pharmacodynamics have been booming as a promising strategy for cancer therapy. However, the traditional nanocarrier still suffers from the low drug loading capacity, potential systematic toxicity, unclear metabolism, and other uncertainties. To overcome these issues, carrier-free nanodrugs with desirable bioactivity were developed rapidly and drawn considerable attention. Meanwhile, the multifunctional self-delivery nanoarcheticture fabricated by a simple and "green" method, has significant advantages in synergistic cancer therapy and inhibition of multidrug resistant (MDR). Till now, carrier-free nanoparticles for tumor theranostics, phototherapy, chemotherapy, diagnose and synergistic therapy, have made outstanding progress. In this review, we make an integrated and exhaustive overview of lately reports on carrier-free nanodrug delivery systems formed by several active agents. We summarize the self-assembly and modified strategies, with emphasis on application superiority of carrier-free nanocrystal, and give new insight into the establishment of ideal nanosystems for cancer treatment.

AB Although flavonoid compounds have various pharmacological applications, they generally exhibit low oral bioavailability due to their poor aqueous solubility. To address this problem, numerous promising strategies, such as the use of an absorption enhancer, structural transformation (e.g., prodrugs, glycosylation), and pharmaceutical technologies (e.g., carrier complexes, nanotechnology, cocrystals), have been developed and applied to deliver poorly water-soluble flavonoids. These formulation approaches can effectively improve the oral bioavailability of flavonoids by enhancing their solubility, dissolution rate and permeability; preventing their degradation or metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract; and/or delivering them directly to their physiological targets. This review comprehensively summarizes the viable oral delivery systems for insoluble flavonoids to date and discusses their design principles, potential advantages, possible limitations, and oral delivery efficiency, which will provide some useful clues and references to overcome the absorption barrier of these insoluble flavonoids.

AB Osteosarcoma is the bone tumor that most commonly affects children and teenagers with low survival rate because of metastatic relapse or recurrence. Cisplatin is a first-line chemotherapy for osteosarcoma. However, severe side effects limit its use in clinic. Selenium (Se) is an anticarcinogen that can protect normal tissues from side effects of chemotherapy. In this study, nanoparticles were used to co-deliver cisplatin and Se in a synergistic combination. Se-doped and lipid-coated calcium carbonate nanoparticles loaded with cisplatin (Pt/Se@CaCO3 NPs) were prepared by a reverse microemulsion method. The NPs delivered cisplatin and Se to tumour cells at an optimal synergistic ratio of 1:1 (mol/mol) both in vitro and in an osteosarcoma xenograft model. These results demonstrate that Pt/Se@CaCO3 NPs have great prospects for the osteosarcoma therapy.

AB Eid1 is a member of the EID protein family, which regulates differentiation, transcription and acetyltransferase activity. Accumulating evidence suggests that Eid1 is relevant to neurological disorder, but the main function of Eid1 is still unclear, especially in the brain. To better understand this issue, we generated Eid1-knockout (Eid1-KO) mice and profiled its gene expression changes in the brain by RNA sequencing. This study identified 2531 genes differentially expressed in Eid1-KO mice compared with the wild-type, then qRT-PCR verification demonstrated that the transcriptomic data are reliable.
   By protein-protein interaction cluster analysis, 'regulation of cell proliferation' were unexpectedly discovered as important Eid1 functions. We then isolated neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and showed that the number of neurospheres and the proliferation rate of Eid1-KO NPCs were obviously lower than that in the control group, furthermore, CCK-8 and immunofluorescence assay clearly demonstrated that the Eid1-KO NPCs showed significantly less cell proliferation than the control group.
   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive report of the Eid1-KO transcriptome of mice brain. Our analysis and experimental data provide a foundation for further studies on understanding function of Eid1 in the brain.

AB Flavonoids are major polyphenol compounds in plant secondary metabolism. The hydroxylation pattern of the B-ring of flavonoids is determined by the flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H) and flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase (F3'5'H). In this paper, one CsF3'H and two CsF3'5'Hs (CsF3'5'Ha and CsF3'5'Hb) were isolated. The phylogenetic tree results showed that F3'H and F3'5'Hs belong to the CYP75B and CYP75A, respectively. The Expression pattern analysis showed that the expression of CsF3'5'Ha and CsF3'5'Hb in the bud and 1st leaf were higher than other tissues. However, the CsF3'H had the highest expression in the 4th and mature leaf. The correlation analysis showed that the expression of CsF3'5'Hs is positively associated with the concentration of B-trihydroxylated catechins, and the expression of CsF3'H is positively associated with the Q contentration. Heterologous expression of these genes in yeast showed that CsF3'H and CsF3'5'Ha can catalyze flavanones, fiavonols and flavanonols to the corresponding 3', 4' or 3', 4', 5'-hydroxylated compounds, for which the optimum substrate is naringenin. The enzyme of CsF3'5'Hb can only catalyze fiavonols (including K and Q) and flavanonols (DHK and DHQ), of which the highest activities in catalyzing are DHK. Interestingly, The experiment of site-directed mutagenesis suggested that two novel sites near the C-terminal were discovered impacting on the activity of the CsF3'5'H. These results provide a significantly molecular basis on the accumulation B-ring hydroxylation of flavonoids in tea plant.

AB Background: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathways play important roles in the formation of the blood vascular system and nervous system across animal phyla. We have earlier reported VEGF and FGF from Hydra vulgaris Ind-Pune, a cnidarian with a defined body axis, an organized nervous system and a remarkable ability of regeneration. We have now identified three more components of VEGF and FGF signaling pathways from hydra. These include FGF-1, FGF receptor 1 (FGFR-1) and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) with a view to deciphering their possible roles in regeneration.
   Methods: In silico analysis of proteins was performed using Clustal omega, Swiss model, MEGA 7.0, etc. Gene expression was studied by whole mount in situ hybridization. VEGF and FGF signaling was inhibited using specific pharmacological inhibitors and their effects on head regeneration were studied.
   Results: Expression patterns of the genes indicate a possible interaction between FGF-1 and FGFR-1 and also VEGF and VEGFR-2. Upon treatment of decapitated hydra with pharmacological inhibitor of FGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 for 48 h, head regeneration was delayed in treated as compared to untreated, control regenerates. When we studied the expression of head specific genes HyBra1 and HyKs1 and tentacle specific gene HyAlx in control and treated regenerates using whole mount in situ hybridization, expression of all the three genes was found to be adversely affected in treated regenerates.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that VEGF and FGF signaling play important roles in regeneration of hypostome and tentacles in hydra.

AB Genes involved in the repair of DNA damage are emerging as playing important roles during the disease processes caused by pathogenic fungi. However, there are potentially hundreds of genes involved in DNA repair in a fungus and some of those genes can play additional roles within the cell. One such gene is RAD23, required for virulence of the human pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans, that encodes a protein involved in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. However, Rad23 is a dual function protein, with a role in either repair of damaged DNA or protein turn over by directing proteins to the proteasome. Here, these two functions of Rad23 were tested by the creation of a series of domain deletion alleles of RAD23 and the assessment of the strains for DNA repair, proteasome functions, and virulence properties. Deletion of the different domains was able to uncouple the two functions of Rad23, and the phenotypes of strains carrying such forms indicated that the role of RAD23 in virulence is due to its function in proteasomal-mediated protein degradation rather than NER.

AB To improve the accuracy and genetic progress of blue fox breeding, the relationships between genetic polymorphisms and growth and reproductive traits of the blue fox were investigated. MC4R, MC3R, INHA and INHBA were selected as candidate genes for molecular evolution and statistical analyses. Single-factor variance analyses showed that the MC4R (g.267C > T, g.423C > T, and g.731C > A) and MC3R (g.677C > T) genotypes had significant impacts on body weight, chest circumference, abdominal perimeter and body mass index (BMI) (P < 0.05) in blue fox. The MC4R and MC3R combined genotypes had significant effects on the body weight and abdominal circumference. The different genotypes of INHA g.75G > A had significant effects on female fecundity, whereas the different genotypes of INHBA g.404G > T and g.467G > T and the INHA and INHBA combined genotypes had significant effects on male fecundity. The proteins encoded by the open reading frames (ORFs) of different polymorphic loci were predicted and analysed. The aims of this study were to identify genetic markers related to growth and reproduction in the blue fox and to provide an efficient, economical and accurate theoretical approach for auxiliary fox breeding.

AB The MADS-box gene family encodes transcription factors and plays an important role in plant growth and the development of flower and fruit. A perennial dioecious plant, the red bayberry genome has been published recently, providing the opportunity to analyze the MADS-box gene family and its role in fruit development and ripening. Here, we identified 54 MADS-box genes in the red bayberry genome, and classified them into two types based on phylogenetic analysis. Thirteen Type I MADS-box genes were subdivided into three subfamilies and 41 Type II MADS-box genes into 13 subfamilies. A total of 46 MADS-box genes were distributed across eight red bayberry chromosomes, and the other eight genes were located on the unmapped scaffolds. Transcriptome analysis suggested that the expression of most Type II genes was higher than Type I in five female tissues. Moreover, 26 MADS-box genes were expressed during red bayberry fruit development and ten of them showed high expression. qRT-PCR showed that the expression of MrMADS01 (SEP, MIKCc), with differences between the pale pink and red varieties, increased significantly at the final ripening stage, suggesting it may participate in ripening as positive regulator and related to anthocyanin biosynthesis. These results provide some clues for future study of MADS-box genes in red bayberry, especially in ripening process.

AB Immobilized lipases are excellent biocatalysts for the enzymatic synthesis of short-and medium-chain fatty esters used as food flavor compounds. Herein a new approach for a magnetic core-shell biocatalyst by immobilization of Candida antarctica B lipase is reported, coating single-core magnetic nanoparticles with an organic shell, preferably poly(benzofurane-co-arylacetic acid), followed by the covalent attachment of the enzyme and embedment of the primary biocatalyst in a silica layer. Although covalent and sol-gel immobilization were efficient on their own, their combination can ensure additional operational stability through multi-point linkages. Moreover, silanes holding glycidoxy groups, which can also form covalent linkages, have been successfully used as precursors for the silica coating layer. The structural, magnetic and morphological characteristics were assessed by TEM, SEM-EDX, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometry. The new biocatalysts demonstrated high catalytic efficiency in the solventless synthesis of isoamyl esters of natural carboxylic acids, also in multiple reaction cycles.

AB Z-lycopene isomers are more bioavailable than all-E-lycopene, especially 5-Z-lycopene. Based on our observations, the addition of unblanched onion could favor Z-isomerization of lycopene (by more than 94%) during heating tomato-onion-extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) purees at 90 degrees C for 2 h. The increase in Z-lycopene was correlated linearly with the addition of unblanched onion, with R-2 > 0.92, and increased rates of 5-Z-lycopene were 3-4 times higher than for 9-Z-lycopene and 13-Z-lycopene. Diallyl disulfide (DADS), formed by alliinase-catalyzed breakdown of non-volatile precursors in onion, contributed to these increases and correlated linearly (R-2 > 0.79, 0-0.50 mg/g puree) with increased Z-lycopene. Increased rates of 5-Z-lycopene were also 3-4 times higher than for 9-Z-lycopene and 13-Z-lycopene. However, blanching of onion, in tomato-onion-EVOO purees, before heating, significantly decreased the effect of onion on Z-isomerization of lycopene.

AB The aim of the present study is to encapsulate structured lipids (SLs) by complex coacervation of gelatin and gum arabic with or without using transglutaminase enzymes and to develop a functional kefir product via the addition of encapsulated SLs in the form of suspension and freeze-dried coacervates. Encapsulated SLs were evaluated for their oxidative stability during 30 days of cold storage. The data showed that coacervate solutions were more sensitive to lipid oxidation compared to freeze-dried capsules. Traditionally produced kefir samples that were fortified with complex coacervation products were stored for 10 days at 4 degrees C. The pH values of the samples decreased, whereas titratable acidity consistently increased during the storage period. Moreover, an in vitro controlled release study was conducted with a fortified kefir sample containing freeze-dried capsules. According to the results, kefir had no significant matrix effect on oil release from the freeze-dried capsules (p > 0.05).

The results showed that C. sakazakii on non-fat dry milk (NFDM), wheat flour, and egg white powder were significantly inactivated by 5.27, 4.92, and 5.30 log(10) CFU/g, respectively, after 3 or 4 passes of IPL treatments. For decontamination of E. faecium, 3-4 passes of IPL treatments reduced the E. faecium level on NFDM, wheat flour, and egg white by 3.67, 2.79, 2.74 log(10) CFU/g, respectively. These results demonstrated that the enhanced microbiological inactivation can be achieved using this vibratory-assisted IPL system after multiple passes.

AB Eggs are staple food in the human diet and are consumed globally. They represent a complete food required for well-being and are recognized by consumers as versatile and wholesome with a balance of essential nutrients. However, eggs are perishable and susceptible to contamination with certain microorganisms. Past studies concluded that edible coatings have been successful to maintain the interior quality and reduce the microbial load on the eggshell surface. This paper provides an overview of the egg quality and safety and discusses the application of various types of lipid-, polysaccharide-, and protein-based edible coating systems on eggs. Edible coatings could be a viable alternative to existing techniques for maintaining the internal quality and safety of fresh eggs during long-term storage.

AB Gallotannin 1,2,6-tri-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucopyranose (1,2,6-TGGP) plays multiple roles against multidrug-resistant bacteria and other diseases. Nevertheless, its availability in tea (Camellia sinensis) has rarely been reported. Herein, the identification and verification of 1,2,6-TGGP from Camellia sinensis using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-qTOF MS/MS), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were reported. The isolated 1,2,6-TGGP was used for the chemotaxonomy analysis of 17 tea cultivars. The contents of 1,2,6-TGGP ranged from 1.96 to 43.20 mg g(-1), with a mean of 13.75 mg g(-1). Relatively high 1,2,6-TGGP contents (> 30 mg g(-1)) in two tea cultivars indicate that the beneficial effects of 1,2,6-TGGP can be obtained by consuming these teas. The chemotaxonomy analysis showed a biosynthetic relation between 1,2,6-TGGP and gallic acid. Further analysis showed that the 1,2,6-TGGP contents significantly decreased with the plucking times irrespective of the cultivars. Moreover, a positive and significant correlation was also observed between 1,2,6-TGGP and gallic acid. The identification of tea cultivars that are rich in 1,2,6-TGGP was first reported and the obtained results should boost their potential use in food and medicine.

AB The redfleshed pulp discarded from pink guava puree industry is a rich source of lycopene and pectin. In this study, we developed a facile extraction process employing water as the primary extraction medium to isolate the lycopene and pectin from pink guava decanter. When the decanter was suspended in water, the complexation of lycopene and pectin formed the cloudy solution, where the colloidal complexes were recovered through centrifugation. The presence of lycopene and pectin in the complex was confirmed by the spectroscopic, microscopic and chromatographic analyses. The lycopene fractionated from the complexes had a purity level of 99% and was in all-trans configuration. The colloidal complexes yielding the highest concentration of lycopene was obtained at pH 7, 1% (w/v) solid loading and 25 degrees C. The experimental data of time-course extraction of lycopene-pectin complex were best fitted with two-site kinetic model, hinting the fast-and slow-release phases in the extraction process.

AB Autophagy, a mechanism of recycling intracellular constituents, favors plant growth, especially under nutrient starvation. However, autophagy's role in regulating postharvest fruit senescence is unclear. Here, effects of the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and activator LiCl on postharvest jujube fruit senescence were investigated. HCQ significantly reduced weight loss and decay incidence, and enhanced firmness compared with those of the control. LiCl had the opposite effects. Protein oxidation and H2O2 increased significantly in LiCl-treated compared with HCQ-treated fruit. The contents of vitamin C, total thiol, and phenolics, and total antioxidant capacity and DPPH-radical scavenging capacity, followed the order: HCQ > control > LiCl. The HCQ-mediated reduction in fruit respiration was significantly enhanced by ATP and partly reversed by 2,4-dinitrophenol, a mitochondrial uncoupler. Thus, jujube fruit senescence may be regulated by autophagy and the antioxidant capacity. A mechanism of autophagy-mediated postharvest fruit senescence involving mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration was proposed.

AB A Chinese-style sausage was processed using pork as the raw material. During the whole process, 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (9-HODE), 9,10-dihydroxyoctadecenoic acid (9,10-DHODE) and 9,10,13-trihydroxyoctadecenoic acid (9,10,13-THODE) kept increasing. All of them were found to be correlated negatively and significantly with lipoxygenases (LOX) activity, and positively and significantly with peroxide value (POV) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). The ratio of 13-HODE to 9-HODE decreased slowly during drying stage and stayed higher than 2 during the whole process, and it was found to be positively and significantly with LOX activity. The ratio of variation of 13-HODE to variation of 9-HODE in every sampling period (the ratio of Delta 13-HODE to Delta 9-HODE) decreased sharply from 2.75 in the stage of curing for 12 h to 1.37 in the stage drying from 24 d to 30 d. The changes of ratio of 13HODE to 9-HODE and ratio of Delta 13-HODE to Delta 9-HODE indicated LOX-catalyzed oxidation predominated in curing and early drying stages, and such predominance was taken over by non-enzymatic oxidation during late drying stage; LOX-catalyzed oxidation was the major contributor to lipids oxidation during the whole process of the Chinese-style sausage preparing.

AB Volatile compounds and non-phenolic metabolites (amino acids, organic acids, and sugars) of aqueous green tea extracts obtained by ultrasonic extraction (UE), agitation extraction (AE), hot water extraction (HWE), and conventional extraction (CE) were determined using SPME-GC-MS and HPLC, respectively. Significantly higher (P < 0.05) yields of volatiles and non-phenolic metabolites were obtained via UE and AE than via HWE and CE. UE, AE, HWE, and CE released 212, 201, 103, and 65 volatiles, respectively. Sum total of amino acid and organic acid in extracts was 54.57, 54.35, 27.11, and 12.67 (mg/100 g), and 5.96, 6.19, 3.81, and 1.68 (mg/100 g) for UE, AE, HWE, and CE, respectively. Volatiles except nitrogen-containing compounds had higher positive correlations with L-theanine, sucrose, malic acid, and catechins yields. Findings of the current study suggest that an efficient extraction technique may significantly increase volatile and non-phenolic metabolite yields in aqueous green tea extract.

AB Natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) have been growing interest as an alternative to the traditional organic solvents. They not only have the merit of high efficiency but also have the possibility to readily applicable to pharmaceutical and food applications. In the present study, NADES with high-speed homogenization and cavitation-burst extraction (HSH-CBE) was performed on fresh mulberry for anthocyanins extraction. The extraction conditions were statistically investigated by Plackett-Burman design (PBD) and Box-Behnken design (BBD). The optimal conditions were obtained as follows: chloride-citric acid-glucose formed a NADES with the mole ratio of 1:1:1, 30% water content, liquid-solid ratio 22 mL/g, homogenization time 60 s, homogenization speed 12,000 rpm, extraction time 30 min, negative pressure -0.08 MPa and extraction two times. The total maximum extraction of anthocyanins reached 6.05 mg/g fresh weight, which was 1.24 folds to those by the traditional organic solvents extraction. Moreover, NADES exhibited higher stability of anthocyanins extraction than traditional organic solvents, which was benefit for the analysis and preservation of anthocyanins. Consequently, this result revealed that the developed method could be taken as a sustainable, green and effective approach for anthocyanins extraction.

AB Microgreens are an emerging class of vegetables, which have become increasingly important in the agri-food market in recent years, and contain a number of macro- and micro-nutrients. This paper presents a rapid method for the elemental analysis of microgreens based on total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) spectroscopy, without preliminary sample digestion.
   The following elements were detected and quantified simultaneously for six microgreen genotypes, belonging to Asteraceae and Brassicaceae: P, S, K, Ca, Cl, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br, Rb, Sr. The limit of detection (LOD) varied depending on the element and ranged between 0.1 mg kg(-1) for Sr and 42 mg kg(-1) for P.
   The method was validated using certified standards, and results compared with those obtained using a conventional ICP-AES method requiring sample digestion. The paper also presents the advantages and disadvantages of the two techniques.

AB The potential synergistic effects of Flavan-3-ols to inhibit the formation of acrylamide have attracted wide attention. This study aims to investigate the synergistic inhibitory effects of the B-type procyanidin and flavan-3-ols monomer on acrylamide production in food matrix. By comparing the inhibitory effects of different compounds in food matrix, procyanidin B-2 and catechin were screened out for examining their synergistic inhibitory effects on acrylamide by Isobologram analysis. When the interaction index (gamma) was lower than 1, the interaction was synergistic reaction. The results showed the procyanidin B-2/catechin ratio of 1:3 (gamma = 0.57) had similar synergistic effect to that of 1:9 (gamma = 0.53), both of which showed better effects than the ratio of 1:1 (gamma = 0.71). The optimal synergistic inhibitory effect (70.11 +/- 2.07%) was achieved when the procyanidin B2 and catechin concentrations were 0.6 mu g/mL and 5.4 mu g/mL, respectively. Compared with single use, the combined use of B2 and catechin could decrease the dosage of B-2 to 1/10 and that of catechin to 1/3.

AB The effects of the addition of edible gums (xanthan gum (XG), flaxseed gum (FG), konjac glucomannan (KGM) or tamarind seed gum (TSG)) on texture, gelatinisation and retrogradation of selected starches were investigated. XG and KGM significantly (p < 0.05) reduced syneresis of rich starch gels, from 62.5% to 13.1% and 62.5% to 21.2%, respectively. Moreover, the addition of gums resulted in softer binary gels, the hardness of lotus root starch was reduced from 39.07 to 14.08 g with the increase in XG content. Additionally, FG and TSG significantly increased the peak viscosity of mung bean starch (MBS) gels from 4372 to 10,285 cp. This facilitated the use of MBS gels as thickeners in foods. Binary gels improved the heat stability of starch gels, thus, widening its application in the preparation of baked foods. Binary gels could be used as additives in food production to improve the overall quality of foods.

AB The structure of the ellagitannin (ET) with a molecular weight (MW) of 2038 isolated from strawberry fruit was elucidated on the basis of mass spectrometry data and nuclear magnetic resonance studies, with the newly determined compound being named fragariin A. Similarly to the main strawberry ET, agrimoniin (MW 1870), fragariin A was shown to contain a bis-HHDP-glucose moiety (MW 784). It exhibited the same three fragmentation ions with m/z 1567, 1265 and 633, arising from the detachment of consecutive hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP) units from the structure with MW 1870. Based on spectroscopic studies, it was found that, in the tested ET (MW 2038), a free gallic acid is connected by a DOG-type bond to the 4,6-HHDP unit of the second glucose moiety of agrimoniin.

AB Oca (Oxalis tuberosa) is an underutilized species and represents a novel starch source. Composition and structure of starches from tubers of two commercial oca varieties grown in New Zealand were compared to those of normal maize and potato starches. The phosphorus content of oca starch was similar to 60% of that of potato starch. The amylose content of oca starch (similar to 21%) was lower than that of maize and potato starches (concanavalin A precipitation method). The fine structure of oca amylopectin was much more similar to that of potato amylopectin than to that of maize amylopectin. Oca amylopectin had a shorter internal chain length and less fingerprint B-chains than potato amylopectin. The two oca starches were structurally and compositionally similar. Oca starch granules had a volume moment mean size of 34.5 mu m and B-type polymorph. Comparative analysis suggested that oca starch has the potential to be developed as a novel starch source.

AB Phospholipids (PL) rich in conjugated linolenic acid (CLA) have important health effects. Yields of phosphatidylcholine (PC) acidolysis with CLA use to be limited to < 30%, due to competitive side-hydrolysis. Duolite A658-Lecitase is a very suitable biocatalyst for this reaction.
   In this study, PC hydrolysis has been practically eliminated using extremely dried lyophilized PC (279 +/- 4 mg water/Kg PC), obtaining close to 100% molar yield of modified PC (72.3% CLA) with Duolite-Lecitase in 24 h, the highest yield reported in the literature for this reaction. It has been better improved by changing the immobilization support, using three food grade hydrophobic supports (Styrene, and two Octadecyl methacrylates (OM and OMC)). In only 2 h, with a 1/12 PC/CLA molar ratio at 50 degrees C, similar almost quantitative yields of PC with 74.4% CLA content has been obtained using OM-Lecitase. The fatty acid composition of modified PCs is not affected by the enzyme immobilization protocol.

AB Spontaneous fermentation is a critical step in the processing of high-quality fish sauce. In this study, a comparative UHPLC-Q/TOF-MS-based metabolomics approach combining equivalent-quantification and the taste activity value (TAV) was used, for the first time, to evaluate the taste qualities and characterize metabolite profiles in Chinese fish sauce during fermentation. A total of 22,816 metabolite ion features were extracted from fish sauce samples. Forty-six metabolites, including amino acids, small peptides, organic acids, amines, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids, were identified as key chemical components of fish sauce. In addition, absolute quantification and TAV showed that aspartic acid and glutamic acid exert an important influence on the umami taste of fish sauce. Specific metabolites were primarily associated with amino acid metabolism, particularly alterations in arginine and proline metabolism. This study identifies chemical components and provides novel insights into the taste quality of fish sauce due to fermentation.

AB Little data are available on the impact of pomace pre-treatment, notably drying, on the nature and yield of polyphenols. Pomace from two apple varieties ('Avrolles' and 'Kermerrien'), pressed with and without oxidation, were air-dried to different degrees. Drying led to the loss of native molecules, notably 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid and flavan-3-ols. Total polyphenol yields, after sequential pressurized liquid extraction (water 10 MPa, 70 degrees C, then ethanol 48%, 10 MPa, 70 degrees C), varied between 5 and 15 g/ kg dry weight but showed no marked trend with drying. Extracts from dried pomace contained few native polyphenols. Water extracts from 'Kermerrien' contained flavonols, flavanols and phloridzin and those from 'Avrolles' contained phloridzin. Water: ethanol extracts were rich in procyanidins, especially from 'Avrolles', where they represented > 80% of analysable polyphenols. Presence of polyphenol molecules with modified structures in the extracts of dried pomaces might lead to different biological properties than those with native molecules.

AB Sea fennel is an herbaceous aromatic and edible halophyte, naturally occurring in coastal areas of the Mediterranean basin. Besides its scientific interest as a salt-tolerant species it exhibits considerable nutritional value and economical potential. As sea fennel is distributed in maritime areas, where natural iodine is available in high concentrations, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether sea fennel has the potential to accumulate elevated iodine concentrations under cultivation. A biofortification experiment in a hydroponic system applying two forms of iodine, KI and KIO3 in different concentrations was set up and monitored using sophisticated targeted elementary and metabolite analysis. The biofortification potential and possible effects on nutritional value were investigated. This study revealed that both iodine forms increased the iodine content of sea fennel tissues. Nutritional and health promoting components, biomass production but also antioxidant potential were stable or even improved under the iodine treatments.

AB Vitamin E is a family of related compounds with different vitamin E activities and antioxidant properties that includes tocopherols, tocotrienols and plastochromanol-8. Plant oils could serve as an industrial source not only of tocopherols, but also tocotrienols and plastochromanol-8, which exhibit much stronger antioxidant activities than tocopherols. The aim of this study was a quantitative and qualitative analysis of vitamin E in certain plant oils. We demonstrated the presence of vitamin E derivatives in all the plant oils tested. The highest tocopherol contents were in pomegranate, wheat germ and raspberry seed oils. In general, gamma-tocopherol was the predominant tocopherol homologue. Tocotrienols were also identified in most of the oils, but their content was much lower. The highest concentration of tocotrienols was in coriander seed oil. Plastochromanol-8 was present in most of the oils, but wheat germ oil was the richest source.

AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of widespread and diverse endogenous RNAs, have been identified as critical regulators of various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the specific roles of circRNAs in HCC are largely unknown. In this study, we identified a novel circRNA, circ-IGF1R, in HCC tumour tissues and cell lines. Circ-IGF1R levels were found to be significantly upregulated in HCC tissues compared with levels in paired peritumoural tissues. The high expression levels of circ-IGF1R in HCC were associated with tumour size. Moreover, knocking down circ-IGF1R with siRNA significantly attenuated cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in vitro. Further investigation revealed that PI3K/AKT signalling pathway activation was involved in the oncogenic functions of circ-IGF1R in HCC. Our study suggests that circ-IGF1R may be a potential target for the prevention and treatment of HCC.

AB Oral squamous cell cancer (OSCC) is one of the causes of death worldwide. The purpose of this project was to define the restoring of microRNA-143 in HN-5 cells and discover molecular apparatuses responsible for the anticancer processes. Firstly, expression levels of miR-143, K-Ras, MMP9 and C-Myc were evaluated in OSCC tissues. Then, microRNA-143 was transfected into HN-5 cells. The cytotoxic effects of microRNA-143 on HN-5 cells were evaluated. To estimate the effects of microRNA-143 on cell migration, wound healing assay was done. The expression levels of microRNA-143, K-Ras, MMP9, C-Myc, ADAMTS and CXCR4 were evaluated via the qRTPCR method. microRNA-143 mimic inhibited cell migration in HN-5 cell line. microRNA-143 mimic decreased K-Ras, MMP9, C-My, ADAMTS and CXCR4 gene expression. microRNA-143 can inhibit HN-5 cells migration in vitro by down-regulating the expression of invasion-linked genes. Hence, microRNA-143 can be a new diagnostic biomarker and new therapeutic target for OSCC.

AB Drug resistance of malaria parasites remains a problem affecting antimalarial treatment and control of the disease. We previously synthesized an antimalarial endoperoxide, N-89, having high antimalarial effects in vitro and in vivo. In this study we seek to understand the resistant mechanism against N-89 by establishing a highly N-89-resistant clone, named NRC10H, of the Plasmodium falciparum FCR-3 strain. We describe gene mutations in the parent FCR-3 strain and the NRC10H clone using whole-genome sequencing and subsequently by expression profiling using quantitative real-time PCR. Seven genes related to drug resistance, proteolysis, glycopho-sphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis, and phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis exhibited a single amino acid substitution in the NRC10H clone. Among these seven genes, the multidrug resistance protein 2 (mdr2) variant A532S was found only in NRC10H. The genetic status of the P. falciparum endoplasmic reticulum-resident calcium binding protein (PfERC), a potential target of N-89, was similar between the NRC10H clone and the parent FCR-3 strain. These findings suggest that the genetic alterations of the identified seven genes, in particular mdr2, in NRC10H could give rise to resistance of the antimalarial endoperoxide N-89.

ID METHYLENETETRAHYDROFOLATE; METABOLISM; GLYCINE
AB Mitochondrial folate metabolism is central to the generation of nucleotides, fuelling methylation reactions, and redox homeostasis. Uniquely among the reactions of the mitochondrial folate pathway, the key step of the oxidation of 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate (CH2-THF) can be catalysed by two isozymes, MTHFD2 and MTHFD2L. The MTHFD2 enzyme has recently received considerable attention as an oncogenic enzyme upregulated in several tumour types, which is additionally required by cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. However, much less is currently known about MTHFD2L and its expression in cancer. In this study, we examine and compare the expression and regulation of the two mitochondrial MTHFD isozymes in normal human and cancer cells. We found that normal and cancer cells express both enzymes, although MTHFD2 has a much higher baseline expression. Unlike MTHFD2, the MTHFD2L isozyme does not show an association with proliferation and growth factor stimulation. In addition, we did not find evidence of a compensatory increase of MTHFD2L following suppression of its isozyme. This study supports that MTHFD2L is unlikely to have an important function in increased proliferation or cancer. Furthermore, therapeutic strategies aiming to block the mitochondrial folate pathway in cancer should focus on MTHFD2, with MTHFD2L being unlikely to be involved in the development of chemoresistance to targeting of its mitochondrial isozyme.

AB Nebulin is a 770 kDa protein that is localized along the thin filaments of skeletal muscles in vertebrates. It is also present in the striated muscles of Amphioxus, an invertebrate cephalochordate that is phylogenetically close to vertebrates. However, the nebulin of urochordate ascidians or its expression in invertebrate hearts has not been investigated. In this study, we investigated the structure and cardiac expression of the nebulin gene in Ciona intestinalis, a urochordate whose phylogeny lies between cephalochordates and vertebrates. As a result of the gene structure analysis, we found that the Ciona nebulin gene predicted to be 62 kb and consists of 143 exons. The nebulin was expected to consist of a unique N-terminal region, followed by 155 nebulin repeats, another unique region, a Ser-rich region and a C-terminal SH3 domain. Whole-mount in situ hybridization experiments showed that the Ciona nebulin gene was expressed in a variety of muscles, including hearts. However, Western blot analysis using antibody to Ciona nebulin did not detect the presence of full-length nebulin. Alternatively, RT-PCR experiments on samples of Ciona heart detected the expression of nebulette-like and nrap-like isoforms from the Ciona nebulin gene. These results indicate that, similarly to vertebrate hearts, Ciona hearts do not express nebulin, but rather nrap- and nebulette-like isoforms. These results also imply that the nebulin, nebulette and nrap genes in vertebrates were separated from an ancestral invertebrate nebulin gene during vertebrate evolution.

TI Genetic mutation analysis of the COQ2 gene in Italian patients with
   multiple system atrophy
SO GENE
LA English
DT Letter
DE COQ2; MSA; Multiple system atrophy
AB COQ2 encodes para-hydroxybenzoate-polyprenyl transferase and, recently, mutations in this gene have been associated with the increase of the risk of multiple system atrophy (MSA) in Japanese cases. Subsequently, studies in Asian patients confirmed the role of COQ2 in the development of MSA, while other analysis failed to replicate these results in Caucasian population. We performed genetics screening of COQ2 in 100 MSA Italian patients. We did not find any pathogenic mutations; our results suggest that COQ2 is not a genetic risk factor for MSA in Italian population.

AB Background: Outcome in adjuvant chemotherapy of gastric cancer (GC) has considerable stage-independent variability, which underscores the need for prognostic or predictive molecular markers. CHAF1A promotes tumor growth while its impact on chemotherapy outcome remains unknown.
   Methods: CHAF1A protein expression was measured in independent discovery and validation sets that included 86 and 325 patients respectively who received fluoropyrimidines-based adjuvant chemotherapy after radical gastrectomy. The chemosensitizing effect of CHAF1A knockdown was investigated in vitro. Bioinformatics analysis based on RNA-seq and proteome data from public database was performed to investigate the potential mechanisms and further validation was conducted.
   Results: In both the discovery and validation sets, CHAF1A expression level was an independent predictor for disease-free survival (HR = 4.25; 95% CI: 2.31-7.79; P < 0.001; and HR = 1.91; 95% CI: 1.03-3.54; P = 0.039, respectively) and overall survival (HR = 3.25; 95% CI: 1.75-6.05; P < 0.001; and HR = 2.42; 95% CI: 1.12-5.20; P = 0.024, respectively) in patients with non-cardia GC but not in those with cardia GC. In GC cells, CHAFIA knockdown significantly decreased the IC50 of 5-FU. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that CHAF1A correlated with folate metabolism and the expression of thymidylate synthetase (TS). Furthermore, CHAFIA knockdown significantly reduced TS expression in GC cells and CHAF1A positively correlated with TS protein expression in tumor tissues. Finally, ten proteins potentially relevant to the regulation of TS expression by CHAF1A were identified using online tools based on RNA-seq and proteome data.
   Conclusions: CHAF1A may impact adjuvant chemotherapy outcome of GC by regulating the expression of TS.

AB Alternative splicing can generate multiple protein messages from a single gene and has emerged as an important mechanism to regulate cancer pathways. The human SAT1 gene produces two transcript variants: one translates spermidine/spermine N-1 acetyltransferase (SSAT1), the rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of polyamines, and the other generates SSATX, which has largely unknown biological functions. Here, we used experimental data and analyses of several melanoma transcriptome datasets to reveal that SSATX is weakly expressed in melanoma cells. SSATX knockdown promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of human melanoma cells via the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway in a manner that was independent of SSAT1 expression. Based on our data, we propose that SSATX functions as a long non-coding RNA prior to its degradation in melanoma cells. Overall, our findings indicate that SSATX acts as a tumor suppressor, which may aid the future diagnosis and treatment of melanoma.

AB The young leaves generally accumulate a certain concentration anthocyanins in the dominant species of the subtropical forest, and the changes of anthocyanin synthesis-related enzyme genes expression levels had an important effect on the study photoprotection of anthocyanins in the young leaves of subtropical forests. The determination of anthocyanin synthesis-related enzyme gene sequences and the selection of appropriate reference genes provide a basis for analyzing the functional properties of anthocyanins. In this study, four dominant subtropical forest species (i.e., Schima superba, Castanopsis fissa, Acmena acuminatissima, Cryptocarya concinna) were taken as materials. To obtain the correct nucleotide sequences of anthocyanin-related enzymes, the nucleotide sequences of CHS, DFR and ANS in each dominant species were obtained by sequencing and comparison. Then, to select the most stable reference genes for leaves at different developmental stages and different light conditions, the expression levels of six reference genes, including 18S, Actin, GAPDH, TUB, EF1 and UBQ, were studied by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), and reference gene stability was analyzed by GeNorm and NormFinder software. The results showed that the expression level of Actin was the most stable in S. superba, A. acuminatissima and C. continua, and the expression level of GAPDH was the most stable in C. fissa. Finally, the expression levels of the anthocyanin synthesis genes CHS, DFR and ANS were analyzed and found to be consistent with the accumulation trend of anthocyanins in leaves. This study has important theoretical and practical significance for future research into the expression of anthocyanin synthesis-related enzyme genes in the dominant tree species in subtropical forests and reveals that anthocyanin has a photoprotective effect for young leaves in high-light environments.

AB Background: Existing meta-analysis have shown that the miR-200 family can be taken as a prognostic biomarker for many tumors. However, great heterogeneity was shown in predicting overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Emerging studies indicate that the expression levels of members of the miR-200 family are tissue-specific among various tumor tissues, which may be the main reason of the heterogeneity in predicting survival prognosis of tumor patients with the miR-200 family as biomarkers. By further analysis of heterogeneity of the miR-200 family as a biomarker for predicting survival prognosis of patients with different tumors, we expected to provide an accurate basis for the clinical application of the miR-200 family to predict the prognosis of patients with different tumors.
   Methods: Eligible published studies were identified by searching the databases of PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. The clinical data of patients in the studies were pooled, and pooled hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were used to calculate the strength of this association. The expressions of miRNAs were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We presented the expressions of each member in miR-200 family in 15 types of cancer by boxplot, and analyzed the correlation among the members of miR-200 family by Spearman method. Different subgroup analyses were then performed based on the correlation among the members of miR-200 family, and the publication bias was assessed using the funnel plot of the Egger bias indicator test.
   Results: Of 36 articles, including 15 tumor types and 4644 patients were included to perform meta-analysis. It was found that miR-200 family members can be used as independent protective factors in patients with various tumors but the miR-200 family has a higher heterogeneity in predicting prognosis: OS (HR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-1.03, I-2 = 85%, P < 0.01) and PFS (HR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.57-1.16, I-2 = 97%, P < 0.01). The data from TCGA database were used to analyze the expression levels of the miR-200 family and the results showed that the expression of miR-429 in different cancers is very different, and there are significant differences in expression levels compared with other miR-200 family members; the expression levels of miR-200a and miR-200b in various tumor tissues were similar to each other, respectively; miR-200c and miR-141 showed similar expression levels in each of most types of cancer tissues except ovarian cancer (OC). The expression levels of members of the miR-200 family in breast cancer (BRCA), cervical cancer (CESC), colon cancer (LOAD), esophageal cancer (ESCA), head and neck cancer (HNSC), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) are relatively stable, but great variations can be found in the expression levels of miR-200 family members in ovarian cancer (OC), liver cancer (LIHC), renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP). Cluster analysis of expression of target genes of miR-200 family in different cancers yielded similar results to the expression level of the miR-200 family. Subgroup analysis of OC, LIHC, GC and LUAD based on expression levels and clustering results reduced or even eliminated the heterogeneity of miR-200 family members in predicting patient outcomes.
   Conclusions: Our results convincingly demonstrated that the miR-200 family could serve as a prognostic biomarker for cancers mentioned above and has potential value in clinical practice. MiR-200 family as prognostic biomarkers needs to be performed according to different tumor tissues and correlation between members in miR-200 family.

Late Jurassic onward, the fragmentation of east Gondwana and the separation of India from its erstwhile neighbors triggered the formation of the eastern and western coastlines of the Indian landmass. With time, the craton-margin rifts turned into passive margins as the Indian plate took a long northward drift. The northward movement of India is accommodated by subduction of 4000-7000 km of the Neotethys ocean crust leading to diachronous collision of the landmass first with Kohistan- Ladakh arc and then with Tibet. The Tethyan basins in Kashmir, Lahul and Spiti offer an opportunity to study the nature of deposition at the Neotethys ocean margin. With the continuing convergence of subducting plate and emplacement of Himalaya-Tibet fold-thrust belt, the flexural buckling of the Indian lithosphere resulted in the formation of foreland basins with varying dimension and character in conjunction with the evolution of the Himalayan fold-thrust system. In post-Oligocene, three mighty rivers viz. Indus, Ganges and Brahmaputra drained the foreland and formed large-scale submarine fan systems in the oceans surrounding the Indian sub-continent.

AB The unfossiliferous Chaung Magyi Group of the Northern Shan Plateau of Myanmar, comprises metasedimentary rocks, in particular greywacke, slates, phyllites and schists, of inferred Proterozoic age that unconformably underlie the late Cambrian Pangyun Formation. To address the problem of the youngest stratigraphic extent of the group, four samples of the Chaung Magyi Group from the Yeywa Dome, East of Kyaukse, Mandalay Division, were collected for U-Pb dating of detrital zircons. Based on the youngest detrital zircons present in sandstone samples from the western Yeywa Dome area, at least the upper part of the Chaung Magyi Group is of latest Proterozoic age and possibly extends to the late Cambrian (similar to 500 Ma). Comparison of detrital zircon age-frequency histogram distributions show only slight differences in distributions of detrital zircons in the Cambrian of NW Thailand and the Chaung Magyi Group samples (Sibumasu Terrane), with a concentration of ages between 1300 Ma and 820 Ma, with two major peaks at 1086 Ma and 1022 Ma. A younger Cryogenian age peak at 647 Ma is also observed. A spread of older concordant ages ranges from 3093 Ma to 1406 Ma. The minimum depositional age for the Chaung Magyi Group of the west of the Bawdwin Mine (982 Ma) based on ages of cross-cutting dykes (reported in Mitchell, 2018), and the maximum depositional age for Yeywa Dome (similar to 600-500 Ma) based on detrital zircons suggest the age difference (similar to > 400 my) is too great for the Chaung Magyi Group to be considered a single group, the dyke ages require re-investigation.

AB We present a Pn wave velocity and anisotropy model of the central segment of the North-South Seismic Belt in China, where there are numerous stable basins and active faults, making this segment attractive for extensive studies. The model was obtained by a tomographic analysis of 49,973 Pn wave phase readings collected by the China Earthquake Networks Center and temporary stations in Yunnan and Sichuan. The tomographic velocity model shows that the average Pn wave velocity is 8.06 km/s; prominent high-velocity (high-V) anomalies are visible under the Sichuan Basin, the Zoige Basin and the Ordos block, which clearly outline their tectonic margins. A pronounced low-velocity (low-V) zone is observed from the Songpan-Ganzi block to the Chuan-Dian and Daliangshan blocks, suggesting the presence of hot material upwelling. The station delay data show a gradual variation from negative to positive values, possibly reflecting a crustal thickness variation from the southwest to the northeast of the study area. A correlation between the Pn wave anisotropy and the distribution of velocity anomalies is observed: anisotropy is relatively weaker in the high-V anomaly zones beneath stable basins, while it is stronger in the low-V anomaly zones and the high-to-low-V anomaly transition zones. The high-resolution velocity and anisotropy tomographic model that we obtained could also provide a better understanding of the study area seismicity, since the occurrence of strong earthquakes seems to be related to the presence and strength of lateral heterogeneities at the uppermost mantle level.

AB In this paper, data of gravimetry, aeromagnetic survey, and surface heat flow are utilized in a combined manner to investigate the crustal thickness, Curie surface, and lithospheric thermal state beneath the Junggar Basin and adjacent Mountain Ranges. The Moho depth, Curie depth, and thermal lithospheric thickness are found to be 38-52 km, 32-50 km, and 120-260 km, respectively. The Moho and Curie surface present a rough inverse correspondence between each other. In the Tianshan and Altai Mountain Ranges, Moho interface is deep but Curie surface is shallow. In the Junggar Basin, Turpan Basin, and Yili Basin, the situation is in reverse. The uppermost mantle in the Central Depression and Eastern Uplift of the Junggar Basin, the Turpan Basin, the Yili Basin, as well as the north-west area off Fuhai is investigated to have been magnetized. The aeromagnetic anomalies and the Curie surface in the Junggar Basin surprisingly reveal that the northward subduction of the north Tarim block/slab under the Junggar Basin accompanied by the uplift of the Tianshan Mountain Range. Also, in response to the northward movement, the rigid Central Depression of the Junggar Basin extruded from its east and west sides. The westward extrusion is manifested by the West Uplift of the western Junggar Mountain Range.

AB The Langshan-Zhaertai ore belt in northern China includes a dozen sediment-hosted Zn-Pb-Cu deposits, which are traditionally considered to have been formed during sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX) activities in different subbasins in the same Proterozoic marginal rift system. However, this assumption has never been systematically tested. Herein, we re-evaluate the regional metallogeny by the analysis and comparison of Pb isotope data obtained in this study and published in literatures. The Pb isotope signatures of several representative deposits from this ore belt are heterogeneous and do not lie along similar secondary or anomalous lead evolution lines, suggesting that these deposits belong to different metallogenic systems. The Pb isotope ratios of the bulk of the sulfide ores in south ore belt are characterized by unradiogenic isotope compositions and Proterozoic Pb-Pb model ages, whereas the various types of sulfides from the Huogeqi deposit in north ore belt show a very radiogenic lead signature ((206)pb/Pb-204 > 17.000), which is broadly consistent with common lead of associated Indosinian magmatic rocks, indicating an magmatic-hydrothermal origin. The Dongshengmiao and Tanyaokou massive-type ore sulfides have similar and exceedingly unradiogenic isotope compositions grouped around 15.200 ((206)pb/Pb-204) Their vein-type sulfides show scattered Pb isotope signatures that fall along a well-cor- related linear trend towards the right of the massive-sulfide array, indicating some modification during metamorphism. The similarity of lead isotope compositions of the Jiashengpan vein-type sulfides to the common lead of Hercynian igneous rocks indicates that the proximal source of the ore metals in its epigenetic hydrothermal system was Hercynian igneous activity.

AB Bulk chemical composition and mineral composition of the Pliocene sediments in southwest Japan reveal the effects of source rock compositions and grain sizes, as well as the relationship between sedimentary environments and the degree of chemical weathering in the Pliocene warm period. A wide variation in the degree of chemical weathering, source rock compositions and grain sizes was observed with vertical and spatial changes in the sedimentary environment. Coarse-grained sediments, deposited in sandy channels and their floodplains, indicate a lower but wide range of CIA values. This result suggests that the degree of chemical weathering can be modified by changes in grain size due to hydrologic processes. In contrast, stagnant water sediments, composed of homogeneous fine-grained sediments, display a wide variety of REE compositions and Al2O3/SiO2 ratios mainly caused by variation in source rock compositions and grain sizes. However, the CIA values of the stagnant water sediments are over 90, such that these sediments display a tight cluster near the Al2O3 apex on the Al2O3-(CaO + Na2O)-K2O ternary diagram. This study demonstrates CIA values are generally above 90, which is due to the increased leaching of Ca, Na, and K with exposure to under intense chemical weathering conditions even if the source rocks and grain sizes are variable. Regardless of the wide variety of source rock compositions and grain sizes, REE and kaolinite-rich clay mineral concentrations in these sediments are indicative of the intense weathering conditions that prevailed in the Pliocene period (3-4 Ma) in southwest Japan.

AB Granite is the most important magmatic product during continental accretion and reworking, and is widely distributed at convergent margins. However, the formation of intracontinental granitic rocks remains unclear. The Early Paleozoic Wuyi-Yunkai orogen in southeast China is widely accepted as an intracontinental collision belt and has attracted significant attention in recent decades. Nevertheless, the tectonic driving mechanism for the formation of these granitic rocks is still puzzling. Integrating available data, we conclude that the Ordovician-Devonian granitic rocks in southeast China formed during the period from 452 Ma to 381 Ma, yielding an age peak at around 450-430 Ma. Ordovician rocks are generally distributed in a narrow NE trending belt within the Wuyi-Yunkai orogen, relatively to widely distributed Silurian-Devonian rocks. The Ordovician granitic rocks are mainly distributed in the Wuyi, Yunkai, and Wugongshan areas and exhibit gneissic structures. They were dominantly formed by crustal anatexis and could represent the reworking of Neoproterozoic supracrustal materials. The Silurian-Devonian granitic rocks were massive in structure and are mainly concentrated in the Xuefengshan and Nanling-Wanyangshan areas. They display higher epsilon(Hf)(t) and epsilon(Nd)(t) values and are less variable than the Ordovician granites, suggesting a relatively high contribution of juvenile crust. More importantly, the geochemistry shows a significant transition at ca. 435 Ma, coinciding with regional extension after 435 Ma. We suggest that there was a NE-trending continent-continent collision before 435 Ma and the subsequent increasing orogenic collapse led to the expansion of intracontinental crustal melting.

AB The Precambrian basement shear zones played a major role in developing offshore structures that are zones of weakness along the eastern continental margin of India. A compilation and analysis of various geophysical datasets, particularly magnetic, gravity, seismicity and seismic reflection data support a clear geometric connection between the shear zones and offshore structures. The presence of shear zones within the crystalline basement in the continental domain and oceanic domain is demarcated primarily by prominent magnetic lineation. We identified three major magnetic lineaments in the offshore Cauvery basin, which correspond to the Plaghat Cauvery shear system (PCSS) of Southern Granulite terrain (SGT). The faults interpreted in the seismic sections are correlated to the extension of PCSS and indicate the location of reactivation of the shear zones which give rise to considerable intraplate seismicity. The geophysical crustal model shows deep crustal-scale faults associated with the marine prolongation of PCSS. The shear zone extended structures in the offshore might have formed at the breakup stage at the onset of rifting and might be extending up to the continent-ocean transition zone (COTZ). The PCSS partly seems to accommodate the stress created by the northward push of Indian plate against the Asian plate. It is also possible that the shear zone might have extended to the nearby land mass that marks it as one of the principal component in Gondwana reconstruction.

AB The Kukaazi Pb-Zn deposit was recently discovered in the western Kunlun orogen (WKO), NW China. This deposit consists of three ore blocks (ICI to KIII) hosted in Mesoproterozoic metamorphosed rocks. Ores are mainly composed of sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite and scheelite. Here we present in-situ LA-ICP-MS trace elemental compositions of sphalerite and galena of sulfide ores from ore blocks KI and MI, to shed light on the ore formation and its regional tectono-metallogenic implications. Sphalerite from ore block KI contains higher contents of Fe, Mn, Co, Cu, Bi, Sn, and Sb than sphalerite from ore block KU. Nonetheless, sphalerite from the two ore blocks has compositions similar to the sphalerite from typical skarn deposits. Galena from ore block KI is compositionally different from galena from ore block MI, and has relatively high Ag, Cd and T1 contents and low Sb content. Such differences are probably due to different ore-forming temperatures in these two ore blocks. Based on the Cd partition coefficient between the co-existing sphalerite-galena pairs, sulfide ores in ore block KI may have formed under higher temperatures (265-387 degrees C) than those in ore block MI (229-251 degrees C).
   Combined with previous studies, we propose that the Pb-Zn mineralization at Kukaazi was distal skarn related and formed in a continental arc setting. Discovery of this deposit implies that WKO is a promising area for future porphyry/skam-related Pb-Zn (-Cu-W) mineral exploration in northwestern China.

AB The Qingchengzi Pb-Zn deposit is located in the northeastern Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt (JLJB), North China Craton (NCC). Field observation and age dating indicate that the deposit was formed from Paleoproterozoic sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX) stratiform mineralization overprinted by Late Triassic hydrothermal vein-type mineralization. Five types of fluid inclusions (FIs) are identified in the quartz grains, based on petrography and laser Raman spectroscopy: liquid-rich two-phase (type 1), vapor-rich two-phase (type 2), CO2-bearing (types 3a and 3b), and CO2-pure (type 4). Quartz from the SEDEX stratiform ores contains only type 1 FIs, and hydrogen-oxygen iso-topic compositions indicate that the ore-forming fluids were magmatic water-derived. The ore-forming fluids were likely of medium-temperatures and low-salinity, and belonged to a NaCl-H2O hydrothermal system. Quartz from the vein-types contains all five types of FIs, and the ore-forming fluids may have belonged to a medium-temperature, low-salinity NaCl-H2O-CO2 hydrothermal system. Hydrogen-oxygen isotopes indicate that the vein-type ore-forming fluids were derived from magmatic-meteoric mixed source. Rare-earth element (REE) and sulfur-lead isotopic compositions indicate that ore-forming materials of the SEDEX stratiform mineralization were derived from the wall-rocks and magma, wheres those of the vein-type mineralization were derived from Late Triassic granitic magma, wall-rocks, and the Paleoproterozoic SEDEX ores.
   Based on field geological and geochronological data, we propose the following regional metallogenic model: (1) SEDEX mineralization occurred during the Paleoproterozoic post-collisional extension in the JLJB; (2) vein-type mineralization was generated by the north-dipping subduction of the Yangtze Craton beneath the NCC, which led to continent-continent collision and slab break-off in the Late Triassic.

AB A 3D viscoelastic finite-element model of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, including the Bayan Har block, is established in this article. This model takes into consideration differences in the regional geological structure, the main active fault zone, the active tectonic block (hereafter referred to as a block) and boundary fault zone, the irregular topography and layered lithospheric structure, and the seismic velocity structure of the crust and mantle. Moreover, the present tectonic background stress field in the research area is reconstructed using the constraints of the observed values for the rate of crustal horizontal movement and the direction of maximum principal compressive stress. On these bases, the historical strong earthquake sequences with Ms >= 7 that have occurred around the Bayan Har block since 1900 AD are simulated. Based on the Coulomb failure stress and equivalent stress data, the relationships between stress evolution and strong earthquakes, the interactions between strong earthquakes are investigated. In addition, we have also explored the changes in stress on the Longmenshan fault zone before and after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, as well as the relationships between stress evolution and regional seismicity. The results show that the occurrence of strong earthquakes around the Sayan liar block may be related to the increase in the total stress in the source area. The influence of long-term tectonic stress loading on strong earthquakes cannot be ignored. The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake induced an increase in stress in the southern section of the Longmenshan fault zone, indicating that the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake has an obvious promoting effect on the 2013 Lushan earthquake. The seismicity of the Bayan Har block and its adjacent areas may be affected by the regional total stress state.

   GEOCHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS; CHEMICAL DIFFERENTIATION
AB Tectonic transition from post-collision to intraplate settings is a crucial process in orogenic belts. To characterize such a transition in the Chinese Altai, we conduct an integrated study on Permian to Triassic granitoids. Zircon U-Pb dating reveals that the granitoids can be subdivided into two stages: early Permian (291-286 Ma) and late Triassic (216-209 Ma). Granitoids of both two stages exhibit high SiO2, low Mg#, low Cr and Ni contents, and variable Sr-Nd-Hf isotopes, all of which indicate a multiple crustal origin. Generally, the Triassic granitoids have similar epsilon Nd(t) but relatively higher epsilon Hf(t) values than those of the Permian granitoids. Moreover, the Triassic granitoids possess relatively higher ASI and more variable Al2O3/TiO2, CaO/Na2O, Rb/Sr and Rb/Ba values than those of the Permian granitoids, suggesting that the Triassic magmatic sources were much variable and complicated with higher proportions of sediments. By integrating regional data, two magmatic peaks at Permian and Triassic can also be recognized. From early Permian to Triassic, the SiO2, Na2O + K2O and Th contents, ASI and Sr-87/ Sr-86, Al2O3/TiO2, Rb/Sr and Rb/Ba values for the felsic rocks gradually increase, implying more and more strongly reworking of continental crust. Also, the Rb, Y + Nb and Yb + Ta concentrations for felsic rocks progressively increase from early Permian to Triassic, demonstrating a geodynamic evolution from syn/post-collision to intraplate settings. Furthermore, we propose that the post-collision and intraplate tectonism, especially the latter, could facilitate the generation of high-silica granites, which drive maturation of continental crust in accretionary orogenic belts.

AB The organic-rich lower Silurian Longmaxi Formation is now regarded as the favorable target for shale gas exploration and production. However, the mechanism of organic matter accumulation in these deposits remains highly controversial. In this study, we investigate the total organic carbon (TOC) content and the major and trace element abundances of a newly recovered core from the Yangtze Platform to reconstruct the paleo-environment and to elucidate the factors that control organic matter accumulation. Our results suggest that the greenhouse conditions during the early Silurian were punctuated by several cooling events. Bottom water redox conditions improve gradually upsection with a transition from anoxic water conditions in the lower Longmaxi Formation to suboxic-oxic water conditions in the upper Longmaxi Formation. The primary productivity on the Yangtze Platform appears to have been high during deposition of the Longmaxi Formation, especially in its lower part, due to an enhanced phosphorus recycling. The strong correlations between TOC and copper and nickel imply that the productivity was especially critical to the organic matter accumulation in the lower Longmaxi Formation. Furthermore, the rapid consumption of dissolved oxygen in bottom water favored the establishment of anoxic water conditions, which facilitated organic matter preservation. The poor correlations between TOC and barium and phosphorus in the lower Longmaxi Formation likely reflect intense recycling of nutrients. The evolution of water redox conditions and accumulation of organic matters in the Longmaxi Formation can be related to global fluctuations in sea level and regional tectonic uplift of the Yangtze Platform.

AB Numerous models have been proposed to constrain the process of the South China Sea formation, yet the Paleogene paleoenvironmental researches are hindered by the paucity of long, continuous, well-dated geological records. In this work, Eocene to Oligocene nannofossil biostratigraphy and assemblage changes in a sediment section from the northern South China Sea were studied to shed light on these issues. We established an age model to confine the studied section between similar to 40 and 22 Ma based on 17 calcareous nannofossil datum levels. The age model enabled to date the most prominent seismic reflector T-60 centered at similar to 26.8 Ma, a regional tectonic event interpreted as corresponding to the "Ridge Jump Event" in the early phase of South China Sea spreading. Changes in nannofossil abundance and assemblage compositions imply continuous transgression and deepening of water depth from the Late Eocene to Early Miocene. During the Late Eocene, the studied area was a neritic sea with relatively eutrophic conditions supporting abundant R. lockeri group and C. pelagicus. From similar to 34 Ma to similar to 27 Ma, during the Oligocene, the earlier neritic environment was replaced by relative warm and oligotrophic conditions in a shallow sea, as indicated by higher concentration of C. floridanus, Sphenolithus spp. and Helicosphaera spp. Since similar to 26 Ma, pelagic conditions prevailed, small Reticulofenestra (< 5 mu m) became dominant, and Discoaster spp. also increased in response to the deepened water depth.

TI Petrographic and geochemical characterization of the crustal section of

AB The Molucca Sea Collision Complex (MSCC) preserves the complex interaction between the Eurasian, Philippine Sea and the completely subducted Molucca Sea Plates. Petrological studies of obducted arc and ophiolitic materials in this region thus provide a unique opportunity to elucidate the tectono-magmatic evolution of the area. In this study, we present new petrographic and geochemical data on the crustal section of the Pujada Ophiolite which is extensively exposed in southeastern Mindanao, Philippines. Our work reveals that this ophiolite is a remnant of an oceanic lithosphere with backarc affinity. U-Pb dating of zircons from the isotropic gabbros further constrains the age of the Pujada Ophiolite to Late Cretaceous (90 Ma). This age is consistent with the inferred age of the proto-Molucca Sea Plate based on tectonic reconstructions and tomography. Exposed to the north of the Pujada Ophiolite and separated by a NE-SW trending thrust fault is the Iba Formation. This unit originally purported to be the carapace of the Pujada Ophiolite records an IA (island arc) affinity. The geochemical signature of the Iba Formation suggests derivation from an enriched mantle source affected by slab-derived components related to the East Mindanao-Halmahera Arc. We therefore interpret the Pujada Ophiolite as a trapped fragment of the proto-Molucca Sea Plate that was thrust onto the Halmahera Arc possibly during the waning stages of the collision between the Sangihe and Halmahera Arcs.

AB We conducted major, trace element, Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic, and U-Pb geochronologic analyses of early Cretaceous Kitakami granitic plutons, northeast Japan. We suggest that these plutons include rocks of adakitic affinity, which indicate partial melting of an eclogitic slab. The Kitakami adakites were mostly derived from juvenile oceanic crustal sources, but include inherited zircons with Archean to Neoproterozoic Hf model ages. Rather than being directly derived from crustal rocks of these ages, zircons may have been detrital in the voluminous trench fill sandstone within the Jurassic northern Kitakami accretionary prism. The exhumation of older basement that served as the detrital zircon source may have been triggered by ridge subduction. Although the plutons show a general southward younging from northern Kitakami (120-130 Ma), southern Kitakami (115-125 Ma), and Abukuma (100-115 Ma), restoration of post-crystallization left-slip faults inverts this spatial pattern and results in a northward-younging pattern. This suggests northward migration of a trench-ridge-transform triple junction that included the Izanagi-Farallon ridge. The Sambagawa eclogite may be genetically related to the Kitakami adakite in time and space if the transform duplexing is restored.

AB The clasts of ophiolitic melanges formed in orogenic margins reflect the tectonomagmatic history of a region and record the petrological signatures of oceanic lithospheres that interacted in the past. Exposed at the northwestern edge of Luzon, Philippines, the highly deformed Dos Hermanos Melange (DHM) provides new insights on the complex history of western Luzon island. The DHM is a tectonic melange composed predominantly of ultramafic-mafic clasts set in a sheared serpentinite matrix. The ultramafic clasts are mostly harzburgites with rare occurrences of lherzolite, dunite and chromitite. Petrographic (e.g. protogranular to equigranular texture) and geochemical characteristics (e.g. spinel Cr# = 0.17-0.60, olivine Fo content = 87-91) of the peridotites typify residual mantle peridotites which underwent low to moderately high degrees of partial melting. Mineral chemistry of some dunite and harzburgite samples (e.g. high spinel TiO2 = 0.01-0.64 wt%) further record subsequent modification of the depleted mantle material by arc-related processes (e.g. metasomatism). Most of the mafic clasts classify as gabbros and are composed of highly anorthitic plagioclase (An(88)(-)(99)) and Ti-poor pyroxenes which suggest derivation from arc-related melts. One troctolite clast, however, records the distinct petrographic (e.g. ophitic texture) and geochemical (e.g. low An content of plagioclase = 73-80) signatures of primitive MOR-related magma. These contrasting petrologic signatures in the ultramafic-mafic clasts of the DHM are similar to those observed in the crustal and mantle sections of the Eocene Zambales Ophiolite Complex (ZOC). This suggests that the DHM, like the ZOC, records the complex history of the convergence and emplacement of an ancient oceanic crust onto the Philippine Mobile Belt. Later tectonic processes in the region, which occurred after the emplacement of the ZOC, resulted to the extensive dissection and translation of ophiolitic blocks northwards transforming them into the DHM.

AB Although rotation of fault blocks during seismic and long-term periods has long been recognized in extensional tectonic regimes, the geometry and kinematic behaviors of normal faults at outcrop scale have scarcely been investigated in sufficient detail. In this study, combining with the analysis of high-resolution topography acquired by small unmanned aerial vehicle (sUAV) using the structure-from-motion (SfM) technique, we present the results of our field observations on the structural characteristics of the Seertengshan Piedmont Fault (SPF), a major active normal fault bounding the northern margin of the Hetao Graben, North China. Although previous studies have reported the recent tectonic activity of this fault including timing of most recent earthquake, average slip rate and repeat time of paleo-earthquakes, few of them have focused on geometric patterns of the outcropping fault zones, which provide excellent outcrop-scale examples to investigating geometry and kinematics of active normal faults. Besides the observed prominent fault scarps indicative of recent tectonic activity along the SPF, outcrop observations indicate that in some cases both planar and curved normal faults are developed, forming complex fault zones. Sequential development of normal faults may have rotated the early-formed fault blocks, resulting in shallowly dipping faults and highly tilted strata. Collectively, structural similarities probably exit among normal faults at multiple spatial scales. We suggest that the results of this study are also helpful for a better understanding of structural development and evolution in other actively extending areas.

AB Sediments delivered by global rivers are of utmost importance to the morphological formation and ecosystem evolution of estuary-coast-shelf systems. In this study, numerical modeling, supported by hydrological data, was applied to quantify the impact of climate change and human activities on the water and sediments delivery of five rivers along the east coast of the Liaodong Peninsula to the North Yellow Sea. Simulation results indicate that the water discharge and sediment load of these five rivers during the past millennium reached 27.88 +/- 5.97 km(3) y(-1) and 5.97 +/- 3.26 Mty(-1), respectively. Climate change was the most significant driving factor altering water discharge in the study area, with human activity producing an insignificant effect. Different from runoff, variations in sediment loads are dominated by human activities in past millennium. Our results demonstrate that the soil erosion of five rivers induced by human activities increased sharply by up to 8.1 times over the past few centuries, and that the total dam trapping efficiency for the eastern Liaodong Peninsula was 71.7%. If no dams had been constructed in the study area between 1941 and 2012, the total sediment load of the five rivers would have reached 11.33 +/- 5.70 Mty(-1). This reflects an increase of 92.6% relative to the period between 1000 and 1850 (5.88 +/- 2.93 Mty(-1)) and would have been 3.5 times the actual sediment load during the period 1941-2012 (3.21 +/- 4.61 Mty(-1)).

AB The Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau that is situated in the southwest China is an ideal natural field laboratory for continental dynamics. In this study, through the careful processing and analyzing of the magnetotellurics data, the reliable 2-D electrical model was obtained to examine the relationship between the lithospheric electrical structure and dynamics in the central Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau. Six conductors mainly result from the partial melting and aqueous fluids, and three resistors are related to different tectonic evolution in the model. Combined with other observations, we summarize that the upwelling hot material (partial melting), aqueous fluids, subduction erosion and crushed zone contribute to the error between the electrical location and the geographic location of the Indus-Yarlung Zangbo suture. The subducted Indian plate is shown by the different angles and different locations of its frontier in different areas. The electrical structure beneath the Lhasa terrane corresponds well with the geological features of an old, locally reworked crust dominantly in the central Lhasa terrane with two young juvenile crustal blocks surrounding the central terrane, and it also shows the relationship among the dynamics, magmatism and mineralization in the Gangdise metallogenic belt. Meanwhile, we indicate that the subducted polarity of the Bangong-Nujiang Tethyan Ocean lithosphere was double-sided, and the smooth subduction of the Longmu Tso-Shuanghu Tethyan Ocean lithosphere may cut through the Moho surface approximately 20 km. Above all, these results can provide helpful constrains to understand the evolution mechanism of the Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau.

TI Tectonic uplift of the northern Qinling Mountains (Central China) during

AB The Qinling Mountains, which stretch from east to west in Central China, represent an important geological and geographical boundary between North China and South China. Because of the northeastward growth of the Tibetan Plateau since the late Cenozoic, the northern Qinling Mountains have been strongly reactivated and uplifted. To investigate the landscape response to the tectonic uplift, the geomorphic indices of the northern Qinling Mountains, including the hypsometry, mathematical function of the longitudinal profile, channel longitudinal profile, and steepness index were analyzed. The topographic analysis reveals that the landscape evolution of the Heihe River Basin is in a transient state. The upstream of the Heihe River Basin has undergone a long period of erosion and represents relict landscape. In contrast, the downstream represents adjusting landscape, which formed by river incision in response to the rapid uplift of the northern Qinling Mountains. This is a result of the extension of the Weihe Graben, which has formed due to the northeastward growth of the Tibetan Plateau during the late Cenozoic. The spatial distribution of the geomorphic indices reveals that the NE striking Taibai Fault has experienced strong tectonic activity since the late Cenozoic and is a secondary fault that accelerated the uplift rate of the northern Qinling Mountains. The tectonic stress due to the northeastward growth of the Tibetan Plateau has been transmitted to the northern Qinling Mountains along the Taibai Fault. Therefore, we proposed that the uplift of the northern Qinling Mountains is due to the combined effects of the Weihe Graben extension and Taibai Fault activity, forming the highest peak (Taibai Mountain) of the northern Qinling Mountains near the intersection of the Qinling Piedmont Fault and Taibai Fault.

AB The Bengal Fan, the largest submarine fan in the world, receives a large amount of terrestrial material from the Himalayas and the Indian Peninsula, making it an ideal area for studying land-sea interactions in different time scales. Using the major and trace element compositions of 98 surface sediment samples from the lower Bengal Fan, we identified the provenances of the sediments, calculated the relative contributions of each provenance, and further assessed their controlling factors. The statistic results of the major and trace elements confirm that terrigenous materials comprise the majority on the sediment and that the study area can be divided into three depositional provinces. The main sources of sediments are the Himalayas and Indian river systems, which can be distinguished in the Fe/Al-K/Al scatter diagram. Based on calculation results of a two end-member mixing model, the relative contributions of the Himalayas and the Indian rivers are 55% and 45%, respectively. However, the spatial distributions of sediments from these two sources in the three provinces exhibit a large variation. The Himalayan contributions decrease from 63% in province I (southeast part of the study area) to 53% in province II (central part of the study area) and 45% in province III (northwest part of the study area). Correspondingly, the contributions of Indian rivers increase from province I through province III. During the high sea levels of modern time, seasonal monsoonal currents play a key role in controlling the sediments transport from South Asia continent to the lower fan.

AB An understanding of the depositional environment and paleogeography of the Siwalik foreland basin are crucial in interpreting the basin configuration, sediment transport pathways and its evolutionary history. This study examines the sedimentology of the Siwalik succession of the Kameng River valley, Arunachal Himalaya, northeastern India. The facies characteristics of the fine-grained, well-sorted sediments of the Dafla Formation and its complex, polymodal paleocurrent pattern in this section, reveals deposition in a variety of open marine to deltaic environment. The overlying Subansiri Formation, characterized by coarse-grained, thick, multistoried sandstone, and showing more consistent SW-ward paleocurrent, indicate deposition from a large, axial braided river system. The proposed redefinition of the boundary between the Lower Siwalik Dafia and the Middle Siwalik Subansiri formations implies their transition at around 7.5 Ma, instead of 10.5 Ma, suggested earlier. The revised age of the transition is consistent with the age of arrival of the Transhimalayan sediments at 7 Ma and also denotes the time of marine to fluvial transition in this area. Presence of marine sediments in the Kameng section, with similar records further west, indicates the existence of an extensive seaway in the eastern Himalaya during the lower Siwalik time. The extant paleodrainage reconstructions have been recast on the basis of new data on the sedimentology and paleocurrent from this section. It is inferred that the changing sea level, uplifting Shillong Plateau and drainage evolution in the eastern Himalayan foreland during the middle Miocene time controlled the marine to fluvial transition in the basin.

AB This study constrains the provenance of the trench-fill turbidite sandstones of the Jurassic accretionary complex (Chichibu accretionary complex) in Southwest Japan using detrital zircon U-Pb ages data. Zircons from all sites (six sites) yielded mainly Precambrian and Permian-Jurassic ages. The Precambrian zircons were derived from the North China Block, whereas the Permian-Jurassic zircons were derived from igneous rocks in and around the Korean Peninsula. The percentage of Precambrian zircons ranged from 39.9% to 52.9% (average 45.5%) of the total, and that of the Permian-Jurassic zircons ranged from 46.5% to 57.6 (average 52.6%). Thus, during the Jurassic, an equal number of zircons was continuously supplied from in and around the Korean Peninsula and the North China Block into a trench on the eastern margin of the Asian continent. The percentage of Permian and Triassic zircons gradually decreased over time, whereas the percentage of Jurassic zircons gradually increased. These changes likely reflected the igneous activity in and around the Korean Peninsula during the Jurassic. These results indicate that the turbidite sandstones of the Jurassic accretionary complex in Southwest Japan comprise detritus from not only the North China Block but also the igneous activity in and around the Korean Peninsula. Therefore, the Jurassic accretionary complex in Southwest Japan was likely formed near the North China Block.

AB The arrival times of the converted P-to-S phase at an intra-crustal discontinuity (Pis) or the Moho (Pms) provide a powerful diagnostic tool for detecting anisotropy with horizontal symmetry axis. In this study, we used Pis and Pms arrival times on P receiver functions to determine the anisotropy of the crust from the seismic data recorded by 285 temporary broadband stations and 3 permanent stations deployed in the southeast margin of Tibet. First we measured the splitting parameters of the upper crust by fitting the Pis phase arrival, and then we adjusted the Pms phase arrival to obtain the splitting parameters of the lower crust after correcting for the effect of the anisotropic upper crust on the Pms arrivals. So, we achieved 75 double-layer splitting measurements. In the upper crust the splitting times vary between 0.05 s and 1.34 s with an average of 0.53 s +/- 0.29 s, while in the lower crust they range from 0.06 s to 1.42 s with an average of 0.62 s +/- 0.33 s. The results confirm that the crust is remarkably anisotropic in the southeastern margin of Tibet. In the upper crust, the fast wave polarization directions clearly show a clockwise rotation around the Eastern Himalayan Syntax, suggesting that the extensional fluid-saturated microcracks induced by rigid extrusion from central Tibet are mostly responsible for the observed anisotropy. In contrast, the lattice preferred orientation of anisotropic minerals induced by a channel flow is the main contributor to the lower crust anisotropy.

AB Hydrothermal-related saddle dolomites widely exist in the lower Permian Fengcheng Formation in the northwestern Junggar Basin, and this formation is a set of carbonate-rich deposits in an alkaline saline basin. Core and thin section observations, cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging, and carbon and oxygen isotope composition analyses have been used to study the origins of saddle dolomites with various occurrences. Hydrothermal fluids include Si-rich and Si-poor fluids, and saddle dolomites occur, along with siliceous bands, as debris and assemblages in fragmented rocks and as cements filling pores and microfractures. Different types of dolomites in the Fengcheng Formation have similar delta C-13 values, while the delta O-18 values differed from each other, which demonstrated that the dolomites originated from the same primary carbonates and underwent multiple stages of recrystallization. The delta O-18 values were extremely negative, which was caused by fractionation at high temperatures from hydrothermal fluids. Dolomites are directly or indirectly affected by hydrothermal diagenetic fluids. According to the diagenetic stages, the types of migration paths for hydrothermal fluids, and the patterns of hydrothermal fluids acting on the dolomites, a model was proposed to illustrate the origins and evolution of the dolomites, and three paths were utilized. Path I occurred during the contemporaneous diagenetic stage, when the carbonate particles were still free and could be captured by high-density bottom hydrothermal flows and distorted. Path II occurred during the long diagenetic history after the carbonate-bearing sediments had consolidated. Saddle dolomite assemblages and saddle dolomite debris occurred with the aid of compressive tectonic forces. Path III also occurred in the long diagenetic history, and the host rocks were not fragmented. The saddle dolomites reprecipitated as cements in the pores, stylolites, fractures/microfractures or laminated seams.

AB The Xiadian fault is a crucial seismogenic structure in the North China Plain because of the 1679 A.D. Sanhe-Pinggu M8 earthquake. However, similar to 12 km of the coseismic surface rupture does not match the worldwide statistical relationship between magnitudes and rupture lengths. Paleoseismicity research can assist in resolving this debate. In this study, the synthesized data from geologic investigations, satellite image interpretations, geomorphic mapping, trench logging and sample dating show that the Xiadian fault undergone strong deformation in the Late Quaternary with a characteristic assemblage of landforms, including linear scarps, troughs, sag ponds, small horsts and grabens, and at least eight paleo-earthquake events can be observed. The coseismic displacements are not exactly the same but instead show a range of variation from similar to 1.4 +/- 0.1 m to similar to 0.9 +/- 0.1 m on average, and the median interval between the strong earthquakes was estimated at similar to 2820 +/- 561 years, with an uncertainty value of 0.199. The quasi-periodicity behavior of the Xiadian fault is not as obvious as that of structures in the plate boundary. The surface rupture traces of the M8 earthquake, which is composed of 6 segments in an echelon pattern with a single length, vary from similar to 1 km to similar to 5 km. The asymmetric bell-shaped displacement distribution tends to approach a maximum in the central part in Pangezhuang village while gradually decreasing toward the tips in East Liuhetun and Dongxing villages; this suggests that the surface rupture of this event is may be only similar to 12 km long, although underlying causes require further study.

AB On November 25, 2016, an M-w 6.6 earthquake struck Akto, a county in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China. This earthquake nucleated on the dextral steep-dip strike-slip segment of the Muji fault, in the western Tibetan Plateau. In this study we conducted a joint inversion using a higher number of data than in previous works (i.e., teleseismic P and SH waveform, near-field seismic waveform, and coseismic InSAR displacement data), in order to analyze the spatiotemporal rupture process of this seismic event. The results of the joint inversion showed that the event consisted in a primarily unilateral rupture toward east-southeast (along the Muji fault) and that 90% of the scalar seismic moment was released in the first 18 s. Moreover, we confirmed the occurrence of two major asperities: the first one located right next to the hypocenter, and the second one similar to 30-35 km east of the hypocenter. The first asperity was found at a deeper depth than the second asperity; additionally, it was larger and had a smaller slip. The results of the Coulomb stress change analysis suggested that the rupture of the first asperity triggered the rupture of the second one. The heterogeneity of the on-fault slip revealed the heterogeneity of the inherent strength and stress of the Muji fault; moreover, the clear slip deficit area, characterized by a high Coulomb stress, might indicate a high seismic risk.

AB The Suoerkuduke Cu-Mo skarn deposit is located in Fuyun County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in NW China, within the northern margin of the East Junggar block. Comprehensive studies of ore deposits demonstrate that the deposit features two episodes of skarn mineralization: the first (Episode A) skarn is stratiform or lenticular and is characterized by predominantly disseminated Fe-Cu-Mo ores, whereas the second (Episode B) skarn occurs as veins or stockworks and contains predominantly Cu-Mo-Zn ores.
   Episode A mineralization formed in the Late Devonian (379.2 +/- 2.8 Ma), whereas Episode B mineralization formed in the Early Permian (296.6 +/- 1.9 Ma). Episode A skarn was genetically linked to dacite/syenite porphyries and may have occurred in an island arc setting, whereas Episode B skarn was genetically linked to granite porphyry (295.3 +/- 3.8 Ma) and may have developed in a postcollisional setting.
   Based on mineral paragenesis and crosscutting relationships, the hydrothermal mineralizing event of Episode A is further divided into three stages, i.e., the prograde (Al), oxide (A2), and retrograde (A3) stages, while that of Episode B is divided into four stages, i.e., the prograde (B1), retrograde (B2), quartz-sulfides (B3) and quartzcarbonate (B4) stages. Three types and seven subtypes of fluid inclusions (L-, V- and S1- to S5-types) are distinguished based on fluid compositions and phase assemblages.
   Episode A ore-forming fluid (H2O-NaCl) system involved two major mineralizing events: (1) the first fluid boiling (stage A1) at 530-560 degrees C and lithostatic pressures of 550-800 bar and (2) the second fluid boiling (stage A3) at 370-420 degrees C and hydrostatic pressures of 200-300 bar. Episode B ore-forming fluid (H2O-NaCl-KCl) system involved four major mineralizing events: (1) the first fluid boiling (stage B1) at 530-580 degrees C and lithostatic pressures of 600-850 bar, (2) the second fluid boiling (stage B3) at 320-360 degrees C and hydrostatic pressures of 100-200 bar, (3) overpressure trapping; brine inclusions homogenized by halite dissolution can be explained as a result of entrapment under overpressure condition, and (4) mixing with meteoric water (stage B4). Fluid boiling was the predominant ore-forming mechanism, while mixing between magmatic and meteoric fluids may also have contributed to ore mineral precipitation (mainly for sphalerite) in Episode B to a lesser extent.

This has been achieved on the basis of Makishima-Mackenzie's theory, Rocherulle et al. model and Abd El-Moneim and Alfifi's approaches. It has been found that, both Makishima-Mackenzie's theory and Abd El-Moneim and Alfifi's approaches can be applied successfully to predict the compositional changes in elastic moduli of WO3-B2O3-MgO-TeO2 glasses. In case of Ag2O-V2O5-MoO3-TeO2 glasses, the best correlation between theoretical and experimental elastic moduli can be achieved if the effect of the basic structural units TeO4, TeO3, VO4, VO5, MoO4 and MoO6 is taken into account. In compared to Makishima-Mackenzie's theory, Rocherulle et al. model appears to be more applicable for predicting Poisson's ratio. Moreover, the compositional changes in bulk modulus are predictable from the molar volume.

DE Tellurite glass; Microresonator; Dispersion; Optical frequency comb;

AB We present the first theoretical analysis of optical frequency comb generation in tellurite microresonators with whispering gallery modes. The regime of dissipative soliton generation is simulated numerically in tellurite microbubbles pumped at 1.95 mu m or at 2.3 mu m by a Tm-doped tellurite fiber laser. Using microbubble geometry allows controlling the zero dispersion wavelength and obtaining anomalous dispersion needed for soliton generation at both pump wavelengths, whereas the zero dispersion wavelength of the analyzed TeO2-WO3-La2O3 glass is 2.17 mu m. The glass parameters measured in the previous experiments are used for modeling. It is shown that for the optimized characteristics of microbubbles, optical frequency combs with a spectral width of 200 nm (at the level of - 30 dB) can be obtained with a low pump power threshold of about a few mW. Ultrashort pulses with a duration of about 130 fs and repetition rates of a few hundred GHz correspond to these combs in the time domain.

AB Assessment of activator distribution in lanthanide doped nanocomposites is an important and challenging task. Oxyfluoride glass ceramics have been chosen as a model system to characterize incorporation efficiency of Eu3+ ions in CaF2 nanocrystals using a combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques. Lattice constant changes induced by size mismatch of Eu3+ and Ca2+ ions have been used to evaluate Eu3+ content in CaF2. The distortion of CaF2 lattice due to incorporation of europium ions can be detected from EPR investigations via Gd3+ paramagnetic probe spectra. It is shown that ratio of different symmetry CaF2:Gd3+ centres and linewidth of EPR transitions can be used to monitor europium content in the crystalline phase of glass ceramics.

AB Nanocomposite polymer membranes based on PVA/TiO2 were prepared by a solution casting method. Glutaraldehyde solution (GA) was used as linking agent to improve the chemical, thermal and physical properties of the membranes. The degree of cross-linking was varied by changing the reaction time. The phase behavior of the membranes was examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). High resolution SEM micrographs show that the TiO2 nanoparticles are homogeneously dispersed, whilst the PVA crosslinks with the inorganic phase and fill in the gap between the nanoparticles. The ionic conductivity measurements were studied by impedance spectroscopy in the radio frequency range between 5 kHz to 5 MHz. Proton conductivity increases by several orders of magnitude with increasing cross-linking reaction time, reaching a maximum of 0.016 Scm(-1) at 130 degrees C for the PVA/TiO2 composition of 1:12%, which was cross-linked for 42 h and then immersed in a 32 wt% KOH solution for 24 h. The ionic activation energy of the prepared membranes ranged from 0.038 KeV to 0.121 KeV. This result was carried out to obtain an estimation of the desorption time of water in the range from room temperature to the decomposition temperature around 500 degrees C.

AB xMoO(3)-50ZnO-(50-x)P2O5, i.e. (1-x/50)Zn(PO3)(2)-(x/50)ZnMoO4, glasses were prepared up to x = 25. It has been proved that the glasses are not a mixture of boundary components, but that chemical reactions taking place in the melt during synthesis produce in equilibrium a more complicated chemical mixture. Molybdenum is incorporated into the glass structure as a molybdate(2-) and also as complex cations, a colorless molybdenyl MoO4+ (d(0) system) and blue colored MoO3+ (d(1)). The chemical model of the studied glasses was designed indicating that the glassy matrix gradually changes with increasing molybdenum content from pure anionic metaphosphate to the cationic-anionic network with the help of molybdenyl cation strongly bonded by four covalent donor-acceptor bonds with non-bonding phosphate oxygens. The compositional dependencies of some physical properties agree with the proposed chemical model. The melts or glasses of chemical compositions near the glass-forming border are less stable and immiscibility of glass phases was found.

AB Transition metal oxide WO3 is attractive in photonics and magneto-optical applications due to its dual functions in glass network and electron transitions between different valences. In this paper, for the first time, we report the photoluminescence, magnetic and magneto-optical properties of WO3 in Faraday rotation glasses taking advantage of its low band gap, high refractive index and empty d shell characters. Spectra analysis revealed that WO(3 )co-existed as W6+ and W5+ in WO4 and WO6 groups, and their conversion is WO3 concentration-dependent. Faraday rotating glasses showed stronger network connectivity after doping WO3 due to its high field strength and network former role of WO4 unit. Emission at 365 nm due to the band-to-band electron transition of W5+ was found in all WO3 doped glasses, while emission at 468 nm due to oxygen defects presented only in ceramic.

AB Homogeneous 89.9SiO(2)-4Al(2)O(3)-6P(2)O(5)-0.1Yb(2)O(3)/Eu2O3 glasses were fabricated via a sol -gel method and sintered under vacuum at high temperature, and subsequently they were annealed at 850 degrees C for 15 and 75 h. Effect of thermal annealing time on structures and properties of glasses was systematically investigated. Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) and Raman scattering spectra were employed to characterize the network structures. Pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques and the emission and excitation spectra of Eu3+ ions were used to study the local environment of Yb3+ ions. SSNMR and Raman results indicate that AlPO4 units increase at the expense of Al-V, Al-VI and P-(3) groups after annealing. The glass network structures have a significant influence on density and refractive index. EPR and Eu3+ spectra indicate an increase in Al around Yb3+ ions and a reduction in the asymmetry degree of Yb3+ ligands. A correlation between structures and properties of glasses is developed.

AB The effects of addition of trivalent metal oxides: Gd2O3, Dy2O3, Eu2O3, Er2O3, Y2O3, and B(2)O(3 )on the size and distribution of anti-glass phases of BiNbTe2O8 in the system: xR(2)O(3)-(10-x)Bi2O3-10Nb(2)O(5)-80TeO(2) (x = 1 and 2 mol%) are studied. The samples prepared by melt-quenching are predominantly glassy phase but contain co-existing inclusions (droplets) of anti-glass BiNbTe2O8. The incorporation of Gd2O3, Dy2O3, Eu2O3, Er2O3, Y2O3 in the glass system enhances the glass transition temperature and promotes the growth of the anti-glass droplets. On the other hand the addition of B2O3 decreases the glass transition temperature and inhibits the growth of the inclusions and produces purely amorphous samples. The photoluminescence spectra show intense red emission in Eu3+-doped samples while yellow light is emitted from Dy3+ doped samples. The micro-Raman spectra of the glass and anti-glass inclusions are very similar which indicates same chemical composition and short-range structure of the glass and anti-glass phases.

AB Amorphous aluminophosphate (AmAlPO4) materials were synthesized by conventional precipitation technique from different phosphate precursors (Na4P2O7, NaH2PO4, Na2HPO4, (NH4)H2PO4, (NH4)(2)HPO4 and H3PO4) without using any structure directing agents. All the prepared materials were analyzed by Al-27 and P-31 MAS-NMR, PXRD, FT-IR, XPS, BET, NH3- TPD and SEM-EDS. The catalytic activity of the materials was checked for synthesis of diphenyl urea (DPU). Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) as a precursor was found to be more active catalyst (which yielded 90% of DPU) than the salt forms. Al-27 and P-31 MAS-NMR studies showed the presence of variable percentages of tetra and penta coordinated Al species, which are attributed to the catalytic activity of AlPO4 center dot AmAlPO4 materials prepared were amorphous having intrinsic mesoporosity, moderate surface area and moderately strong acidic sites. A synergetic combination of all these surface properties play a subtle role in determining the activity of the differently coordinated Al species in the catalysts.

AB The temperature-dependent liquid structures of Co-B melts were studied by in-situ measuring the magnetization. A magnetization anomaly in term of the non-Curie-Weiss temperature dependence of magnetization was observed in the overheated state, demonstrating a temperature-induced liquid-liquid structure transition. This anomalous behavior was found to be a universal formula for the Co-B binary alloy system. The transition point (T-0) and two paramagnetic Curie temperatures (theta(p)(L-1), theta(p)(L-II)) corresponding to two distinct kinds of liquids (i.e., high-magnetization liquid (HML) I and low-magnetization liquid (LML) II) were measured. With the increased concentration of Co, T-0, theta(p)(L-I) and theta(p)(L-II) shift to higher temperatures and the Curie constants for the HML and LML decrease. Based on the location of T-0, a guideline is drawn above the liquidus in the Co-B phase diagram, which could provide a significant guidance to the practical melt treatment.

AB Inelastic x-ray scattering spectra of fluid S were measured from 403 K near the melting point to 1343 K in the supercritical region at 25 MPa. Although the dynamic structure factor in the supercritical region exhibits a single peak profile, the spectrum includes collective inelastic excitations besides the quasielastic component. The acoustic excitation energy in the supercritical region is close to the one predicted by the sound speed in the fluid consisting of S-8 molecules and the observed excitation energies of the stretching modes in S molecules suggest that few fraction of S-2 molecules in the supercritical region near the liquid-vapor critical point. This result indicates that the nearest neighbor coordination number in the supercritical fluid S obtained by x-ray diffraction [Inui et al., J. Phys. Conf. Ser. 98 (2008) 012008] was underestimated.

AB In this work, we have five samples of NiO Nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in tellurite glass system of composition Neodymium doped tellurite nanostructured glass having a composition of (72.5-x)TeO2-15MgO-10Na(2)O-2.5Nd(2)O(3)-(x)NiO, x = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 mol% has successfully been completed by melt-quenching procedure. Structure of crystallization is determined using XRD technique verifies amorphous natures of produced glass. Differential thermal stability analyser (DTA-Parkin-Elmer) is utilized to illustrate the thermal stability of a sample at a temperature ranged from 300 to 600 degrees C. A Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) is used to detect the presence of NiO NPs and High-Resolution Transmission Microscope (HRTEM) is utilizing to measure the d-spacing of the NPs. The structure in glass network is identified by FT-IR and Raman spectrometer. The elemental trace in the glass sample is detected using the energy dispersive of X-ray (EDX) analysis. Meanwhile, magnetization measurements are carried out using Variable sample magnetometer (VSM). The transition temperature, T-g is found at 388 degrees C, the melting temperature T-m is ranged at 530-540 degrees C depending on composition while the thermal stability is around 117 degrees C. The structural and magnetic properties of the glass samples are observed to be delicate to NiO NPs concentration variations. The d-spacing at (111) plane having a size of 0.24 nm proves the presence of NiO NPs. The glass network contains of bending vibrations of Te-O-Te linkages centred at 448 cm(-l) which is also the stretching band of NiO mode. It is also found that the glass structure is dominated with the existence of TeO3, TeO3+1 and TeO4 tribypiramidal. The glass system reveals paramagnetic behaviour by magnetic hysteresis at room temperature with He values were observed to be decreased from 610 +/- 30.5 to 139 +/- 6.95 (Oe) and ratio of (Mr/Ms) from 0.153 +/- 0.008 to 0.071 +/- 0.004with the increase of NiO NPs concentration.

Density increased and the molar volume decreased with increasing the silicon content, which reveals that the glass samples became more compact as the SiO2 increased. XRD showed that all glass samples were amorphous, The FTIR data indicated the existence of TeO3, BiO6, BO4, BO3, and SiO4 (with one non-bridging oxygen (Q3)) structural groups. UV-VIS-IR spectra revealed the presence of five bands from H-6(15/)2 to the F-6(5/2), H-6(5/2), F-6(9/2), H-6(9/2) and H-6(11/2) according to the energy levels 12500, 11210, 9225, 7911, and 5952 cm(-1) respectively. The emission spectra showed two emission bands at around 480 nm and 575 nm corresponding to the F-4(9/2), H-6(15/2) and F-4(9/2)/H-6(13/2) transitions, while the band at 664 nm corresponds to transition F-4(9/2)/H-6(1)1/(2).

AB Atomic-scale insights into borosilicate glass dissolution are critical to the development of waste form corrosion models. While Monte Carlo (MC) simulations have been instrumental in advancing the state of knowledge, all simulations to date have relied on lattices to represent the glass structure, potentially introducing artifacts. A new approach (amorphous MC approach) was developed whereby glass structures generated from molecular dynamics simulations were used as starting points for MC simulations. Correlations between dissolution rate and structural features were revealed in MC simulations of sodium borosilicate glasses that covered a wide compositional range. Notably, the lattice MC approach predicted the fraction of tetrahedral boron to have a lesser influence on the dissolution rate than computed with the amorphous MC approach. The lattice MC simulations also overestimated the dissolution rate for a given glass composition. These findings highlight the importance of using truly amorphous structures in MC simulations of glass corrosion.

AB Recent advances in computational glass physics enable the study of computer glasses featuring a very wide range of mechanical and kinetic stabilities. The current literature, however, lacks a comprehensive data set against which different computer glass models can be quantitatively compared on the same footing. Here we present a broad study of the mechanical properties of several popular computer glass forming models. We examine how various dimensionless numbers that characterize the glasses' elasticity and elasto-plasticity vary under different conditions - in each model and across models - with the aim of disentangling the model-parameter-, external-parameter- and preparation-protocol-dependencies of these observables. We expect our data set to be used as an interpretive tool in future computational studies of elasticity and elasto-plasticity of glassy solids.

AB In this study, different peak loads and varying cooling rates on creep behavior of (Zr0.6336Cu0.1425Ni0.1012Al0.12)(97.4)Er-2.6 bulk metallic glass were studied by nanoindentation tester and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results show that the change of different load and cooling rate has a great influence on the creep behavior of the alloy. Under high peak load conditions, the increasing of the creep displacement and the stress exponent (n) show strong indentation size effect. The hardness of the specimen without rare earth element is 5 times larger than the specimen with rare earth element. With the increase of the cooling rate, the creep displacement of the specimen is increasing and the time to enter the steady state creep is prolonging. The hardness and elastic modulus of the material are sensitive to the cooling rate relative to the load change.

AB The effect of rare earth elements (Y, La, Nd, Sm, and Gd) on the structures, thermal expansion, chemical stability and crystallization behavior of phosphate-based glasses were characterized by using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), Diffuse reflectance UV-Visible spectra, thermal expansion coefficient, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). UV-Vis spectra not only exhibit the absorption peaks of rare earth cations but also reveal the reduction of band gap (E-g) with increasing the cationic field strength (CFS) of rare earth elements, further establishing the change of non-bridging oxygen (NBOs) density in the glass structures. It is found that there is a decrease in thermal expansion coefficient (alpha) with increasing the CFS of rare earth, and the study shows a strong correlation between a values and NBOs in the rare earth phosphate glass systems. The chemical durability tests of glass blocks demonstrate that the normalized leach rates (NRRE) increase with decreasing the radius of rare earth elements, and La-doped phosphate glass with high thermal expansion coefficient has good chemical durability. By a two-stage thermal treatment, a preliminary study of the crystallization mechanism for the rare earth phosphate glasses is carried out, and the major crystalline phases are identified.

Special attention was focused on the microstructure, crystallization process and initial permeability. The crystallization process and microstructure were examined by using differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffractometry, respectively. The temperature dependence of initial permeability was presented in combination with the effect of the Ge substitutions. As a result, the Curie temperature of amorphous (Fe0.8Co0.2)(72.7)Al0.8Si17.5Nb3Cu1B5 alloy was enhanced by Ge addition, which implied improved soft magnetic properties at elevated temperatures. The (Fe0.8Co0.2)(71.7)Al0.8Si17.5Nb3Cu1B5Ge1 alloy annealed at 640 degrees C for 0.5 h exhibited superior magnetic softness at room- and high-temperatures with respect to the Ge-free alloy.

AB An Er3+-doped TeO2 - Ta2O5 - ZnO (TTZ) tellurite glass has been investigated to explore its possible application in mid-infrared laser glass and fiber lasers. Glass-forming region of the ternary TTZ glass system was determined based on the thermodynamic calculation and experiments. Physical and optical properties of the TTZ glass were characterized in detail by using Raman, different scanning calorimetry, luminescence spectra, and fluorescence decay curves. An intense 2.7 mu m emission was observed in Er3+-doped TTZ glasses upon the excitation of 980 nm laser diode (LD). The excellent thermal stability (Delta T-max = 203 degrees C), low maximum phonon energy (similar to 770 cm(-1)), high emission cross-section (0.82 x 10(-20 )cm(2)) and spectroscopic figure of merit (3.22 x 10(-24) cm(2)s) indicate that the Er3+-doped TTZ glass could be a promising candidate for efficient similar to 3 mu m fiber lasers and amplifiers.

AB Sodium borosilicate(Na2O-B2O3-SiO2, NBS) glass doped with Ni nanoparticles has been successfully prepared by a sol-gel technique combined with atmosphere control method. Thermal gravimetric (TG) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) are used to study the feasibility formation mechanism from the xerogel to densified NBS glass network. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as well as X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) analysis reveal that the cubic structure of metal Ni with uniform spherical shape has formed in the NBS glass matrix. The average size is determined to be 11.85 nm. In particular, a mechanism for the formation of Ni/NBS glass is proposed based on the microstructure, BET analysis and N-2 adsorption aperture curve. At last, nonlinear optical properties of Ni/NBS glass are investigated by using the Z-scan technique with a Ti:Sapphire laser at 800 nm. Results illustrate that the third-order optical nonlinear susceptibility chi((3)) of the glass reaches to 5.51 x 10(-12) esu.

AB Aluminate glasses have excellent optical and mechanical properties, in addition to high thermal and chemical stability. However, aluminate glasses require high melting temperatures and exhibit poor glass forming ability, causing difficulties while preparation by the melt-quench method. Therefore, it is necessary to establish novel methods to improve melting conditions and glass forming tendencies for aluminate glasses. 40La(2)O(3)-10Nb(2)O(5)-(50-x)Al2O3-xBaO (x = 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10) glasses were prepared by the aerodynamic levitation method. XRD, DTA, and Raman and NMR spectroscopic techniques were used to investigate the effects of BaO on the structure and thermal properties-including crystallization behavior-of lanthanum aluminate glass. The results show that the addition of BaO increases the glass transition temperature (T-g) and stability Delta T of the baseline glass, as Al-Ba-7.5 (40Al(2)O(3)-10Nb(2)O(5)-42.5Al(2)O(3)-7.5BaO) glass has the highest AT value (151 degrees C). The 27 Al MAS NMR spectrum of a high BaO-content glass (Al-Ba-10) shows that about 80% of Al-[IV] and 15% of Al-[V] are present in the glass network. Raman scattering spectra indicate that a peak shown around 790 cm(-1) canbe assigned to the internal stretching vibrations of the Al-non-bridging oxygen (NBO) bonds in depolymerized [AlO4/2] tetrahedrons. The crystallization activation energies were calculated to be 1157.1 kJ/mol and 891.7 kJ/mol (Kissinger method) for Al-Ba-x (x = 0, 7.5) glasses, respectively, which progresses as a diffusion-controlled three-dimensional growth process. The nucleation rate of Al-Ba-O decreases continuously, while Al-Ba-7.5 increases.

AB Chemical strengthening of glass by ion exchange below its glass transition temperature has become a well-established technological process in the glass industry since its introduction in the 1960s. However, some questions related to the basic science of the ion exchange process still remain. In this paper we focus on the observation of a maximum in compression that is often observed below the surface, rather than at the surface as predicted by the Cooper theory. In some glasses, this anomaly appears in a dramatic form, where the surface compression reduces to zero and can even become tensile upon continued ion exchange. We provide an explanation of this anomaly based on a mechanism of volume shrinkage (densification) triggered by the large hydrostatic pressure inherent to ion exchange in some glasses. We propose a mechanical spring-and-dashpot model for the pseudo-viscoelastic behavior of glass to identify the mechanisms and associated time scales that can reproduce the experimental observations. Next, we modify Sane and Cooper's analysis by introducing a new "V-factor" to account for the identified relaxation effects (fast beta-relaxation, slow a-relaxation, and stress release due to volume and shear viscosities). The approach accurately reproduces the subsurface compression maximum anomaly. Our model therefore enables a clearer perspective on the evolution of the glass network during the chemical strengthening process.

AB Bioactive glasses that contain gold nanoparticles are materials with real potential in soft tissue engineering applications due to their ability to stimulate keratinocytes cells' proliferation. In this study, Pluronic F127 stabilized, differently shaped gold nanoparticles, i.e. nanospheres, nanotriangles and spherical nanocages, that were further added through the sol-gel synthesis of the SiO2-CaO-P2O5 glasses. The in vitro bioactivity and bio-compatibility assessments of the obtained composites were then performed. To activate the antibacterial properties, the gold nanocages were stabilized with silver. Although the size distribution and the morphology of gold nanoparticles in the glass undergo changes after thermal treatment, the achieved results demonstrated that the glasses' in vitro bioactivity was not particularly affected. The glass sample with gold nanocages, due to silver content, exhibited great antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The proliferation rates of Human keratinocytes cells were good on glass-AuNPs composites with sphere and nanocage morphology, although all samples showed good in vitro tolerance.

AB In this paper, the effect of the heat treatment process on the surface morphology, crystallization process and magnetic properties of Fe38Co38Mo8Bi15Cu ribbons produced by melt spinning was investigated. Number of protrusions uniformly distributed on surfaces of as-quenched ribbons were identified by atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM results also indicated that variation of surface morphology of density, size, and shape of protrusions along the ribbon surface. According to magnetic force microscopy (MFM) analysis, the magnetic domain walls were not observed for annealing temperatures of 300 degrees C-360 degrees C. After annealing at 420 degrees C, the domains grow wider and align parallel to each other. Minor amounts of bcc-FeCo nano-sized crystalline grains which homogeneously and randomly distributed to the residual amorphous matrix were observed by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The crystalline grains are enlarged and became more visible. The best coercivity and saturation magnetization values were obtained at 360-420 degrees C.

AB In this work, (90-x-y)TeO2-10GeO(2)-(x)Tm2O3-(y)Er2O3 composition of germano-tellurite glasses were synthesized by traditional melting and quenching technique and the spectroscopic properties of synthesized glasses were investigated. The values of Judd-Ofelt (JO) intensity parameters (Omega(t)(t = 2, 4,6)), spontaneous transition probabilities (A), branching ratios (beta) and radiative lifetimes (tau(R)) were obtained by using the Judd-Ofelt (JO) theory and absorption spectra. The stimulated emission cross-sections of TG:Tm and TG:Er glasses in 1.47 mu m and 1.53 mu m wavelength regions were calculated by Fiichtbauer-Ladenburg formula and McCumber theory, respectively. The gain bandwidth-cross section product of TGTm0.5 and TGEr1 glasses was found to be 445.76 x 10(-28) cm(3) and 849 x 10(-28) cm(3), respectively. The fluorescence lifetime measurements were done for the F-3(4) and I-4(13/2) levels to compare with the radiative lifetimes. These results suggest that the TG:Tm and TG:Er studied glasses can potentially possess wider gain bandwidth for S-band amplifier and broadband optical amplifier WDM at 1.53 mu m, respectively.

AB Carbon aerogels and carbon xerogels were synthesized through resorcinol - formaldehyde polycondensation using Na2CO3 as catalyst. The effect of soluble starch introduction in the organic gel preparation on the porous surface properties of these materials was studied. The role of the drying process of the organic gels on the changes in the surface and structural properties of these materials after the addition of soluble starch is discussed. The presence of starch in the prepared carbon xerogels results in the development of microporosity while maintaining the characteristic mesoporosity of carbon xerogels. The Brunauer - Emmett -Teller (BET) surface area increases from 309 m(2)/g in carbon xerogel without soluble starch until 685 m(2)/g when 10% of soluble starch is added. The R- value and average crystallite lattice parameters, inter-layer spacing, crystallite height, crystallite diameter and the average number of aromatic layers per carbon crystallite are discussed in function of drying step and presence of soluble starch. The surface properties were also studied by Raman and DRIFT spectroscopies.

The compositions and amorphous nature of the glasses were confirmed by XRD, Raman and infrared spectroscopies. The SEM shows that the elaborated fibers at a spinning speed of 500 m/min have a diameter of 17 mu m. The degradation study in aqueous solution at 37 degrees C showed a decrease of 99% in degradation rate with the addition of ZnO, CoO and Fe2O3 elements. This confirmed that the chemical durability of the glasses had increased. DSC showed an increase in T-g values by addition ZnO, CoO and Fe2O3 contents. The tensile properties show that the phosphate glass fibers have good mechanical properties, the highest tensile strength obtained is 1321 +/- 50 MPa. The density measured revealed an increase from 2.54 to 2.7 g.cm(-3).

AB Structural, physical and gamma ray shielding properties of Dy3+ doped telluroborate glasses have been discussed. The molar volume of the glasses is proportional to the TeO2 content. The FTIR studies investigate the expansion of TeO(2 )content and the dynamic change of tetrahedral [BO4] units into trigonal [BO3] units. Using the absorption spectra, optical band gap (E-g) and Urbach's energy (Delta E) values are calculated. The molar volume of oxygen (V-O) and boron-boron separation (< d(B-B) >) values are increasing while there is a fall in oxygen packing density (OPD) from 0% to 40% of TeO2. The ionic nature of the present glasses is analyzed from the bonding parameter (delta), optical basicity (Lambda(th)), covalent and ionic characteristic factors. The gamma photon attenuation investigated employing GEANT4 code. The transmission factor (TF) shows that OTBD sample (0 wt% of TeO2) has the highest TF, while the 4TBD sample (40 wt% of TeO2) has the lowest TF.

AB Porous hollow silica spheres were synthesized using silk fibroin spheres as novel single sacrificial template via a sol-gel route and their in vitro biocompatibility and drug delivery property were evaluated. TEM observation showed that silica spheres had a hollow cavity and a porous shell, while BET measurement showed that they had the pore size of 22 nm and specific surface area of 45 m(2)/g. FT-IR spectrum showed that silica spheres contained Si-O-Si bonds. After exposure to Hela cells, MTT assay indicated that silica spheres were in vitro biocompatible. It was found that silica spheres not only supported adsorption of tetracycline hydrochloride (TH, one of the representative antibiotics) with adsorption efficiency of 17.4%, but also exhibited a sustained release behavior for TH. The TH-loaded silica spheres showed antibacterial property to inhibit the growth of two representative bacteria: Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, indicating that the released TH was biologically active.

AB Glassy carbon (GC) is a class of disordered carbon materials that is known to be superelastic and non-graphitizing up to 3000 degrees C. The maximum heat treatment temperature is often used as a proxy to denote structure and physical properties. GC synthesised at low temperatures (similar to 1000 degrees C) is often classified as Type I GC which has advantages of higher elastic modulus, resistance to oxidation, and lower permeability to gases. Type II GC is synthesised at higher temperatures ( > 2000 degrees C), has fewer impurities, is more electrically conductive, and is rated to a higher service temperature. Here Type I and II GC samples sourced from two suppliers are investigated using Rutherford backscattering spectrometry and elastic recoil detection analysis for composition, Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscope imaging, X-ray and neutron diffraction for structure determination, nanoindentation for mechanical properties, and Van der Pauw measurements for resistivity. The results show that the broad classifications of Type I or Type II do not correlate with the physical properties of the samples. We conclude that the quoted maximum heat treatment temperature alone is not sufficient to specify the properties of GC and that a careful microstructural examination of the material should be used to inform materials selection.

AB Described herein is a new approach to produce glass materials using a CO2 laser as unique heating source. In this study, the well-known PbO center dot SiO2 (PS) system was chosen as a glass model because of its very good glass forming ability and stoichiometric crystallization. The laser-produced glasses presented the same temperature stability as the conventionally produced glass, as observed by DSC results, without the presence of crystalline phases according to XRD and Raman results. Additionally, no structural change was detected among the glasses, when probed by Raman and XANES. After thermal treatment at 730 degrees C for 1 h, the laser-produced glass crystalizes to the alamosite (PbSiO3) phase which confirms the nominal stoichiometry without Pb volatilization. In optimal conditions, the total PS laser-produced glass was synthesized within 3 min., which is remarkably fast in comparison to conventional processes using an electric furnace that can last several hours.

AB In the recent article entitled "How to reveal the correct elemental concentration profiles in poled multicomponent silicate glasses from the data of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS)," a SIMS data treatment is proposed, and is predicated on the assumption of the "true" depth profile for poled glasses having a fixed concentration of network-formers like silicon, under the auspices of such species being "immovable" during poling. Deliberated herein are the assumptions underlying this treatment, and particularly highlighting experimental evidence that should lead one to expect that the volumetric concentration of network-formers like silicon should, in fact, be altered during poling (through effects such as network repolymerization). These points cast serious concerns on the fundamental premise underlying the data treatment.

AB High wear between surfaces may lead to an increase of cost of production in mechanical engineering industry. To solve this problem, Fe-based amorphous coatings prepared using appropriate technology can provide an effective and economical surface protection. In this work, Fe-based metallic glass powders were deposited by cold gas dynamic spraying (CGDS) and high velocity air fuel (HVAF) technology onto 35CrMo steel alloy. Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy and microhardness measurement were employed to identify the morphology, microstructure, thickness, porosity, elements distribution and hardness of the assprayed coatings, while X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetry and different thermal analysis were applied to clarify the amorphous nature. The dry sliding wear tests were conducted using a ball-on-plate linear tribometer with the counter-face of ZrO2. The worn surface and worn-off debris collected after friction were studied to investigate the wear mechanism. The results display a denser and more uncrystallized structure of CGDS coating than HVAF coating. Moreover, CGDS coating has lower coefficient of friction (COF) and wear rate at different applied loads, indicative of improved wear-resistance.

AB In this work, a series of germanium-sulfur (Ge-S) chalcogenide glasses (ChGs) was prepared. The third-order optical nonlinear (TONL) properties of ChGs were measured using Z-scan technique at 800 nm. A rapid decrease of optical bandgap energy (E-opg) and rapid increase of nonlinear refractive index (n(2)) were observed at a mean coordination number (MCN) of 2.67, which is known as the second topological threshold. Raman spectra showed that the appearance of [Ge(Ge2S2)] tetrahedra in the glass network is responsible for the decrease of E-opg at the threshold MCN and the significant enhancement to the TONL properties of the Ge-S ChGs.

AB In the present work, we reported the anomalous dependence of magnetic and magnetocaloric properties on the composition of Gd-Ni binary amorphous alloys. The Gd-Ni binary amorphous ribbons are obtained within a compositional range Gd63Ni37 to Gd71Ni29. By measuring the thermal properties and magnetization curves of the amorphous alloys, glass forming ability (GFA) and magnetic entropy change (-Delta S-m) curves were determined. It was found that in contrast to most of the other alloy systems, both the Curie temperature (T-c) and the maximum -Delta S-m (-Delta S-m(peak)) do not change obviously with the alloy composition of the Gd-Ni amorphous alloys. The mechanism for the compositional dependence of T-c as well as -Delta S-m(peak) of the Gd-Ni amorphous alloys was investigated.

AB Decreasing the pH value of a concentrated sodium silicate solution while maintaining its basic environment, largely affects solution stability. The charge modification induces by the presence of acidic species is expected to destabilize initial equilibrium, thus affecting original structure. Acidification along with dilution of a concentrated sodium silicate solution ([Si] = 7 mol/L, Si/Na = 1.71, pH = 11.56) was realized by slightly adding a 0.5-2 mol/L hydrochloric acid solution under stirring. Through small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, specific surface area and elementary chemical analysis, chemical species involved in the gelation and maturation of a concentrated sodium silicate solution were characterized. Results show that the initial mother solution which is a high pH-sensitive solution, is composed of both neutral and charged species such as Si7O18H4Na4, Si7O18H5Na3, (Si7O18H3Na4)(-) and (Si7O18H4Na3)(-). These complex species are likely to dissociate, aggregate and/or condense as a function of both pH and silicon concentration. Accordingly, it is possible to master these solutions for appropriate usage.

AB Two oxynitride glass series with the composition of 35Na(2)O-5BeO-(60-x)SiO2-xSi(3)N(4) and 9Li(2)O-27Na(2)O-5BeO-(59-x)SiO2-xSi(3)N(4), were prepared. The glasses' topography and structure were studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The composition was analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer, SEM-EDS and nitrogen and oxygen elemental analyzer. Na-(Li)-Be-silicate glasses were found to contain up to approximately 3.4 (or 5.2 for EDS measurements) at.% of N, respectively. The samples were homogenous in their topography and compositions of their cross-sections.
   The presence of three-fold coordinated nitrogen atoms in Na-Be-Si-O-N glasses results in higher degree of polymerization as was observed by Raman spectroscopy. The spectrum of analogous glasses with lithium did not show a significant decrease in Q(2) units but exhibit the presence of Q(4) units which also indicates a polymerization of the network. The incorporation of nitrogen in these glasses leads to the increase of the glass transition temperature and thermal stability.

AB Fluoro-sulfo-phosphate poly-anionic glasses KPO3-AlF3-K2SO4 (KPFS) and Nd3+-doped samples (Nd-KPFS) were prepared by conventional melt-quenching method and their physical properties were comprehensively analyzed. Their actual glass compositions were carefully checked by different methods. These glasses exhibit typically low linear refractive index n(d) (similar to 1.482) and nonlinear refractive index n(2) (similar to 0.86 x 10(-13) esu), high Abbe's number (similar to 72.0) and moderate elasticity modulus E* (similar to 50.2 GPa). The spectroscopic properties of Nd-KPFS specimens are further evaluated by the Judd-Ofelt theory, and the results suggest that the stimulated radiative parameters can be enhanced by tuning sulfate contents. Besides, Nd-KPFS glasses present relatively long lifetime tau(exp) (similar to 428 mu s) and large figure of merit FOM (similar to 9.29 x 10(-24) cm(2) s). All of the results imply that such fluoro-sulfo-phosphate glass would be a promising candidate for solid-state laser.

AB Herein, the effects of cooling rate during rapid solidification of Mg40Al60 metallic glasses are studied using the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The system energy, pair distribution function (PDF), local structures, configuration entropy, and three-dimensional visualization are used to systematically analyze the evolution of microstructure with temperature. Results indicate that the lower the cooling rate, the lower the average atomic energy. With the decrease of cooling rate, increases the height difference between two splitting subpeaks of the second peak on PDF curves; while decreases the onset temperature of glass transition. The effect of the cooling rate on the topologically close-packed (TCP) clusters is similar to the local five-fold structures of S555: the lower the cooling rate, the more the amount of TCP clusters, and the lower the configuration entropy. In addition, most TCP clusters are centered the smaller Al atoms.

From the quasi-linear concentration variations for covalency factor N, tetragonal compression ratio rho and core polarization constant kappa with only three adjustable coefficients, the concentration dependences of EPR parameters are suitably interpreted. N increases linearly for NLB (0.839-0.864) and NNB (0.801-0.811) with x (0-8 mol%) but shows the quadratic decrease for NKB (0.802, 0.807, 0.801 at 0, 4 and 8 mol%), whereas rho and kappa decrease linearly. For different alkali metal A at the same x, N decreases with increasing ionicity of A, while rho and kappa increase due to declining force constant of V4+-O2- bond and enhancing vanadium 3d-3 s (4 s) orbital admixtures, respectively.

AB Metal-doped nickel ferrite ((Ni,Mg,Cu)Fe2O4) was synthesized through a coprecipitation method by using nickel sulfide concentrate as a raw material. The as-prepared (Ni,Mg,Cu)Fe2O4 exhibited excellent catalytic activity in the system of visible-light/(Ni,Mg,Cu)Fe2O4/oxalic acid for degrading Rhodamine B, confirming it could be used as an efficient heterogeneous photo-Fenton-like catalyst. The octahedral occupation of Fe3+ ions on the surface of spinel ferrite mainly determined the activity of (Ni,Mg,Cu) Fe2O4. Under the optimum conditions, the as-prepared catalyst demonstrated high degradation and total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiencies up to 97.2% and 85.6% in 90 min, respectively. The excellent activity and reusability make the catalyst from nickel sulfide concentrate possess competitiveness in industrial application. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID QUANTUM DOTS; GALLIUM; GROWTH
AB We report a method to fabricate surfactant-free eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn) sessile nanodroplets out of liquid metal. The method takes advantage of weak adherence between the liquid metal and its ultrathin surface oxide layer. During the van der Waals exfoliation process of transferring the ultrathin oxide layer to a desired substrate, nanoscale liquid metal droplets could form due to dynamic wetting failure. Here we have prepared EGaIn nanodroplets on the surface of transferred Ga2O3 ultrathin films. Surface morphology measured by atomic force microscope shows the vast majority of nanodroplets are isolated and randomly distributed, with mean radius below 100 nm. This preparation method is facile, low cost and can be applied in fields such as Ga-catalyzed nanostructures growth and gallium plasmonics. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we used a sessile drop experiment to assess a feasibility of novel processing design engaging liquid-phase assisted fabrication of multi-phase materials from Mo-Si-B system. For this purpose, binary eutectic silicon-boron alloy (Si-3.2B wt%) was subjected to contact heating with polycrystalline molybdenum substrate at temperature up to 1385 degrees C. It was in-situ observed that molten Si-3.2B alloy wets and rapidly spreads over the Mo surface. After the high temperature test, the solidified couple was subjected to structural characterization by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction methods. The obtained results revealed that the direct interaction between examined materials under applied testing conditions results in the reactively formed product layer having a thickness of similar to 80 mu m. The following structural features were recognized starting from the surface side: (I) the main product layer composed of columnar-like MoSi2 phase and Mo5Si3 phase; (II) an intermediate layer made of MoB and Mo5SiB2 phases. Although these results give the first indication for designing a novel liquid-assisted fabrication method of Mo-Si-B materials, an existence of porosity in the product layer clearly suggests that a further optimization of the process parameters is necessary.

AB Cobalt sulfide is regarded as a candidate for high-capacity lithium-ion batteries. However, it suffers from large volumetric variation during the charge/discharge cycling. Herein, cobalt sulfide/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite has been fabricated via an unique synthetic methodology with solid cobalt/reduced graphene oxide as the precursor, which can inhibit the agglomeration of cobalt sulfide effectively. In the composite, cobalt sulfide nanoparticles are uniformly embedded in reduced graphene oxide. When utilized in lithium-ion batteries, the nanocomposite demonstrates a high discharge capacity of 796 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles. The superior lithium-ion storage performance can be ascribed to the hybrid nanostructure and the synergistic effect originated from the unique synthetic methodology. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB A new rapid and simple synthesis method of cryptomelane-type octahedral molecular sieve (OMS-2) was proposed, which only required KMnO4 and H2SO4 as reactants and a controlled microwave hydrothermal process. The crystallinity and particle size of OMS-2 were found to gradually increase with the synthesis temperature and time, while the specific surface area decreased. Moreover, the synthesis of pure OMS-2 only required about 5 min at 180 degrees C, which is a lower synthesis time than those of previously reported methods. For the high concentration (100 mg/L) of phenol degradation under full-solar-spectrum irradiation, the removal rates of phenol were all in the range of 67%-73%, but the removal rates of total organic carbon were between similar to 40% and similar to 60%. This indicates that the synthesized OMS-2 had a similar high photocatalytic performance for phenol in a wide temperature and time range. And it can be suitable for industrial application.

AB Nano-carbon spheres with a controllable particle size were prepared by a hydrothermal method, and ZnO nanomaterials with three-dimensional honeycomb structures were successfully fabricated by a liquid-phase coating method using the carbon spheres as the template. The structural and morphological characterizations show that the honeycomb size and pore structure of the honeycomb-structured ZnO nanomaterials can be achieved by adjusting the hydrothermal temperature for preparing carbon spheres and the molar ratio of carbon sphere to zinc acetate. The synthesized ZnO samples exhibit high specific surface area and more surface-active sites. The degradation rate of methylene blue by the honeycomb-structured ZnO nanomaterials with a honeycomb size of 80 nm and a pore wall thickness of 10 nm reaches 95% within 90 min, which exhibits an enhancement of 108% compared with that observed for conventional micron-sized ZnO. It reveals that the structure of honeycomb-like ZnO nanomaterials can be fabricated controllably, further enhancing their surface adsorption capacity and photocatalytic reactivity.

AB Graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) is a relative new nanofiller used to tailor the morphology and properties of immiscible polymer blends. However, the self-agglomeration of GNP in the polymer matrix prevents the improvement in mechanical properties. In this work, a water-soluble polymer, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), was introduced to improve the dispersion of GNP in biodegradable immiscible poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) blends. PLA/PBAT based nanocomposites were prepared by melt-mixing PLA and PBAT with freeze-dried PEO/GNP masterbatch. It is found that a small amount of PEO incorporation (1 wt%) enhances the dispersion of GNP in the dispersed PBAT phase and reduces the complex viscosity of the systems significantly. Moreover, the presence of PEO enhances greatly the toughness and thermal stability of PLA/PBAT/GNP nanocomposites. The effect of the molecular weight of PEO was also addressed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Layered Sn(HPO4)(2) is a potential anode material for lithium ion batteries, but it has the low initial Coulombic efficiency and poor electrical conductivity. To overcome these disadvantages, Sn/Na2Sn(PO4)(2) was synthesized by a one-step ion exchange and chemical deposition, then coated by rGO to form rGO/Sn/Na2Sn(PO4)(2) composite. In the composite, rGO constructs a three-dimensional conductive network structure, and protons in Sn(HPO4)(2) are replaced by Na+ to form Na2Sn(PO4)(2) and Sn nanoparticles are evenly distributed on Na2Sn(PO4)(2) surface. The rGO/Sn/Na2Sn(PO4)(2) as anode for lithium ion batteries not only exhibits decent initial Coulombic efficiency of 60.17%, but also excellent rate capability with specific capacities of 461.9, 361.4, and 289.1 mA h g(-1) at current densities of 2, 5, and 10 A g(-1), respectively. Moreover, compared to Sn(HPO4)(2) and Sn/Na2Sn(PO4)(2), rGO/Sn/Na2Sn(PO4)(2) delivers the superior cyclic stability with specific capacity of 670.7 mA h g(-1) after 120 charge/discharge cycles and electrochemical kinetic property with R-ct of 62.1 Omega, which can be attributed to the three-dimensional network structure formed by rGO.

AB In order to reduce the radiation and interference of electromagnetic waves, rational assembly of dielectric materials and magnetic materials is becoming a promising strategy to produce highly efficient microwave absorbers. Herein, a novel kind of ternary nanocomposites, multi-wall carbon nanotubes decorated plate-like BaFe12O19@ZnFe2O4 (BaFe12O19@ZnFe2O4/MWCNTs), was fabricated via a two-step method. Plate-like BaFe12O19 was prepared firstly as a template for the growth of ZnFe2O4 layer, forming a core-shell structure. MWCNTs dispersed between BaFe12O19@ZnFe2O4 particles and ZnFe2O4 microspheres, forming three-dimensional (3D) conductive networks. The careful design of the structure and the combination of the dielectric material with the hard-soft magnetic material caused excellent impedance matching and multiple loss mechanisms, which endow the ternary hybrids with remarkable microwave absorption performance.

AB The analysis of structure, phase composition and tribological properties of surface layers of hypoeutectic silumin after complex treatment including the electroexplosion alloying by yttrium oxide powder in different modes and subsequent electron beam processing was done by the methods of modern physical material science. The complex treatment is accompanied by the formation of multi-phase submicro - nanocrystalline layer up to 80 mu m thick enriched by yttrium atoms and being responsible for the increase in wear resistance. It is shown that Y atom concentration in the modified layer depends on electroexplosion alloying (EEA) mode. The distribution of Y atoms in the layer depends on the mode of EEA as well.

The results showed that maximum tensile strength of 58.5 MPa was acquired for bonded joint made at 825 degrees C. At titanium alloy side, due to formation Ti-Co phases, such as TiCo3, TiCo2, TiCo and CoTi2, brittleness of bonded joints was enhanced. Furthermore, with increase in bonding temperature, tensile strength of bonded joints gradually decreased because of the production of Ti-Co intermetallic compounds with a thicker thickness.

AB Pure egg albumen fiber has potential applications in the food industry, biomedicine, drug-controlled release systems, and as a tissue engineering scaffold. However, this type of fiber has not been successfully prepared so far. In this study, pure egg albumen fiber was successfully prepared using the simple method of coaxial wet-spinning with a polysulfone (PSU) hollow fiber as a template. PSU solution and egg albumen solution were extruded into a coagulation bath of distilled water to fabricate egg albumen/PSU fiber, in which the egg albumen solution was wrapped up by the outside PSU layer. Continuous pure egg albumen fiber was obtained after heat treatment in hot water and removal of the PSU layer by dissolution in N, N-dimethylformamide. The prepared continuous egg albumen fiber with good gloss could be lifted along the axial direction. Scanning electron micrographs revealed a dense structure. This successful preparation of pure egg albumen fiber will enable the manufacture of egg albumen fiber composites with excellent application potential for tissue engineering scaffolds.

AB The effect of ytterbium oxide ((Yb2O3)-Yb-174) deposition in modifying the materials and electrical properties of mechanically rolled tantalum (MRTa) thin foil is investigated through electron microscopic, crystallographic, elemental analysis, and current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. A 0.82 mu m thick layer of (Yb2O3)-Yb-174 over similar to 2.1 mu m thick MRTa foil (Yb2O3/Ta) reduces the dimension of surface features, and indicates formation of nanoparticles. The electron beam imaging, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis reveal formation of uniformly distributed Yb2O3 on MRTa surface and chemical inertness of the newly formed Yb2O3/MRTa thin film towards oxidation. The room temperature I-V characteristics of both the MRTa foil and Yb2O3/MRTa thin film tested with silver (Ag) top contact electrodes exhibit ohmic conductions and demonstrate an overall enhancement of 92.1% in electrical conductivity after Yb2O3 thin film deposition on MRTa foil.

The modifiers were polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The adsorption effect of POSS-SDS-B on methylene blue was also studied. The POSS-SDS-B was characterized by XRD, SEM, TGA and DSC. The results showed that the layer spacing and thermal stability of the nanocomposite POSS-SDS-B were greater than those of the bentonite. The maximum adsorption capacity for methylene blue is 312.51 mg.g(-1) at 25 degrees C and at a natural pH value. POSS-SDS-B can be used as a cost-effective adsorbent to remove contaminants from wastewater. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Food waste, a common municipal domestic organic waste, has been successfully converted into porous carbon with abundant edge defects as electrode materials for supercapacitors. Owning to the synergistic effect of the edge defects and porous structure, the as-obtained porous carbon electrode exhibited super-high specific capacitance of 442 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1) in three-electrode system using 6 M KOH as electrolyte. Furthermore, the specific capacitance at a current density of 10 A g(-1) remained 94.41% after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles, indicating a superior cycling stability of the food waste-derived porous carbon electrode. This study could inspire a new paradigm in recycling food waste into promising porous carbon with desirable characteristics for energy storage. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SEGREGATION
AB FeCrAl alloys are promising materials for fuel cladding in light water reactors due to their high-temperature oxidation resistance in a steam environment. In this study, microstructural analysis revealed that Cr-C precipitation is enhanced in a severely plastically deformed (SPD) Fe-21Cr-5Al alloy [Kanthal-D (KD)], as compared to that in a coarse grained (CG) specimen. SPD was performed using equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) and high-pressure torsion (HPT). The enhanced precipitation is attributed to an increase in the volume fraction of grain boundaries (GB) and to enhanced diffusion owing to increased point defects during ECAP and HPT.

AB At present, the lithium-rich metal oxide Li1+zMO2 (M = Ni, Co, Mn, etc.) is one of the promising cathodes materials for high-energy lithium-ion batteries. In this work, we report the effect of different doping amounts of fluoride ions on the microstructural and electrochemical properties of Li [Li0.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13]O-2 cathode material. At low doping levels, the fluoride ions substituted the oxygen ions. When the doped fluorine was more than the theoretical limit of x = 0.15, LiF-based material was attached on the surface of the material, offering better cycling performance of battery. With the doping effect, a discharge capacity of 230 mAh/g and a capacity retention rate of 98% were found respectively, which are better than the pristine electrode. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Chronic osteomyelitis is featured with serious infection and bone loss. In this study, multifunctional bone scaffolds composed of polyurethane (PU) scaffold loaded with nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HA) and ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (CF) were fabricated. The composite scaffolds could release CF sustainably for at least 2 weeks and exhibited excellent antibacterial activity. The n-HA component in the scaffolds effectively promoted the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of rat-bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Therefore, the prepared HA/PU-CF composite scaffolds are a functional candidate as space maintainer for the treatment of osteomyelitis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Titanium implants fabricated by micro-arc oxidation (MAO) are widely used in orthopedic therapies. However, TiO2 is a bio-inert material and lacks antibacterial properties. Therefore, it is crucial to enhance the biological activity and antibacterial properties of MAO implants. In this work, TiO2 coatings were fabricated by MAO and further hydrogen plasma immersion ion implantation (H-PIII). The formation of Ti-OH bonds promoted cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. The presence of Ti3+ and oxygen vacancies narrowed the forbidden band of TiO2 and showed bacteriostatic effect to E. coli. and S. aureus. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aged Ni-rich NiTi shape memory alloys (SMAs) exhibit the multi-stage martensitic transformation (MMT), which has important influences on functional properties and practical applications of the NiTi SMAs. A hidden single-stage martensitic transformation from B2 parent phase to B19' martensite phase is found in an aged Ni51Ti49 alloy, which happens concurrently with a commonly observed two-stage martensitic transformation B2-R-B19' (R: martensite phase) and actually composes one stage of a multi-stage martensitic transformation (MMT) together with the two-stage one. B2-B19' martensitic transformation occurs in the NiTi matrix containing Ni4Ti3 precipitates with relatively large inter-particle space, while B2-R-B19' transformation takes place in the NiTi matrix with Ni4Ti3 precipitates having relatively small inter-particle space.

ID REACTIVITY
AB Organic-inorganic layered hybrids (OILHs) were synthesized by the copolymerization of organo alkoxysilane and metal salt. Nanoparticles were observed in the resulting OILHs using atomic force microscopy, while the inner structure was a speculative model based on X-ray diffraction and infrared absorption measurements. As the characterization using transmission electron microscopy did not result in clear images because of possible radiation damage, small-angle X-ray scattering and small-angle neutron scattering were measured for the dispersions of two types of OILHs containing Ti or Al. After the spectra were fitted using a flat cylinder model, it was determined that the OILHs have a core-shell structure of a clay sheet surrounded by organic layers. The difference in the dimensions of the core-shell structure for the Ti-containing OILH and the Al-containing OILH was quantitatively demonstrated. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper introduces a novel method to moderate the residual stress in a YSZ/Ti6Al4V alloy by using novel CuO nanostructure reinforced Cu foam (N-Cu foam) interlayer. The microstructure of the CuO nanostructure reinforced Cu foam interlayer and the achieved brazing joint is characterised via scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It is found that nano-CuO structures can be successfully fabricated on the skeleton of the Cu foam and the 3D porous structure of which survives after the brazing process. The achieved brazing seam mainly consists of Ag solid solution (Ag(s,s)), Cu solid solution (Cu(s,s)) and fine Ti3Cu3O secondary phases, which is found to be beneficial to release the thermal stress. The strength of the joint achieved with an N-Cu foam interlayer is 95.6 MPa, which is 83.1% higher than the joints brazed without interlayers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two dimensional (2D) nanosheets to nanoplatelets (NPLs) conversion can be done by controlling the interaction of ligand or surfactant with three dimensional (3D) CsPbBr3 nanocubes. Unlike the involvement of freely interacting surfactants in such transformation, herein, the surfactant molecules were grouped together on gold nanocluster (AuNC) surface to bind the 2D nanosheets into platelets which are much larger in size than those reported previously. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was used as coating over water soluble glutathione protected AuNCs to formulate the hydrophobic CTAB@GSH-Au nanocomposites. Bright emission from the perovskite was quenched by the AuNCs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE CdTe nanowires; Flexible/transparent substrate; Anodized aluminum oxide;
   Conductive atomic force microscope
AB Vertical cadmium telluride (CdTe) nanowires were grown on flexible/transparent substrates by sputtering ITO and aluminum thin films on Parylene substrates, anodizing aluminum to form porous alumina, followed by electrodeposition of CdTe nanowires from ITO seed layer. The pore size of anodized alumina was controlled by oxalic acid concentration and applied voltage. The composition of CdTe nanowires were tuned by adjusting applied deposition potential and solution composition. I-V characteristics of a single 50 nm in diameter CdTe nanowire was examined using a conductive atomic force microscope (CAFM) at room temperature which indicates that the electrical resistivity of electrodeposited CdTe nanowires are similar to thin-film counterpart.

AB Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and silver (Ag) co-modified titanium (IV) oxide (TiO2) was developed and employed as electron transport layer (ETL) in organic solar cell (OSC) to improve electron extraction and transport. The morphological, optical and electrical properties of the ETL were investigated using X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy and photocurrent density-voltage measurement. The OSC exhibited maximum power conversion efficiency of 1.7% which is 30% and 13% higher than devices based on pristine TiO2 and g-C3N4/TiO2 nanocomposite, respectively. The enhancement of OSC performance was primarily ascribed to (1) smoother surface of ETL ensuring good interfacial adhesion between ETL and polymer layer, (2) enhanced light scattering effect and (3) effective electron collection and suppressed recombination at ETL/polymer interface.

In the core/shell nanostructure, the outer Al2O3 layer protects ZnO from interference gases, while the pores allow the target gas to react with the oxygen specie on the surface of ZnO. For as-built ZnO@Al2O3 NCBs sensors, the detection limit is as low as 1 ppm, and the response value to 50 ppm 3H-2B is 37.2 at 300 degrees C. Moreover, the ZnO@Al2O3 NCBs show excellent selectivity and cyclic stability. Our ZnO@Al2O3 NCBs sensors in future monitoring Listeria monocytogenes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we propose a novel material design method, and develop a multicomponent P2-type layered sodium oxide Na2/3Mn0.67Ni0.22Cu0.05Ti0.02Al0.02O2 (NaMNCTAI). This multicomponent material can combine the advantages and functionalities of multiple different metal ions. In the designed NaMNCTAI, Cu element can provide new redox center, Ti element can enlarge interslab distance, Al element can reduce Jahn-Teller distortion. The synergy effect from such a multicomponent design can result in enhanced electrochemical kinetics and structural stability of NaMNCTAI. When used as cathode for sodium-ion batteries, the NaMNCTAI displays an unprecedented electrochemical performance of both ultra-long cycle life (87.8% capacity retention over 400 cycles at 1.0 C rate) and ultra-high rate capability (72.7 mAh g (1) at 10 C). This design strategy based on multicomponent can provide new avenues for designing advanced cathode materials with superior comprehensive performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The near-nano hardmetal with 10% Co has a significantly improved combination of hardness, wear-resistance and fracture toughness in comparison with a conventional ultra-fine hardmetal grade with 10% Co. The wear-resistance of the novel near-nano hardmetals is exceptionally high due to their high hardness, extremely fine microstructure and consequently a low Co mean free path among WC grains.

AB Most of the reported sintered-silver bonding was done on substrates metallized with silver or gold. There is lacking in reports of strong sintered-silver bonding on nickel (Ni), a common and low-cost metallization on substrates, due to nickel oxidation at sintering temperature. In this study, we proposed a dieattach method on nickel by pressureless in-air sintering a trimodal hybrid-silver paste. Thanks to the strong cohesion of densification bond-line from close packing of trimodal-silver particles and adhesion from metallic bonds at Ag-Ni interface by prevention nickel from extensive oxidation, strong die-shear strength above 40 MPa was achieved. The results presented in this study open a way to achieve strong sintered-silver bonding on nickel metallization. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The discharge capacities of pristine LNMO are only 125.7, 107.3, 86.2, 69.7 and 37.6 mAh g(-1) at homologous rates. The V2O5 modification can be considered as an efficient way to enhance the rate capability of LNMO. The improved rate capability of V2O5-coated LNMO material could be ascribed to the enhanced lithium-ions diffusion coefficient and reduced charge-transfer reaction resistance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ID PHASE-TRANSITION; BEHAVIOR
AB Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a major issue in the aeronautic field, especially for impact detection on composite materials which can be time consuming. Impact-sensitive coatings are an interesting way to save costs and time associated with these monitoring operations. This paper describes the successful preparation of a reversible piezochromic coating for impacts detection on composite substrates. It results from the incorporation of piezochromic pigments into a hybrid organic-inorganic matrix. It has been optimized by studying and quantifying their piezochromic behavior by UV-visible spectroscopy. It revealed that the piezochromic properties of the sensitive coating and the pigments alone are quite different and ruled by the hardness of the film. The obtained sensitivity and threshold pressure are determined to be 28% GPa(-1) and 0.2 GPa respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fe-doped hydroxyapatite (HA) nanocages were firstly synthesized using cheap and readily available potassium mono-dodecyl phosphate as the micelle template agent. The incorporation of Fe into HA crystal lattices makes the hollow structure of Fe-doped HA nanocages resist the shrinkage caused by calcination. The obtained Fe-doped HA nanocages have a size of 80-100 nm, a mesoporous shell with a thickness of 12 nm, a specific surface area of 80.1973 m(2)/g and a pore volume of 0.43298 cm(3)/g. The nanocages have a highly efficient and selective adsorption for Cd2+ as well as a superparamagnetic property. The magnetic characteristic and the outstanding adsorption property for heavy metal ions of Fe-doped HA nanocages provide evidence that the material has a great promise for wastewater treatment.

AB TiO2 nanospheres/AgVO3 quantum dots composite was synthesized by a facile in situ ultrasonic reaction route and systematically characterized by XRD, XPS, FESEM, TEM, UV-DRS and PL. The results demonstrated that AgVO3 QDs were successfully anchored on the surface of TiO2 nanospheres. The TiO2/AgVO3 composite displayed a high and stable visible light photocatalytic inactivation activity toward E. coll., which mainly derived from the synergetic effect between TiO2 and AgVO3, including a good distribution of AgVO3 QDs on the surface of TiO2 nanospheres, increased visible light harvesting and improved separation efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole pairs. Our study revealed that TiO2/AgVO3 composite could be a promising candidate photocatalyst for treating microbial-contaminated water. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Transparent electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials are highly in demand for liquid crystal display, communication devices and observation windows. In this study, two polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates, one printed with a silver-grid and the other coated with silver nanowires and reduced graphene oxide (AgNWs/rGO), were prepared separately and hot-pressed together face-to-face to fabricate hybrid films composed of sliver-grid/(AgNWs/rGO). The rGO nanosheets act as bridges between silver nanowires and vice-versa which can facilitate fast transfer of electrons. The effects of grid-line spacing on the transparency and EMI shielding have been studied. It is found that the EMI shielding increases with decreasing the grid-lines spacing, however, resulting in decrease of the transparency. The silver-grid/(silver nanowires and reduced graphene oxide) sample with 1.0 mm grid-line spacing demonstrates highest EMI shielding of 42.94 dB along with a low sheet resistance of 1.60 52/sq and a high transparency of 74.40%.

ID SOLUBILITY
AB Various Li-doped TiO2 films with different doping concentration were successfully synthesized by a thermal treatment at 500 degrees C. With the incorporation of Li+, anatase TiO2 transformed obviously to rutile at lower temperature (500 degrees C) and the increasing concentration of Li+ can promote the growth of crystals. All films have good transmittance (average transmittance >75%) in the visible region, the optical band gap (Eg) of TiO2 narrowed from 3.71 eV to 3.63 eV and reached the minimum at 5.0 mol%. Moreover, an optimized carrier concentration of 6.43 * 10(10) cm(3) and the resistivity of 4.06 * 10(5) Omega.cm were obtained after 5.0 mol% Li+ doping. Possible mechanisms for the effect of Li-doping on the carrier concentration and resistivity were discussed. In conclusion, the Li-doped TiO2 films have potential applications for solar cell.

AB ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles decorated delaminated Ti3C2Tx nanosheet composite (ZnFe2O4/Ti3C2Tx) was successfully fabricated by ultrasound treatment followed by a freeze drying method. Numerous ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles with a size less than 5 nm are evenly distributed on the surface of Ti3C2Tx nanosheet. The ZnFe2O4/Ti3C2Tx as an anode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 436 mAh g(-1), which is higher than that of Ti3C2Tx nanosheet and ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles after 100 cycles. The good electrochemical result is dependent on the synergistic effect of small sized ZnFe2O4 with high capacity and layered Ti3C2Tx nanosheet with high conductivity. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Usually, positive magnetoresistance (PMR) is observed in graphene foam (GF) under all temperature and magnetic field range. Herein, large negative magnetoresistance is observed under a temperature range 300-200 K which switches to PMR under a temperature range 200-5 K in graphene foam (GF)Ecoflex (R) specimen. The GF-Ecoflex (R) shows NMR in highly crosslinked specimen, while lightly crosslinked shows PMR at room temperature. This indicates that the sign of magnetoresistance can be controlled by controlling viscoelasticity of Ecoflex (R) in GF-Ecoflex (R) specimens, which is very useful for wearable magnetoelectronics.

AB Here, we report a magnetic reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite consisting of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and iron nanoparticles in the range of 15-20 nm. The nanocomposite has been prepared by impregnation of RGO with iron acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)(3)) using acetone, followed by thermal decomposition of iron precursor loaded on RGO at 800 degrees C in an inert atmosphere. Magnetic reduced graphene oxide (Fe/RGO) was characterized using SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman and VSM. Fe/RGO epoxy nanocomposite shows enhanced electromagnetic properties compared to Fe epoxy nanocomposite due to enhanced interfacial and electric polarization. The hybrids of Fe nanoparticles and RGO in this work are potential to serve as an attractive electromagnetic absorption materials. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The solid solution Sr0.5Ca0.5Mn1-xVxO3-delta (0 <= x <= 0.125) has been obtained via a citrate-nitrate synthesis route. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data for x = 0, 0.025 and 0.05 reveal the formation of perovskite type orthorhombic structure with Pbnm space group (SG). Further increase of the vanadium content results in the appearance of the tetragonal crystal structure (SG 14/mcm) so that the composition of x = 0.075 is formed by the orthorhombic and tetragonal phase constituents in the 1:3 vol ratio. The single-phase sample at x = 0.1 is characterized by tetragonal symmetry of its unit cell. The comparison between the calculated (XRD) and pycnometric density values is indicative of 6-fold oxygen coordination of vanadium dopants. High-temperature electrical conductivity (sigma) and Seebeck coefficient (S) measurements give evidence to the presence of electronic charge carriers that can be associated with Mn 3-1 cations appearing in response to vanadium doping. The largest thermoelectric power factor S-2 sigma = 1.5 mu W.K-2.cm (1) is attained in the two-phase composition x = 0.075 at 450 degrees C. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, three-dimensional (3D) ZIF-8-derived carbon (ZIF-8C) polyhedrons have been successfully coated with polydopamine (PDA) nanothin layer via a facile synthetic method that exploits oxidative self polymerization of dopamine in alkaline solutions. It is observed that ca. 20 nm of PDA nanothin film is coated on ZIF-8C surface with a good homogeneity. Our results show clear morphological changes in core-shell structured PDA-coated ZIF-8C (ZIF-8C@PDA) as compared to bare ZIF-8C. In addition, the cyclic voltammetry shows conspicuous redox peaks in ZIF-8C@PDA. The observed redox activity is attributed to a series of redox reactions of oxygen species of catechol and quinone groups of PDA. With superior adhesive property and redox activity as additional surface functionality, ZIF-8C@PDA can be used in various applications, especially in energy storage applications in the future.

AB In this work, Bi2S3/BiOBr hybrid structure has been prepared via ion exchange method. The hybrid structure has enhanced light harvesting ability and improved transfer efficiency of photogenerated carriers thanks to the narrow bandgap of Bi2S3 and staggered band structure of Bi2S3/BiOBr hybrid structure. As a result, Bi2S3/BiOBr hybrid structure exhibits improved photocatalytic N-2 fixation performance compared with BiOBr and excellent stability after 4 cycles of photocatalytic nitrogen fixation under visible light irradiation.

AB A simple and efficient method to grow continuous large-area ZnO/MoS2 heterostructures is demonstrated by pulsed laser deposition. The layer number of MoS2 films is controlled by the number of laser pulses. The MoS2 film acts as a closely lattice-matched buffer layer for the subsequent ZnO growth, which improves the structural and optical quality of the ZnO film. ZnO film and multilayer MoS2 forms a type-II heterostructure, and the band offsets between them are quantitatively determined. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A series of ceramic monolith (cordierite, corundum and mullite-cordierite) supported La0.8Ce0.2MnO3 catalysts for toluene oxidation were prepared and characterized to study the structure-activity relationship. The effects of loading and support were investigated by discussing the specific surface area, reduction ability, oxygen vacancies, and toluene oxidation efficiency. Finally, the optimum catalyst was obtained; when loading of La0.8Ce0.2MnO3 was 15 wt% and the carrier was cordierite, the catalyst exhibited the largest specific surface area (21.4 m(2).g-(1)) and best toluene conversion (T-50 = 167 degrees C, T-90 = 273 degrees C).

AB xCsHSO(4)-(100-x)H4SiW12O40 was synthesized from cesium hydrogen sulfate and silicotungstic acid by a mechanical milling method then applied to a three-phase interface as a novel solid ionomer. Impedance and SEM analyses confirmed that 80CsHSO(4)-20H(4)SiW(12)O(40) is the optimum composition for high ionic conductivity and good electrochemical stability. When 80CsHSO(4)-20H(4) SiW12O40 was applied to the catalyst surface in order to enhance mass transportation in the three-phase interface, the maximum power density of the fuel cell at 150 degrees C was improved from 230 to 327 mW cm(2). The cell voltage stability was also confirmed for 24 h. Furthermore, activation voltage is reduced when 80CsHSO(4)-20H(4)SiW(12)O(40) was applied to the cathode electrode. Applying 80CsHSO(4)-20H(4)SiW(12)O(40) to the three-phase interface is effective for improvement of power density and stability as well as suppressing the activation overvoltage of medium-temperature fuel cells under an anhydrous condition.

DE Flexible supercapacitor; Lithium electrolyte; Graphene composite
ID OXIDE
AB This work reports a novel method for the fabrication of supercapacitors (SCs) which employs flexible graphene electrodes (FGEs), an aqueous Li electrolyte, and a separator (semipermeable membrane) between electrodes. In some devices, the Li electrolyte was improved with the addition of BMIMBF4-an Ionic liquid (IL), which enhanced the gravimetric capacitance of the devices, reaching a maximum value of 1558 F/g. Moreover, the presence of the IL enhanced from 272 to 800 min the discharge time, which suggests that the SCs release their energy as slow as batteries. In addition, the thickness of the separator was increased from 200 to 400 mu m, which allows stabilizing the discharge time for at least 120 min. Thus, the proposed combination of FGEs and electrolytes will open the opportunity to develop SCs with discharge cycles comparable to Li-based batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report the electrical properties of p(++)-Si-Al2O3-MoSe2 metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors using capacitance-voltage measurement. The capacitance-voltage characteristics with distinct accumulation, depletion, and inversion regions revealed n-type doping in MoSe2. The estimated doping concentration and interface trap density were similar to 10(18) cm(-3) and similar to 10(12) eV(-1) cm(-2), respectively. The accumulation capacitance showed relatively low frequency dispersion suggesting lower border trap density in Al2O3-MoSe2 devices than that in Al2O3-MoS2 devices. These results suggest that it is possible to obtain high-quality Al2O3-MoSe2 interface, highlighting the versatility of capacitance-voltage measurements on the device integration of MoSe2 and other two-dimensional semiconductors.

AB TiB2 reinforced aluminum metal matrix composites (MMCs) were in-situ synthesized by laser surface alloying (LSA). SEM, XRD and EBSD were used to investigate the effect of TiB2 particles on the microstructure characteristics, phase constitution and crystallographic orientation. The results indicated that TiB2 particles mainly exhibited hexagonal plate-like morphology and distributed at high angle grain boundaries (HAGBs). The average grain size of the composites decreased with increasing TiB2 content, and the crystallographic orientation changed from (0 0 1) orientation to (1 1 1) and (1 0 1) orientations. The composites exhibited enhanced nanohardness of 2.74 +/- 0.08 GPa, which was about 9.5 times of the matrix. Dislocation strengthening (Delta sigma(CTE)) and dispersion strengthening (Delta sigma(Orowan)) played dominating role in strengthening mechanism. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we synthesized hydroxyapatite-coated ferroferric oxide (HA/Fe3O4) microspheres by a convenient hydrothermal method. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy (Raman) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed that HA/Fe3O4 microspheres with an average particle size of similar to 1 mu m were successfully synthesized. The biocompatibility of HA/Fe3O4 samples was evaluated by cell viability and Live/Dead staining of MG-63 cell lines. The experimental results showed that these HA/Fe3O4 microspheres were favorable to proliferation of MG-63 cells. These synthesized microspheres may be potentially attractive biomaterials for bone tissue engineering applications. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, a new method (swift heavy-ion (SHI) irradiation) has been adopted to develop the lightweight nano-magnetite/exfoliated-nanographite/polymethylmethacrylate (Fe3O4/NG/PMMA) nanocomposites with strong and broadband MW absorbing characteristics. The effects of SHI [C6+(80 MeV) and O7+(100 MeV)] irradiation on MW-absorbing properties of Fe3O4/NG/PMMA nanocomposites were investigated in 2-18 GHz frequency range. Irradiated nanocomposites demonstrated better homogenization of nanofillers, lower saturation magnetization, higher coercivity, stronger MW-absorption and higher effective bandwidth of absorption. Nanocomposites irradiated with O7+(100 MeV) ions at fluence of 1 x 10(12) ions/cm(2) exhibited a minimum reflection loss (R-Lmin) of -32.4 dB (99.94% MW-absorption) and broad bandwidth (for R-L <= -10 dB) of similar to 6.8 GHz.

AB In this work, the ceramic matrix abradable sealing coating of yttria-stabilized zirconia was successfully prepared with a novel technology of Sol precursor plasma spraying. Compared with the traditional SPPS technology, the deposition efficiency of Sol precursor spraying was dramatically improved. The friction coefficient of the Sol precursor coating significantly decreased, while the bond strength was increased. Additionally, the Sol precursor coating has a loose microstructure and exhibits the steadily tetragonal zirconia phase structure. The Sol precursor plasma spraying technology is an effective process that enhances deposition efficiency, and also to increases the application properties of the coating material on a large scale.

AB Conductive superhydrophobic cotton fabric was fabricated by assembling carboxylated and aminated multiwalled carbon nanotubes and modifying with polydimethylsiloxane. The cotton fabric possessed superhydrophobicity with a CA of 162 degrees, and was successfully applied in oil-water separation with high separation efficiency and great reusability. Additionally, the conductive fabric-based pressure sensor exhibited stable and regular responses in human motion detection including finger bending, wrist movement, walking and running. Owing to the excellent water repellency of the fabric, the pressure sensor could work even under wet and humid conditions, which may pave a novel way to further broaden application field in high-performance electric sensors.

AB Understanding the formation of cleavage fracture is meaningful for cutting silicon in ductile mode. In this study, the (0 0 1) single crystal silicon was cut along < 1 0 0 > direction with plunging angles of 0.07 degrees, 0.12 degrees and 0.17 degrees. Three regions with characteristics of ductile removal, cleavage and random fractures were observed on the cutting grooves. Increase in the plunging angles not only contributes to the large critical depth of cut, but also reduces the cleavage length due to the enhancement of hydrostatic pressures. Besides, the {1 1 1} plane is the potential plane for the initiation and propagation of cleavage fractures during plunge cutting the silicon along < 1 0 0 > direction. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Fully-dense and single-phase nanostructured scandia-stabilized zirconia specimens were produced by high-pressure spark plasma sintering technique. Nanocrystalline powders were prepared by the copre-cipitation method. Green pellets were sintered at temperatures varying from 700 to 900 degrees C and pressures from 1.4 to 2 GPa, resulting in dense microstructures with single-phase fluorite-type cubic structure within a wide range of Sc2O3 content (6-15 mol%). The average grain size of sintered specimens ranged from 8 to 20 nm. Transmittance spectra confirm translucence in sintered specimens, which is consistent with full density. The results reported here reveal that the polymorphism challenge in the zirconia-scandia system can be successfully suppressed by this consolidation technique, which allows for controlling the grain size of bulk specimens.

ID STRATEGY
AB Herein, we report the electrochemical properties such as self-discharge, leakage current and voltage holding tests (VHTs) of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) based solid-state symmetric supercapacitors (SSCs). SSC device demonstrates wide potential window (1.2 V), high specific capacity of 110.3 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), high energy density of 22.1 W h kg(-1) and ultra-high power density of 7304.5 W kg(-1) . Further, SSC device depicts the high stability of 89.4% after 10,000 galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) cycles and 82.3% after 20 h VHTs. It also shows the small leakage current of 0.029 mA. Furthermore, SSC device retains the voltage of 0.7 V of its initial voltage (1.2 V) after 1 h self-discharge test, which suggests good state of health of the SSC device. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Porous carbonaceous networks decorated with functional nanoparticles are highly demanded in diverse applications as their good conductivity nature as well as cheap source offers a cost-affordable alternative among numerous options. In this work, we report a new and facile strategy to prepare three-dimensional (3D) Au/C networks comprised of carbonaceous skeletons and tiny gold nanoparticles by directly carbonizing the nanoporous block copolymer films complexed with the gold salts. The robust complexation makes it ease of generating numerous dispersed gold nanoparticles with an average diameter as small as approximate to 15 nm confined in the carbonaceous frameworks after carbonization. Thus-developed Au/C networks are highly expected to find widespread applications such as catalysis, sensing, etc. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hierarchical hollow CeVO4 microspheres with average size about 5 mu m and the thickness of shell walls about 500 nm were fabricated via a simple hydrothermal method with L-Aspartic acid (L-Asp) as the structure-directing agent. SEM results indicate that hierarchical hollow CeVO4 microspheres are assembled by numerous nanoflakes with thickness of 30-40 nm. The dimensions and hollowness of the hollow microspheres can be tailored via the appropriate controlling of reaction time and the amount of L-Asp. N-2 adsorption-desorption measurements revealed the BET surface area of the nanoflakes-assembled CeVO4 hollow microspheres was 98.24 m(2)/g. The photocatalytic properties of CeVO4 were investigated by the degradation of methylene orange (MO) under UV light irradiation. This excellent performance can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of hollow nature and hierarchical structures, which endowing CeVO4 great potential for purifying organic pollutants.

ID SOLID-ELECTROLYTE INTERPHASE; PHOSPHORUS
AB Cu2P7-black P-MWCNT (CuP5/MWCNT) is prepared by a facile mechanical milling method. When used as anodes for Li/Na-ion batteries, the composite delivers high comprehensive performances: initial Coulombic efficiency up to 90/84%, 1455/1170 mA h g (1) after 200 cycles, and 960/580 mA h g (1) at 5 A g (1) for Li/Na-ion batteries, respectively. The performances can be attributed to the hybridized strategy of two-dimension layered structure of Cu2P7, black P, and one-dimension multiwall carbon nanotubes. The former offers a fast transport channel for Li/Na-ions and the latter provides for fast transport of electrons and accommodates the volume variation during cycling. In addition, the synergistic effect among different phases also leads to enhanced performance. The integrated strategy of one-dimensional and two-dimensional advantages can excite more research interest in the energy-storage field. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mechanical properties of casting alloys are generally limited. To make casting alloys applicable for a high level of service environments, a novel casting eutectic high entropy alloy (EHEA) with excellent mechanical properties is proposed. The hierarchical microstructures are with fine regular lamellar eutectic and coarse irregular eutectic. The eutectics consist of face-centered cubic (FCC) and ordered body-centered cubic (B2) phases with the semi-coherent interface. In the as-cast state, it shows a tensile strength of 1266.5 MPa and elongation of 20.3%. The unusual as-cast properties make it possible to manufacture high performance products by direct casting.

ID ADSORPTION
AB Purifying and functionalising multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are important processes for providing property modifications, improving handling and enhancing reactivity. The removal of impurities allows avoiding synthesis process interferences and the formation of by-products. During the process it is possible to change the MWCNT properties, e.g. providing enhanced hydrophilicity and better chemical reactivity. In this work, a two-step procedure of MWCNT functionalisation with non-oxidative and oxidative agents is presented. Firstly, hydrochloric acid was used to remove catalyst impurities, which remain after the synthesis process. Secondly, nitric acid was employed to oxidise the MWCNT surfaces and incorporate carboxylic groups onto the surface. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID MOBILITY
AB The needle-like surface morphology evolution in oxygen plasma in combination with a secondary gas (Cl-2, CHF3 or CF4) by inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE) on a free-standing polycrystalline diamond was investigated. The addition of CF4 can produce trans-polyacetylene (t-PA), which is similar to the result when the pure O-2 etching takes place, and generate compact needle-tip particles. However, the t-PA disappears with the introduction of Cl or H ions. The optimised etching parameters for the needle-like structure formation are as following: Cl-2/O-2 ratio 20% and RF-power (RFP) 100 W, where more compact and even nano-needles are realised with an average etching rate of 2 mu m/min. The Cl-2/O-2 plasma etching results indicate that the time-dependent etching mechanism of diamond nano-needles results from (1 1 1) crystal plane selective etching and preferential graphitisation at the twin-plane boundary and dislocation area.

AB Layered CoTMPyP/SrTa2O7 nanocomposite was fabricated by the ion-exchange method of inserting 5, 10, 15, 20-tetrakis (N-methylpyridinium-4-yl) porphyrinato cobalt (III) (CoTMPyP) into the interlayer of Bi2SrTa2O9. CoTMPyP cation forms a monolayer inclined to the [SrTa2O7](2) nanosheets at an angle of about 70 degrees. The electrochemical qualities of the CoTMPyP/SrTa2O7 nanocomposite were studied by cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. The results showed that the nanocomposite modified electrode exhibited great electrocatalytic activity toward oxidation of nitrite in the neutral solution and the oxidation process on the surface of modified electrode was controlled by diffusion. Furthermore, a detection limit for nitrite was calculated as 1.40 x 10(-)(5) M with a linear concentration detection range from 0.29 to 3.31 mM. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A synthetic method has been developed to obtain the material by an efficient post-synthetic modification technique that allows 95% functionalization of active sites of the precursor material (UiO-68-NH2). This material has revealed to be stable in aggressive conditions ([SO42] = 1 M, pH = 2) and to extract uranium up to 25 mg g(-1), thus showing for the first time the possibility to use these hybrid materials for such an application.

AB Mosquito repellent textiles are increasingly in demand from consumers as protective textiles against mosquito-borne diseases like malaria, yellow fever or dengue. In this work, the production and behaviour of repellent-containing electrospun ethylcellulose nanofibrous mats for the control of disease vectors is presented. Citriodiol (CD), a naturally and sustainably sourced biorepellent, was used as against Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the main insect vector of dengue virus. The effect of electrospinning solvent and CD content and distribution on the morphology of monolithic and core-enriched nanofibers was examined. The effectiveness of these novel CD-loaded nanofibrous mats to repel mosquitoes was assessed using standard methods. The use of biopolymer-based core-enriched nanofibrous mats resulted a very promising strategy for the development of functional nanofibrous textiles containing a natural repellent cargo, such as disposable outdoor goods.

AB Sr2Ti1-x(Mg1/3Nb2/3)(x)O-4 (0 <= x <= 0.4) solid solutions were synthesized by standard solid-state reaction method for the first time, and their microwave dielectric properties were systematically investigated together with the microstructure. X-ray diffraction patterns revealed the formation of solid solutions in the whole composition range, while two kinds of secondary phases started to appear when x = 0.4. With increasing x , the dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) was tuned from 42 to 26.3 and the temperature coefficient of resonant frequency (tau(f)) could be successfully modified from 130 ppm/degrees C to 46.3 ppm/degrees C. Excellent combination of microwave dielectric properties with epsilon(r) = 28.5, Qf = 83,300 GHz, and tau(f )= 53 ppm/degrees C were obtained for the x = 0.3 composition after sintering at 1500 degrees C for 3 h.

AB The successful reconstruction of the skin equivalents that closely resemble normal human skin tissue greatly relies on maintaining the structural integrity throughout the air-liquid culture. Therefore, this study presents a novel strategy to prepare 3D Agarose-Well which enhances structural integrity of reconstructed skin equivalents. Hydrogel forming of agarose with agarose-g-C18, which synthesized a hydrophobically modified agarose, generated the 3D Agarose-Wells that possess various hydrophilic/ hydrophobic balances. As a result, the agarose-fibrils in the well, assembled with penetrated collagen in dermis layer were proved to enhance the structural integrity and further regulate the mechanical strength from 6.8 kPa to 20.9 kPa. Overall, this new strategy to prepare the skin equivalents in the 3D Agarose-Well would be actively used in tissue engineering, drug delivery, and cosmetics, etc. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The basic structural elements, crystallites of the same or different phases, strive to determine the state with the smallest free energy. This leads to a special mutual misorientation of the neighboring grains. In the frame of the research electron backscatter diffraction in scanning electron microscope was used to characterize the crystallographic relationships in calcitic prismatic lamellas forming the outside part of the shell of Pinctada margaritifera.

AB N-polar GaN samples under different V/Ill ratio were grown on bulk N-polar GaN substrates by metal organic chemical vapor deposition. The V/Ill ratio was optimized by adjusting the flow rate of trimethylgallium, meanwhile the flow rate of ammonia is consistent. The samples were characterized by High Resolution X-Ray Diffraction, Raman, photoluminescence and Van-der-Pauw Hall measurement. The best dislocation density of the samples is approximately 3.72 x 10(6) cm(-2) which is three orders of magnitude smaller than the common heteroepitaxy of N-polar GaN. The background carrier concentration of the samples is reduced by about 95% as the flow rate of trimethylgallium decreasing. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The specimens were produced in the form of scaffolds, being obtained from a collagen gel together with two powdered raw materials (commercial hydroxyapatite and laboratory synthesized barium titanate) and then characterized from morphological, compositional and biological point of view. Moreover, a numerical simulation was proposed in order to evaluate the influence of barium titanate nanoparticles on the magnetic properties in four different situations as respects their distribution on a flat surface.

AB CuWO4 nanotubes with wall thickness of 40 +/- 5 nm have been synthesized by facile electrospinning technique. The efficient charge transport paths, large surface area and internal/external surface of the samples synergistically make CuWO4 nanotubes enhanced photocatalysts towards photodegradation of tetracycline under simulated sunlight irradiation. Density functional theory simulations of electronic location function and free energy indicate that CuWO4 nanotubes with highly exposed (0 1 0) crystal plane well establish an electronic transport channel, accelerate the transportation of carriers, which is conducive to photocatalysis. This work not only opens up the possibility of the rational design of tube-like photocatalysts, but also provides the mechanistic insights into photocatalytic mechanism for tungstate nanomaterials.

AB The plastic strain accommodation and recrystallization behavior of the medium-entropy alloy (MEA) CoCrNiCux (x = 0, 0.66, 1 in molar ratio) were investigated. The addition of Cu induced phase separation phenomenon due to the positive mixing enthalpy of Cu with other constituent elements. This resulted in an alteration of the microstructure from a single solid-solution face-centered cubic (FCC) structure to Cu-lean FCC1 and Cu-rich FCC2 phases. Here, a higher recrystallization concentration in the Cu-rich region was observed compared to that of Cu-lean region. This occurred due to the lower hardness of Cu-rich region than Cu-lean region, which caused a greater plastic strain was accommodated in the Cu-rich region than in the Cu-lean region. Consequently, Cu-rich region tended to be more extensively recrystallized compared to that of Cu-lean region. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Ti-13Nb-13Zr-10Cu alloy as new biomedical material was prepared by Ar-arc melting. The microstructure characteristics, mechanical properties and antibacterial properties of Ti-13Nb-13Zr-10Cu alloy after heat treatment were studied. Results show that the Ti-13Nb-13Zr-10Cu alloy is mainly composed of beta-Ti, alpha-Ti, and some Cu-containing phases, e.g. CuZr, Ti2Cu, and Cu10Zr7. With the addition of Cu, the alpha-Ti phase significantly decreased, and some Cu-containing phases appeared in the form of reticular structure, which was mainly consisted of Cu, Zr and Ti elements. The CuZr and Ti2Cu phases in the reticular structure were identified by TEM. Compared with CP-Ti and Ti-13Nb-13Zr alloy, the elastic modulus of Ti-13Nb-13Zr-10Cu alloy was significantly reduced to 66 GPa, but its yield strength and compressive strength still retained at high levels. The Ti-13Nb-13Zr-10Cu alloy after 24 h of culture with S. aureus exhibits an enhanced antibacterial activity. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pyrite is part of the tailings from coal mining and presents a great valorization potential technological, economic and environmental in the production of nanoparticles. In this work, pyrite from coal mining was subjected to high-energy milling and the particle size reduction, electrical and optical properties were evaluated. With the milling parameters used, the apparent size of the crystallites was reduced from 34.7 nm to 23.8 nm, resulting in highly unstable particles and charge carriers with low mobility. Due to this instability, submicron particles were observed, in the range of 300-500 nm, with a hydrodynamic diameter of 1257 +/- 36 nm. The processed pyrite showed good visible light absorption and an indirect band gap of 1.51 eV. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro toxicity of hydroxyapatite previously prepared and doped with gallium in the form of gallium nitrate and sodium gallate. The VERO (ATCC - CCL 81) monkey cells were cultured in typical culture conditions and exposed to tested materials by adaptation of insert wells. After incubation for 48 h, a spectrophotometric test was performed, measuring the absorption at 540 nm. It was shown that, according to the ANOVA test, there was no statistically significant difference between the samples and the control, so hydroxyapatite doped with gallium may be characterized as inert biologically compatible material. These results open up the possibilities of introduction into clinical practice a composite that contains promising less common element gallium and may be appropriate for application in orthopedic implants.

The microstructure and properties of composites were investigated. The nanometer y-Al2O3 distributes uniformly in the matrix and is assumed as gamma-AL(2)O(3) that is a stable phase of Al2O3 when the temperature is lower than 1000 degrees C. The Al/gamma-Al2O3 interface is clean with certain matching degree. High density dislocation has been found around the nano gamma-Al2O3 particles. At the grain boundary the submicron Al9Co2 particles exist, which can restrict the grain boundary moving. The tensile properties of 0.6 vol% gamma-Al2O3 sample arrives at utmost while the 0.8 vol% sample decrease a lot due to the particle agglomeration. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB TiO(2 )is recognized as a promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its low-cost and high structural stability, but it suffers from intrinsically poor electrical conductivity and low electrochemical activity at high rates. Herein, an in-situ Fe-doping strategy is designed to increase sodium-ion storage performance of TiO2/carbon nanofibers by a simple electrospinning method. The combination of Fe-doping with one-dimensional carbon structure could enable fast electron and Na+ ion transport of TiO2. As a result, the Fe-TiO2/carbon nanofiber electrode exhibits high specific capacity (283 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C), excellent rate capability (140 mAh g(-1) at 30 C) and long cycling stability (98% retention after 3000 cycles), which is obviously superior to pure TiO2/carbon nanofiber and other TiO2-based anodes reported in the literatures. These results indicates the powerful effect of in-situ Fe-doping for enhancing the Na-storage property of TiO2. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Magnetic-optical nanocomposites, which consist of iron oxide nanoparticles and quantum dots, have aroused considerable research interest owing to their unique magnetic and luminescent properties. However, the luminescence of quantum dots tends to be quenched by the magnetic component. Resonant Raman scattering (RRS) of semiconductor nanocrystals, which originates from a strong electron-phonon interaction, provides a new candidate property to be exploited as an analytical tool. Herein, Fe3O4/ZnS nanocomposites were prepared with the seed-mediated growth approach. The nanocomposites exhibited superparamagnetism and characteristic multi-order phonon resonant Raman lines. By using biofunctionalized Fe3O4/ZnS nanocomposites as RRS probes, a femtomolar immunoassay of a model protein, human IgG, was realized with the assistance of an external magnetic field. The results provide guidance for the broad applications of magnetic-optical nanocomposites. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   properties; Water resistance
AB To develop high-performance wood materials, a novel preparation strategy is presented in this study. Wood fiber mats impregnated with phenolic resin, were laminated into a densified material. Wood lumens collapsed layer by layer during densification, leading to a compact multi-layered structure. The densified material had excellent mechanical properties and favorable water resistance. The flexural, compressive, and short-beam shearing strength were approximately 230%, 400%, and 260% higher than that of natural wood, respectively. The water absorption rate and thickness swelling rate in boiled water were 19% and 5.7%, respectively. Surface water repellency was also enhanced due to reduction of hydrophilic groups on the surface. Such high performance makes the material a promising candidate for advanced engineering structures and applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biomimetic glycopolymers poly(dopamine methacrylamide-co-lactobionamidoethyl methacrylate) (PDMA-co-PLAMA) based ligand was synthesized, used to effectively reduce the gold ions and anchored on the surface of gold nanoparticles to prepare the glycopolymers modified gold nanoparticles (Gly@AuNPs). The Gly@AuNPs were prepared and stabilized in one step, which did not require classical thiol-containing polymer to stabilize AuNPs. The Gly@AuNPs were found to be highly stable at high salt concentrations (500 mM NaCl) and different pH conditions over a long time. These stable Gly@AuNPs could provide useful information in applications of targeted cancer imaging and photothermal therapy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Experimental results show that UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded to elucidate the role of Mn2+ ions substituted into ZnSe, which resulted in the carrier transfer of luminescent sites by a small amount of Mn2+ dopant. The small size of the Mn-doped ZnSe QDs offers intriguing opportunities for their application in photonic, bioimaging, and spintronics devices. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To obtain ideal flexible and high conductivity nanocomposites, 3 kinds of bacterial cellulose (BC) based nanocomposites were synthesized, including BC-SnO2, BC-polypyrrole (PPy) and BC-SnO2-PPy. The structures of these composites were compared via FTIR, XRD, TGA and FE-SEM. The conductivity and electro-chemical properties were evaluated by CV test and EIS test. The resistance value of BC-SnO2, BC-PPy and BC-SnO2-PPy was 273.5 Omega, 57.9 Omega and 35.9 Omega, respectively, and conductivity was 0.077 S/cm, 1.152 S/cm and 7.246 S/cm, respectively. The bending tests showed the electrochemical properties kept stability at various bending deformations. Results here provide an easy, and environmentally friendly method to synthesize BC-SnO2-PPy which may have potential application as flexible, highly conductive material.

AB Sigma 3 boundaries improve the intergranular corrosion resistance of high nitrogen austenitic stainless steels. However, the regeneration of these boundaries is, unfortunately, accompanied by significant grain coarsening. 18Mn18Cr0.5N and 18Mn18Cr0.6N steels were thermo-mechanically processed and the corresponding microstructures were evaluated. Formation mechanisms were proposed for Sigma 1 boundaries in different R-Sigma 3-Sigma 1 -type junctions. These boundaries formed during grain growth accompanying Sigma 3 formation and reaction. After 30% cold tension and cyclic heating between 500 degrees C and 1100 degrees C, numerous Sigma 1 boundaries were formed and disrupted the high angle grain boundary network efficiently. Moreover, a small grain size was maintained. Sigma 1 boundaries have significant application potential in grain boundary engineering. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The diffusion behavior of Al in FeCoCrNiMo(x )high-entropy alloys (HEAs) at temperatures ranging from 773 to 873 K with and without pulse current was studied in this paper. The diffusion coefficients D was determined based on the Fick's law and corresponding pre-exponential factor D-0, as well as activation energy Q(D). It was found that the D under pulse current dramatically increased about hundreds of times in contrast with that without current. In addition, the D-0 and Q(D) were determined to reduce from 1.369(-0.324)(+0.424) x 10(-13) to 5.016(-1.984)(+3.284) x 10(-15) m(2)/s, and from 39.7 +/- 1.8 to 21.6 +/- 3.4 kJ/mol respectively with the Mo contents increasing from Mo-0 to Mo-0.2 without pulse current. The introduction of pulse current into the diffusion couples dramatically promoted the D-0 at all the diffusion couples. However, the pulse current was ascertained to obviously increase the Q(D) in contrast to that of diffusion couples without pulse current. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We designed and synthesized two small unsymmetrical phenanthro-imidazole/phenothiazine molecules with (OHM-2) and without (OHM-1) a phenyl-pi-spacer. The optical and electrochemical properties were measured to determine the band-gap and HOMO energy values of these molecules. It was observed that the phenyl-pi-spacer played a crucial-role in lowering the hole-reorganization energy, extending the conjugation for improved electrical properties, and tuning the optical/electrochemical properties for optoelectronic applications. An alkyl-chain introduced on structure increased the hydrophobicity, improving stability in ambient atmosphere applications. Unsymmetrical phenanthro-imidazole/phenothiazine molecules were shown to be a suitable, versatile hole-transporting material for high-performance optoelectronic devices. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB KCa2Ta3 xNbxO10 samples were synthesized by solid-state reaction and evaluated on the hydroxylation of terephthalic acid under UVC irradiation. Computational simulations via DFT were carried out in order to study their structural and electronic properties. Theoretical results show good agreement with experimental data, regarding lattice parameters and band-gap energy values and indicated that the photocatalytic performance for hydroxyl radicals production is directly related to the degree of octahedral distortions in these materials.

AB A new SIMA-imitated brazing was used to join Mn-Cu damping alloy and 430 stainless steel (SS) with Cu-34Mn-6Ni-10Sn filler metal. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the brazed joint were investigated. The results show that the semi-solid brazing seam was obtained at 790 degrees C. A (Fe, Mn, Cr) solid solution diffusion layer was formed between 430SS and brazing seam. The Mn-Fe-Cu-Cr compounds were formed in brazing seam due to the dissolution of 430SS. The liquid phase penetrated along the grain boundaries of Mn-Cu alloy. The shear strength of the brazed joint is 230 MPa, the brazed joint exhibits a ductile fracture feature. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Understanding the behavior of a surface is important for various applications. Non-wettable surfaces inspired from lotus leaf phenomenon was described by Wenzel and Cassie Baxter theories. Hydrophobic surface can be obtained by enhancing surface roughness which is inversely proportional to the surface energy. The determination of Hamaker's constant is necessary for the calculation of surface energy. Here in this work surface roughness and energy of various silane and polymer blend were calculated using Hamaker's constant which implies hydrophobicity. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Constrained high pressure torsion and subsequent annealing was used to fabricate Al-Cu-Al metal-matrix multilayered composite. The composite has a heterogeneous structure consisting of a plastic aluminum matrix and hard intermetallic inclusions with a gradient decrease of layer thickness from the center to periphery of the sample. Intermetallic growth kinetics was retrieved from precise X-ray phase analysis using a narrow parallel X-ray beam of increased intensity. It was found that the growth of Al2Cu phase at temperatures from 150 degrees C to 210 degrees C can be fitted by t(1/2) time relation, indicating to the bulk diffusion-controlled growth kinetics. The growth activation energy of Al2Cu was calculated to be 0.48 eV. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We design and prepare a novel hierarchical carbonaceous electrode material (SBA-C-K-N) for supercapacitor. The combination of micro/mesoporous structure and extra-framework cations endow SBA-C-K-N with outstanding electrochemical performance, including high specific capacitance of 134.4 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) and ideal rate capability. Meanwhile, 97.3% of the specific capacitance is well-maintained after 1000 cycles. Surprisingly, comprehensive characterization showed extra-framework cations (K+) could boost capacitance and decrease charge-transfer resistance, which might result from pre-fixed extra-framework cations decreased interfacial barrier between electrode surface and electrolyte and sped up mass transport between both phases.

AB In order to reduce the contact resistance of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), we designed a simple and new way for doping transition metal Co on CNTs. Bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZnCo-ZIFs) were in situ grown on the carboxylated CNTs first, and then with the volatilization of Zn metal during the pyrolysis at 800 degrees C, Co-CNTs were successfully fabricated. The Raman spectra indicated that Co decoration induced a p-type doping effect, which facilitated to increase the electrical conductivity of Co-CNTs. Co-CNTs were assembled onto gold electrodes by dielectrophoresis, and the contact resistance of Co-CNTs was much lower than that of pristine CNTs (66.67% decrease). This work may provide a new insight into the development of metal-doped CNTs based on metal-organic frameworks precursors for improving the contact resistance of CNTs, as well as the performance and useful life of electronic devices.

AB Recently, as vital factors for corrosion resistance, grain boundary character distribution and random high angle grain boundaries networks gradually gained extensive attention. And grain boundary engineering was widely used in improving intergranular corrosion resistance of face-centered-cubic materials, such as austenitic stainless steel, nickel-based alloy and lead alloy, etc. But the relevant research on high-pure copper was rarely studied. In this work, the intergranular corrosion behavior of high purity copper was investigated by potentiodynamic polarization tests in 0.1 M sodium chloride. And the influence of grain boundary character distribution (GBCD) and random high angle grain boundaries network (RHGBN) connectivity were explored. The contribution of multiple-twinning process to interrupt RHGBN connectivity was analyzed. Results clearly demonstrated that GBE samples all exhibited a high resistance to intergranular corrosion (IGC), particularly, sample with higher fraction of low-Sigma CSL boundaries (GBE-1) or with lower RHGBN connectivity (GBE-3) both had a higher resistance to IGC. Multiple-twinning process during annealing was the key factor to interrupt the connectivity of random high angle boundaries network. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Materials were obtained by casting in different volumetric ratios of PNR/CB. The composite of PNR with a 7% inclusion of CB showed great potential for use as an electromechanical sensor: a linear behavior of the electric resistance with the mechanical deformation in repeated cycles with an appreciable gauge factor.

AB In this work, p-type Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 polycrystalline materials were fabricated by a modified melting method without vacuum protection, and the effects of the air isolation from the capping agents on the microstructure, phase purity, and thermoelectric properties were systematically investigated. Results show that capping agents could effectively prevent elementary materials from oxidation and evaporation. A maximal figure of merit of approximately 1.2 is obtained at 373 K for the sample loaded with 3.2 g of capping agents. With the help of capping agents, the vacuum condition is no longer a necessity for the fabrication of p-type bismuth telluride systems, which would be beneficial for the large-scale processing from the point of view of industrial production.

AB A novel P-N heterojunctions of ZnS nanoparticles (ZnS NPs) coupled with porous Cu3SnS4 were synthesized by microwave irradiation and oil bath heating in two steps. The coupling of different amounts of ZnS NPs was further realized by adjusting the concentration of precursors in the oil bath reaction. Sample with 0.5 mmol precursor showed the best catalytic effect when it was used to degrade methyl blue under simulated natural sunlight. We observed that the optimal degradation rate is 0.434 h (1), which exceeds 2.5 times that of ZnS NPs. The increase in catalytic activity can be attributed to the presence of the P-N junction possessed by ZnS NPs@CTS and its porous morphology. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The emerging classes of perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) (e.g., Perfluorobutanoic add (PFBA), perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), GenX, ADONA, and F-53B) are persistent and recalcitrant to removal by conventional treatment techniques. Herein, we report on poly (N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl] acrylamide, methyl chloride quaternary, DMAPAA-Q) hydrogel matrix as an effective sorbent for sequestering PFAS from different water matrices. The selective removal of 16 PFAS from different classes using DMAPAA-Q polymer was confirmed in surface waters and treated wastewater at environmentally relevant concentration (i.e., <1000 ng/L). The results showed fast removal kinetics with equilibrium time of 60-120 min and a higher removal of sulfonated than carboxylic PFAS, regardless of their chain lengths. These observations were in agreement with adsorption energy calculations of short- and long-chain PFAS on poly DMAPAA-Q hydrogel using density functional theory (DFT). No desorption was observed when the experimental time was extended to 24 h, which gives an added advantage of poly DMAPAA-Q hydrogel over previously reported adsorbents in the literature. In addition, the removal efficiency was not affected under a varying pH range of 4-10. The impact of background anions on PFAS removal by poly DMAPAA-Q hydrogel was tested and found to follow an order of SO42- > Cl- > NO3-. The performance of poly DMAPAA-Qhydrogel was maintained in six consecutive adsorption/regeneration cycles to remove PFAS. The unique fast kinetics and high adsorption activity of poly DMAPAA-Q hydrogel towards PFAS exhibits a great potential for being a promising material for PFAS control. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Chrome mist suppressants are key chemicals used in the chrome plating industry to reduce exposure of workers by inhalation to airborne chromic acid pollution. Perfluoroalkyl sulfonated compounds are excellent mist suppressants, thanks to their chemical stability and surface activity. Therefore, despite mounting evidence for their persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity, it is likely that such chemicals will continue to be used for the foreseeable future because of their importance and lack of alternatives. The present study is aimed at assessing the feasibility of advanced reduction as an effective technology to treat chrome plating industry wastewater. In particular, wastewater containing a chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (i.e. F-53B), an alternative to perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) used to prepare chrome mist suppressant in China, was treated by UV-activated sulfite. Results demonstrates that in ultrapure water F-53B can be easily degraded within 1 min-much faster than PFOS. Stoichiometric fluoride recovery was also achieved, confirming significant defluorination of the pollutant Such superior reducibility was due to the presence of chlorine atoms, as corroborated by quantum chemical calculations. F-53B degradation was also achieved in chrome plating industrial wastewater, which yielded results were slower than those achieved in the laboratory nonetheless obtained complete abatement within 60 min. These results suggest that the proposed advanced reduction process is one of the safest options to control PFAS discharge in the environment and reduce the related risks to ecosystems.

AB TiO2-supported chitosan scaffolds (TiO2/CS) are here proposed as promising material for wastewater treatment, in particular for the removal of pharmaceutical compounds. TiO2/CS are tested for the amoxicillin photodegradation under UV/Vis irradiation. Amoxicillin (AMX) is an antibiotic of the betalactam family. Due to the release of antibiotics in wastewater and their persistence in the environment, harmful effects can develop on the aquatic and terrestrial organisms.
   TiO2 chitosan scaffolds with photocatalytic activity for wastewater remediation have been prepared by 3D printing using commercial P25-TiO2. The formulation for the 3D printer was prepared by dispersion of chitosan and TiO2 in powder form at the concentration 6% w/v and 1% w/v, respectively. The TiO2 particles (crystalline anatase and rutile phases) embedded in the chitosan have a size of about 20 nm, like in the starting material, as verified by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy and are homogeneously distributed in the scaffold, also after repeated photocatalytic tests, as revealed by SEM-EDS.
   The mechanical properties of the 3D structures are suitable for the targeted application as they can be easily handled without breakage.
   The AMX photodegradation efficiency under light irradiation by TiO2/CS made with scaffolds of different thicknesses (3, 5,15 layers), was assessed in water by means of UV-Vis absorption and HPLC/UV measurements, at two different AMX:TiO2 molar ratios: 1/100 and 1/10. The 3D printed TiO2/CS system, even after repeated cycles, shows a high photodegradation efficiency, compared to the direct AMX photolysis.

AB Microplastics (MPs, <5 mm in size) are classified as emerging contaminants but treatment processes are not designed to remove these small particles. Wastewater treatment systems have been proposed as pathways for MPs pollution to receiving waters but quantitative and qualitative data on MP occurrence and transport remains limited, hindering risk assessment and regulation. Here, for the first time, the stepwise abundance and loading of MPs (60-2800 mu m) in a tertiary wastewater treatment plant in the UK was assessed by sampling from May 2017 to February 2018. Microplastics were found in all sampling campaigns, with an average inflow of 8.1 x 10(8) (95% CI, 3.8 x 10(8) to 1.2 x 10(9)) items day(-1). Their prevalence decreased from influent to final effluent. Overall abundances decreased on average by 6%, 68%, 92%, and 96% after the pre-treatment, primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment stages respectively, although considerable variability occurred throughout the year. Sufficient particles remained in the treated effluent to generate an average discharge of 2.2 x 10(7) (95% CI, 1.2 x 10(7) to 3.2 x 10(7)]) particles day(-1) to the recipient river. Secondary MPs were predominant, while primary MP abundances were minimal. Fibres comprised 67% of all items, followed by films (18%) and fragments (15%). Chemical characterisation confirmed the presence of different types of polymers, with polypropylene fibres and fragments most abundant (23%). This research informs understanding of how wastewater effluent may channel MPs to the natural environment and their composition, and helps understand control points for optimising advanced treatment processes.

AB A novel unsteady flow numerical model for the simulation of the transport of non-uniform non-cohesive sediment mixtures (SM) during flushing operation in sewers is presented in this paper. The model was applied to the case of a flush experimental test that was recently carried out in a combined sewer channel of the sewer system of Paris city that exhibits depositional problems due to relatively coarse sediments. The model output was compared to the results of the field experiments as well as to those obtained with a model for the transport of uniform sediments (US). The model for SM provided a reliable interpretation of the selective transport of the sediments deposited in the channel bed as induced by the flush. The comparison showed the model for SM to provide an enhanced description of the erosional effects of the flush on the deposits, including improved evaluation of the volume of sediments flushed out of the experimental channel in the field.

AB Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are classified as persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Concentrations of 209 PCB congeners as well as profiles of the ten homologues were determined in stormwater sediments collected from various (primarily roadway) sites with different land use. The total PCB concentrations ranged from 8.3 to 57.4 ng/g dry weight (dw), with a mean value of 29.2 ng/g dw. PCB concentrations varied with nearby land use. Higher stormwater sediment PCB concentrations were found in dense urban areas (average: 39.8 +/- 10.5 ng/g) and residential areas (average: 35.3 +/- 6.2 ng/g) compared to highways passing through greenspace (average: 18.0 +/- 0.4 ng/g). The number of chlorines per biphenyl ranged from 3.63 to 5.39 and the toxic equivalency (TEQs) of the PCBs were between 1.5 and 18.0 pg/g at all sites. A non-Aroclor congener, PCB 11, was detected in all samples and was dominant at two sites. PCBs were sorbed to smaller stormwater particulate matter (<= 75 mu m) at higher concentrations compared to larger particles (>75 mu m). PCB sorption tended to increase with the total organic carbon (TOC) of the particulate matter in the sediment samples. However, greater PCB mass (almost 80%) was present in the larger particles. Information on sediment PCB concentrations from different land uses, along with stormwater particulate matter data can allow the estimation of PCB loads and load reductions using stormwater control measures.

AB The effects of three commonly bioavailable nitrogen (N) sources (nitrate, ammonium, and urea) on regulating the growth and microcystins (MCs) production of Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) at environmentally relevant concentrations were investigated from a physiological perspective. Changes in amino acid quotas as well as the transcripts of target genes associated with N metabolism (ntcA, pipX and glnB) and toxin formation (mcyA and mcyD) were determined. Results indicated that increases in nitrate and urea concentrations enhanced M. aeruginosa growth, but high ammonium concentration (7 mg-N/L) suppressed the growth. The total intracellular MCs (IMCs) content was well correlated (0.65, p < 0.001) to amino acids (the sum of methionine, leucine, serine, alanine, arginine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid) associated with MCs production. Ammonium favors amino acid synthesis in M. aeruginosa, thus cells grown under high concentrations of ammonium (7 mg-N/L) had sufficient precursors for MCs production, which might lead to higher IMCs. Both high and low ammonium concentration resulted in high total extracellular MCs (EMCs) level in water, despite of their different mechanisms. These results indicated that mitigation of nitrogen in eutrophic waters should be very cautious of unexpected risks, as the reduction of ammonium may have the risk of stimulating M. aeruginosa growth or increasing EMCs levels.

AB In this article a new characterization model and factors are proposed for the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) of water consumption on instream freshwater ecosystems. Impact pathways of freshwater consumption leading to ecosystem damage are described and the alteration of instream physical habitat is identified as a critical midpoint for ecosystem quality. The LCIA characterization model aims to assess the change in habitat quantity due to consumptive water use. It is based on statistical, physical habitat simulation for benthic invertebrates, fish species and their size classes, and guilds of fish sharing common habitat preferences. A habitat change potential (HCP) midpoint, mechanistic indicator, is developed and computed on the French river network at the river reach scale (the river segment with variable length between the upstream and downstream nodes in the hydrographic network), for median annual discharges and dry seasons. Aggregated, multi-species HCPs at a river reach are proposed using various aggregation approaches. Subsequently, the characterization factors are spatially aggregated at watershed and sub-watershed scales. HCP is highly correlated with median and low flow discharges, which determine hydraulic characteristics of reaches. Aggregation of individual HCPs at reach scale is driven by the species most sensitive to water consumption. In spatially aggregated HCPs, consistently with their reduced smaller average discharge rate, small stream habitats determine the overall watershed characterization. The study is aimed primarily at life cycle assessment (LCA) practitioners and LCIA modelers. However, since it is the result of a productive cross-fertilization between the ecohydrology and LCA domains, it could be potentially useful for watershed management and risk assessment as well. At the moment, the proposed model is applicable in France. For a broader implementation, the development of global, high resolution river databases or the generalization of the model are needed. Our new factor represents nevertheless an advancement in freshwater ecosystems LCIA laying the basis for new metrics for biodiversity assessment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the feasibility of a new biological nitrogen removal process that integrates sulfur-driven autotrophic denitratation (NO3- -> NO2-) and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (Anammox) for simultaneous removal of nitrate and ammonium from industrial wastewater. The proposed sulfur(thiosulfate)-driven denitratation and Anammox process was developed in two phases: First, the thiosulfate-driven denitratation was established in the UASB inoculated with activated sludge and fed with ammonium, nitrate and thiosulfate for 52 days until the nitrite level in the effluent reached 32.1 mg N/L. Second, enriched Anammox biomass was introduced to the UASB to develop the integrated thiosulfate-driven denitratation and Anammox (TDDA) bioprocess (53-212 d). Results showed that nitrate and ammonium could be efficiently removed from synthetic wastewater by the integrated TDDA system at a total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency of 82.5 +/- 1.8% with an influent NH4+-N of 101.2 +/- 2.2 mgN/L, NO3--N of 101.1 +/- 1.5 mgN/L and thiosulfate of 202.5 +/- 3.2 mg S/L. It was estimated that Anammox and autotrophic denitritation (NO2--> N-2) contributed to about 90% and 10% of the TN removal respectively at stable operation. The established TDDA system was further supported by high-throughput sequencing analysis that sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (e.g., Thiobacillus and Sulfurimonas) coexisted with Anammox bacteria (e.g., Ca. Kuenenia and Ca. Anammoxoglobus) in this syntrophic biocenosis. Additionally, batch experiments were conducted to reveal the kinetic rates and to reconcile the stoichiometry of the electron donor/acceptor couples of the TDDA process. The results unraveled the mechanisms in the new bioprocess: i) sulfite and elemental sulfur (S-0) were initially generated from branched thiosulfate; ii) oxidation of sulfite and elemental sulfur coupled with fast and slow denitratation; iii) nitrite produced from denitratation together with ammonium were effectively converted to dinitrogen gas via Anammox.

AB Organic matter (OM) refers to the largest reactive reservoir of carbon-based compounds on Earth. Aside of its role as a source of carbon, OM is also actively involved in a wide range of ecological functions. It also plays an important role in the solubility, toxicity, bioavailability, mobility and distribution of pollutants. Therefore, OM is a key component in the local and global carbon cycle. About 12,000 articles containing organic matter in the title were published during the past decade, with a continuous increasing number each year (ISI Web of Science). Although this topic was widely explored and its interest has significantly increased, some limitations remain. These limitations can be technical (e.g., pre-treatment processes, low-resolution instrument, data handling) and can be related to the current approach. In this review, we first present the current strategies and tools to characterize the organic matter in the aquatic environment, then we tackle several aspects of current characterization limitations. Finally, we suggest new perspectives and priorities of research to improve the current limitations. From our point of view, simultaneous studies of particulate and dissolved OM fractions should be prioritized and multidisciplinary approach, creation of databases, controlled experiments and collaborative works should be the next targets for future OM research priorities.

AB Evaluating the causes and consequences of dominance by a limited number of taxa in phytoplankton communities is of huge importance in the current context of increasing anthropogenic pressures on natural ecosystems. This is of particular concern in densely populated urban areas where usages and impacts of human populations on water ecosystems are strongly interconnected. Microbial biodiversity is commonly used as a bioindicator of environmental quality and ecosystem functioning, but there are few studies at the regional scale that integrate the drivers of dominance in phytoplankton communities and their consequences on the structure and functioning of these communities. Here, we studied the causes and consequences of phytoplankton dominance in 50 environmentally contrasted waterbodies, sampled over four summer campaigns in the highly-populated Ile-de-France region (IDF). Phytoplankton dominance was observed in 32-52% of the communities and most cases were attributed to Chlorophyta (35.5-40.6% of cases) and Cyanobacteria (30.3-36.5%). The best predictors of dominance were identified using multinomial logistic regression and included waterbody features (surface, depth and connection to the hydrological network) and water column characteristics (total N, TN:TP ratio, water temperature and stratification). The consequences of dominance were dependent on the identity of the dominant organisms and included modifications of biological attributes (richness, cohesion) and functioning (biomass, RUE) of phytoplankton communities. We constructed co-occurrence networks using high resolution phytoplankton biomass and demonstrated that networks under dominance by Chlorophyta and Cyanobacteria exhibited significantly different structure compared with networks without dominance. Furthermore, dominance by Cyanobacteria was associated with more profound network modifications (e.g. cohesion, size, density, efficiency and proportion of negative links), suggesting a stronger disruption of the structure and functioning of phytoplankton communities in the conditions in which this group dominates. Finally, we provide a synthesis on the relationships between environmental drivers, dominance status, community attributes and network structure. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Groundwater is not only a vital resource, but also one of the largest terrestrial aquatic ecosystems on Earth. However, to date, ecological criteria are often not considered in routine groundwater monitoring, mainly because of the lack of suitable ecological assessment tools. Prokaryotic microorganisms are ubiquitous in groundwater ecosystems even under the harshest conditions, making them ideal bioindicators for ecological monitoring. We have developed a simple, inexpensive approach that enables ecological groundwater monitoring based on three microbiological parameters that can be easily integrated into existing routine monitoring practices: prokaryotic cell density (D) measured by flow cytometry; activity (A) measured as prokaryotic intracellular ATP concentrations using a simple celllysis-luminescence assay; and, as an optional parameter, the bioavailable carbon (C) measured as the concentration of assimilable organic carbon in a simple batch growth assay. We analyzed data for three case studies of different disturbances representing some of the main threats to groundwater ecosystems, i.e. organic contamination with hydrocarbons, surface water intrusion, and agricultural land use. For all three disturbances, disturbed samples could be reliably distinguished from undisturbed samples based on a single index value obtained from multivariate outlier analyses of the microbial variables. We could show that this multivariate approach allowed for a significantly more sensitive and reliable detection of disturbed samples compared to separate univariate outlier analyses of the measured variables. Furthermore, a comparison of non-contaminated aquifers from nine different regions across Germany revealed distinct multivariate signatures along the three microbial variables, which should be considered when applying our approach in practice. In essence, our approach offers a practical tool for the detection of disturbances of groundwater ecosystems based on microbial parameters which can be seamlessly extended in the future by additional parameters for higher sensitivity as well as flexibility.

AB Environmental and measure implementation costs are two key factors to be considered by river managers in decision making. To balance effects and costs of an action, practitioners can rely on diagnostic analysis of presence/absence freshwater species distribution models (SDMs) trained to over- or underestimating species presence. Prevalence-adjusted model training aims to balance under- and overestimation depending on study objectives and training data characteristics. The objective of minimising under- and overestimation is a typical example of multi-objective optimisation (MOO). The aim of this paper is to address, for the first time, the practice of MOO-based prevalence-adjusted SDM training for freshwater decision management In a numerical experiment, the use of Pareto-based MOO, specifically the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), is compared to commonly-used single-objective optimisation. SDMs for 11 pollution-sensitive freshwater macroinvertebrate species are trained with a subset of the Limnodata, a large data set holding records in the Netherlands over 30 years at 20,000 locations. An increase of two to four times is observed for the ability to identify a large range distribution of the solutions in the Pareto space, when using NSGA-II counter to repeated single-objective optimisation, this by increasing the average runtime with only four percent for a single run. In addition, the use of NSGA-II is found to be effective to identify reliable SDMs useful for diagnostic analysis. By applying and comparing a broad range of MOO methodologies for prevalence-adjusted model training, we believe a closer collaboration between model developers and freshwater managers can be facilitated and environmental standard limits can be set on a more objective basis. In conclusion, the use of MOO for prevalence-adjusted model training is assessed as a valuable tool to support river - and potentially all environmental - decision making. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Physical floc properties were systematically investigated by analysing the structure of algal and cyanobacterial flocs produced by five species (green algae (Chlorella vulgaris) and cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa (strain CS-564), Microcystis aeruginosa (strain CS-555/01), Dolichospermum circinale and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii) using aluminium sulphate (alum) at different doses and pH values. The properties of spherical, compact flocs were determined using a laser diffraction instrument and a new in situ image analysis technique was validated to analyse the structure of more complex flocs. The incorporation of algal-derived organic matter (AOM) into the flocs was inferred by evaluating the dissolved organic matter concentration character before and after flocculation using liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection (LC-OCD). D. circinale, C. raciborskii, and M. aeruginosa (CS-564) produced large flocs (2-9 mm), while M. aeruginosa (CS-555) and C vulgaris produced smaller flocs (<2 mm). While differences in physical floc properties were observed to result from changes in coagulation mechanism, the cell morphology and the AOM composition were the most influential factors. Examination of floc properties can give a rapid insight at the plant for trouble shooting, particularly through the use of the in situ techniques and provide a mechanism by which floc properties can be tailored to downstream processes.

AB Nitrate pollution in groundwater has become a widespread problem worldwide, but understanding of the factors influencing groundwater nitrate pollution remains limited. Numerous studies have attributed nitrate pollution mostly to surface conditions and have neglected the role of hydrogeology. Therefore, this study used the Shaying River Basin as the study area and developed a least squares surface fitting (LSSF) model to systematically analyze the effect of hydrogeological conditions and surface pollution loads on groundwater nitrate pollution. Intrinsic vulnerability and total soil nitrogen (TSN) were used to represent hydrogeological conditions and surface pollution loads, respectively. The results showed that the concentrations of NO3-N in shallow groundwater ranged from 0.002 to 256.29 mg/L (with an average of 14.38 mg/L). The concentration had an overall decreasing trend along the flow path. The water chemistry tended to change from HCO3-Ca to HCO3 center dot CI-Ca as the NO3-N concentration increased. Groundwater nitrate pollution was simultaneously controlled by intrinsic vulnerability and TSN, and the LSSF model explained 83.5% of the result within a 95% confidence interval. These findings explained the phenomenon by which some areas had high surface loads but no serious groundwater nitrate pollution and some areas had nitrate pollution but no high surface loads. Nitrate accumulated in high levels in areas with a high intrinsic vulnerability due to hydrogeological conditions. TSN, which was the main source of NO3-N in groundwater, came mainly from agricultural nitrogen fertilizer inputs and livestock manure. These findings provide helpful information for those tasked with managing and controlling groundwater quality. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Emerging water treatment technologies using ferrous and zero-valent iron show promising virus mitigation by both inactivation and adsorption. In this study, iron electrocoagulation was investigated for virus mitigation in drinking water via bench-scale batch experiments. Relative contributions of physical removal and inactivation, as determined by recovery via pH 9.5 beef broth elution, were investigated for three mammalian viruses (adenovirus, echovirus, and feline calicivirus) and four bacteriophage surrogates (fr, MS2, P22, and (Phi X174). Though no one bacteriophage exactly represented mitigation of the mammalian viruses in all water matrices, bacteriophage Phi X174 was the only surrogate that showed overall removal comparable to that of the mammalian viruses. Bacteriophages fr, MS2, and P22 were all more susceptible to inactivation than the three mammalian viruses, raising concerns about the suitability of these common surrogates as indicators of virus mitigation. To determine why some bacteriophages were particularly susceptible to inactivation, mechanisms of bacteriophage mitigation due to electrocoagulation were investigated. Physical removal was primarily due to inclusion in flocs, while inactivation was primarily due to ferrous iron oxidation. Greater electrostatic attraction, virus aggregation, and capsid durability were proposed as reasons for virus susceptibility to ferrous-based inactivation. Results suggest that overall treatment claims based on bacteriophage mitigation for any iron-based technology should be critically considered due to higher susceptibility of bacteriophages to inactivation via ferrous oxidation.

AB Many chemicals with different physico-chemical properties are present in municipal wastewater. In this study, the removal of a broad range of trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) was determined in two biological treatment processes differing in hydraulic retention time: sequential biofiltration (SBF) and soil-aquifer treatment (SAT), operated in Germany and Spain. Occurrence and the degree of removal of more than 150 TOrCs with different physico-chemical properties were analysed, including precursors as well as human metabolites and environmental transformation products (TPs). Ninety TOrCs were detected in the feed water of the SBF system, 40% of these showed removal efficiencies of higher than 30% during biological treatment. In SAT, 70 TOrCs were detected in the feed water, 60% of these could be reduced by more than 30% after approximately 3 days of subsurface treatment. For uncharged and negatively charged TOrCs biological degradation was mainly responsible for the removal, while positively charged TOrCs were most likely also removed by ionic interactions. The detections of TPs confirmed that biodegradation was a major removal process in both systems. The analysis of positively and negatively charged, neutral and zwitterionic TOrCs and the simultaneous analysis of precursors and their biologically formed TPs enabled a detailed understanding of underlying mechanisms of their removal in the two systems. On this basis, criteria for site-specific indicator selection were proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI An empirical determination of the whole-life cost of FO-based open-loop

AB Over the past 5-10 years it has become apparent that the significant energy benefit provided by forward osmosis (FO) for desalination arises only when direct recovery of the permeate product from the solution used to transfer the water through the membrane (the draw solution) is obviated. These circumstances occur specifically when wastewater purification is combined with saline water desalination. It has been suggested that, for such an "open loop" system, the FO technology offers a lower-cost water reclamation option than the conventional process based on reverse osmosis (RO).
   An analysis is presented of the costs incurred by this combined treatment objective. Three process schemes are considered combining the FO or RO technologies with membrane bioreactors (MBRs): MBR-RO, MBR-FO-RO and osmotic MBR (OMBR)-RO. Calculation of the normalised net present value (NPV/permeate flow) proceeded through developing a series of empirical equations based on available individual capital and operating cost data. Cost curves (cost vs. flow capacity) were generated for each option using literature MBR and RO data, making appropriate assumptions regarding the design and operation of the novel FO and OMBR technologies.
   Calculations revealed the MBR-FO-RO and OMBR-RO schemes to respectively offer a similar to 20% and similar to 30% NPV benefit over the classical MBR-RO scheme at a permeate flow of 10,000 m(3) d(-1), provided the respective schemes are applied to high and low salinity wastewaters. Outcomes are highly sensitive to the FO or OMBR flux sustained: the relative NPV benefit (compared to the classical system) of the OMBR-RO scheme declined from 30% to similar to 4% on halving the OMBR flux from a value of 6 L m(-2). h(-1).
