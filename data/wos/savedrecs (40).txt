AB A series of carbon catalysts are synthesized through the arylation diazonium salt reduction approach from coal to catalyze esterification of oleic acid with methanol for biodiesel production. Under the activated carbon preparation temperature of 900 degrees C, mass ratio of 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid to activated carbon of 6 and arylation temperature of 45 degrees C, the synthesized carbon catalyst gains the surface area and pore volume of 629.3 m(2) g(-1) and 0.29 cm(-3) g(-1), respectively. Besides, the carbon catalyst possesses abundant and strong active sites with the 4-sulfophenyl group density of 0.97 mmol g(-1) and acid strength of 0.8 < pH < 3.3. Catalytic capability of the carbon catalyst, which is synthesized under the above optimized condition, in esterification is stronger than the commercial Amberlyst-15, where the maximum efficiency achieves 95.04% with the carbon catalyst added mass percentage of 12%, molar ratio of methanol to oleic acid of 10, esterification duration of 4 h and esterification temperature of 65 degrees C. Due to leaching of the 4-sulfophenyl groups, esterification efficiency declines to 77.63% for the fifth reused cycle of the carbon catalyst. Meanwhile, the regenerated carbon catalyst supplies the esterification efficiency of 86.05%. Chemical composition of the produced biodiesel is identical to pure methyl oleate and its fuel properties are in accordance with ASTM D 6751.

AB Fair and reasonable cost allocation among the consumers of different energy services of a multiproduct system can contribute positively to wider acceptance of energy efficiency strategies and reduction of pollutant emissions. Cost allocation can be carried out by the application of thermoeconomic methodologies, which can unravel the cost formation process in complex energy systems. This work applies the UFS (Internal Energy - Flow Work - Entropy) thermoeconomic methodology to allocate costs and environmental impacts in a heat pump utilized for food dehydration and water production. The UFS method evaluates the main components of the heat pump individually, including the expansion valve. Exergy analysis is carried out to identify the components with highest exergy destruction. Economic analysis is carried out for monetary cost evaluation and Life Cycle Assessment calculated the carbon emissions associated with the products of the heat pump. Results revealed that the evaporator and condenser devices are responsible for more than half of the overall exergy destroyed and the overall system presented 1.07% exergy efficiency. The UFS method revealed that the cost of the system (US$ 698.2/month) and carbon emissions (151.5 kg CO2 .eq/month) should be allocated to the food dehydration and water production processes in a proportion of 51% and 49%, respectively.

AB Introduction: Long-acting muscarinic antagonist/long-acting beta agonist (LAMA/LABA) combination products have recently been introduced. We sought to describe the impact of these products on patterns of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) therapy.
   Materials and methods: We used administrative healthcare data from Ontario, Canada, to identify all residents aged >= 65 years who were dispensed a product to treat COPD at least once between January 2010 and May 2016, and to calculate the monthly prevalence of use of 11 mutually exclusive therapeutic regimens. We also compared the characteristics of new users of LAMA/LABA and LAMA + LABA regimens.
   Results: Overall use of any COPD regimen remained stable in the year following the formulary listing of LAMA/ LABA combination products in May 2015, as did the use of LABA/ICS (most commonly-used regimen). Use of LAMA/LABA and LAMA/LABA + ICS (inhaled corticosteroid) regimens rose rapidly to 283 and 56 users per 100,000 population, respectively, while concurrent falls were seen for LAMA + LABA/ICS (2047 to 1944), LAMA + LABA + ICS (30-19), and LAMA + LABA (103-63). LAMA and LABA monotherapy use declined (1764 to 1669 and 57 to 51, respectively). New users of LAMA/LABA were more likely to be male, urban-dwelling, and to have transitioned from LABA/ICS therapy than new users of LAMA + LABA, and less likely to have transitioned from LAMA or LABA monotherapy, or LAMA + ICS. They were also more likely to have visited a respirologist, and less likely to have been hospitalised, at least once in the preceding 180 days.
   Conclusions: The introduction of LAMA/LABA combination products led to population-level changes in regimens used for COPD therapy, but no overall increase in long-acting therapy use. New users of LAMA/LABA and LAMA + LABA regimens transitioned to dual LAMA and LABA therapy through different treatment pathways.

AB Back ground: Chronic airflow obstruction (CAO) is the primary characteristic of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but is also seen in chronic asthma.
   Objective: To compare the prevalence of CAO and possible risk factors between Tartu in Estonia, Reykjavik in Iceland and Uppsala in Sweden.
   Methods: All participants underwent spirometry testing of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) before and after bronchodilation. CAO was defined as post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC below lower limit of normal. Information on respiratory diseases and smoking status, was obtained through questionnaires administered by trained interviewers.
   Results: 1037 men and 956 women participated in the study. The prevalence of CAO was lower in women in Tartu compared to the other centres (4.9% vs. 13.4 and 8.7% in Reykjavik and Uppsala, respectively, p = 0.002) while no difference was found for men. A similar picture was seen for the proportion of participants that had smoked 10 pack years or more which was much lower in Tartu for women than in Reykjavik and Uppsala, respectively (13.2% vs. 33.7 and 29.2%, p < 0.001). (Fig. 1). Of the participants with CAO the majority (57-67%) did not have a previous diagnosis of asthma or COPD.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of CAO was lower in Estonian women than in women from Iceland and Sweden. The reason for this was probably that the Estonian women had smoked less than the female participants from Iceland and Sweden. The majority of those with CAO do not have a diagnosed lung disease.

AB Introduction: A high prevalence of OSA has been observed in asthma populations, with detrimental impact on clinical outcomes.
   Aim: To determine if CPAP treatment of co-existing OSA improves asthma-related symptoms and quality of life.
   Methods: Literature review of EMBASE and MEDLINE databases prior to July 2017. Study populations included asthmatics with co-existing OSA treated with CPAP, and >= 1 asthma-related clinical outcome measure.
   Results: 12 studies; 8 prospective quasi-experimental and 4 observational. Mean CPAP duration; 19.5 (2-100) weeks. Meta-analysis demonstrated significant improvement in mean Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire scores (AQLQ and mini-AQLQ); 0.59 (95%CI; 0.25, 0.92), p = 0.0006. No significant improvement was demonstrated in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)% predicted; 0.32 (95% CI; -2.84, 3.47), p = 0.84. Asthma Control Test/Asthma Control Questionnaire improved in 2 studies, with no improvement in 1 study. 4 studies demonstrated improvement in asthma daytime/night-time symptoms, and 3 studies showed improved asthma severity.
   Conclusion: Asthmatics with co-existing OSA can experience improved quality of life with CPAP treatment. This effect appears more pronounced in severe OSA or poorly controlled asthma.

AB Background: biomarkers of Type 2 (T2) inflammation may predict asthma control and exacerbation risk. However, the relationships between individual T2 biomarkers to exacerbations and lung function in severe asthma remain uncertain.
   Objectives: to explore the roles played by T2 biomarkers individually and as a composite score in predicting clinical outcomes in severe asthma.
   Methods: unselected severe asthma patients were enrolled in this cross sectional real life study. Participants were clinically characterised and the following measurements were obtained: the frequency of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (OCS), asthma control (Juniper ACQ6-7), lung function, Fraction exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO), peripheral blood eosinophils (PBE), and serum periostin.
   Results: A total of 115 patients were recruited [mean age 45 years (range 18-70), 80 (69.6%) females, mean forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV1) %predicted was 68% +/- 24.7, mean inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) 1.96 +/- 0.82 mg/day. FeNO correlated significantly with PBE (r = 0.35, p = 0.0004), but not with periostin (r = 0.22, p = 0.065) and there was no significant correlation between PBE and periostin. FeNO correlation with exacerbations (r = 0.42, p = 0.0008) was stronger than PBE and periostin. A composite score of the 3 biomarkers correlated with exacerbations in a dose-dependent manner but multiple regression analysis did not confirm an added benefit. Only periostin demonstrated a significant correlation with FEV1 %predicted (r = -0.34, p = 0.004) with ROC-AUC 0.7.
   Conclusion: FeNO demonstrated stronger correlation with asthma exacerbations than PBE or periostin with no definite added benefit from a composite score of the 3 biomarkers. Only periostin showed significant association with reduced lung function raising its potential as a biomarker of airway remodeling.

AB Background: Aspirin desensitization (AD) has been the only available modifying treatment in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). The mechanisms of AD are nonetheless poorly understood. Though very effective, AD is limited by its risks and side-effects.
   Objective: Moving forward to the targeted biologicals era, the aim of this study was to characterize the airway inflammatory response to long-term AD, including TSLP dynamics, in order to assess potential new targets in AERD.
   Patients and methods: Adult patients with aspirin challenge-confirmed AERD underwent an oral AD followed by daily ingestion of aspirin for at least 6 months. Clinical data and inflammatory biomarkers were measured and compared, before and after AD. Induced sputum analyses were performed at baseline, one and six months after AD (differential cell count and levels of sputum supernatant leukotriene C-4, prostaglandin D2 and E2, and TSLP).
   Results: AD was followed by significant clinical improvement, as quantified by all monitored parameters. The good clinical outcomes of AD in our study are supported by overall changes observed in the arachidonic acid metabolites (decreased PGD2 over a constant LTC4/PGE2). TSLP increased (mean baseline 0.1 +/- 0.03; 1 month 3.68 +/- 7; 6 months 212.2 +/- 44 pg/ml; p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that new biologicals blocking TSLP might have a clinical benefit in AERD, by cutting down the TSLP-induced PGD2 generation.

   ASTHMA; DISEASE; MODEL
AB Background: In children with gastroesophageal reflux (GER) both acid refluxes (AR) and weakly acidic refluxes (WAR) can induce respiratory symptoms (RS).
   Methods: To characterize the airway inflammation in children with more prevalent WAR or AR (defined according a ROC curve analysis), we performed a 3 year-retrospective review of the medical records of patients who underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy for difficult-to-treat chronic/recurrent respiratory symptoms and who had a positive multiple intraluminal esophageal impedance (pH/MII) monitoring.
   Results: In the 13 WAR and 11 AR children, the number of cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was similar [0.78 (0.29-1.28) x 10(6) cells, and 1.05 (0.68-1.64) x 10(6) cells, respectively] (P = 0.22). A neutrophilic alveolitis and an elevated lipid-laden-macrophage (LLM) index were detected in both groups: no differences were found in neutrophils and lymphocyte percentages or in LLM index between WAR and AR children. In contrast, higher BAL epithelial cell proportions were seen in WAR [10.4 (4.85-23.45) %], as compared to AR [2.5 (1.25-7.25) %] children (P = 0.0045), suggesting greater airway damage in the formers. In the whole patient population a significant correlation was found between the proportions of BAL epithelial cells and the number of WAR events (r = 0.43; P = 0.037). Finally, elevated BAL concentrations of substance P and of pepsin were observed, not statistically different in the WAR and AR groups.
   Conclusions: In this patient population, WAR events can be associated with a significant airway inflammation and injury that, because of the biochemical mechanisms involved, are likely not completely preventable and/or counteracted by anti-acid treatments.

AB Objective: To examine the association of genotype with smoking and other key health behaviors among individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) associated lung disease.
   Methods: Self-reported data were analyzed from 3506 individuals with AATD-associated lung disease. All data were collected upon enrollment in a disease management program designed for individuals who have been prescribed augmentation therapy. Multivariate logistic regression was utilized to examine the extent to which genotype was associated with smoking and other key health behaviors (i.e., getting a pneumonia vaccine, getting a flu vaccine, exercising, and maintaining a healthy weight). We hypothesized that MZs and SZs are more likely than ZZs to be current smokers, and that genotype is associated with additional health behaviors.
   Results: MZs and SZs had higher odds of being a current smoker than ZZs (MZ versus ZZ OR = 2.73, p < .001; SZ versus ZZ OR = 4.34, p < .001). For every additional health behavior examined, MZs had higher odds of unhealthy behavior than ZZs (ORs ranged from 1.35 to 1.98, p < .05). SZs had higher odds of unhealthy behavior than ZZs with regard to lack of exercise (OR = 1.52, p = .003) and failure to maintain a healthy weight (underweight OR = 1.93, p = .028; overweight OR = 1.43, p = .015).
   Conclusions: Among individuals who have been prescribed augmentation therapy for lung disease due to AATD, genotype is associated with smoking and additional health behaviors that are central to managing lung disease.

ID RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS; PARAINFLUENZA VIRUSES; YOUNG-CHILDREN;
   HOSPITALIZATIONS; INFLUENZA; BRONCHIOLITIS; TRENDS; DISPARITIES; ILLNESS
AB Background: To assess whether differences exist in the epidemiology and the treatment of croup with respect to gender, race, income and geographical location.
   Methods: Retrospective weighted analysis of patients under 19 admitted with a diagnosis of croup with a subcohort of patients requiring intubation or diagnostic bronchoscopy from the National Inpatient Sample and Kids' Inpatient Database from 2003 to 2013. ICD-9 codes and demographics were analyzed; cross tabulations and linear regression modeling were performed.
   Results: Between 2003 and 2013, 202,188 pediatric patients were admitted with a diagnosis of croup, equivalent to 1-per-100 pediatric admissions. Males were more likely to be admitted for croup than females [OR 2.13 (2.08-2.17)]. Incidence of croup is highest in Caucasians and lowest in Asian and African-American patients. African-American children are more likely to undergo diagnostic bronchoscopy or require intubation [OR 1.23 (1.08-1.401)] than other races. A higher rate of subglottic stenosis was seen in African-American children who required bronchoscopy than expected (39.1% vs 26.7%). After controlling for subglottic stenosis, African-American patients were no longer more likely to undergo diagnostic bronchoscopy or require intubation than other races [OR 1.129 (0.959-1.33)].
   Conclusion: African-American children admitted with a diagnosis of croup appear to have an increased rate of intubation or bronchoscopy. This may be related to the high incidence of subglottic stenosis in this population. After controlling for subglottic stenosis, no difference in intervention rates was seen.

AB Background: An extensive clinical trial program supports the efficacy and safety of tiotropium/olodaterol in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We examined the safety of tiotropium/olodaterol compared with tiotropium in a large population of patients, focusing on cardiovascular and respiratory events.
   Methods: Patients (n = 9942) who received once-daily tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 mu g or tiotropium 5 mu g (via Respimae) in TONADO 1 & 2 and DYNAGITO were included. The number of patients and exposure-adjusted rate of events are presented for adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), AEs leading to discontinuation, and cardiovascular and respiratory events.
   Findings: Fewer patients discontinued due to AEs with tiotropium/olodaterol (5.9%) versus tiotropium (7.9%; rate ratio [RR] 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62-0.84). There was no significant difference in the incidence of AEs, SAEs, cardiovascular AEs or central nervous system vascular AEs between treatments. Incidences of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were 2.11 per 100 patient-years with tiotropium/olodaterol and 2.22 with tiotropium (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.72-1.25), and incidences of fatal MACE (including death with undetermined cause) were 0.91 and 1.00 per 100 patient-years with tiotropium/olodaterol and tiotropium, respectively (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.60-1.37). Respiratory AEs were generally balanced between treatment groups.
   Conclusions: These results provide robust evidence that the benefits of tiotropium/olodaterol versus tiotropium are not at the expense of an increased risk of safety events. The combination is a suitable option for patients with COPD, even in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors.

AB Objectives: To summarize the evidence of small airways involvement in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathophysiology, and to evaluate the efficacy of extrafine formulations of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in combination with long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) in the treatment of COPD.
   Data source: A search of the PubMed database was conducted using the keywords "COPD", "small airways", "inflammation" and "extrafine formulation." The search was limited to entries published in English before August 2016. Only studies conducted in humans were considered.
   Study selection: Publications were included on the basis of relevance.
   Results: COPD is a common preventable and treatable disease, characterized by persistent and progressive airflow limitation. With improved understanding of COPD pathophysiology, small airways (internal diameter < 2 mm), a well-known major site of COPD-associated inflammation and remodeling, have emerged as a potential target for COPD pharmacologic therapies. The ability of extrafine formulations of ICS in combination with LABAs to achieve central and peripheral lung deposition, and the implications of the enhanced efficacy that this may bring, are discussed by examining findings from the development trials plan of the extrafine formulation of beclometasone dipropionate/formoterol fumarate (Foster (R), Chiesi Farmaceutici, Italy) in patients with COPD.
   Conclusion: There is an urgent need for improved and reliable techniques for small airways assessment in order to detect early damage, disease progression and response to treatment. Evidence from randomized clinical trials supports the benefits of extrafine ICS/LABA formulations in COPD, real world studies are necessary to confirm this.

   SALMETEROL; COMBINATION; THERAPY; EXACERBATIONS; FORMOTEROL; OUTCOMES
AB Additional management options, and better use of current options, are needed to help support a large proportion of patients with asthma whose symptoms remain uncontrolled on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Here, we aim to review the safety and efficacy of adding tiotropium to ICS compared with adding a long-acting beta(2)-agonist (LABA) for adults whose asthma is not well controlled on ICS alone. Adding tiotropium to a background of ICS provides beneficial effects that are comparable with addition of a LABA in terms of lung function measures, exacerbations, asthma control and other endpoints. In addition, tiotropium and LABAs are both well tolerated. Some patients respond to either tiotropium or LABA treatment, but not both, suggesting that there are groups of patients that may respond better to one of these drugs. Currently, tiotropium is recommended as an add-on therapy in patients with severe asthma (Global Initiative for Asthma Steps 4 and 5) whose asthma is uncontrolled despite treatment with ICS/LABA. Tiotropium is also effective in patients with less severe disease and may benefit patients who experience adverse events from LABA treatment or where LABAs are ineffective. Tiotropium is therefore an important therapeutic option in asthma, not only as recommended as an add-on treatment with ICS/LABA, but also as an alternative to the addition of LABA to maintenance therapy with an ICS.

AB Background: Proper inhaler technique is essential to maximize the benefit of medications and improve asthma outcomes.
   Objective: To evaluate newly developed pictogram-incorporated medals and their utility on improving the inhaler techniques in asthmatic patients.
   Methods: A prospective, an open label, randomized controlled clinical study was conducted in Jordan from November 2016 to November 2017. The recruited patients were randomly allocated into two groups; control and intervention. Both groups were verbally counselled about proper use of their inhaler devices, however, pictogram medals were attached to the inhalers of patients in the intervention group only. Both groups were ma at baseline and followed-up after 3 months to evaluate their inhaler techniques using standard checklists.
   Results: Of the 219 patients that were recruited and randomized in our study, 49.8% (n = 109) were allocated in the intervention group and 50.2% (n = 110) were in the control group. Both groups had comparable baseline demographics and clinical data (P > 0.05). Significant differences in the improvement of metered dose inhaler (MDI; p < 0.001) and Turbohaler (p = 0.005) techniques were observed between the two groups at the end of study. Patients who used MDI (OR = 7.06, 95% CI = 3.21-15.56, p < 0.001) and Turbohaler (OR = 5.08, 95% CI = 1.57-16.43, p = 0.007) in the intervention group were 7 and 5 times more likely to have improved inhaler techniques as compared to those in the control group respectively.
   Conclusions: Educational pharmaceutical pictograms represent an inexpensive and feasible intervention that can positively affect the proper use of inhalers in asthmatic patients.

AB Objectives: We aimed to investigate the usefulness of routine chest radiograph (CXR) examinations for patients with inflammatory arthritis treated with a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor in terms of (i) the role of CXR in baseline latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) screening and (ii) detecting asymptomatic active tuberculosis after TNF inhibitor initiation.
   Methods: From January 2011 to June 2017, 469 patients with inflammatory arthritis were enrolled in the study at a tertiary referral center in South Korea. At our institution, CXR was performed for all patients undergoing a tuberculin skin test (TST) and/or an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) at the LTBI screening visit. LTBI treatment was determined by (i) positive TST or IGRA or (ii) CXR findings suggestive of spontaneously healed tuberculosis. After TNF inhibitor initiation, patients were recommended to undergo CXR at a specified interval.
   Results: Of 469 patients, 187 were treated for LTBI. Among them, 181 patients were treated for LTBI because of a positive TST or IGRA result. TST was considered positive if induration size was >= 10 mm. The remaining six patients were considered positive on the basis of CXR findings compatible with spontaneously healed tuberculosis, such as noncalcified nodules with distinct margins and fibrotic linear opacity, despite demonstrating negative results for TST and IGRA. Thus, CXR had a diagnostic value as a baseline LTBI test in 6 (1.3%) patients. After TNF inhibitor initiation, 2 patients who had respiratory symptoms were diagnosed with active tuberculosis. For asymptomatic patients, routine CXR follow-up could not detect any case of active pulmonary tuberculosis within 1 year (n = 219) or after 1 year (n = 217).
   Conclusions: CXR should be performed as one of the LTBI screening tests for patients with inflammatory arthritis in a tuberculosis-prevalent country. However, after TNF inhibitor treatment, routine CXR follow-up was not advantageous.

   MANAGEMENT; EFFICACY
AB Background: Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is mandatory before bronchoscopy lung volume reduction (BLVR); there is scant information about its efficacy post-BLVR. We retrospectively evaluated pulmonary function (PF) and disability in patients pre/post-BLVR and its additive effect on an intensive PR program post-BLVR vs matched non-BLVR controls. We analyzed changes within BLVR patients according to presence or not of atelectasis.
   Methods: We compared PF and exercise tolerance (6-min walk test, 6MWT) in 39 BLVR patients (FEV1% pred. 28.9 +/- 1.5; RV % pred. 236.1 +/- 7.7) pre-/post-BLVR, and vs. 32 controls (FEV1 % pred. 32.7 +/- 1.5; RV% pred. 217.8 +/- 8.3) before and after PR.
   Results: BLVR patients showed a greater improvement than controls in PF (difference between groups: 3.8 for FEV1% pred., p = 0.043; -20.5 for RV % pred., p = 0.02) and 6MWT response rate (12/39 vs. 1/39 subjects, p = 0.003). Both groups further improved significantly 6MWT after PR without a significant difference between groups. Atelectasis after BLVR mainly accounted for the improvement in FEV1% pred, RV% pred. and 6MWT compared to both BLVR without atelectasis and controls.
   Conclusion: BLVR improves PF (particularly RV) and exercise tolerance, patients with lobar exclusion being the best improvers. PR following BLVR yields a further improvement in exercise tolerance in both (atelectasis and non-atelectasis) subgroups.

AB Background: Prior studies investigating the association between endothelial dysfunction and impaired lung function have been small and inconsistent. The primary aim was to investigate the association between endothelial function and lung function in two community-based cohorts.
   Methods: We used a discovery/replication approach to study the association between endothelial function and lung function in the Prospective investigation of Obesity, Energy and Metabolism (POEM, discovery cohort, n = 490, mean age 50.3 +/- 0.2 years) and the Prospective Study of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS, replication cohort, n = 892, mean age 70.2 +/- 0.15 years). Spirometry and three different measures of endothelial function were performed including both the invasive forearm technique (endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilation [EDV and EIDV, respectively] and noninvasive flow mediated dilation [FMD]).
   Results: An age and sex adjusted association between lower EDV and lower FEV1 was found in POEM and replicated in PIVUS. After merging the two cohorts, 1 standard deviation decrease in EDV was associated with 1.57% lower FEV1 after additional adjustment for smoking status, body mass index, exercise level, and C-reactive protein (95% confidence intervals 0.63-2.51, p = 0.001). The association was slightly lower albeit still statistically significant after excluding participants without cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory disease and appeared stronger among previous/current smokers vs. non-smokers and in men vs. women (p for interaction = 0.2 and 0.02 respectively).
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that even individuals with sub-clinical impairments of lung function in the community have concomitant endothelial dysfunction.

AB Background: Human regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a heterogeneous population which consists of three distinct subpopulations: CD25(+)CD45RA(+) resting Treg (rTreg) cells; CD25(hi)CD45RA(-) activated Treg (aTreg) cells, which are both suppressive; and CD25(+)CD45RA(-) cytokine-secreting T cells with pro-inflammatory capacity.
   Objective: We investigated variation in peripheral Treg subpopulations of asthma and explored their potential roles in asthma inflammation.
   Methods: Twenty-eight mild asthma patients, 26 moderate asthma patients, 18 severe asthma patients, and 36 healthy controls were recruited for a cross-sectional study. Phenotyping of peripheral CD4(+) Tregs was performed based on flow cytometry results.
   Results: The proportions of rTreg and aTreg cells among CD4(+) T cells were higher in mild and moderate asthma patients than in healthy controls. All three groups of asthmatics had a higher proportion of pro-inflammatory Tregs than healthy controls, and these increased with asthma severity. The proportion of IL-17-producing Foxp3(+) cells and IFN-gamma-producing Foxp3(+) cells strongly correlated with T helper 17 (Th17) cells (r = 0.66, p < 0.001) and Thl cells (r = 0.48, p < 0.001). The pro-inflammatory Treg subpopulation was correlated with the severity of asthma and may be insensitive to corticosteroids.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that pro-inflammatory Treg subpopulations may be relevant to the plasticity of Th17 and Th1 differentiation and play an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma.

AB The availability of new medications has improved exercise capacity, enhanced quality of life, and extended time to clinical worsening in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). For many of these medications, careful individualized dose titration is required to maximize therapeutic effectiveness while minimizing side effects. In addition, specific routes of administration, including intravenous (IV), subcutaneous (SC), and inhaled administration may present additional challenges for patients and healthcare providers. These challenges include the possibility of catheter-related infections (IV), infusion site pain (SC), and adherence to frequent dosing schedules (inhaled). Temporary discontinuations may require re-titration and, in some cases, may even be life threatening. Here, based on our clinical experience, we provide our recommendations for dose titration schemes for PAH medications that require individualized dosing in adult patients, including agents acting on the endothelin-1 pathway (bosentan and ambrisentan), the prostacyclin pathway (epoprostenol, treprostinil, and selexipag), and the nitric oxide pathway (tadalafil and the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat). A case study that illustrates the application of best practices for PAH medication dose titration in a real-world setting is presented. Good two-way communication between specialty pharmacies and other healthcare providers promotes optimal medication usage and patient health. Experience has shown that slow, cautious up-titration is generally associated with better long-term outcomes. In all cases, patient education, frequent monitoring and careful management of side effects, and treatment adherence are critical.

AB Background: Respiratory-related hospitalization, in particular acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AE-IPF), is common and associated with increasing mortality in patients with IPF. We aimed to evaluate the implications of a newly proposed framework of acute respiratory deterioration (ARD) and AE-IPF in hospitalized patients.
   Methods: Using the data of an IPF cohort consisting of 225 consecutive patients, we retrospectively studied first hospitalizations from January 2008 to December 2017. We analysed the demographics and 90-day mortality of patients with AE-IPF and those with parenchymal cause of ARD other than AE.
   Results: Among 122 patients with first hospitalization for ARD, 35 patients were diagnosed with AE-IPF, including 11 patients with triggered AE. Parenchymal cause of ARD other than AE was diagnosed in 71 patients, and extra-parenchymal cause in 16 patients. Almost all hospitalized patients (93%) underwent chest CT, and 83% of patients with AE-IPF underwent bronchoalveolar lavage. There was a significant difference in the antiinflammatory therapy between the AE-IPF group and parenchymal cause of ARD other than AE group (p < 0.001). AE-IPF was independently associated with poor survival in multivariate Cox proportional regression analysis.
   Conclusions: AE-IPF accounted for about 30% of first hospitalizations for ARD, and differentiation between AEIPF and the other categories in ARD is important from a therapeutic and a prognostic point of view.

TI Prevalence of sleep problems and sleep-related characteristics in
   preschool- and school-aged children with cerebral palsy
SO SLEEP MEDICINE

ID DISTURBANCE SCALE; DISORDERS; QUESTIONNAIRE; SDSC
AB Objectives: To determine, in preschool- and school-aged children with cerebral palsy (CP): (i) the prevalence of sleep disorders, including disorders of initiation and maintenance of sleep, and (ii) the association between child characteristics and sleep disorders.
   Methods: Children with CP aged 3-12 years were recruited from neurology clinics and a provincial CP registry. Caregivers completed the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) and a questionnaire on sleep-related characteristics. Children's medical information was collected from the registry and hospital records.
   Results: 150 children with CP (mean age +/- standard deviation: 6.9 +/- 2.9 years) completed the study (66 preschool-and 84 school-aged children). An abnormal total score on the SDSC was found in 20.7% of children (10.6% and 28.6% of preschool-and school-aged children, respectively). Overall, 44.0% of children had one or more sleep disorder (24.2% and 59.5% in preschool-and school-aged children, respectively), as determined by subscales of the SDSC. The most common sleep problem, disorders of initiation and maintenance of sleep, was found in 26.0% of children (18.2% of preschool- and 32.1% of school-aged children, respectively). Pain was the strongest predictor of having an abnormal total score and disorders of initiation and maintenance of sleep, with odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 6.5 (2.2-18.9) and 3.4 (1.3-9.3), respectively, adjusted for age group and degree of motor impairment.
   Conclusions: Sleep disorders are prevalent in children with CP, with higher frequencies in school-aged as compared to preschool-aged children. Health care professionals caring for this population should routinely inquire about sleep problems and pain. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: This study aimed to investigate longitudinal relationships between sleep problems and subtypes of anxiety symptoms among adolescent earthquake survivors.
   Methods: Participants were 1573 adolescents (male, 45.8%; mean age at baseline 15.01 years, standard deviation (SD) = 1.26) in the Wenchuan Earthquake Adolescent Health Cohort. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders were used to assess participants' sleep problems and anxiety symptoms four times during 2.5 years after the earthquake. Anxiety symptoms included subtypes of panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), separation anxiety disorder (SeAD), social phobia (SP), school phobia (ScP). Longitudinal lagged generalized estimating equations (GEE) models were used to determine the prospective associations.
   Results: Overall, there was a bidirectional relationship between sleep problems and anxiety symptoms. For the specific sleep problems and anxiety subtypes, short sleep duration predicted symptoms of PD, GAD, and ScP, and was predicted by GAD; difficulty falling asleep predicted GAD symptoms, whereas PD symptoms increased difficulty falling asleep; poor sleep quality predicted ScP symptoms and was predicted by symptoms of GAD and ScP; difficulty maintaining sleep was not associated with any subtype of anxiety symptoms in any direction; SeAD and SP were not associated with any specific sleep problems in any direction.
   Conclusion: While sleep problems and anxiety symptoms are bidirectional, the associations vary by subtypes of sleep problems and anxiety symptoms. The potential biological mechanisms for the specific associations between dimensional sleep and anxiety symptoms and their clinical implications should be further investigated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: Sleep dysfunction has been speculated to be involved in the pathological mechanism of nocturnal enuresis (NE). However, results obtained from previous studies were conflicting. This study evaluated and compared the sleep patterns and problems between children with and without nocturnal enuresis (NE) across different age and gender groups in a large epidemiological study.
   Methods: A multi-center, cross-sectional, epidemiological study was carried out in which 21,439 primary school children (10,655 boys and 10,784 girls aged 5.1-12.9 years) and their parents participated. Chinese versions of the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire and the General Condition Questionnaire were used to identify nocturnal enuresis, sociodemographic characteristics, sleep patterns, and sleep problems in children. The sleep patterns and problems were compared between children with and without NE while controlling for a number of confounding factors in different age and gender groups.
   Results: It was observed that children with NE (especially boys aged 11-12 years with severe NE) slept for a shorter period and were more likely to have sleep problems such as bedtime resistance, sleep duration disorder, night awakening, sleep anxiety, sleep-disordered breathing, and daytime sleepiness than those without NE. Girls with NE were more likely to suffer from other types of parasomnias.
   Conclusion: Children with NE, especially older boys with severe NE, were more sleep compromised than those without NE. Our findings warrant further research on the mechanism of NE and may have clinical implications for the treatment of childhood sleep problems and NE. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Franz Kafka; Insomnia; Sleep hygiene
ID SLEEP
AB Objective: To characterize the insomnia suffered by Franz Kafka (1883-1924), one of the most important literary figures of the 20th century.
   Methods: We read Kafka's diaries and private correspondence to his fiancee, friends, editors and relatives looking for references to his insomnia.
   Results: We found 292 references to insomnia indicating that Kafka suffered from chronic insomnia disorder that originated from and was maintained by the following predisposing and precipitating factors: (1) a complex personality predisposing to an increased arousal level, (2) intrusive thoughts and ruminations at bedtime, (3) excessive worrying about sleep loss and its daytime consequences, and (4) an extraordinary intolerance to noise. Since he could not sleep at night and felt the necessity to compose his literary works in an absolutely quiet environment, Kafka deliberately changed his sleep-wake schedule so he could write at night and nap in the afternoon. These maladaptive sleep habits perpetuated his insomnia and led to chronic sleep deprivation resulting in fatigue, lack of concentration and sleep-related auditory, tactile and visual hallucinations. Kafka sought help in alternative medicine however this was ineffective in improving his insomnia.
   Conclusions: Kafka suffered from chronic insomnia disorder and had inadequate sleep hygiene resulting in chronic sleep deprivation. These sleep problems impaired Kafka's quality of life. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: This study investigated the association between secondhand-smoke (SHS) exposure and sleep disturbance symptoms.
   Methods: This study was a cross-sectional survey of junior and senior high school students throughout Japan. A total of 85,931 adolescents responded, and 84,988 questionnaires were included in the analysis.
   Results: Adolescents who had never smoked accounted for 88.0% of respondents; among that group 39.1% reported having been exposed to SHS over the previous week. The results of multiple logistic regression analyses indicated that the adjusted odds ratios for insomnia symptoms such as difficulty initiating sleep (DIS), difficulty maintaining sleep (DMS) and early morning awakening (EMA), as well as sleep disturbance symptoms such as subjectively insufficient sleep and short sleep duration (<6 h), tended to be higher both among never-smoking adolescents with SHS exposure and among smoking adolescents, as compared with never-smoking adolescents without SHS exposure. When adolescents with one or more of DIS, DMS, and EMA were defined as having insomnia, the adjusted odds ratio for insomnia was highest for adolescents who smoked, followed in descending order by those exposed to SHS both inside and outside the home, those exposed to SHS only inside the home, those exposed to SHS only outside the home, and never-smoking adolescents without SHS exposure (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: The present study has revealed that SHS exposure is associated with sleep disturbance. Thus, in addition to smoking cessation programs, it is also necessary to endorse measures to protect adolescents from SHS exposure in order to promote good sleep in this population.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to examine sleep and psycho-behavioral variables in Georgian Internally Displaced (ID) Children and their population-based controls.
   Methods: One hundred and sixty one children (10.85 +/- 0.9) from ID families escaped from Shida Kartli, Georgia, and 161 non-ID children (10.94 +/- 0.9) were studied after seven years of displacement. Children completed the Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale, Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ), Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), and the Child Trauma Screening Questionnaire (CTSQ). In addition, we assessed the children's appraisal of the family environment. Moreover, parents reported socio-demographic information, their children's academic excellence, and completed the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC), Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).
   Results: Compared with the control group, ID children had a lower level of academic excellence and family environment (p < 0.01) as well as higher scores in all SDSC dimensions with the significant difference for breathing (p < 0.001), hyperhidrosis and SDSC total scores (p < 0.05). Cognitive pre-sleep arousal was significantly higher in non-IDs (p < 0.01), while there was no difference between groups in somatic pre-sleep arousal level. All BPAQ component and total scores were higher in IDs than in non-IDs but the difference was significant only in Physical Aggression (p < 0.01). Mean scores for BDI and PSS were significantly higher in ID than non-ID parents (p < 0.001). Both cognitive and somatic pre-sleep arousal predicted SDSC total score in non-IDs (p < 0.01) while cognitive but not somatic arousal was significant predictor in IDs (p < 0.01).
   Conclusion: Sleep and psycho-behavioral problems are noticeable even in those ID children who were very young at the time of displacement. Psycho-social environment in which children are growing up warrants major consideration in ID population. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background/Objective: Many studies have shown a U-shaped association of sleep duration with mortality; however, this association is difficult to interpret owing to possible reverse causation, residual confounding, and measurement issues. We used data from the Women's Health Initiative to examine the associations of sleep duration, insomnia, and use of sleep aids with death from cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, "other" causes, and all causes combined.
   Methods: Cox proportional hazards models were used in the analysis of baseline data and in time-dependent analyses of repeated measures to estimate associations of sleep-related factors with mortality. Among 158,203 women with information regarding sleep, 30,400 total deaths, 8857 CVD deaths, 9284 cancer deaths, and 11,928 other deaths were ascertained over a median of 17.8 years.
   Results: In both baseline and time-dependent analyses, both short (<= 5 h) and long sleep (>= 9 h) durations were associated with increased risk of total, CVD, and "other" deaths, but not with cancer deaths. Insomnia showed no association with mortality, whereas use of sleep medications was associated with an increased mortality risk.
   Conclusions: While our findings showed a small but robust association of sleep duration with mortality in postmenopausal women, studies including objective measurements of sleep quality and efficiency are needed to clarify these associations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to assess cardiovascular autonomic modulation in children with upper airway obstruction (UAO), to compare this modulation to that of non-snoring children and to investigate the effect of adenotonsillectomy (AT).
   Methods: ECG and finger photoplethysmographic signals obtained from overnight polysomnographic (PSG) recordings of 31 children with mild-to-moderate UAO and 34 non-snoring children were analysed. The extent of autonomic modulation was assessed by symbolic analysis of heart period (HP), pulse wave amplitude (PWA), and their joint dynamics during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.
   Results: Children with UAO showed more frequent patterns of monotonically increasing and decreasing HP in NREM sleep and monotonically increasing and decreasing joint PWA-HP patterns in REM and NREM sleep at baseline compared to controls, even when considering only periods of sleep free of discrete respiratory events. Following AT, HP, and joint PWA-HP dynamics significantly altered towards levels observed in the control group.
   Conclusions: In children with mild-to-moderate UAO, cardiovascular autonomic modulation is more prevalent, even during quiet, event-free sleep. AT appears to reverse this pattern. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives/Background: Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy (T&A) lead to resolution of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in most children. However, OSA persists in about 25-40% of children. Cinematic magnetic resonance imaging (cine MRI) can aid the management of persistent OSA by localizing airway obstruction. We describe our experience in implementing and optimizing a cine MRI protocol by using a 3 Tesla MRI scanner, and the use of dexmedetomidine for sedation to improve reproducibility, safety, and diagnostic accuracy.
   Patients/Methods: Patients aged 3-18 years who underwent cine MRI for the evaluation of persistent OSA after T&A and failed positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy were included. Clinical data and the apnea-hyponea index were compared with quantitative and qualitative estimates of airway obstruction from imaging sequences.
   Results: A total of 36 children were included with a mean age of 9.6 +/- 4.6 (SD) years with 40% over 12 years of age. Two-thirds of them were boys. Seventeen out of 36 children (47%) had Down syndrome. Single site and multilevel obstruction were identified in 21 of 36 patients (58%) and in 12 of 36 patients (33%), respectively. All cine MRIs were performed without complications. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that a combination of the minimum airway diameter and body mass index z-score best predicted OSA severity (P = 0.002).
   Conclusions: Cine MRI is a sensitive, safe, and noninvasive modality for visualizing upper airway obstruction in children with persistent OSA after T&A. Accurate identification of obstruction can assist in surgical planning in children who fail PAP therapy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; TRAFFIC NOISE; ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE; CORTISOL SECRETION;
   HEART-RATE; STRESS; POLLUTION; ARCHITECTURE; ASSOCIATION; PERFORMANCE
AB Background: Nighttime environmental noise affects sleep quality. However, the effects of daytime occupational noise remain unclear.
   Methods: A quasi-experiment of 48 participants who had been employed for at least six months in two hospital cafeterias. The participants were randomly designated to be assessed on high- and low-noise workdays for 8 h or low- and high-noise workdays, separated by a washout period of 14 days. Subsequently, pure tone audiometry, autonomic nervous system (ANS) function tests, serum cortisol tests, and polysomnography were conducted.
   Results: For the 40 participants in the study, the 8-h time-weighted average of personal noise exposed on high- and low-noise workdays was 76.8 dBA (standard deviation, SD: 6.2) and 61.0 dBA (SD: 7.1), respectively. Participants with higher personal noise exposure during the day were found to have a lower percentage of slow wave sleep (percent change of mean value: -1.287%; 95% CI: -2.602%, -0.037%) and lower sleep efficiency (-0.267%; 95% CI: -0.525%, -0.008%). In addition, after work, personal noise exposure was revealed to be related to increased serum cortisol levels (1.698%; 95% CI: 0.887%, 2.528%), and sympathetic activity as measured by low frequency/high frequency (3.000%; 95% CI: 1.294%, 4.706%) and blood pressures by cold pressor test (systolic: 5.163%; 95% CI: 2.780%, 7.537%) (diastolic: 3.109%; 95% CI: 1.604%, 4.614%).
   Conclusions: Daytime occupational noise exposure had sustained effects on nighttime sleep quality, specifically on slow wave sleep and sleep efficiency. These disturbances could be partially explained by post-shift elevated cortisol and ANS activity. The psychosocial and metabolic consequences of poorer sleep quality induced by occupational noise exposure warrant further investigation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: An insomnia characterized by nighttime symptoms and daytime impairment is common. GABA-A receptor agonist (GABAA-RA) treatment is often used, but long-term use is controversial due to the poor risk-benefit ratio resulting from drug dependence and potential cognitive impairment. This study evaluated the effectiveness of add-on cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and GABAA-RA dose-tapering in patients with primary insomnia resistant to pharmacotherapy.
   Methods: This randomized, multicenter, two-arm, parallel-group study compared CBT-I and treatment as usual (TAU) in patients with persistent primary insomnia despite GABAA-RA treatment. Screening was based on sleep diary entries, with >= 31-min sleep latency or wake after sleep onset, occurring >= 3 times in a week and total score of >= 8 on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Primary outcome measures were severity of insomnia and GABAA-RA tapering rate.
   Results: A total of 51 patients were randomized and 49 patients were analyzed (CBT-I; n = 23, TAU; n = 26). A mixed-effects repeated-measures model revealed significant improvement in insomnia symptoms (ISI score) during the post-intervention (PI) and follow-up (FU) periods in the CBT-I versus the TAU group (PI; 10.91 vs. 14.33, p < 0.05, FU; 10.17 vs. 14.34, p < 0.01). GABAA-RA tapering rate approached 30% during follow-up in the CBT-I group; no significant intergroup difference was observed.
   Conclusion: Add-on CBT-I improved insomnia symptoms that were unresponsive to GABAA-RA therapy. No effect on tapering rate was observed in this study. CBT-I may promote dose reduction by optimizing the protocol and duration of treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Idiopathic nightmares are a common disturbance of rapid eye movement sleep (REM) sleep, but studies of comorbid pathologies and sleep architecture suggest that non-REM (NREM) sleep is also affected. Sleep spindles are a NREM sleep characteristic associated with both pathophysiology and sleep-dependent memory consolidation, yet they have not been evaluated in frequent nightmare recallers. The morning naps of 38 participants with frequent idiopathic nightmares (mean age: 23.7 +/- 3.78 years) and 25 age- and sex-matched controls (23.9 +/- 3.65 years) were recorded and their sleep evaluated. A custom spindle detector assessed NREM sleep stage 2 (N2) sleep spindles on six electroencephalogram (EEG) derivations (F3, F4, C3, C4, O1, and O2) for density (number spindles/N2 time), mean frequency, and amplitude. Total spindles (10-16 Hertz (Hz) range), slow spindles (10-12.79 Hz), and fast spindles (12.8-16 Hz) were all assessed separately. Compared with the Control group, the Nightmare group had longer N2 sleep latency and a marginally greater %N2 sleep. The Nightmare group also had a lower than normal density of slow spindles in most EEG derivations, a higher density of fast spindles in frontal derivations, and an elevated fast spindle oscillatory frequency-"faster fast" spindles-mainly in central derivations. These differences withstood controls for pre-existing group differences in depression. Correlational analyses demonstrated a further pattern of group differences by which higher pathology scores were associated with higher slow spindle densities and slower spindle frequencies for the Nightmare but not the Control group. A similar pattern was observed for some dream content measures, ie, the Nightmare group showed positive correlations of slow spindle density with dreamed fear and word count and negative correlations with dreamed positive emotion. Conversely, the Control group showed opposite trends. Results thus demonstrate abnormalities in the composition of N2 sleep-and especially in N2 spindles-among frequent nightmare recallers and link these abnormalities to both trait (psychopathology) and state (dream content) factors. Spindle findings for psychopathology resemble, but are not identical with, previous findings for patients with major depression, social anxiety, and schizophrenia and are thus consistent with an explanation implicating spindles as trait markers of psychopathology. Correlational analyses go beyond a trait explanation to suggest several possible state-based explanations involving memory consolidation mechanisms, specifically, the possibility that spindles index either emotional or verbal task-based processes.

AB Objective: To examine changes in functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) that are induced by sleep deprivation, and to identify individual differences that contribute to the vulnerability of the brain's response to sleep deprivation.
   Methods: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned 51 healthy young subjects during the resting state. Of these participants, 28 were scanned following 24 h of sleep deprivation, and 23 age and education-matched control subjects were scanned after being well rested.
   Results: Independent component analysis was conducted to identify the DMN. Unlike previous studies that consider the DMN as one homogeneous network, the present study found a dissociable effect of sleep deprivation on two subsystems of the DMN. Functional connectivity within the dorsal DMN decreased; this was correlated with longer response times in a psychomotor vigilance task (PVT). An enhanced functional connectivity was found within the ventral DMN as well as between two subsystems, after sleep deprivation. In addition, between-subsystems connectivity was positively correlated with working memory and negatively correlated with the response time of PVT, suggesting a possible compensatory effect of enhanced communication across two subsystems.
   Conclusions: The present findings suggest a dissociable effect of sleep deprivation on functional connectivity in the DMN. Lower functional connectivity in dorsal DMN was related to impairments of basic cognitive function. Notably, working memory was positively correlated with the putative compensatory enhanced functional connectivity across two subsystems, which in turn correlated with behavioral performance after sleep deprivation; this suggests that good working memory may play a protective role in sleep deprivation.

AB Objective/Background: Systematically compare four criteria for Positional Obstructive Sleep Apnea (POSA) based on AASM 2007 and 2012 hypopnea scoring definitions.
   Patients/Methods: 142 records acquired by in-home polysomnography (Sleep Profiler PSG2 (TM)) were retrospectively analyzed using AHI based on the American Academy Sleep Medicine 2007 and 2012 criteria (AHI(2007) and AHI(2012)). Positional obstructive sleep apnea (POSA) was characterized using four criteria: Amsterdam Positional OSA Classification (APOC), supine AHI twice the non-supine AHI (Cartwright), Cartwright plus the non-supine AHI < 5 (Mador), and the overall AHI severity at least 1.4 times the non-supine severity (Overall/NS-AHI).
   Results: Correlations between the Cartwright and Overall/NS-AHI criteria increased with the inclusion of a more relaxed definition of hypopneas (AHI(2007) = 0.79 and AHI(2012) = 0.86, P < 0.00001). The prevalence of POSA based on the Cartwright and Overall/NS-AHI criteria was approximately 60% in those with at least mild OSA by AHI(200)(7) and AHI(2012). A 16% reduction in POSA prevalence for AHI(20)(12) vs. AHI(2007) was attributed to the increased incident of mild OSA. For identification of those expected to have 25% or 35% reductions in SDB severity with positional therapy, Cartwright and Overall/NS-AHI exhibited the strongest sensitivity and Overall/NS-AHI and Mador the best specificity.
   Conclusions: The four criteria used to identify POSA have similarities and differences. While there were similarities between the Cartwright and Overall/NS-AHI criteria in the detection of POSA prevalence across both scoring criteria, the Overall/NS-AHI provided the most consistent detection of those most likely to demonstrate important reductions in sleep disordered breathing severity if supine sleep is avoided.

AB Background: The most commonly performed surgical procedure for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is uvulopalatopharyngoplasty with or without tonsillectomy (UPPP +/- TE). However, there is currently no review solely focusing on clinically relevant effects of standard UPPP technique with or without tonsillectomy as a monotherapy in patients with OSA.
   Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to assess the effects of isolated UPPP +/- TE in patients with OSA. Studies of any design referring to adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea diagnosed via polysomnography or comparable objective measures were considered, in which isolated "standard" UPPP +/- TE was performed.
   Results: Forty-eight studies were included for the qualitative analysis. All but one study demonstrated a reduction in the frequency of respiratory events and success/response rates ranged from 35 to 95.2%. In the six studies that reported pre-and postoperative mean scores of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), a reduction in sleepiness scores was demonstrated. Data addressing the effect of UPPP +/- TE in comparison to no treatment or control were available from two randomized controlled trials (RCT). When pooling the data, UPPP +/- TE was significantly more effective in reducing the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) (large effect): an AHI mean difference (MD) of -18.59 (95% CI -34.14, -3.04) and an ESS MD of -5.37 (95% CI -7,03, -3.72). Data addressing effect of UPPP +/- TE in comparison to baseline was available from three RCT. When pooling the data, the AHI was reduced from a mean 35.4 to 17.9 (49.5% reduction); a MD of -20.41, 95% CI -32.78, -8.04 (-1.80, -1.15) (large effect). Various additional beneficial effects of UPPP +/- TE were demonstrated including improvement in sexual function, ventricular function, sleep stages, serum lipid, depressive disorder and driving performance.
   Conclusion: UPPP +/- TE reduces respiratory events and daytime sleepiness in adult patients with OSA and UPPP +/- TE is superior to non-treated controls in this regard. Further research is needed to establish the long-term benefit, the impact on cardiovascular morbidity and the role of UPPP +/- TE in the variety of available treatment options for OSA.

AB Background: The tendency for adolescents to have restricted sleep has been examined in numerous studies; however, the impact of sleep restriction on adolescents' neural activity during sleep (measured by electroencephalography (EEG)) is less extensively researched, particularly regarding sleep spindles.
   Methods: In this experimental study, 34 adolescents attended a 10-day laboratory study where they received five consecutive nights of either 5 h, 7.5 h or 10 h of sleep opportunity, with one adaptation, one baseline and two recovery nights of 10 h of sleep opportunity before and after the experimental phase.
   Results: Both within- and between-subjects effects were observed for fast sleep spindle characteristics of density, duration and amplitude. Overall, when experiencing severe sleep restriction, fast spindles in adolescents were lower in amplitude and longer in duration. Sex differences were also seen for fast spindle amplitude.
   Conclusions: This investigation adds to the knowledge in this field by investigating specific sleep spindle characteristics in the context of experimentally manipulated sleep. Sleep restriction is highly prevalent among adolescents. These findings indicate that chronic sleep restriction has an impact on brain activity related to sleep spindles. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: Cross-sectional studies show a lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in individuals with narcolepsy. We aimed to describe changes in HRQoL after two years of multidisciplinary follow-up in a cohort of mainly post-H1N1 vaccination narcolepsy type-1 (NT1) patients in Norway.
   Methods: Prospective-cohort study. Narcolepsy diagnosis was based on the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (third edition). Psychiatric comorbidity was assessed using the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA). HRQoL was evaluated with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL (TM) Generic Core Scales 4.0) at baseline and follow-up. Mean follow-up time was 20.7 (2.7) months.
   Results: Thirty one patients (18 females) with NT1, mean age 14.6 (SD = 4.8 ) years answered questionnaires at baseline and follow-up. On a group level, the PedsQL Total Health Summary score significantly improved by a mean of 5.9 (95%CI = 0.4,11.9), p = 0.038; this was mainly driven by improvements in the Physical Health Summary score by 9.8 (3.0,16.5) points, p = 0.006 and the School Functioning Scale score by 7.5 (1.0,13.9) points p = 0.025. The Total ASEBA score was correlated with PedsQL Total Health Summary score at baseline, but not with changes in HRQoL. Sodium oxybate (Xyrem (R)) treatment at follow up was positively associated with changes in PedsQL Total Health Summary score, after adjusting for age and gender, p = 0.027.
   Conclusion: HRQoL in NT1 patients improved after two years of follow-up. The use of sodium oxybate (Xyrem (R)) at follow-up was associated with increases in HRQoL. Psychiatric comorbidity was correlated with HRQoL at baseline but did not predict changes in HRQoL at follow-up. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Multicentric Cryptococcomas Mimicking Neoplasia in Immunocompetent
   Patient
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Central nervous system; Cryptococcoma; Fungal; Infection
AB BACKGROUND: Fungal mass lesions in the central nervous system are, as a group, extremely rare. In this group cryptococcomas are the most common mass lesions seen. These cryptococcomas/mucinous pseudocysts are commonly only 3-10 mm in diameter and occur almost exclusively in the basal ganglia through contiguous spread from a basal meningitis through the Virchow-Robbin perivascular spaces. In rare cases a chronic granulomatous process may lead to formation of mass lesions that have a tumoral appearance.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 19-year-old male presented to our Neurosurgical Unit with a 5-month history of progressive morning headaches. He also complained of progressive weakness of his R upper limb of 3 months' duration. The patient was found to be human immunodeficiency virus negative with a CD4 count of 1763. The patient had no other medical problems. Examination revealed a monoplegia of his R upper limb. While being optimized for surgery, the patient demonstrated progression of his upper limb monoplegia despite preoperative steroid therapy aimed at decreasing the perilesional vasogenic edema. He was booked for emergency resection of 2 lobar mass lesions. Histopathology analysis revealed the 2 specimens had similar features. These specimens were representative of gliotic brain parenchyma involved by extensive cryptococcosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosing the tumoral form of cryptococcosis in immunocompetent patients is a challenge. Primary and secondary brain tumors are usually the first hypotheses in these cases. Thorough preoperative investigation through cerebrospinal fluid sampling and detailed magnetic resonance imaging may lead to consideration of this diagnosis before the histopathologic analysis has been conducted.

DT Article
DE Dural arteriovenous fistula; Thalamic symptoms; Venous aneurysm
   embolization
ID CLINICAL PRESENTATION; APHASIA; LANGUAGE
AB BACKGROUND: Initial clinical presentation of dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) with predominantly thalamic symptoms is rare and has not been reported until now.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A young child presenting with complaints of tinnitus and mild right hemiparesis was evaluated with an initial magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed a Borden type 2 DAVF in the right transverse sinus with retrograde venous drainage and cortical venous reflux. Flow-related small aneurysms were also noted in the left basal vein of Rosenthal (BVR). Two days later, his motor power deteriorated and he developed right hemisensory loss and severe thalamic pain. Aphasia was atypical and mimicked the transcortical type. Repeat imaging revealed expanding thrombosed aneurysm of BVR with mass effect and edema on thalamocapsular region. Initial antiedema measures reversed the neurologic deficits; however, they recurred, necessitating an urgent endovascular intervention. Angiogram revealed an extensive high-flow DAVF in the right transverse-sigmoid sinus and torcula with preferential retrograde venous drainage into deep veins and left BVR. He underwent staged embolization of DAVF, resulting in significant obliteration of shunt. Neurologic deficits improved in the postoperative period, and the patient remained clinically asymptomatic at 6 months of follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: DAVF presenting with recurrent predominantly thalamic symptoms is rare. Atypical transcortical aphasia rather than fluent aphasia is an unusual clinical manifestation of thalamic pathology and could result from the involvement of specific thalamic nuclei. Preferential high flow into BVR in the presence of venous anomalies could potentially induce architectural weakness of the venous wall and precipitate aneurysm formation. Embolization of the DAVF can potentially reverse this unusual neurologic condition.

TI Hydatidosis Following Giant Cerebral Hydatid Cyst Operation
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Cerebral hydatid cyst; Hydatidosis; MRI
AB BACKGROUND: Hydatid cysts (HCs) are caused by parasites, the larvae of Echinococcus granulosus. They usually affect the liver and lung, but primary brain involvement is rarely seen. HCs may cause a mass effect in the brain. For this reason, surgical excision must be performed. Complications may rarely occur after surgery. Recognition of complications is of vital importance.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-year-old man presented with complaints of personality disorder and severe, long-standing headache. The patient had no neurologic deficit. However, there were symptoms associated with increased intracranial pressure. Radiologic examination revealed intracranial HCs. Complications did not develop during the operation. Six months following the surgery, the patient came back after experiencing unconsciousness. Control cerebral magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple cerebral cysts.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection should be applied carefully in the treatment of cerebral cysts. Complications may occur later in patients who do not develop complications at the time of operation. For this reason, follow-up of the patients should definitely be done by magnetic resonance imaging.

TI Life-Threatening Hemorrhagic Moyamoya Disease: Report of Rare Case of
   Atraumatic Acute Subdural Hematoma Due to Ruptured Transdural
   Anastomosis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Acute subdural hematoma; Moyamoya disease; Transdural anastomosis
ID SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; ANEURYSM; FEATURES; VESSELS
AB BACKGROUND: Atraumatic acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) associated with moyamoya disease (MMD) is rare, and only a few studies have reported the bleeding origin. We present a case of atraumatic ASDH attributable to a transdural anastomosis that developed owing to the compensatory mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of advanced MMD. This is the first case of life-threatening atraumatic ASDH associated with MMD in which the rupture point was clearly visualized using a 3-dimensional rotational reconstructed image.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 37-year-old woman presented with sudden-onset, serious, atraumatic ASDH requiring emergency decompressive craniectomy. The cerebral angiograms revealed that she had advanced MMD with transdural anastomosis that was classified as Suzuki stage V with a 5-mm saccular aneurysm in the middle meningeal artery on the affected side, which was suggested as the bleeding origin. Follow-up angiograms demonstrated that the aneurysm spontaneously disappeared and was inferred to be a pseudoaneurysm. We performed a left extraintracranial bypass to prevent recurrent hemorrhage. With intensive rehabilitation, the patient accordingly achieved stroke-free survival with a modified Rankin Scale score of 3 for 1 year.
   CONCLUSIONS: Atraumatic ASDH associated with MMD is a rare type of hemorrhagic MMD, and a 3-dimensional rotational reconstructed image was useful to confirm the origin of the bleeding. The transdural anastomosis development most likely correlates with the occurrence of any type of hemorrhagic MMD. We should consider that the transdural anastomosis collapse can cause a life-threatening atraumatic ASDH and should plan a surgical strategy carefully so as not to destroy collateral supply through the transdural anastomosis in such cases.

AB OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to conduct an evidence-based quantitative assessment of the correction of lumbar lordosis achieved by each of the 3 principal lumbar interbody fusion techniques: anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF), lateral lumbar interbody fusion (L-LIF), and transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF).
   METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify studies containing degrees of correction of lumbar lordosis achieved by ALIF, LLIF, and TLIF as shown on standing lumbar radiography at least 6 weeks after surgical intervention. Pooled and Forest plot analyses were performed for the studies that met inclusion criteria.
   RESULTS: For ALIF, 21 studies were identified with mean correction 4.67 degrees (standard deviation [SD] +/- 4.24) and median correction 5.20 degrees. Fifteen studies were identified that met criteria for Forest plot analysis with mean correction 4.90 degrees (standard error of the mean [SEM] +/- 0.40). For L-LIF, 17 studies were identified with mean correction 4.47 +/- (SD +/- 4.80) and median correction 4.00 degrees. Nine studies were identified that met criteria for Forest plot analysis with mean correction 2.91 degrees (SEM +/- 0.56). For TLIF, 31 studies were identified with mean correction 3.89 degrees (SD +/- 4.33) and median correction 3.50 degrees. Twenty-five studies were identified that met criteria for Forest plot analysis with mean correction 5.33 degrees (SEM +/- 0.27).
   CONCLUSIONS: We present the current evidence-based mean correction for each of the 3 principal lumbar interbody fusion techniques based on standing radiographic data.

AB BACKGROUND: The objective of this work is to report the feasibility and results of an institutional protocol for the application of an innovative biologically active hemoderivative autologous material, denominated leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin (L-PRF), in the reconstruction of endoscopic approaches to the sellar region.
   METHODS: L-PRF membranes were produced from centrifuged autologous venous blood. They were used for the reconstruction of transsphenoidal endoscopic approaches to the sellar region in 12 patients. The trophism of the mucosa was monitored during the first 30 days by means of fiberoptic endoscopic controls on the second and seventh postoperative days. Follow-up was performed to rule out complications up to 30 postoperatively days.
   RESULTS: The product obtained bore the characteristics of the original descriptions of L-PRF. Standardized preparation of L-PRF membranes promoted early regeneration of the sphenoid sinus mucosa to close endoscopic approaches to the sellar region. No complications within the first 30 postsurgical days were reported.
   CONCLUSIONS: L-PRF membranes offer characteristics that are superior to other techniques and products, mainly because of their role as biological promoters of tissue regeneration, their low economic cost, and immediate availability. However, it would be necessary to confirm these results in studies involving more patients.

TI Surgical Treatment of Intramedullary Spinal Metastasis in
   Medulloblastoma: Case Report and Review of the Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Intramedullary metastasis; Medulloblastoma; Sonic hedgehog; Spinal cord
AB BACKGROUND: Medulloblastomas are common childhood central nervous system tumors that are prone to leptomeningeal spread. Intramedullary dissemination is rare with very few case reports existing in the available literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The authors here present a case of a 14-year-old boy with Li-Fraumeni syndrome and medulloblastoma who underwent surgical resection of spinal intramedullary spread. Histopathology revealed the tumor to be anaplastic medulloblastoma, same as the intracranial lesions. Genetic testing of the metastatic deposit revealed loss of functions mutations in SUFU, NOTCH3, and TP53 and TERC amplification. An improvement in ambulatory function at short-term follow-up was noted before the patient died of disseminated disease.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intramedullary metastasis of medulloblastoma remains a rare disease. Surgical resection might play a possible role in management in addition to radiation and chemotherapy.

   cranial fossa; Pial arteriovenous fistula; Superficial temporal artery
ID INDOCYANINE GREEN VIDEOANGIOGRAPHY; CLASSIFICATION; ANGIOGRAPHY;
   MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Dural arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) in the middle cranial fossa are rare. Pial AVFs are similarly rare but differ from dural AVFs in that they derive their arterial supply from pial or cortical arterial vessels and do not lie within the intradural region. We report an extremely rare case of dural and pial AVF connected to the same drainer in the middle cranial fossa.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In a 58-year-old man with a subcortical hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe, digital subtraction angiography showed a dural AVF in the middle cranial fossa fed by the middle meningeal artery (MMA) and draining into the sphenopetrosal vein. A combination with a small pial AVF connected to the same sphenopetrosal vein was suspected. Open surgery was performed to directly observe the shunt points. Transarterial indocyanine green (ICG) angiography using the MMA via the superficial temporal artery on a skin flap was performed to repeatedly and distinctly evaluate the dural shunt points and to prevent cerebral thromboembolism. Although the dural supply was completely disconnected, the sphenopetrosal vein remained arterialized. ICG angiography revealed pial AVF, which was fed by the cortical arteries draining into the same drainer. The pial supply was completely disconnected, and disappearance of the dural and pial AVF was confirmed.
   CONCLUSIONS: We report an extremely rare case of dural and pial AVF connected to the same drainer in the middle cranial fossa. To our knowledge, this is the first such case report described in the literature.

DE Dural arteriovenous fistula; Magnetic resonance angiography; Myelopathy
AB Spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas (SDAVFs) are the most common type of spinal arteriovenous malformation and frequently cause progressive myelopathy. Early detection and surgical or endovascular intervention are important to preventing permanent neurologic impairment. Selective spinal angiography is still the gold standard for the diagnosis and localization of the SDAVF. Occasionally, these lesions may be angiographically occult. Here we report a case of an angiographically occult SDAVF, which was localized using magnetic resonance angiography. The lesion was successfully treated by direct surgery.

DE Bilateral; Endoscopy; Foramen of Monro; Stenosis
ID IDIOPATHIC OCCLUSION
AB BACKGROUND: Bilateral occlusion of the foramen of Monro with aqueductal stenosis is a rare entity. Only 1 previous case has been reported in the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a 25-year-old female who presented with chronic headache of 7 years duration. Neurologic examination revealed only papilledema. Imaging showed symmetrical dilation of both lateral ventricles with mild dilation of the third ventricle and a normal fourth ventricle, suggesting occlusion of both foramina of Monro with membranous web formation in the upper part of the aqueduct. There was tonsillar herniation without syrinx. She underwent neuroendoscopic foraminoplasty, septostomy, and third ventriculostomy. The patient experienced total relief of headache and showed reduced volume of both lateral ventricles at follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral occlusion of foramen of Monro with aqueductal stenosis and tonsillar herniation is rare cause of obstructive hydrocephalus, and can be managed effectively with neuroendoscopic procedure.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Anterior subarachnoidal cyst; Compressive myelopathy; Spinal
   arachnoiditis
ID CORD COMPRESSION; SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal cystic arachnoiditis is a rare complication of a subarachnoid haemorrhage or infectious meningitis. The inflammatory process leads to fibrosis, adhesions, and in severe cases cyst formation. Large arachnoid cysts are an uncommon cause of compressive myelopathy. The majority are located posterior of the spinal cord at the thoracic level. Anterior cyst formation is exceptional, especially at the cervical region.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present 2 cases of progressive myelopathy secondary to anterior arachnoid cyst formation. In a 54-year-old female a large anterior symptomatic thoracic cyst arose 4 years after rupture of a posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm. The other 59-year-old-patient, however, developed an anterior cervical cyst only weeks after a varicella meningoencephalitis. Both female patients were treated with a decompressive laminectomy and wide fenestration of the cysts. Partial recovery was obtained in 1 patient, but there was no improvement in the other case.
   CONCLUSIONS: Spinal cystic arachnoiditis with anterior cyst formation is an extremely rare complication of subarachnoid haemorrhage and infectious meningitis but can cause severe neurologic deficits. Clinicians should be aware of this rare complication. Due to the risk of irreversible spinal cord injury, rapid surgical intervention is recommended in most cases.

   glioblastoma; Spinal glioblastoma
ID MULTIFORME; SURVIVAL
AB BACKGROUND: Approximately 2%-10% of all central nervous system tumors are primary spinal cord tumors (SCTs). Spinal cord glioblastoma is a rare tumor type accounting for 1%-3% of all SCTs and 7.5% of all spinal cord gliomas. Notably, the small-cell variant of spinal cord glioblastoma is even rarer with only 2 previously reported cases.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present herein a case report of a rare primary spinal cord glioblastoma in a 48-year-old patient with a 2-month history of numbness in the left arm and mild cervical pain radiating to the occipital zone. Clinical examination revealed hypoalgesia and thermal dissociation of the left arm and the ipsilateral superior part of the trunk treated through subtotal surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Histologic examination of the surgical tumor specimen revealed features of the small-cell spinal cord glioblastoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is only the third reported case of small-cell spinal cord glioblastoma. The aggressive nature of this tumor variant reduces overall survival rate regardless of the treatment.

TI Clivus Inflammatory Pseudotumor Associated with Immunoglobulin
   G4-Related Disease
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE IgG4-related disease; Inflammatory pseudotumor; Meningioma
ID IGG4-RELATED HYPOPHYSITIS; FEATURES; MENINGIOMA
AB BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease is a more recently recognized syndrome. It is characterized by increasing IgG4-positive plasma cells and lymphocyte infiltration. Reports of intracranial pseudotumors associated with IgG4-related disease are very rare. We report a rare case of clivus pseudotumor associated with IgG4-related disease mimicking meningioma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old man presented with abducens paralysis of the right eye. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a uniformly enhanced mass located in the right upper clivus area, and meningioma was highly suspected. The tumor was totally resected via a retrosigmoid approach craniotomy, which achieved sufficient decompression of the right abducens nerve. Postoperative pathology revealed IgG4-related disease with IgG4 strongly positive on immunohistochemical staining. The patient had no history of autoimmune disease. Postoperative laboratory data revealed no elevation of either IgG (6.94 g/L) or IgG4 (0.131 g/L). Follow-up contrast MRI showed the lesion had disappeared.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although several cases of intrasellar hypophysitis have been reported, reports of intracranial pseudotumors associated with IgG4-related disease are rare. Special attention is required when the differential diagnosis includes meningioma. Preoperative diagnosis is very important because inflammatory pseudotumors associated with IgG4-related disease could be treated with steroid therapy, avoiding surgery.

ID REVASCULARIZATION; OCCLUSION; INFARCTION; STENOSIS; PROFILE
AB BACKGROUND: Although it is well-known that vertebrobasilar insufficiency (VBI) because of atherothrombosis with bilateral vertebral artery (VA) occlusion is resistant to medical treatment from the acute to subacute stages, the most appropriate treatment for progressive infarction at these stages remains unclear. Here, we described a patient with VBI who underwent emergency superficial temporal artery-superior cerebellar artery (STA-SCA) bypass under partial mastoidectomy after confirming mismatch between diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) findings and clinical symptoms. The patient showed a good outcome with this approach. To our knowledge, our surgical strategy has not been previously reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 71-year-old woman with progressive infarction because of atherothrombosis with bilateral VA occlusions resistant to maximum medical treatment. Emergency STA-SCA bypass under partial mastoidectomy was performed after confirming DWI findings and symptom mismatch. A good outcome was archived, and no additional cerebral infarctions were noted.
   CONCLUSIONS: Emergency bypass should be considered as a treatment option for VBI that is resistant to maximal medical treatment after confirming DWI findings and symptom mismatch. Our approach involving partial mastoidectomy provides a wide and shallow operative field for STA-SCA bypass, which allows accurate bypass with good outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe a novel modified guidewire technique used in the placement of percutaneous pedicle screws (PPSs), which enables safe and precise control of the depth of screw placement and prevents excessive advancement of the guidewire with low radiation exposure. PPSs have been widely used and have many advantages. However, inadvertent advancement of the guidewire may damage peripheral tissue or viscera, and repeated confirmation of the depth of screw and guidewire leads to extensive radiation exposure.
   METHODS: A modified guidewire with markers was used intraoperatively. The reading of the mark on the guidewire increased as the PPS advanced into the pedicle. The depth of the screw in the pedicle was calculated as the mark reading after each screw was rotated into the pedicle minus the initial mark reading. After all pedicle screws were placed, the positions of the screws were checked by C-arm or G-arm fluoroscopy.
   RESULTS: The modified guidewire was applied in 41 thoracic-lumbar fracture patients. The depths of the percutaneous screws were precisely controlled as planned. There were no inadvertent breaches of the anterior cortices of the vertebrae. No patients reported neurologic symptoms, and there was no screw misplacement detected. Surgeons had no radiation exposure, and patients were only exposed once to the radiation.
   CONCLUSIONS: The modified guidewire with markers is an effective device to precisely control the depth of PPSs and prevent complications of the guidewire in the placement of pedicle screws.

AB A 55-year-old male who complained of frequent back pain accompanied by increasing weakness in the lower extremities was admitted to our hospital's Neurosurgery Department. No additional disease was in his history. Magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic area, anterior epidural space, and paravertebral area revealed an approximately 55 x 9 mm lymphoma pressuring the spinal cord from the anterior. It was fusiformed with a dural tail, hypointense on sagittal T1-weighted imaging series, and hypointense on sagittal T2-weighted imaging series compared with the spinal cord, showing contrast enhancement. After gadolinium application, an extra-axial mass lesion was detected. The lesion was surgically removed from the patient, whom we thought had meningioma on the basis of radiology. However, histopathology resulted in the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

AB OBJECTIVE: Increased restrictions on working hours and the resultant decrease in theater time coupled with greater scrutiny to demonstrate proficiency at surgical tasks has resulted in the incorporation of simulators for surgical training. This literature review describes the use of cadaveric simulators in postgraduate neurosurgical training, with the aim to analyze their effectiveness in improving surgical performance.
   METHODS: An electronic literature search of the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases was conducted to identify studies that look at the efficacy of cadaveric simulation in neurosurgical training. Studies that were eligible were those that assessed either objectively or subjectively the effectiveness of human cadaver models in cranial or spinal neurosurgical training. Studies that did not assess efficacy on training, looked at animal cadavers, or noncadaveric simulators were excluded.
   RESULTS: Twelve studies were deemed to meet the eligibility criteria. Only 4 of the studies used objective measures to assess the effectiveness of cadaveric simulators on training. Most studies reported a positive impact of cadaveric simulators on training.
   CONCLUSIONS: Most studies identified in this review failed to provide strong objective evidence for effectiveness in achieving competency and good outcomes in the theatres. Lack of use of validated skills assessment tools prevented studies from associating cadaveric training with improvement in operating skills. Future studies should aim to address these shortcomings and focus on validating cadaveric simulation, ensuring only those that improve performance of both technical and nontechnical skills are pursued.

   OSTEOPROTEGERIN; MANAGEMENT; EXPRESSION
AB BACKGROUND: Giant cell tumors (GCTs) are a locally aggressive primary bone neoplasm of osteoclast-like cells. These lesions largely occur in the epiphyses of long bones, but there have been rare reports of occurrence in the pelvis, spine, or skull. Of those located in the skull, involvement of the clivus has been rarely reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of an 18-year-old woman presenting with a third nerve palsy, found to have a lytic lesion of the upper clivus that was primarily treated with endoscopic endonasal resection. Her third nerve palsy resolved postoperatively, and subsequent histopathologic analysis revealed a GCT. Six-month postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed progression of residual disease for which she was treated with adjuvant denosumab. This treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the tumor size. She subsequently underwent proton beam radiation. At 1-year postsurgery, the patient's MRI remained stable after completing denosumab and proton therapy. She was neurologically intact and had no issues from her treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: Denosumab has demonstrated anti-GCT efficacy. In combination with proton therapy, it has the potential to spare a young, vulnerable population from adverse long-term effects of traditional adjuvant radiation therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of denosumab in the treatment of GCT of the clivus in the United States.

AB OBJECTIVE: Invasive, medically refractory, and multiply recurrent pituitary adenomas pose a rare, but nevertheless significant, challenge for conventional management modalities. Temozolomide (TMZ) has been reported to be useful as an adjunctive treatment for some patients. We describe the efficacy of TMZ when used early in the management of invasive prolactinoma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old man presented with an invasive, refractory macroprolactinoma for which long-term dopamine agonists, stereotactic radiosurgery, and multiple transsphenoidal surgical resections had failed. He had experienced persistent hyperprolactinemia and tumor progression. Thus, TMZ was started. During the 11 cycles of TMZ therapy, the patient's prolactin level decreased from 696 ng/mL to 15.2 ng/mL, with a > 90% decrease in tumor size. Nearly 6 years after discontinuing chemotherapy, the patient remained in sustained remission (prolactin level, 3.1 ng/mL) requiring only 1.5 mg of cabergoline weekly, without radiographic or clinical evidence of tumor recurrence.
   CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that TMZ can be efficacious in the management of medically and surgically refractory, invasive atypical prolactinomas, resulting in normalization of the prolactin levels and control of the tumor size. We encourage the inclusion of TMZ in the management of refractory, recurrent, and invasive prolactinomas, as a fourth-line treatment strategy, after dopamine agonist treatment, transsphenoidal resection, and radiation therapy. We especially advocate the early use of TMZ for aggressive and otherwise refractory prolactinomas.

ID OF-THE-LITERATURE; SPINAL ENTEROGENOUS CYSTS; CORD; ABNORMALITIES;
   MANAGEMENT; EXCISION; CHILDREN
AB BACKGROUND: Neurenteric cysts are rare congenital lesions derived from an anomalous connection between the primitive ectoderm and endoderm.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 2-month-old infant presented with an insidious onset of upper limb weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed a contrast-enhancing solid mass located anterior to the spinal cord at the level of the cervicothoracic junction, which was isointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. The lesion was associated with marked spinal cord compression and also with a giant intramedullary cyst that extended proximally into the cranium. Spinal dysraphism was noted. The patient underwent cervicothoracic laminotomy, drainage of the cyst contents, and a complete excision of the solid component. Neurologic function recovery was observed postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: We report and discuss the clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and neuroradiologic findings in an infantile case of a giant craniospinal intramedullary neurenteric cyst. Early recognition is beneficial because of its benign nature and good clinical outcome following total surgical resection.

TI Completely Thrombosed Giant Intracranial Aneurysm with Spontaneous
   Thrombosis of the Parent Artery: Is It Nature's Divine Intervention and
   a Self-Cure?

DE Angiogram; Conservative treatment; Giant intracranial aneurysm;
   Spontaneous thrombosis; Thrombosed aneurysm
ID INTERNAL CAROTID-ARTERY; INTRACAVERNOUS ANEURYSM; SACCULAR ANEURYSM;
   OCCLUSION; RECANALIZATION
AB BACKGROUND: Although partial thrombosis is common with intracranial aneurysms, complete aneurysmal thrombosis is extremely rare. An even rarer and seldom reported phenomenon is the spontaneous complete occlusion of the parent artery in the presence of a thrombosed aneurysm. Given the unclear natural history of this phenomenon, therapeutic decision making may be rather difficult. Here we report a case of right cavernous carotid artery aneurysm with spontaneous right internal carotid artery (ICA) thrombosis in a 45-year-old man.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Our patient presented almost 1 month after an episode of sudden-onset severe holocranial headache associated with vomiting that had resolved completely within 2 days. He was neurologically intact at the time of presentation. A computed tomography (CT) scan done at the time of ictus showed a rounded hyperdensity with the epicenter at the right parasellar region along with nonvisualization of the ipsilateral ICA on CT angiography. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested a diagnosis of a completely thrombosed right cavernous segment ICA aneurysm. Intra-arterial angiography confirmed a complete ipsilateral ICA thrombosis and a good arterial cross-flow from the left side to the bilateral anterior and middle cerebral artery territories. We started the patient on oral aspirin and a close clinicoradiologic follow-up after having decided against any active intervention.
   CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous thrombosis of an intracranial aneurysm and the parent artery is rare, with only a few cases reported in the literature. In the absence of symptoms and adequate collateral circulation, these patients are perhaps best managed conservatively.

ID NERVOUS-SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT; CLINICOPATHOLOGICAL ENTITY
AB BACKGROUND: Brain involvement of hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma (HSTL) has not been reported so far.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We observed an extremely rare case of HSTL, which is a rare and aggressive variant of peripheral T cell lymphoma, generally showing predominant infiltration to the liver, spleen, and bone marrow and involving the brain. A 41-year-old Japanese woman presented with dysarthria and numbness of the right hand. Radiologic examination revealed a single 3-cm mass in the left frontal cortex, which was totally removed. Pathologic examination of the specimen demonstrated T cell lymphoma with a gamma delta cytotoxic T cell phenotype. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction analyses confirmed monoclonality of T cell receptor gamma. Systemic examination revealed infiltration of atypical T lymphoid cells of the same phenotype in bone marrow and the presence of hepatosplenomegaly. We diagnosed HSTL involving the brain. The patient was treated with several courses of intensive chemotherapy, but it failed to achieve remission. She died of sepsis 4 months after the surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: HSTL can involve the brain. A diagnosis of HSTL involving the brain needs careful systemic evaluation. Timely and precise diagnosis that considers the systemic condition is important for appropriate treatment and better outcome.

AB BACKGROUND: Electromagnetic (EM) navigation has been reported to be a noninvasive and easy-to-use technique. However, the use of metal neurosurgical instruments (e.g., skin hooks, head frames, brain retractors systems) can interfere with the magnetic fields of such systems. We present the freehand technique, a new technique involving the manual manipulation of the emitter of an EM navigation system, which helps to prevent interference caused by metal instruments during surgery.
   METHODS: The AxiEM Electromagnetic StealthStation Navigation System (Medtronic) was used in this study. The emitter was placed in the sterilized surgical field, which allowed it to be moved freely during surgery. When navigation was necessary during the procedure, the assistant held the emitter at an appropriate angle to the sterile surgical field to avoid interference caused by the metal neurosurgical instruments.
   RESULTS: During surgery involving metal surgical instruments, all of the functions of the EM navigation system were available throughout the procedure. The accuracy of the navigation system was sufficient to allow craniotomy and intradural manipulation to be conducted.
   CONCLUSIONS: During the use of EM navigation systems, the freehand technique with the emitter can prevent interference caused by metal instruments.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to preliminarily explore the efficacy and safety of percutaneous endoscopic spinal surgery for epidural cement leakage. We report a case series of patients who underwent percutaneous retrieval of leaked epidural cement and achieved spinal decompression under endoscopy.
   METHODS: Five patients with neurologic impairment due to epidural cement leakage after percutaneous verte-broplasty were treated with percutaneous endoscopic spinal decompression. Computed tomography reconstruction and 3-dimensional imaging were used to evaluate the extruded material. During follow-up at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, all patients were advised to undergo plain radiograph and computed tomography examinations.
   RESULTS: The leaked epidural cement was successfully removed in all patients under percutaneous endoscopy through a unilateral or bilateral approach. At the 12-month follow-up, the visual analog scale score of all patients improved. In addition, the neurologic function of each patient improved to at least 1 grade level, as evaluated using the American Spinal Injury Association. According to the modified MacNab criteria, 2 patients had excellent recovery, whereas the other 3 patients had good recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS: We described a novel and minimally invasive procedure to ameliorate intractable epidural cement extrusion. As an alternative to conventional laminectomy, percutaneous endoscopic retrieval achieved the targeted decompression without damaging the posterior lamina. Moreover, the whole operation was performed under regional anesthesia accompanied with dexmedeto-midine sedation, allowed real-time neural function evaluation, and had lower risks of anesthesia-related complications, compared with general anesthesia.

DT Editorial Material
DE Microscopic cyst fenestration; Minimal invasive approaches; Neuroglial
   cysts; Supraorbital approach
AB Neuroglial cysts (also known as glioependymal cysts) are rare, benign, epithelial-lined cystic lesions that can potentially occur anywhere in the neuraxis. They can be intra, or within, a cranial nerve with the former being more common. The frontal lobe is thought to be the most common location. On magnetic resonance imaging, they follow cerebrospinal fluid signal and have smooth nonenhancing borders.
   This video demonstrates in a step-by-step fashion the technical nuances of the supraorbital keyhole approach through an eyebrow incision, for fenestration and biopsy of a neuroglial cyst within the left optic tract. The patient was a 27-year-old female who had peripheral vision disturbance postpartum. The cyst on magnetic resonance imaging was initially observed, but follow-up Humphrey visual field testing demonstrated worsening of the partial left superior quadrantanopsia. The keyhole supraorbital approach was selected to provide a direct route to the pathology with minimal soft tissue disruption.
   The patient was discharged on postoperative day 2 without any complications. Follow-up at 6 weeks demonstrated near-complete resolution of her quadrantanopsia and good cosmesis with no frontalis palsy.

AB BACKGROUND: Bone metastases from endometrial cancer are rare. To our knowledge, only 2 cases of solitary vertebral metastases from endometrial cancer presenting with osseous and/or neurologic symptoms before the diagnosis of the primary endometrial cancer have been reported; however, in both cases, the metastases were thoracic. Thus, cervical vertebral metastases are extremely rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe the case of a 55-year-old woman who presented with right C6 radicular and neck pain. Neurologic imaging showed destruction of the C6 vertebral body by an extradural mass with kyphotic changes in the cervical spine. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed increased uptake in the enlarged body of the uterus as well as the C6 vertebral body. Additional pelvic magnetic resonance images and endometrial biopsy confirmed endometrial cancer. The patient underwent excision of the cervical tumor with anterior reconstruction and posterior fixation followed 1 month later by semiradical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection. The cervical and endometrial histopathologic findings were similar, and the final diagnosis made was cervical metastatic adenocarcinoma originating from an endometrial cancer.
   CONCLUSIONS: We describe an extremely rare case of a precocious solitary cervical metastasis from an endometrial cancer presenting as cervical radicular pain. In our review of published reports, we found that solitary spinal metastases are significantly associated with longer overall survival than are multiple lesions. Resection of the spinal lesion with rigid spinal reconstruction followed by radical hysterectomy may be beneficial in such patients.

She denied any headaches or symptoms referable to the left eye region. Past medical history was significant for meningitis at 10 months of age. Family history was noncontributory with no history of brain tumors.
   CONCLUSIONS: A tumor originating from the left anterior clinoid was found intraoperatively and confirmed by histology to be a TGCT.

ID INVASIVE APPROACH; TUMORS; RESECTION
AB BACKGROUND: Schwannomas that involve the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve and localize exclusively in the parapharyngeal space (PPS) and infratemporal fossa (ITF) are extremely rare, and a surgical approach to treat such tumors has not been well established.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present our experience in the treatment of a giant trigeminal schwannoma with wide extension in the ITF and PPS using an endoscopic transvestibular transmandibular approach. The clinical and radiologic findings, preoperative planning, advantages of the surgical approach, and clinical outcome are discussed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Schwannomas located in the ITF and PPS are rare benign neoplasms. They are usually detected late after considerable signs and symptoms appear. Preoperative planning is beneficial to individual surgical approach selection. Total surgical excision following careful evaluation of preoperative computed tomography and magnetic resonance images is the treatment of choice. Recurrence is rare after complete excision.

   CHOREOATHETOSIS; HYPERINTENSITY; PUTAMEN; MRI
AB BACKGROUND: Hyperglycemic nonketotic chorea is an uncommon complication of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Patients typically develop abnormal signal changes in the striatum on imaging studies. Whereas the condition is well reported in the medical literature, reports on this topic in the surgical literature are lacking.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the first case of striatal hyperglycemic nonketotic signal changes occurring in the setting of a frontotemporal craniotomy for resection of a sphenoid wing meningioma. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the patient demonstrated restricted diffusion within the bilateral caudate nuclei, globus pallidus, putamen, and thalami in response to intraoperative hyperglycemia. Normalization of the patient's serum glucose levels postoperatively was followed by improvement in the radiographic abnormalities and their associated clinical sequelae. At the patient's last followup appointment 5 months after surgery, MRI demonstrated complete resolution of the abnormal signal changes to the patient's neurologic baseline.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although uncommon, striatal signal changes associated with nonketotic hyperglycemia should be recognized as a potential complication of surgery. Knowledge of this rare entity is important so that tight control of perioperative serum glucose can be achieved in diabetic patients to prevent this rare entity.

DT Article
DE Endoscopic lumbar discectomy; Interlaminar; PELD; Retract; Rotate
ID DISC HERNIATIONS
AB BACKGROUND: Interlaminar percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) is a minimally invasive technique to treat soft disc herniation. However, the currently used single working channel does not allow for safe nerve root retraction. This study aims to describe the rotate and retract technique for safe nerve root retraction during L5-S1 interlaminar PELD.
   METHODS: A total of 17 patients who underwent interlaminar PELD with the rotate and retract technique between November 2016 and August 2017 were retrospectively evaluated. Both pre- and postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores (back and leg) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were used for clinical assessment.
   RESULTS: The mean preoperative VAS scores for back and leg pain were 3.84 +/- 1.15 (range, 2-6) and 8.7 +/- 0.2 (range, 8-10), respectively. The mean preoperative ODI score was 64.2 +/- 13.2 (range, 48-90). The mean VAS scores for back and leg pain decreased to 1.24 +/- 1.34 (range, 0-6) and 1.15 +/- 0.65 (range, 0-4), respectively, at the last follow-up (P < 0.001). The mean ODI score also improved to 13.2 +/- 5.1 (range, 9-29) at the last follow-up (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: The rotate and retract technique for interlaminar PELD is an effective maneuver for the treatment of L5-S1 disc herniations in selected patients if performed by experienced surgeons.

   SURFACE ANATOMY; POSTERIOR ARCH
AB BACKGROUND: The arcuate foramen is an anatomic variant that is thought to arise from ossification of the posterior atlanto-occipital membrane. Owing to potential entrapment of the vertebral artery segment that traverses the foramen, vertebrobasilar ischemia may occur, and the person may experience vertigo, headache, or neck pain.
   METHODS: We reviewed the literature regarding anatomy (both human and comparative), embryology, nomenclature, pathology, and surgery of the arcuate foramen.
   RESULTS: Surgically, the presence of an arcuate foramen is important when placing screws into lateral masses of the atlas. In these cases, the screws can damage the V3 segment of the vertebral artery and/or the suboccipital nerve.
   CONCLUSIONS: It is important to review the current literature on the arcuate foramen to further understand its morphology and clinical relevance.

   ATHEROSCLEROSIS; DEVICE; DAMAGE; ASSOCIATION
AB BACKGROUND: Mechanical thrombectomy improves functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke. However, stent retrievers have the risk of vascular damage.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present 2 cases of patients with acute internal carotid artery occlusion who experienced removal of the intima by a stent retriever. In both patients, a 6 x 30-mm Solitaire stent was fully deployed from the M2 portion and slowly withdrawn. White membranes were retrieved outside the strut in both patients. Histopathologic examination showed that one membrane consisted of thickened intima and internal elastic lamina and the other consisted of calcified intima and internal elastic lamina. One patient who suffered embolic stroke experienced recurrent infarction within 24 hours after operation, and the damaged vessel was occluded on magnetic resonance angiography 21 days after stroke. In another patient with carotid artery dissection, the damaged vessel showed asymptomatic stenosis on magnetic resonance angiography 90 days after stroke. Arteries with both atherosclerosis and vessel dissection may be vulnerable to high radial expansion force.
   CONCLUSIONS: Full deployment of a relatively large-sized stent into a vulnerable vessel may cause vessel dissection after removal of the intima. Appropriate material selection and treatment strategy while considering stroke etiology and the occlusion site are important to prevent vessel damage.

DE Brainstem cavernous malformation; Cavernous malformation; Endoscopic;

ID ASSISTED BRAIN SURGERY; BASE SURGERY; MALFORMATIONS
AB BACKGROUND: Brainstem cavernous malformations represent around 8% - 22% of all intracranial cavernous malformations but exhibit a higher annual incidence of hemorrhage (2%-3%) compared with other cavernous angiomas and tend to be more symptomatic given their proximity to critical nuclei and fiber tracts. Recently, endoscopic endonasal techniques have been used for the removal of ventral skull base lesions, with significant improvement in operative morbidity and mortality compared with open approaches. Here we demonstrate the utility and feasibility of the endoscopic transclival approach for ventrally located pontine cavernomas in carefully selected patients.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Consent was provided by the patient before the writing of this report. Institutional review board approval was not necessary because there was no other patient data accessed. A 21-year-old man presented to the emergency department with right-sided hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated evidence of hemorrhage from a ventrally located pontine cavernoma. Given the ventral location of the lesion and the desire for early control of an associated developmental venous anomaly (DVA), an endoscopic endonasal transclival approach was chosen. Gross total resection was achieved, and the patient did well postoperatively with no new neurologic deficits or cerebrospinal fluid leak. He is currently routinely followed and is neurologically well.
   CONCLUSIONS: This approach provided direct visualization of the lesion and the associated DVA allowing for a gross total resection without injury to the DVA. The transclival approach may be considered as an alternative to open lateral and dorsolateral neurosurgical approaches for ventral brainstem cavernomas in carefully selected patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare transcallosal-transchoroidal and transcallosal-subchoroidal approaches to the ipsilateral and contralateral edges of the floor of the third ventricle using quantitative analyses.
   METHODS: Five formalin-fixed cadaveric human heads (10 sides) were examined under the operating microscope. Quantitative measurements (area of surgical freedom and angle of attack) were obtained using 3-T magnetic resonance imaging and a StealthStation image guidance system. The limits of the surgical approaches were shown by touching a probe to 6 designated points on the floor of the third ventricle.
   RESULTS: The transchoroidal approach provided greater surgical freedom than the subchoroidal approach to access ipsilateral and contralateral middle landmarks at the edges of the floor of the third ventricle in both longitudinal and horizontal planes (P <= 0.03). No significant difference between the 2 approaches was found in accessing the anterior and posterior landmarks of the third ventricle in each plane. The surgical freedom to the contralateral anterior, middle, and posterior landmarks was greater than to the ipsilateral landmarks in both the transchoroidal and subchoroidal approaches.
   CONCLUSIONS: The transcallosal-transchoroidal approach, compared with the transcallosal-subchoroidal approach, may provide better exposure and require less retraction for removal of ipsilateral or contralateral lesions located in the midbrain or hypothalamus and situated near the floor of the third ventricle. The contralateral transcallosal approach with either the transchoroidal or subchoroidal approach may provide good surgical freedom for removal of lesions located near the floor of the third ventricle, such as lesions in the midbrain.

AB We analyzed a total of 36 partial or complete mummies containing neural structures from Sharuna and Qarara (Middle Egypt) and Dra Abu-el Naga, West Thebes (Upper Egypt).
   Individual TT16 13.3-B06-Ind07 corresponded to a partial mummy from T2 to T11. At distal levels, it showed a structure compatible with the lower spinal cord (SC). Under magnification, the structure presented an absence of meningeal remains and a butterfly-like substructure resembling the anterior and posterior horns of the gray matter of the SC. Meanwhile, the central canal of the spinal cord (syrinx) was considerably enlarged. Field radiograph confirmed a structure compatible with the SC with a syrinx that shows a maximum diameter of 3.2 mm measured by digital caliper. Bearing in mind the normal shrinking mechanism at work in mummification, a pathologic condition such as syringomyelia during the individual's life is a distinct possibility. After a thorough review of the literature, this would be the earliest report of syringomyelia.

TI Filum Terminale Arteriovenous Fistulas with Multiple Shunt Points: A
   Report of Two Exceptional Cases
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Arteriovenous fistula; Filum terminale; FTAVF; Intraoperative
   angiography; Shunt point; Surgery
AB BACKGROUND: Filum terminale arteriovenous fistula (FTAVF) with multiple shunt points has not been reported in the literature. In previous studies, the angioarchitecture of FTAVFs was always featured with only one single shunt point, and such a uniformity had established the preconceived and conventional understanding of FTAVFs for clinicians.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The authors describe 2 exceptional cases of FTAVFs with multiple shunt points confirmed by open surgery, which means that the above understanding may lead to misdiagnosis and incomplete treatment in future. The surgery of both cases was performed in a hybrid operating room, and all of shunt points were obliterated with the help of intraoperative digital subtraction angiography.
   CONCLUSIONS: The exceptional finding of these 2 cases is a renewal of the conventional understanding of FTAVFs, not only for the angioarchitecture of the lesions but also for the treatment strategy.

TI Interval Recovery of Syringomyelia in Chiari I Malformation Patient with
   Acute Cervical Trauma After Anterior Decompression: Case Report and
   Review of Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Anterior decompression; Chiari malformation; Spinal trauma;
   Syringomyelia
ID POSTTRAUMATIC SYRINGOMYELIA; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; PREDICTORS; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Syringomyelia in the cervical spinal cord is a complex pathology that is commonly associated with Chiari I malformation or spinal cord trauma. In both cases the development of syringomyelia has been linked to multiple anatomic and molecular elements including epidural compression. Literature has mainly reported posterior cervical decompressive procedures or shunting of the cyst as options to address this pathology. Anterior decompression is rarely recommended.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a 19-year-old female who suffered a motor vehicle accident causing a cervical subluxation with mild newonset neurologic deficits. Preoperative workup showed a large incidental cervical syringomyelia associated with a Chiari I malformation. Anterior cervical decompression at the subluxated cervical segment with a concomitant anterior and posterior fusion was performed. Postoperative workup revealed a significant interval reduction in the size of the syrinx cavity with concomitant neurologic improvement.
   CONCLUSIONS: Anterior decompression may be considered as an option in select cases of syringomyelia. The findings of this case support the theory of epidural compression as one of the inciting events for the development of syringomyelia.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to study the application of precise intraoperative localization of small intramedullary spinal cord tumors.
   METHODS: From November 2015 to August 2017, 5 patients with small intramedullary spinal cord tumors were arranged in this group. By using the O-arm image system, we acquired the intraoperative computed tomography images of all patients and sent them to the Stealth navigation system. Medtronic Synergy Cranial software was used to complete the image fusion with preoperative magnetic resonance images, and the fused images were used to localize the intramedullary spinal cord tumors by the navigation system. The navigation errors were evaluated by measuring the maximum distance between the end of the tumor in sagittal magnetic resonance imaging and its real position.
   RESULTS: Five patients accomplished the multimodal image fusion, and we successfully completed the image-guided surgeries. The mean diameter of tumors was 12.2 +/- 3.1 mm in sagittal magnetic resonance imaging, and the mean incision length was 12.7 +/- 3.3 mm. The time of image processing was between 13 minutes and 17 minutes, and the mean value was 15 +/- 1.6 minutes. The navigation error was between 0.9 mm and 1.5 mm, and the mean value was 1.2 +/- 0.2 mm.
   CONCLUSIONS: The application of the multimodal image fusion combined with intraoperative O-arm image navigation system can be used to localize small intramedullary tumors.

   INFECTION
AB BACKGROUND: Cervical spondylodiscitis with spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is not a rare medical condition and usually requires urgent decompression of neural structures and stabilization of the spine followed by antibiotic therapy for the prevention of severe neurologic deficits.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In this report, we present a 43-year-old male patient with the chief complaint of neck pain and intermittent fever accompanying by slight dysphagia. After 2 weeks, he felt mild and transient numbness on the left upper limb. He had a history of esophageal intervention under endoscopy. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed diffuse hyperintensity in the left paraesophageal and prevertebral tissues and a space-occupying lesion within the spinal canal. The esophagography revealed a saclike barium collection parallel to the upper esophagus herniating out from the posterior wall without evident leakage. Neither surgical decompression nor drainage was chosen by this patient; conservative treatment with antibiotic administration was managed to achieve a good neurologic recovery and remarkable resolution of the epidural abscess. During antibiotic therapy and dietary restriction, the symptoms of diverticulitis was also managed expectantly.
   CONCLUSIONS: Physicians need to be aware of this rare case of SEA secondary to esophageal diverticulitis. An early diagnosis and prompt administration of antibiotics is a key factor to avoid neurologic deterioration for the treatment of SEA caused by diverticulitis. Endoscopic or surgical repair of diverticulum may be warranted to avoid the recurrence of such infection.

AB BACKGROUND: Pial arteriovenous fistulas (PAVFs) are rare vascular malformations, especially in neonates. The purpose of this report is to discuss the treatment strategy and its associated challenges. We present a case of prenatal intracranial PAVF treated by endovascular embolization in the neonatal period.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was born through Cesarean delivery and then treated twice using transarterial embolization with detachable platinum coils and n-butyl cyanoacrylate due to intractable heart failure. Even though angiography findings showed dramatical reduction in the shunt, the patient did not recover from heart failure and died at day 49 after birth.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite current developments in medical technology and therapies, the effective treatment of critical PAVFs still poses a challenge. Therefore, more indications and effective alternative treatments must be discussed.

   Mimicking Cavernous Dural Arteriovenous Fistula
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Exophthalmos; Intracranial venous hypertension; Superior vena cava
   syndrome
ID COMPLICATIONS; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Known facts are that a long period of central catheterization or hemodialysis causes central venous occlusion or stenosis and its further development brings about superior vena cava syndrome. Major symptoms of superior vena cava syndrome include venous congestion caused by the occlusion or stenosis of the central vein in the sites of the head, face, neck, and upper extremity. Clinical manifestations of superior vena cava syndrome are less likely to cause intracranial hypertension, and intracranial venous hypertension does not appear to be a clinical symptom of cavernous sinus-dural arteriovenous fistula.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 35-year-old female patient visited our hospital with chief complaints of a 2-week-old headache, chemosis, pulsatile and exophthalmos and the deteriorating ptosis in the right eye. The patient has been on continuous hemodialysis since diagnosis of renal failure due to diabetes for 20 years. Magnetic resonance images led us to a strong suspicion of cavernous sinus-dural arteriovenous fistula. However, an additionally performed digital subtraction angiogram led us to the diagnosis of superior vena cava syndrome of severe stenosis in both brachiocephalic veins. Balloon angioplasty was performed to the narrowed right-side brachiocephalic vein. No more intracranial venous reflux was to be seen in the postballoon angiogram.
   CONCLUSIONS: In our case, the clinical manifestations of superior vena cava syndrome seemed to be cavernous sinus-dural arteriovenous fistula and symptoms disappeared when resolving central vein stenosis. We report a case of superior vena cava syndrome with atypical clinical features.

AB BACKGROUND: Difficulties are associated with the diagnosis and management of patients with coma because of intracranial hypotension.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 70-year-old man with coma (Glasgow Coma Scale score of 6) with fixed dilated pupils because of severe intracranial hypotension is described. After unsuccessful epidural blood patch (EBP), the patient underwent microsurgical dural repair and drainage of hematoma with intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. Intraoperatively, a dural tear associated with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak was identified at the thoracolumbar junction ventral to the spinal cord. The dural tear was repaired using posterior laminoplasty with a transdural approach without spinal fixation. Immediately after surgery, ICP was low, but it recovered to a physiologic range in 4 hours. Consciousness level favorably improved in a week, and the patient has remained stable for 1.5 years with good quality of life without recurrence.
   CONCLUSIONS: The patient represents the first described case, to our knowledge, of intracranial hypotension with coma because of a CSF leak caused by a spinal ventral dural tear. In the setting of failed EBP attempt, our technique may be a treatment option for severe intracranial hypotension.

AB BACKGROUND: Primary intracranial chondrosarcoma is an extremely rare malignant tumor of the central nervous system, which accounts for < 0.16% of all primary intracranial tumors. This rare tumor has a high associated morbidity from the tumor itself as well as from treatment modalities.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 33-year-old man presented with a diffuse headache of 3 months' duration. He was admitted to our department with weakness in the right extremities that had persisted for more than a month. Findings of the neurologic examination revealed right hemiparesis. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a well-demarcated, parasagittal left frontal mass, which compressed to the lateral ventricle. It was hypointense on T1-weighted and hyperintense on T2-weighted images without creating edema in the surrounding tissue. A left frontoparietal craniotomy with complete excision of the mass was performed. The postoperative period was uneventful, and patient was discharged on the fourth postoperative day without any neurologic deficit. Histopathology showed a morphology that was in favor of chondrosarcoma grade 1.
   CONCLUSIONS: Dural chondrosarcoma is a possible entity in the differential diagnosis of a presumed meningioma, particularly when atypical features are present. We report a grade 1 intracranial chondrosarcoma of the classical subtype without any neurologic problems after complete surgical excision. The patient did not receive any adjuvant therapy and at 26 months' follow-up showed no recurrence.

AB BACKGROUND: Bow hunter's syndrome (BHS) or rotational vertebral artery occlusion is a rare syndrome of vertebrobasilar insufficiency due to compression or occlusion of the contralateral vertebral artery with cervical axial rotation. Compression at the C2-C3 level, the junction between the axial and subaxial spine, has not been described. Management can include medical treatment with antiplatelet medications, surgical fusion, or vertebral artery decompression. CASE
   DESCRIPTION: The patient presented with dizziness and loss of consciousness with axial head rotation to the left. Dynamic digital subtraction angiography revealed occlusion of the right vertebral artery with the head turning to the left, with concurrent symptom onset. The left vertebral artery largely ended in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. The patient underwent C2-C3 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion without vertebral artery decompression. His postoperative course was uneventful, with complete symptom resolution. Follow-up dynamic angiography demonstrated a patent right vertebral artery with axial head rotation to the left.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case report demonstrates that even high cervical etiology for BHS can be successfully managed from an anterior approach. At present, no consensus has been reached for the treatment of BHS. A review of the current data demonstrated that anterior approaches without decompression are slightly safer than posterior approaches, with a smaller risk of vertebral artery injury. Depending on the anatomic variant and the pathophysiology of vertebral compression, an anterior approach without decompression provides a feasible alternative for the treatment of symptomatic BHS.

TI Bow Hunter's Syndrome: Surgical Vertebral Artery Decompression Guided by

ID OF-THE-LITERATURE; ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; CERVICAL SPONDYLOSIS;
   ULTRASONOGRAPHY; DOPPLER; STROKE
AB BACKGROUND: Bow hunter's syndrome is a symptomatic vertebrobasilar insufficiency resulting from a rotational stenosis or occlusion of a dominant vertebral artery (VA). The VA is dynamically compressed by cervical osteoarthritis (discovertebral structure or osteophytes) during head rotation or neck extension. Diagnosis is based on dynamic computed tomography angiography and confirmed with dynamic catheter angiography. Surgery tends to be the best treatment option in most cases. Dynamic intraoperative assessment of VA decompression seems to improve surgical results but remains poorly evaluated in the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 70-year-old man with bow hunter's syndrome related to left VA compression by C3-4 osteophyte protrusion presented with syncopal episodes during left head rotation. Bow hunter's syndrome was successfully managed with an anterior transuncal surgical decompression of the left VA and C3-4 fusion. Surgical decompression was guided by dynamic intraoperative catheter angiography and secured with an intra-arterial remodeling balloon placed just before surgery. The patient was symptom-free after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical decompression guided by dynamic intraoperative catheter angiography leads to selective VA release and allows real-time assessment of the efficacy of the decompression. This multidisciplinary treatment involving neurosurgical and neuroradiologic teams is a simple and effective treatment. Dynamic intraoperative catheter angiography is an essential guide to perform selective decompression of the VA, and implementation of an intra-arterial remodeling balloon can improve the safety of surgery making this method valuable compared with other intraoperative assessment techniques, such as Doppler ultrasound and indocyanine green fluorescent videography.

LA English

DE Enterogenous cyst; Intestinoma; Spinal anomalies; Spinal cyst; Spinal
   neuroenteric cyst
ID INTRACRANIAL NEURENTERIC CYSTS; NEURAL-TUBE; ANOMALIES
AB BACKGROUND: Neuroenteric cysts are rare developmental anomalies of the central nervous system that account for approximately 0.7%-1.3% of all spinal cord lesions. The majority of spinal neuroenteric cysts are located ventral to the spinal cord. Dorsally located neuroenteric cysts are rare and are almost always associated with other spinal anomalies. Isolated dorsal spinal neuroenteric cysts, without other associated spinal anomalies, are extremely rare. These lesions can be mistaken for the more commonly encountered spinal cysts (e.g., arachnoid cysts, ependymal cysts, cystic teratomas).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the first pediatric case of a 9-month-old boy with an isolated dorsal thoracic neuroenteric cyst and cord compression that underwent surgical resection. The patient tolerated the procedure well and remained neurologically stable after surgery. Pathology was consistent with a neuroenteric cyst. Complete resection was not achieved at the time of surgery. In retrospect, knowing the lesion is a neuroenteric cyst, a more aggressive approach aiming for a complete surgical resection should have been undertaken. To our knowledge, only 2 adult cases of isolated dorsal spinal neuroenteric cysts have been reported in the literature.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neuroenteric cysts can occur dorsal to the spinal cord without any associated spinal anomalies. The gold standard treatment for neuroenteric cysts is surgical resection, and the goal of surgery is complete resection.

ID OF-THE-LITERATURE
AB BACKGROUND: Chiari III malformation is an extremely rare congenital anomaly. At present, its primary and associated pathognomonic factors remain poorly understood. The authors report a case of a male neonate born with an occipital encephalocoele with herniation of posterior fossa contents associated with bilateral postaxial polydactyly.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient is a dichorionic, diamniotic twin conceived via assisted reproductive methods; his twin sister has no congenital anomaly. Neurosurgical management included successful repair of the encephalocoele and subsequent cerebrospinal fluid diversion via a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
   CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the uniqueness of this patient's presentation, the concurrent diagnoses of Chiari III malformation and polydactyly are discussed in concordance with updated literature.

   PATIENT; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Osmotic demyelination syndrome commonly follows rapid correction of hyponatremia. Although pons is a common location, extrapontine locations, such as striatum and thalamus, have been reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 48-year-old woman presented with masked facies, shuffling gait, and pill-rolling tremors suggestive of acute-onset parkinsonism. Hyponatremia was diagnosed following a bout of diarrhea, which was corrected with hypertonic saline. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a giant pituitary adenoma. Hyperintensities on T2-weighted imaging were also seen at the level of pons and bilateral striatum. Central pontine myelinolysis and extrapontine myelinolysis were diagnosed. Hormonal assay showed hypocortisolism, secondary hypothyroidism, and hypogonadism. The patient was started on levodopa-carbidopa, steroids, and thyroxine. She underwent transnasal pituitary adenoma excision. At 6 months postoperatively, she had recovered completely with normal gait. Repeat imaging showed complete resolution of myelinolysis. At 36 months, she continued to have hypocortisolism and hypothyroidism requiring replacement.
   CONCLUSIONS: Extrapontine myelinolysis with parkinsonism and asymptomatic central pontine myelinolysis is rare with few cases described in the literature. Our patient had a pituitary adenoma with hyponatremia requiring sodium correction, and we believe that hypopituitarism might have predisposed her to osmotic demyelination. We reviewed relevant literature on extrapontine myelinolysis in suprasellar tumors and the pathophysiology. Hypopituitarism is an underrecognized cause of hyponatremia. When treating a patient with hyponatremia, knowing the pituitary function status is a prerequisite for the physician to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome.

AB BACKGROUND: Severe complications after reperfusion therapy for acute major vessel occlusion are not well described. We present an extremely rare case of a patient with rapid malignant brain swelling subacutely after acute ischemic stroke.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 84-year-old man underwent reperfusion therapy for acute left internal carotid artery occlusion; complete reperfusion was achieved. Although magnetic resonance imaging on postoperative day 1 revealed a small hemorrhagic infarction and subarachnoid hemorrhage unrelated to a left middle cerebral artery aneurysm in the left frontal lobe, neurologic deficits resolved completely. On postoperative day 5, the patient developed a fever and sudden disorder of consciousness with right hemiparesis. Urosepsis was diagnosed, and computed tomography revealed massive hemorrhagic infarction in the left frontal lobe and diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage. Emergent hematoma evacuation and clipping were performed. Although the aneurysm was unruptured, brain swelling was severe despite a patent middle cerebral artery. Computed tomography performed immediately postoperatively (within 6 hours after pre-operative computed tomography) showed severe left brain swelling with midline shift. The patient died on postoperative day 15.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case has similarities to both second-impact syndrome after head trauma and perfusion breakthrough phenomenon. Initial ischemic damage following reperfusion therapy and damage secondary to sepsis and subarachnoid hemorrhage may have led to rapid malignant brain swelling in this patient. Careful management is important for patients receiving reperfusion therapy.

AB BACKGROUND: Chordomas are locally aggressive tumors that can involve multiple levels of the spine and are difficult to resect. We present our technique for 4-level en bloc cervical spondylectomy for a locally aggressive chordoma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 37-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of dysphagia and a large indurated cervical mass. Imaging showed an enhancing lesion involving C3-6. Needle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of chordoma. En bloc resection was chosen to maximize her chances of disease-free survival. A 360 degrees approach was deemed necessary. We posteriorly disconnected the vertebral bodies and skeletonized the bilateral vertebral arteries and nerve roots. The interspinous and yellow ligaments and the spinous processes were spared to maintain a solid posterior tension band, as previously described approaches that had sacrificed these elements had a high rate of instrumentation failure. After posterior instrumentation, a wide anterior approach enabled us to resect the tumor attached to the vertebral bodies of C3-6 as 1 specimen. A 4-level corpectomy cage and plate were used for anterior instrumentation. The patient tolerated the surgery well. She needed a temporary gastrostomy, and she had a right C5 palsy that progressively recovered. Follow-up imaging showed no tumor recurrence and good bony fusion.
   CONCLUSIONS: En bloc resection as part of a multidisciplinary team approach remains the mainstay of spinal chordoma treatment. Modern instrumentation and careful dissection can provide good results even in locally advanced cases.

   Report and Literature Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Chiari type I malformation; Decompressive surgery; Intractable hiccups
ID MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: The authors report the case of a 34-year-old man who presented with intractable hiccups. The imaging examination showed that the patient was suffering from syringomyelia associated with Chiari type I malformation.
   CASE DESCRIPTIONS: The patient underwent posterior fossa decompression combined with bilateral tonsillectomy and duroplasty. The intractable hiccups completely resolved 1 week after operation and had not recurred at 2 months after surgery. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging showed the atrophy of the tonsils of the cerebellum and disappearance of the cavities of the spinal cord.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intractable hiccups as the main symptoms of Chiari type I malformation are extremely rare in the clinic. Decompression surgery should be an appropriate method to relieve the symptoms.

DE Awake craniotomy; Global health; Surgical education; Surgical mission;
   Sustainability
ID BRAIN-TUMOR SURGERY; NEUROSURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the sustainability of teaching awake craniotomy in Indonesia. We explored the factors affecting how awake craniotomy can be taught in a low- to middle-income (LMIC) country and the factors affecting the utilization of awake craniotomy in Indonesia.
   METHODS: This is a prospective mixed-methods study in Indonesia. A questionnaire was administered to 100 neurosurgeons at a conference on their experience with neuro-oncology, awake craniotomy, and teaching missions. Thirty-three physicians participated in semi-structured interviews elaborating on these topics. Data on tumor caseload and resources were collected.
   RESULTS: Thirty-three of 88 respondents (41.3%) indicated that they still perform awake craniotomy. Although 87.3% felt that it was beneficial for patients and resource sparing, less than a quarter of them felt they had sufficient exposure/training in awake craniotomy. Almost all of them wanted further training and to maintain a relationship with international mentors. Four themes emerged about the factors that affect how we teach awake craniotomy in an LMIC: 1) the sustainability of a teaching mission is dependent on a culture of information sharing and 2) the support of multiple health care providers; 3) hospital structure affects how changes are implemented; and 4) health care professionals in Indonesia value opportunities for international training. Regarding the uptake of awake craniotomy in Indonesia, there are sociocultural factors that affect patients' receptiveness to surgery and the national insurance plan restricts the provision of neurosurgical care.
   CONCLUSIONS: Many factors need to be explored when planning a neurosurgical mission in LMICs to ensure its sustainability.

AB The history of neurosurgery is ever fascinating. The journey has been tedious; nevertheless, in the landscape of success and failures we have become more efficient and polished. Skills were learned, innovations were made, and in the process we evolved. The immense contribution of meningioma surgery in this maturation process is attested by history itself. Countless stories that testify the momentous role of meningioma in the process of evolution and reformation of neurosurgical techniques exist in the literature. With every step and every attempt at conquering this tumor, we reformed to be better surgeons, more skilled and more precise. In this paper we have walked down the lane of neurosurgery and paid a due tribute to this "necessary evil."

AB The nondominant hemisphere (usually the right) is responsible for primary cognitive functions such as visuospatial and social cognition. Awake surgery using direct electric stimulation for right cerebral tumor removal remains challenging because of the complexity of the functional anatomy and difficulties in adapting standard bedside tasks to awake surgery conditions. An understanding of semiology and anatomic bases, along with an analysis of the available cognitive tasks for visuospatial and social cognition per operative mapping allow neurosurgeons to better appreciate the functional anatomy of the right hemisphere and its relevance to tumor surgery. In this article, the first of a 2-part review, we discuss the anatomic and functional basis of right hemisphere function. Whereas part II of the review focuses primarily on semiology and surgical management of right-sided tumors under awake conditions, this article provides a comprehensive review of knowledge underpinning awake surgery on the right hemisphere.

TI Effectiveness of Dural Sealants in Prevention of Cerebrospinal Fluid
   Leakage After Craniotomy: A Systematic Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Review
DE Cerebrospinal fluid leakage; Cranial surgery; Dura mater; Dural sealant
ID PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; FIBRIN SEALANT; HYDROGEL SEALANT; CLOSURE;
   SAFETY; AUGMENTATION; REPAIR; RISK; DURASEAL; EFFICACY
AB OBJECTIVE: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage is one of the most challenging complications in neurosurgery. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of dural sealants in preventing CSF leakage after cranial surgery.
   METHODS: A literature search was performed in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. The inclusion criteria were defined to include articles describing regular cranial procedures combined with the use of any dural sealant reporting CSF leakage. The primary outcome was CSF leakage (pseudomeningocele formation or incisional CSF leakage), secondary outcomes were pseudomeningocele formation, incisional CSF leakage, and surgical-site infection.
   RESULTS: Twenty articles were included. Ten of these were comparative studies (sealant vs. no sealant) including 3 randomized controlled trials. In the 20 articles, a total of 3682 surgical procedures were reported. The number of CSF leakages in general did not differ between the sealant group (8.2%) and control group (8.4%), risk ratio (RR) 0.84 (0.50-1.42), I-2 =56%. Exclusion of nonrandomized controlled trials did not alter the results. Meta-analyses for secondary outcomes showed no difference between number of incisional CSF leakage, RR 0.30 (0.05-1.59), I-2 =38%. Also, no difference was found in the pseudomeningocele formation, RR 1.50 (0.43-5.17), I-2 =0%. Surgical-site infection was seen less in the sealant group (1.0%) compared with the control group (5.6%), RR 0.25 (0.13-0.48), I-2 =0%.
   CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review showed that dural sealants did not reduce the number of CSF leaks in general, the number of incisional CSF leaks alone, or the number of pseudomeningocele formations alone. However, dural sealants reduced the risk of surgical-site infection.

AB BACKGROUND: The decompressive hemicraniectomy operation is highly effective in relieving refractory intracranial hypertension. However, one limitation of this treatment strategy is the requirement to perform a subsequent cranioplasty operation to reconstruct the skull defect-an expensive procedure with high complication rates. An implant that is capable of accommodated post-hemicraniectomy brain swelling, but also provides acceptable skull defect coverage after brain swelling abates, would theoretically eliminate the need for the cranioplasty operation. In an earlier report, the concept of using a thin, moveable plate implant for this purpose was introduced.
   METHODS: Measurements were obtained in a series of stroke patients to determine whether a plate offset from the skull by 5 mm would accommodate the observed post-hemicraniectomy brain swelling. The volume of brain swelling measured in all patients in the stroke series would be accommodated by a 5-mm offset plate. In the current report, we expanded our analysis to study brain swelling patterns in a different population of patients requiring a hemicraniectomy operation: those with traumatic brain injuries (TBI).
   RESULTS: We identified 56 patients with TBI and measured their postoperative brain herniation volumes. A moveable plate offset by 5 mm would create sufficient additional volume to accommodate the brain swelling measured in all but one patient. That patient had malignant intraoperative brain swelling and died the following day.
   CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that a 5 mm offset plate will provide sufficient volume for brain expansion for almost all hemicraniectomy operations.

TI Rate of Craniotomy Fusion After Free Bone Flap
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Craniotomy; Free flap; Fusion rate
ID TECHNICAL NOTE; FIXATION; RELIABILITY
AB BACKGROUND: Craniotomy has been performed in neurologic surgery for over a century. Replacement of free bone flaps in routine craniotomies is widely practiced, however, the rate of fusion after free flap replacement is unknown.
   OBJECTIVE: To assess timing and rate of fusion after routine craniotomies.
   METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 2200 patients who underwent craniotomies from 2002 to 2005. Fusion rates and time to fusion were evaluated. When time to fusion was taken into consideration, univariate and multivariate analyses of the impact of clinical factors on fusion rate were also examined.
   RESULTS: Of 171 patients with postoperative computed tomography of over 2200 patients undergoing craniotomy, 103 (60%) demonstrated solid fusion, 26 (15%) had probable fusion, and 42 (25%) had not achieved fusion. There were no significant differences when fusion was compared with demographics such as age, sex, body mass index, and history of tobacco use. Radiation therapy had a significant impact on fusion: those receiving radiation were less likely to achieve fusion (P = 0.0082). The fusion rates at 12, 24, and 36 months after surgery were 15%, 41%, and 54%, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: As expected, craniotomy fusion rates after free flap replacement increased steadily over time. We were not able to demonstrate that clinical factors such as age, sex, body mass index, diagnosis, fixation material, and radiation had an impact on fusion rate when time to fusion was accounted for. Patients receiving radiation, however, experienced fusion less frequently. Because of the scarcity of previous studies in this area, this current study serves as a platform for future studies on fusion rates after free flap replacement.

   IMMOBILIZATION; MORBIDITY; OUTCOMES; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Odontoid fractures are the most common acute cervical spinal fractures in the geriatric population. Their rate is increasing along with the rising age of the elderly population. Whereas conservative management with external immobilization is reported as the treatment of choice for type I and III odontoid fractures, there are no clear indications concerning the best treatment for type II fractures. In younger patients surgical management is considered the best choice, but in older adults the rate of good outcomes worsens and operative risk because of comorbidities increases.
   METHODS: We report our retrospective single-center experience with conservative treatment of type II odontoid fractures in an elderly population, focusing on both radiologic and functional outcomes to compare our results with the recent literature.
   RESULTS: Among the 21 selected subjects with aminimum follow-up of 18 months, 19 (90.5%) showed a satisfactory clinical outcome, with an adequate bony healing in 10 cases and nonsymptomatic pseudarthrosis in 9 patients. All these patients were satisfied with the conservative results and could stop use of the collar. Two patients (9.5%) did not show any improvement and had to keep the collar indefinitely.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study was limited because it was a retrospective review, with a limited number of patients. Nevertheless, the clinical and radiologic outcomes of our patients differ from the results of other studies, suggesting that conservative management of these fractures in this population does not necessarily lead to a bad clinical outcome or delayed surgery.

   DIAGNOSIS
AB INTRODUCTION: Infectious intracranial aneurysms (IIAs) are a rare but potentially devastating complication of infective endocarditis. The clinical and radiographic findings that predispose patients to IIA remain poorly understood.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of consecutive endocarditis patients undergoing catheter-based angiography at a single tertiary-level academic center during the period of July 2013-December 2017. Patient records were reviewed for clinical and radiographic characteristics that may be associated with IIA. Multivariate regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between clinical and radiographic characteristics and presence of IIA on invasive imaging.
   RESULTS: Of 92 patients included in this analysis, 12 of them with 19 IIAs were discovered. Univariate analysis identified age, male sex, presence of hemorrhage, and history of IV drug use (IVDU) as predictors of IIA presence. After multivariate analysis, only intracranial hemorrhage and IVDU remained as independent predictors of IIA.
   CONCLUSIONS: Presence of hemorrhage on noninvasive imaging and history of IVDU are independently predictive of IIA presence in patients with infectious endocarditis. Risk stratification using these 2 factors may help identify the most vulnerable populations for IIA formation.

   BLOOD-FLOW; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; VENTRICULOJUGULAR SHUNT; DIRECTION
AB BACKGROUND: Since the 1950s, hydrocephalus has been be treated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts, usually to the peritoneal cavity or to the right cardiac atrium. However, because of their siphoning effect, these shunts lead to nonphysiologic CSF drainage, with possible comorbidity and high revision rates. More sophisticated shunt valve systems significantly increase costs and technical complexity and remain unsuccessful in a subgroup of patients. In an attempt to obtain physiologic CSF shunting, many neurosurgical pioneers shunted towards the dural sinuses, taking advantage of the physiologic antisiphoning effect of the internal jugular veins. Despite several promising reports, the ventriculosinus shunts have not yet become standard neurosurgical practice.
   METHODS: In this single-center prospective clinical study, we implanted the retrograde ventriculosinus shunt, as advocated by EI-Shafei, in 10 patients. This article reports on our operation technique and long-term outcome, including 4 patients in whom this shunt was implanted as a rescue operation.
   RESULTS: Implantation of a ventriculosinus shunt proved to be feasible, warranting physiologic drainage of CSF. However, in only 3 of 14 patients, functionality of the retrograde ventriculosinus shunt was maintained during more than 6 years of follow-up. In our opinion, these shunts fail because present venous access devices are difficult to implant correctly and become too easily obstructed. After discussion of possible causes of this frequent obstruction, a new dural venous sinus access device is presented.
   CONCLUSION: An easy-to-implant and thrombogenic-resistant dural venous sinus access device needs to be developed before ventriculosinus shunting can become general practice.

AB BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), is an excellent tool for diagnosing intracranial infection, with limitations in previous neurosurgical intervention. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of DWI in the diagnosis of postoperative intracranial infection.
   METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated all consecutive patients with intracranial infection undergoing a neurosurgical intervention who had preoperative MRI, including DWI. Patients were divided into 2 groups: spontaneous intracranial infection (SI) and postoperative intracranial infection (PI). A control group (CG) of patients who had undergone brain surgery without any signs of subsequent infection was also included. Qualitatively, MRI data were evaluated for the presence of intracranial infection. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for PI as opposed to no infection were determined. Quantitatively, areas with diffusion restriction within the surgery/abscess cavity were identified for the 3 groups using semiautomated segmentation. Group differences regarding apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) ratios were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to identify a point in time beyond which ADC ratios might show reasonable discriminatory power between the PI and CG groups.
   RESULTS: A total of 78 patients were included (38 in the SI group, 20 in the PI group, 20 in the CG group). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values in the diagnosis of PI were 80%, 95%, 4%, and 100%, respectively. Median ADC was significantly higher in the PI group compared with the SI group (0.98 vs. 0.69; P < 0.001) but lower compared with the CG group (1.24; P = 0.16). The analysis suggested a possible differentiation of PI and CG after a time interval of approximately 100 days/3 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: DWI is of limited value in evaluating postoperative brain infection. Our data show a trend toward DWI regaining its validity at approximately 3 months after surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: Flow diversion has become an accepted treatment strategy for aneurysms; however, there are limited data on the use of these devices in small vessels <= 2.5 mm in diameter.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of our prospectively maintained database to identify all patients treated with flow diversion between September 2009 and January 2018. We identified all patients in whom the average parent artery was <= 2.5 mm in diameter. Ruptured aneurysms were excluded from the analysis as were patients who had adjunctive coiling at the time of flow diversion.
   RESULTS: We identified 29 patients (22 female, 76%) with average age 56.2 +/- 15.9 years (range, 21-83 years). Most aneurysms were classified as saccular (n = 21, 72.4%), with 7 fusiform aneurysms (24.2%) and 1 presumed dissecting aneurysm (3.4%). The average parent artery diameter was 2.1 +/- 0.37 mm (range, 1.3-2.5 mm). Delayed angiographic follow-up was available for 18 patients at an average of 19.4 months after treatment. Fifteen patients showed Raymond-Roy classification grade 1 occlusion (94%) and 1 patient with complete filling showed Raymond-Roy classification grade 3 (6%). Four patients (13.7%) underwent repeat treatment with implantation of another flow-diverting stent in a telescoping manner. At 90 days, 2 patients had a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 6, 1 from an unrelated cause and 1 from the enlarging compressive dissecting aneurysm and intraparenchymal hemorrhage. All the remaining patients had an mRS score <= 2 at 90 days, with 24 patients (83%) with an mRS score of 0.
   CONCLUSIONS: Flow diverters can be implanted into small vessels with a high rate of technical success and good rates of aneurysm occlusion. Dedicated devices to target these vessels should be developed.

AB OBJECTIVE: To relate the experiences of a pediatric surgery clinic in diagnosis and treatment of abdominal complications related to ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPSs) in pediatric patients who had VPSs implanted to treat hydrocephalus.
   METHODS: Patients admitted to the Pediatric Surgery Department of Van Yuzunciyil University Faculty of Medicine between April 2013 and December 2017 who had VPSs implanted and subsequently developed abdominal complications were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic information, surgery dates, time intervals between surgery and development of abdominal complication, complication types and applied treatments, and follow-up durations were recorded.
   RESULTS: There were 16 patients (6 girls, 10 boys) with a mean age of 3 years (range, 1 month to 8 years) reviewed. Complications following VPS implantation included abdominal pseudocyst, anal protrusion, volvulus, peritonitis, abdominal distention, and herniation. Complications were treated successfully with contemporary surgical methods. No issues during long-term postoperative follow-up were identified.
   CONCLUSIONS: VPS implantation can result in abdominal complications with a wide range of clinical presentations. Predicting which abdominal complications might occur in children with VPSs can be lifesaving with early diagnosis and treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: Supratentorial extraventricular ependymoma (STEE) is an extremely rare central nervous system (CNS) neoplasm, the clinical characteristics and optimal treatment of which remain unclear. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of 15 patients with STEE.
   METHODS: Fifteen patients with STEE were identified, and their clinical, radiologic, and surgical records were reviewed.
   RESULTS: The 15 patients included 6 males (40%) and 9 females (60%), with a median age of 15 years. Nine patients (60%) underwent gross total resection, 5 patients (33.3%) underwent subtotal resection, and 1 patient (6.7%) underwent biopsy. Eight patients received adjuvant radiotherapy, and 3 received adjuvant chemotherapy. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of patients with World Health Organization (WHO) grade II and grade III STEE were 100% and 30%, respectively, and the corresponding 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 77.8% and 20%. The differences in OS and PFS rates between WHO grades II and III STEE were statistically significant (P < 0.01 and 0.02, respectively). Anaplastic histology (WHO grade III) was a poor prognostic factor for PFS (P = 0.04). The recurrence pattern was local recurrence in all patients; all cases were treated primarily by redo surgery. Three patients with recurrent WHO grade II STEE were alive at more than 64, 52, and 44 months after redo surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: STEE is an extremely rare CNS neoplasm. The histological grade of STEE is an important prognostic factor. Microsurgical resection might play a major role in both initial treatment and treatment of recurrent tumors.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of pedicle screw with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) augmentation in unilateral transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (uTLIF) in osteoporotic patients.
   METHODS: We randomly divided 50 osteoporotic patients with degenerative lumbar diseases diagnosed between February 2014 and November 2015 into 2 groups. One group underwent standard uTLIF, and the other group underwent uTLIF with PMMA augmentation. All patients were scheduled to attend a series of regular follow-up evaluations. Oswestry Disability Index, Japanese Orthopaedic Association score, visual analog scale score, lumbar lordotic angle, segmental lordotic angle, and disc space height (DSH) at each follow-up were collected and analyzed.
   RESULTS: The 2-year follow-up was completed by 24 patients in the uTLIF group and 23 patients in the PMMA group. Oswestry Disability Index, Japanese Orthopaedic Association score, and visual analog scale score showed significant improvements after surgery in both groups, with no significant difference between groups. DSH in the uTLIF group was 8.7 +/- 2.3 mm and in the PMMA group was 10.7 +/- 1.6 mm. Fusion rate in the uTLIF group was 19/24 and in the PMMA group was 21/23. DSH and fusion rate in the PMMA group were higher than those in the uTLIF group. No severe complications were observed after PMMA injection.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pedicle screw with PMMA augmentation can increase fixation stability and reduce DSH loss in uTLIF. Moreover, PMMA in the vertebral body did not impede the interbody fusion ability in uTLIF.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the parameters related to the high risk of preoperative seizures in infants (1 year or younger) with ruptured intracranial aneurysms.
   METHODS: Infants with ruptured intracranial aneurysms treated at our institution from January 2012 to January 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Seventeen similar cases of infant patients with seizures reported in published studies were reviewed.
   RESULTS: The mean age of the 7 infant patients treated at our institution was 4.1 +/- 3.3 months (range, 28 days to 11 months), with 2 male and 5 female subjects. One patient (14.3%) had an internal carotid artery aneurysm with subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the remaining 6 patients (85.7%) had middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms in the distal arterial region with lobe hemorrhage. Five of the 7 infants (71.4%) had seizures, 4 of whom (4/5, 80.0%) had MCA distal arterial aneurysms with lobe hemorrhage. Management was successful for all patients with aneurysm clipping or resection surgery, and one patient experienced postoperative seizures. Of the 17 reviewed cases of infant patients with seizures, 10 patients (58.8%) exhibited the typical distal arterial aneurysm with lobe hemorrhaging, and 6 (60%) of them had aneurysms in MCA.
   CONCLUSIONS: Infant patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms have a high risk of preoperative seizures. The typical radiologic finding of distal arterial aneurysm with lobe hemorrhage was frequently observed in the MCA, and it might be related to the high risk of preoperative seizures in this population. Microsurgical techniques effectively control postoperative seizures in infants with ruptured intracranial aneurysms.

AB OBJECTIVE: To introduce a method of accurately measuring the equivalent dose received by radiation-sensitive organs using the thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) and to provide reference values for future studies associated with radiation protection in patients undergoing lumbar spine surgeries.
   METHODS: After careful selection and preparation, TLD chips were used to obtain measurements from the eyes, thyroid glands, breasts, and gonads of 20 patients undergoing lumbar spine surgeries. The results were obtained via air kerma conversion-related calculations.
   RESULTS: The overall radiation exposures absorbed perioperatively by the eyes, thyroid glands, right breasts, left breasts, right ovaries, left ovaries, and testes were 0.41 +/- 0.13, 1.43 +/- 0.45, 6.95 +/- 3.63, 9.50 +/- 6.14, 29.86 +/- 28.62, 23.47 +/- 22.10, and 5.41 +/- 1.86 mSv, respectively. A single computed tomography (CT) scan contributed to more than 75% of the overall dose received regardless of the position used.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients received significantly higher radiation doses from CT scans than from regular digital radiograph examinations. These radiation doses were concentrated in the regional area of scanning. Our results indicate the necessity and benefits of radiation protection measures, especially for the organs researched herein, when patients undergoing lumbar surgeries require radiographic diagnostic examinations.

AB INTRODUCTION: Vertebral compression fractures are a common clinical occurrence in elderly individuals with osteoporosis. No current evidence exists on risk factors and clinical impact of discharge to inpatient (IP) care facility after vertebral augmentation procedures.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 2012-2014 American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database files were queried using Current Procedural Terminology codes for verte-broplasty (22520, 22521, and 22522) and kyphoplasty (22523, 22524, and 22525). Discharge to IP care facility included skilled-care facilities and IP rehabilitation units. A total of 2361 patients were included in the final cohort.
   RESULTS: Of 2361 patients, 1962 (83.1%) were discharged home and 399 (16.9%) were discharged to an IP care facility. Multivariate analysis identified age >= 65 years (P < 0.001), dependent preoperative functional health status (P < 0.001), hypertension (P = 0.001), preoperative transfusion (P = 0.043), IP admission status (P < 0.001), thoracolumbar procedure versus thoracic-only procedure (P = 0.012), and length of stay >1 day (P < 0.001) to be significant predictors for a discharge to an IP care facility. In addition, discharge to an IP care facility was associated with a significant greater risk of 30-day mortality (P = 0.001). No significant associations were found with between IP-care discharge destination and any 30-day complication, 30-day readmission, and 30-day reoperation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Discharge to IP care facilities after vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty is associated with a 3.6 times greater odds of mortality as compared with home discharge. Providers can use the risk profile data to better allow preoperative stratification of patients to ensure that discharge location is appropriate to a patient's need to minimize the risk of adverse outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Pineoblastomas are rare, malignant embryonal tumors that have a relatively higher incidence and a poorer prognosis in children. Owing to the rarity of these tumors, there is a paucity of data on associated prognostic factors. We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to evaluate prognostic factors for pineoblastomas with the aim of improving tumor management.
   METHODS: Data from all pediatric patients (age <= 17 years) diagnosed with pineoblastoma between 1990 and 2013 were extracted from the SEER-18 registry database. Survival was described with Kaplan-Meier curves. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for both univariate and multivariate analyses. A nomogram was established for predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) in patients with pineoblastoma.
   RESULTS: Age >5 years (P = 0.004) and radiotherapy treatment (P = 0.000) were associated with better rates of survival. Gross total resection (P = 0.054) also was correlated with better prognosis, whereas tumor size >30 mm in maximum diameter (P = 0.025) was associated with poorer outcome. A nomogram was established based on the results of the Cox model and was validated by a concordance index (C-index) of 0.767 (95% confidence interval, 0.698-0.836) and calibration plots.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the impact of tumor extension is not defined. OS is better in older children treated by radiotherapy, and gross total resection also appears to result in increased survival. A nomogram was built to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS for these patients.

ID DEFORMITIES
AB BACKGROUND: Although previous studies have used National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) data to study complications of thoracolumbar spinal deformity surgery, investigation of cervical spine deformity surgery has been limited. We performed a retrospective analysis of the NSQIP database to identify predictors of complications after cervical spine osteotomy.
   METHODS: Patients undergoing cervical spine osteotomy were identified in the NSQIP dataset using Current Procedural Terminology codes from years 2007-2016. For each patient, patient and case clinical characteristics, length of stay (LOS), and diagnosis of a nonneurologic complication (including reoperation and readmission) were abstracted. Patient and case clinical predictors of any of the reported complications and increased LOS were identified in multivariate logistic and Poisson regression analyses, respectively.
   RESULTS: There were 950 patients identified with mean age 56.1 +/- 12.4 years and mean body mass index 29.9 +/- 6.8. Mean LOS was 3.5 +/- 4.9 days. Overall medical complication rate was 15.8%. The most common complications were transfusion (78; 8.2%), readmission (45; 4.7%), reoperation (32; 3.4%), and reintubation (28; 3.0%). Risk factors for any complication included increased age (P = 0.0467), American Society of Anesthesiologists classification III (P = 0.0023) and IV (P = 0.0013), and increased operative duration (P < 0.0001). Risk factors for increased LOS were decreased functional status (P = 0.0037), disseminated cancer (P = 0.0061), American Society of Anesthesiologists classification III and IV (P < 0.0001), increased operative duration (P < 0.0001), and orthopaedic surgeon (vs. neurosurgeon) (P = 0.0156).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study is the largest to date of patients undergoing cervical osteotomy and provides useful clinical data for patient selection and counseling and 30-day reoperation and readmission rates.

TI Presurgical Thalamus and Brainstem Shifts Predict Distal Motor Function
   Recovery After Anatomic Hemispherectomy
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

ID NERVOUS-SYSTEM; ENCEPHALITIS; OUTCOMES; EPILEPSY; AGE
AB BACKGROUND: Anatomic hemispherectomy is an effective surgical treatment for patients with hemispherical intractable epilepsy. Different degrees of brain shifting have been observed, but whether these shifts can predict motor function recovery is unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between brain shift ratios of different brain areas and motor function before and after surgery.
   METHODS: Medical records and magnetic resonance imaging of 23 patients who underwent anatomic hemispherectomy from 2006 to 2013 at a single center were retrospectively reviewed. Proximal and distal muscle strengths of both arms and legs were measured before and after surgery to determine motor function outcomes. Brain shift ratios of frontal lobe, temporal lobe, parieto- occipital lobe, thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellum were measured before and after surgery to test which shifts could effectively predict motor function outcomes.
   RESULTS: Fifteen patients (65.2%) showed different degrees of presurgical brain shifting. Brain shift ratios of all measured brain areas were generally increased after anatomic hemispherectomy. After surgery, 13 patients (56.5%) exhibited improved proximal muscle strength, whereas 10 (43.5%) in distal. Significant correlations were found only between muscle strength improvements of distal arms or legs and presurgical brain shift ratios of thalamus or brainstem (all P < 0.05). Distal muscle strength improvements also correlated with age at seizure onset.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with hemispherical intractable epilepsy with larger presurgical shifts of thalamus and brainstem exhibited improved muscle strength, especially in distal muscles, after anatomic hemispherectomy. This result was more likely in patients who were older at the time of seizure onset. These presurgical shifts of thalamus and brainstem may be used for predicting motor function recovery after hemispherectomy for a subset of patients, which is beneficial for surgical planning.

AB BACKGROUND: Hypoglossal nerve injury may result in swallowing and speech problems. To reduce this morbidity and allow the performance of the hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis bilaterally, a technique that includes partial splitting of the hypoglossal nerve and skeletonization of the facial nerve within the mastoid process has been applied. The aim of this study is to present clinical results regarding the facial and hypoglossal nerves after the procedure.
   METHODS: Prospectively collected data from 56 consecutive patients who underwent hemihypoglossal- facial nerve anastomosis (HHFA) were analyzed. The outcome was correlated with epidemiologic data, initial disease, the presence of neurofibromatosis type 2, previous radiosurgery, and the time between nerve injury and reconstructive surgery.
   RESULTS: Forty-eight (84%) patients achieved satisfactory outcomes; 8 of them (14%) showed some improvement, and in 1 patient (2%) there was no improvement during long-term observation. The result at follow-up was not related to the time interval between the 2 procedures. However, recovery times for facial tonicity were statistically significantly longer if the procedure was performed after 12 months (P = 0.044). There was no statistically significant association between patient age (P = 0.96) or sex (P = 0.13) and facial nerve function. HHFA resulted in no or minimal tongue atrophy without deviation in 53 patients (93%), and the remainder had mild hemiatrophy with tongue deviation <30 degrees.
   CONCLUSIONS: HHFA is an effective technique for facial nerve reanimation with acceptable morbidity related to tongue function. Patients with a longer duration of facial palsy still have a good chance for restoration of facial movement but require longer recovery periods.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of surgeon specialty on 30-day postoperative complication rates for single-level lumbar discectomies.
   METHODS: All patients who underwent single-level lumbar discectomy between 2005 and 2014 were reviewed from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database. Propensity score matching and univariate binary regression was used to determine whether surgeon subspecialty had an influence on 30-day postoperative complications.
   RESULTS: Of the 28,863 patients who underwent single-level lumbar discectomies during 2005-2014, 12,659 patients met inclusion criteria. Orthopedic surgeons performed 3733 operations (29.4%), and neurosurgeons performed 8926 operations (70.6%). A propensity-score matched sample of 7464 total cases (3732 orthopedic surgeon, 3732 neurosurgeon) was analyzed for the effect of surgeon specialty on 30-day outcomes. After propensity matching, orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons were similar in all postoperative outcomes, except for a slightly higher frequency of blood transfusions (0.3%, n=11) in orthopedic versus neurosurgery patients (0.1%, n=3; P=0.032), although this did not remain significant after Bonferroni adjustment. Mean operative time was slightly longer for neurosurgeons (83.7 minutes) versus orthopedic surgeons (72.5 minutes; P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in mortality, readmission, or reoperation rates.
   CONCLUSIONS: Single-level lumbar discectomies hold a low complication profile and show equivalent outcomes for both orthopedic and neurological surgeons, although neurosurgeons may exhibit a slightly longer mean operative time. In propensity score-matched cohorts, orthopedic surgeons had slightly higher rates of blood transfusions, although the number was small and did not remain significant after Bonferroni adjustment.

AB OBJECTIVE: Pedicle screw placement remains challenging. The present study focuses on the comparison between 2 intraoperative-based neuronavigation systems (O-Arm and AIRO) during thoracolumbar screw instrumentation. -
   METHODS: This is a prospective, comparative, nonrandomized study conducted in 2 French academic centers. The O-Arm was used at the University Hospital of Bordeaux, whereas the AIRO was used at the University Hospital of Marseille. Routine computed tomography was performed on postoperative day 2 to evaluate pedicle screw placement. Measures of radiation exposure were extracted directly from reports provided by each system. The effective dose was calculated.
   RESULTS: Overall, 74 screws were placed in 11 patients in the O-Arm group and 84 in 11 patients in the AIRO group. In the first group, 90.8% were rated as acceptable and 92.2% in the second (P > 0.05) according to the Heary and Gertzbein classifications, respectively, for thoracic and lumbar spine. Differences between both implantation systems were significant (P < 0.05) concerning dose length product (235 and 1039 mGy/cm, in O-Arm and AIRO, respectively), overall mean radiation dose received by 1 patient (3.52 and 15.6 mSv in O-Arm and AIRO, respectively), mean radiation dose per single scan (2.58 and 8.7 mSv in O-Arm and AIRO, respectively), mean effective dose per instrumented level (1.04 and 3.9 mSv in O-Arm and AIRO, respectively), and radiation dose received by the primary surgeon (0.63 and 0 mSv in O-Arm and AIRO, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative computed tomographye-based navigation is a major innovation that improves the accuracy of pedicle screw positioning with acceptable patient radiation exposure and reduced surgical team exposure.

AB BACKGROUND: Expansile duraplasty is frequently performed during Chiari I decompression. Aseptic and bacterial meningitis are possible complications of this procedure. We sought to compare the rates of meningitis and subsequent need for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion with duraplasty using bovine pericardial (BPC) xenograft and allograft.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 112 patients who underwent Chiari I decompression. All patients underwent duraplasty with either allograft or BPC. Occurrence of postoperative lumbar punctures and associated data were recorded to determine rates of meningitis. Rates of subsequent shunting were also recorded.
   RESULTS: Overall, 112 patients were included in the study: 30 underwent duraplasty with allograft (27%) and 82 received BPC (73%). A total of 26 patients developed postoperative meningitis (23 cases of chemical meningitis and 3 of bacterial meningitis). Rates of meningitis were higher in patients who received BPC than patients who received allograft (28% vs. 10%, respectively; P = 0.047). The rate of shunting was greater in patients with meningitis compared with patients without meningitis (56.5% vs. 5.75%, respectively; P < 0.0001). Moreover, 13 of the 15 patients (87%) in the BPC cohort who were shunted were found to have meningitis compared with 0 of the 3 shunted patients (0%) in the allograft cohort (P = 0.044).
   CONCLUSIONS: We found that rates of total meningitis were greater in patients who underwent Chiari I decompression and duraplasty with BPC compared with an allograft. The rate of shunting was significantly higher for patients who developed meningitis after decompression compared with patients without meningitis.

AB BACKGROUND: With the increase in the aging population and unhealthy lifestyles, the prevalence of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) continues to increase. The secondary injury to brain tissue after ICH might play a significant role in the prognosis of the patient; however, the underlying mechanisms of this process are unclear. This study aimed to explore the function of the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-dependent pathway in inflammatory injury and apoptosis in the perihematoma tissues of patients with ICH.
   METHODS: We included 24 patients who were diagnosed with hypertensive supratentorial ICH and collected perihematoma tissue samples from them. We explored the pathologic changes and the expression of TLR4, MYD88, nuclear factor kB, and CASPASE-3 in these tissues.
   RESULTS: In patients with ICH, the pathologic changes appeared within 6 hours of the onset of disease, peaked (maximum damage) at 24-72 hours, and the damage subsided after 72 hours. The expression of TLR4, MYD88, nuclear factor kB, and CASPASE-3 began to increase within 6 hours after ICH, peaked during 24-72 hours after ICH, and decreased after 72 hours.
   CONCLUSIONS: The TLR4-mediated MyD88-dependent pathway plays a significant role in the mechanism of tissue injury after ICH in human tissues. Our study sheds light on the regulation of inflammation and apoptosis as potential novel targets to prevent secondary injury after ICH. Moreover, our results indicate that the optimal window for antiinflammation and antiapoptosis treatment is within 6 hours after ICH.

ID ENDOSCOPIC 3RD VENTRICULOSTOMY; BRAIN-TUMORS; BIOPSY; HYDROCEPHALUS;
   CHILDREN
AB BACKGROUND: Ventricular tumors (VTs) represent approximately 10% of intracranial lesions and are associated with hydrocephalus in 73.9%-100% of patients. We present our experience using flexible neuroendoscopy as a diagnostic and hydrocephalus-related treatment strategy for paraventricular and intraventricular tumors.
   METHODS: This retrospective cohort included 27 pediatric and 21 adult patients with paraventricular or intraventricular tumors treated with flexible neuroendoscopy. Terminally ill patients and patients with incomplete data were excluded.
   RESULTS: Male and female patients comprised 52% and 48% of the population, respectively. Mean patient age was 20.45 years (+/- 18.65 SD). The most common tumor location was the thalamic and pineal region. Conclusive pathologic diagnosis was obtained in 40 patients (83.3%); the most common type of tumor was astrocytoma. Hydrocephalus was present in 38 (79.1%) patients, who were treated successfully with endoscopic procedures. There were no major complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Flexible neuroendoscopy is a strategic tool for diagnosis of VTs, especially in patients with associated hydrocephalus and VTs unreachable by other means. Flexible neuroendoscopy has a high rate of definitive diagnosis with low associated complications. More studies evaluating the long-term efficacy of flexible neuroendoscopy for hydrocephalus associated with VTs are needed.

AB BACKGROUND: Awake craniotomy (AC) is generally a safe and effective procedure; however, a small but not insignificant portion of cases are aborted due to patient intolerance of the awake portion of surgery. There is not yet a firm understanding of what characteristics indicate patient tolerance or failure of AC.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a single-surgeon database of patients treated by AC over a 5-year period. Charts were reviewed for demographic, clinical, and operative characteristics, including anesthetic administration during the awake portion of surgery. Statistical analysis was performed to determine which factors predicted patient tolerance or failure.
   RESULTS: Our study cohort comprised 120 patients with an average age of 56.0 +/- 15.2 years. A majority of patients were male (55.8%). The most common surgical indication was tumor (95.8%), with gliobastoma as the most common diagnosis (43.3%). Male sex predicted surgical tolerance on univariate analysis (P = 0.015). Remifentanil administration was associated with surgical failure on univariate analysis (P = 0.068), and also predicted failure on multi-variate analysis (P = 0.030). Preoperative seizure, ketamine administration, and right-sided surgery each predicted patient tolerance, but did not achieve statistical significance. Similarly, respiratory comorbidity was associated with surgical failure, but did not achieve significance.
   CONCLUSIONS: AC remains an effective treatment option; the majority of patients tolerate the procedure without issue. Male patients have lower rates of surgical failure, whereas remifentanil administration may increase failure rate.

AB OBJECTIVE: Bad news refers to information that subjectively impedes a patient's future prospects. Patients with intracranial tumors potentially face numerous pieces of bad news. This study assessed the patients' perspective regarding the content of bad news, patients' preferences for the communication of bad news, and clinical consequences of mismatch of patients' communication preferences.
   METHODS: We included 42 patients with an intracranial tumor shortly after neurosurgical tumor removal. Patients' preferences for communication of bad news was assessed via the Measure of Patients' Preferences Scale. Various areas of patients' psychosocial well-being were included (e.g., depression or quality of life).
   RESULTS: At this early stage of the disease trajectory, patients with a brain tumor had already received on average 2.2 (standard deviation, 1.38; range, 0-6) pieces of bad news. For most patients, these pieces included receiving the initial diagnosis. Patients reported a multitude of communication preferences, some highly specific for patients with brain tumors. On average, 30% of these preferences were not matched with the physicians' behavior. Communication mismatch was associated with lower patient satisfaction regarding information but no other areas of psychosocial well-being.
   CONCLUSIONS: Communicating bad news to the patient with a brain tumor in a way that is appreciated by the patient is a complex and demanding endeavor for the treating physician. Meeting patients' needs not only requires the skills regarding the communication of cancer-related news but also accounting for the specific needs ascribable to the neurologic features of the disease (e.g., regarding neuropsychological impairment or neurosurgical treatment).

AB OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the independent effect of complications on 30-day mortality in 32,695 patients undergoing elective craniotomy.
   METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program was queried for patients undergoing elective craniotomy from 2006 to 2015. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the effect of complications on mortality independent of preoperative risk and other postoperative complications. This effect was further assessed in risk-stratified patient subgroups using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Surgical Risk Calculator.
   RESULTS: Of 13 complications analyzed, the 5 most strongly associated with mortality independent of preoperative risk factors were unplanned intubation (odds ratio [OR], 12.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.5-15.4; P < 0.001), stroke (OR, 11.1; 95% CI, 8.3-14.9; P < 0.001), ventilator requirement > 48 hours after surgery (OR, 9.9; 95% CI, 7.9-12.6; P < 0.001), and renal failure (OR, 8.5; 95% CI, 4.4-16.2; P < 0.001). These same complications were also the 5 most associated with mortality independent of other postoperative complications. They were also associated with mortality across all risk-stratified patient subgroups. On the contrary, venous thromboembolism (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.98-1.7; P[0.06), urinary tract infection (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.76-1.6; P [0.61), unplanned reoperation (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.83-1.4; P=0.55), and surgical site infection (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.18-0.71; P=0.004) showed no significant link with increased mortality independent of other complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Of 13 complications analyzed, myocardial infarction, unplanned intubation, prolonged ventilator requirement, stroke, and renal failure showed the strongest association with mortality independent of preoperative risk, independent of other complications, and across all risk-stratified subgroups. These findings help identify causes of perioperative mortality after elective craniotomy. Dedicating additional resources toward preventing and treating these complications postoperatively may help reduce rates of failure-to-rescue in the neurosurgical population.

   RECOMMENDATIONS; STRATEGIES; GUIDELINES
AB OBJECTIVE: Partially thrombosed intracranial aneurysms (PTIAs) represent a challenging subgroup of aneurysms, with an organized intraluminal thrombus and a solid mass, in which the optimal therapeutic strategy is discussed controversially because of limited data. We therefore analyzed the results of surgical and endovascular treatment in patients with PTIAs treated in our department and combined the results with a systematic literature review.
   METHODS: Between January 2006 and October 2016, data from 996 patients with intracranial aneurysms were prospectively entered into a database. Twenty-five consecutive patients harbored PTIAs and were treated in the authors' institution. The degree of aneurysm occlusion, the degree of recurrence, and the necessity of aneurysm retreatment were assessed and analyzed. PubMed was searched for published studies of PTIAs to gain a larger population. Multivariate regression models were performed on the pooled data.
   RESULTS: Literature data, including the present series, revealed a total of 157 patients. Overall, 64 patients (41%) were treated by clipping, and 93 patients (59%) were treated by endovascular treatment. In the multivariate analysis, surgical treatment of PTIAs was an independent predictor for complete aneurysm occlusion (P < 0.001). In a second multivariate model, endovascular treatment was independently associated with aneurysm recurrence (P < 0.001). In a third multivariate model, endovascular treatment was associated with a higher rate of retreatment (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: In this study, surgical treatment of PTIAs showed superior initial radiologic results and better long-term stability than endovascular treatment. Therefore, surgical treatment should be considered in those patients harboring PTIAs who are qualified as suitable surgical candidates after interdisciplinary consensus.

AB BACKGROUND: Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) is a rare, benign neoplasm predominantly associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. Clinical outcomes have largely been conveyed via small- and medium-sized case series.
   METHODS: With the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER)-18 registry database, information from all patients diagnosed with SEGA from 2004 to 2013 was obtained (age, sex, race, marital status, tumor size, tumor location, occurrence of surgery, receipt of radiation, and follow-up data). Age-adjusted incidence rates and overall survival (OS) were determined. Cox proportional hazards model was used for both univariate and multivariate analyses.
   RESULTS: The overall incidence of SEGA within the SEER-18 database is 0.027 per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval, 0.024-0.031). A total of 226 cases were identified. For OS, univariate analysis revealed age younger than 18 years (hazard ratio [HR], 0.214; P = 0.004) and occurrence of surgery (HR, 0.328; P = 0.039) were significant positive prognostic factors. Sex, marital status, race, tumor size, tumor location, and receipt of radiation did not exhibit significant relationships. Interestingly, subanalysis for extent of resection to gross total resection did not show benefit. Multivariate analysis revealed that both age younger than 18 years (HR, 0.193; P = 0.002) and occurrence of surgery (HR, 0.286; P = 0.021) remained significant.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on our analysis, younger age and occurrence of surgery are significant independent factors associated with better OS. There was no support for radiation.

AB OBJECTIVE: Meningiomas that compress the optic nerve (ON) can lead to different visual outcomes depending on the segment of ON affected (intraorbital, canalicular, and intracranial). In this study, we performed a comprehensive comparison of the management options (surgery, radiation, or observation alone) for meningiomas compressing the ON, categorized by location and relation to the ON.
   METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews databases were searched according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. Data were extracted from the articles regarding anatomic location, initial visual impairment, surgical procedure, visual outcome, morbidity and mortality, gross total removal, and requirement for postoperative radiotherapy.
   RESULTS: Of the 47 articles eligible for full-text reading, 9 surgical studies met our inclusion criteria. Data from 317 patient cases were extracted. In patients in whom the intracranial segment of the ON was impaired in isolation, 49% experienced visual improvement after surgery. When the meningioma affected the canalicular segment or intraorbital segment, visual improvement after surgery was 31% and 11%, respectively. Of patients who underwent surgery for the intraorbital segment of the ON, 56% experienced a decline in visual outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: When a neurosurgeon deals with a meningioma compressing the ON, opening the optic canal is suggested if invasion is suspected on the preoperative imaging. Extra caution should be used when operating on meningiomas with ON sheath adhesion, given the higher evidence of postoperative visual worsening.

AB BACKGROUND: Temporal bone tegmen defects may be associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) otorrhea. A variety of techniques have been used for repair. We report our experience with skull base reconstruction for tegmen defects using either autologous or alloplastic grafts.
   METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with tegmen defects treated from 2007 to 2017 at the University Hospital in Columbia, Missouri, USA. Primary outcome measures were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were treated with a middle cranial fossa approach (median age 53, 88% females, median body mass index 34, median follow-up 9 months). Presenting symptoms included CSF leak (92%), hearing loss (44%), imbalance (12%), meningitis (12%), headache (4%), and tinnitus (4%). Most tegmen defects occurred spontaneously (84%) but cholesteatomas (4%), and trauma (12%) also were identified. Pre - and post-operative audiograms were available for 13 patients (52%); 7 (54%) showed objective improvement. Fourteen patients were repaired with autologous bone graft (56%), 7 with alloplastic grafts (28%), and 4 with temporalis fascia only (16%). All patients had resolution of CSF leak. Two patients (8%) suffered wound infections and 3 (12%) had facial and/or petrosal nerve complications. Use of alloplastic graft significantly shortened operative time (allopathic mean 180 minutes vs. autologous mean 208 minutes; P = 0.03).
   CONCLUSIONS: CSF otorrhea due to tegmen defects can be repaired via a middle fossa craniotomy using either an autologous or alloplastic graft with equivalent outcomes and efficacy, although alloplastic graft helps reduce operating time.

AB OBJECTIVE: Induced hypernatremia is frequently used to reduce intracranial pressure in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). This technique is controversial, and some studies have independently associated hypernatremia with worse outcomes after TBI. We sought to investigate this potential association in a large healthcare database.
   METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to obtain data on all adults who had been discharged from 2002 to 2011 with a primary diagnosis of TBI who required mechanical ventilation, intracranial pressure monitoring, or craniotomy/craniectomy. Patients with diabetes insipidus were excluded. The patients with hypernatremia were assigned to the hypernatremia group, and the rest were assigned to the control group. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcomes included the length of stay, nonroutine hospital discharge, total hospital charges, tracheostomy, and gastrostomy placement.
   RESULTS: A total of 85,579 patients without a diagnosis of hypernatremia (control group) and 4542 patients with a diagnosis of hypernatremia (hypernatremia group) were identified. When controlling for age, comorbidities, gender, and cerebral edema, hypernatremia was associated with an increased rate of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.39-1.65), a longer mean length of stay (23.65 vs. 12.12 days; P < 0.001), an increased rate of nonroutine hospital discharge (odds ratio, 2.58; 95% confidence interval, 2.28-2.92), and greater mean total hospital cost ($227,112 vs. $112,507; P < 0.001). The patients with hypernatremia also had greater rates of tracheostomy and gastrostomy placement.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hypernatremia was associated with poorer outcomes in patients with severe TBI. This finding warrants further investigation in a prospective, randomized study.

AB OBJECTIVE: Classical trigeminal neuralgia (cTN) is rarely caused by ectatic vertebrobasilar artery compression of the trigeminal nerve. These patients present a surgical challenge and often are not considered for microvascular decompression (MVD) due to assumed risk.
   METHODS: A review of patients who were surgically treated by the senior author between 1997 and 2016 with an admitting diagnosis of cTN was performed. Details of the surgery were documented, including the technique for maintaining vascular decompression, complications, and the length of stay. Clinical follow-up was obtained from patient charts as well as telephone questionnaires.
   RESULTS: During the 20-year review, 552 patients underwent MVD for cTN, and 13 (2.4%) had dolichoectatic vertebrobasilar compressions (10 male, 3 female). The average hospital length of stay was 2.8 days (range 2-7) with no major complications. At final follow-up (> 2 years), 7 had no pain with nomedications (78%), 2 had persistent pain (22%)-1 of whom underwent a successful glycerol rhizotomy at 8 months-2 were lost to follow-up, and 2 had surgery within 2 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cTN due to a dolichoectatic vertebrobasilar artery compression present a unique surgical challenge. Mobilizing the vessel can be difficult because it may be firm from atherosclerosis, maintaining its separation from the nerve is similarly difficult, and manipulating the vessel can be dangerous because of its brainstem perforators. Our case series provides some evidence to support the safety and efficacy of MVD for patients with vertebrobasilar ectasia for those that major surgery is not contraindicated.

AB BACKGROUND: Previous studies reported an association of hematologic parameters, including white blood cells, neutrophil, eosinophils, or coagulation-related factors, with prognosis in cerebrovascular disorders. However, an association of recurrence rate with serum coagulation-related factors (e.g., D-dimer or fibrinogen degradation products [FDP]) in chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is unclear.
   METHODS: Ninety-two patients who experienced first-time CSDH treated with burr-hole hematoma evacuation were included in this study. Laboratory data on admission were used to divide patients into 2 groups: serum FDP > 5 mg/mL or FDP <= 5 mg/mL (within normal range), based on the reference range of our institute. We retrospectively compared the recurrence rate of CSDH within 90 days after the first operation between these groups. Statistical significance was accepted at P < 0.05.
   RESULTS: Patients with an FDP greater than 5 mg/mL showed a significantly increased recurrence rate compared with those with a normal FDP (<= 5 mg/mL; 27.3% vs. 10.2%, respectively; P = 0.03). Patients with an FDP greater than 5 mg/mL also showed a significantly higher recurrence rate within 30 days after the operation (15.2% vs. 3.4%, respectively; P = 0.04), but no difference in the recurrence rate at 31-90 days after the operation (12.1% vs. 6.8%, respectively; P = 0.38). In multivariable analysis, monolayer hematoma (odds ratio, 7.61; P = 0.003) and an FDP > 5 mg/mL (odds ratio, 5.04; P= 0.01) were independent predictive factors for recurrence within 90 days.
   CONCLUSIONS: Elevated serum FDP on admission is a novel predictive factor for the recurrence of CSDH. These patients require careful follow-up, and recurrence within 30 days after the first operation should be considered.

AB OBJECTIVE: To introduce an innovative surgical technique, transvertebral bone graft and augmentation (TBGA), to and evaluate its clinical efficacy in treating osteoporotic vertebral body compression fractures (VCFs), with balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) as a control.
   METHODS: A total of 81 patients with a single-level osteoporotic VCF underwent TBGA (n = 38) or BKP (n = 43) at our hospital between October 2012 and January 2015. The average duration of follow-up period was 27.9 months. The patients were evaluated with plain radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, at 3 - and 6-month follow-ups, and every 6 months thereafter. Clinical status was assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and a visual analog scale (VAS). In addition, parameters of anterior vertebral body height (AVBH), kyphosis angle (KA), adjacent segment degeneration (ASD), and complications were also compared between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: Significant clinical improvements in ODI, VAS scores, AVBH, and KA were seen in both the TBGA and BKP groups after surgery (P < 0.05). However, the differences in improvements in ODI and VAS between the TBGA and BKP groups were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The improvements in AVBH and KA were significantly better in the TBGA group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the rates of ASD and complications were significantly lower in the TBGA group during the follow-up period (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: TBGA is an effective and safe surgical technique that appears to be a promising alternative to BKP for the surgical treatment of osteoporotic VCFs.

   VASCULAR COMPRESSION; TRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA; ZONE; PORTION; MYELIN
AB BACKGROUND: Microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm is performed at the root exit zone. More proximal segments of the facial nerve, defined as the root emerging zone (REmZ), may also be susceptible to neurovascular compression. Consequently, detailed knowledge of the microanatomy around facial nerve fibers at the pontomedullary junction is essential for consistent success of microvascular decompression.
   METHODS: Five human brainstems obtained from cadavers were investigated using correlative light microscopy and block-face imaging, which obtains arbitrary two-dimensional light microscopic and three-dimensional volume data from a single specimen. The entire facial nerve pathway, including the myelin transition, was evaluated inside and outside the brainstem.
   RESULTS: Correlative light microscopy and block-face imaging showed the intra-brainstem facial nerve fibers emerging at the brainstem surface deep at the pontomedullary sulcus (REmZ) and coursing along the pontine surface before detaching from the pons (root exit zone). An acute emerging angle significantly increased the surface area with central myelin. The facial nerve bundle formed 1 fasciculus in the portion covered by central myelin but divided into 2 fasciculi in the myelin transitional portion and then into multiple fasciculi more distally. Arteries around the REmZ were often anchored by perforating branches entangled with lower cranial nerves.
   CONCLUSIONS: Facial nerve fibers are susceptible to vascular compression on emerging onto the deep brainstem surface at the pontomedullary sulcus. The key procedure in microvascular decompression is full dissection of the lower cranial nerves down to the brainstem origin to explore both the root exit zone and the REmZ.

AB OBJECTIVE: To define radiologic parameters and the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography (CT) scan on posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) injury, identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with thoracolumbar (TL) fracture.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 88 patients with TL fractures divided into 2 groups by PLC status evident on MRI: intact and ruptured. The parameters assessed included the anterior fractured vertebral body height (AVH) and posterior fractured vertebral body height, upper and lower AVH, anterior/posterior vertebral height ratio, AVH ratio, local kyphotic angle (LKA), region angle (RA), sagittal index (SI), Gardner angle (GA), Gardner index (GI), Cobb angle, interspinous distance (ISD), upper and lower ISD, ISD ratio, interspinous distance minus (ISDM), interspinous angle (ISA), and upper and lower ISA. The t test, Pearson chi(2) test, and multivariate logistic regression were used.
   RESULTS: PLC rupture (vs. intact) was associated with RA, GA, GI, ISD, ISD ratio, and ISDM. The positive risk factors for PLC rupture were GA, LKA, SI, and RA. The negative risk factors for PLC rupture were SI greater than 20 degrees and GI. PLC rupture was associated with the SI, upper interspinous distance, ISD ratio, ISDM, and ISA in those with type A1/A2 fractures and the GA, GI, ISD, ISD ratio, and ISDM in those with type A3/A4 fractures.
   CONCLUSIONS: An RA greater than 16 degrees, SI greater than 20 degrees, and GI greater than 24 degrees were associated with PLC injury in patients with type A TL fractures, and an RA greater than 16 degrees and SI greater than 20 degrees predicted PLC injury in type A1 and A2 fractures. An SI greater than 20 degrees, GI greater than 24 degrees, LKA greater than 26 degrees, and ISD ratio greater than 56% predicted PLC injury in type A3 and A4 fractures.

ID CRANIAL NERVES
AB OBJECTIVE: The surgical approach for the trigeminal nerve involves veins connected to the superior petrosal and tentorial sinus, and we should pay special attention to these veins. We investigated intraoperative and postoperative bleeding using our database.
   METHODS: A prospectively accumulated database of 247 microvascular decompression surgeries for trigeminal neuralgia over the past 10 years was analyzed. Intraoperative and postoperative bleeding was confirmed with surgical records, videos, and computed tomography. Of 235 patients, 161 were female; 85 patients were > 70 years old at the time of surgery; 96 surgeries involved the left side.
   RESULTS: Intraoperative venous bleeding was encountered in 29 surgeries (12%): from the superior petrosal vein/sinus in 18 and the hemispheric bridging vein/tentorial sinus in 11. Massive bleeding occurred from the superior petrosal sinus owing to tear of the entrance of the superior petrosal vein in 4 surgeries and from the tentorial sinus in 3; bleeding was controlled by Surgicel with fibrin glue. Postoperative bleeding occurred in 11 surgeries (4%): intracerebellar hematoma in 2, subarachnoid hemorrhage in 3, subdural hemorrhage in 3, supratentorial subdural hemorrhage in 2, and supratentorial epidural hematoma in 1. These lesions were associated with intraoperative bleeding in 1 case, a trans-horizontal fissure approach in 1 case, coagulation of the petrosal vein in 2 cases, and unknown reasons in 7 cases. Cure without medication was achieved in 218 surgeries at an average follow-up of 4.2 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: Microvascular decompression for trigeminal neuralgia involves potential risks of intraoperative and postoperative bleeding.

AB OBJECTIVE: To report the comprehensive long-term functional and quality of life outcomes after craniectomy (CE) and craniotomy (CO) in individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI).
   METHODS: Information on all individuals with TBI who had undergone CE or CO were extracted from the TBI Model Systems database from 2002 to 2012. A 1:1 propensity matching with replacement technique was used to balance the baseline characteristics across groups. The matched sample was analyzed for outcomes during hospitalization, acute rehabilitation, and <= 2 years of follow-up.
   RESULTS: We identified 1470 individuals who had undergone CE or CO. Individuals undergoing CE compared with CO demonstrated a longer length of stay in the hospital (median, 22 vs. 18 days; P < 0.0001) and acute rehabilitation (median 26 vs. 21 days; P < 0.0001). Individuals with CE had required rehospitalization more often by the 1-year follow-up point (39% vs. 25%; P < 0.0001) for reasons other than cranioplasty, including seizures (12% vs. 8%; P < 0.0001), neurologic events (i.e., hydrocephalus; 9% vs. 4%; P < 0.0001), and infections (10% vs 6%; P < 0.0001). Individuals with CE had significantly greater impairment using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended, required more supervision, and were less likely to be employed at 1 and 2 years after TBI. No difference was observed in the satisfaction with life scale scores at 2 years. The Kaplan-Meier mortality estimates at 1 and 2 years showed no differences between the 2 groups (hazard ratio, 0.57; P = 0.4).
   CONCLUSION: In a matched cohort, individuals undergoing CE compared with CO after TBI had a longer length of stay, decreased functional status, and more rehospitalizations. The survival at 2 years and the satisfaction with life scale scores were similar.

Although better outcomes have been observed from these studies, the definition of early surgery has been controversial, although mostly limited to 24-hours after injury. For some hospitals, this early surgery could be difficult to implement in practice. Hence, we re-evaluated the timing of early surgery as surgery within 48 hours and investigated the surgical outcomes of SCI depending on whether surgery was performed early (<= 48 hours) or late (>48 hours). The primary outcomes were improvement in the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade in early and late surgery groups. -
   METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort study in individuals aged 15-85 years, who underwent surgery for SCI between 2005 and 2016. The rate of AIS grade improvements was measured at 6 months after injury. Of the 86 enrolled patients, 31 (mean, 40.9 +/- 12.64 hours) and 55 (mean, 168.25 +/- 93.01 hours) patients were assigned to the early and late surgery groups, respectively.
   RESULTS: AIS grade improvement was significantly greater in the early than in the late group (P = 0.039). In the early group, there was no significant difference in neurologic improvements among the AIS B, C, and D groups, but the AIS A group showed a significant improvement (P = 0.015). This finding was not observed in the late group (P = 0.060). AIS grade improvement was also significantly greater in the incomplete SCI group than in the complete SCI group, for all measurements (early, P = 0.007, late, P = 0.009). Other factors that significantly affected clinical outcomes were AIS grade on admission and the level of the injury.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and accuracy of anatomic- and lateral fluoroscopic-guided placement of C2 pars/pedicle, C1 lateral mass screws, and freehand placement of C2 laminar screws.
   METHODS: All the patients who underwent posterior cervical/occipitocervical fixation that involved the placement of C1/C2 screws during a 5-year period (2011-2015) at our institute were included in this study.
   RESULTS: C1/C2 screws were placed in a total of 94 patients during this period. A total of 97 C1 lateral mass, 49 C2 pars, 24 C2 pedicle, and 82 C2 laminar screws were placed in these patients. C1 lateral mass screws and C2 pars/pedicle screws were placed under anatomic and lateral fluoroscopic guidance. C2 laminar screws were placed by a freehand technique. The mean length (range) of various C2 screws was 16.4 +/- 2.6 mm (12-22 mm) for pars screws, 18.8 +/- 2.7 mm (14-24 mm) for pedicle screws, and 25.6 +/- 3.4 mm (18-32 mm) for laminar screws. Postoperative CT imaging done in all patients before discharge revealed malposition of 2 laminar screws with breach of the inner cortex. The position of the remaining C1/C2 screws was perfect. The superior and medial angulation of the pars screws and superior angulation of the pedicle screws as measured in postoperative CT images were found to significantly deviate from the angles described in the literature. There was no mortality, vertebral artery injury, or neurologic injury related to C1/C2 screw placement in this series.
   CONCLUSIONS: Anatomic and lateral fluoroscopic-guided placement of C2 pars/pedicle screws and C1 lateral mass screws and freehand placement of C2 laminar screws is extremely safe.

AB OBJECTIVE: Many studies have been performed to evaluate the roles of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor (PGR) in meningiomas, but their influence on tumor behavior remains unclear.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients with meningioma who underwent surgical resection at our institute. Patients with data for immunohistochemical staining of estrogen receptor, PGR, and Ki-67 were included.
   RESULTS: The study included 161 patients comprising 61 skull base and 100 non-skull base meningiomas. Histologically, the number of patients with World Health Organization (WHO) grade I, II, and III disease were 132 (82.0%), 22 (14.7%), and 7 (4.4%), respectively. Tumor recurrence was observed in 21 (13.0%). Negative PGR, high Ki-67 index, incomplete resection, and WHO grade II or III were significantly correlated with tumor recurrence and shorter recurrence-free survival. Skull base meningiomas were difficult to remove entirely; 31 patients (50.8%) with skull base and 77 patients (77.0%) with non-skull base meningiomas had overall complete removal (P = 0.0006). Ki-67 indices, proportion of WHO grade II or III, and recurrence rate or recurrence-free survival did not differ between the tumor locations. The only difference was the proportion of patients with positive PGR, which was significantly higher for skull base meningiomas (61.5 +/- 33.4% vs. 42.2 +/- 35.7%, P = 0.0009).
   CONCLUSIONS: Although skull base meningiomas are often incompletely resected, there were no differences in recurrence-free survival or recurrence rate between skull base and non-skull base meningiomas. As the Ki-67 index and WHO grade were not different between these locations, the high rate of positive PGR may be responsible for the benign biology of skull base meningiomas.

   PREDICTORS; ANATOMY
AB BACKGROUND: Surgical decompression of the ulnar nerve (UN) is effective for treating cubital tunnel syndrome (CubTS). Nevertheless, the outcome is not always satisfying. Different surgical, clinical, and imaging findings have been claimed as outcome predictors, but there is no consensus in the literature. We analyzed the outcome predicting role of ultrasonography (US) of the UN in patients with CubTS and its possible role for diagnosis and follow-up.
   METHODS: Patients with CubTS treated by simple UN decompression underwent US and electrodiagnotic (ED) studies of the UN at the elbow before and after surgery. Outcome was evaluated through the Bishop scale. A correlation analysis between pre- and postoperative clinical, US, and ED findings was performed.
   RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were enrolled. Preoperatively, we observed a negative correlation between the motor conduction velocity (MCV) and the transverse (TD) and anteroposterior diameters and cross-sectional area (CSA) of the UN at the precubital (P = 0.001, P = 0.001, P = 0.005) and cubital level (P = 0.02, P = 0.002, P = 0.001). Preoperative precubital TD and CSA were associated with outcome (P = 0.01, P = 0.006) and postoperative MCV (P = 0.004, P = 0.008). The cut-off values TD >6 mm and CSA >23.91 mm(2) were predictors of poor outcome. Finally, postoperative cubital TD and CSA values were inversely correlated with outcome (P = 0.0002, P = 0.0007) and postoperative MCV (P = 0.0002, P = 0.0004).
   CONCLUSIONS: The US examination of the UN is useful for the management of patients with CubTS as an adjunct to clinical and ED evaluations. US measurements are correlated with pre- and postoperative ED findings and thus are useful for diagnosis and follow-up. Interestingly, specific precubital US measurements are good predictors of outcome.

DT Article
DE Carotid endarterectomy; Long-term outcomes; Retrospective study
ID VASCULAR SURGICAL-PROCEDURES; SPECIALTY
AB BACKGROUND: Long-term outcome data for patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) are lacking. As most of the published literature on CEA outcomes has been from high-volume providers, we wanted to investigate the outcomes of an average-volume cerebrovascular neurosurgeon.
   METHODS: We reviewed a single neurosurgeon's experience with CEA focusing on long-term outcomes. Most procedures (99.0%) were performed with primary closure of the arteriotomy.
   RESULTS: We studied 192 CEAs performed between 1998 and 2017, 77% for symptomatic disease. Two patients (1%) experienced immediate postoperative stroke. During an average follow-up of 53 months (range, 0-205 months), 2 more patients (1%) experienced ipsilateral carotid circulation stroke, and 5 patients (2.6%) experienced ipsilateral transient ischemic attacks. Five patients (2.6%) experienced contralateral transient ischemic attacks, and 6 (3.1%) experienced contralateral stroke. There were also 3 cases of (1.6%) hemorrhagic stroke and 6 cases (3.1%) of vertebrobasilar circulation stroke. The rate of ipsilateral stroke-free survival was 98.4% at 5 years post-CEA, 97.9% at 10 years post-CEA, and 97.9% at 15 years post-CEA. The rate of ipsilateral restenosis-free survival was 97.9% at 5 years post-CEA, 96.8% at 10 years post-CEA, and 96.8% at 15 years post-CEA. Six patients (3.1%) experienced restenosis > 70% during follow-up. Two of these patients underwent carotid artery stenting. Almost all patients (>95%) were maintained on an antiplatelet medication and statin.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the hands of an average-volume cerebrovascular neurosurgeon, CEA can provide durable protection from recurrent stroke in the ipsilateral carotid distribution that extends beyond 15 years. Thus, this procedure should be considered the gold standard against which other revascularization modalities should be evaluated.

AB OBJECTIVE: Although many studies have investigated the benefits of multimodal intraoperative monitoring (MIOM) during cervical spine surgery, the benefits of MIOM in craniovertebral junction (CVJ) surgery remain unclear. The objectives of the present study were to report our clinical experience in CVJ surgery with the use of MIOM and to identify risk factors that could affect MIOM changes during surgery of CVJ pathology.
   METHODS: We reviewed the MIOM records of 146 patients who had undergone high cervical spinal surgery. The patients were grouped by the MIOM data recorded during surgery; the patients were included in either the MIOM or non-MIOM change group. The analyzed risk factors included demographic, myelopathy, preoperative Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score, spinal cord diameter, and surgical factors. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for changes in MIOM data during surgery and postoperative neurological deficits.
   RESULTS: Our results revealed that the incidence of postoperative neurological complications was 4.1% after CVJ surgery; this rate was significantly greater in the MIOM change group than in the non-MIOM change group (21.7% vs. 0.8%; P < 0.01). Multiple regression analysis revealed that preoperative myelopathy, preoperative JOA score, and congenital anomaly/tumor were independently associated with MIOM changes during surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative neurological complications are not uncommon after CVJ surgery, and the incidence was significantly greater in the MIOM change group. Preoperative myelopathy, preoperative JOA score, and CVJ pathology related to congenital anomaly/tumor were independent risk factors for changes in MIOM data during surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes on the sagittal plane between anterior and posterior selective fusion (ASF and PSF) in patients with Lenke 5 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) for a minimum of 5 years of follow-up.
   METHODS: We included 77 patients with Lenke 5 AIS who underwent ASF (n = 40) with a single rod with structural cages or PSF (n = 37) with pedicle screw instrumentation. Radiographic parameters were compared preoperatively, 3 months and 2 years postoperatively, and at final follow-up.
   RESULTS: The mean follow-up duration was 93.9 +/- 21.4 months in the ASF group and 80.4 +/- 15.2 in the PSF group (P = 0.002). The correction rate of the coronal curve was comparable between the 2 groups at final follow-up. There was a significant time trend for lumbar lordosis (LL), thoracic kyphosis, thoracolumbar junctional kyphosis, instrumented segmental angle (ISA), proximal junctional angle, and sagittal vertical axis (P < 0.001) and significant group effects for LL (P = 0.0065) and ISA (P = 0.0325). At 3 months post-operatively, LL decreased in the ASF group and increased in the PSF group (-3.1 degrees +/- 6.6 degrees vs. 1.3 degrees +/- 5.5 degrees change, P = 0.002) and increased in both groups at final follow-up (2 degrees +/- 2.9 degrees vs. 4.3 degrees +/- 4.9 degrees change, P = 0.070). ISA increased in both groups 3 months postoperatively but decreased significantly in the ASF group compared with the PSF group at 2-year follow-up (4.0 degrees +/- 3.9 degrees vs. 0.7 degrees +/- 1.9 degrees change, P < 0.001) and final follow-up (8.1 degrees +/- 5.8 degrees vs. 0.8 degrees +/- 3.4 degrees change, P < 0.001). LL, ISA, and proximal junctional angle were significantly larger at final follow-up in the PSF group (P < 0.05). The incidence of proximal junctional kyphosis was higher in the PSF group (5/37) than in the ASF group (1/40).
   CONCLUSIONS: A significant and continuous loss of lordosis in ISA was observed after ASF in patients with Lenke 5 AIS. A larger LL was obtained with a higher incidence of proximal junctional kyphosis at long-term follow-up after PSF.

AB OBJECTIVE: Dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) at the petrous apex with pial arterial supplies possesses complicated angioarchitecture, associates with aggressive neurologic behaviors, and associates with high risk of complications. This study aimed to summarize our experience with this type of DAVF in the last 15 years.
   METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed 26 consecutive patients diagnosed with DAVFs of the petrous apex with pial arterial supplies from February 2002 to June 2017. Clinical information was extracted from medical records, radiographic data, intraoperative images, and complications and follow-up records.
   RESULTS: The 26 patients included 24 men and 2 women, with a mean age of 46.54 +/- 12.49 years (range, 28-73 years). Manifestations included nonhemorrhagic neurologic defects (19/26, 73.1%), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) (5/26, 19.2%), and no symptoms (2/26, 7.7%). Supratentorial draining direction was detected in 89.47% of the lesions, and 80% of the patients with venous ectasia had SAH. Complete occlusion was achieved in 21 patients (80.77%) through transarterial embolization and 5 patients (19.2%) through preoperative embolization combined with microsurgery. Complications included transient cranial nerve palsy in 1 patient (3.8%) and rebleeding in 2 patients (7.7%). The Barthel Index scores ranged from 10 to 100 (average, 66.73) and improved significantly (average, 96.62) in the follow-up period (10-175 months; median, 85.6 months).
   CONCLUSIONS: Supratentorial draining direction may be a risk factor for venous ectasia and SAH in petrous apex DAVFs with pial arterial supplies. The feeding pial arteries appeared to be at risk of embolization-related hemorrhagic complication and are therefore suggested to be embolized first.

AB OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord intramedullary cavernous malformation (SICM) is kind of rare vascular disease, and the therapeutic strategy is still under debate. The purpose of this article is to analyze outcome of SICM surgical resection and to find the possible factors indicating a better outcome.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 83 patients with SICM in a single center from 2005 to 2017 was performed. Neurologic status was assessed using the McCormick Scale. Clinical information was collected and analyzed using multivariate logistic regression analysis.
   RESULTS: Eighty patients with SICM were included, 48% of whom were male (n = 40). The mean age was 39.0 years; 7% of patients (n = 6) had a family history and 4% of patients (n = 3) had multiple lesions; and 41% (n = 34) were found with definite hemorrhage. Before surgery, neurologic status of the patients was 43.4%, 31.3%, 13.3%, and 12.0% in grades I (n = 36), II (n = 26), III (n = 11), and IV (n = 10), respectively. Sixty-three patients received long-term follow-up, of whom 19 improved, 39 remained in stable condition, and 5 deteriorated. Patients with duration of symptoms less than 3 months showed a higher improved outcome rate than those with duration longer than 3 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: The finding suggests that if total resection of SICM is achievable, surgical therapy could be considered to avoid risks of severe complications followed by lesion bleeding. Early microsurgical resection (usually within 3 months) for patients with SICM can lead to better clinical outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Hemodynamics plays an important role in aneurysm rupture. Microsurgical clipping provides the best chance to confirm the rupture point. The aim of this study was to explore the associations between the rupture point and hemodynamics.
   METHODS: Computational fluid dynamic simulations were performed on 16 intracranial aneurysms. The rupture point was detected at the time of clipping by 3 independent neurosurgeons. Hemodynamic parameters, including wall shear stress (WSS) and oscillatory shear index (OSI), were calculated at the rupture point and the whole aneurysm sac. Intra-aneurysmal flow patterns and flow impingement were also studied.
   RESULTS: The time-averaged WSS was 3.4855 +/- 3.8881 Pa at the aneurysm sac, which was significantly larger than that at the rupture point (1.5403 +/- 2.3688 Pa, P = 0.002). The OSI at the rupture point (0.0354 +/- 0.0459) was larger than at the sac (0.0220 +/- 0.0232) without difference. Thirteen aneurysms (81.3%) showed a complex flow pattern in the aneurysm sac; however, more than two thirds of the cases (68.7%) did not show a flow impact at the rupture point. Of these cases with daughter blebs, the rupture points were confirmed at the blebs in 6 cases. Two cases did not show association between blebs and rupture point.
   CONCLUSIONS: The hemodynamic characteristics at the rupture point were different from the aneurysm sac, and the WSS was significantly lower at the rupture point. Further study on the rupture risk assessment is still needed with more data and detailed information.

   OBSTRUCTION; DISTURBANCE
AB OBJECTIVE: Scoliosis, especially thoracic curves, causes poor pulmonary function. As a result, scoliosis may impair sleep breathing. The literature regarding the relationship between scoliosis and sleep breathing is sparse.
   METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis or congenital scoliosis and 25 healthy control subjects were included. The wrist sleep monitors was used. Sleep breathing was evaluated with the following parameters: 1) Respiratory Disorders Index (pRDI), indicating mean respiratory events per hour of sleep including apnea, hypoxia, and respiratory effort-related arousal; 2) Apnea and Hypopnea Index (pAHI), expressing the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep; and 3) mean and minimal oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) during sleep.
   RESULTS: No differences in age, sex distribution, and body mass index were found between the two groups. Patients with scoliosis had statistically significant higher pRDI (median, 10.10 vs. 8.65; P=0.039) and pAHI (median, 1.60 vs. 0.72; P=0.029) scores than the control group. The minimal SaO(2) value in patients with scoliosis was lower (median, 93% vs. 94%, respectively; P=0.005), whereas no difference was found in the mean SaO(2) value during sleep. In patients with scoliosis, pAHI scores were higher when lying on the convex side of the thoracic curve compared with the concave side (2.34 vs. 2.28, respectively; P = 0.044), whereas no such difference was observed in the control group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with scoliosis have more respiratory events of apnea and hypopnea during sleep than the control group. The minimal SaO(2) value in patients with scoliosis is lower than the normal population. Sleeping on the convex side of the thoracic curve results in higher pAHI scores than on the concave side.

AB OBJECTIVE: To correlate interpedicular distance (IPD) with radiographic parameters, neurologic deficit, and posterior structures injury in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures.
   METHODS: A total of 103 patients with a thoracolumbar burst fracture retrospectively reviewed. IPD was measured from the medial sclerotic areas of the pedicles on anteroposterior plain radiographs. Data on local kyphosis (LK), the ratio of anterior to posterior vertebral height (A/P ratio), loss of vertebral body height (LOVBH), spinal canal stenosis (SCS), neurologic status, and injuries to posterior structures (lamina, posterior ligamentous complex, and facet joint) were correlated with IPD using correlation analysis. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the threshold of IPD predictive of neurologic deficit and posterior structure injury.
   RESULTS: Of the 103 patients, 98 (95.15%) presented with increased IPD, ranging from 1.41% to 41.53% (mean, 10.92 +/- 3.37%). Regarding radiographic parameters, both LK and SCS were linearly correlated with IPD. There was a significant correlation between IPD and neurologic status; logistic regression analysis identified an IPD increase of > 20% as an indicator of neurologic deficit. In addition, both facet joint injury and lamina fracture were associated with IPD, with an IPD increase > 15% as an indicator of facet joint injury and an IPD increase > 20% a predictor of lamina fracture.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that IPD is correlated with LK, SCS, neurologic status, facet joint injury, and lamina fracture. Our data demonstrate that IPD measured from plain radiographs is a reliable indicator for assessment of thoracolumbar burst fractures.

TI Middle Meningeal Artery Embolization for Recurrent Chronic Subdural
   Hematoma: A Case Series
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Embolization; Interventional; Middle meningeal artery; Recurrence;
   Subdural hematoma
AB BACKGROUND: Embolization of the middle meningeal artery (MMA) has recently been proposed as an alternative to surgery for treatment of chronic subdural hematoma (SDH). There is increasing evidence that fragile neovasculature arising from distal branches of the MMA found within the membrane that forms around a chronic SDH is responsible for high recurrence rates due to chronic, repeated rebleeding. Embolization of the MMA could thus potentially eliminate the blood supply to this membrane and prevent further rebleeding.
   METHODS: The cases of 6 patients with 7 recurrent SDHs treated with MMA embolization with polyvinyl alcohol particles were retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS: MMA embolization was performed successfully in all 6 patients with no complications. Of the 7 SDHs treated, 1 required surgical reevacuation due to recurrence. The other 6 were able to avoid surgery, with reduction in size from 12 mm to 11 mm over 3 weeks, 14 mm to 9 mm over 9 weeks, 21 mm to 5 mm over 31 weeks, 17 mm to 9 mm over 12 weeks, 18 mm to 3 mm over 8 weeks, and 25 mm to 6 mm over 24 weeks. All patients had resolution of symptoms at longest follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this case series of 6 patients harboring 7 recurrent, chronic SDHs, 6 of the 7 were successfully treated with MMA embolization and able to avoid surgery for reevacuation, suggesting that this minimally invasive technique may represent an effective alternative to surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: To detect cerebral autoregulation (CA) in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) by near-infrared spectroscopy and to assess its association with delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI).
   METHODS: From January to August 2017, 81 patients (average age 53.25 +/- 10.27 years) were studied. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor CA, and associated factors were evaluated. Monitoring of CA was carried out at 5 time points (preoperative day 1 and postoperative days 1, 2, 3, and 7). Patients were sorted into 2 groups according to whether DCI occurred (DCI group and non-DCI group). The relationship between CA and DCI in patients with aSAH was analyzed.
   RESULTS: Among 81 patients, CA trended toward being impaired in patients with aSAH with a poorer grade. DCI occurred in 39 of 51 (48.15%) patients with impaired CA. DCI occurred in 6 of 30 (7.4%) patients with intact CA.
   CONCLUSIONS: Impaired CA monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy was shown in patients with aSAH before and after surgical intervention. Older age, smoking, hypertension, and especially impaired CA are independent risk factors for patients with DCI.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify potential prognostic factors of hemifacial spasm (HFS) after microvascular decompression (MVD), to establish the appropriate way to tackle postprocedure symptoms and complications (PPSCs), and to find the incidence and duration of PPSCs.
   METHODS: Two hundred and forty-eight patients with HFS were monitored between December 2009 and December 2014. The mean follow-up duration was 24 months (range, 6-67 months). We divided patients based on their PPSC status and investigated the following factors: age, sex, spasm side, facial nerve block before MVD (botulinum toxin treatment), acupuncture before MVD, duration of HFS, hypertension, diabetes, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection status, herpes simplex virus infection status, smoking status and alcohol use, offending vessels, Chiari malformation, electrophysiologic monitoring results, and postoperative HFS. Univariable analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to find potential risk factors. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to show the duration of postprocedure facial palsy.
   RESULTS: Age (odds ratio [OR], 1.037; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.004-1.072; P = 0.03) and HBV status (OR, 18.256; 95% CI, 2.723-122.415; P = 0.03) were positive predictors of PPSCs. Postoperative HFS (OR, 0.249; 95% CI, 0.084-0.0739; P = 0.012) may be a protective factor for postprocedure facial palsy. Most PPSCs related to cranial nerves recovered spontaneously in 3 months. Infections and cerebrospinal fluid leakages were controlled by medical intervention in 1-2 weeks. The permanent complication rate was only 4.8%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of PPSCs after MVD is very high, most PPSCs related to cranial nerves recovered spontaneously in several days. Permanent complications after MVD for HFS are rare. Age may relate to the occurrence of PPSCs, and postoperative HFS may be a protective factor for patients with facial palsy after MVD.

AB OBJECTIVE: Spinal dermoid cysts are uncommon tumors, and their spontaneous rupture into the syrinx cavity alone is extremely rare. The treatment strategy for this condition has not been described.
   METHODS: We report 4 patients with lumbar spinal dermoid cysts and spontaneous rupture. The ruptured contents were all located at the cervicothoracic intramedullary section, leading to a lipid syrinx. There were 2 male and 2 female patients, with ages ranging from 23 to 36 years old (median 30 years).
   RESULTS: The main preoperative complaints of 3 patients were associated with the cervicothoracic syrinx, and syrinx aspiration surgery was performed. Two of those patients underwent subsequent lumbar dermoid cyst resection surgery. The fourth patient's initial complaint was caused by the lumbar dermoid cyst; thus, tumor resection surgery was performed first. Years after surgery, the fourth patient also presented with symptoms associated with the cervicothoracic intramedullary lipid syrinx, and syrinx aspiration surgery also was conducted. All patients had good recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Staging operations should be considered according to the patient's symptoms. Syrinx aspiration surgery is an effective treatment for the symptomatic lipid syrinx.

   EXPERIENCE
AB BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of brainstem cavernous malformations (CMs) remains a great challenge for neurosurgeons. Several cases published in the literature have addressed surgical approaches. However, no surgical approach has been reported to provide better exposure for CMs located in the superior midbrain.
   METHODS: We presented 10 cases of superior midbrain CMs in children treated in Beijing Tiantan Hospital from 2002 to 2016. The most common presenting signs and symptoms were hydrocephalus and cranial nerve deficit. We used the transcallosal anterior interforniceal approach in all patients to remove the CM lesion.
   RESULTS: Total resection was achieved in all patients. During the follow-up period, temporary short-term memory impairment was present in 5 patients, unilateral ptosis occurred in 1 patient, and upward gaze dysfunction occurred in 2 patients. There was complete neurologic functional improvement for cranial nerves. Exacerbation of hydrocephalus occurred in 4 patients requiring additional ventriculoperitoneal shunt postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The transcallosal anterior interforniceal approach can provide good exposure and direct visualization to superior midbrain CMs. Complications are shortterm and reversible.

AB OBJECTIVE: Tumor recurrence or residual regrowth are poor prognoses for pituitary adenoma (PA). However, there is no validated and well-accepted prognostic classification of PAs to predict the clinical outcome and guide clinical practice. We analyzed the relevant data of a large cohort of patients with PA and thereafter proposed a new clinicopathologic classification for prognostic prediction.
   METHODS: Tumor recurrence or residual regrowth identified by magnetic resonance imaging scans and endocrine studies were analyzed along with associated clinical and pathological characteristics for patients who underwent surgery in 2008-2016 at West China Hospital. A new clinicopathologic classification was proposed and applied.
   RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 44.0 months, tumor recurrence and residual progression were identified in 48 (25.0%) and 29 (37.2%) patients, respectively. Proliferative potential (hazard ratio [HR], 2.188; P = 0.002), invasiveness (HR, 1.698; P = 0.029), larger tumor size (HR, 1.029; P = 0.004), high-risk PA subtype (HR, 2.151; P = 0.004), and postoperative residual (HR, 1.941; P = 0.007) were risk factors for recurrence/progression in the early stage after surgery. With respect to clinicopathologic classification, compared with grade 1a tumors, grade 1b, 2a, and 2b adenomas had poorer prognosis with an increased probability of tumor recurrence/progression of 5.133-fold, 4.467-fold, and 20.1-fold, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The proposed clinicopathologic classification of PAs showed significant value in predicting prognosis and succeeded in identifying cases with more clinically aggressive lesions with recurrence or residual regrowth. This prognostic classification may be helpful when identifying aggressive PAs and deciding the appropriate therapeutic strategy for patients with PAs.

AB BACKGROUND: Delayed cerebral vasospasm is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This study aimed to assess the effects of Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) on delayed cerebral vasospasm after SAH.
   METHODS: A rat model of SAH was established by puncturing one side of the internal carotid artery. Then, rats received daily intraperitoneal injections of AS-IV (20 mg/kg; SAH-AS-IV group), 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (SAH-DMSO group), or saline (SAH group) for 5 days; an additional control group consisted of rats receiving sham surgery and saline injections. Morphologic characteristics of the basilar artery (BA) were measured from histologic sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin and used as indicators of cerebral vasospasm. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) p65 protein levels in the BA. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the plasma concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6.
   RESULTS: Compared with controls, the SAH-DMSO and SAH groups showed increased wall thickness and reduced luminal cross-sectional area (indicative of vasospasm) and increased TLR4 expression and enhanced NF-kB activation in the BA, as well as elevated plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6. Administration of AS-IV was associated with significant attenuation of all the aforementioned changes induced by SAH (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: AS-IV may attenuate delayed cerebral vasospasm after SAH through inhibition of TLR4/NF-kappa B-mediated inflammatory signaling pathways.

DE Consent; Pituitary; Surgery; Transsphenoidal
AB OBJECTIVE: The results of recent high-profile delict and medical negligence cases now require doctors to take "reasonable care to ensure that the patient is aware of any material risks involved in any recommended treatment, and of any reasonable alternative or variant treatments." Thus, we report the development and evaluation of a procedure-specific online educational resource to support the informed consent process for patients undergoing transsphenoidal excision of pituitary adenomas.
   METHODS: An interactive educational multimedia website was developed using a combination of text, images, and videos. A telephone questionnaire was devised to evaluate patients' understanding that included 15 true/false questions. The questionnaire was administered to separate cohorts of patients on the waiting list for transsphenoidal excision of a pituitary adenoma before and after introduction of the website. The patients were also asked to rate the extent to which they found the website easy to understand and useful on a 10-point Likert scale. Data were compared using the chi(2) and Mann-Whitney U test, with P < 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance.
   RESULTS: Ten consecutive patients completed the questionnaire before the introduction of the website and nine afterward. The median questionnaire scores were significantly greater after the introduction of the website (14 of 15 vs. 12 of 15; P=0.002), and all patients subjectively found the website easy to understand and useful (10 of 10 in both groups).
   CONCLUSIONS: An interactive educational multimedia website appears to be a helpful adjunct to the informed consent process for patients undergoing transsphenoidal excision of a pituitary adenoma.

AB OBJECTIVE: Intracranial meningiomas are the most commonly diagnosed brain tumor in the United States. With increasing incidence, efficient allocation of limited health care resources is a critical component of emerging value-based models of care. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of patient and hospital variables on metrics of value-based care.
   METHODS: The Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System database was queried for records of patients undergoing intracranial meningioma surgery in New York State from 1995 to 2015. Multivariate logistic regression was used to investigate the effect of hospital volume and patient demographics on 30-day readmissions, 30-day mortality, prolonged length of stay (pLOS), and excess hospital charges.
   RESULTS: Among the 14,239 patients included, 10,252 (72%) cases were performed at high-volume centers (HVC) (> 75th percentile). HVC were associated with lower rates of readmissions, mortality, and pLOS, but higher hospital charges. In the multivariate analysis, HVC had reduced odds of pLOS (odds ratio, 0.56; P < 0.0001) and 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 0.39; P < 0.0001). Patient variables associated with adverse outcomes in the multivariate model included advanced age, male gender, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, lower socioeconomic status (low income, Medicaid, and Medicare insurance), black race, and Hispanic ethnicity. These populations were more likely to undergo treatment at lower-volume centers.
   CONCLUSIONS: This statewide population analysis of readmissions, mortality, length of stay, and hospital charges after intracranial meningioma surgery identified patient predictors of adverse outcomes. These determinants may be used by hospitals to develop improved systems of care in at-risk populations.

AB INTRODUCTION: Autonomic nervous system dysfunction is a known entity in strokes involving insula. It causes significant morbidity and mortality. No study to date has demonstrated autonomic nervous system dysfunction in patients with insular glioma. This is an exploratory study to identify the subclinical autonomic dysfunctions in insular glioma.
   METHODS: A total 50 patients with newly diagnosed insular glioma in the age group of 18-60 years were evaluated with heart rate variability (HRV). All the HRV parameters in patients with insular glioma were compared with normal healthy age- and sex-matched control patients.
   RESULTS: There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in most of the HRV parameters between patients and control patients. Patients with left insular glioma showed significantly increased heart rate (P = 0.027), low-frequency normalized units (P = 0.048), and also increased low-frequency/high-frequency ratio (P = 0.015), which indicates sympathetic dominance. Patients with seizures had significantly lower values of total power (P = 0.042). No significant difference was found in terms of the extent and size of the tumor or histopathologic grades of gliomas.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with insular gliomas have significant impairment of autonomic functions, with left insular glioma showing sympathetic dominance. Suppression of autonomic function is greater in those presenting with seizures.

AB OBJECTIVE: Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is a highly recurrent disorder. Although some predictors including the use of antithrombotic agents such as aspirin and warfarin have been proposed, the pathogenic mechanism involved remains unclear. Moreover, the link between direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) agent use and CSDH recurrence has not been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate factors including DOAC use that could potentially be associated with CSDH recurrence.
   METHODS: The authors analyzed 787 patients with CSDH who underwent surgery for CSDH with 1 burr-hole irrigation at Baba Memorial Hospital from January 2012 to November 2017. The patients were divided into recurrence and nonrecurrence groups and anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and control groups. Recurrence was defined as ipsilateral hemorrhage within 90 days from the original operation. Variables with P < 0.1 in the univariate analysis were included in a multivariate logistic regression model.
   RESULTS: CSDH recurrence was observed in 12.2% of patients, and significantly more men (80.2%) than women experienced recurrence. Age, sex, and warfarin use were entered in the multivariate analysis, and it was revealed that age and male sex were independently associated with CSDH recurrence. Antithrombotic agent use including use of DOACs was not associated with increased CSDH recurrence.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present study found that age and male sex were independently associated with CSDH recurrence, while the use of antithrombotic agents was not.

   METAANALYSIS; PREDICTORS; OUTCOMES
AB OBJECTIVE: Of cavernous malformations (CMs) treated with radiosurgery (RS), 5% bleed after 2-year initial latency period. This rate is similar to failure rate of RS for other pathologies, which often require repeat RS for favorable outcome. The aim of this pilot study was to define failure of CM RS and to assess safety of second RS.
   METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed of 7 of 345 CMs retreated with RS; 6 CMs were deep-seated, and 1 was superficial. Median time between the 2 treatments was 8 years (range, 3-16 years), and median follow-up time after second RS was 3 years (range, 1-9 years).
   RESULTS: Following the 2-year latency period after RS, 6% of deep-seated and 5% of hemispheric CMs, and 6% of deep-seated and 2% of hemispheric lesions caused transient neurologic deficits without hemorrhage. A second treatment was indicated for rebleed in 5 cases and for recurrent transient neurologic deficits in 2 cases. Prescribed dose was 15 Gy (range, 12-20 Gy) at first treatment and 12 Gy (range, 12-18 Gy) at second treatment. Target volumes were 692 mm(3) (range, 54-2400 mm(3)) and 935 mm(3) (range, 150-1550 mm(3)) at first and second treatments, respectively, and treatment volumes were 811 mm(3) (range, 79-2500 mm(3)) and 962 mm(3) (range, 194-1750 mm(3)), respectively. Differences in treatment parameters were not significant. Reason for failure was inaccurate target definition in only 2 cases. There were no bleeds, morbidity, or mortality after second RS.
   CONCLUSIONS: Second RS applied to previously treated CMs is safe and may be effective. Further investigations are needed to verify these findings and assess long-term benefit of second RS.

   DOUBLE-BLIND; SOMATOSTATIN RECEPTOR; SLEEVE-GASTRECTOMY; SHORT-TERM
AB OBJECTIVE: Craniopharyngiomas (CPs) and their treatment are associated with hypothalamic damage that causes hypothalamic obesity (HO) in 30% e70% of cases. Thus, there is ongoing research regarding tangible solutions for HO, because these patients have unrelenting resistance to basic weight-loss interventions. This review aims to summarize the interventions that are used to treat CP-related HO (CP-HO), including pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery.
   METHODS: The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and PubMed databases were searched up to June 2017 for relevant reports. Two reviewers conducted independent evaluations of the studies identified.
   RESULTS: Eighteen articles were included in the systematic review, with 3 reports describing pharmacotherapy in randomized controlled trials and 15 reports describing bariatric surgery. Although several studies described effective interventions for treating CP-HO, the evidence base was limited by its low quality and our inability to perform a meta-analysis, which was related to a lack of adequate or integrated data.
   CONCLUSIONS: Octreotide appears to be a preferred treatment for patients with CP-HO, based on limited data. Gastric bypass surgery may also be suitable for select patients with CP-HO, based on a review of various procedures in this setting. Microsurgical preservation of the hypothalamic structures is mandatory to decrease CP-HO-related morbidity and mortality. Further studies with adequate analytical power and sufficient follow-up are needed to identify effective strategies for CP-HO treatment.

AB OBJECTIVE: Postoperative hyperperfusion is an important complication after direct bypass for moyamoya disease, which sometimes occurs late after initial postoperative cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurement. This study aimed to clarify the incidence of hyperperfusion with management using postoperative continuous sedation and repeated postoperative CBF measurement and to identify factors associated with delayed hyperperfusion.
   METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated 72 consecutive hemispheres in 56 adult Japanese patients with moyamoya disease who underwent direct bypass. Postoperative continuous sedation was routinely administered based on CBF evaluation. First, the incidence of symptomatic hyperperfusion was investigated. Second, radiologic hyperperfusion (RHP), which was strictly defined as >30% increase in CBF compared with the contralateral side, and factors associated with delayed RHP were statistically analyzed.
   RESULTS: Postoperative symptomatic hyperperfusion occurred in 3 hemispheres (4.2%), including subarachnoid hemorrhage in 1 hemisphere (1.4%). RHP immediately after surgery was identified in 16 hemispheres (22.2%). In 8 hemispheres (11.1%), RHP appeared or worsened several days after initial CBF study. In univariate logistic regression analysis, decreased preoperative cerebral vaso-reactivity was significantly associated with delayed RHP.
   CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of symptomatic hyperperfusion was 4.2% with management. Delayed hyperperfusion was significantly associated with decreased cerebral vasoreactivity. Therefore, repeated CBF measurements evaluating preoperative cerebral vasoreactivity may decrease complications.

ID SPONTANEOUS INTRACRANIAL HYPOTENSION
AB OBJECTIVE: The effects of large-volume epidural blood patch (EBP) remain unclear in patients with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. We report excellent outcomes from 15 consecutive CSF leak cases that underwent a large-volume EBP using an intravenous catheter from a single lumbar entry point, together with outcomes from 4 patients who underwent direct surgical closure or drip-and-rest therapy during the same period.
   METHODS: Nineteen patients with idiopathic CSF leaks were enrolled in this study since November 2011 (12 women; mean age, 43.3 +/- 14.0 years). Patient demographic data, radiologic findings, symptoms, administrated therapies, complications, and clinical courses were investigated retrospectively.
   RESULTS: Different types of headache were observed, including typical orthostatic headache alone (n = 10), orthostatic headache with chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) (n = 3), and posture-unrelated headache accompanied with CSDH (n = 6). Regarding treatments, in 1 case, direct surgical closure was performed. In 15 cases, large-volume EBPs were performed, and the volume of injected blood was 44.8 +/- 21.6 mL. The other 3 cases were treated by simple drip infusion regardless of the drainage for CSDH. Out of 9 cases with accompanied CSDH, recurrence of subdural hematoma was completely prevented by the application of an EBP after drainage in 5 cases and without drainage in 3 cases, and by simple intravenous drip-and-rest therapy after drainage in 1 case. Among 10 patients suffering from typical orthostatic headache alone, symptoms disappeared completely in 7 cases and were relieved in 3 cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate here a perfect control of spinal CSF leaks with the administration of a large-volume EBP through an intravenous catheter.

AB BACKGROUND: There is a need to further anatomically describe the nucleus accumbens (NA), as there is a growing neurosurgical interest in this locus but a limited understanding of its structure. In this study, we evaluated quantitative NA parameters and spatial relationships with adjacent structures found in the telencephalon.
   METHODS: A total of 155 NA specimens from coronal sections and 3 NA specimens from transverse sections were stained using the Mulligan technique as modified by Barnard et al. The distance from the NA to other structures was then measured.
   RESULTS: The mean radius of the 155 NAs in the coronal sections was 6.23 +/- 0.964 mm, averaging 8.99 +/- 2.02 mm from midline (coordinate x), 27.09 +/- 3.15 mm from the insula, 12.95 +/- 3.21 mm from the outer border of the putamen, 10.52 +/- 2.66 mm from the upper border of the caudate, and 8.84 +/- 2.93 mm from the midline of the lateral ventricle. The mean distance from the NA center of gravity to the middle of the intercommissural line parallel to the midline (coordinate y) was 17.08 +/- 3.61 mm, and the mean vertical distance from the intercommissural line to the NA was 8.12 +/- 1.265 mm.
   CONCLUSIONS: We obtained the stereotactic coordinates of (x, y, z) =(8, 17, -8) for the NA. From this and other delineations of the described position of the NA, it is possible to contribute to stereotactic surgical atlases, improving neurosurgical interventions in this structure.

AB INTRODUCTION: Meckel's cave is a dural-lined cavity in the middle fossa skull base in which lies the Gasserian ganglion, a potential site for tumors and inflammatory lesions. A variety of lesions can be predominantly isolated to Meckel's cave, including extension from head and neck cancers, other malignant tumors, as well as benign lesions. Clinical presentation and imaging findings are often insufficient to establish a diagnosis. Hence, histologic confirmation is required to determine the appropriate treatment strategy. Several surgical approaches have been used to reach this deep-seated area, often with significant morbidity and prolonged recovery. Given advancements in endoscopy and greater facility with the technique, the endoscopic endonasal approach has been used increasingly to reach lesions in the region.
   METHODS: A single-institution, retrospective chart review over a 10-year period was performed to identify and describe patients with pathologically differing but imaging-similar lesions with their epicenter in Meckel's cave.
   RESULTS: Of a total of 21 cases of lesions in Meckel's cave approached by an endoscopic endonasal transpterygoid approach, we present 6 patients with imaging-ambiguous lesions involving Meckel's cave that were biopsied via the extended endoscopic endonasal approach. Among this diverse group, pathology included B-cell lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, malignant schwannoma, benign schwannoma, and neurosarcoidosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: We explore not only the relevance of this approach in the armamentarium of the modern skull-base surgeon but also its limitations and conclude that the endoscopic endonasal approach provides a safe and relatively direct, minimally invasive corridor to many lesions of Meckel's cave.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze serum levels of S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and interleukin (IL)-6 in pediatric patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to assess their relationship with clinical outcome.
   METHODS: To measure biomarkers, peripheral venous blood was collected within 6 hours and 1 week after TBI. Initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores and Glasgow Outcome Scale scores 6 months after the trauma were used to evaluate clinical outcome.
   RESULTS: Median serum levels of S100B (178.12 pg/mL), NSE (16.54 ng/mL), and IL-6 (15.48 pg/mL) at admission decreased significantly 1 week after TBI to 40.86 pg/mL, 5.85 ng/mL, and 8.63 pg/mL. In the group with poor GCS scores, serum S100B and NSE levels both at admission and 1 week after TBI were significantly higher than levels in the group with good GCS scores. Serum S100B and NSE levels 1 week after injury in patients with unfavorable 6-month outcomes were significantly higher than levels 1 week after injury in patients with favorable outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Serum levels of S100B, NSE, and IL-6 decreased 1 week after injury. Serum levels of S100B and NSE at admission were related to initial GCS scores, and these levels 1 week after TBI were related to 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale scores. Thus, serial measurements of serum S100B and NSE, but not IL-6, may help assess brain damage and clinical outcome of pediatric patients with TBI.

AB OBJECTIVE: There is no previous reports available on stent-assisted coiling of ruptured multiple intracranial aneurysms using single Low-Profile Visualized Intraluminal Support (LVIS) in one stage. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy and feasibility of using single LVIS to bridge multiple intracranial aneurysms in one stage.
   METHODS: From April 2014 to August 2016, 24 patients treated with single LVIS to bridge 2 aneurysms in one stage were reviewed. The aneurysm morphology, clinical outcome, angiographic results, progressive occlusion, recurrence, and procedure-related complications were analyzed retrospectively.
   RESULTS: In the present study, middle term clinical outcome showed that 9 patients were had a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0, 11 patients had mRS 1, and 4 patients had mRS 2. A total of 20 patients (83.3%) achieved a good outcome, 4 patients (16.7%) had poor outcomes, and 7 of 18 patients (38.9%) displayed improved clinical neurologic status in long-term follow-up. Immediate angiographic results postprocedure showed Raymond Scale (RS) I in 33 aneurysms (68.8%), RS II in 11 aneurysms (22.9%), and RS III in 4 aneurysms (8.3%). The angiographic follow-up results showed RS I in 41 aneurysms (85.4%), RS II in 5 aneurysms (10.4%), and RS III in 2 aneurysms (4.2%). Of 15 incomplete occlusion aneurysms postprocedure, 10 aneurysms (66.7%) achieved to progressed occlusion on follow-up imaging, and no recanalization or mortality occurred in this group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Single LVIS bridging wide-neck ruptured multiple intracranial aneurysms was effective and feasible in one stage. However, the procedure-related complications should be emphasized and long-term follow-up requires further evaluation.

AB BACKGROUND: The Meckel's cave (MC) is commonly affected by neoplastic lesions that often require neurosurgical treatment. We simulated the posterior petrous apicectomy (PPA) on fresh cadavers to verify the in vivo feasibility of the approach. We proposed a new classification system of MC meningioma based on the extent of middle cranial fossa (MCF) involvement.
   METHODS: Ten fresh, noneformalin-fixed specimens were used in this study. Through a retrosigmoid approach, 20 PPAs were performed. Subsequently, the cerebral hemispheres were removed to quantify the MCF exposure and dimensions of the suprameatal tubercle. Twenty-four patients operated on for MC meningioma were classified as follows: group 1, tumor <3 cm; group 2, tumor >3 cm. Group 2 was subdivided into to 5 subtypes: 2A, tumor of the MCF; 2B, tumor of the posterior cranial fossa; 2C, tumor of MCF and posterior cranial fossa; 2C type I, MCF <15 mm; and 2C type II, MCF >15 mm.
   RESULTS: The extent of MCF exposure through the PPA is 13 mm. Mean suprameatal tubercle dimensions were 10.4 mm x 3.8 mm. Mean extent of bony removal for the PPA was 10.2 mm. PPA was successfully performed in 3 patients without major neurologic sequelae.
   CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results obtained with the PPA in 2C type I meningiomas are encouraging. The new classification system proposed can be useful in clinical practice, especially in the choice of the most suitable surgical approach for dumbbell meningiomas.

DT Article
DE Atlantoaxial dislocation; C2 ganglion; C2 nerve root; Congenital;

ID MASS SCREW FIXATION; GANGLION
AB OBJECTIVE: Deliberate C2 nerve root sectioning and its preservation have been described during posterior fusion for atlantoaxial dislocation (AAD). However, the associated outcomes have been less studied, especially in congenital AAD. Our objective was to study the clinical outcomes after C2 nerve root sectioning and the feasibility of C2 preservation in these patients.
   METHODS: The data from 190 patients were retrospectively studied. The decision to cut or preserve the C2 nerve root was determined by the preoperative radiologic findings and intraoperative suitability of its preservation. During follow-up, the patients were questioned about C2 nerve-related dysfunction. The pros and cons of sectioning or preservation of the C2 nerve root and the related feasibility factors are also described.
   RESULTS: Complex C1-C2 anatomy that required extensive dissection and drilling was seen in 139 patients. After C2 nerve root sectioning in 178 patients, none reported bothersome hypoesthesia, paresthesia, or dysesthesia that required medication. However, 9 patients (5.1%) developed nonhealing occipital ulcers and most required flap coverage or a skin graft. C2 nerve root preservation is feasible with an adequate inferior C1 lateral mass and normal-size ganglion. In patients with C1-occipital condyle hypoplasia, extremely oblique joints, spondyloptosis, incurved occiput, pseudofacets, and anomalous vertebral artery, preservation of the C2 nerve root is difficult.
   CONCLUSIONS: The advantages of sectioning the C2 nerve root are many. However, a subset of patients is prone to morbid occipital neuropathic ulcers. After C2 nerve sectioning, one should be cautious of such complications. C2 nerve root preservation should be strongly considered for patients with favorable anatomy.

ID NONFUNCTIONING PITUITARY-ADENOMAS; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; FOLLOW-UP; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Elderly patients with acromegaly who have comorbidities may increasingly encounter perioperative complications; however, little data are available on the risks and outcomes of surgical treatment in these patients. We aimed to analyze and compare the results of transnasal transsphenoidal surgery (TTS) in elderly and younger patients.
   METHODS: Eighty-seven consecutive patients with acromegaly who underwent TTS were included. We divided the patients into elderly (>= 65 years) and younger (< 65 years) groups and compared clinical characteristics, anesthesia risk, and surgical outcomes in these 2 groups.
   RESULTS: The 87 patients included 24 (27.6%) in the elderly group and 63 (73.4%) in the younger group. Preoperative endocrinologic and radiologic assessments showed no significant differences between the 2 groups. Although a grade 3 American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status classification was more common in the elderly group (75% vs. 3%; P = 0.00001) owing to the severity of associated diseases, no significant between-group difference in perioperative complications was seen (17% vs. 6%; P = 0.142). Sixteen elderly patients and 45 younger patients achieved endocrinologic remission following surgery (67% vs. 71%; P = 0.426). The incidence rate of postoperative new pituitary deficit was similar in the elderly and younger groups (4% vs. 3%; P = 0.625). Approximately one-third of the elderly patients with diagnosed hypertension or diabetes mellitus tapered their medication after successful tumor removal.
   CONCLUSIONS: TTS can be considered a safe treatment for both younger and elderly patients with acromegaly. Successful tumor removal provided a significant improvement in comorbidities even in elderly patients with acromegaly.

AB BACKGROUND: The benefits of early surgical decompression and stabilisation (within 24 hours of injury) for patients with acute traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is unclear. The study objective was to investigate the effects of early (<24 hours of injury) versus late (>24 hours of injury) decompressive and stabilisation surgery for traumatic cervical SCI in patients with concomitant chest injuries.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective study including adults aged 16 years or over with traumatic cervical SCI, Glasgow Coma Scale score >13, and concomitant chest injuries (e.g. hemopneumothoraces, flail chest and pulmonary contusions) necessitating intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Forty patients who met the inclusion criteria and underwent decompressive surgery within 24 hours were compared with 55 patients who underwent decompressive surgery after 24 hours. Primary outcomes were ordinal change in the ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) at 6 months and duration of ICU stay. Secondary outcomes included complications occurring within 30 days.
   RESULTS: In the early surgery group, 21 patients (52.5%) showed no improvement in ASIA grade, 13 (32.5%) had a 1-grade improvement, and 6 (15%) had a 2-grade improvement. The median length of ICU stay was 14 days (range, 2-68). 42.5% of patients developed a complication and 45% required a tracheostomy. In the late surgery group, AIS grade improvement was as follows: 32 (58%) no improvement, 19 (34.5%) had a 1 grade improvement, 3 (5.5%) had a 2 grade improvement and 1 (2%) had a 3 grade improvement. Mean ICU stay was 23 days (4-68). 53% of patients developed a complication and 55% required a tracheostomy. There was one mortality in the late surgery group.
   CONCLUSIONS: For patients with acute traumatic cervical SCI and concomitant chest trauma, early surgical decompression and stabilisation was associated with reduced ICU stay and a lower complication rate. Neurological recovery was more likely in younger patients and those with an incomplete SCI.

AB OBJECTIVES: To investigate the extent of spinal cord compression and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space after T9 paddle lead spinal cord stimulation (SCS) using three-dimensional myelographic computed tomography scans.
   METHODS: Preoperative and postoperative three-dimensional myelographic computed tomography scans were performed in 15 patients with paddle lead SCS at T9 for neuropathic back and leg pain. Four axial levels between each row of the electrodes were selected and the cross-sectional areas of thecal sac and spinal cord, the width of anterior and posterior CSF space, and contact angle of the lead within T9 spinal canal were measured with 12-month pain relief assessment.
   RESULTS: The cross-sectional areas of thecal sac and spinal cord under each contact of paddle leads decreased significantly (23.89 +/- 11.48% and 9.45 +/- 4.80%; P < 0.05, respectively). The width of posterior CSF space decreased by 38.65 +/- 20.97% and that of anterior CSF space showed a greater reduction by 59.09 +/- 18.39% (P < 0.05). We achieved a mean pain relief of 45.49 +/- 13.73% at 12-month follow-up and found a significant correlation with percentage reduction in the area of the spinal cord.
   CONCLUSIONS: Significant reduction in the cross-sectional area of spinal cord and anterior CSF space as well as thecal sac and posterior CSF space resulted in deformation of the spinal cord under paddle leads at T9 within 7 postoperative days. Close approximation to the dorsal column and the mass effect of paddle leads may determine the clinical outcome of paddle lead SCS and also raise safety concerns.

ID QUALITY-OF-LIFE; NONOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT; DISABILITY INDEX; FOLLOW-UP;
   SCOLIOSIS; MULTICENTER; FUSION; AGE
AB BACKGROUND: In an era of rising health care costs, it is prudent to consider effective use of resources. Given the rapidly expanding elderly population with an anticipated increase in adult spinal deformity, identifying the significant cost drivers for the surgical management is an important step in the process of increasing sustainability and cost-effectiveness of adult spinal deformity surgery.
   METHODS: A total of 129 patients undergoing elective spine surgery for thoraco-lumbar deformity were enrolled in a prospective longitudinal registry. Patient-reported resource use during the 3-month postoperative period, including outpatient visits, spine-related diagnostic tests, injections, emergency department room visits, rehabilitation/skilled nursing facility utilization, and use of all medications, was collected in a single-center prospective registry. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to find the significant patient coefficient for the cost variability.
   RESULTS: The study population showed significant improvement (P < 0.001) in all patient-reported outcomes including disability (Oswestry Disability Index), pain (Numeric Rating Scale for Back Pain and Numeric Rating Scale for Leg Pain), and quality of life (Euro-Qol-5D). In risk-adjusted multiple patient comorbidities including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes, preoperative deformity diagnosis, number of levels involved, length of surgery and hospital stay, 90-day readmission and use of inpatient rehabilitation were the significant drivers of the cost.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that several patient-specific, surgery-related factors, 90-day readmission and postdischarge inpatient rehabilitation use, were associated with increased cost associated with the adult deformity spine surgery.

DE Computed tomography; Glasgow Coma Scale; Intracerebral contusion; Mild
   head trauma; Subarachnoid hemorrhage; Subdural hematoma
ID COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; BRAIN-INJURY; INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE; UTILITY
AB BACKGROUND: Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is among the most common causes of emergency admission. Current guidelines have clearly evidenced risk factors and neurologic signs that should suggest computed tomography (CT) of the head at admission and indications for the first repeated CT scan. However, the role and frequency of further repeated CT scans after an initially positive scan are still unclear.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 222 patients admitted in our hospital for clinical observation after an MTBI and a positive initial scan. Repeated CT scans were categorized according to timing from the first scan. All the scans were evaluated for the presence of posttraumatic lesions. We classified the data in 3 groups according to the timing of CT scans: A (CT scans at t0-t12-t24), B (t0-t12-t48), and C (t0-t24-t48). Differences in worsening or stability of posttraumatic lesions were compared by the chi(2) test.
   RESULTS: 146 CT scans were performed at t12, 81 at t24, and 143 at t48. The initial CT scan was positive for epidural hematoma in 17 cases, subdural hematoma in 106, subdural hygroma in 10, intracerebral contusion in 110, subarachnoid hemorrhage in 109, and intraventricular hemorrhage in 12. None of the posttraumatic lesions showed significant worsening or at the first or second CT scan in any of the 3 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of patients in clinically stable condition with an MTBI and posttraumatic intracranial lesions at initial CT scan has been shown to minimally benefit from repeated CT scans. Given neurologic stability, a control scan can be safely delayed up to 48 hours to avoid unnecessary scans.

AB OBJECTIVES: Patients with large vestibular schwannomas (VSs) will require surgical treatment owing to the potential consequences of long tract and cranial nerve compression. We assessed the long-term clinical and radiologic outcomes of patients harboring large VSs treated with a facial nerve (FN)-sparing technique.
   METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study of 169 consecutive large VSs treated surgically from January 2003 to May 2015. The postoperative volume of the tumor residue was assessed using thin-slice magnetic resonance imaging 6 months after surgery. Postoperatively, the patients were allocated to a wait and rescan (W&reS) or an upfront gamma knife surgery (GKS) policy.
   RESULTS: At the last follow-up examination, FN function was good (House-Brackmann grade I or II) in 84% of the patients. Of the 169 patients, 11% had undergone gross total resection, 59% near total, 21% subtotal, and 9% partial resection. In the 143 patients without gross total resection, the overall median tumor residue volume was 0.39 cm(3). Of these 143 patients, 66 had been allocated to the W&reS policy and 77 to upfront GKS. Overall tumor control was achieved in 83% of cases, with a mean follow-up of 62 months. Of the 27 growing residues, 17 required salvage treatment (11% failure rate). The 1-, 5-, and 7-year progression-free survival rate was 95%, 82%, and 76% in the W&reS group and 99%, 81%, and 78% in the GKS group, respectively (P = 0.57).
   CONCLUSIONS: Functional nerve-sparing resection provides satisfactory FN preservation. The low probability of long-term regrowth of small remnants is an argument for a W&reS protocol. GKS is a legitimate option for salvage treatment.

AB OBJECTIVE: To review the results of sphenoid sinus lateral recess (SSLR) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks treated with the endoscopic endonasal minimal transpterygoid approach (EEMTPA) and to discuss the surgical technique and outcomes.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 13 cases who underwent SSLR CSF leak repair through the EEMTPA in our clinic between September 2008 and December 2017. Demographic and etiological features with reconstruction and surgical outcomes were examined. Mean follow-up time was 6.1 years.
   RESULTS: In regard to etiology, the SSLR CSF leaks included 9 patients with spontaneous, 2 patients with traumatic, and 2 with iatrogenic causes. CSF leak was at the left lateral recess in 8 cases and at right lateral recess in 5 cases. Nine patients had empty sella syndrome, and 11 patients had meningoencephaloceles in addition to SSLR CSF leaks. All patients underwent surgery through the EEMTPA, and a multilayer closure with tissue overlay grafts were used for reconstruction. A pedicled nasoseptal flap and/or pedicled middle turbinate flap were applied to the area of the leak in all cases. One patient had a persistent CSF leak and another had recurrence, both of which required revision surgery. Our overall success rate was 100%.
   CONCLUSIONS: EEMTPA is a safe and effective method that can be used to treat challenging pathologies at the SSLR, including CSF leaks accompanying meningoencephaloceles. Furthermore, the success rate of EEMTPA for SSLR CSF leaks can be increased by applying endoscopic skull base reconstruction techniques such as the pedicled nasoseptal flap and pedicled middle turbinate flap.

LA English
DT Article
DE Champagne bottle neck sign; Hemorrhage; Moyamoya disease
ID ANTERIOR
AB OBJECTIVE: To assess association between champagne bottle neck sign (CBNS) in carotid artery and intracranial hemorrhage in patients with moyamoya disease (MMD).
   METHODS: This retrospective study included 76 consecutive patients with MMD without definite risk factors associated with intracranial hemorrhage who underwent preoperative angiography from January 2016 to December 2017. CBNS was defined as luminal diameter ratio of internal carotid artery/common carotid artery <= 0.5 on angiography. The right and left cerebral hemisphere in each patient was separately identified as hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic. Association between CBNS and intracranial hemorrhage was analyzed.
   RESULTS: Of 76 patients with MMD, intracranial hemorrhage was found in 44 of 152 (28.9%) hemispheres, and 6.8% (3/44) had multiple events. Comparing carotid arteries without intracranial hemorrhage in ipsilateral hemispheres, patients with intracranial hemorrhage in the ipsilateral hemisphere had significantly smaller luminal diameter ratio of internal carotid artery/common carotid artery (0.49 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.55 +/- 0.12, P < 0.01) and higher prevalence of CBNS (63.7% vs. 41.7%, P = 0.01). Comparing hemispheres with intracranial hemorrhage, patients with ipsilateral carotid artery CBNS had significantly higher prevalence of hemorrhage in posterior territories than patients without CBNS (57.1% vs. 23.1%, P = 0.05). Logistic regression revealed that CBNS was significantly associated with ipsilateral intracranial hemorrhage before (odds ratio = 2.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-5.05; P = 0.02) and after (odds ratio = 3.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.50-7.87; P < 0.01) adjusting for female sex, lenticulostriate anastomosis, and choroidal anastomosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: CBNS is significantly associated with intracranial hemorrhage in the ipsilateral hemisphere in patients with MMD, particularly intracranial hemorrhage in posterior territories.

AB OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the reasons and prognosis of unplanned return to the operating room (URTOR) and to help improve neurosurgical service quality.
   METHODS: Medical records of URTOR within 30 days of initial surgery were reviewed at a single neurosurgical center for a period of 3 years. Out of 4516 neurosurgeries, 62 URTOR cases were included to analyze patients' age, sex, initial surgery code, seniority of the performed surgeon, interval between the reopening procedures and initial procedures, reason for reopening, prognosis, and complications.
   RESULTS: The 62 patients underwent 70 URTORs. Out of 1445 primary operations performed by junior surgeons, 40 experienced URTOR, whereas 22 of 3071 craniotomies initially performed by senior surgeons resulted in URTOR. Five patients died in this series. Out of the 54 patients who experienced 1-time URTOR, 3 died, whereas 2 of the 8 patients who experienced 2-time URTOR died. Of 22 URTOR surgeries performed by senior surgeons, 10 took place within 24 hours, compared with 26 out of 48 performed by the junior surgeon.
   CONCLUSIONS: The main reasons for URTOR after neurosurgery were rebleeding and swelling of the brain. The number of URTORs and time from primary craniotomy to URTOR are not associated with morbidity or mortality. However, the seniority of the surgeon affects the rate of URTOR: surgeons with rich experience in surgery may reduce the chance of a second craniotomy and increase the chance of a good prognosis.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether different quantitative measurements of increased signal intensity (ISI) on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging are useful for predicting surgical outcome in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 108 patients with ISI who underwent surgery for CSM. Clinical outcome was evaluated via the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score and the recovery rate. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the JOA recovery rate: good (>= 50%) and fair (<50%). The quantitative measurements of ISI included the maximum vertical length and the signal change ratio (SCR). C2-C7 sagittal alignment, C2-C7 sagittal vertical axis, C2-C7 range of motion, maximum spinal cord compression, and maximum canal compromise also were assessed.
   RESULTS: There were no significant differences in cervical sagittal alignment parameters between the groups. Multivariate analysis showed that a longer duration of symptoms, a lower preoperative JOA score, a longer preoperative ISI length, and a greater preoperative SCR were negatively associated with clinical outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the best cutoff values of ISI length and SCR as negative predictors of surgical outcome were 15.50 mm and 1.56, respectively, and the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of preoperative ISI length, SCR that discriminate recovery rate of JOA score (>= 50%, <50%) were 0.8507, 0.8422, respectively, and was 0.8903 for a combination of the 2.
   CONCLUSIONS: Duration of symptoms, preoperative JOA score, preoperative ISI length, and SCR can reflect surgical outcome in patients with CSM; however, cervical sagittal alignment may not affect surgical outcome. Combining ISI length and SCR to depict ISI on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is optimal and accurate. Patients with ISI length >15.50 mm and SCR >1.56 have fair surgical recovery.

AB BACKGROUND: The tumor microenvironment is partially characterized by a state of chronic inflammation, and radiologic features are related to the tumor's biological behavior. This study was conducted to explore whether peripheral blood inflammatory markers combined with radiologic features could predict proliferation potency. -
   METHODS: This study retrospectively reviewed 183 patients with a primary diagnosis of glioma. Clinical characteristics, preoperative peripheral full blood count data, and brain magnetic resonance imaging findings were reviewed to analyze the expression of inflammatory markers neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte lymphocyte ratio, and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR), as well as radiologic features such as location, peritumor edema, and contrast enhancement. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to determine the proliferation index (i.e., expression of Ki-67). Receiver operating characteristic curves for cutoff value, various bivariate tests, and binary logistic regression analyses were applied.
   RESULTS: Proliferation index was highly associated with tumor grade, showing a gradually increasing tendency. A Ki-67 cutoff value > 9% predicted high-grade glioma (HGG). Mean NLR and PLR were significantly higher in the HGG group compared with the low-grade glioma group (NLR: 3.11 +/- 0.59 vs. 4.27 +/- 1.13; PLR: 133.07 +/- 13.17 vs. 161.51 +/- 38.99; P < 0.01 for both). Contrast enhancement was more likely in the HGG group, but there was no significant between-group difference in peritumor edema. Logistic regression analysis identified the following risk factors for prediction of proliferation potency: age, Karnofsky Performance Score, NLR, PLR, and contrast enhancement. However, age > 43 years, NLR > 3.68, and positive contrast enhancement independently predicted a higher proliferation rate.
   CONCLUSIONS: NLR and contrast enhancement were positively correlated with the proliferation potency of gliomas.

AB BACKGROUND: Foraminal disc herniation is rare. When conservative treatment fails, it is often treated with discectomy via a paraspinal or Wiltse approach. In contained foraminal disc herniation, more symptoms arise from the foraminal compression of the exiting nerve root, including the dorsal root ganglion, than from the herniation itself. We aimed to evaluate the benefits of stand-alone decompression without discectomy for patients with contained foraminal disc herniation.
   METHODS: This study included 17 patients with unilateral single-level foraminal disc herniation (14 women and 3 men; mean age, 62.8 +/- 14.6 years, range, 37-86 years). Disc herniation was confirmed as contained by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and/or computed tomography and by intraoperative exploration. All patients underwent thorough decompression without discectomy, via a paraspinal approach. Pain was evaluated preoperatively and at 3 and 12 months postoperatively using a visual analog scale (VAS). The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Macnab criteria were used to evaluate final outcomes.
   RESULTS: The most commonly affected level was L5-S1. All 17 patients showed significant improvements in VAS and ODI scores at 3 and 12 months postoperatively. According to the Macnab criteria, outcome results were excellent in 13 patients and good in 4. The mean duration of follow-up was 18.4 +/- 2.4 months, with no recurrences or lumbar instability at the final follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Stand-alone decompression without discectomy is an effective method for relieving symptoms and preserving the disc in contained foraminal disc herniation. A minimally invasive approach with thorough decompression techniques yields good results.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical efficacy of navigation-guided minimally invasive surgery in patients with hypertensive basal ganglia hemorrhage.
   METHODS: A total of 64 patients with hypertensive basal ganglia hemorrhage were enrolled in this retrospective study. They were divided into a navigation group and a traditional group based on surgical approaches. The data for the 2 groups of patients were analyzed with regard for the hematoma clearance rate, duration of surgery, duration of hospitalization, Glasgow Outcome Scale score at discharge, Barthel index score at 6 months, and postoperative complication rates for rebleeding and pneumonia.
   RESULTS: There were no significant differences in basic characteristics between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). The hematoma clearance rate was significantly lower in the navigation group (49.18 +/- 16.76%) than in the traditional group (84.29 +/- 6.91%, P < 0.01). The duration of surgery and duration of hospitalization were significantly shorter in the navigation group (55.00 +/- 11.89 minutes and 24.25 +/- 7.1 days, respectively) than in the traditional group (156.38 +/- 47.9 minutes and 32.63 +/- 9.8 days, respectively; both P < 0.01). There were also significant differences between the 2 groups in Glasgow Outcome Scale scores (P=0.006). The Barthel index scores were significantly greater in the navigation group (73.13 +/- 18.76) than in the traditional group (57.63 +/- 26.63, P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the complication rates (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Under certain conditions, compared with standard craniotomy and hematoma evacuation, navigation-guided hematoma puncture aspiration and catheter drainage is simple, effective, and safe as a treatment for hypertensive basal ganglia hemorrhage.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate surgical management of cavernous malformations (CMs) involving the medulla oblongata and to predict risk factors of postoperative respiratory dysfunction (RDF).
   METHODS: Patient data from individuals who underwent surgical treatment for CMs involving the medulla oblongata were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with postoperative RDF and/or deficits of the cough reflex (CR, >= 7 days) were deemed as having bad respiratory statuses. A binary logistic regression analysis tested the association of preoperative predictors with bad postoperative respiratory status.
   RESULTS: The study consisted of 69 patients. Preoperatively, 9 patients (13.0%) had dyspnea, and 4 (5.8%) had hypoxemia. Postoperatively, 11 patients (15.9%) had bad respiratory statuses, including RDF as a respiratory rhythm disorder and/or dyspnea in 6 patients, and >= 7 days of CR deficits in 5 patients. With a mean follow-up duration of 35.3 months, the neurologic status improved in 45 patients (68.2%), remained unchanged in 11 (16.7%), and worsened in 10 (15.1%) relative to the preoperative baseline. A multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that the independent adverse factors of bad postoperative respiratory status were multiple preoperative hemorrhages, large lesion size, and surgical intervention during the chronic period (>8 weeks).
   CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative RDF and CR deficits could commonly occur in patients with CMs involving the medulla oblongata. However, patients with fewer preoperative hemorrhages, small lesion size, and operation within 8 weeks of the last bleeding are prone to be associated with a reduced possibility of bad postoperative respiratory status.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate patient clinical features, surgical complications and outcomes, and the prognostic risk factors of surgical treatment of cavernous malformations (CMs) involving the medulla oblongata.
   METHODS: The charts of 53 patients who underwent surgical treatment for CMs involving the medulla oblongata between 2011 and 2017 were reviewed retrospectively. Patient demographics, lesion characteristics, operative documents, and patient outcomes were examined.
   RESULTS: The study population consisted of 53 patients, with a male/female ratio of 1.4 and a mean age of 32.6 years. Eighteen patients (34.0%) had respiratory dysfunction, and 2 patients (3.8%) had cardiac instabilities, pre-operatively. The mean modified Rankin Scale score was 2.7 on admission. Gross total resection was achieved in 52 patients (98.1%). Postoperatively, 23 patients (43.4%) had respiratory dysfunction, and 16 patients (30.2%) had dysphagia or cough. The mean follow-up duration was 35.7 months. At the last follow-up evaluation, the mean modified Rankin Scale score was 1.7, and 42 patients (84%) had favorable outcomes, with mRS scores <= 2. The conditions of the patients improved in 34 cases (68%), remained unchanged in 10 cases (20%), and worsened in 6 cases (12%) relative to the preoperative baseline. The independent adverse factors for long-term outcome were age >= 50 years and increased time of reservation of tracheal intubation after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of CMs involving the medulla oblongata was challenging, notably, perioperative respiratory dysfunction, with which patients tend to have unfavorable long-term outcomes, especially for elder patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: We established a reliable nomogram model to predict the recurrence of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) after burr hole surgery.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 514 patients who were treated in our hospital between January 2010 and November 2017 and included 231 patients in this study. We used univariate and binary logistic regression analysis to identify the significantly related predictors for recurrence. Subsequently, we established the nomogram model using these predictors and validated it.
   RESULTS: The total rate of recurrence after initial surgery for CSDH was 14.29% (33/231) during the following 3 months. We found that preoperative hematoma volume (greater than 121 mL), postoperative residual cavity volume (greater than 72 mL), computed tomography scan imaging type (hyper- and mixed-density type), and age (older than 65 years of age) were significantly related to recurrence. We used 50% recurrence rate as the classification cutoff, with the corresponding points of 252 to validate the nomogram model. The accuracy of predicting the recurrence of CSDH calculated by the binary logistic regression model was 91.7%. The sensitivity and specificity of the nomogram were 87.88% and 84.85%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: This nomogram model had a high precision to predict the recurrence of CSDH. It needs more external and prospective validation in the future. We expect this model could be used in different neurosurgical problems as well.

AB OBJECTIVE: The optimal surgical procedure for degenerative cervical kyphosis with stenosis (DCKS) remains controversial. The purpose of this study is to describe the preliminary clinical and radiologic results of anterior controllable antedisplacement fusion (ACAF) as a surgical technique for DCKS.
   METHODS: In the period from 2016 through 2017, a consecutive cohort of adults with degenerative cervical kyphosis (30 degrees >= Cobb angles >= 5 degrees) and stenosis (anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal <12 mm) underwent ACAF, a technique making the vertebrae move forward in a hoisting manner. We retrospectively reviewed these patients, and primary outcomes of interest included operation duration, blood loss, hospital stay, kyphosis correction, decompression width, anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal, morphology of the spinal cord, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores, and complications.
   RESULTS: Thirty patients were included in the study. All patients were followed for a mean of 12 months. Mean operation duration and estimated blood loss were 104.8 minutes and 221.6 mL, respectively, and the mean length of hospital stay was 5.6 days. The decompression width reached 17.7 mm. The postoperative anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal was 14.8 mm, with a significant improvement compared with preoperation (P < 0.01). There was also significant kyphosis correction after operation (20.4 degrees vs. 4.8 degrees, P < 0.01). The mean JOA score was significantly better than preoperation (15.0 vs. 9.3 points; P < 0.01). There were no surgery-related complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: ACAF, correcting cervical kyphosis and simultaneously enlarging the volume of the spinal canal, is a good choice for DCKS.

DT Review
DE Intraoperative rupture; Pilot clipping; Pros and cons; Temporary
   clipping; Tentative clipping
AB OBJECTIVE: In direct aneurysm surgery, tentative clipping is frequently applied to facilitate aneurysm dissection. However, no systemic review on the pros and cons of tentative clipping has been conducted. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and concerns of tentative clipping.
   METHODS: A total of 867 direct clippings in 737 patients were performed to treat intracranial aneurysms between 1994 and 2015. We retrospectively investigated the frequency, purpose, location, and adequacy of tentative clipping.
   RESULTS: Tentative clipping was performed in 149 of the 867 aneurysms that were clipped (17.2%). The purpose of tentative clipping was to dissect an aneurysm in 141 (94.6%), separate the vessels from the surface of a sac in 5 (3.4%), and prevent slipping of the final clip in 3 (2.0%) cases. Further dissection revealed that tentative clipping completely excluded the blood flow into the aneurysm in 126 (84.6%) of the 149 cases and incompletely shut it out in 23 (15.4%) cases. Five (21.7%) of the 23 patients with incomplete clipping had intraoperative aneurysm ruptures subsequently.
   CONCLUSIONS: Tentative clipping facilitates dissection of the aneurysm sac from the surrounding structure but can occasionally lead to intraoperative rupture. Before applying tentative clips, surgeons should prepare for temporary clipping or additional tentative clipping in case of a rupture.

AB OBJECTIVE: Neurologic deterioration is the primary distinctive complication after revascularization surgery in patients with moyamoya disease (MMD). The present study investigated the risk factors for neurologic deterioration after combined direct and indirect revascularization in patients with MMD.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of 123 patients with MMD undergoing 138 combined direct and indirect revascularization procedures was performed. Demographics, clinical manifestation, medical history, neurologic deterioration complications, and relevant information of the operation were recorded.
   RESULTS: There were 25 (18.12%) postoperative neurologic deterioration complications (13 reversible neurologic deficits, 9 infarctions with neurologic sequelae, and 3 hemorrhages). Preoperative multiple symptom episodes and one-staged bilateral revascularization were significantly correlated with postoperative neurologic deterioration complications (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). The incidence rate (26.39%) of postoperative neurologic deterioration in ischemic MMDs was significantly greater than hemorrhagic MMDs (7.69%; P < 0.01) In total, 34.78% of patients with transient ischemic attack onset and 22.45% of patients with infarction onset suffered from postoperative neurologic deterioration, and there was no significant difference between them (P > 0.05). Postoperative neurologic deterioration complications had no significant correlation with sex, age at the time of surgery, type of surgical procedure, unilateral MMD or not, interval between the last attack and operation, and history of thyroid disease, hypertension, and autoimmune disease.
   CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative multiple symptom episodes and one-staged bilateral revascularization are risk factors associated with postoperative neurologic deterioration in patients with MMD. Therefore, 2 unilateral revascularization procedures performed successively rather than one-staged bilateral revascularization procedures should be performed in patients with bilateral MMD.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of preoperative simulation based on patient-specific vertebral models, and computer-assisted designed drill navigation templates in expansive open-door laminoplasty (EOLP).
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 18 consecutive patients who underwent EOLP, 11 patients (45 vertebrae) were treated with traditional EOLP (traditional group) and 7 patients (28 vertebrae) were treated with EOLP aided by the drill navigation template and preoperative simulation (template group). We assessed the operation time, intraoperative blood loss, hospitalization expenses, visual analog scale (VAS), Japanese orthopedic association (JOA), neck disability index (NDI), Pavlov's ratio, laminoplasty opening size (LOS), hinge fracture rate and trough positions.
   RESULTS: The operation time of template group (98.6 +/- 13.0 minutes) was significantly shorter (P < 0.05) than that of traditional group (125.4 +/- 13.2 minutes). Both groups achieved similar hospitalization expenses and significant improvement in VAS, JOA score, NDI, and Pavlov ratio. The postoperative hinge fracture rate of template group (0%; 0/28) was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of traditional group (11.1%, 5/45). In template group, all the troughs (56/56 [100%]; 28/28 on the hinge side and 28/28 on the open side), while in traditional group, only 72.2% (65/90; 31/45 on the hinge side and 34/45 on the hinge side) of the troughs were at the proper hinge position.
   CONCLUSIONS: Drill navigation template and preoperative simulations in EOLP are technically feasible. With the help of templates and preoperative simulation, shorten operation time, accurate trough positioning, decrease incidence of hinge fracture and could be acquired. This technique should be further studied and affirmed in clinical applications.

TI Granular Cell Tumor of the Neurohypophysis: 3 Cases and a Systematic
   Literature Review of 98 Cases
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Granular cell tumors; Neurohypophysis; Systematic literature review
ID OF-THE-LITERATURE; PITUITARY-GLAND; SELLAR; CHORISTOMA; PROTEIN
AB BACKGROUND: Granular cell tumors (GCTs) of the neurohypophysis are rare neoplastic diseases of the pituitary. Because of the rare nature of the disease, previous descriptions have been limited to single-case studies, small series, or simple reviews.
   METHODS: We reported 3 cases in our medical center and systematically reviewed 98 cases who met inclusion criteria. Data were gathered on different aspects of GCTs' characteristics, including demographics, clinical features, laboratory features, histological features, immunocytochemical features, radiologic features, and treatment to elucidate any associations useful in determining pathogenesis and appropriate treatment.
   RESULTS: Female sex was significantly associated with GCTs (P < 0.001). The most common presenting symptom and tentative diagnosis were ophthalmologic defects in 61.2% and pituitary adenoma preoperatively in 18.4%, respectively. Most neurohypophysial GCTs possess immunopositivity for S-100 protein (59.1%, 26/44) and negative staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (69.8%, 30/43).
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings lend strong support to the suggestion that tumors probably remain in the transitional cell type. To our knowledge, our systematic review presents the largest number of symptomatic cases ever enumerated, with 98 cases meeting the inclusion criteria.

   GROWTH; ANGIOGRAPHY; MARKER; VOLUME
AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that ionized calcium levels at admission are associated with early hematoma expansion and functional outcome in patients with hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (HICH).
   METHODS: Patients presenting with HICH were enrolled in the observational cohort study that prospectively collected age, sex, blood pressure, history of diabetes and smoking, time from symptom onset to initial computed tomography (CT), admission ionized calcium (iCa) and total calcium (tCa), coagulation function, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and postoperative modified Rankin Scale score. Hematoma reconstruction on CT was performed to measure hematoma volumes. Hematoma expansion (HE) was defined as an increase of more than 30% or 6 mL in HICH volume. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses to assess for association of iCa level with early HE and functional outcome.
   RESULTS: We included 111 patients with HICH for analysis. Admission serum iCa was 1.10 mmol/L in patients with HE and 1.17 in patients without HE. Univariate analysis indicated significant difference of GCS, initial HICH volume, iCa, and tCa between the HE and non-HE groups (P < 0.05). Lower admission iCa (less than 1.12 mmol/L) was associated with HE (odds ratio [OR] 0.300, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.095-0.951, P = 0.041) after adjustment for age, blood pressure, GCS score, time to initial CT scan, baseline HICH volume, prothrombin time, and tCa. Furthermore, predictive factors of poor outcome included iCa (OR 0.192, 95% CI 0.067-0.554, P = 0.002) and GCS score (OR 0.832, 95% CI 0.722-0.959, P = 0.011).
   CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that lower ionized calcium is associated with early hematoma expansion and poor outcome in patients with hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage.

AB BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an important role in the assessment of spinal cord status for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) also is a novel investigation tool with good sensitivity to detect changes in CSM, but it is not routinely used in spinal cord evaluation.
   METHODS: Sixty-six patients with CSM who required surgical decompression were included. All the patients were divided into 4 subgroups according to Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) recovery rate. A 3.0T MR system was applied to obtain DTI of the spinal cord. Clinical assessment was performed with the JOA scores system.
   RESULTS: DTI data of 61 patients were available for further analysis in this study. No significant differences in age, sex, cervical curvature, surgical approach, and preoperative JOA score between the 4 subgroups were found (P > 0.05). Significant differences in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) (P < 0.0001), mean diffusivity (MD), (P < 0.0001), axial diffusivity (AD) (P = 0.0459), and radial diffusivity (RD) (P < 0.0001) values were found between the 4 groups. The ADC (P < 0.0001), MD (P < 0.0001), AD (P = 0.0434), and RD (P < 0.0001) values were significantly correlated with JOA recovery rate. Cutoff values of ADC, MD, AD, and RD in this study were 1.378*10(-3), 1.378*10(-3), 2.386*10(-3), and 0.894*10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: DTI was closely related to the severity of CSM, and cutoff values of DTI enabled the surgeons to predict the surgical outcomes in patients with CSM. These evaluation metrics may reflect the pathologic conditions of the spinal cord quantitatively, and potentially evaluate the functional status of spinal cords.

AB OBJECTIVE: To clarify the safety and efficacy of flow diverter (FD) treatment for blood blisterelike aneurysm (BBA) through a systematic review and literature analyzing perioperative and long-term clinical and angiographic outcomes.
   METHODS: We performed a comprehensive review of the current literature for studies with > 2 patients related to FD treatment of BBAs published. A random-effects metaanalysis was used to pool the following outcomes: complete occlusion, technical success, aneurysm recurrence, rebleeding, perioperative mortality, perioperative stroke, procedure-related morbidity and mortality, long-term neurological morbidity and mortality, and overall good neurologic outcome.
   RESULTS: We included 15 noncomparative studies with a total of 165 target BBAs. Complete occlusion rates were 72% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59e0.85). Recurrence occurred in 13% (95% CI, 0.04-0.29) and rebleeding in 3% (95% CI, -0.02 to 0.07) of patients. Procedure-related morbidity and mortality were 26% (95% CI, 0.19e0.33) and 3% (95% CI, -0.01 to 0.07), respectively. The rate of longterm good outcomes was 83% (95% CI, 0.77-0.89). Subgroup analysis indicated that a single FD strategy for BBA seemed to have a higher rate of good outcomes compared with an overlapped FD strategy (89.9% vs. 61.9%; odds ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.25-14.98, P<0.02). Complete occlusion rate and procedure-related morbidity rate did not see any significant difference between these 2 strategies.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests that in selected cases, FD can be safe and effective. A single FD strategy may result in a higher rate of good outcomes compared with an overlapped FD strategy. Ultimately, treatment of BBA should be considered on a case-by-case basis to maximize patient benefits and limit the risk of perioperative complications.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) grade I on admission are generally considered to have a good clinical outcome.
   OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the actual clinical outcome of WFNS grade I aSAH patients, and to determine which factors are associated with unfavourable outcome.
   METHODS: For this prospective cohort study, 132 consecutive patients (age 18 years or older) with a WFNS grade I aSAH admitted to our hospital between December 2011 and January 2016 were eligible. Clinical outcome was measured using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 6-month follow-up. Unfavorable outcome was defined as an mRS score of 3-6. Univariable analyses were performed using logistic regression models.
   RESULTS: Of 116 patients, only 5 patients (4%) had an mRS score of 0 and most (65%) had an mRS score of 2. Twenty-five patients (22%) had an unfavorable outcome. Nine (8%) patients died, of whom 4 died during admission. Factors associated with unfavorable outcome were age (per increasing decade: odds ratio [OR]. 1.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-2.72), delayed cerebral ischemia (OR, 4.32; 95% CI, 1.63-11.44), pneumonia (OR, 10.75; 95% CI, 1.94-59.46) and meningitis (OR, 28.47; 95% CI, 1.42-571.15).
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite their neurologically optimal clinical condition on admission, 1 in 5 patients with WFNS grade I aSAH has an unfavorable clinical outcome or is dead at 6-month follow-up. Additional multivariable analysis in larger patient cohorts is necessary to identify the extent to which preventable complications contribute to unfavorable outcomes in these patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate prognostic factors of clival chordoma using the largest patient set to date.
   METHODS: Appropriate studies were identified per search criteria, data satisfying criteria were extracted, and survival analysis was performed to investigate prognostic factors of clival chordoma.
   RESULTS: A total of 347 patients from the literature cohort met our inclusion criteria. Of 346 cases in which extent of resection was reported, gross total resection (GTR), subtotal resection, and biopsy were achieved in 118 (34.1%), 205 (59.2%), and 21 (6.1%) cases, respectively. Two (0.6%) subjects did not undergo surgery. Of 185 cases in which surgical approach was reported, 56 (30.3%) underwent an endoscopic transoral approach, 17 (9.2%) microscopic transsphenoidal, 45 (24.3%) endoscopic or microscopic, 45 (24.3%) craniotomy, and 22 (11.9%) other approaches. There was no significant difference in GTR rates of different surgical approaches (P = 0.101). Median follow-up was 46.6 months. The 5- and 10-year rates for progression-free survival (PFS) were 59.2% and 47.9%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year rates for overall survival (OS) were 77.3% and 63.9%, respectively. On multivariate analysis for both PFS and OS, GTR demonstrated significantly improved outcomes when compared with subtotal resection (hazard ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.22-0.90, P = 0.025 for PFS; hazard ratio 0.20, confidence interval 0.06-0.65, P = 0.008 for OS).
   CONCLUSIONS: GTR rates were comparable in different surgical approaches. GTR was a significant predictor of longer PFS and OS in clival chordoma.

AB BACKGROUND: Conventional external beam radiation and stereotactic radiosurgery are common radiation techniques used to treat spinal tumors. Intraoperative brachytherapy (BT) may serve as an alternative when other options have been exhausted or as an adjunct in combination with other therapies. The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature on BT use in spinal tumor surgery.
   METHODS: PubMed and Embase databases were systematically queried for literature reporting the use of BT in the surgical treatment of spinal tumors. PRISMA guidelines were followed. A meta-analysis was performed.
   RESULTS: Of the 203 initial articles queried, 15 studies were included. Of the 370 total patients described, 78% were treated for spine metastases. Indications for BT included tumors refractory to previous treatments and inability to tolerate chemotherapy, radiation, and/or open surgery. Seed placement was the most common method of delivery (58%) compared with plaques (42%). BT was placed during an open procedure in 52%, and of the remaining percutaneous procedures, 47% were combined with cement augmentation. Tumor recurrence rates varied from 13% to 49%. Seven studies reporting visual analog scale scores reported significant improvement in pain control.
   CONCLUSIONS: BT was used to treat metastatic disease in patients who failed previous therapies and could not tolerate open surgery or further therapy. This review summarizes the major findings in the available literature pertaining to patient background, indications, and outcomes. Spinal BT seems to be a viable option for spine tumor treatment and should be made available at treating centers.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify the top 50 most-cited articles in the literature focusing on thoracolumbar spine fractures.
   METHODS: Using the ISI Web of Science version 5.11 database and the search phrase "thoracolumbar fracture," we queried for the 50 most-cited articles on thoracolurnhar fractures. The study was performed in September 2017. We searched for articles published between 1900 and 2017. Articles were sorted and ranked based on the total number of citations. We evaluated the following information pertaining to each article: first author, year of publication, j auirnal, and title.
   RESULTS: A total of 271 studies matched our search criteria, of which the top 50 most-cited ranged between 267 and 81 citations. Twelve articles were cited more than 200 times. The article by McLain et al. was the most-cited article, with 267 citations, followed by Vaccaro et al. with 237 and Mumford et al. with 236. The majority of the studies originated from the United States (n = 26) and were published in the 1990s. Spine was the most frequent destination journal (n = 26), followed by the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (n = 7). Most of the articles focused on the clinical management of thoracolumbar fracture (82%). Vaccaro and McAfee were the most cited first authors, with 3 articles each.
   CONCLUSIONS: Thoracolumbar fractures are the most common injuries of the spine, and the incidence is increasing globally. To understand current treatment guidelines and how treatment of these fractures has evolved, it is important to know the most-cited articles pertaining to these fractures.

DE Cervical expansive laminoplasty; Surgical technique; Ultrasonic bone
   curette
ID MYELOPATHY
AB BACKGROUND: hi cervical expansive laminoplasty, precise placement of lateral glitters is important. Placing them too medially results in suboptimal canal expansion, and placing them too laterally results in facet joint violation. However, precise placement is often difficult.
   METHODS: We have included a simple procedure called probe laminotomy in cervical expansive laminoplasty since 2013, This technique consisted of identifying the location of the pedicles through a small laminotomy with medial facetectomy before making lateral gutters. A case -control study was performed to compare the achieved postoperative canal area and duration of surgery between the original technique and the added probe laminotomy.
   RESULTS: The postoperative canal area was 21% larger in the probe laminotomy group compared with the standard technique group (P = 0.0003) There was no significant difference in duration of surgery between the groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: This technique facilitated more precise placement of the lateral gutter in cervical expansive laminoplasty, which resulted in a larger postoperative canal. This technique should be considered as an option in cervical expansive laininoplasty.

In addition, the associations between discharge location and outcomes and complication rates have not been elucidated in these patients. In this study, we aimed to define factors predicting disposition to an SNF/IR and to elucidate the rates of complications occurring in patients sent to home versus to a facility.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of a multicenter ASO database, which included patients who underwent surgery betvveen 2009 and 2014. Inclusion criteria were age >18 years, MIS as part of index surgery, location of discharge, and at least 1 of the following: pelvic tilt >20, sagittal vertical axis >5 cm, pelvic incidence lumbar lordosis mismatch >10, or lumbar scoliosis >20. Patients with a 2 year follow-up were included. Preoperative demographic and radiographic data, postoperative N30 day) complications, and health -related quality of life were analyzed.
   RESULTS: A total of 182 patients met our inclusion criteria, including 113 who were discharged to home and 59 who were discharged to an SNF/IR. Older patients (>50 years) were mare likely to be discharged to an SNF/IR (P = 0.043). Those aged >70 years were G -fold more likely to go to an SNF/IR. No association was identified between discharge to an SNF/IR and any radiographic. parameters except preoperative pelvic tilt;odds ratio I.OR.I, 1.11; P = 0.009). Staged cases were more likely to be discharged to an SNI/IR (OR, 3.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-9,46, P = 0.032); otherwise, there was no difference in levels treated, iveratimi time, estimated blood loss, osteatomy, or length of hospital stay. Patients requiring discharge to an SNF/IR had a higher rate of complications {58% vs. 39.8%; P 0.017), including major complications {19.5% vs. 41%; P = 01101), perioperative complications 14.2% vs. 31.9%; P = 0.004) and infections {3.5% vs. 13,10; P = 0.015). Patients discharged to an SNF/IR had a higher rate of revision (19.5% vs. 33%; P = 0.035). Health -related quality of life measures were similar regardless of disposition.
   CONCLUSIONS: Older patients and those undergoing staged MIS deformity correction have a higher likelihood of postoperative disposition t n SNF/IR. Complications occurred more commonly in those patients requiring transter to an SNF/IR alter hospitalization.

AB OBJECTIVE: To trace anatomic variations of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) in its intrapelvic course.
   METHODS: Ferry cadavers (80 sides) fixed in 10% formalin solution were dissected. The following parameters were recorded: LFCN diameter and variations in its origin and number. The dissection comprised exposure and excision of the lumbar plexus, together with the roots of LFCN, followed by retrograde intraneural fascicular dissection using microsurgical instruments.
   RESULTS: Several types of LFCN origin from the lumbar plexus were observed. Typically, the LFCN appears as a single trunk arising from dorsal divisions of the ventral ram of the lumbar plexus. The most prevalent origin of the nerve was from the 12 and 13 roots (47 cases; 58.75%). The LFCN took an origin from the 11-1.2 level in 12 cases (15%) and from the L2 nerve in 9 cases (11,25%), The main observed variations were the presence of the accessory LFCN (2 cases; 2.5%) and branching of the LFCN from the femoral nerve (6 cases; 7.5%). Communications between the LFCN and the femoral or genitofemoral nerves also were observed occasionally. An atypical course of the LFCN with respect to the anterior psoas was observed in our material in 3 of the 80 sides (3.75% of the examined LFCN specimens).
   CONCLUSIONS: Considerable variability in the origin and the course of the LFCN was observed, which should be taken into account during clinical assessment of nerve lesions and during surgery via transpsoas approaches to the lumbar spine.

AB BACKGROUND: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a devastating disease. Emerging evidence has indicated that the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype might be associated with the risk of aSAH as well as complications and outcomes after aSAH, although the results remain controversial.
   METHODS: We searched published literature on PuhMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and VVanfang database to identify studies involving the ApoE genotype and aSAH. A meta -analysis wag performed to summarize the relationship between ApoE genotype and aSAH, including susceptibility, complications, and prognosis.
   RESULTS: Eighteen studies were considered eligible for inclusion. Generally,.4 carriers had increased risk of aSAH (odds ratio [OR] 1,23, 95% confidence interval [CO 1.01-1,49). White patients with the c2.42 genotype had a greater risk of aSAH (OR 3.38, 95% CI 1.13 10.11). The patients with aSAH carrying the e 4 allele had an increased risk of poor outcome (OR 2,21, 95% CI 1.21-4.05) compared with non -r4 carriers, especially in Asian patients (OR 4.99, 95% CI 1.73-14.40). ApoE e 4 carriers have increased risk of delayed ischemic neurologic deficit compared with non -r'4 carriers in the overall population. No significant difference vvas detected regarding the effect of certain ApoE genotypes aan aSAH admission severity, rebleeding, or cerebral vasospasm after aSAH.
   CONCLUSIONS: We found that the ApoE genotype was significantly associated with aSAH risk, whereas its effect on certain ethnic populations differs. Patient carrying the r4 allele might have a worse outcome, whereas current evidence was insufficient to prove the association between ApoE genotypes and post-SAH complications.

AB OBJECTIVE: Meralgia paresthetica is a mononeuropathy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) caused by compression around the inguinal ligament. We report a surgical alternative for the treatment of meralgia paresthetica under local anesthesia and its outcomes.
   METHODS: We operated on 12 patients with unilateral meralgia paresthetica whose age at surgery ranged from 62 to 75 years. The mean postoperative follow -rap period was 19 months. Microsurgical deep decompression of LFCN was performed with the patient under local anesthesia. Clinical outcomes of Surgical treatment were assessed based an the patient's mast recent follow-up visit and were classified into 3 categories: complete, partial, or no relief of symptoms. Symptoms of pain or numbness in the anterolateral part of the thigh were evaluated, using a visual analog scale, before surgery and after surgery, i.e., at the most recent follovvup visit.
   RESULTS: All patients reported symptom improvement: complete relief in 9 patients (75%) and partial relief in 3 patients (25%). In the 3 patients with partial relief, the remaining symptoms did not affect their daily living. Overall, the visual analog scale scores were significantly improved in all patients 1P < 0.05), and no patient experienced postoperative recurrence of their symptoms at the time of the last follow-up visit.
   CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of meralgia paresthetica can resemble those of a lumbosacral disorder. Microsurgical deep decompression under local anesthesia produces good surgical outcomes. The use of local anesthesia contributes not only to reduction of pain during surgery but also eliminates excessive surgical procedures and reduces the duration of hospital stay.

AB BACKGROUND: Disc herniations M the cervicothoracic junction (C7-T1 level) are unusual, and there have only been a few studies of patients with herniated C7-T1 discs. In addition, previous studies did not focus on the mechanism and causes of solitary cervicothoracic junction disc herniation. The authors investigated the characteristics, symptom duration, clinical course, and biornechanics of cervicothoracic junction disc herniation by comparing patients with C7-T1 disc herniation (C7-11 group) with control groups.
   METHODS: Thirty-six patients who underwent solitary C7-T1 single-level disc surgery between 2006 and 2015 were included. For radiographic comparison, patients in a herniated C5-C6 disc group and the healthy control group were cohort matched.
   RESULTS: In the C7-T1 group, the disc herniation mainly occurred in the foramina! space (P < 0.0001). The C7-T1 group was significantly associated with a history of trauma (P < 0.0001). In addition, the cervical vertebral body was more readily observed on plain lateral radiographs in the C7-T1 group (7.36 I 0.068). Patients in the C5-C6 group tended to have the sternal notch more frequently located above the T2-13 disc space than other groups (P = 0.014).
   CONCLUSIONS: C7-T1 disc herniation demonstrates unique characteristics. Understanding the features of disc herniation at the cervicothoracic junction would be helpful for optimal care.

TI Subdural Hygroma Following Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy:
   Understanding the Pathophysiology
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Endoscopic third ventriculostomy; Hydrocephalus; Subdural hygroma;
   Ventriculoperitoneal shunt
ID FAILURE; AGE
AB BACKGROUND: Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) has overtaken the use of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for the treatment of congenital hydrocephalus. Although ETV is relatively safe, several postoperative complications have been reported. One of the least described and understood complications is subdural hygroma following third ventriculostomy.
   METHODS: In this series, we retrospectively analyzed patients who were managed for postventriculostomy subdural hygroma and analyzed the possible factors responsible for this condition.
   RESULTS: A total of 248 patients who underwent ETV between 2014 and 2016 were included in this study. Twelve patients (4.8 /e) had developed subdural hygroma, including 6 patients with bilateral hygroma, 2 with contralateral hygroiria, and 4 with ipsilateral subdural hygroma. Only 4 patients (1.6%) were symptomatic, with complains of pseudomeningocele, persistent vomiting, or headache. Significant mass effect was present in 2 patients with unilateral subdural hygrorna, which improved after placernent of a subduroperitoneal shunt. In 1 patient, the subdural hygroma decreased with persistent ventriculomegaly and improved after ventriculoperitoneal shunt implantation. One patient with posttraumatic hydrocephalus who had a bilateral subdural hygroma following ETV improved with conservative management. At a 12 -month follow-up, all patients remained asymptomatic.
   CONCLUSIONS: Post-ETV subdural hygrorna may result from poor absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the subarachnoid space, dysfunction of the stoma with persistence of the ventriculosubdural fistula, or altered CSF cytology, such as hemorrhage. Most of these patients remain asymptomatic and improve with time. Symptomatic patients should be properly evaluated for the cause of the formation of subdural hygroma, which will guide the appropriate interventions.

ID ABNORMAL MUSCLE RESPONSE; NEUROVASCULAR COMPRESSION; VERTEBRAL ARTERY;
   SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Micravascular decompression (MVO) has become widely accepted as first -line therapy for hemifacial spasm. However, not all patients are candidates for the procedure, and some surgeons ignore arterioles that represent the actual underlying cause of the condition. The aim of this study was to address the role of involved arterioles in management of MVD in patients with hetrafacial spasm.
   METHODS: Data were collected from 765 consecutive patients who underwent MVD from January 2009 to August 2010 in our hospital. Electromyographic abnormal muscle response and Z -L response were used to identify the involved arterioles. AO patients were followed for 25-35 months.
   RESULTS: Compression by the involved arterioles was identified in 20 patients. The most commonly involved arteriole was a branch of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery, followed by the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. During follow-up, effective outcomes were achieved in 93.6% of patients with involved arterioles. There was no MVD-related mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS: The main reason for failed MVD is that the involved offending vessel is not correctly identified. Intraoperative abnormal muscle response and Z -L response are good supplementary measures to identify involved arterioles. In addition, not isolating or coagulating the involved arterioles increases the risk associated with the operation.

AB The Dongbulage porphyry Mo-dominant and Taibudai Cu-(Mo) deposits are located in the central-southern Great Xing'an Range, Inner Mongolia, northeastern China, and are associated with granite porphyry and monzogranite intrusions, respectively. Re-Os isotope data for five molybdenite samples from the Dongbulage Mo deposit give a weighted mean model age of 164.3 +/- 1.2 Ma, which is in accordance with a zircon U-Pb age of 164.5 +/- 1.7 Ma for the host granite porphyry, indicating that the deposit formed at the end of the Middle Jurassic. The zircon U-Pb age of the Taibudai ore-bearing monzogranite is 137.9 +/- 1.7 Ma, indicating that the deposit formed in the Early Cretaceous.
   Whole-rock geochemical data indicate that the Dongbulage granite porphyry and the Taibudai monzogranite are high-K calc-alkaline, and have REE patterned light rare earth elements (LREEs) enriched and heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) depleted. Both plutons show Ba, Nb, and Ti depletions on normalized trace element diagrams, and the Dongbulage granite porphyry shows strongly negative Eu anomalies which are absent in the Taibudai intrusion. The geochemical differences between the two intrusions suggest that the Dongbulage granite porphyry is the result of more advanced fractional crystallization, which led to the formation of a Mo-dominant deposit, whereas the lesser degree of crystal fractionation in the Taibudai monzogranitic magma resulted in the formation of a Cu deposit. The relatively listric-shaped REE patterns of Taibudai rocks suggest more hydrous parental magmas than that of Dongbulage rocks. Therefore, fractional crystallization and magma water content exert a significant control on the styles of mineralization (Mo-versus Cu-dominant) in the central-southern Great Xing'an Range.

AB Environmental stress factors initiate the developmental process of sporulation in some Gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus subtilis. Upon sporulation initiation the bacterial cell undergoes a series of morphological transformations that result in the creation of a single dormant spore. Early in sporulation, an asymmetric cell division produces a larger mother cell and smaller forespore. Next, the mother cell septal membrane engulfs the forespore, and an essential channel, the so-called feeding-tube apparatus, is formed. This assembled channel is thought to form a transenvelope secretion complex that crosses both mother cell and forespore membranes. At least nine proteins are essential for channel formation including SpoIIQ under forespore control and the eight SpoIIIA proteins (SpoIIIAA-AH) under mother cell control. Several of these proteins share similarity with components of Gram-negative bacterial secretion systems and the flagellum. Here we report the X-ray crystallographic structure of the soluble domain of SpoIIIAF to 2.7 angstrom resolution. Like the channel components SpoIIIAG and SpoIIIAH, SpoIIIAF adopts a conserved ring-building motif (RBM) fold found in proteins from numerous dual membrane secretion systems of distinct function. The SpoIIIAF RBM fold contains two unique features: an extended N-terminal helix, associated with multimerization, and an insertion at a loop region that can adopt two distinct conformations. The ability of the same primary sequence to adopt different secondary structure conformations is associated with protein regulation, suggesting a dual structural and regulatory role for the SpoIIIAF RBM. We further analyzed potential interaction interfaces by structure-guided mutagenesis in vivo. Collectively, our data provide new insight into the possible roles of SpoIIIAF within the secretion-like apparatus during sporulation.

This linear model takes into account the three-dimensional point spread function (PSF) of the optical system, which consequently enhances the reconstruction of data. The feasibility of the model is demonstrated on both simulated and experimental data, based on theoretically estimated and experimentally measured PSFs.

AB Neprilysin is a transmembrane M13 zinc metalloprotease responsible for the degradation of several biologically active peptides including insulin, enkephalin, substance P, bradykinin, endothelin-1, neurotensin and amyloid-beta. The protein has received attention for its role in modulating blood pressure responses with its inhibition producing an antihypertensive response. To date, several inhibitor bound crystal structures of the human neprilysin extracellular domain have been determined, but, a structure free of bound inhibitor or substrate has yet to be reported. Here, we report the first crystal structure free of substrate or inhibitor for the extracellular catalytic domain of human neprilysin at 1.9 angstrom resolution. This structure will provide a reference point for comparisons to future inhibitor or substrate bound structures. The neprilysin structure also reveals that a closed protein conformation can be adopted in protein crystals absent of bound substrate or inhibitor.

TI Characterization of inter-crystallite peptides in human enamel rods

AB Proteins of the inter-rod sheath and peptides within the narrow inter-crystallite space of the rod structure are considered largely responsible for visco-elastic and visco-plastic properties of enamel. The present study was designed to investigate putative peptides of the inter-crystallite space. Entities of 1-6 kDa extracted from enamel rods of erupted permanent teeth were analysed by mass spectrometry (MS) and shown to comprise N-terminal amelogenin (AMEL) peptides either containing or not containing exon 4 product. Other dominant entities consisted of an N-terminal peptide from ameloblastin (AMBN) and a series of the most hydrophobic peptides from serum albumin (ALBN). Amelogenin peptides encoded by the Y-chromosome allele were strongly detected in Enamel from male teeth. Location of N-terminal AMEL peptides as well as AMBN and ALBN, between apatite crystallites, was disclosed by immunogold scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Density plots confirmed the relative abundance of these products including exon 4 + AMEL peptides that have greater capacity for binding to hydroxyapatite. Hydrophilic X and Y peptides encoded in exon 4 differ only in substitution of non-polar isoleucine in Y for polar threonine in X with reduced disruption of the hydrophobic N-terminal structure in the Y form. Despite similarity of X and Y alleles of AMEL the non-coding region upstream from exon 4 shows significant variation with implications for segregation of processing of transcripts from exon 4. Detection of fragments from multiple additional proteins including keratins (KER), fetuin A (FETUA), proteinases and proteinase inhibitors, likely reflect biochemical events during enamel formation.

AB Recent advances in instrumentation and automation have made cryo-EM a popular method for producing near-atomic resolution structures of a variety of proteins and complexes. Sample preparation is still a limiting factor in collecting high quality data. Thickness of the vitreous ice in which the particles are embedded is one of the many variables that need to be optimized for collection of the highest quality data. Here we present two methods, using either an energy filter or scattering outside the objective aperture, to measure ice thickness for potentially every image collected. Unlike geometrical or tomographic methods, these can be implemented directly in the single particle collection workflow without interrupting or significantly slowing down data collection. We describe the methods as implemented into the Leginon/Appion data collection workflow, along with some examples from test cases. Routine monitoring of ice thickness should prove helpful for optimizing sample preparation, data collection, and data processing.

AB Cross-sections were prepared by ultramicrotome (UM) and focused ion beam (FIB) system in order to examine the skeletal structure of ecologically and geologically important shell-bearing protists: phaeodarians and radiolarians. The elemental composition of the skeleton was clarified by the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, suggesting that the skeletons of both groups are mainly made of amorphous silica (SiO2 center dot nH(2)O) with other minor elements (Na, Mg, Al, Cl, K, Ca and Fe) and that these two groups have similar elemental composition, compared with other siliceous organisms (diatoms and sponges). However, the structural difference among the two groups was confirmed: phaeodarian skeletons are porous, unlike radiolarians with solid skeletons. It was also revealed that the phaeodarian skeleton contains concentric layered structure with spaces, presumably related to the ontogenetic skeleton formation. The distinction in the skeletal ultrafine structure (porous/solid and non-dense/dense) would reflect the ecological difference among the two groups and could be an effective criterion to determine whether microfossils belong to Radiolaria or Phaeodaria. The UM and FIB combined method presented in this study could be a useful approach to examine the chemical and structural characteristics of unculturable and/or rare microorganisms.

AB For many macromolecular complexes, the inability to uniformly disperse solubilized specimen particles within vitreous ice films precludes their analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Here, we introduce a sample preparation process using "perpetually-hydrated" graphene oxide flakes as particle support films, and report vastly improved specimen dispersion. The new method introduced in this study incorporates hydrated graphene oxide flakes into a standard sample preparation regime, without the need for additional tools or devices, making it a cost-effective and easily adoptable alternative to currently available sample preparation approaches.

AB Graphene oxide (GO) sheets have been used successfully as a supporting substrate film in several recent cryogenic electron-microscopy (cryo-EM) studies of challenging biological macromolecules. However, difficulties in preparing GO-covered holey carbon EM grids have limited their widespread use. Here, we report a simple and robust method for covering holey carbon EM grids with GO sheets and demonstrate that these grids can be used for high-resolution single particle cryo-EM. GO substrates adhere macromolecules, allowing cryo-EM grid preparation with lower specimen concentrations arid provide partial protection from the air-water interface. Additionally, the signal of the GO lattice beneath the frozen-hydrated specimen can be discerned in many motion-corrected micrographs, providing a high-resolution fiducial for evaluating beam-induced motion correction.

AB The 3DEM map challenge provided an opportunity to test different algorithms and workflows for processing single particle cryo-EM data. We were interested in testing whether we could use the standard Appion workflow with minimal manual intervention to achieve similar or better resolution than other challengers. Another question we were interested in testing was what the influence of particle sorting and elimination would be on the resolution and quality of 3D reconstructions. Since apoferritin is historically a challenging particle for single particle reconstruction and the authors of the original map challenge data used only a fraction of the particles present in the dataset, we focused on the apoferritin dataset for our entry. We submitted a 3.7 angstrom map from 25,844 particles and a 3.6 angstrom map from 53,334 particles and after assessment were among the best of the apoferritin maps that were submitted. Here we present the details of our reconstruction strategy and compare our strategy to that of another high-scoring apoferritin map. Altogether, our results suggest that for a relatively conformationally homogeneous particle like apoferritin, including as many particles as possible after elimination of junk leads to the highest resolution, and the choice of parameters for custom mask creation can lead to subtle but significant changes in the resolution of 3D reconstructions.

AB The Bsoft package is aimed at processing electron micrographs for the determination of the three-dimensional structures of biological specimens. Recent advances in hardware allow us to solve structures to near atomic resolution using single particle analysis (SPA). The Map Challenge offered me an opportunity to test the ability of Bsoft to produce reconstructions from cryo-electron micrographs at the best resolution. I also wanted to understand what needed to be done to work towards full automation with validation. Here, I present two cases for the Map Challenge using Bsoft: beta-galactosidase and GroEL. I processed two independent subsets in each case with resolution-limited alignment. In both cases the reconstructions approached the expected resolution within a few iterations of alignment. I further validated the results by coherency-testing: i.e., that the reconstructions from real particles give better resolutions than reconstructions from the same number of aligned noise images. The key operations requiring attention for full automation are: particle picking, faster accurate alignment, proper mask generation, appropriate map sharpening, and understanding the amount of data needed to reach a desired resolution.

AB Single alpha-helices (SAHs) are increasingly recognized as important structural and functional elements of proteins. Comprehensive identification of SAH segments in large protein datasets was largely hindered by the slow speed of the most restrictive prediction tool for their identification, FT_CHARGE on common hardware. We have previously implemented an FPGA-based version of this tool allowing fast analysis of a large number of sequences. Using this implementation, we have set up of a semi-automated pipeline capable of analyzing full UniProt releases in reasonable time and compiling monthly updates of a comprehensive database of SAH segments. Releases of this database, denoted CSAHDB, is available on the CSAHserver 2 website at csahserver.itk.ppke.hu. An overview of human SAH-containing sequences combined with a literature survey suggests specific roles of SAH segments in proteins involved in RNA-based regulation processes as well as cytoskeletal proteins, a number of which is also linked to the development and function of synapses.

AB In protein modelling and design, an understanding of the relationship between sequence and structure is essential. Using parallel, homotetrameric coiled-coil structures as a model system, we demonstrated that machine learning techniques can be used to predict structural parameters directly from the sequence. Coiled coils are regular protein structures, which are of great interest as building blocks for assembling larger nanostructures. They are composed of two or more alpha-helices wrapped around each other to form a supercoiled bundle. The coiled-coil bundles are defined by four basic structural parameters: topology (parallel or antiparallel), radius, degree of supercoiling, and the rotation of helices around their axes. In parallel coiled coils the latter parameter, describing the hydrophobic core packing geometry, was assumed to show little variation. However, we found that subtle differences between structures of this type were not artifacts of structure determination and could be predicted directly from the sequence. Using this information in modelling narrows the structural parameter space that must be searched and thus significantly reduces the required computational time. Moreover, the sequence-structure rules can be used to explain the effects of point mutations and to shed light on the relationship between hydrophobic core architecture and coiled-coil topology.

ID MOLECULAR REPLACEMENT
AB alpha-Helical coiled coils (CCs) represent an important, highly regular protein folding motif. To date, many thousands of CC structures have been determined experimentally. Their geometry is usually modelled by theoretical equations introduced by F. Crick that involve a predefined set of parameters. Here we have addressed the problem of efficient CC parameterization from scratch by performing a statistical evaluation of all available CC structures. The procedure is based on the principal component analysis and yields a minimal set of independent parameters that provide for the reconstruction of the complete CC structure at a required precision. The approach is successfully validated on a set of canonical parallel CC dimers. Its applications include all cases where an efficient sampling of the CC geometry is important, such as for solving the phase problem in crystallography.

AB Decentralized drinking water treatment is limited by supply of service, consumables, spare parts and in particular, power. Therefore, gravity-driven dead-end ultrafiltration is applied to purify surface water with high suspended solid loading. To obtain high flux in the long term, an effective membrane backwash is mandatory. Also, disinfection and cleaning is required regularly. Here we propose a new process coping with these particular challenges in decentralized water production: Temperature Enhanced Backwash. Herein, the membrane is backwashed at elevated temperature and corresponding steam pressure. A mathematical description of the Temperature Enhanced Backwash reveals that membrane pores are filled predominantly with liquid phase, irrespectively of whether membranes are charged with saturated steam or boiling liquid. A steam - water mixture is discharged at the module outlet suggesting evaporation at the end of the pores. This evaporation at membrane - fluid interface supposedly creates high volume fluxes shearing off potential fouling layers. Combined with gravity-driven filtration, the overall process potentially can cope with highly intermittent electrical power supply or even its absence. The methodology shows competitive cleaning efficacy compared to mechanical backwashing as demonstrated experimentally using silica nanoparticles, humic acid and river water. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB As disinfection by-products of parabens, halogenated parabens are frequently detected in aquatic environments and exhibit higher persistence and toxicity than parabens themselves. An interesting phenomenon was found that UV absorption redshift (similar to 45 nm) occurs after halogenation of parabens at circumneutral pH, leading to overlap with the spectrum of terrestrial sunlight. This work presents the first evidence on the direct photodegradation of seven chlorinated and brominated parabens under simulated sunlight. These halogenated parabens underwent rapid direct photodegradation, distinguished from the negligible degradation of the parent compounds. The photodegradation rate depended on their forms and substituents. The deprotonation of halogenated parabens facilitated the direct photodegradation. Brominated parabens exhibited higher degradation efficiency than chlorinated parabens, and mono-halogenated parabens had higher degradation than di-halogenated parabens. The pseudo first-order rate constants (k(obs)) for brominated parabens (0.075-0.120 min(-1)) were approximately 7-fold higher than those of chlorinated parabens (0.011-0.017 min(-1)). A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model suggested that the photodegradation was linearly correlated with the C-X bond energies, electronic and steric effects of halogen substituents. The photodegradation products were identified using QTOF-MS analyses and a degradation pathway was proposed. The yeast two-hybrid estrogenicity assay revealed that the estrogenic activities of the photoproducts were negligible. These findings are important for the removal of halogenated parabens and predictions of their fate and potential impacts in surface waters. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A hybrid algal photosynthesis and ion exchange (HAPIX) process was developed that uses natural zeolite (chabazite) and wild type algae to treat high ammonium (NH4+) strength wastewater. In the HAPIX process, NH4+ is temporarily adsorbed from the liquid, which reduces the free ammonia (FA) concentration below the inhibitory level for algal growth. The slow release of adsorbed NH4+-N subsequently supports the continuous growth of algae. In this study, a HAPIX reactor reduced NH4+-N concentrations in centrate from an anaerobic digester from 1180 mg L-1 to below 10 mg L-1 without dilution. Chabazite doses of 60 g L-1 produced more algal biomass, with higher protein and starch contents, than doses of 150 g L-1 and 250 g L-1. Approximately 67-70% of fatty acids in the algal biomass harvested from HAPIX reactors were unsaturated. A mathematical framework that couples a homogeneous surface diffusion model with a co-limitation algal kinetic growth model reasonably predicted the algal biomass production and NH4+-N concentrations in the HAPIX reactors. The HAPIX process has the potential to serve a two-fold purpose of high NH4+-N strength wastewater treatment and agricultural or commercial biopolymer production. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Porous pavements are commonly used stormwater management systems. However, the understanding of their long-term capacity to retain heavy metals is limited. This study aims to investigate the long-term removal of heavy metals in three different porous pavements Porous Asphalt (PA), Hydrapave (HP) and Permapave (PP) over accelerated laboratory experiments representing 26 years with varying hydrological conditions (drying/wetting periods and flow rates). A treatment model that simulates adsorption and desorption processes was developed for the first time to predict the long-term heavy metal removal by porous pavements. Unsurprisingly, all tested porous pavements performed better in removing metals that tend to attach to solid particles (e.g. Pb, Al, Fe) than more soluble ones (e.g. Cu, Zn, and Mn). There was a general increase of heavy metal concentrations at the outlet of the pavements over time as a result of a decrease in adsorption capacity of the systems, especially after the occurrence of clogging; the soluble heavy metals removal decreased with a reduction in flow rates which was speculated to be due to more time being available for desorption of metals and breakdown of accumulated sediments. The proposed model simulated the trend, fluctuations and peaks of heavy metal concentrations reasonably well, achieving the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE) values of 0.53-0.68 during model calibration. The model was most promising in predicting Al and Cu release from porous pavements (50%-91% of the observed data within the 90% uncertainty bands, NSE = 0.44-0.74), followed by Fe and Pb (27-77% observations within the bands, NSE = 0.20-0.69). Further improvements of the model are needed for it to be applicable for Zn and Mn. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Quantifying sporadic waterborne infections in community settings can be challenging. Salivary antibody immunoassays are a promising non-invasive tool that can be used in prospective studies of common infections, especially those involving children.
   This study was conducted in a Massachusetts city, which uses a microbiologically contaminated river as its water source, during summer-early winter periods before and after construction of a new drinking water treatment plant. Monthly saliva samples (7480 samples from 1170 children and 816 adults) were analyzed for immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to recombinant proteins of Cryptosporidium, one genogroup I (GI) and two GII noroviruses. Immunoconversion was defined as at least four-fold increase in specific antibody responses between two monthly samples with a post-conversion response above a flexible age-dependent cut-off.
   Episodes of gastroenteritis (diarrhea or vomiting or cramps) were associated with 3.2 (95% confidence limits 1.1; 9.5) adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of immunoconversion to Cryptosporidium; episodes of combined diarrhea and vomiting symptoms were associated with 3.5 (0.8; 15.0) and 4.6 (1.7; 12.6) aORs of an immunoconversion to GI and GII noroviruses, respectively. Swimming in natural water bodies or chlorinated pools was associated with 2.3 (0.4; 15.4) and 4.9 (1.6; 15.5) aORs of immunoconversion to Cryptosporidium, respectively. in a subset of study participants who did not use home water filters, consumption of at least some amount of non-boiled tap water reported in a monthly recall survey was associated with 11.1 (1.2; 100.0) and 0.6 (0.1; 2.5) aORs of immunoconversion to Cryptosporidium before and after the new water treatment plant construction, respectively. Among individuals who used home water filters, associations between non-boiled tap water consumption and Cryptosporidium immunoconversion were not significant before and after new plant construction with aORs of 0.8 (0.2; 3.3) and 0.3 (0.1; 1.6), respectively. The interaction effect of study phase and non-boiled tap water consumption on Cryptosporidium immunoconversions was statistically significant in the entire study population with aOR of 5.4 (1.1; 25.6).

AB Nature-based solutions provide a variety of benefits in growing cities, ranging from stormwater treatment to amenity provision such as aesthetics. However, the decision-making process involved in the installation of such green infrastructure is not straightforward, as much uncertainty around the location, size, costs and benefits impedes systematic decision-making. We developed a model to simulate decision rules used by local municipalities to install nature-based stormwater treatment systems, namely constructed wetlands, ponds/basins and raingardens. The model was used to test twenty-four scenarios of policy-making, by combining four asset selection, two location selection and three budget constraint decision rules. Based on the case study of a local municipality in Metropolitan Melbourne, Australia, the modelled uptake of stormwater treatment systems was compared with attributes of real-world systems for the simulation period. Results show that the actual budgeted funding is not reliable to predict systems' uptake and that policy-makers are more likely to plan expenditures based on installation costs. The model was able to replicate the cumulative treatment capacity and the location of systems. As such, it offers a novel approach to investigate the impact of using different decision rules to provide environmental services considering biophysical and economic factors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Modified phosphogypsum (MPG) was developed to improve dewaterability of sewage sludge, and dewatering performance, properties of treated sludge, composition and morphology distribution of EPS, dynamic analysis and multiple regression model on bound water release were investigated. The results showed that addition of MPG caused extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) disintegration through charge neutralization. Destruction of EPS promoted the formation of larger sludge flocs and the release of bound water into supernatant. Simultaneously, content of organics with molecular weight between 1000 and 7000 Da in soluble EPS (SB-EPS) increased with increasing of EPS dissolved into the liquid phase. Besides, about 8.8 kg.kg(-1)DS of bound water was released after pretreatment with 40%DS MPG dosage. Additionally, a multiple linear regression model for bound water release was established, showing that lower loosely bond EPS (LB-EPS) content and specific resistance of filtration (SRF) may improve dehydration performance, and larger sludge flocs may be beneficial for sludge dewatering.

AB Scale deposition is a common issue in industrial plants, which creates technical problems, i.e. reduction of heat transfer, decrease of flow rate due to an obstruction of pipes. Therefore, the development of some appropriate methods based on well suitable in situ sensors to evaluate and predict the scaling propensity of water is a major concern in current research. This would be a good strategy for the optimization of anti-scaling treatments.
   In this study, scaling tests were carried out using a sensitive sensor, which has been developed using a quartz crystal microbalance with a pre-calcified electrode surface (SQCM). This technique allowed studying the influence of the supersaturation on the scaling rate. The set-up was tested with different water samples which were brought to a given supersaturation coefficient by degassing the dissolved CO2. The prediction of the scaling propensity of water was then possible through the relationship between the scaling rate on a pre-calcified surface and the supersaturation coefficient. In addition, the kinetics of CaCO3 deposit on the pre-calcified SQCM surface was found to be slower for natural water than for synthetic water (same calcium concentration). Furthermore, the activation energy for scale deposit, in synthetic water, was found to be 22 kJ.mol(-1), which may be related to the diffusion of ions and/or CaCO3 nuclei in solution.

AB Benthic Oscillatoria sp. may form dense surface blooms especially under eutrophic and calm conditions, which poses a threat to drinking water safety because it can produce toxic and odorous metabolites. This is the first study to investigate the effect of the conventional coagulant polyaluminium ferric chloride (PAFC) on removal of Oscillatoria sp., and the behavior of Oscillatoria sp. cells in sludges formed from different dosages of PAFC (control, optimum, and overdose system) during storage was also studied. Oscillatoria sp. cells can be removed efficiently by coagulation of PAFC. The adverse environmental stresses of sludge, such as lack of light and anoxic environment, decrease cell viability and induce the increase of superoxide dismutase activity (SOD) and malondialdehyde content (MDA) in Oscillatoria sp. cells during the first 4 days. Because Oscillatoria sp. can adapt to the low-light and hypoxic circumstances in sludge gradually, the cells regrow with prolonged storage time. Compared to planktonic Microcystis aeruginosa and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, regrowth of Oscillatoria sp. during storage may present a bigger threat, even though Microcystis aeruginosa and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii cells will be damaged and release toxic compounds. Growth rates of algae in coagulated systems were lower than that in control system because of the restriction of flocs. It is worth noting that the chlorophyll a level was increased by a factor of 3.5 in the optimal-dose system, and worse, the overdose system increased by a factor of 6 in chlorophyll a after 8 d storage due to the benefit of higher Fe levels. Concentrations of extracellular geosmin and cylindrospermopsin also increased during storage, especially after 4 d, and varied in the following sequence for a given storage duration: control system> overdose system > optimum system. Overall, due to decrease of SOD and MDA in Oscillatoria sp. cells after 4 d storage, algae cells regrew rapidly, especially in overdose system. Hence, sludge should be treated within 4 d and excess PAFC dosing should be avoided. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A stepwise experimental design procedure to obtain reliable data from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) was developed. The proposed procedure aims at determining sets of additional measurements (besides available ones) that guarantee the identifiability of key process variables, which means that their value can be calculated from other, measured variables, based on available constraints in the form of linear mass balances. Among all solutions, i.e. all possible sets of additional measurements allowing the identifiability of all key process variables, the optimal solutions were found taking into account two objectives, namely the accuracy of the identified key variables and the cost of additional measurements. The results of this multi-objective optimization problem were represented in a Pareto-optimal front.
   The presented procedure was applied to a full-scale WWTP. Detailed analysis of the relation between measurements allowed the determination of groups of overlapping mass balances. Adding measured variables could only serve in identifying key variables that appear in the same group of mass balances. Besides, the application of the experimental design procedure to these individual groups significantly reduced the computational effort in evaluating available measurements and planning additional monitoring campaigns. The proposed procedure is straightforward and can be applied to other WWTPs with or without prior data collection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Applying silver nanoparticles (nAg) or silver nitrate (AgNO3) to ceramic water filters improves microbiological efficacy, reduces biofllm formation, and protects stored water from recontamination. A challenge in ceramic filter production is adding sufficient silver to achieve these goals without exceeding the maximum recommended silver concentration in drinking water. Silver release is affected by silver type, application method, and influent water chemistry. Despite a lack of data, there is an assumption that chlorinated water should not be used as influent water because it may increase silver elution. Thus, the objective of this work was to systematically evaluate the impact of chlorinated water (0-4 mg/L free chlorine residual, FCR) on silver release from ceramic filter disks painted with casein-coated nAg, painted with AgNO3, or containing fired-in nAg over a range of ionic strength (IS = 0-10 mM as NaNO3) in the presence or absence of natural organic matter (NOM). Influent deionized water containing chlorine increased silver release 2-5-fold compared to controls. However, this effect of chlorine was mitigated at higher IS (>1 mM) or in the presence of NOM (3 mg C/L). For filter disks painted with nAg or AgNO3, silver release increased with increasing IS (with or without chlorine), and effluent concentrations remained above the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline of 0.1 mg/L even after 30 h (80 pore volumes, PVs) of flow with a background solution of 10 mM NaNO3. Silver speciation (nAg vs. Ag+) was monitored in effluent samples from painted or fired-in nAg filter disks. Results indicated that in general, greater than 90% of the eluted silver was due to Ag+ dissolution rather than nAg release. Additionally, a filter disk prepared with fired-in nAg exhibited a lower % released in the nanoparticle form (nAg = 5% of total Ag in effluent) compared to painted on nAg (nAg = 14% of total Ag in effluent). The findings of this study suggest that chlorinated influent water has minimal impact on silver elution from ceramic filters under simulated natural water conditions, and thus, the recommendation to avoid the use of chlorinated water with ceramic filters is not necessary under most conditions.

AB This study visually tracked the micro-spatial water distribution in bio-flocs of waste activated sludge through in situ synchrotron X-ray computed microtomography. Primarily, the two fractions of bound water, the vicinal water adhering to the surface of organic compositions and the interstitial water mechanically trapped in the net-like structure of bio-flocs, were proposed based on the cross-section imaging results. Furthermore, the determinants on bound water occurrences were explored in terms of viscoelastic acoustic responses of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The joint roles of hydrophilic substance removal, EPS aggregation compaction and colloidal instability of sludge flocs in bound water reduction were confirmed by the strong correlations (Pearson correlation coefficient, Rp > 0.95, pvalue<0.04) among protein levels of EPS, EPS viscosity and bound water contents. Accordingly, providing adhering sites for vicinal water and forming bio-flocs with high viscosity for trapping interstitial water were proposed to be the contributions of EPS on bound water occurrences.

AB A facile approach was adopted to fabricate hydrophobic photocatalytic composite coatings from nano-TiO2 hydrosol and aminopropyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane (NH2-PDMS). A strong interaction bewteen nano-TiO2 and polymers was verified by FTIR and XPS. The photocatalytic activity of the composite coatings was about the same as that of superhydrophilic photocatalytic coating according to the degradation activity of methylene blue (MB). The composite coatings were hydrophobic with water contact angles (WCA) around 120 degrees, which remained stable over 318 h against UV irradiation. The discoloration of contaminated MB on coatings was performed under outdoor exposure indicating quicker color bleaching of MB on composite coatings than that on the controls. The advantages of combining hydrophobic and photocatalytic properties would offer a potential solution as self-cleaning surfaces in various applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB YIG film with thickness of 203 nm was deposited on Si (100) substrates by the magnetron sputtering. A two-step annealing process was employed to fabricate YIG films, which involving two holding process at different temperature. The influences of two-step annealing conditions on crystallinity, microstructure and magnetic properties of YIG films have been investigated. It was found that high-quality crack-free YIG films with excellent magnetic properties could be successfully achieved on Si Substrates by adjusting the annealing conditions. The YIG film prepared by the two-step annealing process with the first-step annealing temperature of T-1 = 750 degrees C and holding time of t(1) = 3 h, the second-step annealing temperature of T-2 = 500 degrees C and holding time of t(2) = 3 h, exhibited a crack-free microstructure and presented excellent comprehensive performances with a saturation magnetization of 127 emu/cm(3), coercive field of 37 Oe and FMR linewidth of 67 Oe.

ID PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; CONCENTRATOR; DESIGN
AB Building Integrated Concentrating Photovoltaic (BICPV) systems make use of optical elements to concentrate the incoming solar radiation on small-sized solar cells with the aim of integrating PV technology into the building. We present a novel conjugate system designed to utilize the merits of both reflective and refractive optics. The optical geometry under study is a dielectric based three-dimensional cross compound parabolic concentrator (3DCCPC) enveloped by a reflective geometry of similar shape whilst maintaining an air gap between them. Monte Carlo ray-trace simulations are used to model and optimize the system configuration. The theoretical analysis shows that the optical performance of the system can be improved by 11% whilst maintaining an air gap of 0.1 mm between the reflective and the refractive surfaces. Experiments are carried out by making a prototype of the proposed system to evaluate the proof of concept. A maximum power ratio of 2.76 was found under standard testing conditions at an incidence angle of 10 degrees. Results show that the average power output from the proposed system increases by 5.46% compared to its predecessor. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We propose a simple and quantitative method to evaluate thickness of crosslinked surface layer (t(x)) for superabsorbent poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) materials using a fluorescent dye of rhodamine B (RhB). The electrostatic attraction between the cationic amine group of dye and the anionic carboxylate group of PAA allows us to measure the fluorescent contrast since the surface-crosslinking causes a significant decrease in concentration of carboxylate group compared to that of inner region. Our method utilizing the distinct adsorption difference of RhB visualizes the crosslinked surface (or shell) layer and successfully demonstrates a direct characterization of t(x) in a dry state of superabsorbent materials, regardless of irregular particle shape.

AB Eryngium foetidum L. leaves extract was used for the nontoxic, cost-effective biosynthesis of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) following hydrothermal route. The biosynthesized ZnO NPs were examined for their antipathogenic bacterial potential against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It showed an excellent antibacterial agent against pathogenic bacteria like Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus susp. Aureus and Strptococcus pneumoniae. The maximum zone of inhibition in ZnO NPs is 32.23 +/- 0.62 and 28.77 +/- 1.30 mm for P. aeruginosa and E. coli, respectively. Therefore, a rapid and eco-friendly route for the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles, with an effective antibacterial activity is reported in this study. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We describe a sol-gel synthetic method for the production of praseodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) nanoparticles suitable for X-ray inducible photodynamic therapy (X-PDT). Our sol-gel based approach was optimized by varying temperature and time of calcination, resulting in nanoparticles that were smooth, spherical, and 50-200 nm in crystallite size. The powders were uniformly coated with a thin (10 nm) layer of silica to facilitate surface conjugation with functional moieties. Measurements of photon flux revealed that coated and uncoated powders emitted a similar photon emission spectrum in response to 50 keVp X-rays. We also determined that the presence of silica did not significantly reduce flux and the emission peak had a maximum at approximately 320 nm. Thus, these YAG:Pr powders are suitable candidates for future in vivo X-PDT studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Practical applications of molybdenum (Mo) and Mo-based alloy have been limited for their weak oxidation resistance properties under oxidizing environments. Anti-oxidation coating technology is a major solution for the improvement of oxidation resistance of Mo. In this study, titanium diboride (TiB2) was deposited as an anti-oxidation coating on pure molybdenum substrate from a gas mixture of TiCl4 , BCl3 and H-2 at 1000 degrees C by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The result shows that good quality TiB2 thin coating has been grown on pure molybdenum and the thickness of the coating deposited at 1000 degrees C for 2 h reached 13 mu m. The TiB2 coating was found to have a typically columnar particle structure and the length of the columnar particle is 1-2 mu m.

TI Fe in P-doped basaltic melts: A Mossbauer spectroscopy study

DT Article
DE Fe environment; Redox state; Basaltic glass; Structure; Stanfieldite

AB The addition of P to a basalt causes a change in the environment of Fe. At low P contents iron is located in the glass structure and the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio is about 80/20. Further addition of P causes a collapse of the glass structure related to a phase separation that triggers the crystallization of a more reduced iron-containing phosphate phase with a crystalline structure similar to that of stanfieldite, and Mossbauer parameters similar to those of the alluaudite group, together with the formation of a Fe3+-Fe2+ disordered phase. Their presence increases the viscosity of the melt. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) were simply synthesized by pyrolysis of citric acid, and zinc oxide nanorods (ZnO NRs) were grown on pre-seeded glass substrates by a solvothermal method. Finally, the GQDs were dropped on the ZnO NR thin film. It was found that the incorporation of GQDs eliminated the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of the ZnO NR thin film, suggesting that electrons of ZnO can be readily transferred to GQDs, contributing to the passing current. Finally, the ethanol sensing analysis was performed, showing that the incorporation of GQDs enhanced the sensitivity of ZnO NR thin film to ethanol gas, and the mechanism behind the enhancement was discussed.

AB An optical nanosensor for measurement and detection of morphine using CdS quantum dots (CdS-QDs) functionalized by antimorphine antibody is illustrated. The prepared nanosensor (CdS-QDs-antimorphine) operates based on the selective host-guest interaction between morphine and antimorphine antibody. It was found that modification of CdS-QDs with antimorphine antibody quenches the primary fluorescence of CdS-QDs according to the Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism. The next interaction with morphine turns on the fluorescence of CdS-QDs-antimorphine. The modified CdS-QDs can be used as selective nanosensor for rapid determination of morphine.

AB In this work, an ultrasonic-assisted semi-solid brazing method was proposed to join Al/Mg. Oxide films on substrate surfaces can be successfully removed even when filler metal was at semi-solid state. A large quantity of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) formed at 460 degrees C because of large amount of Al and Mg dissolved into joint caused by strong cavitation. Decreasing the temperature to 430 degrees C could significantly reduce IMC. However, weak cavitation happened inside low liquid phase fraction at 420 degrees C, making it difficult to break IMCs and solid phases. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In vitro degradation behavior and biological performance of the extruded and aged Mg-6Zn-Mn alloys were investigated by electrochemical measurement, immersion test, cell culture cytotoxicity test, and hemolytic ability evaluation. The electrochemical corrosion indicates that the extruded alloy shows a better bio-corrosion resistance in simulated body fluid (SBF) solution than that the aged counterpart. Immersion test for one month revealed the corrosion rate of the extruded and aged alloys to be only 1.01 +/- 0.10 mm/year and 1.26 +/- 0.13 mm/year, respectively. The cytotoxicity test shows no significant deleterious effects on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) for Mg-6Zn-Mn alloys, indicating a good in vitro cytocompatibility. The hemolysis rates of the extruded and aged alloys are far lower than the safe value of 5% according to ISO 10993-4, which suggests that the present Mg-6Zn-Mn alloys are promising materials for biodegradable implants.

AB We report the liquid exfoliation of an anisotropic layered material: KP15 to form KP15 nanowires with thicknesses up to a few nanometers. Meanwhile, KP(15 )nanowire is the first kind of nanowire that can be prepared by liquid exfoliation. Moreover, sections of the KP15 nanowires are irregular and the longitudinal direction of the KIP15 nanowire is along the direction of the phosphorus tube. Those results may indicate that in-plane phosphorus tubes can also be separated during exfoliation, making the preparation of a few tubes of KP(15 )possible. That could provide a basis for further low dimensional physics research. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Several rare earth (RE)-doped TiO2/Sepiolite (RE-TiO2/Sep) photocatalysts were prepared via microwave-hydrothermal treatment using six different types of RE ions: La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Eu or Gd. The obtained nanocomposites were characterized by using XRD, SEM and TEM techniques. The results revealed that the structures of the nanocomposites were significantly dependent on the radius of the RE3+. Since the radius of RE3+ is much larger than that of Ti4+, the doped RE species were not incorporated into the matrix of TiO2 but rather lie in the grain junctions and boundaries of titania. By forming the Ti-O-RE bonds, the crystallite growth of titania can be inhibited owing to the relatively larger radii of RE3+ ions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined the effect of Ca addition on the selective oxidation of the Al3Mg2 phase in an Al-5 mass%Mg alloy during oxidation at 400 degrees C and 500 degrees C for 72 h. Ca addition led to the formation of the Al4Ca and Laves_C36 phases besides the primary Al solid solution and Al3Mg2. After the oxidation test, there was no significant oxidation in both the Ca-free and Ca-added alloy samples and no visible change in the surfaces between them at 400 degrees C, which is lower than the melting temperature of Al3Mg2 (451 degrees C). At 500 degrees C, the surface of the Ca-free alloy showed the formation of oxide blisters, which was not observed in the Ca-added alloy. The presence of an Al4Ca phase at the grain boundaries led to the formation of multi-element oxides containing Al, Mg, and Ca, which can contribute to the formation of a compact oxide layer.

AB The dry sliding wear behaviors of Mg based nanocomposites were investigated using the ball-on-disk wear tester. The friction coefficient of Mg nanocomposite reinforced with 15 vol% SiC nanoparticles is much higher than pure Mg and AZ31B alloy. Its wear resistance is about 23 times higher than that of pure Mg. Analysis on the surface and debris suggests that the delamination mechanism of Mg has been overcome by the addition of high volume fraction nanoparticles, and the dominant wear mechanism of the Mg-SiC nanocomposites is oxidation.

AB A direct Z-scheme beta-CoOOH/g-C3N4 photocatalyst is rationally designed. The as-prepared beta-CoOOH/g-C3N4 catalyst exhibit remarkably improved photocatalytic performance toward degradation of methyl orange (MO) and phenol compared with g-C3N4 . The efficient electron-hole pairs separation was responsible for the improved catalytic performance. Moreover, center dot O-2 and center dot OH radicals are found to be the key species toward degradation of MO, while holes (h(+)) and center dot OH radicals are the most critical species for degradation of phenol, as proved by the active species trapping experiments and ESR technique measurements. This study provides new insights into the deliberate design of g-C3N4 based photocatalysts with unique photoelectric property. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Self-similar materials can assist in the transition of hydrophobic to hydrophilic state in a well-controlled manner. Herein, we report an ensemble of carboxylic functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) decorated on the self-similar nonwoven surface using a facile, scalable and inexpensive vacuum filtration process for tunable surface wettability. Increasing the amount of CNTs combined with the vacuum assisted nonwoven material reduced the apparent equilibrium contact angle systematically. A simple analytical model has been proposed to predict the apparent equilibrium contact angle by formulating a direct relationship with the structural parameters of CNTs and nonwoven materials. In general, a satisfactory agreement was observed between the theoretical and experimental apparent equilibrium contact angles of CNT decorated nonwoven materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Some chronic illnesses do not show any symptoms at an early stage, which causes a difficult to treating the situation. Especially cardiovascular diseases, liver functions and cancer could be prevented at early stages of diseases by advanced biomedical imaging techniques. In this study, indocyanine green (ICG), which must be stabilized in aqueous media for the development of its use in biomedical applications, was stabilized by encapsulating into the biodegradable polymer of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) using a coaxial electrospinning (CES) method to produce ICG near infrared (NIR) fluorophore nanoprobe with the one-step process.

AB At the present work, a novel two-stage method for the synthesis of zinc oxide (ZnO) films with silicon quantum dots embedded (SiQDs-ZnO) is reported. The experimental procedure consisting on ZnO matrix produced by the sol-gel technique and silicon quantum dots (Si-QDs) synthesized by a green synthesis is described. The incorporation of the Si-QDs on the ZnO films was obtained by spin coating followed by a post-deposition air annealing at 400 degrees C. The XPS results show that the Si-QDs were successfully embedded in the ZnO matrix. The effect of the tunable bandgap (Eg) of the ZnO with the addition of Si-QDs was obtained which is consistent with the Burstein-Moss effect. The enhancement of the photoluminescence (PL) of the ZnO films with the increment of Si content is presented. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is widely accepted that nano pores of sintered nanoparticles can coalesce into micro pores during high temperature service. When applying sintered nanoparticles in power electronics, the pore segregation and delamination seriously degrade the bond strength and thermal conductivity, but the reason is still not well understood. In this paper, both finite element analysis and experimental results confirmed that thermal stress is the main driving force for this phenomenon, which was not considered in the previous study. The effect of pore segregation on performance and reliability of power devices is also discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We have discovered significant temperature anomalies of the linear electrooptical (EOE) coefficients for the K2ZnCl4 nanocrystallites embedded into the polymer matrices. The EOE efficiency was operated by external dc-electric field and UV polarized laser light. The maximal enhancement of EOE output was achieved within the temperature range 375 K-420 K. This temperature range corresponds to existence of incommensurate structural modulation. The maximally achieved field induced EOE efficiency was equal to about 1.4 pm/V for off-diagonal EOE tensor component. The size and NC content dependences have been explored for the size range (20 nm-1500 nm) and contents varying within the 25%-35%. For the sizes about 1200 nm, the EOE is commensurable with the EOE of the bulk crystals and is equal to about 0.6 pm/V. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The as-prepared graphene exhibits a smooth and transparent feature, and possesses high electrical conductivity of up to 2 x 10(5) S m(-1) . Compared with the conventional oxidation-reduction method, the present method is significantly efficient, and, most importantly, does not involve the use of acid and strong oxidizing agent, which will make it more competent in the scalable production of graphene.

AB An increasing amount of waste sodium-based slag was generated during the purification process of metallurgical silicon that causes a posed problem to the environment. Here, a simple but effective approach was developed for the synthesis of mesoporous silicon from waste sodium-based slag. The as-received slag was leached and then calcined to fabricate silica as a precursor. Subsequently, the nanostructured silicon was produced through the reduction of the silica in a magnesium (Mg) vapor. The mechanism suggested that the Mg-containing phases (Mg2Si, MgSiO3, and MgO) were performed as an intermediary agent and facilitated the formation of nano-scale silicon. Nitrogen (N-2) adsorption study of the final silicon product showed a BET surface area of 75.5 m(2)/g and a distributional BJH pore size of 3.7 nm. Significantly, the N-2 absorption capacity of the mesoporous silicon reached 200 m(3)/g. The aim of this study is to recycle the waste sodium-based slag and provide an alternative for the synthesis of mesoporous silicon materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An impregnation approach was used to prepare SmCoO3/SBA-15 composite. SBA-15 was employed as a hard template and SmCoO3 was grown in its pores via sol-gel method. It has been observed that the microstructure, morphology and photothermal properties of the composite powder strongly depend on the hard template. There is a close correlation among specific surface area, elemental composition and properties of the sample. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that SBA-15 plays an important role in the characteristics of the structure, micromorphology and photothermal properties of the composite from the template to the final. This new type composite can be applied in various fields such as environment, energy and chemical industry. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB TiO2 thin film was deposited by Plasma Assisted Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD), and TiOx (0 < x < 2) thin film was synthesized by plasma assisted reduction. The microstructure and morphology of the thin films were determined by SEM and TEM. The crystallization was characterized by X-ray Diffractometer, and surface chemical states were determined by XPS. The structural fingerprint was observed by Raman Spectroscopy, and the magnetic properties were determined by Vibrating Sample Magnetometer in the magnetic field up to 2 Tesla. The results showed that the plasma reduction can result in oxygen vacancies in TiOx thin film, which could bring large impacts on the magnetic properties of the thin films. A higher concentration of oxygen vacancies resulted in larger ferromagnetic behaviors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID GEL
AB Functionally gradient silica aerogels have been applied in many areas with their gradient porosity, refractive indices and acoustical impedance. For the purpose of accurately controlling the process of gradient formation, a new approach called slope-rotation method was proposed. Such a method could benignly fabricate gradient density sol by sloping, rotating and mixing the two different density sols in onestep. Gradient density aerogel was obtained after ethanol supercritical drying. The microstructure and density distribution of aerogels were characterized by nitrogen adsorption, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray phase contrast. The transmittance and refractive index were tested by UV-visible absorption spectrum and a self-built device. The results indicated that the transmittance and refractive index had been gradient changed with the gradient density. This approach was an effective method for the preparation of gradient density silica aerogels and could be suitable for producing gradient density porous materials derived from a sol-gel process.

AB We investigated the carrier transport mechanism at Al/n-type 4H-SiC contacts. As-deposited Al exhibited the good ohmic behavior, while the thermal annealing leads the significant degradation of contact properties, i.e., the specific contact resistance was 3.97 x 10 (3), 4.1 x 10 (2), and 0.153 Omega cm(2) for the as-deposited, 200 and 400 degrees C-annealed condition, respectively. The ohmic mechanism of as-deposited contact could be explained by field emission model, yielding a tunneling parameter of 0.44 eV, i.e., the ohmic behavior is due to the tunneling through the thin barrier. The degradation of ohmic contact after thermal annealing caused by the formation of oxide layer between the Al and SiC. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Zr (IV)-based coordination porous material, EDTMPA-Zr, was prepared and employed for the fabrication of sandwich adsorptive membranes. The removal of Cu (II) from water was employed as a model, and the static adsorption thermodynamic, dynamic adsorption/desorption and reusability were investigated. The results showed that, the adsorption capacity of the sandwich adsorptive membranes was much higher than that of conventional mixed matrix membranes. From the breakthrough curves, the relationship between the removal rate and the filtrate volume was obtained for the first time, from which the appropriate filtrate volume could be determined conveniently. The adsorption capacity did not obviously reduce even after five cycles, exhibiting excellent application prospect in the removal of Cu (II). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A widely known feature of grain growth during powder-bed fusion selective electron beam melting (SEBM) is columnar growth with grains cross many layers along the building direction. Conditions for disrupting this growth direction dominancy have not been well studied. In this study, two different focus offset values were used while other parameters were kept unchanged to result in the shape of melt pool/track being varied significantly and thus the grain growth direction changed considerably for a significant portion of the track. It has been found that as the beam became more focused, the cross section of the melt track became more U-shaped. The lateral heat transfer dominance in top region then resulted in the growth of dendrites, epitaxial and in columnar form, horizontally. The layer thickness of these horizontal dendrites is up to 80 mu m and is significant considering the additive layer thickness being 70 mu m. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chemical interaction in cold-sprayed Zn/Cu composite coating was investigated. Complex hybrid microstructure was formed at the boundaries of the two different particles during cold spraying, including intermetallic compounds (CuZn5 and Cu5Zn8) and amorphous-phase. It's conjectured that the driving force of the reaction mainly came from the kinetic energy released by the impact of the high velocity particles, and the accumulation of deformation energy from the serious plastic deformation of particles.

The scanning electron microscopy results indicated that the Co2Mn(PO4)(2) nanorods have average widths and lengths of 50 nm and 600 nm, respectively. The electrochemical performance of Co2Mn(PO4)(2) was examined in a three-electrode system, which revealed a specific capacitance of 525 F g(-1) at a current density of 1.0 A/g. Importantly, the capacity retention of the prepared Co2Mn(PO4)(2) electrode is 95.3% after 5000 cycles in 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte at the current density of 1.0 A/g. These extraordinary electrochemical performances of the Co2Mn(PO4)(2) nanorods made it an excellent candidate for application in energy storage devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Shape morphology, reproducibly and homogeneity of nanowires were investigated with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Morphological analyses confirm as required diameter, length and aspect ratio. Structurally, body centered cubic (bcc) phase was observed with Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for all diameters. Magnetic investigations are including zero field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) and hysteresis measurement by using physical property measurement system (PPMS).

AB The effects of Zr and Sc on the recrystallization behavior and mechanical properties in Al-4.5Zn-1.6Mg alloy were investigated to understand the strengthening mechanism and to improve the mechanical properties. The results show that the Al-4.5Zn-1.6Mg alloys without the Zr and Sc addition obtained a coarse grain structure; the addition of 0.1% Zr to the Al-4.5Zn-1.6Mg alloy, made it possible to inhibit the grain growth; the addition of 0.1% Sc led to better inhibition to recrystallization through fine precipitates of coherent Al3Sc phases. The precipitation of coherent Al3Sc particles acted to strongly pin the grain boundaries, thereby effectively restraining their migration leading to the higher strength of the Sc-containing Al-4.5Zn-1.6Mg alloy.

AB An in situ silver decoration technique was applied to investigate the effect of microstructure on hydrogen flux in an austenite/alpha'-martensite dual-phase Fe-32Ni-0.2C alloy. Using time-resolved hydrogen mapping, the surface orientation of the body-centered cubic lenticular martensite was found to have a significant effect on hydrogen flux. The hydrogen flux was particularly high at the near-(0 0,1), while it was the lowest at the near-(1 1 1) surface. This dependence of hydrogen flux on the surface orientation is attributed to hydrogen trapping at dislocations in the martensite. Particularly, (1 1 1) twinning-shear in the martensite enhances hydrogen trapping at dislocations, suppressing hydrogen diffusion in the shortest path of grains orientated to (1 1 1).

TI MDOxidation behavior in wet oxygen environment of Al2O3 modified
   SiCf/(SiC + B4C) at 1200 degrees C
SO MATERIALS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Composite materials; Oxidation
AB The influence of Al(2)O(3)on the oxidation behavior of SiCf/(SiC + B4C) composite materials at 1200 degrees C in O-2/H2O (40/60) atmosphere was studied employing Scanning Electron Microscope, X-ray Diffraction and Material Universal Testing Machine. Results showed that Al2O3 could impede the crystallization of oxide (cristobalite) during cooling, and lead to a dense and smooth oxidized layer. Furthermore, the strength retention rate increases from 70.44 to 85.94% with Al2O3 after oxidization for 200 h. The above results are attributed to high viscosity and low reaction activity with steam of the aluminosilicates melt. Therefore, Al2O3 can significantly improve the oxidation resistance of SiCf/(SiC + B4C) composites in O-2/H2O atmosphere. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Freckle defects appearing on the industrial gas turbine blade reduce the high temperature mechanical properties. It is necessary to predict the freckle formation on the castings before the directional solidification. In this paper, the relationship of fluid flow and crystal growth during the vertical directional solidification was analysed. Based on the analysis, a simple method considering the solidification conditions and concaved solidification interface was proposed to predict the freckle formation. The method was verified with specimens and dummy blade under the experimental environments. The validation results show that the method can predict where the freckle may appear on a casting with a large size and complex shape for directionally solidified CMSX-4 superalloy.

ID ENERGY-STORAGE; BATTERIES
AB Molybdenum disulfide possesses a layered 2D structure and a high reversible capacity, which is an ideal candidate electrode for sodium ion batteries. However, the bulk MoS2 suffers from low electronic conductivity and volume variation during cycling, resulting in inferior electrode reaction kinetics and fast capacity decay. In this work, we develop a hierarchical structure comprising MoS2 nanosheets strongly coupled with carbon microtubes (CMTs) derived from cotton by a simple hydrothermal method and a subsequent heat-treatment procedure. The MoS2 nanosheets, the amorphous carbon, and the carbon microtubes in the composite are synergistically building a robust structure, which is favorable for fast sodium ions insertion/extraction and electrons transmission. The prepared MoS2/CMTs electrodes as anodes for sodium ion batteries display stable cycle performance and extended cycle life. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Amorphous carbon (a-C) films were synthesized on quartz substrates through a hot-filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) method. Effect of filament temperature on the thickness, structural, morphological and electrical properties of a-C films was investigated. Both the crystalline quality and sp(2) content of a-C films increased by raising the filament temperature from 1800 degrees C to 2000 degrees C. Sharp increase of the surface roughness was observed as the filament temperature increased from 2000 degrees C to 2100 degrees C. The a-C films deposited at the filament temperature of 2000 degrees C with a high growth rate of 35 nm/min exhibited the optimal quality with a small roughness of 0.546 nm and a low resistivity of 1.67 x 10(-2) Omega.cm. These results indicated that HFCVD is a good method to prepare conductive a-C films rapidly and effectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By contrast experiments, it is found that the pH value greatly affects the chemical component of hydrothermal products, and pure ZnS microspheres can be obtained when the pH value decreases to 3. Compared with the pure ZnS and commercial ZnO, the ZnS/ZnO composite exhibits dramatically improved photocatalytic activities for the degradation of tetracycline (TC) (77.2%) under the visible light irradiation. In the cycling experiments, the ZnS/ZnO composite is also proved to show nice photostability and good photocatalytic activity for 5 runs. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

A large number of TiO2 nanoflakes composed of nanoparticles are perpendicular to graphene sheet, and cross-linked by facade to self-assemble honeycomb-like spatial configuration. These porous are benefit for the absorption of organic molecules, and composite configuration holds the excellent carrier conductivity of graphene facilitating the rapid separation of photogenerated electron-hole pair. This composite shows high absorption of natural light in almost all bands, displaying better photocatalytic degradation activity for antibiotics OTC under man-made natural light than neat TiO2.

AB In this report, we demonstrated fabrication of cylindrical scaffold made of poly (lactide-co-caprolactone) (PLCL) fibers for vascular tissue engineering by the melt-spinning method with use of a commercially available cotton candy machine. This method was able to generate microfibrous cylindrical scaffold with the fiber diameter ranged of 1-17 mu m. It was found that the microfibrous scaffold showed greater mechanical properties including elastic modulus and ring tensile strength than those of cylindrical microporous PLCL scaffold prepared by the phase separation method. Biological test using hMSCs also demonstrated that the microfibrous scaffold exhibited better cells growth behavior including larger cell area and aspect ratio than the microporous scaffold after 3 h culture. Cell proliferation on the microfibrous scaffold was significantly higher than that on the microporous scaffold during 7 days culture. In conclusion, microfibrous scaffold with improved mechanical and biological properties was successfully fabricated using the melt-spinning method. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The B2 -> B19' martensitic transformation in a quenched Ni-rich NiTi alloy was found to proceed under isothermal conditions at temperatures both within and outside of the transformation temperature range as observed during continuous cooling measurement. The variation in the volume fraction of the martensite that appeared during isothermal holding of quenched Ni-rich NiTi alloy at different temperatures T* was measured. It was found that the maximum volume fraction of the martensite (45%) appeared during holding at M s temperature for 30 min. It was found that the kinetics of the isothermal transformation was different for T* > M-s and T* < M-s due to the different structure of the alloy before holding that might influence the mechanisms of the martensite formation.

AB In this study, we report the effects of Na(+)diffusion into TiO2 during thermal annealing on TiO2 photocatalysis. After annealing at 500 degrees C for 1 h, the photoactivity of colloidal sol-based crystalline TiO2 is almost similar regardless of substrates. Interestingly, after the annealing the photoactivity of polymeric sol-based amorphous TiO2 thin film on soda lime glass (SLG) is significantly reduced compared to that on quartz. We observed that Na(+)does not easily bond with Ti-O-Ti in crystalline TiO2, while large amount of Ti-O-Na bonds are formed in the amorphous TiO2 on SLG during crystallization at 500 degrees C. Our results suggest that the control of TiO(2 )photoactivity has applications in improving photo-stability of various optoelectronic devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We characterized the microstructure, explored the formation mechanism, and evaluated the growth of cells in the microscaffold. Moreover, microscaffold blocks were assembled by surface tension-driven assembly to construct engineered tissue with controlled cell distribution and cell interactions.

AB The knowledge of viscosity, which determines the flow of material under applied stresses, is important for many processes of the material production. Data on viscosity of thin amorphous films are necessary for development of molding technology, which allows fast fabrication of various components for integrated optics. Chalcogenide films attract great attention due to their non-linear optical properties and possibility of viscosity variation by light illumination. Despite of importance of data on the film viscosity, no methods of their direct measurements were reported. We propose such method and apply it for measurements of viscosity of As20Se80 chalcogenide films in a temperature range 378-403 K. We have obtained that coefficients of viscosity vary in the range 3 x 10(7)-10(10) Pa.s, with the activation energy 2.9 eV. The thin film viscosity coefficients are 2-5 times smaller compared to those for massive glasses. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Here, polyvinyl alcohol was utilized as both emulgator/dispersant and raw material, and homogeneous polydimethylsiloxane microsphere/polyvinyl alcohol composite hydrogels were fabricated. This strategy avoided the aggregation/adhesion of polydimethylsiloxane microspheres, and provided new thought for compositing the immiscible phases. The as-obtained composite hydrogels showed relatively high equilibrium water content and swelling ratio, as well as enhanced water retention and compressive modulus. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Exfoliated graphite was obtained by thermal treatment at temperatures of 600, 800, 1000 degrees C of expandable graphite based on graphite bisulfate of I, II, III and IV stages. The aim of this work is to study the influence of stage number and exfoliation temperature on macrostructure and microstructure of exfoliated graphite. The delamination of expandable graphite particle is observed with decreasing stage number of initial graphite bisulfate. The obtaining of exfoliated graphite is accompanied by formation of graphite cellular structure. The dependence of crystallite size along c axis of exfoliated graphite on stage number and exfoliation temperature was investigated.

AB The addition of trace La significantly affected the properties of the Al-Zn-Si coating. Adding La improved the corrosion resistance of the coating. More importantly, it restrained the nucleation of alpha-Al dendrites consequently leading to coarser grains. Based on the density functional theory calculations, we found that the doping concentration was important to the spontaneous nucleation of the heterogeneous nucleus in liquid metal, and there should be a transition between homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous nucleation.

AB SnS films present great potential as absorber materials. MgSnO films were chosen as a buffer layer forming a heterojunction with SnS for photovoltaic applications. We investigated the effects of Mg on heterojunction solar cell performance. After amorphous MgSnO films were prepared using sol-gel method, SnS films were deposited using thermal evaporation. The SnS/MgSnO structure showed rectifying and photovoltaic characteristics, although the SnS/SnO2 structure exhibited no rectifying characteristic. The SnS/ MgSnO solar cell reached conversion efficiency of 2.1%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Our aim was to evaluate the effect of minTBP-1-RGD/titanium implant on bony ingrowth in rats. The SEM results demonstrated that the minTBP-1-RGD uniformly covered on implant surface. The implants with untreated surfaces, HF etching surface and minTBP-1-RGD were inserted into the distal femurs of Sprague-Dawley rats. In vivo micro CT analysis showed that the bone mass around implant of the minTBP-1-RGD group was more than that of the other groups and Bone volume/Bone total volume (BV:TV) increased significantly in the minTBP-1-RGD group at the same time point. Histological examination revealed a greater amount of new bone tissue forming around the minTBP-1-RGD-implant complexes and a higher bone implant contact (BIC) rate than the implants of the other groups. These data indicate that the minTBP-1-RGD can promote implant osseointegration, and may be a promising option for further clinical use. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The resultant products were characterized by XRD, FE-SEM and TEM, respectively. The degradation efficiencies of Rhodamine B (RhB) could reach to 99% or more under UV light by all synthesized catalysts-Bi2O3 powders, exhibiting great degradation capacity for RhB under simulated sunlight illumination. In addition, the undamped photocatalytic activity after five recycling runs indicates that the products turns out to be promising photocatalysts with wide applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Scaffolds are used in tissue engineering to provide a temporary structural template for cell colonization and matrix formation. Here, an emerging polyurethane (PU) porous scaffold incorporated with renewable gastrodin was developed, and its mechanical properties and cell behavior were evaluated. The results showed that the scaffold had an interconnected porous structure, the chemical modification of PU by 8.99 wt% gastrodin synergistically enhanced initial modulus by 222% and porosity by 63%; the stem cells seeded on such scaffold exhibited higher cytocompatibility, the proper pore size was favorable for cell attachment and proliferation compared to the scaffold without gastrodin. This study for the first time demonstrates that gastrodin can chemically-polymerized onto the polyurethane matrix, improving mechanical properties and cell activity. The findings in this study highlight that this scaffold holds great promise in regenerative medicine. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The film produced by this method was found to be of high purity and has a homogeneous microstructure consisting of an assembly of numerous aggregates that vary in size from 1 to 5 mu m depending on the electroless deposition time. The electrocatalytic activity of the prepared electrode was investigated for the electrooxidation of formaldehyde using cyclic voltammetry in 0.1 M NaOH solution. Results show that formaldehyde oxidation takes place at a low potential of -0.34 V with large anodic current densities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Highly efficient solar-blind UV detection can be demonstrated in this phototransistor with the photo-responsivity (R) of 1.9 x 10(5) A/W, quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.7 x 10(7)%, photo-sensitivity of similar to 9.5 x 10(5) and photo-detectivity of similar to 8.12 x 10(16) Jones, respectively, irradiated with the 280 nm incident light. The results imply that ZnO NRs/IGZO phototransistor with laser annealing is a promising candidate for the development of highly sensitive solar-blind photodetector. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the underlying literature, bubble coalescence has been so far observed at the latest foaming stages, where bubble growing causes large extensional loads on the polymer film between two neighboring bubbles and eventually leads to the film rupture and to the merging of the two bubbles in a single one. This phenomenon is responsible for the coarsening of the foam morphology and, in turn, the worsening of the final foam properties. Here, the unanticipated, indirect, observation of a bubble coalescence phenomenon occurring at the very early stage of foaming, when most of the blowing agent is still solubilized in the polymer, is reported. Likewise, this phenomenon is responsible for a significant coarsening of the foam morphology. With the aim of investigating this phenomenon, a novel pressure vessel for foaming was utilized, capable of imposing two different cooling histories on two polymer samples, foamed at the same time. Results are presented on polystyrene foamed with carbon dioxide. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB CdS/Si heterojunctions have been fabricated through depositing (002)-oriented grown CdS on the silicon by using a radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering. With increasing deposition times, CdS nanocrystallites are gradually growing. Through analyzing the current density vs voltage characterization, CdS/Si heterojunctions show the rectification effect. The onset voltages, series resistances and ideality factors are heightened with increasing deposition times. However, the reverse current densities are decreasing. For all obtained CdS/Si heterojunctions, the ideality factors are far greater than 1. It is indicated that there are a lot of defects in these heterojunctions. It is believed that through optimizing the fabrication conditions the devices based on CdS/Si heterojunctions will be promising application in the field of optoelectronic devices.

AB We synthesized W-substituted CeO2 (W-CeO2) with a fluorite structure by heating precipitates, prepared from Ce(NH4)(2)(NO3)(6) and (NH4)(6)H2W12O40 aqueous solutions, at 700 degrees C in air. X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence measurements confirmed successful W substitution into CeO2 with a fluorite structure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the amount of Ce3+ in W-CeO2 was increased by W substitution. The lattice constant of the W-CeO2, as determined by Rietveld analysis, increased with increasing W content because of the greater Ce3+ content in CeO2. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy under a CO2-gas flow indicated that the proportion of hydrogen carbonate species on the surface of W-CeO2 with a W/Ce ratio of 1/6 was considerably larger than that of pure CeO2. The CO2 adsorption isotherms measured at 25 degrees C showed that W-CeO2 had a larger CO2 adsorption capacity than that of pure CeO2. Thus, the formation of hydrogen carbonate species improved the CO2 adsorption ability of the W-CeO2. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Titanium dioxide (TiO2) hollow fibers (THFs) were synthesized via a template replication method using natural kapok fiber as a biotemplate. The kapok fibers coated with Ti precursor were calcined at temperatures ranging from 450 degrees C to 750 degrees C, resulting in the removal of the kapok template and formation of a hollow structure. Based on the characterization results, calcination temperature played a crucial role in altering the THF crystal structure, surface area, and functional group. Photocatalytic activity of THFs was evaluated by investigating the degradation of the herbicide paraquat under ultraviolet (UV) light. The correlation between physicochemical properties and photocatalytic activity of THFs calcined at different temperatures was investigated and discussed in detail. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The materials were characterized by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, dispersive energy spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The X-ray diffractograms of the materials are characteristic of amorphous carbon. The palladium doped composite also exhibits the hexagonal phase of the niobium oxide. The chemical elements are evenly distributed on the materials, confirming the dispersion of the doping metals in the material matrix. All composite materials absorb radiation in the visible light region. All composites exhibited photocatalytic activity under visible radiation, except for the iron doped material. The palladium doped material showed superior efficiency in the degradation of methylene blue, due to its lower band gap and higher absorption of visible light. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The influence of stress-induced martensite ageing (SIM-ageing) on the two-way shape memory effect (TWSME) in Ni53Mn25Ga22 (at.%) single crystals was studied. The most effective regime of SIM-ageing (423 K, 175 MPa, 2-3 h) inducing the compressive TWSME with the strain of 3.6 (+/- 0.2)% was established. The stability of the TWSME was investigated at thermal cycling through the temperature interval of martensitic transformations with and without overheating above the SIM-ageing temperature of 423 K. The TWSME strain does not decrease considerably during stress-free thermal cycling. In contrast, overheating above the SIM-ageing temperature on 30 K results in decreasing the TWSME strain down to 1.2%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Perovskite-type BaFe0.9In0.1O3-delta (BFI010) with random distribution of oxide ion vacancy was prepared by Pechini method with sintering under O-2 flow (BFI010-O-2) and N-2 flow (BFI010-N-2). Although crystal structures of the obtained specimens could be explained as the same cubic perovskite, the large variation in oxide ion vacancy content delta was observed between these specimens. Relationship between chemical state of Fe ions and delta was evaluated using Mossbauer spectroscopy at room temperature. It was revealed that valence of Fe was mixture of Fe3+ with isomer shift, I.S., of 0.260 mm/s and Fe4+ with I.S. of -0.073 mm/s with paramagnetic property in BFI010-O-2. Mossbauer spectrum of BFI010-N-2 could be explained that only Fe3+ with antiferromagnetic interaction existed, indicating different phases could be obtained by variation of delta in BaFe0.9In0.1O3-delta in spite of the same cubic crystal structure. It was concluded that oxygen storage phenomenon due to redox variation of Fe ions occurred between the two different phases without variation of crystal structure. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB We report that a gradient structured Zr processed by asymmetric rolling and partial annealing possesses an exceptional synergy of high strength (sigma(y) similar to 550 MPa) and high tensile ductility (epsilon(u) similar to 10.1%) much better than that (sigma(y) similar to 250 MPa and epsilon(u) similar to 14.2%) of its coarse-grained (CG) counterpart. This gradient structure is characterized by a gradient dislocation density distribution from the surface to the core and composed of microscale and ultra-fined elongated grains connected by low angle grain boundaries (LAGBs). These findings can provide valuable insight for designing gradient structures with excellent mechanical properties. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB (Nd,Pr)-Fe-B powders were mixed with Tb13Fe81B6 powders to prepare sintered (Nd,Pr,Tb)-Fe-B magnetic materials. A little amount addition of Tb13Fe81B6 powders leads to a faster increase of coercivity, and the coercivity increases from 14.95 kOe to 18.93 kOe at the mass ratio 9.7:0.3 of (Nd, r)-Fe-B and Tb13Fe81B6. For the mass ratio of Tb13Fe81B6 more than 0.3 the coercivity increases nearly linearly. Both the remanence and the maximum energy product decrease slightly for a little amount addition of Tb13Fe81B6. The investigation by energy dispersive spectrometer shows that though there are dual main phases in the sintered magnets, the chemical compositions of main phase are much different from those of the master alloys due to the atomic diffusion. It is expected to improve the coercivity more largely by optimizing the element distribution in the sintered composite magnets. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present work deal with the development of enhanced amorphous solid bio-polymer electrolytes (SPEs) based on carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) doped ammonium bromide (NH4Br) and plasticized with various composition of ethylene carbonate (EC). The SPEs sample was successfully prepared via solution casting and has been characterized by using Fourier Transform Infra-Red spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) technique. The IR-spectra changes were observed at COO- and C-O-C moiety of the CMC indicate that the interaction had occurred in the SPEs system when EC was added. The highest conducting of the SPEs system at ambient temperature (303K) was achieved at 1.12 x 10(-4)S/cm for unplasticized sample and enhanced to 3.31 x 10(-3)S/cm when plasticized with 8 wt% EC. The increasing of ionic conductivity of the present system is due to the increment of amorphous nature in CMC SPEs system as revealed from XRD analysis. The ionic conductivity of SPEs system was found to be influenced by number of ions (eta), ions mobility (mu) and diffusion coefficient (D) of transport properties based on Rice and Roth approach.

AB Borosilicate glasses (16Na(2)O-10B(2)O(3)-74SiO(2), NBS) with water contents up to 22 mol% H2O were prepared to study the effect of water on structural relaxation using DTA, viscometry and internal friction measurements. The results show that the glass transition temperature T-g of DTA and the isokom temperature T-12, of viscometry are in excellent agreement, confirming the equivalence of enthalpy and viscous relaxation for NBS glass. Combining T-g data with water speciation data demonstrates that OH groups are mainly responsible for the decrease of T-g with increasing hydration, while molecular water plays only a minor role. Internal friction spectra at 7.125 Hz confirm the decisive influence of water on mechanical relaxation. The temperature range of alpha-relaxation (glass transition) strongly decreases while two beta-relaxation peaks (sub-T-g) progressively appear with increasing water content. A high temperature beta-relaxation peak, attributed to the presence of OH groups, shifts from 670 to 450 K as total water content increases from 0.01 to 5 wt%. A low temperature beta-relaxation peak, attributed to molecular water, appears at 380 K and 330 K in glasses containing 3 and 5 wt% H2O, respectively. These findings suggest that relaxation mechanism of different hydrous species at low temperature may contribute to fatigue of stressed glasses.

AB In this study, enhancement of glass forming ability (GFA) as well as mechanical and magnetic properties of a Fe based bulk metallic glass (BMG) was investigated with minor addition of Cu. The obtained results revealed that appropriate addition of Cu could significantly improve GFA of the base BMG. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of the investigated BMG were improved by the addition of 25 at.% Cu due to the positive heat of mixing between Cu and Fe atoms, decreasing the free volume and density of porosities. Therefore, the relatively good and comprehensive properties of the BMG containing 0.25 at.% Cu were exhibited; also, as a result of an excellent combination of good GFA (Delta T-x = 48 K), microhardness (1425 HV), failure strain (epsilon(f) = 2.1%), and failure strength (sigma(f) = 4400 MPa) was created it as a promising candidate for engineering applications. Furthermore, the magnetic measurements revealed that ferromagnetic properties of this Fe-based BMG decreased with the addition of 0.25 at.% Cu, but increased significantly with the addition of 0.5 at.% Cu.

AB Precise measurements of the high-frequency shear modulus of two bulk Zr- and Pd-based glasses in the initial and strongly preannealed states in a wide temperature range are performed. Isothermal structural relaxation of preannealed samples leads to either decrease or increase of the shear modulus. At temperatures below particular temperature T-pc, one observes cross-over relaxation (decrease -> increase) of the shear modulus. The minimal shear modulus attained upon relaxation corresponds to the quasi-metastable equilibrium, which depends both on temperature and thermal prehistory. At higher temperatures T > T-pc, the relaxation always leads to shear modulus decrease towards the "true" metastable equilibrium, which depends only on temperature. The temperature T-pc for both glasses is by approximate to 25 K smaller than the calorimetric glass transition temperature. It is shown that this temperature constitutes the low temperature limit of the linear extrapolation of the shear modulus from the supercooled liquid state. By definition, the temperature T-pc, corresponds to the pseudocritical temperature introduced by Kauzmann in 1948 (W. Kauzmann, Chem. Rev. 43 (1948) 219).
   A detailed discussion of the microscopic relaxation mechanism below and above T-pc based on the Interstitialcy theory is presented.

The glass samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-Visible Spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetrometry. X-ray absorption near-edge spectra at the V K-edge confirmed the presence of the mixing of V4+ and V5+ oxidation states and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to quantify and reveal the amount of V4+ and V5+ in the glass samples with approximately a ratio of 1:4 for V4+:V5+. The paramagnetic behavior were found for the glass samples with x = 1.0 and 2.0 due to the presence of V4+. However, an influence of B2O3 content clearly affected to the glass sample with x = 3.0 resulting to a diamagnetic nature of this glass composition. The local structural information around V atoms in all glass samples were addressed using extended X-ray absorption fine structure technique with a mean oxygen coordinated network of 3.50(1). The notable properties of these glasses can be used and applied in the energy storage applications.

AB The densification rate of glass powder compacts on heating can be calculated by the Clusters model of sintering, in which the particle shape is considered as a correction factor and obtained by fitting the model itself to experimental data. The crystallization of a diopside glass particle compact was characterized by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and the resulting peak compared with the analytically calculated for particles with distinct regular morphologies and constant volume, aiming to access an effective particle shape parameter independently. The crystallization kinetics was calculated for the diopside composition considering heterogeneous surface nucleation and the phase transformation evolving due to a crystallized surface layer, whose thickness grows inward the particles, contracting the residual glass. The crystallization peaks were compared with the experimental DSC peaks for a diopside glass powder with irregular-shaped particles in a narrow size range. The calculated peaks ranged from the same temperature interval of the experimental one, but their overall shape and maximum temperature were greatly influenced by the different particle geometries. The particle shape must thus be taken into account in the analysis of glass powder crystallization by DSC, which is then a promising technique for the characterization of an effective shape factor for glass particles under crystallization.

AB Composite microporous SiO2-TiO2 spheres and micro/mesoporous TiO2 spheres were prepared via the template free two-step synthetic route using aqueous peroxotitanate solution and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as precursors. Both the composite SiO2-TiO2 and pure TiO2 spheres prepared by the solvent-exchange method were initially non-porous, but the applied reflux treatment in water-ethanol suspension successfully transformed them into microporous materials with high apparent surface areas approaching 500 m(2).g(-1) and the micropore volume of 0.17 cm(3).g(-1), while maintaining the same morphology. The prepared composites retained high values of pore volume and specific surface area up to 400 degrees C of thermal treatment temperature. The crystallization of TiO2 into the anatase phase in the mixed oxide occurred only at 700 degrees C, that process was also accompanied by the significant reduction of pore volume, as well as apparent surface area values. The prepared materials were tested as adsorbents for the lead(II) removal; they demonstrated high adsorption capacities, reaching 340 mg(Pb2+).g(-1) Moreover, the mixed silica-titania oxide was found to be more efficient adsorbent at low pH values.

AB A series of simplified glasses were prepared to mimic the United Kingdom's Magnox radioactive waste glasses and determine the separate effect of the presence of Mg on the glass structure and the initial dissolution rate. These glasses had an alkaline earth (Ca/Mg) content of 6.5 mol% and relative ratios of Si, B and Na similar to 25 wt% waste loaded Magnox waste glass simulant. Each simplified glass had similar macroscopic properties, differing only in Ca/Mg ratio. Mg-25 magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectra of the simplified Mg endmember (MgEM) glass (with no Ca) and the full-component simulant glass were similar, consistent with the similar Mg local environments in both glasses. B-11 MAS NMR spectra of the series of simplified glasses showed a systematic increase in the amount of three-coordinated boron (B-[3]) with increasing amounts of Mg. A clear change in the charge balancing of four-coordinated boron (B-[4]) by Mg compared with Ca is observed. However, B-11 NMR measurements of the leached material showed that the additional B-[3] was not preferentially leached from the Mg containing samples. Despite the structural changes in the glass induced by Ca/Mg substitution, initial dissolution rates (r(0)) remained invariant, within error, with Ca/Mg ratio. This indicates that the poorer aqueous durability of Mg-containing Magnox waste glass measured experimentally in long-term leaching experiments, compared with SON68 glass containing Ca, is not caused by a primary structural effect in the glass.

AB Prior research on organizational routines in the 'capabilities' literature has either studied how new routines are created during an exploratory process of variation and selection or how existing routines are replicated during a phase of exploitation. Few studies have analyzed the life cycle of new routine creation and replication as an integrated process. In an in-depth case study of England's Highways Agency, this paper shows that the creation and replication of a new routine across multiple sites involves four sequential steps: envisioning, experimenting, entrenching and enacting. We contribute to the capabilities research in two ways: first, by showing how different organizational levels, capabilities and logics (cognitive and behavioural) shape the development of new routines; and second, by identifying how distinct evolutionary cycles of variation and selective retention occur during each step in the process. In contrast with prior research on replication as an exact copy of a template or existing routine, our study focuses on the replication of an entirely new routine (based on novel principles) that is adapted to fit local operational conditions during its large-scale replication across multiple sites. We draw upon insights from adjacent 'practice research' and suggest how capabilities and practice studies may complement each other in future research on the evolution of routines.

AB This paper explores the influence of innovation on the probability of survival of two hundred top British firms founded throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. To this end, we have collected the firms' significant innovations and classified them by Schumpeterian types, patented and non-patented and domestic and imported. The number of patents registered by the firms throughout their lifetime -a rough measure of their incremental innovation activity- has also been recorded. In addition, twelve control variables - five characteristics of the firms and seven of their business leaders have been included. Both log-normal and gamma duration models have been used in the analysis. They have been estimated, firstly for the whole set of firms and, secondly, for the manufacturing and the service firms separately to control for industry differences. The results of the log-normal and gamma estimations are highly coincident, with some nuances. The significant innovations - particularly new processes, non-patented and domestic ones- have been found to positively influence the probability of business survival. The number of patent applications seems to increase the survival probability of the manufacturing firms, but not of the service ones. Among the control variables, the firm's size, its international dimension, and the age of the business leader at entry seem to be the most influential ones on business survival, although there are some differences between manufacturing and services. The main results are robust to the division of the sample by entry period.

AB We analyse whether public subsidies supporting collaborative research and development (R&D) projects in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are able to encourage persistent R&D investment and interorganisational networking more than subsidies supporting individual R&D projects. Adopting a counterfactual approach to policy evaluation, we compare subsidies for collaborative R&D and for individual R&D implemented in the same Italian region in the same period. Our findings suggest that, once public support is no longer available, the two subsidies have different effects on different types of SMEs. If the policymakers' objective is to increase the number of R&D-performing SMEs over time, they should provide subsidies for collaborative R&D to firms with modest R&D experience. If their objective is to increase the amount of spontaneous R&D investment over time, they should target SMEs with some prior R&D experience, using either subsidy. Finally, if their objective is to induce SMEs to network with external organisations, subsidies for collaborative R&D projects should be preferred to subsidies for individual R&D projects.

AB Whereas business research has focused on the impact of design innovations on market response and financial performance, the sources of design innovations, as opposed to those of technological innovations, have largely escaped investigation. In this research, we examine the organizational, financial, and environmental drivers of design innovations and how they contrast to technological innovations. Our study utilizes a unique dataset encompassing a 10-year window of innovation output drawn from the computer, communications, and audio and video equipment manufacturing industries. Our results suggest that design innovations are driven primarily by investments in research and development and slack organizational resources. Interestingly, we find that design innovations are more prevalent in smaller but fast-growing markets as opposed to technology innovations, which are prevalent in larger markets. Contrary to expectations, we find no association between marketing investments and design innovations. Our research contributes to the extant business literature by considering the sources of design innovations separately from the sources of technology innovations. We also contribute to the literature by distinguishing design and technology patents, developing a deeper understanding of design innovation, and illuminating a lesser understood source of competitive advantage for firms.

AB There is a sharp boundary between basic and applied research in the organizational structure of the US Department of Energy (DOE). In this work, we consider a branch of DOE that was designed to operate across this boundary: the Advanced Research Projects Agency Energy (ARPA-E). We hypothesize that much of energy research cannot be neatly categorized as basic or applied and is more productive outside of the confines of the basic/applied dichotomy; ARPA-E gives us an opportunity to test that hypothesis. We construct a novel dataset of nearly 4000 extramural financial awards given by DOE in fiscal years 2010 through 2015, primarily to businesses and universities. We collect the early knowledge outputs of these awards from Web of Science and the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Compared to similar awards from other parts of DOE, ARPA-E awards are significantly more likely to jointly produce both a publication and a patent. ARPA-E has been highly productive in creating new technology, while also contributing new scientific knowledge. This observation points to the productive overlap of science and technology in energy research and, more generally, for mission oriented research funding organizations.

AB The growing urgency of environmental threats combined with the slow pace of sustainability transitions has turned attention towards a better understanding of regime destabilization. Focusing excessively on niche innovations could be incumbent regimes' diversion and resistance strategy and could reinforce the 'business as usual' mindset instead of contributing to system-wide changes. Historical cases of system transition have most often been used to understand the dynamics of regime destabilization. However, these insights have limitations when the focus is on ongoing transitions. Moreover, it is argued that more attention should be paid to agency and actors. Herein, regime destabilization is understood through an internally structured selection environment, implying that agency is assumed not only in variation at the niche level but also in the selection processes: (1) the selection environment is shaped by active and strategic actors and actor networks; (2) the selection environment is shaped by diverse discursive framings; and (3) the selection environment is shaped by various actors beyond the regime and even beyond the system in question. The argument is empirically tested in the case of the Finnish food system by constructing prevailing storylines in the sustainability transition. Four contrasting but partially overlapping storylines and their associated actor networks are identified. The empirical case supports the view that actors across all levels aim to influence the selection environment's formulation with their framing of the problem and the strategic response. Thus, more attention must be paid to the content and diversity of different discursive framings in sustainability transitions.

AB We investigate numerically the inverse problem of locating small circular obstacles in a homogeneous medium from multi-frequency back-scattered data limited to four angles of incidence. The main novelty of our paper is working with the position of the obstacles as parameter space in the frame work of full-waveform inversion (FWI) procedure. The computational cost of FWI is lowered by using a method based on single-layer potential. Reconstruction results are shown up to twenty-four obstacles, from initial guesses allowed to be far from the target. In experiments with six obstacles, we supplement the reconstruction with an analysis of the performance of the nonlinear conjugate gradient and quasi-Newton methods, in used with various line search algorithms.

AB The classic second-order averaged vector field (AVF) method can exactly preserve the energy for Hamiltonian systems. However, the AVF method inevitably leads to fully-implicit nonlinear algebraic equations for general nonlinear systems. To address this drawback and maintain the desired energy-preserving property, a first-order partitioned AVF method is proposed which first divides the variables into groups and then applies the AVF method step by step. In conjunction with its adjoint method we present the partitioned AVF composition method and plus method respectively to improve its accuracy to second order. Concrete schemes for two classic model equations are constructed with semi-implicit, linear-implicit properties that make considerable lower cost than the original AVF method. Furthermore, additional conservative property can be generated besides the conventional energy preservation for specific problems. Numerical verification of these schemes further conforms our results. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Mobile crowdsensing is a recent model in which a group of mobile users uses their smart devices such as smartphones or wearable devices to cooperatively perform a large-scale sensing task. In this paper, a novel model will be introduced for recognizing/classifying human activities that were collected from sensor units on the chest, legs, and arms. The proposed model employed the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier which is one of the most common classifiers. k-NN has only one parameter, k, to determine the number of selected nearest neighbors to the test or unknown samples for predicting the class labels of the unknown samples. Searching for the value of k which has a great impact on the classification performance is difficult especially with high dimensional data. This paper employs the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to search for the optimal value of the k parameter in the k-NN Classifier. This paper shows first experimentally how the PSO in the proposed algorithm searches for the optimal value of k parameter to reduce the misclassification rate of the k-NN classifier. Then, in the second experiment, ten standard datasets are utilized to benchmark the performance of the proposed algorithm. For verification, the results of the PSO-kNN algorithm are compared with two well-known algorithms: Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Bee Colony Optimization (ABCO). In the third experiment, the proposed PSO-kNN algorithm was employed for recognizing human activities. The experimental results proved that the PSO-kNN algorithm is able to find the optimal or near optimal value(s) of the k parameter which enhances the accuracy of k-NN classifier. The results also demonstrated lower error rates compared when GA and ABCO algorithms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID NETWORK
AB Existing viral-marketing network models commonly assume a preliminary phase in which a marketer actively infects a subset of social network's users, represented by nodes, followed by a passive viral process, in which nodes infect other nodes without external intervention. However, in real-world commercial scenarios, substantial efforts are often invested by companies to promote their products, suggesting that the adoption of products is rarely the consequence of a viral spread alone.
   Under this observation, this paper proposes a new diffusion model, named Active Viral Marketing, which better fits real-world marketing scenarios, where adoption of products relies on continuous active promotion efforts by the marketer. In the proposed model, the success of a marketing attempt to infect a potential customer (uninfected node), depends on the number of adopting friends (infected neighbors) of this user, assuming a user is more likely to adopt a product if more of his/her friends have already adopted it, while taking into account that social influence diminishes over time due to a memory-loss effect.
   The paper further proposes a set of heuristics to schedule the marketing attempts. The main idea behind these heuristics is to utilize the information on the dynamic adoption-states of neighbor nodes, in addition to the static social network topology, when choosing the next node to seed. An extensive experimentation demonstrates how the proposed seeding heuristics improve the adoption rate of products by 30%-75% in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods that mainly rely on the network topology.

AB Sensory data are generally associated with imprecision and uncertainty, and consequently, it becomes difficult to extract useful information from them. The problem becomes even more difficult to handle, when the data are collected using multiple sensors. Realizing the ability of fuzzy sets to deal with imprecision and uncertainty, a multi-sensors data fusion technique was developed in this study by using fuzzy clustering and predictive tools. The data were first clustered based on their similarity using an entropy-based fuzzy C-means clustering technique and the obtained clusters were utilized to develop a fuzzy reasoning based predictive tool. The novelty of this study lies with the application of a clustering algorithm, which can ensure both compactness and distinctness of the developed clusters, and development of a reasoning tool utilizing the information of obtained clusters. Two types of multi-sensors data were used to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. Results were compared with those available in the literature, and the developed technique was found to perform better than the previous approaches on both the data sets. The better performance of the proposed algorithm could be due to its in-depth search of the data set through similarity-based fuzzy clustering followed by the development of fuzzy reasoning tool utilizing the information of obtained clusters.

ID DEFINITION
AB The use of correntropy as a similarity measure has been increasing in different scenarios due to the well-known ability to extract high-order statistic information from data. Recently, a new similarity measure between complex random variables was defined and called complex correntropy. Based on a Gaussian kernel, it extends the benefits of correntropy to complex-valued data. However, its properties have not yet been formalized. This paper studies the properties of this new similarity measure and extends this definition to positive-definite kernels. Complex correntropy is applied to a channel equalization problem as good results are achieved when compared with other algorithms such as the complex least mean square (CLMS), complex recursive least squares (CRLS), and least absolute deviation (LAD).

AB Signature verification has remained one of the most widely accepted modalities to authenticate an individual primarily due to the ease with which signatures can be acquired. Being a behavioral biometric modality, the intra-personal variability in signatures is rather high and extremely unpredictable. This leads to relatively higher error rates as compared to those realized by other biometric traits like iris or fingerprints. To address these issues, this study investigates run-length distribution features for designing an effective offline signature verification system. The objective of this research is to enhance the capabilities of automatic signature verification systems allowing them to work in a realistic fashion by training them using positive specimens (genuine signatures of each person) only without access to any forged samples. Classification is carried out using One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) while the evaluations are performed using GPDS960 database, one of the largest offline signature corpus developed till date. Experimental results show the potential of the proposed system for detection of skilled forgeries, especially for the challenging case of a single reference signature in the training set.

AB The learning algorithm for multivariable data analysis (LAMDA) is a learning method to group or classify quantitative and qualitative historical data. LAMDA can be applied for self-learning and directed learning. Considering self-learning, LAMDA groups historical data through the global membership degrees of a sample with respect to a class, considering the contribution of all features for each sample. Such contribution is called marginal adequacy degree (MAD). To mix all MADs, several aggregation functions such as linear and geometrical connectives are used. The aggregation function calculates the global adequacy degree (GAD) of a sample with respect to a class. This procedure avoids assigning the class number as initial parameter due to that LAMDA applies an automatic threshold called non-informative class (NIC) which finds the best assignment of a portion of data to one class. One improvement for the LAMDA algorithm is the use of a full reinforcement operator called Yager-Rybalov Triple Pi, which can reduce the number of classes. However, this kind of solution ignores the degree to which one sample belongs to one class relative to all samples. Another limitation is that the classes reduction is not controlled by a parameter or an algorithm, which removes some classes required by a human expert. Such removed classes can be useful for the human expert in the data analysis of complex processes or for intelligent systems when the searching of additional information is required in decision-making. In this paper, the typicality degree and the intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) are used to propose one improvement of the LAMDA method in order to develop a strategy that avoids the loss of significant classes. This paper shows two functions: global typicality degree (GTD) and intuitionistic global adequacy degree (IGAD). By integrating both functions, a new function called typicality and intuitionistic global adequacy degree (TIGAD) is proposed. The proposal is applied in three study cases. The results show an improvement of clustering which were validated by the human expert and the information of data. Furthermore, the impact of the research is focused on data analysis, where the expert should make the best decision. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Created by Zadeh in 1965, Fuzzy Set Theory (FST) has been continuously developed in the past five decades and has established itself one of the preeminent approximate reasoning methodologies. In the literature, there exists multitudes of differing approaches for specifying FST's foundational building blocks (such as the various versions of fuzzy set and arithmetic operators) that it has become challenging for an FST user (e.g. an otherwise proficient engineer who is not an expert in fuzzy set theory) to select or tailor-make fuzzy operators truly appropriate for solving his/her problems. In a recent work (Ngan, 2017a), within the type-1 fuzzy setting, a framework termed probabilistic linguistic computing (PLC) has been proposed to empower such type of FST users to understand and dissect fuzzy operators available in the literature, and to tailor-make their own fuzzy operators to solve their own application problems. In this article, we will revisit this work and extend it to the general type-2 fuzzy setting, as well as to other type-2-like fuzzy settings. Among the contributions are: (i) we demonstrate that the generalized PLC framework can indeed provide a concrete, accessible pathway for the FST users to understand and tailor-make their own set operators in the type-2 and type-2-like fuzzy settings - this is distinct from many other theoretical studies within the type-2 fuzzy set (T2FS) literature which primarily focus on deep technical developments while offering virtually no accessible guidelines for the FST users to use T2FS in their applications; (ii) the set operators constructed from the proposed approach are computationally simple and efficient; and (iii) the proposed approach offers a straightforward way to understand the logical relations between set operators for the general type-2 fuzzy sets and those for type-2-like fuzzy sets.

AB Sea buckthorn carotenoids extracted using CO2 supercritical fluids method were encapsulated within whey proteins isolate by transglutaminase (TG) mediated crosslinking reaction, coacervation and freeze drying. The encapsulation efficiency was 36.23 +/- 1.58%, with beta-carotene the major carotenoid present in the powder. The confocal analysis revealed that TG-ase mediated cross-linking reaction enhanced the complexes stability to such a manner that a double microencapsulation was performed. The powder showed an antioxidant activity of 2.16 +/- 0.14 mMol Trolox/g DW and an antifungal activity against Penicillium expansum MIUG M11. Four variants of domestic ice creams were obtained, with a total carotenoids content variation of 1.63 +/- 0.03 mg/g D.W. in sample with 2% powder and 6.38 +/- 0.04 mg/g D. W. in samples with 4% extract, having satisfactory antioxidant activity. The storage stability test showed a decrease in both total carotenoids content and antioxidant activity in all samples during 21 days at - 18 degrees C. A protective effect of microencapsulation was evidenced.

AB Food-derived bioactive peptides have gained attention for their role in preventing chronic diseases. Edible insects are viable sources of bioactive peptides owing to their high protein content and sustainable production. In this study, whole crickets (Gryllodes sigillatus) were alcalase-hydrolyzed to a degree of hydrolysis (DH) ranging from 15 to 85%. Antioxidant activity, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPPIV)-inhibition of the cricket protein hydrolysates (CPH) were evaluated before and after simulated gastrointestinal digestion (SGD). Antioxidant activity was similar among CPH, whereas ACE and DPP-IV inhibition was greater (p < 0.05) in CPH with 60-85% DH. Bioactivity improved after SGD. CPH allergenicity was evaluated using human shrimp-allergic sera. All sera positively reacted to tropomyosin in the unhydrolyzed cricket and CPH with 15-50% DH, whereas 60-85% DH showed no reactivity. In conclusion, CPH (60-85% DH) had the greatest bioactive potential and lowest reactivity to tropomyosin, compared with other CPH and the unhydrolyzed control.

AB This study was carried out to test the essential oil from C. ambrosioides leaves and its main constituent, alpha-Terpinene, in an antibacterial activity assay. As well, it was evaluated ability reduce resistance to norfloxacin and ethidium bromide was compared the Staphylococcus aureus 1199B whith 1199 wild type strain. The MIC of the C. ambrosioides essential oil and alpha-Terpinene were determined by microdilution method. The MIC of the essential oil and alpha-Terpinene presented a value >= 1024 mu g/mL. However, when associated with antibacterials, the essential oil from C. ambrosioides leaves significantly reduced the MIC of antibiotics and ethidium bromide, characterizing an efflux pump inhibition. The C. ambrosioides essential oil, despite having no direct antibacterial activity against the S. aureus 1199B strain, showed a potentiating action when associated with antibacterial agents, this being attributed to an inhibition of efflux pumps.

AB A simple HPLC method was developed for the determination of abamectin (ABA), eprinomectin (EPR), and moxidectin (MOX). Pipette-tip molecularly imprinted polymer solid-phase extraction (PT-MIP-SPE) using poly (1-vinylimidazole-co-trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate) as a selective adsorbent material was studied in detail, including the washing solvent, type and volume of eluent, pH, quantity of adsorbent material and sample volume. The performance criteria for linearity, sensitivity, precision, accuracy, recovery, robustness and stability have been assessed and were within the recommended guidelines. The mean extraction recoveries/relative standard deviation for ABA 1b, EPR, ABA 1a and MOX were 98.77 +/- 3.82%, 88.19 +/- 2.57%, 110.54 +/- 1.52% and 100.42 +/- 0.59%, respectively. Finally, the results proved that PT-MIP-SPE coupled to HPLC-UV is an economical, simple and easy-to-perform technique, and presented a high potential for extraction of macrocyclic lactones in mineral water and grape and juice samples.

AB The berry of Physalis peruviana L. (Solanaceae) represents an important socio-economical commodity for Latin America. The absence of a clear phenotype renders it difficult to trace its place of origin. In this study, Cape gooseberries from eight different regions within the Peruvian Andes were profiled for their metabolism implementing a NMR platform. Twenty-four compounds could be unequivocally identified and sixteen quantified. One-way ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey test revealed that all of the quantified metabolites changed significantly among regions: Bambamarca I showed the most accumulated significant differences. The coefficient of variation demonstrated high phenotypic plasticity for amino acids, while sugars displayed low phenotypic plasticity. Correlation analysis highlighted the closely coordinated behavior of the amino acid profile. Finally, PLS-DA revealed a clear separation among the regions based on their metabolic profiles, accentuating the discriminatory capacity of NMR in establishing significant phytochemical differences between producing regions of the fruit of P. peruviana L.

AB Activated carbon coated with milk proteins was used for the removal and recovery of phenolic compounds from actual olive mill wastewater (OMW). The extraction of polyphenols using the new adsorbent based on natural coating agent has significant potential compared with traditional extraction methods, as it significantly increases the extraction yield (80%) and overall efficiencies of the process for total phenols (75.4%) and hydroxytyrosol (90.6%) which is the most valuable compound. Complete discussions on the adsorption isotherms, kinetic and thermodynamic were performed and the optimum adsorption variables were investigated using the response surface methodology and the central composite experimental design. The extracted polyphenols exhibited a high antioxidant activity and a fast scavenging effect on DPPH free radical. The strategy devised in this work for polyphenol extraction using modified activated carbon with biological coating agent is of simple design, very effective and ensure the recovery of highly antioxidant extract.

AB In this study, dispersive micro solid phase extraction (DMSPE) combined with ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry method was established to extract and determine sudan dyes and their metabolites in real samples. The crown ether microfunctionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was applied as the sorbent in DMSPE procedure. Several experimental parameters that can effect the extraction performance of the DMSPE method were investigated separately by a univariate method. The validation data showed that the limits of detection were in the range of 0.084-13.13 mu g/kg, the mean recoveries were ranged from 80.15 to 103.58% for six samples. Compared with other published methods, the proposed method was more effective, more time-saving and more eco-friendly. Finally, the developed method was successfully applied to enrich and detect sudan dyes and their metabolites in real samples.

AB A novel and reliable method to quantify residual levels of N-(3-aminopropyl)-N-dodecylpropane-1,3-diamine in dairy products using ion-pairing reversed-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed and fully validated. Sample extraction was done with salting-out technique using acetonitrile and sodium chloride. For LC-MS/MS, the analyte was detected using positive electrospray ionization (ESI +) and two multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions were monitored. The method was validated in the 5-150 mu g kg(-1) range using total error approach. Thus, performance criteria of the method were evaluated. Relative standard deviations for trueness and precision were lower than 10%; with the exception of hard pressed cheese at 5 mu g kg(-1) for precision. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was around 5-7 mu g kg(-1) depending on the matrix of interest. The method was successfully applied to accurately quantify N-(3-aminopropyl)-N-dodecylpropane-1,3-diamine in 146 various dairy products with a maximum contamination level of 225 mu g kg(-1) in cheese.

AB 'Calcots', the immature floral stems of second-year onion resprouts, are an economically important traditional crop in Catalonia (Spain). Classical approaches to evaluating the chemical properties of 'calcots' are time consuming and expensive; near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) may be faster and cheaper. We used NIRS to develop partial least square (PLS) models to predict dry matter, soluble solid content, titratable acidity, and ash content in cooked 'calcots'. To guarantee the robustness of the models, calibration samples were grown and analyzed in a first season (2014-15) and validation samples in a second season (2015-16). NIRS on puree spectra estimated dry matter and soluble solid content with excellent accuracy (R-pred(2) = 0.953, 0.985 and RPD = 4.571, 8.068, respectively). However, good estimation of titratable acidity and ash content required using ground dried puree spectra (R-pred(2) = 0.852, 0.820 and RPD = 2.590, 1.987, respectively). NIRS can be a helpful tool for 'calcots' breeding and quality control.

AB Sucrose and its constituent components, glucose and fructose, are major determinants of sweetness in fruits and cooking quality in plant storage organs, such as potato tubers. Accurate monitoring of these sugars provides a predictive assessment of plant product quality. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) coupled to a variety of detectors has been the method of choice for selective detection and quantitation of sugars in plant tissues. However, sugar extraction can be time-consuming to obtain a clean and concentrated sample suitable for accurate quantitation. Herein, we took advantage of a modern HPLC system coupled to a highly sensitive high-resolution high-accuracy mass spectrometer to develop a rapid method for measuring glucose, fructose, and sucrose in plant tissues. The method was validated in mature potato tubers and strawberry fruits and it proved to be highly accurate and robust with minimal sample care requirements.

AB Resveratrol is antioxidant naturally occurring in wine grapes. It is thought to have a preventive biological activity against number of diseases. However, it has been recently shown that in the presence of metal ions, such as Cu2+, resveratrol forms oxidative radicals. Cu2+ is usually present in wine due to former usage of bluestone in vineyards. Fungicide tebuconazole has substituted bluestone and is presently one of the most widely used agrochemicals in wine industry; wine thus may contain traces of tebuconazole. Here, we study the ternary system of resveratrol, Cu2+, and tebuconazole experimentally and theoretically (using mass spectrometry, antioxidant capacity assay and quantum-chemical calculations) to model the redox behaviour of resveratrol in wine. We show that tebuconazole prevents formation of oxidative resveratrol radicals (induced by Cu2+ reaction with resveratrol) via preferential Cu2+ capture and protection of the binding sites of resveratrol. This positive effect of tebuconazole has not been observed before.

AB A non-destructive method for detection of fungal contamination in peaches using an electronic nose (E-nose) is presented. Peaches were inoculated with three common spoilage fungi, Botrytis cinerea, Monilinia fructicola and Rhizopus stolonifer and then stored for various periods. E-nose was then used to analyze volatile compounds generated in the fungi-inoculated peaches, which was then compared with the growth data (colony counts) of the fungi. The results showed that changes in volatile compounds in fungi-inoculated peaches were correlated with total amounts and species of fungi. Terpenes and aromatic compounds were the main contributors to E-nose responses. While principle component analysis (PC1) scores were highly correlated with fungal colony counts, Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) could effectively be used to predict fungal colony counts in peach samples. The results also showed that the E-nose had high discrimination accuracy, demonstrating the potential use of E-nose to discriminate among fungal contamination in peaches.

A simple sample preparation procedure was optimized using a Plackett-Burman design. The method was validated in accordance with Decision 2002/657/EC. Repeatability and reproducibility were less than 10.7% and 16%, respectively, for all compounds. Recoveries varied from 79.8% to 92.0%. CC alpha was 0.019, 54.81 and 54.93 mu g.kg(-1) for CAP, FF and TAP, respectively. CC beta was 0.068, 64.88 and 58.91 mu g.kg(-1) for CAP, FF and TAP, respectively. Limits of quantification (LOQ) were 12.5 mu g.kg(-1) for FF and TAP and 0.15 mu g.kg(-1) for CAP. Nile tilapia fillets (n = 32) analyzed did not contain chloramphenicol. Thiamphenicol was detected in one sample (3.1%) and florfenicol was detected in every sample, all of them at concentrations below the maximum residue limit.

AB Herein, an all-solid light addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS) is presented for determination of cadmium (Cd) in rice. On the working surface of the LAPS, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is introduced as a part of ion-to-electron transducer to improve ionophore behaviors. The composite modification of RGO and ionophore is validated with scanning electron microscopy. The as-fabricated sensor presents a rapid response in less than 10 s to target Cd. Meanwhile, it shows lower noise (0.23 mV) and better limit of detection (0.002 mg L-1) than LAPS (control) without RGO modification (0.37 mV; 0.008 mg L-1). With the proposed method, satisfactory precision, accuracy and selectivity are also established. This method is adopted in an extensive survey for 25 rice samples from 5 regions in China. The results are in very good agreement with those obtained using inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry.

AB The conversion of isoflavones and anthocyanins during black soymilk processing including soaking and heating was investigated. During soaking procedure, the beta-glucosidase activity, content of bioactive compounds including daidzein, genistein, delphinidin and cyanidin were significantly increased by deglycosylation reaction. After heating treatment at 90 degrees C for 1 h, the content of isoflavones beta-glucosides including daidzin, glycitin and genistin were increased through a de-esterification reaction from malonyl-glucosides at high temperature. On the contrary, aglycone content including daidzein and genistein were no significant changed, this result indicated aglycones displayed well thermal stability. Moreover, anthocyanins including delphinidin-3-O-glucoside (D3G) and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) were converted into delphinidin and cyanidin by glucose removal. HPLC analysis suggested that daidzein, genistein, D3G and C3G were bound with beta-conglycinin and glycinin. Our results establish the conversion of bioactive components including daidzein, genistein, delphinidin and cyanidin by deglycosylation during soaking and heating progress and benefit to the production of soymilk.

AB Effects of NaCl concentrations and pH on the intermolecular forces and gel properties of whole chicken egg protein dispersions were studied via solubility, surface hydrophobicity, intermolecular forces, texture analysis, low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) and colour analysis. Results showed that the intermolecular forces involved in the formation of egg gel were regulated by NaCl/pH. The results of gel fracture analysis suggested that the changes of fracture strength and strain were closely related with the internal balance of gel molecular forces. Moreover, a negative/positive correlation existed in the free water/bound water relaxation proportion and fracture strength. These findings provide an important theoretical basis for the innovation of heat-induced egg gel products.

AB Human-derived dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) is a costly material used in the discovery of drugs for diabetes. In this study, we demonstrated the efficacy of DPPIV from Aspergillus oryzae as an alternative to human-derived DPPIV for identifying DPPIV inhibitors. Fermented soybean, also called natto, suppresses blood glucose levels in humans; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. This study determined the in vitro DPPIV inhibitory activity of isolated peptides from natto. Amino acid sequences of two peptides isolated from natto were identified by LC/MS/MS as Lys-Leu and Leu-Arg. These isolated peptides inhibited DPPIV in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 41.40 +/- 2.68 and 598.02 +/- 18.35 mu g/ml, respectively. These results indicate the potential mechanism of blood glucose control by natto and novel roles of Lys-Leu and Leu-Arg as DPPIV inhibitors.

AB Rocket is rich in glucosinolates and valued for its hot and spicy taste. Here we report the structure elucidation, bioactivity, and stability of the mainly formed glucosinolate hydrolysis product, namely sativin, which was formerly thought to be 4-mercaptobutyl isothiocyanate. However, by NMR characterization we revealed that sativin is in fact 1,3-thiazepane-2-thione, a tautomer of 4-mercaptobutyl isothiocyanate with 7-membered ring structure and so far unknown. This finding was further substantiated by conformation sampling using molecular modeling and total enthalpy calculation with density functional theory. During aqueous heat treatment sativin in general was quite stable, while the isothiocyanates erucin and sulforaphane were labile, having half-lives of 132 min and 56 min (pH 5, 100 degrees C), respectively. Moreover, using a WST-1 assay, we found that sativin did not reduce cell viability of HepG2 cells in a range of 0.3-30 mu M, and, therefore, exhibited no cytotoxic effects in this cell line.

AB This work aimed to compare the flavor characteristics of Vidal icewines from China and Canada and to establish relationships between sensory descriptors and chemical composition. Descriptive analysis was performed with a trained panel to obtain the sensory profiles. Thirty important aroma-active compounds were quantified by four different methodologies. Partial least squares discriminant analysis was used to identify candidate compounds, which were unique to certain sensory descriptors. The sensory profiles of icewines from China were characterized by nut and honey aromas, while icewines from Canada expressed caramel and rose aromas. Nut and honey aromas had a close correlation with 1-hexanol, isoamyl acetate, phenethyl acetate and phenylethyl alcohol. Caramel aroma was correlated with ethyl esters and lactones and rose aroma was correlated with terpenes.

AB Pomegranate peel (PoP), a juice byproduct often considered as a waste, comprises nearly around 30-40% portion of the fruit. Phenolic compounds (one class of bioactive phytochemicals) are primarily concentrated in the peel portion of pomegranate fruit. In PoP, the main phenolic compounds reported in the literature include flavonoids (anthocyanins such as pelargonidin, delphinidin, cyanidin along with their derivatives and anthoxanthins such as catechin, epicatechin and quercetin), tannins (ellagitannins and ellagic acid derivatives such as punicalagin, punicalin and pedunculagin) and phenolic acids (such as chlorogenic, caffeic, syringic, sinapic, p-coumaric, ferulic, ellagic, gallic and cinnamic acid). It is generally accepted that phenolic compounds can be more efficiently recovered from PoP by improving the extraction efficiency. The curative relevance of these compounds has been mainly assessed by in vitro experimentation. Therefore, conclusive clinical trials of the phenolic compounds present in PoP are essential for correct validation of their health benefits.

AB Zipper-like on/off-switchable and magnetic molecularly imprinted microspheres (SM-MIMs) were constructed using acrylamide (AAm) and 2-acrylamide-2-methyl propanesulfonic acid (AMPS) as functional monomers for 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta-E-2) recognition and extraction. The imprinted polymer interactions between poly(AAm) (PAAm) and poly(AMPS) (PAMPS) with on/off-switchable property to temperature, exhibited dissociation at relatively higher temperatures (such as 30 degrees C) and helped 17 beta-E-2 enter into imprinted sites, leading to higher binding capability. Conversely, the interpolymer complexes between PAAm and PAMPS formed and blocked 17 beta-E-2 access to imprinted sites at lower temperature (such as 20 degrees C). SM-MIMs were used as dispersive solid phase extraction (SPE) adsorbent with HPLC for 17 beta-E-2 pretreatment and detection in food samples, and low limit detection (2.52 mu g L-1) and quantification (10.76 mu g L-1) with higher recovery were obtained. Therefore, SM-MIMs may be a promising adsorbent for 17 beta-E-2 pretreatment in food samples owing to its advantages of on/off-switchable recognition, eco-friendly elution, and efficient separation.

AB A simple analytical method using ion-exchange chromatography (IEC) coupled with capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) was newly developed for detection and quantification of parvalbumin (PV), a major allergen, in fish. The procedure of IEC for simple enrichment of PV crude extract was optimized. By using 25 mmol/L borate-borax buffer with 15 kV separation voltage at pH 9.2 for CZE separation, the migration time, separation efficiency and electrophoretic resolution greatly improved. Under the optimal conditions, PV was determined in 2.8 min, with the limit of detection (LOD) at 0.71 mu g/mL (S/N= 3) and the recoveries at 89.6%-104.7%. We also found that only when the concentration of PV was above LOD reported here was the protein capable of stimulating human mast cell degranulation, indicating the biological significance of the LOD. Finally, the use of this method to analyze fish samples with simple sample preparation highlights the applicability for detection of allergens in seafood matrices.

AB We presented a signal amplified lateral flow assay (LFA) based on magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) labeled dual-probe and applied it in the high sensitive and rapid on-site detection of furazolidone metabolite of 3-amino-2-oxazolidinone (AOZ). The amplified signal benefited from high affinity between two probes of MNPs labeled murine monoclonal antibody (MNPs-MAb) and goat anti-mouse antibody (MNPs-GAMA) and was achieved by the generation of dual-probe network complex. This developed method could realize high sensitive detection of AOZ with a threshold value of 0.88 ng mL(-1) and a detection limit of 0.044 ng mL(-1), the sensitivity was at least 10-fold improved than that of the traditional gold nanoparticle based LFA. This facile developed assay was successfully applied for rapid detection of AOZ in milk samples. The proposed method paves a new way for on-site screening of other hazardous substances in food and can be referred in all lateral flow assays.

AB Vitamin D3 levels are known to sometimes decline in fortified products, which could be due to its degradation, although the exact mechanism is unknown. In this study, the influence of processing and storage conditions on lipid oxidation and vitamin D3 degradation were studied. Simulated whole milk powders with and without heat treatment were stored for 12 months at two different storage temperatures (20 degrees C and 40 degrees C). Stored samples without heat treatment showed higher lipid oxidation products analyzed by PV and TBARS values compared to those with heat treatment. Higher storage temperature also resulted in higher levels of lipid oxidation products. The concentration of vitamin D3 was also analyzed using UHPLC-MS/MS after PTAD derivatization in stored samples. An inverse relationship was observed between lipid oxidation products and vitamin D3 content. Finally, previtamin D3 and vitamin D3 oxidation products were quantified in stored samples using MRM analysis.

AB Cashew gum and maltodextrin microcapsules containing green tea leaf extracts were made using a spray-dryer. Green tea extracts were submitted to cytotoxicity analysis and characterization of bioactive compounds. Three formulations of microcapsules were performed, which were then submitted to characterization through morphological study, particle diameter and distribution, zeta potential, Exploratory Differential Calorimetry, entrapment efficiency, dissolution test and X-ray diffraction. The extract had a high bioactive compound content and no cytotoxicity was observed. The amorphous microcapsules presented irregular shapes with a circular predominance and dentate surface, mean diameters varying from 2.50 to 3.64 mu m, solubility ranging from 63% to 72.66%. Low values of microencapsulation efficiency, zeta potencial and dissolution profile were observed. The microparticles based on the dry extract of green tea present potential as a food ingredient and as a promoter of health benefits.

AB Several analytical methods are available to evaluate virgin olive oil (VOO) minor compounds; however, multi-class methodologies are yet rarely studied. Herewith, LC-MS and GC-MS platforms were used to develop two methods capable of simultaneously determine more than 40 compounds belonging to different VOO minor chemical classes within a single run. A non-selective and highly efficient liquid-liquid extraction protocol was optimized for VOO minor components isolation. The separation and detection conditions were adjusted for determining phenolic and triterpenic compounds, free fatty acids and tocopherols by LC-MS, plus sterols and hydrocarbons by GC-MS. Chromatographic analysis times were 31 and 50 min, respectively. A comparative assessment of both methods in terms of analytical performance, easiness, cost and adequacy to the analysis of each class was carried out. The emergence of this kind of multi-class analytical methodologies greatly increases throughput and reduces cost, while avoiding the complexity and redundancy of single-chemical class determinations.

AB Effects of different moisture contents and oxidised compounds on the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of lecithin were determined in bulk oils and in medium-chain triacylglycerols (MCT). CMC of lecithin in MCT was significantly higher than that in other vegetable oils including olive, soybean, corn, and rapeseed oils (p<0.05). Presence of moisture significantly affected the CMC of lecithin in MCT (p<0.05). CMC of lecithin was high when the moisture content was below 900 ppm, whereas at a moisture content of 1000 ppm, CMC of lecithin decreased significantly (p<0.05), and then started to increase. Addition of total polar materials (TPM), which are oxidation products, at 3 and 5% concentrations, decreased CMC of lecithin significantly (p<0.05) in MCT, compared to when 0, 1, and 1.5% of TPM was added to MCT. As the degree of oxidation increased in corn oil, CMC of lecithin gradually decreased. Additionally, under different moisture contents, corn oils showed a similar pattern of CMC of lecithin in MCT, whereas oxidised corn oil had a little lower CMC of lecithin than unoxidised corn oil. The results clearly showed that the concentration of lecithin for the formation of micelles is greatly influenced by the presence of oxidation products and the moisture content in bulk oils.

AB Antioxidant dietary fiber extracted from spent coffee grounds (FSCG) was evaluated as a potential functional food ingredient when incorporated in a food model (biscuits), and digested in vitro under simulated human gastrointestinal conditions. FSCG added to biscuits increased its total dietary fiber, antioxidant capacity after in vitro digestion, bioaccessibility of phenolic compounds (gallic acid and catechin) and amino acids. Furthermore, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), involved in chronic diseases, decreased up to 6-folds in the biscuits containing FSCG when compared with the traditional biscuit. The digestible fraction of biscuits containing the highest amount of FSCG (5 g) displayed the higher inhibiting alpha-glucosidase activity, correlating with the bioaccessibility of ascorbic acid and catechin. Our study seems to indicate that anti-diabetic compounds may be released in the small intestine during FSCG digestion, where biscuits containing FSCG may be able to beneficially regulate sugar metabolism thereby helping in producing foods friendly for diabetes.

AB Acidified water extraction of total anthocyanin content, total phenol content and 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline- 6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) scavenging activity from black soybeans (Glycine max [L.] Merr. Cheongja4ho) was optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). A five-level, three-factor central composite design was employed to optimize the conditions for the maximum yields of these three components using19 different experiments. The HCl concentration (0.3-0.5%), solid-liquid ratio (1/30-1/50 g/mL) and extraction temperature (30-50 degrees C) significantly affected three components. The optimized conditions were HCl concentration of 0.359%, solid-liquid ratio of 1/54.2 g/mL and extraction temperature of 56.8 degrees C for total anthocyanin content (136.68 mg/100 g), total phenol content (1197.09 mg/100 g) and ABTS(+) scavenging activity (211.65 mg/100 g). These experimental values fit well with the predicted values. Among three anthocyanins found in the black soybean extracts, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside was the major one (65-73% of the total), followed by petunidin-3-O-glucoside (17-23%) and delphinidin-3-O-glucoside (10-12%).

AB In this study, bovine serum albumin (BSA)-caffeic acid (CA) conjugate was prepared with free radical-induced grafting method. The CA to BSA ratio of the conjugate was 115.7 mg/g. In vitro antioxidant activity assays suggested that BSA-CA conjugates had stronger antioxidant activity than BSA. Resveratrol-loaded zein encapsulated with BSA and BSA-CA conjugate core-shell nanoparticles were prepared with antisolvent method. Particle sizes were 206.3 nm, and 217.2 nm for BSA and BSA-CA, respectively. The encapsulation efficiencies (EEs) were 85.3% and 86.5% for zein-BSA and zein-BSA-CA nanoparticles, respectively. SEM results indicated that both nanoparticles were spherical with mean diameter approximately 200 nm and smooth surfaces. Both thermal and UV light stability of resveratrol was significantly improved after nanoencapsulation. BSA-CA conjugate showed remarkably greater protection than BSA against resveratrol degradation. Cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) study confirmed that resveratrol in both zein-BSA and zein-BSA-CA nanoparticles had significant higher antioxidant activities than resveratrol alone.

AB In this study, the hydrolysis of a pecan protein isolate (PPI) with Alcalase was carried out to generate antioxidant peptides. We proposed a kinetic model to illustrate the enzymolysis process of PPI, which was found suitable for depiction of the kinetic behavior for PPI hydrolysis by Alcalase. The PPI hydrolysis products were gradually fractionated by ultrafiltration through cut-off membranes with molecular weights of 10, 5 and 3 kDa and their antioxidant activities were evaluated in vitro. Further, the strongest antioxidant fraction (< 3 kDa) and novel antioxidative peptide were successfully purified. The amino acid sequence of the purified peptide was identified as LAYLQYTDFETR. The purified fraction exhibited appreciable scavenging activities on ABTS radical (67.67%), DPPH radical (56.25%) and hydroxyl radical (47.42%) at 0.1 mg/mL. The results suggested that this novel peptide may serve as a potential antioxidant and it should be evaluated for development of functional foods and pharmaceuticals products.

AB The formulation, physicochemical stability and bioaccessibility of astaxanthin (AST) loaded oil-in-water nanoemulsions fabricated using gypenosides (GPs) as natural emulsifiers was investigated and compared with a synthetic emulsifier (Tween 20) that is commonly applied in food industry. GPs were capable of producing nanoemulsions with a small volume mean diameter (d(4,3) = 125 +/- 2 nm), which was similar to those prepared using Tween 20 (d(4,3) = 145 +/- 6 nm) under the same high-pressure homogenization conditions. GPs-stabilized nanoemulsions were stable against droplet growth over a range of pH (6-8) and thermal treatments (60-120 degrees C). Conversely, instability occurred under acidic (pH 3-5) and high ionic strength (25-100 mM CaCl2) conditions. In comparison with Tween 20, GPs were more effective at inhibiting AST from degradation during 30 days of storage at both 5 and 25 degrees C. However, GPs led to lower lipid digestion and AST bioaccessibility from nanoemulsions than did Tween 20.

AB The objective of the present study was to improve the utilization of scallop (Chlamys farreri) byproducts by using Maillard reaction. Scallop mantle hydrolysates (SMHs) were prepared using neutrase then reacted with ribose. Thirty-four peptides were identified from SMHs by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, and the abundance of Asp and Lys suggested the strong Maillard reactivity. The formation of Schiff's base as well as modification of amide I, II and III bands in Maillard reaction products (MRPs) was confirmed by ultraviolet-visible, fluorescence, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Thirty volatile compounds were produced by the reaction of SMHs with ribose. Moreover, MRPs with enhanced radical scavenging and anti-linoleic acid peroxidation activities over SMHs promoted the survival and reduced the DNA damage of HepG2 cells treated with hydrogen peroxide. These results suggest that SMHs-ribose MRPs can be potentially used as food antioxidant for suppressing of lipid oxidation or protecting of cell from oxidative damage.

AB To evaluate if the recently identified antimicrobial milk peptides alpha(S2)-casein(182-207) and alpha(S2)-casein(151-181) can be of physiological or technological relevance, their presence in commercial milk was investigated. Thus, a UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS scheduled multiple reaction monitoring method was developed for quantification using stable isotope-labeled peptides. The developed protocol gave very good linear response (R-2 > 0.99) for both peptides, recovery > 95% and coefficients of variations of 5.51% and 4.79%. The limits of detection (0.3 nM alpha(S2)-casein(182-207) and 0.5 nM alpha(S2)-casein(151-181)) were low enough to detect both peptides without further enrichment. The highest peptide concentration was recorded in pasteurized milk (1.36 mu M alpha(S2)-casein(182-207) and 0.20 mu M alpha(S2)-casein(151-181)). The concentration of alpha(S2)-casein(182-207) was in a range that was previously reported to act bacteriostatic against Bacillus subtilis. Industrial milk processing led to a significant loss of both peptides resulting in a mean concentration of 0.47 mu M alpha(S2)-casein(182-207) and 0.098 mu M alpha(S2)-casein(151-181) in ultrahigh-temperature milk.

AB Two Verdelho and Petit Verdot wines were produced from sequential harvests of grapes. The alcohol concentration of early harvest (EH) and late harvest (LH) wines were respectively 9% and 13.5% v/v for Verdelho, and 10.5% and 13% v/v for Petit Verdot. LH wines were dealcoholised to match the same alcohol level of EH samples using a combined reverse osmosis-evaporative perstraction process. In dealcoholised wines, there was a decrease in volatile compounds (esters particularly) compared to LH treatments. For both varieties, the sensory attribute ratings for overall aroma intensity and alcohol mouthfeel also decreased following dealcoholisation. Dealcoholised wines were distinctively different from both LH and EH wines even though these wines had similar alcohol level to EH wines. When dealcoholisation is considered for high-alcohol wines, it is important to consider that membrane effects can significantly change depending on the wine non-volatile matrix composition and the level of alcohol reduction required.

AB Powdery mildew of wheat is one of the major foliar diseases, causing significant yield loss and flour quality change. In this study, grain protein and starch response to powdery mildew infection were investigated. Total protein, glutenin and gliadin exhibited a greater increase in grains from infected wheat, while the content of total starch and amylopectin was decreased. Comparative proteomic analysis demonstrated that the overabundant protein synthesis-related proteins might facilitate the accumulation of storage proteins in grains from infected plants. The significant increase in triticin, serpin and HMW-GS in grains from infected wheat might relate to the superior gluten quality. In addition, overabundant carbohydrate metabolism-related proteins in grains from infected wheat were conducive to the depletion of starch, whereas the decreased abundance of ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase might be related to the deficiency of starch synthesis. These results provide a deeper understanding on the change of wheat quality under powdery mildew infection.

AB This work explores the potential of multi-element fingerprinting in combination with advanced data mining strategies to assess the geographical origin of extra virgin olive oil samples. For this purpose, the concentrations of 55 elements were determined in 125 oil samples from multiple Spanish geographic areas. Several unsupervised and supervised multivariate statistical techniques were used to build classification models and investigate the relationship between mineral composition of olive oils and their provenance. Results showed that Spanish extra virgin olive oils exhibit characteristic element profiles, which can be differentiated on the basis of their origin in accordance with three geographical areas: Atlantic coast (Huelva province), Mediterranean coast and inland regions. Furthermore, statistical modelling yielded high sensitivity and specificity, principally when random forest and support vector machines were employed, thus demonstrating the utility of these techniques in food traceability and authenticity research.

AB A novel liquid-phase microextraction based on the ferrofluid was successfully applied for the extraction and determination of four phenolic compounds (bisphenol-A, bisphenol-AF, tetrabromobisphenol-A and 4-tert-octylphenol) in milks and fruit juices. In this study, a range of alkyl (C-4-C-10) alcohols as the carrier liquid were used for the preparation of ferrofluids. The study showed that an appropriate chain length of alkyl alcohol may improve the extraction efficiency and maintain the integrity of ferrofluids during extraction, so 1-heptanol (C-7) was selected as the optimal carrier liquid. Specifically, the effects of various parameters on the extraction of phenolic compounds were investigated and optimized. Under the optimized conditions, the limits of detection were between 0.35 and 0.66 mu g L-1. The intra-day and inter-day precision (RSD %) for the analytes at 10 and 50 mu g L-1 were in the range of 3.2-6.7 % and 2.9-7.1%, respectively.

AB Carotenoids are valuable natural colorants that exhibit numerous health promoting properties, and thus are widely used in food, feeds, pharmaceutical and nutraceuticals industries. In this study, we isolated and identified novel microbial sources that produced high-value carotenoids using high throughput screening (HTS). A total of 701 pigmented microbial strains library including marine bacteria and red yeast was constructed. Carotenoids profiling using HPLC-DAD-MS methods showed 88 marine bacterial strains with potential for the production of high-value carotenoids including astaxanthin (28 strains), zeaxanthin (21 strains), lutein (1 strains) and canthaxanthin (2 strains). A comprehensive 16S rRNA gene based phylogenetic analysis revealed that these strains can be classified into 30 species belonging to five bacterial classes (Flavobacteriia, alpha-Proteobacteria, gamma-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacilli). Importantly, we discovered novel producers of zeaxanthin and lutein, and a high diversity in both carotenoids and producing microbial strains, which are promising and highly selective biotechnological sources for high-value carotenoids.

AB This study examined the monthly and seasonal variations of delta C-13, delta N-15, fatty acids (FAs), and vitamin E in organic milk (OM) and conventional milk (CM) collected in Korea during 2016-2017, discriminating OM authenticity with chemometric approaches. Compared to CM, the mean d(13)C and delta N-15 values were lower in OM, whereas the mean alpha-tocopherol and nutritionally desirable FA contents were higher in OM. Furthermore, delta C-13, delta N-15, and FA contents vary significantly with the season in OM, whereas alpha-tocopherol does not show a specific seasonal trend in either OM or CM. Chemometric approaches provided reliable chemical markers, notably C18:3n-3, C18:2n-6, and delta C-13(bulk-milk), for accurate OM discrimination according to sampling season. Our findings elucidate milk nutritional quality issues and also provide valuable insight into the control of fraudulent OM labeling in Korea, with potential application in other countries.

AB The esters of beta-sitostanol and fatty acids are known for their effect as cholesterol-lowering agents. In this work, the efficiency of three lipases as biocatalysts of the esterification of beta-sitostanol and C16 and C18 fatty acids was compared. The sterol esterase of Ophiostoma piceae (OPEr) yielded the highest esterification rates and was selected for further optimization of the reaction. The effects of four parameters (temperature, enzymatic dosage, acyl donor concentration, and reaction time) on ester synthesis were investigated and the process conditions were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). The best conditions for esterification for each fatty acid were predicted using a second-order model, and experimentally validated. Very high esterification efficiencies (86-97%) were observed using the predicted values for the four variables. This approach was shown to be suitable for optimizing the enzymatic production of beta-sitostanol esters, which represents a green alternative to the chemical synthesis of these dietary complements.

AB Ageing on lees (AOL) is a technique that increases volatile compounds, promotes colour stability, improves mouthfeel and reduces astringency in red wines. The main drawback is that it is a slow process. Several months are necessary to obtain perceptible effects in wines. Different authors have studied the application of new techniques to accelerate the AOL process. Ultrasound (US) has been used to improve different food industry processes; it could be interesting to accelerate the yeast autolysis during AOL. This work evaluates the use of the US technique together with AOL and oak chips for this purpose studying the effects of different oenological parameters of red wines. The results obtained indicate an increase of polysaccharides content when US is applied in wine AOL. In addition, total polyphenol index (TPI) and volatile acidity were not affected. However, this treatment increases the dissolved oxygen affecting the volatile compounds and total anthocyanins.

AB Seasonal variations in crops can alter the profile and amount of constituent compounds and consequentially any biological activity. Differences in phytochemical profile, total phenolic content and inhibitory activity on alpha-glucosidase (maltase) of Hibiscus sabdariffa calyces grown in South Western Nigeria were determined over wet and dry seasons. The phenolic profile, organic acids and sugars were analysed using HPLC, while inhibition of rat intestinal maltase was measured enzymically. There was a significant increase (1.4-fold; p <= 0.05) in total anthocyanin content in the dry compared to wet planting seasons, and maltase inhibition from the dry season was slightly more potent (1.15-fold, p <= 0.05). Fructose (1.8-fold), glucose (1.8-fold) and malic acid (3.7-fold) were significantly higher (p <= 0.05) but citric acid was lower (62-fold, p <= 0.008) in the dry season. Environmental conditions provoke metabolic responses in Hibiscus sabdariffa affecting constituent phytochemicals and nutritional value.

AB The influence of alkali extraction conditions on the formation of lysinoalanine (LAL) and the structural characterization of lysinoalanine-containing protein in rice residue protein isolates (RRPI) were explored in this study. It was found that LAL content increased from 0.256 to 13.079 g/kg as NaOH concentration increased from 0.03 to 0.09M and then decreased to 1.541 g/kg at 0.13M NaOH. The extraction temperature and time were found to have a positive correlation with LAL content. The highest LAL content (25.679 g/kg) was observed with alkali extraction using 0.09M NaOH at 75 degrees C for 120 min. The comparative structural analysis results showed that alkali treatment could degrade cystine, lysine, threonine and arginine to generate LAL; increasing alkali content would cause variations in secondary structure and micropore appearance on the surface of lysinoalanine-containing protein, whereas increasing alkali treatment temperature and time could enlarge the surface particle size of the protein.

AB The effect of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) (450-550-650 MPa/5-10-15 min) on polyphenols profile of puree obtained from commercial tomato varieties (Maliniak, Cerise, Black Prince and Lima) was investigated. Individual polyphenols, total phenolic index (TPI) were quantified using a mass spectrometer (HPLC-MS/MS). Photochemiluminescence (PCLACW), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays were used to determine the antioxidant capacity of the hydrophilic extract. The results demonstrated that at certain processing conditions, HHP may enhance or decrease the nutritional quality of tomato puree. However, the tomato variety was a key factor influencing the polyphenols profile and the antioxidant capacity. A significant positive correlation was found among TPI, FRAP or CV parameters and the concentration of caffeic, ferulic, sinapic and p-coumaric acids, and epicatechin. On the other hand, significant positive correlation was observed among antioxidant capacity (PCLACW), TPC, rutin and naringenin concentration as well as chlorogenic and isochlorogenic acids.

AB Three acid- and alkaline-catalysed transesterification methods were compared with the aim to validate a simple yet reliable protocol for fatty acid (FA) profiling of milk fat. While both the acid- and alkaline-catalysed methods were able to convert completely triglycerides and phospholipids into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), the acid catalyst caused significant degradation of conjugated linoleic acid C18:2c9t11 at high temperature. Although a milder temperature can mitigate this negative impact, a long reaction time (2 h) is required to achieve full methylation. By contrast, despite being unable to methylate free fatty acids (FFA), the alkaline-catalysed transesterification yielded comparable results for all major FA due to the very low level of FFA in milk. The alkaline-catalysed methylation is benign for C18:2c9t11. We recommend here a simple one-step protocol based on 0.2 M methanolic KOH, a short reaction time (20 min) and a mild reaction temperature (50 degrees C) for milk FAME preparation.

AB Food by-products containing bioactive substances have attracted attention due to the possibility of adding values to residues of the food industry. In this work, the extraction of phenolic compounds from pinhao seed coats (Araucaria angustifolia (Bertol.) Kuntze) using a central composite rotatable design was applied to obtain prediction models for the extract volume yield, total phenolic content, total phenolic acids and total flavonoids. Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis were implemented showing an evident poor effect of the temperature on phenolic compounds extraction, which is in accordance with the prediction model obtained by the experimental design for total phenolic acids. Volume yield presented a high positive correlation with extraction temperature, followed by solvent composition. Scanning electron microscopy showed that higher temperatures and lower ethanol percentages resulted in highly defibrillated pinhao coats that retained more extract after the extraction process, leading to lower volume yield percentages.

AB Curcumin (E100) is a natural colorant that, besides conferring color, has bioactivity, serving as an alternative to some artificial colorants. As a hydrophobic colorant, its modification/compatibilization with the aqueous medium is required to improve stability and enable its application in hydrophilic food matrices. Herein, different formulations of curcumin (curcumin powder: PC, water-dispersible curcumin: DC: and nanoencapsulated curcumin: NC) were evaluated as yogurt colorants. PC showed the strongest bioactivity in all assays (EC50 values: 63 +/- 2 to 7.9 +/- 0.1 mu g.mL(-1); GI(50) values: 48 +/- 1 to 17 +/- 1 mu g.mL-1 and MIC values: 0.0625 to 0.5 mg.mL(-1)), which might indicate that DC and NC reduce the short-term accessibility to curcumin. The tested curcumin formulations produced yogurts with different appearance, specifically associated with their color parameters, besides presenting slight changes in nutritional composition and free sugars and fatty acids profiles. The water compatible formulations (DC and NC) showed advantages over hydrophobic (PC) having a wider industrial utilization.

AB The development of fungal resistance to antifungal drugs has been worsening over the years and as a result research on new antifungal agents derived from plants has intensified. Eugenia uniflora L. (pitanga) has been studied for its various biological actions. In this study the chemical composition and antifungal effects of the E. uniflora essential oil (EULEO) were investigated against Candida albicans (CA), Candida krusei (CK) and Candida tropicalis (CT) standard strains. The essential oil obtained through hydro-distillation was analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). To determine the IC50 of the oil, the cellular viability curve and the inhibitory effects were measured by means of the oil's association with Fluconazole in a broth microdilution assay with spectrophotometric readings. The Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) was determined by solid medium subculture with the aid of a guide plate while the assays used to verify morphological changes emerging from the action of the fractions were performed in microculture chambers at concentrations based on the microdilution. Two major oil constituents stand out from the chemical analysis: selina-1,3,7(11)-trien-8-one (36.37%) and selina-1,3,7(11)-trien-8-one epoxide (27.32%). The concentration that reduced microorganismal growth was >= 8,192 mu g/mL while the IC50 varied, this being between 1892.47 and 12491.80 mu g/mL (oil), 10.07 - 80.78 mu g/mL (fluconazole) and 18.53 - 295.60 mu g/mL (fluconazole + oil). The combined activity (fluconazole + oil) resulted in indifference and antagonism. A MFC of the oil in association with fluconazole was recorded at the concentration of 8,192 mu g/mL against CA and CK. The oil caused the inhibition of CA and CT morphological transition. In view of the results obtained, additional research is needed to elucidate the activity of the E. uniflora oil over genetic and biochemical processes regarding its effect on Candida spp. virulence.

AB The current water scarcity forces farmers to adopt new irrigation strategies to save water without jeopardizing the fruit yield and quality. In this study, the influence of 3 regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) treatments and 3 rootstocks on the functional quality of pistachios were studied. The functional parameters studied included, polyphenols, triterpenoids, and inhibition of alpha-amylase. The results showed that P. terebinthus and P. atlantica rootstocks led to pistachio kernels with higher contents of polyphenols and triterpenoids (mainly betulinic acid with 111 and 102 mu g g(-1), respectively) than pistachios obtained using P. integerrima rootstock (81 mu g g(-1)). On the other hand, the use of moderate RDI (T1 treatment) increased the total content of polyphenols (similar to 10%), quercetin-O-galloyl-hexoside (similar to 15%), keampferol-3-O-glucoside (similar to 19%), and polymeric procyanidins (similar to 20%), as compared to the control trees, resulting in pistachios with a better functional profile, lower economic cost and with a lesser environmental impact.

AB Catechins are the major bioactive compounds existing in tea leaves (Camellia sinensis). Dehydroascorbic acid is (DHAA) a reactive dicarbonyl species and previous studies have demonstrated that catechins could effectively trap DHAA to form ascorbyl adducts of catechins, especially epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Since catechins in the aqueous solution are unstable due to their structural features, ascorbic acid (AA) is usually added to bottled tea beverages to protect catechins. However, whether ascorbyl adducts of catechins are formed in bottled tea beverages remains unclear. In this study, formation of ascorbyl adducts of EGCG increased along with increased incubation time when EGCG and AA were dissolved in the aqueous solution. Next, 6C-DHAA-EGCG and 8C-DHAA-EGCG were detected in both green tea and oolong tea beverages, and their concentrations ranged from 0.23 to 1.95 mu M and 0.28 to 1.97 mu M, respectively. Furthermore, an 8C-ascorbyl adduct derived from gallocatechin gallate was also found in some tea beverages.

AB Resveratrol (R) was lipophilized by esterification in order to facilitate its application in a wide range of products and to possibly enhance its bioactivity. Twelve resveratrol derivatives were prepared using acyl chlorides of different chain length (C3:0-C22:6) and their antioxidant activities assessed. While resveratrol showed the highest antioxidant activity in oil-in-water emulsion, its derivatives (RC6:0, RC8:0, RC10:0, RC12:0, RC16:0) showed better antioxidant activity in a bulk oil system. Resveratrol esters RC20:5n-3 (REPA) and RC22:6n-3 (RDHA) showed the highest antioxidant activity when added to ground meat. Meanwhile, resveratrol derivatives (RC3:0-RC14:0) had better hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity than resveratrol. All test compounds except resveratrol and REPA inhibited copper-induced LDL oxidation. Moreover, test compounds effectively inhibited hydroxyl radical induced DNA scission. These results suggest that resveratrol derivatives could potentially serve as functional food ingredients and supplements for health promotion and disease risk reduction.

AB In present study, 198, 169, 213 and 128 proteins were identified and quantified in human, cow, goat and yak milk serum respectively by using proteomics techniques. Large variations were observed between human and ruminant milk proteins. Human milk contained higher concentration of mucosal immune response, complement proteins and regulators. The concentration of bactericidal proteins were relatively higher in ruminants milk. Human milk exclusively expressed proteins important for delivery or utilization of nutrients. Peptidase inhibitors prevent the bioactive proteins/peptides in human milk from gastral-intestinal digestion. Protein composition among ruminants milk was similar but with variations. Goat milk contained high level of complement proteins but low level of corresponding regulators. In addition, the acute phase proteins were significantly higher in goat milk. Of note, osteopontin in yak milk was enriched, which could offer an alternative source for producing osteopontin and revealed possible nutritional value of yak milk.

AB The effects of high humidity hot air impingement blanching (HHAIB) over a range of application times (30, 60, 90, and 120 s) on drying characteristics, hardness, cell wall pectin fractions contents and nanostructure, as well ultrastructure of apricot were investigated. Results showed that HHAIB reduced drying time and decreased the hardness of apricot by 20.7%-34.5% and 46.57%-71.89%, respectively. The water-soluble pectin (WSP) contents increased after blanching, while the contents of chelate-soluble pectin (CSP) and sodium-carbonate-soluble pectin (NSP) decreased significantly (P < 0.05). The hardness and drying time were found to correlate inversely with the WSP content, but positively with CSP and NSP contents. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) detection showed the decomposition and degradation of pectin fractions during blanching. Additionally, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation indicated that the cell wall structure was degraded and middle lamella integrity was destroyed by blanching.

AB A rapid methodology was developed to simultaneously predict water content and activity values (a(w)) of Moringa oleifera leaf powders (MOLP) using near infrared (NIR) signatures and experimental sorption isotherms. NIR spectra of MOLP samples (n=181) were recorded. A Partial Least Square Regression model (PLS2) was obtained with low standard errors of prediction (SEP of 1.8% and 0.07 for water content and a(w) respectively). Experimental sorption isotherms obtained at 20, 30 and 40 degrees C showed similar profiles. This result is particularly important to use MOLP in food industry. In fact, a temperature variation of the drying process will not affect their available water content (self-life). Nutrient contents based on protein and selected minerals (Ca, Fe, K) were also predicted from PLS1 models. Protein contents were well predicted (SEP of 2.3%). This methodology allowed for an improvement in MOLP safety, quality control and traceability.

AB A novel chitinase gene was cloned from Streptomyces albolongus ATCC 27414, and expressed successfully in Escherichia coli BL21. The recombinant enzyme (SaChiA4) belongs to glycoside hydrolases (GH) family 18 and consists of a catalytic domain and a chitin binding domain (CBD) in its C-terminus. SaChiA4 was purified homogeneously (specific activity of 66.2 U/mg with colloidal chitin as substrate), and showed a molecular mass of approximately 47 kDa. SaChiA4 showed its optimal activity at pH 5.0 and 55 degrees C and exhibited remarkable pH and temperature stability. SaChiA4 has been proved to have a higher specificity toward glycosides containing acetyl groups and hydrolyzes the substrates in a non-processive manner with higher ability to produce (GlcNAc)(2) and GlcNAc. The results indicated that SaChiA4 is a novel endo-type chitinase, which has potential applications in the treatment of chitin wastes and the production of (GlcNAc)(2).

In this study, the full-length sequences of Opvasa, Opdazl and Opnanosl were cloned and characterized from the dark sleeper (Odontobutis potamophila). Gonad-specific expression patterns of Opvasa and Opdazl were confirmed in adult tissues by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Different from Opvasa and Opdazl, the expression of Opnanosl was ubiquitously detected in all examined tissues except for the liver and spleen. Time-course dynamic expressions during embryogenesis were assessed, and all three genes (Opvasa, Opdazl and Opnanosl) persisted at a high level until gastrulation. qRT-PCR and Western blotting analyses revealed that all three genes were highly expressed throughout gametogenesis. In testis, the expressions of all three genes at the mRNA and protein levels were down-regulated during spermatogenesis. In ovary, different expression patterns were found, and all three genes had a differential role in translational regulation during oogenesis. The expressions of Opvasa, Opdazl and Opnanosl at the mRNA but not the protein level were high in stage IV. Different expression patterns were found in premeiotic gonads treated by HPG axis hormones (HCG and LHRH-A). Immunolocalization analysis demonstrated that in testis, Opvasa, Opdazl and Opnanosl were detected in spermatogonia and spermatocytes but absent in the meiotic products, such as spermatids and spermatozoa. In ovary, Opvasa, Opdazl and Opnanosl persisted at a high level throughout oogenesis. These findings indicated that Opvasa, Opdazl and Opnanosl played an important role in mitotic and early meiotic phases of oogenesis and spermatogenesis, and they functioned as maternal factors in early embryogenesis. Their proteins could be used as three new markers for germ cells during gametogenesis in O. potamophila gonad. Our data laid a good foundation for improving the breeding efficiency of O. potamophila.

AB Aims: The aim of this study was to explore the correlation of hTERT splice variant expression with MCPH1/ BRIT1 and BRCA1 expression in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) samples.
   Background: Telomerase activation can contribute to the progression of tumors and the development of cancer. However, the regulation of telomerase activity remains unclear. MCPH1 (also known as BRIT1, BRCT-repeat inhibitor of hTERT expression) and BRCA1 are tumor suppressor genes that have been linked to telomerase expression.
   Methods: qPCR was used to investigate telomerase splice variants, MCPH1/BRIT1 and BRCA1 expression in EOC tissue and primary cultures.
   Results: The wild type alpha+/beta+ hTERT variant was the most common splice variant in the EOC samples, followed by alpha+/beta- hTERT, a dominant negative regulator of telomerase activity. EOC samples expressing high total hTERT demonstrated significantly lower MCPH1/BRIT1 expression in both tissue (p = 0.05) and primary cultures (p = 0.03). We identified a negative correlation between MCPH1/BRIT1 and alpha+/beta+ hTERT (p = 0.04), and a strong positive association between MCPH1/BRIT1 and both alpha-/beta+ hTERT and alpha-/beta- hTERT (both p = 0.02). A positive association was observed between BRCA1 and alpha-/beta+ hTERT and alpha-/beta- hTERT expression (p = 0.003 and p = 0.04, respectively).
   Conclusions: These findings support a regulatory effect of MCPH1/BRIT1 and BRCA1 on telomerase activity, particularly the negative association between MCPH1/BRIT1 and the functional form of hTERT (alpha+/beta+).

AB Graves' disease is a multifactorial autoimmune disorder of the thyroid gland, with some extra-thyroidal complications like eye and skin abnormalities in some patients. GD is more prevalent in women than men and is the leading cause of hyperthyroidism worldwide. A complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors is the proposed cause which triggers immune system to produce autoantibodies stimulating the TSH receptor, leading to clinical manifestations such as hyperthyroidism, diffuse thyroid enlargement (goiter) and often ophthalmopathy in affected individuals. Various Single nucleotide gene polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with the risk of GD development including promoter SNPs in Forkhead Box P3 (FOXP3). FOXP3 is an important regulatory factor for T cell development and differentiation and therefore has a prominent role in suppression of autoimmune reactions which may lead to predisposition of GD. There have been some studies on the association of FOXP3 SNPs with GD, but no such investigation has been carried out in ethnic Kashmiri population. So, we aimed to study a possible association of FOXP3 promoter SNPs (-3279C/A, -2383C/T & -3499 A/G) with GD. Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used to genotype 285 individuals (135 GD cases and 150 healthy controls) and the results showed statistically significant differences in genotypic and allelic frequencies of cases and controls for -3279C/A SNP [OR, 3.48; 95% CI (2.05-5.92); P < 0.001] and -2383C/T SNP [OR, 5.62; 95% CI (2.43-13.00); P < 0.001], while no significant association was seen in case of 3499 A/G SNP. We conclude that -3279C/A and -2383C/T SNPs have a highly significant association with the risk of GD development in Kashmiri population.

AB Signal peptide-CUB-EGF domain-containing protein 2 (SCUBE2) belongs to a secreted and membrane-associated multi-domain SCUBE protein family. Recently, it was found to play an important role in tumor development. However, the role of SCUBE2 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has never been revealed. Here, we explored the roles and mechanism of SCUBE2 in the progression of NSCLC. Our result showed that SCUBE2 was expressed in low levels in NSCLC cell lines. In addition, overexpression of SCUBE2 significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. Further mechanistic analysis showed that SCUBE2 overexpression efficiently inhibited the protein expression of Shh, Smo, and Glil in NSCLC cells. Moreover, experiments with recombinant sonic hedgehog protein rh-Shh dramatically dampened the decrease in cell proliferation, invasion, and migration triggered by SCUBE2. Taken together, these results suggest that overexpression of SCUBE2 inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation and invasion through suppressing the Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway. Thus, SCUBE2 may be a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC.

AB The success of the pathogenic bacteria is partly attributable to their ability to thwart host innate immune responses, which includes resisting the antimicrobial functions of macrophages. And reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of the most effective antimicrobial components of macrophages to kill invading bacteria. Our previous studies found that Aeromonas hydrophila can survive in fish macrophages, which suggested that this bacterium might take fish macrophages as their shelters to resist drug killings and other immune damage. But how A. hydrophila survive in host macrophages remains unknown. Since KatG has been reported to have not only catalase activity but also peroxidase and peroxynitritase activity, the amino acid sequence and protein structure of KatG was analyzed in this study, the function of KatG in A. hydrophila survival in and escape from host macrophages was also carried out. The bioinformatics analysis displayed that KatG of A. hydrophila B11 showed > 93% homologous to that of KatG in other Aeromonas. KatG of A. hydrophila was stable silenced by shRNA and RT-qPCR confirmed the expression of KatG in KatG-RNAi was significantly reduced. The survival rate of intracellular KatG-RNAi decreased by 80% compared to that of the wild type strain 811, while the intracellular ROS level of the macrophages that phagocytosed KatG-RNAi increased 65.9% when compared to that of the macrophages phagocytosed wild-type strain. The immune escape rate of A. hydrophila decreased by 85% when the expression of KatG was inhibited. These results indicated that (1) The amino acid sequence and protein structure of KatG of A. hydrophila is conserved; (2) KatG helped A. hydrophila to survive in fish macrophages by eliminating the harm of intracellular H2O2 and inhibiting intracellular ROS levels increased; (3) A small portion of intracellular A. hydrophila could escape from host macrophages for further infection, in this process KatG also played important role.

AB Pertussis can be fatal for infants. The best way to prevent infant pertussis is to promote adult immunization. However, Tdap has not been licensed in Japan, so we investigated the effect and safety of the DTaP-IPV vaccine instead. The study examined 154 pediatric healthcare workers. Participants without effective levels of antibodies against pertussis toxin were given DTaP-IPV, reduced to 0.2 mL. In total, 48 of the 154 participants (31.2%) were seronegative for pertussis toxin. After vaccination of the seronegative participants, 40 of the 41 measured (97.5%) had acquired an effective response, and all 35 of those tested maintained a protective antibody level ten months after vaccination. Redness was observed in 14 of the 41 (34.1%) and soreness in 19 (46.3%). This study demonstrated that vaccination with reduced 0.2 mL DTaP-IPV successfully provided effective immunity. At least ten months after vaccination, all subjects maintained an adequate level of antibodies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Older adults are disproportionately affected by influenza morbidity and mortality. In most high income countries, influenza vaccine policies target persons age >= 65 years for influenza vaccination. Many low resource settings do not utilize seasonal influenza vaccination. Barriers to influenza prevention among older adults around the globe are multiple and some vary between high- and low-resource settings. To maximize influenza prevention in the older adult population, gaps in influenza vaccination coverage and improvements in vaccine efficacy are needed. The focus of this article is on the data for currently available vaccine strategies to maximize influenza vaccine impact, with a focus on high-resource settings. We also discuss novel influenza vaccine strategies needed for older adults worldwide. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Adverse events following immunization (AEFI) arising from anxiety have rarely been reported as a cluster(s) in the setting of a mass vaccination program. Reports of clusters of anxiety related AEFIs are understudied. Social media and the web may be a resource for public health investigators.
   Methods: We searched Google and Facebook separately from Atlanta and Geneva to identify reports of cluster anxiety-related AEFIs. We reviewed a sample of reports summarizing year, country/setting, vaccine involved, patient symptoms, clinical management, and impact to vaccination programs.
   Results: We found 39 reports referring to 18 unique cluster events. Some reports were only found based on the geographic location from where the search was performed. The most common vaccine implicated in reports was human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (48.7%). The majority of reports (97.4%) involved children and vaccination programs in school settings or as part of national vaccination campaigns. Five vaccination programs were reportedly halted because of these cluster events. In this study, we identified 18 cluster events that were not published in traditional scientific peer-reviewed literature.
   Conclusions: Social media and online search engines are useful resources for identifying reports of cluster anxiety-related AEFIs and the geographic location of the researcher is an important factor to consider when conducting these studies. Solely relying upon traditional peer-reviewed journals may seriously underestimate the occurrence of such cluster events. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Despite numerous public health campaigns to promote the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, uptake among adolescents in the US has remained below the Healthy People 80% goal for 3 dose completion. The Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH) used an innovative social media strategy to raise awareness and increase rates of HPV immunization initiation and series completion among adolescents.
   Methods: Between June 2012 and July 2013, PDPH launched a Facebook campaign to target Philadelphia adolescents (13-18 years) with specific messages about HPV immunization benefits and announce opportunities for vaccination. Six distinct advertising campaigns ran for two-week intervals. Facebook metrics and vaccine clinic data were used to track success. Reminder-recall letters were also sent to adolescents as part of the campaign.
   Results: On average, each advertising campaign reached 155,110 adolescents and engaged 2106 adolescents. The advertising campaigns that focused on HPV disease risk and local resources were the most successful in engaging adolescents. During advertising campaigns, there were sizeable increases in both reach and engagement compared to non-campaign periods. Overall, 3400 adolescents became fans of the campaign and 176 doses of HPV vaccine were administered to 152 adolescents. Only 2 adolescents were vaccinated as a result of the Facebook campaign while the rest were prompted by reminder recall letters or through community events.
   Conclusion: The campaign was well-received, far-reaching and generated awareness and conversations among adolescents. However, the campaign did not appear to be a sufficient driver for HPV uptake even when common barriers to HPV immunization were minimized. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To describe the cluster of MenC ST11 Invasive Meningococcal Disease (IMD) occurred in Tuscany in the years 2015-2016.
   Methods: A retrospective charts analysis of clinical, epidemiological and microbiological aspects of documented IMD was performed. Prognostic factors for death were evaluated.
   Results: Sixty-one patients with IMD in the 2015-2016 period were documented: 28 had meningococcemia, 24 meningitis plus meningococcemia and 9 meningitis. MenC ST11 (cc11) was identified in 48/54 (89%) of the tested strains. All patients, with the exception of three very early death, received timely and appropriate antibiotic therapy and, in selected case, adjunctive therapy with steroids and Pentaglobin (R). Forty-one patients recovered (67.3%, mean age: 26 years), 7 had permanent sequelae (11.3%, mean age 31 years) and 13 died (21.3%; mean age: 46 years). In a multivariate analysis, septic shock, purpura fulminans and advanced age were negative prognostic factors, while emergency admittance to a tertiary-care, university hospital, positively influenced the survival rate. The epidemiological analysis of the cluster identified close contacts and recreational environments such as discos as hotspot for MenC transmission. After a massive vaccination campaign, the number of MenC cases reported in Tuscany in 2017 decreased to 10, with no death.
   Conclusions: Vaccination campaign of key populations together with the need for rapid and qualified emergency care of the affected patients seems to be the main lesson learned by the MenC ST11 Tuscany epidemic. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biodefense vaccine are destined to be stockpiled for periods of time and deployed in the event of a public health emergency. In this report, we compared the potency of liquid and lyophilized (thermostabilized) formulations of a candidate ricin toxin subunit vaccine, RiVax, adsorbed to aluminum salts adjuvant, over a 12-month period. The liquid and lyophilized formulations were stored at stressed (40 degrees C) and unstressed (4 degrees C) conditions and evaluated at 3, 6 and 12-month time points for potency in a mouse model of lethal dose ricin challenge. At the same time points, the vaccine formulations were interrogated in vitro by competition ELISA for conformational integrity using a panel of three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), PB10, WECB2, and SyH7, directed against known immunodominant toxin-neutralizing epitopes on RiVax. We found that the liquid vaccine under stress conditions declined precipitously within the first three months, as evidenced by a reduction in in vivo potency and concomitant loss of mAb recognition in vitro. In contrast, the lyophilized RiVax vaccine retained in vivo potency and conformational integrity for up to one year at 4 degrees C and 40 degrees C. We discuss the utility of monitoring the integrity of one or more toxin neutralizing epitopes on RiVax as a possible supplement to animal studies to assess vaccine potency. ID (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Routine childhood immunization using two doses of the varicella vaccine was introduced in Japan in October 2014. In this study, we analyzed the data extracted from national varicella surveillance, including pediatric sentinel surveillance from 2000 to 2017 and hospitalized varicella surveillance from the 38th week of 2014 to the 37th week of 2017. Compared with the 2000-2011 baseline data, the number of varicella cases per sentinel decreased substantially by 76.6% overall and by 88.2% among children aged 1-4 years in 2017. Of 997 hospitalized patients, we found a decreasing trend in the number of cases among children aged <5 years. We also found a decreasing trend in the number of cases with complications among children aged 1-4 years. Data on the self-reported transmission sites in 35.5% (354/997) of the hospitalized varicella patients showed that transmission of varicella zoster virus (VZV) occurred frequently in household, at school for young children, in the workplace for adults, and at hospital for all age groups. Data from 29.0% (289/997) of the hospitalized patients with a self-reported source of infection showed that transmission of VZV occurred from a patient with herpes zoster (HZ) in 30.4% (88/289) of cases. Our data demonstrate a substantial decrease in the number of varicella cases in young children following introduction of routine childhood vaccination program with two-dose varicella vaccination in Japan. These data highlight the unique aspects of transmission sites across age groups and the important role of HZ cases in disease circulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: As congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is one of the major causes of birth defects and developmental abnormalities, it is essential to develop vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against CMV. Clinical trials demonstrated that the subunit vaccine based on glycoprotein B, which had been believed to be the major target for neutralization, did not induce sufficient protective immunity. On the other hand, it has been reported that the immunization of animals with the Pentamer, the pentameric complex of gH/gL/UL128/UL130/UL131A, induced strong neutralizing antibodies. Here, we sought to clarify whether any polymorphic alterations present in the Pentamer of clinical isolates affect neutralization by anti-Pentamer antibodies.
   Methods: Sequences of the genes encoding the Pentamer components of 25 Japanese clinical isolates were determined. Neutralization of infection by two seropositive sera and by anti-Pentamer serum was measured using a CMV reporter cell line based on ARPE-19.
   Results: Polymorphisms of the amino acid sequence of UL128, UL130, and UL131A ORFs were limited and clustered into two major groups. The identified alterations, except UL128 I140T, were mapped outside of the reported regions recognized by neutralizing antibodies. Anti-Pentamer serum neutralized infection with all isolates to a similar degree and had no correlation with the polymorphic groups.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that Pentamer antigens prepared from Merlin Fix strain induce antibodies that neutralize infection with all isolates to a similar level and that anti-Pentamer antibodies neutralize CMV infection better than do human sera, suggesting that vaccines and therapeutic antibodies based on Pentamer as an antigen have some promise.

AB We previously demonstrated that intramuscular immunization with virus-like particles (VLPs) composed of the haemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix (M1) proteins of AimeerkatiShanghai/SH1/2012 (Glade 2.3.2.1) protected mice from lethal challenge with viruses from other H5 HPAI clades. The inclusion of additional proteins that can serve as immunological adjuvants in VLPs may enhance adaptive immune responses following vaccination, and oral vaccines may represent the safest choice. Here, we report the generation of H5N1 VLPs composed of the viral HA, NA, and M1 proteins and membrane-anchored forms of the Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit protein (LTB) or the Toll-like receptor 5 ligand flagellin (Flic). Mice intramuscularly or orally immunized with VLPs containing LTB or Flic generated greater humoural and cellular immune responses than those administered H5N1 VLPs without LTB or Flic. Intramuscular immunization with VLPs protected mice from lethal challenge with homologous or heterologous H5N1 viruses irrespective of whether the VLPs additionally included LTB or Flic. In contrast, oral immunization of mice with LTB- or Flic-VLPs conferred substantial protection against lethal challenge with both homologous and heterologous H5N1 influenza viruses, whereas mice immunized orally with VLPs lacking LTB and Flic universally succumbed to infection. Mice immunized orally with LTB- or Flic-VLPs showed 10-fold higher virus-specific IgG titres than mice immunized with H5N1-VLPs lacking LTB or Flic. Collectively, these results indicate that the inclusion of immunostimulatory proteins, such as LTB and Flic, in VLP-based vaccines may represent a promising new approach for the control of current H5N1 HPAI outbreaks by eliciting higher humoural and cellular immune responses and conferring improved cross-Glade protection.

TI Use of the Community Assessment for Public Health Response (CASPER)
   method to assess influenza vaccination and activity in Brazos County,
   Texas
SO VACCINE

AB Objectives: Based on an increase in influenza cases in Brazos County, Texas, a Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPER) was conducted by the Brazos County Health Department (BCHD) and the Texas A&M School of Public Health's EpiAssist program. The goal of the CASPER was to supplement other data sources to assess vaccination rates and influenza prevalence in the community during a period of high influenza activity nationwide.
   Methods: Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) CASPER toolkit, 30 census blocks in Brazos County were selected probability proportionate to population size. Seven interviews were attempted in each selected census block by an interview team. The survey contained 21 questions in 5 domains, including demographics, general infection control knowledge, prior infection with influenza, prior experience with influenza vaccine, and attitudes towards influenza vaccination. Survey results were entered into a database for the calculation of frequencies, crude odds ratios (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
   Results: Two-hundred and seven households completed the survey. Estimated vaccination rates in Brazos County adults were higher than Texas adults overall, but rates did not differ among children. Forty-two (20.4%) of respondents reported having influenza illness during the month of December 2017. Overall, respondents were knowledgeable of influenza transmission and prevention and reported few barriers and objections to the vaccine; however, some responses suggest misinformation that could be addressed through communication from local health departments exists. African American/Black respondents were less likely to receive a vaccine than respondents of other races, while individuals age 65 and over as well as those who believed the vaccine to be effective were more likely to be vaccinated.
   Conclusion: GASPER should be considered a tool for assessing influenza vaccine and disease status of communities and has potential for providing information useful in the development of public health initiatives. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Two types of vaccines are currently licensed for use against pertussis: whole-cell (wP) and acellular pertussis (aP). There is evidence that wP confers more durable immunity than aP, however wP has been more frequently associated with adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). A comparison of the frequency of AEFI with the first doses of wP and aP has not yet been clearly documented. This must be done in light of recent considerations to move towards a wP prime-aP boost vaccination strategy in low and middle-income countries.
   Objectives: To compare the frequency of AEFI associated with the first dose of the wP and aP vaccines. We also compared the frequency of AEFI associated with subsequent doses of wP.
   Methods: This systematic review was carried out in strict accordance with the published protocol.
   Results: High heterogeneity amongst included one-armed studies did not allow for pooling of prevalence estimates. The prevalence estimates of AEFI at first vaccine dose of wP ranged from 0 to 75%, while the prevalence estimates of AEFI at first vaccine dose of aP ranges from 0 to 39%. The prevalence estimates of adverse events following second and third vaccine dose of wP ranged from 0 to 71% and 0 to 61%, respectively.
   Risk ratios among two-armed studies showed an increased risk of adverse events with first dose of wP compared to aP [local reaction RR 2.73 (2.33, 3.21), injection site pain RR 4.15 (3.24, 5.31), injection site swelling RR 4.38 (2.70, 7.12), fever over 38 degrees C RR 9.21 (539, 15.76), drowsiness RR 1.34 (1.18, 1.52) and vomiting RR 1.28 (0.91, 1.79)].
   Conclusion: Our results confirm that, when comparing the first dose, wP is more reacotgenic than aP. The proposed wP prime followed by aP boost pertussis vaccine strategy should be approached with caution. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Clostridium difficile flagellin FliC is a highly immunogenic pathogen-associated molecular pattern playing a key role in C. difficile pathogenesis and gut colonization. Here, we designed an oral vaccine against C difficile with FliC encapsulated into pectin beads for colonic release. Bead stability and FliC retention was confirmed in vitro using simulated intestinal media (SIM), while bead degradation and FliC release was observed upon incubation in simulated colonic media (SCM). The importance of FliC encapsulation into pectin beads for protection against C difficile was assessed in a vaccination assay using a lethal hamster model of C. difficile infection. Three groups of hamsters orally received either FliC-loaded beads or unloaded beads in gastro-resistant capsule to limit gastric degradation or free FliC. Two other groups were immunized with free FliC, one intra-rectally and the other intra-peritoneally. Hamsters were then challenged with a lethal dose of C difficile VPI 10463. Fifty percent of hamsters orally immunized with FliC-loaded beads survived whereas all hamsters orally immunized with free FliC died within 7 days post challenge. No significant protection was observed in the other groups. Only intra-peritoneally immunized hamsters presented anti-FliC IgG antibodies in sera after immunizations. These results suggest that an oral immunization with FliC-loaded beads probably induced a mucosal immune response, therefore providing a protective effect. This study confirms the importance of FliC encapsulation into pectin beads for a protective oral vaccine against C. difficile. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: Although the World Health Organization recommends universal rotavirus immunization, uptake of the vaccine is low in Poland and Hungary, where it is not covered by the National Immunization Program. This study aimed to quantify mothers' preferences for vaccines preventing children's diarrheal illness and to examine whether willingness to vaccinate varies with working status.
   Methods: Mothers of children aged <3 years living in Poland and Hungary completed an online discrete choice experiment survey. In each of 9 choice questions, respondents indicated whether they preferred no vaccination or one of two hypothetical vaccine profiles described in terms of 6 features. Vaccine preference parameters were estimated for working and non-working mothers using a random-parameter logit model and were used to calculate the relative importance of changes in vaccine features.
   Results: 350 mothers in Poland and 350 mothers in Hungary were surveyed. Of the attributes evaluated, changes in vaccine cost were most important in both countries, followed by changes in severity of illness prevented, vaccine effectiveness, mode of administration, duration of illness prevented, and number of doses. Mothers in both countries had a strong preference for vaccination versus no vaccination, which was more pronounced among working mothers. In Poland, working mothers placed less weight on effectiveness, illness severity, and cost than non-working mothers and were more likely to rate disruptions in work, child care, and routines as important reasons to vaccinate. In Hungary, working mothers were statistically significantly less likely to opt out of vaccination than non-working mothers. Preference for vaccination itself, relative to improving vaccine effectiveness (from 50% to 90% effective), was 7 times greater among working than among non-working mothers in Poland but was not considerably different between working and non-working mothers in Hungary.
   Conclusions: Polish and Hungarian working mothers are more likely to vaccinate children against diarrheal illness than non-working mothers. (C) 2018 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under the CC BY license.

AB Background: Trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs) offer substantial protection against matching B-strains, however, protection against alternate-lineage B-strains may be enhanced by adding a second B-strain in quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIVs). In this Phase III, double-blind, multicentre, randomised study, the immunogenicity and safety of subunit inactivated QIV versus TIV was assessed in adult (aged >= 18 to <= 60 years) and elderly (aged >= 61 years) subjects by analysing a combination of haemagglutinin inhibition (HI) and virus neutralisation (VN).
   Methods: Subjects (n = 1980) were recruited off season (2015/2016) from 20 centres in five European countries and randomised to receive either QIV (n = 1538), TIV with B-strain of the Victoria lineage (n = 221) or TIV with B-strain of the Yamagata lineage (n = 221). The primary aim was to demonstrate non-inferiority of QIV to TIV for immunogenicity against matched influenza strains based on post vaccination HI titres. Secondary aims were to show superiority of QIV to TIV for immunogenicity against alternate-lineage B-strains and to characterise the immune response by reverse cumulative distribution (RCD) curves of antibody titres and derived serological parameters for HI and VN. Reactogenicity and occurrence of adverse events were assessed post-vaccination.
   Results: QIV elicited a non-inferior immune response for matched strains (upper limit of 95% CI for HI geometric mean ratios [GMRs] <1.5) and a superior response for alternate-lineage B-strains (HI GMRs < 1; p < 0.0001) versus TIV. RCD curves demonstrated that post-vaccination HI and VN titres were higher for QIV versus TIV for both alternate-lineage B-strains. Seroconversion rates and geometric mean fold increases of the VN assay were consistent with the HI assay for all strains in QIV. Reporting rates of local and systemic reactions were similar in both vaccine groups.
   Conclusions: QIV was non-inferior in immunogenicity to TIV for matched strains and superior to the alternate-lineage B-strains in TIV. Safety and tolerability profiles of QIV and TIV were comparable. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.

AB In graminaceous plants, nicotianamine (NA) is an important component of metal acquisition. NA is synthesized from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) catalyzed by nicotianamine synthase (NAS). Here, eight Triticum monococcum NAS (TmNAS) genes were cloned and characterized. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that TtnNAS genes had high sequence identity with those from Triticum aestivum, Zea mays, Oryza sativa and Hordewn vulgare. Phylogenetic analysis showed that NAS genes were classified into two distinct groups, e.g. group I and group II. Expression analysis demonstrated that two of the TmNAS genes in group II were highly expressed in shoot tissues, and the other six TmNAS genes in group I were expressed in root tissues. Further analysis indicated that root-specific TmNAS genes were up-regulated under conditions of Fe- or Zn-deficiency growth, while shoot specific TtnNAS genes were up-regulated under conditions of Fe- or Zn-sufficiency. These results help us understand the NAS genes in T. monococcum and provide novel genetic resources for improving Fe and Zn concentrations in common wheat.

AB Paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor (PILR)beta regulates inflammatory responses to pathogen infection, and therefore plays an important role in host disease resistance/susceptibility. However porcine PILR beta remains poorly characterized. In this study, we obtained the cDNA (V1) of its encoding gene, PILRB, and three alternative splicing (AS) variants (V2-4). The complete coding sequence of V1 was 621 bp long encoding a polypeptide of 206 aa. Compared with V1, V2 and V3 were formed by exon-skipping in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR), while V4 was formed by alternative 3' splice site of exon 3, resulting in a premature termination codon, combined with exon skipping in the 3'-UTR. Expression profile analysis showed that all the isoforms were most abundant in the spleen, and V1 was strongly induced by poly(I:C). Furthermore, the transcription of V1 altered with the increasing age and differed between species. Exon skipping in the 3'-UTR of V2 and V3 down-regulated expression of the luciferase reporter gene, and hence presumably of the PILRB gene, while V4 was subjected to nonsense mediated mRNA decay. Additionally, five novel splicing patterns were detected using the minigene approach, indicating complex AS of porcine PILRB. These results will help to reveal the role of PILRj3 in the host immune response using pig models, and will facilitate the breeding of pigs resistant to viral diseases through molecular breeding methods.

AB Coronary artery disease (CAD) exhibits the rules of the multifactorial hereditary. Notwithstanding, the role of genetic factors in the prevalence of CAD is estimated very high. SIRTI plays an athero-protective role and alterations in its expression have some important consequence in the metabolism, cholesterol, and fat deposition. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between rs4746720, rs12413112, and rs1467568 polymorphisms in the SIRTI gene and CAD in the high-risk cases. In the present retrospective case-control study, 150 healthy individuals and 150 cases diagnosed with atherosclerotic lesions were investigated. ARMS PCR was used to determine the genotypes of rs4746720 polymorphism, while tetra primer-ARMS PCR was used for genotyping of rs12413112 and rs1467568 polymorphisms. Considering rs12413112 polymorphism, the frequency of the AG heterozygote genotype was significantly lower in cases than controls (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the frequency of the A-positive (AA + AG vs. GG) genotype was significantly different between groups (P < 0.001). The frequency of the variant A allele was 0.36% in cases and 0.46% in controls (P = 0.01). Except for a borderline protective effect in the present of rs1467568AG genotype, the allele and genotype distributions of both rs1467568 and rs4746720 polymorphisms did not differ between two groups. The haplotype constructed from rs1467568A, rs12413112A, and rs4746720T alleles showed a significant protective effect on the risk of CAD (OR: 0.53; 95%CI: 0.35-0.78; P = 0.001). In conclusion, the SIRT1 gene may contribute to the pathogenesis of CAD, while further investigations were suggested to confirm our results.

AB Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) usually presents in childhood with fever, nonmalignant splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy along with hemocytopenia. This case report describes a 10-year-old boy presenting with signs of autoimmune disease, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and resistant hemocytopenia. Sirolimus controlled the relapsed thrombocytopenia after splenectomy. Sequencing of the FAS gene identified two spontaneous heterozygous mutations (c.234 T > G, p.D78E) (c.236dupA, p.P80Tfs*26). The boy's homozygous missense variation (c.2588G > A, p.G863D) (rs140184929) in UNC13D gene had been identified as being related to familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL). TCR alpha beta + CD4/CD8 double-negative T cells (markers of ALPS) were not significantly increased from the outset. Elevated cytokines, such as interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha decreased to normal levels after splenectomy whereas IL-10 remained high. Immunological analysis of the patient revealed a marked depletion of forkhead-box P3(+) expressing regulatory T cells (Treg) and Th17 cells. The obtained data demonstrate that mutations to FAS and UNC13D which result in overwhelming T-cell and macrophage activation, one associated with inhibited Treg cell development and a severe ALPS-like symptom. Therefore, we propose that variations of UND13D may be a risk factor of ALPS development.

AB Kruppel-like factor 3 (KLF3), a member of the Kruppel-like factor (KLF) family, plays an important role in adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate whether KLF3 could be used as a candidate gene in the breeding of cattle. The expression pattern of bovine KLF3 gene revealed that it was highly expressed in abdominal fat and perirenal fat. Using DNA sequencing, three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the promoter regions of KLF3 gene were identified in 448 Qinchuan cattle, which are located in the recognition sequences of 11 transcription factors and the four haplotypes representing four potential different compositions of polymorphic potential cis-acting elements. Association analysis results indicated that individuals with the Hap7/7 diplotype showed higher (P < 0.05) intramuscular fat content (IFC) than those with H7/8. In addition, the H7 haplotype had much higher (P < 0.05) transcriptional activity than the H8 haplotype, consistent with the association analysis. We speculated that polymorphisms in transcription factor binding sites of the KLF3 promoter region affected transcriptional activity of KLF3, which subsequently influence intramuscular fat content in Qinchuan cattle and KLF3 gene could be used as molecular markers for fat deposition traits using early marker-assisted selection (MAS) of Qinchuan cattle breeding in the future.

AB Ecotropic virus integration site-1 (EVI1) is an oncogenic transcription factor which locus on chromosome 3(3q26.2). Alterations in EVIL functions correspond with poor prognosis in different cancers, underscoring their status for the clinical cancer phenotype. MicroRNAs(MiR)are a class of small non-coding RNA sequences. They post-transcriptionally influence mRNA sequence through imperfect pairing with the 3'-UTR. Moreover, a growing body of studies showed that miRNAs could regulate initiation and progression of human malignancies. Current studies have been described that identifies numerous microRNAs that can be modulated by EVIl. Interestingly, the expression level of EVIl can also be regulated by microRNAs, thus forming a reciprocal link. Recent understanding of the functional roles of EVI1, microRNAs, and their interactions in human cancers are summarized. This review will help to define a relationship between EVI1 and microRNAs in human malignancies and develop novel therapeutic strategies.

AB Objective: Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) gene can be involved in the development of congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD). This study was aimed at investigating mutations in the promoter region of the CFTR gene and its associated effects on CFTR transcription in Chinese patients with CBAVD.
   Methods: To identify CFTR promoter region mutations in Chinese CBAVD patients, fragments 1.4 kb upstream of the ATG start codon of the CFTR gene were sequenced in 66 Chinese patients with CBAVD and compared to the corresponding sequences from 60 healthy subjects and sequence data present in the NCBI database. The relationship between the mutations and gene regulation was explored using Transfac analysis and a phylogenetic footprint method. Plasmids were constructed by incorporating statistically significant variant sequences. The effects of the mutations on CFTR transcription were investigated using a dual luciferase reporter gene assay.
   Results: a total of six point mutations, which included c.-150G > T, c.-205T > C, c.-245C > T, c.-871G > T, c.-966 T > G and c.-1062G > C, and one deletion mutation, namely c.-861delT, were identified in the promoter region of the CFTR gene in Chinese CBAVD patients. Among them, c.-966 T > G had the highest frequency and presented in either a homozygous or heterozygous mutation state. The frequency of G/G genotype in the CBAVD group was 33/66 (50.00%), while the T/G and T/T genotypes had frequencies of 18/66 (27.27%) and 15/66 (22.73%), respectively. A significant difference was found between the CBAVD and control group (P < 0.01). The locus for this variant was found in a conserved sequence. The Transfac tool showed that transcription factors EHF and STAT3, which are closely associated with reproduction, can bind to the sequence containing the variant locus. Two types of plasmid vectors, one carrying the G/G variant and the other the wild type T/T sequences, were constructed and respectively transfected into human cervical cancer cells (HeLa), human renal epithelial cells (HEK-293), and human colon cancer cells (SW480). It was found that the homozygous c.-966 T > G mutation significantly reduced CFTR transcription efficiency by 18.75%-35.50%.
   Conclusion: Mutations in the promoter region of the CFTR gene in Chinese CBAVD patients are different from those found in comparable Caucasian patients. The homozygous c.-966 T > G mutation state had the highest frequency, which reduced the CFTR transcriptional level and showed significant tissue-specificity.

AB Famesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) is a vital enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Our previous study has indicated that overexpression of FPPS increases hypoxia/reoxygenation (HR) injury in Heart-derived H9c2 Cells. Hence, we designed this experiment to further investigate the effect of FPPS on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MIR) injury using a transgenic (Tg) model, and explore the relevant mechanisms. The results showed that when mouse hearts were subjected to ex vivo I/R, Tg mice have a higher CK and LDH, a larger myocardial infarct size and lower heart function recovery. These phenomena are associated with the increased Rac1 activity and ROS generation. These findings point to that FPPS might be a potential target in preventing MIR in vivo.

AB Injured skeletal muscle would go through a sequence of the pathological phases of degeneration, myogenesis and fibrosis. Growing evidence indicated that fibrotic and myogenic phases might overlap within the injured skeletal muscle in the early time after injury. However, the mechanism underlying this overlapping remains unclear. Here, we performed an IncRNA microarray to identify the activated pathways in mice muscle seven days after contusion. KEGG analysis indicated that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) signaling cascade was predicted to be activated by IncRNAs. The top genes targeted by lncRNAs in PI3K/Akt signaling were subunits of laminin, collagen 5, and collagen 6, which participated in either myogenic or fibrotic process. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis and immunohistochemical stain further confirmed the prediction in silico. These results suggested that the overlap might be related to an activated PI3K/Akt pathway by lncRNA regulation.

AB Background: The early intervention is a rational approach to reduce the cardiovascular disease mortality in cancer patients. Here, we tried to identify potential biomarkers for the endothelial damage caused by cisplatin, a typical chemotherapy compound, and explore its underlying mechanisms.
   Methods: Microarray dataset GSE62523 were utilized to assess the gene differential expression from human micro-vascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) treated with cisplatin. Then, the potential key genes were further validated by qRT-PCR and the gamma H2AX level was evaluated to monitor the DNA damages caused by cisplatin.
   Result: For the 'acute-exposure' settings that HMEC-1 were treated with 12.9 mu M cisplatin for 6, 24 and 48 h, ATF3, LRRTM2, VCAM1 and PAPPA were identified as potential key genes in endothelial damage, while for the `chronic-exposure' settings that cells were exposed to 0.52 mu M cisplatin twice a week, SULF2, ACTA2 and PRAP1 were identified. In addition, further in vitro validation showed that knockdown of ATF3 attenuated the gamma H2AX level in cells exposed to cisplatin for 6 or 24 h and knockdown of PRAP1 increased the gamma H2AX level in cells exposed to cisplatin for 2 days. Notably, ATF3 has the ability to regulate the expression of HIST1H1D, FBX06, APP, MDM2, STAT1 and TRAF1, while PRAP1 regulates YWHAB, MDM2, ISG15, LYN and CUL1 during cisplatin-induced DNA damage repair process.
   Conclusion: ATF3 and PRAP1 play important roles in cisplatin-induced DNA damage repair process. They may serve as potential early surrogate biomarkers of microvascular endothelial damage for cancer patients receiving chemotherapies.

AB A leukotoxin (LtxA) that is produced by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) is an important virulence determinant in an aggressive form of periodontitis in adolescents. Understanding the function of this protein at the molecular level is critical to elucidating its role in the disease process. To accomplish genetic analysis of the protein structure and relating these observations to toxin function, we have developed an E. coli expression system for the generation and rapid purification of LtxA. Cloning the structural toxin gene, ltxA, from Aa strain JP2 under control of T7 promoter-1 of pCDFDuet-1 vector resulted in expression of a 114 KDa protein which could be easily purified by the presence of a carboxy-terminal engineered double hexahistidine (double-His6) tag and was immunologically reactive with an anti-LtxA monoclonal antibody, but was not cytotoxic. Cloning a second gene, ltxC, an acyltransferase gene, into the vector under control of T7 promoter-2, resulted in expression of the biologically active LtxA. The toxin was extracted from E. coli inclusion bodies, purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography, and refolded by dialysis. When compared by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy analysis, acylated recombinant LtxA has a secondary structure consistent with wt LtxA, while variations in alpha-helical structure of nonacylated LtxA were observed. No modifications in alpha-helix were found upon the toxin's binding with liposome-incorporated cholesterol. Our results suggest that pure, biologically active recombinant LtxA can be isolated by a one-step affinity chromatography from E. cob. The toxic and structural properties of the recombinant LtxA are similar to its wt counterpart.

AB Background. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia affects 24.3 million people worldwide. More than twenty genetic loci have been associated with AD and a significant number of genetic variants were mapped within these loci. A large proportion of genome wide significant variants lie outside the coding region. However, the plausible function of these variants is still unexplored.
   Objective: The present study aimed to unravel the regulatory role of proxy single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to determine their risk of developing AD.
   Methods: The RegulomeDB was employed to predict the regulatory role of proxy SNPs. Protein association network and functional enrichment analysis was performed using String10.5 and gene ontology, respectively.
   Results: A total of 451 SNPs were examined through SNAP web portal (r(2) <= 0.80) which returned 2186 proxy SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with genome wide significant SNPs for AD. Out of 2186 SNPs analyzed in RegulomeDB, 151 had the scores < 3 that indicates the high degree of their potential regulatory function. Further analysis revealed that out of these 151 SNPs, 37 were genome wide significant for AD, 17 were significantly associated with diseases other than AD, 89 were proxy SNPs (not genome wide significant) for various diseases including AD while 8 SNPs were novel proxy SNPs for AD.
   Conclusion: These findings support the notion that the non-coding variants can be strongly associated with disease risk. Further validation through genome wide association studies will be helpful for the elucidation of their regulatory potential.\

AB Purpose: To explore the potential molecular mechanism of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) in the treatment of temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ-OA), and identify the target genes for therapy of TMJ-OA.
   Methods: Rat TMJ-OA was induced by unilateral occlusal trauma (UOT). At 8 weeks, the experimental group rats were treated by LIPUS for 4 weeks (5 days every week). The cartilage was examined by histological techniques. Gene expression profile in control, placebo and LIPUS-treated group were measured by RNA sequencing (RNASeq). Gene oncology (GO) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) annotated were performed and ten differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were further validated in another individual by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Per-2, a circadian rhythm gene, was further confirmed by western blot.
   Results: TMJ-OA model was successfully established in rats through UOT. LIPUS played a positive role in attenuating the retrogression of cartilage. The cartilage lesion was determined by HE and Safranin-O staining. A significant and bran-new gene profile of 58 mRNAs was obtained from the RNA-Seq (LIPUS-treated/placebo) and generated approximately 30GB data. Annotation, functional classification and pathway of the data were analyzed based on GO and KEGG database and ten candidate DEGs were identified. Some of these genes were proved to be related to OA, such as matrix-degrading enzyme (ADAMTS-8), complement (Clqa, C3, C5aR1). Some were reported for the first time in TMJ-OA, such as circadian gene (Per-2, Dbp, Npas2 and Arntl). According to the results of qRT-PCR validation, the sequencing data was with a high degree of credibility. The circadian gene Per 2 was up-regulated by LIPUS in TMJ-OA on the mRNA and protein level.
   Conclusion: This study reveals the potential therapeutic genes related to TMJ-OA. Especially the circadian Per-2 gene was detected up-regulated by the treatment of LIPUS. It provides us a precious, new target OA-related gene and further investigation of gene-function will provide us new insights in understanding the potential mechanical underling TMJ-OA.

AB Gestational diabetes (GDM) is defined as glucose intolerance that presents during pregnancy. It increases the risk of developing diabetes later in life. Recent studies indicate the important role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of diabetes, including GDM. However, information on the plasma miRNA profile in GDM patients at the late second trimester, at which time the glucose metabolism disorder manifests, is scarce. This study aimed to determine the plasma miRNA expression profiles of the pregnant women with GDM and compare them to those of pregnant controls using the real-time PCR array method. The study involved 22 single-pregnancy women (mean age standard deviation of 29.9 +/- 4.5 years old) who underwent a glucose tolerance test between 23 and 31 weeks of gestation. Of them, 13 were diagnosed with GDM. We identified 15 upregulated miRNAs in the GDM patients that were involved in 41 pathways. Among the top 10 associated pathways, fatty acid biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism were targeted by the most, of the miRNAs investigated, with very low p values (p < 1e-325, false discovery rate corrected). MiR-195-5p, which targeted the highest number of genes important in metabolism, showed the highest fold upregulation. We conclude that increased miRNA expression, especially miR-195-5p, in plasma is characteristic of and causally related to the development of GDM.

AB Background: Apolipoprotein B (APOB), and hepatic lipase (LIPC) genes have been shown to play a key role in lipid metabolism in type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study aimed to investigate the association of the three polymorphisms (rs679899 in APOB and rs6078 and rs6083 in LIPC) with T2D and related clinical quantitative traits.
   Methods: We conducted a case-control study in Chinese Han population, with a total of 929 T2D patients and 1044 healthy subjects in Chinese Han population. Polymorphisms were genotyped by MassARRAY Genotyping System.
   Results: The risk allele G of the polymorphism rs679899 was related to T2D (odds ratio (OR): 1.207, 95% confidence interval (CL): 1.006-1.448, P = 0.043) and the polymorphism rs679899 was associated with glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels (P = 0.001). We also showed that the polymorphism rs6083 was associated with cholesterol (CHOL) levels (P = 0.012), triglyceride (TG) levels (P = 0.040), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels (P = 0.033). No significant difference in genotypic frequencies of rs6078 and rs6083 was observed between T2D patients and controls.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that the APOB polymorphism rs679899 is associated with type 2 diabetes and GGT levels, while the LIPC polymorphism rs6083 may influence CHOL, TG, and LDL levels in Chinese Han population.

AB Here we present a case report of collagen VI related myopathy in a patient, 8 y.o. boy, with intermediate phenotype between severe Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy and milder Bethlem myopathy. Whole exome sequencing revealed two novel single nucleotide variants in COL6A3 gene: paternal p.G1u2402Ter, resulting in premature translation termination codon and degradation of mRNA from this allele probably due to nonsense mediated decay, and maternal p.Arg1660Cys leading to amino-acid substitution in N2-terminal domain. COL6A3 expression analysis of proband's fibroblasts reveals functional homozygosity of the latter variant. Paternal fibroblasts showed only WT allele expression, which could lead to a reduction in mature transcript level, while maternal fibroblasts expressed both alleles. Functional assay of immunofluorescent staining of COL6A3 protein in fibroblasts culture reveals profound changes in COL6A3 localization and reduction of protein level in studied cultures when comparing with the controls. This study not only broadens the allelic spectrum of pathogenic COL6A3 variants in myopathy but also gives an additional support to Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy and Bethlem myopathy clinical continuum.

AB TMZ is the only drug that has improved survival of GBM patients although minimally. However, a number of GBM patients did not respond to TMZ-based chemotherapy. Here, we found that miR-505 inhibited tumorigenesis as a tumor suppressor in glioblastoma. In addition, TMZ could increase the levels of miR-505 and combination with pri-miR-505 and TMZ promoted the suppressive role mediated by miR-505 in GBM cells. Furthermore, miR-505 inactivated the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway by directly targeting and inhibiting WNT7B. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that the induction of miR-505 in combination with TMZ treatment could be a useful therapeutic strategy for suppressing GBM.

AB Background: Ischemic stroke (IS) is a complex and devastating vascular disease that has become one of the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide. Several studies have shown the association between matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family gene polymorphisms and IS. However, the results have been indecisive.
   Objective: To investigate the association between Matrix Metalloproteinase gene polymorphisms and risk of IS.
   Methods: A literature search for eligible candidate gene studies published before, 28 June 2017, was conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane and Google Scholar databases. The following combinations of main keywords were used: ('Matrix Metalloproteinase' or 'INAMP' or 'Stromelysin-1' or 'Gelatinase b') AND ('ischemic stroke' or 'IS') AND ('single nucleotide polymorphism' or 'gene polymorphism' or 'SNP'). Fixed or random effects models were used to estimate the Pooled Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical analysis was carried out by using STATA version 13.0 software.
   Results: Total 29 studies were included in our meta-analysis. A significant association was observed for MMP-9 (- 1562C/T) (OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.53; p value = 0.01) and MMP-12 (- 1082 A/G) (OR 2.55; 95% CI 1.75 to 3.71; p value < 0.001) gene polymorphisms and risk of IS. No significant association was found for any of the MMP-1(- 1607 1G/2G), MMP-2 (- 1306C/T) & (- 735C/T) and MMP-3 (- 1612 5A/6A) gene polymorphisms with the risk of IS.
   Conclusion: Our meta-analysis suggests that MMP-9 (- 1562C/T) and MMP-12 (- 1082 A/G) gene polymorphisms could be a risk factor for IS while MMP-1 (- 1607 1G/2G), MMP-2 (- 1306C/T) & (- 735C/T) and MMP-3 (-1612 5A/6A) have no association with the risk of causing IS. However, large prospective studies with sufficient power are required to validate our findings.

AB To elucidate the Cdk5 regulatory molecular mechanism in skin, we generated Cdk5-knockdown mice and subjected their skins to IncRNA sequencing. The results showed that there were 4533 novel IncRNAs from 142 IncRNA families. In total, 693 lncRNAs were significantly differentially expressed. Alignment analysis of the IncRNAs in miR Base identified 45 pre-mRNAs. By KEGG PATHWAY Database analysis, we found that IncRNAs (Inc-NONMMUT064276.2, Inc-NONMMUT075728.1, and Inc-NONMMUT039653.2) may regulate pigmentation by regulating target genes. To reveal potential antisense IncRNA-mRNA interactions, we searched all 1ncRNA-mRNA duplexes using RNAplex, and found 97 lncRNAs interacted with mRNAs. The luciferase assay confirmed that TCONS_00049140 binded to Krt80 by the co-transfection of pVAX1-TCONS_00049140 and pGL0-Krt80 expression plasmids in 293T cell, based on the bioinformatics analysis. Overexpression of TCONS_00049140 in mouse melanocytes down-regulated Krt80 and resulted in the phenotype of increased cell proliferation and increased melanin production. The results suggested that TCONS_00049140 contributed to skin thickening through Krt80. Our findings provide a direction for research of the molecular mechanism of Cdk5 function.

AB The amine transaminase from Vibrio fluvialis (Vf-ATA) is an attractive enzyme with applications within Biocatalysis for the preparation of chiral amines. Various catalytic properties of Vf-ATA have been investigated, but a biophysical characterization of its stability has been lacking. Today, the industrial application of Vf-ATA is limited by its low operational stability. In order to enhance the knowledge regarding the structural stability of ATAs, general characterizations of different ATAs are required. In this work, the stability of Vf-ATA was explored. First, the affinity between enzyme and pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) (KD value of 7.9 mu M) was determined. Addition of PLP to enzyme preparations significantly improved the enzyme thermal stability by preventing enzyme unfolding. With the aim to understand if this was due to the PLP phosphate group coordination into the phosphate group binding cup, the effect of phosphate buffer on the enzyme stability was compared to HEPES buffer. Low concentrations of phosphate buffer showed a positive effect on the enzyme initial activity, while higher phosphate buffer concentrations prevented cofactor dissociation. Additionally, the effects of various amine or ketone substrates on the enzyme stability were explored. All tested amines caused a concentration dependent enzyme inactivation, while the corresponding ketones showed no or stabilizing effects. The enzyme inactivation due to the presence of amine can be connected to the formation of PMP, which forms in the presence of amines in the absence of ketone. Since PMP is not covalently bound to the enzyme, it could readily leave the enzyme upon formation. Exploring the different stability effects of cofactor, substrates, additives and buffer system on ATAs seems to be important in order to understand and improve the general performance of ATAs.

AB The scientific community, experts in technology and marketing have been seeking cost-competitive and green solvents with good dissolving capacity for the valorisation of biomass and biowaste. Along with traditional solvents and techniques, deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and their bio-analogues, natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs) are currently emerging as a new class of promising liquid media. In this review, a comprehensive summary of recent contribution of DESs to the processing and valorisation of various kinds of plant and animal based biomass and biowaste is provided. In the field of food industry based and agro-forest waste valorisation, through treatment of the waste, by-products, and natural materials by DESs, several types of compounds, such as flavonoids and other plant phenolics, phenolic acids, stilbenes, tannins, lignans, and lignin were obtained. Extraction of algae by DESs led to isolation mainly of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and nucleic acids. Vegetable oils, spent oils, residues and by-products of their processing are a rich source of phenolic compounds such as phenolic acids and phenolic alcohols, secoiridoid derivatives (aglycone and ligstroside), lignans (pino and acetoxypinoresinol), flavones (luteolin and apigein), tocopherols and tocotrienols. Dietary fibre serves as a source of lignin, pectic substances, gums, resistant starch, inulin, as well as non-carbohydrate components, e.g., polyphenols, waxes, saponins, cutin, phytates, resistant proteins. Valorisation of wastes originated from animal processing by DESs means obtaining high-value chemicals including amino acids, proteins, bioactive peptides, collagen peptides, albumin etc. Through the valorisation of the mentioned waste types value-added products with potential applications in the pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic industries are produced. The paper gathered data on the used DESs, treated substances and obtained products, together with treatment conditions and the products yields. The evaluation of the state-of-the-art in the field of biowaste valorisation using DESs and NADESs led to conclusions and indication of future prospects and predicted development in this field.

AB Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has extended rapidly all over the world in the last decades affecting humans of all ages, inducing severe illness such as the autoimmune Guillain-Barre syndrome as well as fetal neurodevelopmental defects. Despite the epidemiological importance of ZIKV, today there are no commercially available drugs or vaccines to combat or prevent this infection. Microalgae are attractive hosts to produce and deliver vaccines, with some candidates under preclinical evaluation. Herein, algae-based expression was assessed for the production of a new vaccine candidate against ZIKV called ZK. The Algevir technology was applied to express an antigenic protein called ZK comprising the B subunit of the heat labile Escherichia coli enterotoxin along with 3 epitopes from the ZIKV envelope glycoprotein. Efficient expression of the ZK antigen was achieved in Schizochytrium sp. with yields of up to 365 mu g g(-1) microalgae fresh weight. Upon oral administration in mice, the microalgae-made ZK protein elicited significant humoral responses at a higher magnitude to those induced upon subcutaneous immunization. The algae-made ZK vaccine represents a promising candidate to formulate attractive vaccines against ZIKV.

Here we describe rational engineering of the shikimate and related pathways in Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC13032 for over-producing 4HBA. As an approach to increase the carbon flux to 4HBA, we first introduced a mutated chorismate-pyruvate lyase (CPLpr) and feedback-resistant 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate synthases encoded by ubiC(pr) and aroF(fbr) /aroG(fbr), respectively, from Escherichia coli along with blockage of carbon flux to the biosynthetic pathways for aromatic amino acids and the catabolic pathway for 4HBA by deletion of the genes trpE (encoding anthranilate synthase I), csm (chorismate mutase), and pobA (4HBA hydroxylase). In particular, CPLpr less sensitive to product inhibition was incorporated into the microorganism to enhance the conversion of chorismate to 4HBA. The subsequent steps involved expression of aroE (shikimate kinase) and aroCKB in the shikimate pathway and deletion of qsuABD coding for enzymes involved in the quinate/shikimate degradation pathway. Finally, to reduce accumulation of pathway intermediates, shikimate and 3-dehydroshikimate, shikimate-resistant AroK from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii was introduced. The resulting strain was shown to produce 19.0 g/L (137.6 mM) of 4HBA with a molar yield of 9.65% after 65 h in a fed-batch fermentation. The engineered strain can also be effectively applied for the production of other products derived from the shikimate pathway.

AB Galactosylation as part of N-glycan processing is conducted by a set of beta-1,4-galactosyltransferases (B4GALTs), with B4GALT1 as the dominant isoenzyme for this reaction. Nevertheless, the exact contributions of this key-player as well as of the other isoenzymes involved in N-glycosylation, B4GALT2, B4GALT3 and B4GALT4, have not been studied in-depth.
   To increase the understanding of the protein-and site-specific activities of individual galactosyltransferases in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells, a panel of triple deletion cell lines was generated that expressed only one isoform of B4GALT each. Two model proteins were selected for this study to cover a large spectrum of possible N-glycan structures: erythropoietin and deamine-oxidase. They were expressed as Fc-fusion constructs (EPO-Fc and Fc-DAO) and their N-glycan processing status was analyzed by site-specific mass spectrometry. The sole activity of B4GALT1 resulted in a decrease of 15-21 % of fully galactosylated structures for erythropoietin, emphasizing the involvement of other isoenzymes. Interestingly, the contributions of B4GALT2 and B4GALT3 differed for the two model proteins. Unexpectedly, removal of galactosyltransferases influenced the overall process of N-glycan maturation, with the result of a higher occurrence of poorly processed oligosaccharides.
   In the context of high productivity cell lines, which can push N-glycan maturation towards incomplete galactosylation, galactosyltransferases are potential targets to ensure stable product quality. In view of our results, specifically engineered "designer" cell lines may be required for different proteins.

AB Pseudomonas is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria. Many members of this genus displayed remarkable physiological and metabolic activity against different plant pathogens. However, Pseudomonas mosselii has not yet been characterized in biocontrol against plant disease. Here we isolated a strain of P. mosselii BS011 from the rhizosphere soil of rice plants, and the isolate showed strong inhibitory activity against the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Further we sequenced the complete genome of BS011, which consist of 5.75 Mb with a circular chromosome, 5,170 protein-coding genes, 23 rRNA and 78 tRNA operons. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that seven gene clusters may be involved in the biosynthesis of metabolites. Gene deletion experiments demonstrated that the gene cluster c-xtl is required for inhibitory activity against M. oryzae. Bioassay showed that the crude extract from BS011 fermentation sample significantly inhibited the development of M. oryzae at a concentration of 10 mu g/ml. Besides, we illustrated that the crude extract of BS011 impaired the appressorial formation in a dose dependent manner. Collectively our results revealed that P. mosselii BS011 is a promising biocontrol agent and the gene cluster c-xtl is essential for inhibiting the development of M. oryzae.

AB The current study focuses on the analysis of in vitro biological activity of extract from bark of Norway spruce (Picea Abies), which can find potential application in food and cosmetic industry and pharmacology. Milled bark was subjected to Soxhlet extraction and supercritical fluid extraction to obtain two ethanol extracts. These extracts were further used to obtain their pre-extracts to n-hexane. It was investigated whether beta-sitosterol exhibits bacteriostatic activity necessary to observe antimicrobial and antifungal activity of methyl dehydroabiatate. This synergic effect and bacteriostatic activity of beta-sitosterol have not been previously reported. The greatest inhibition zone of n-hexane pre-extracts was confirmed in bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0,9 - 1,5 cm) and yeast Alternaria alternata (0,7 - 1,6 cm). It is novel, the antioxidant, antimicrobial and antifungal activity of spruce bark extracts assessed in terms of food and cosmetic fortification.

AB Lactococcus lactis strains constitute one of the most important starter cultures for cheese production. In this study, a genome-wide analysis was performed including 68 available genomes of L. lactis group strains showing the existence of two species (L. lactis and L. cremoris) and two biovars (L. lactis biovar. diacetylactis and L. cremoris biovar. lactis). The proposed classification scheme revealed coherency among phenotypic (through in silico and in vivo bacterial function profiling), phylogenomic (through maximum likelihood trees) and genomic (using overall genome sequence-based parameters) approaches. Strain biodiversity for the industrial biovar. diacetylactis was also analyzed, finding they are formed by at least three variants with the CC1 clonal complex as the only one distributed worldwide. These findings and methodologies will help improve the selection of L. lactis group strains for industrial use as well as facilitate the interpretation of previous or future research studies on this diverse group of bacteria.

AB Inhibition of sodium ion (Na+) on Zymomonas mobilis represents an important obstacle for efficient cellulosic ethanol production. This study screened and overexpressed the genes responsible for transporting metal ions in Z. mobilis for increasing its Na+ tolerance. The ZMO0119 gene encoding Na+/H+ antiporter was identified to be highly effective for reducing intracellular Na+ concentration of Z. mobilis by improving the Na+ transport capacity. Overexpression of ZMO0119 gene in Z. mobilis significantly accelerated the cell growth, glucose consumption, and cellulosic ethanol production from the dry acid pretreated and biodetoxified corn stover feedstock. This study provided an important gene responsible for increasing the cellulosic ethanol fermentability by Z. mobilis.

AB Strategies for biotechnology must take account of opportunities for research, innovation and business growth. At a regional level, public-private collaborations provide potential for such growth and the creation of centres of excellence. By considering recent progress in areas such as genomics, healthcare diagnostics, synthetic biology, gene editing and bio-digital technologies, opportunities for smart, strategic and specialised investment are discussed. These opportunities often involve convergent or disruptive technologies, combining for example elements of pharma-science, molecular biology, bioinformatics and novel device development to enhance biotechnology and the life sciences. Analytical applications use novel devices in mobile health, predictive diagnostics and stratified medicine. Synthetic biology provides opportunities for new product development and increased efficiency for existing processes. Successful centres of excellence should promote public-private business partnerships, clustering and global collaborations based on excellence, smart strategies and innovation if they are to remain sustainable in the longer term.

The CLEA retained 100% phytase activity up to 50 degrees C and 70% activity at 70 degrees C after 6 h incubation while soluble enzyme lost 50% activity at 50 degrees C and 80% at 70 degrees C. Soluble phytase has an optimum pH of 2.1 while immobilized enzyme maintains high level of activity in a broad pH range of 1-6. CLEA also retain 80% activity upon proteolytic hydrolysis with pepsin, pancreatin, trypsin and chymotrypsin, while soluble enzyme loses 40% activity under same conditions. Phytase CLEA were recycled for 5 times without loss in activity using a stirred basket reactor.

AB This paper is focused on the assessment of the production of algae in batch bioreactors. Hydraulic retention time, carbon loading rate and light color were the inputs of the study and algae production the main output. Bioreactors were operated in semi-continuous mode and tests lasted two months, more than two times the period required to meet a steady-state response. This steady-state was verified with plateau responses in both, soluble parameters and suspended solids. Results points out the great relevance of temperature. Likewise, they show that green light improves the production of algae, as well as long HRT and high CLR. Maximum production rates attained were in the range 4-14 mg d(-1) L-1. The ratio COD /TSS for this biofuel was almost constant (3.13 mg COD mg(-1) TSS) but the quality of the product obtained in terms of the Mean Oxidation State of Carbon is completely different. Longer HRT leads to lower MOSC and hence to potentially more valuable fuels.

AB During tumour development, macrophages are recruited to the tumour site and orientated towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Due to their immunosuppressive function, tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) are recognized as major components in tumour progression. Changing these macrophages to a pro-inflammatory phenotype is thus extensively studied as a potential means for developing novel anti-tumour therapy. In this context, we found that the Proprotein convertase 1/3 (PC1/3) is a relevant target. Proteomic analysis reveals that PC1/3 knockdown (KD) macrophages present all the characteristic of activated pro-inflammatory macrophages. Moreover, in PC1/3 KD macrophages, TLR4 and TLR9 signaling pathways can be enhanced leading to the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors and anti-tumour factors. To develop an efficient anti-tumour immunotherapy, we may (i) target TAMs directly inside the tumour site for PC1/3 inhibition and TLR activation and used them as "Trojan macrophages" or (ii) directly take advantage of PC1/3 inhibited macrophages and use them as "drone macrophages" by activating them "at distance" with a TLR ligand. Therefore, PC1/3 inhibited macrophages constitute an innovative cell therapy to treat tumours efficiently.

AB For almost a century, aluminum (Al) in the form of Al oxyhydroxide (a crystalline compound), Al hydroxyphosphate (an amorphous Al phosphate hydroxide), Al phosphate, and Al potassium sulfate has been used to improve the immunogenicity of vaccines. Al is currently included in vaccines against tetanus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, human papillomavirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. Official health authorities consider the inclusion of Al in most of the presently recommended vaccines to be extremely effective and sufficiently safe. However, the inclusion of Al salts in vaccines has been debated for several years because of studies that seem to indicate that chronic Al exposure through vaccine administration can interfere with cellular and metabolic processes leading to severe neurologic diseases. Children, who in their first years of life receive several vaccine doses over a reduced period of time, would be most susceptible to any risk that might be associated with vaccines or vaccine components. The main aim of this paper was to discuss the data presently available regarding Al neurotoxicity and the risk for children receiving vaccines or other pharmaceutical preparations containing AI. Analysis of the literature showed that no apparent reason exists to support the elimination of Al from vaccines for fear of neurotoxicity. The only problem that deserves attention is the suggested relationship between Al oxyhydroxide-containing vaccines and macrophagic myofaciitis or myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. Currently, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn on these risks and further studies must be conducted. Until then, Al remains the best solution to improve vaccine efficacy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This post-hoc analysis of data from a matched cohort study investigated the risk of febrile convulsions (FC) 5-12 days post-first dose of measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine (MMRV) in a low-risk population, compared to measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and varicella (V) vaccines administered separately.
   The low-risk population excluded children with personal history of FC (Scenario 1) and children with personal or/and family history (>= 1 parent/sibling) of FC (Scenario 2).
   Incidence of FC post-MMRV in Scenario 2 (excluding at risk children) (36.3-49.5/100,000) and post-MMR+V in the whole cohort including children with personal/family history of FC (43.6/100,000) were similar. The risk difference of FC increased by 0.2 case/100,000 in Scenario 1 and decreased by 5.3-8.6 cases/100,000 of vaccinated children in Scenario 2, compared to the whole cohort.
   The overall risk of FC post-first dose MMRV vaccination could be lowered by administering MMRV only to children with no personal or family history of FC. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bluetongue virus (BTV) antibodies were analysed in 27 Swiss calves born in 2016 at the age of 16-19 days using competitive enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay (cELISA) and virus neutralization test (VNT) (animal trial permission number: 75684). Obligatory documentation proved that 15 of 27 dams were BTV-8 vaccinated once or three times in 2008-2010. The offsprings of the non-vaccinated dams were seronegative. Two of three calves and 11 of 12 calves descending from dams who had been vaccinated one or three times, respectively, had BTV specific serum antibodies. As Switzerland is considered BTV-free from 2010 to 2016, it is likely that BTV-8 antibodies were transferred via colostrum. Furthermore, we confirmed neutralizing cross-reactivity of BTV-8 with BTV-4 antibodies as 5 samples positive for BTV-8 were also reactive with BTV-4 antibodies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Globally, infant and childhood vaccine uptake rates are not high enough to control vaccine preventable diseases, with outbreaks occurring even in high-income countries. This has led a number of high-, middle-and low income countries to enact, strengthen or contemplate mandatory infant and/or childhood immunization to try to address the gap. Mandatory immunization that reduces or eliminates individual choice is often controversial. There is no standard approach to mandatory immunization. What vaccines are included, age groups covered, program flexibility and rigidity e.g. opportunities for opting out, penalties or incentives, degree of enforcement, and whether a compensation program for causally associated serious adverse events following immunization exists vary widely. We present an overview of mandatory immunization with examples in two high- and one low-income countries to illustrate variations, summarize limited outcome data related to mandatory immunization, and suggest key elements to consider when contemplating mandatory infant and/or child immunization. Before moving forward with mandatory immunization, governments need to assure financial sustainability, uninterrupted supply and equitable access to all the population. Other interventions may be more effective and less intrusive than mandatory. If mandatory is implemented, this needs to be tailored to fit the context and the country's culture.

AB The proportion of the population >= 65 years old is about 17% today and will be about 27% in 2050 worldwide. The problem, however, is not ageing in itself, it is individual disabilities associated with ageing. This manuscript summarizes the consensus points reached during a pan-European meeting on gaps and barriers in making vaccination of adults aged 50+ a reality and on further joint actions in Europe. The shift from childhood to life-long vaccination is essential to prevent disability, morbidity and mortality in the elderly and promote healthy ageing. This vaccination shift is a major challenge in the post-truth, media based era in countries with dwindling resources for the provision of healthcare. The challenge can be met only by adopting an innovative approach designed to shift the mindset of decision-makers from treatment to prevention. A number of key actions are required and for these actions a European multidisciplinary network including health authorities, medical doctors with different specialties, sociologists, psychologists, pharmaceutical companies and Associations of patients appears mandatory.

AB Introduction: Patients with a weakened immune system due to immunosuppressive treatment are at increased risk of infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Although pneumococcal vaccination is highly recommended for those patients, the effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination in this population remains largely unknown. Therefore, the objective of this PROSPERO-registered systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of the most commonly prescribed immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine, methotrexate, anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF alpha), or rituximab, on the initial serologic response to pneumococcal vaccination in patients with auto-immune disease.
   Methods: We included 22 articles comprising 2077 patients, of whom 1623 were treated with immuno-suppressive agents, and 454 were controls.
   Results and discussion: The findings of our systematic review indicate that, in patients treated with immunosuppressive medication and compared to controls, the initial serologic response to pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) are impaired. Moreover, this impaired response was more profound after PCV than after PPSV. We hypothesize that the immunosuppressive medication mainly compromises the cellular immunity, explaining the more severely reduced response rate to PCV (which induces a T-cell dependent immune response), compared to PPSV. Treatment with TNF alpha blocking agents was associated with a more favorable response, compared to patients treated with other immunosuppressive medication. Targeted research applying uniform correlates of protection is needed to bridge the knowledge gap in vaccination immunology in this patient group. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Bacterial meningitis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide among children aged 1-59 months. We aimed to describe its burden in South Asia, focusing on vaccine-preventable aetiologies.
   Methods: We searched five databases for studies published from January 1, 1990, to April 25, 2017. We estimated incidence and aetiology-specific proportions using random-effects meta-analysis. In secondary analyses, we described vaccine impact and pneumococcal meningitis serotypes.
   Results: We included 48 articles cumulatively reporting 20,707 cases from 1987 to 2013. Mean annual incidence was 105 (95% confidence interval [CI], 53-173) cases per 100,000 children. On average, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) accounted for 13% (95% CI, 8-19%) of cases, pneumococcus for 10% (95% CI, 6-15%), and meningococcus for 1% (95% CI, 0-2%). These meta-analyses had substantial between-study heterogeneity (I-2 > 78%, P < 0.0001). Among studies reporting only confirmed cases, these three bacteria caused a median of 78% cases (IQR, 50-87%). Hib meningitis incidence declined by 72-83% at sentinel hospitals in Pakistan and Bangladesh, respectively, within two years of implementing nationwide vaccination. On average, PCV10 covered 49% (95% CI, 39-58%), PCV13 covered 51% (95% CI, 40-61%), and PPSV23 covered 74% (95% CI, 67-80%) of pneumococcal meningitis serotypes. Lower PCV10 and PCV13 serotype coverage in Bangladesh was associated with higher prevalence of serotype 2, compared to India and Pakistan.
   Conclusions: South Asia has relatively high incidence of bacterial meningitis among children aged 1-59 months, with vaccine-preventable bacteria causing a substantial proportion. These estimates are likely underestimates due to multiple epidemiological and microbiological factors. Further research on vaccine impact and distribution of pneumococcal serotypes will inform vaccine policymaking and implementation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: The objectives of this study were to estimate the national prevalence of hepatitis B infection in Tunisia using data from a nationwide survey, to compare results with those obtained in 1996 survey and to evaluate the impact of vaccination twenty years after its introduction.
   Methods: A National household-based cross sectional and serological survey was undertaken in 2015 from randomly selected districts using two-stage sampling. Data collection was performed using standardized and pretested questionnaires and collected blood samples were tested for markers of hepatitis B virus infection.
   Results: National point prevalence of Hepatitis B surface antigen was 1.7% (95% CI[1.6-1.9%]). The highest prevalence was found in the Center and South regions with respectively 2.3% (95% CI [2.0-2.7%]) and 2.2% (95% CI [1.8-2.8%]). Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was 88.6% (95% CI (81.5-93.0%]) and was higher among population aged less than 20 years 96.1% (95% CI [70.1-99.5%]) than those aged more than 20 years 59.0% (95% CI [32.0-75.3%]). VE was 85.6% (95% CI [65.8-93.9%]) is hyper-endemic areas and 89.1% (95% CI [80.3-94.0%]) in meso-endemic and hypo-endemic areas.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of Hepatitis B surface antigen decreased compared to previous estimations and classify Tunisia as a low endemic country as result to the introduction of vaccination since 1995. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Malaria continues to be one of the world's most devastating infectious tropical diseases, and alternative strategies to prevent infection and disease spread are urgently needed. These strategies include the development of effective vaccines, such as malaria transmission blocking vaccines (TBV) directed against proteins found on the sexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum parasites present in the mosquito midgut. The Pfs25 protein, which is expressed on the surface of gametes, zygotes and ookinetes, has been a primary target for TBV development. One such vaccine strategy based on Pfs25 is a plant-produced malaria vaccine candidate engineered as a chimeric non-enveloped virus-like particle (VLP) comprising Pfs25 fused to the Alfalfa mosaic virus coat protein. This Pfs25 VLP-FhCMB vaccine candidate has been engineered and manufactured in Nicotiana benthamiana plants at pilot plant scale under current Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines. The safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Pfs25 VLP-FhCMB was assessed in healthy adult volunteers. This Phase 1, dose escalation, first-in-human study was designed primarily to evaluate the safety of the purified plant-derived Pfs25 VLP combined with Alhydrogel (R) adjuvant. At the doses tested in this Phase 1 study, the vaccine was generally shown to be safe in healthy volunteers, with no incidence of vaccine-related serious adverse events and no evidence of any dose-limiting or dose-related toxicity, demonstrating that the plant-derived Pfs25 VLP-FhCMB vaccine had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. In addition, although the vaccine did induce Pfs25-specific IgG in vaccinated patients in a dose dependent manner, the transmission reducing activity of the antibodies generated were weak, suggesting the need for an alternative vaccine adjuvant formulation.

AB Background: The RV3-BB human neonatal rotavirus vaccine aims to provide protection from severe rotavirus disease from birth. The aim of the current study was to characterise the rotavirus strains causing gastroenteritis during the Indonesian Phase lib efficacy trial.
   Methods: A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial involving 1649 participants was conducted from January 2013 to July 2016 in Central Java and Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Participants received three doses of oral RV3-BB vaccine with the first dose given at 0-5 days after birth (neonatal schedule), or the first dose given at similar to 8 weeks after birth (infant schedule), or placebo (placebo schedule). Stool samples from episodes of gastroenteritis were tested for rotavirus using EIA testing, positive samples were genotyped by RT-PCR. Full genome sequencing was performed on two representative rotavirus strains.
   Results: There were 1110 episodes of acute gastroenteritis of any severity, 105 episodes were confirmed as rotavirus gastroenteritis by EIA testing. The most common genotype identified was G3P[8] (90/105), the majority (52/56) of severe (Vesikari score >= 11) rotavirus gastroenteritis episodes were due to the G3P[8] strain. Full genome analysis of two representative G3P[8] samples demonstrated the strain was an inter-genogroup reassortant, containing an equine-like G3 VP7, P[8] VP4 and a genogroup 2 backbone I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2. The complete genome of the Indonesian equine-like G3P[8] strain demonstrated highest genetic identity to G3P[8] strains circulating in Hungary and Spain.
   Conclusions: The dominant circulating strain during the Indonesian Phase lib efficacy trial of the RV3-BB vaccine was an equine-like G3P[8] strain. The equine-like G3P[8]strain is an emerging cause of severe gastroenteritis in Indonesia and in other regions. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: By pairing diluent with vaccines, dual-chamber vaccine injection devices simplify the process of reconstituting vaccines before administration and thus decrease associated open vial wastage and adverse events. However, since these devices are larger than current vaccine vials for lyophilized vaccines, manufacturers need guidance as to how the size of these devices may affect vaccine distribution and delivery.
   Methods: Using HERMES-generated immunization supply chain models of Benin, Bihar (India), and Mozambique, we replace the routine 10-dose measles-rubella (MR) lyophilized vaccine with single-dose MR dual-chamber injection devices, ranging the volume-per-dose (5.2-26 cm(3)) and price-per-dose ($0.70, $1.40).
   Results: At a volume-per-dose of 5.2 cm(3), a dual-chamber injection device results in similar vaccine availability, decreased open vial wastage (OVW), and similar total cost per dose administered as compared to baseline in moderately constrained supply chains. Between volumes of 7.5 cm(3) and 26 cm(3), these devices lead to a reduction in vaccine availability between 1% and 14% due to increases in cold chain storage utilization between 1% and 7% and increases in average peak transport utilization between 2% and 44%. At the highest volume-per-dose, 26 cm(3), vaccine availability decreases between 9% and 14%. The total costs per dose administered varied between each scenario, as decreases in vaccine procurement costs were coupled with decreases in doses administered. However, introduction of a dual-chamber injection device only resulted in improved total cost per dose administered for Benin and Mozambique (at 5.2 cm(3) and $0.70-per-dose) when the total number of doses administered changed <1% from baseline.
   Conclusion: In 3 different country supply chains, a single-dose MR dual-chamber injection device would need to be no larger than 5.2 cm(3) to not significantly impair the flow of other vaccines. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In October 2014, a routine pneumococcal vaccination programme in the elderly aged 65-100 years old was initiated in Japan. Currently, this programme is within a transitional period. Eligibility for subsidy under the programme is granted for target ages in 5-year increments, over a 5-year roll-out period. We assessed the impact of the routine vaccination programme on vaccination coverage and explored the factors relating to pneumococcal vaccine uptake. We conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey in 2015 for respondents aged 65-79 years. A total of 3889 respondents answered the survey. The vaccination coverage in this study was estimated as 33.5%. Of the total respondents, 3327 were not vaccinated at initiation of the routine vaccination programme. The uptake of vaccination after implementation of the programme among them was 22.3%. There was a significant relationship between vaccination and eligibility for subsidy under the routine vaccination programme (adjusted odds ratio: 16.7). While there are some limitations to this study, introduction of the routine vaccination programme might affect pneumococcal vaccination coverage in the elderly. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have potential to prevent significant proportion of childhood pneumonia. Finnish Invasive Pneumococcal disease vaccine trial was designed to assess the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the 10-valent pneumococcal Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV10) against several outcomes. We now report results for pneumonia.
   Methods: In this nationwide, cluster-randomised, double-blind trial, children younger than 19 months received PHiD-CV10 in 52 clusters or hepatitis vaccines as control in 26 clusters. Infants younger than 7 months at the first vaccination received either 3+1 or 2+1 vaccination schedule, children aged 711 months received 2+1, and those 12-18 months of age two-dose schedule. All hospitalizations and outpatient visits to hospital associated with ICD-10 codes compatible with pneumonia were identified through the National Care Register and 1-3 frontal chest X-ray images per event were collected. External readers who were unaware of the patients' vaccination status retrospectively interpreted the images. The evaluated outcomes were hospital-diagnosed, hospital-treated pneumonia as primary diagnosis, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia during the blinded, intention-to-treat follow-up period from the first vaccination to the end of 2011. Total VE was calculated as 1 minus rate ratio of all pneumonia episodes.
   Results: 47 366 children were enrolled from February 2009, to October 2010. VE against all episodes of hospital-diagnosed pneumonia was 27% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14%, 38%), 32% (95% CI: 3%, 52%), and 23% (95% CI: -5%, 44%) in subjects enrolled at age <7, 7-11, and 12-18 months, respectively. Corresponding rate reductions were 3.4, 4.7, and 2.5 per 1000 person-years. VE estimates against pneumonia with alveolar consolidation or pleural effusion (WHO criteria) in the three cohorts were 45% (95% CI: 26%, 60%), 56% (95% CI: 14%, 77%), and 48% (95% CI: 2%, 73%), respectively.
   Conclusion: PHiD-CV10 vaccination remarkably reduced disease burden due to pneumonia in infants and young children. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   DISEASE
AB Background: Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination is a widely-used public health intervention for tuberculosis (TB) control. In Taiwan, like other intermediate TB burden settings, steadily declining TB incidence raises important questions on whether universal BCG vaccination should be discontinued. Recent surveys on adverse events following immunisation, such as BCG-induced osteomyelitis/osteitis, also suggest a need to re-evaluate the vaccination programme.
   Methods: We developed an age-structured transmission dynamic model, calibrated to population demography and age-specific TB notification rates in Taiwan. We adopted 'weak-protection' and 'strong-protection' scenarios, representing a range of characteristics including the duration of BCG pro-tection and vaccine efficacies against TB infection and progression. We estimated averted disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and incremental costs over 10 years after discontinuing universal BCG vaccination in 2018, 2035, and 2050. We also examined the potential impact of 'surveillance-guided' dis-continuation, triggered once notification rates fall to a given threshold.
   Results: In the weak-protection scenario, discontinuing BCG would result in 2.8 (95% uncertainty range: 2.3, 3.1) additional notified TB cases and -4.1 (-7.7, 0.8) net averted DALYs over 2018-2027. In the strong-protection scenario, 82.9 (72.6, 91.6) additional cases and -402.7 (-506.6, -301.2) averted DALYs would be reported, suggesting a robustly negative health impact. However, in this vaccine scenar-io, there could be an overall health benefit if BCG is discontinued once TB notification falls below 5 per 100,000 population. The most influential vaccine characteristic for the net health impact is the vaccine efficacy against progression to pulmonary TB. In financial terms, the eliminated cost of the vaccination programme substantially outweighed the incremental cost for TB treatment regardless of BCG protection.
   Conclusions: BCG discontinuation may be warranted in intermediate burden settings, depending on the quality of vaccine protection, and the potential for refocusing on other TB control activities for earlier detection and treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Within-season influenza vaccine waning suggests potential net benefits
   to delayed vaccination in older adults in the United States
SO VACCINE

DT Article
DE Influenza; Waning; Timing; Intraseason; Immunization; Elderly
ID RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; ANTIBODY
AB Background: There is growing evidence that there is within (intra-) season waning of influenza vaccine protection in older adults, suggesting there may be a benefit to giving influenza vaccine closer to the time of increased infection risk. We aimed to quantitatively evaluate the impact of modifying the timing of influenza vaccination in U.S. older adults.
   Methods: Using historical data (2010/2011-2015/2016, inclusive) on influenza activity and vaccine uptake, we explore the optimal time to begin vaccinating older adults (>= 65 years) in the U.S. to maximize prevention of influenza. We modelled the effect of changing the timing of vaccination by estimating the percentage change to the current disease burden and used this to calculate the estimated optimal week to begin vaccination in the U.S.
   Results: When we assumed a relatively slower waning protection rate (over 52 weeks), the estimated optimal time to begin vaccinating those aged >= 65 years varied between mid-August (week 34, 2012-2013) and mid-late October (week 43, 2011-2012) depending on the season, resulting in 0.44% and 5.11% of the current disease burden prevented respectively. Under faster waning (over 26 weeks), the estimated optimal week varied between early September (week 37, 2012-2013) and mid-November (week 47, 2011-2012), resulting in 3.69% and 11.97% of the current disease burden prevented respectively.
   Conclusions: While it is difficult to determine the ideal time to start to vaccinate due to substantial variation in timing of individual seasons, we found that there are potentially substantial benefits to minimizing the time between vaccination and influenza activity in U.S. older adults. Modest delays in immunization were beneficial in the seasons we evaluated. If further evidence suggests fast waning, longer delays may be warrant as in these scenarios the timing of the current vaccination was often very suboptimal. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Little is known about inactivated influenza vaccine effectiveness (WE) in preventing very severe disease, including influenza-associated intensive care unit (ICU) admissions.
   Methods: The Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance (SHIVERS) project enrolled adults (aged >= 18 years) with acute respiratory illness (ARI) in general ward (GW) hospital settings (n = 3034) and ICUs (n = 101) during 2012-2015. IVE was assessed using a test-negative design comparing the odds of influenza vaccination among influenza positives vs. negatives (confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). All models were adjusted for season, weeks from season peak, and a vaccination propensity score.
   Results: Influenza virus infection was confirmed in 28% of GW hospital and 41% of ICU patients; influenza vaccination was documented for 56% and 41%, respectively. Across seasons, IVE was 37% (95% confidence intervals [CI] = 23-48%) among GW patients and 82% (95% CI = 45-94%) among ICU patients. IVE point estimates were > 70% against ICU influenza and consistently higher than IVE against GW influenza when stratified by season, by virus (sub)types, and for adults with or without chronic medical conditions and for both adults aged <65 and >= 65 years old. Among hospitalized influenza positives, influenza vaccination was associated with a 59% reduction in the odds of ICU admission (aOR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.18-0.96) and with shorter ICU lengths of stay (LOS), but not with radiograph-confirmed pneumonia or GW hospital LOS.
   Conclusion: Inactivated influenza vaccines prevented influenza-associated ICU admissions, may have higher effectiveness in ICU than GW hospital settings, and appeared to reduce the risk of severe disease among those who are infected despite vaccination.

AB Background: A bivalent HPV vaccine (Cervarix (R); HPV2, GlaxoSmithKline) was introduced into the Finnish national vaccination programme (NVP) in November 2013 for girls aged 11-13 years with a catch-up for 14-15 year-olds. We evaluated the association between HPV2 and selected autoimmune diseases and clinical syndromes by conducting a nation-wide retrospective register-based cohort study.
   Methods: First life-time occurrences of the relevant ICD-10 codes in girls aged 11-15 years between Nov-2013 and Dec-2016 were obtained from the national hospital discharge register. Population denominators were obtained from the Population Information System and vaccination records from the National Vaccination Register. Registers were linked using unique personal identity codes. Association between HPV2 and 38 selected outcomes were studied using Cox regression, with age as the main time-scale and the first vaccination dose as the time-dependent exposure. The hazard ratios (HR) with 95%CI were assessed according to the time since exposure (entire follow-up, 0-180/181-365/>365 days).
   Results: Of 240 605 girls eligible for HPV2 vaccination, 134 615 (56%) were vaccinated. After adjustment for geographical area (6 hospital districts), country of origin (Finnish-born/not) and number of hospital contacts from 9 through 10 years of age, HRs ranged from 0.34 (95%CI 0.11-1.05) to 8.37 (95%CI 0.85-82.54) and HPV2 vaccination was not statistically significantly associated with a higher risk of any outcome during the entire follow-up.
   Conclusions: This study found no significantly increased risk for the selected outcomes after the HPV vaccination in girls 11-15 years of age. These results provide valid evidence to counterbalance public scepticism, fears of adverse events and possible opposition to HPV vaccination and consequently can contribute to increase HPV vaccination coverage in Finland as well as elsewhere.

AB A simulation of a 50 MWe power plant with thermocline tank as storage shows that there is no deterioration of the thermocline performance with cycling (successive charges and discharges), because no temperature threshold has to be taken into account during charges. Indeed, the best control strategy when the thermocline outlet fluid temperature increases during charge is defocusing a part of the solar field to avoid the heat transfer fluid overheating. Thus, thermocline tank can be fully charged during summer days. During winter days, if there is not enough energy to perform a full charge, cycling effect does not occur because the remaining energy after partial discharge implies a more important state of charge for the following day. Finally, the comparison between thermocline and two-tank technologies shows that oversizing the thermocline tank by 11% leads to equivalent electricity production, for a lower cost (at least 22.3%).

AB The paper analyzes some of the problems connected with the design, construction and management of cogeneration plants for district heating networks (CHP-DHN). Although the advantages of cogeneration systems compared with conventional ones for separate energy production, one of the unresolved problems is that of the variability of operating conditions, can often render the application of these solutions ineffective. In particular, the aim of this study is to propose a multi-objective optimization methodology that tries to take into account both energy and economic aspects.
   After an analysis of the current scenario, the application and use of CHP plants in the international context and the main technological features, followed by the identification of incentive systems that have allowed or limited the spread, attempts are made to define a design methodology based on a multi-level optimum design based approach for increasing the operation share of CHP. The methodology starts from a general system vision, up to detailed aspects such as the management of a CHP-DHN system, taking into account the multiplicity of variables and constraints involved. This methodology has been applied to two case studies representative of the different applications, to verify its robustness and analyze the possible results obtainable.
   In particular, a general case was taken into consideration, in which a first level design was performed by analyzing various possible system configurations and evaluating their goodness through the tools provided by the aforementioned multi-objective methodology. Then the methodology has been applied to an intermediate level, taking into consideration an existing CHP-DHN plant and going to evaluate the performance considering possible modification of the operation.
   The results obtained confirm that a combined energetic and economic approach to design allows to obtain an economically feasible system, but at the same time avoids incurring over-sizing, under-sizing or functioning phenomena far from the concept of energy efficiency, difference of what happens for many plants today in operation. Furthermore, through a simple variation of the modularity of the plant, significant benefits can be obtained.

AB The influence of the addition of transition metals involving nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) on the thermal behavior and kinetic of co-pyrolysis of cellulose (CL) together with polyethylene (PE) was investigated according to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). It is found that the involvement of transition metals acting as catalysts could promote the decomposition of individual component (CL and PE) in the mixture. The initial decomposition temperature of CL and PE in the mixture is reduced by 91-136 degrees C and 8-15 degrees C, respectively, after the addition of transition metals in comparison with that of the mixture of CL and PE. Meanwhile, transition metals could intensify the synergistic interactions between CL and PE, especially during the pyrolysis stage assigned to CL decomposition. The maximum difference of weight loss in this stage is 9.30% to 14.10% for transition metals treated-mixtures while that of the mixture without transition metal treatment is 2.99%. Kinetic results show that the co-pyrolysis of transition metal-involved CL/PE mixtures can be well described as two consecutive first order reactions. The activation energy (E) of CL and PE in the mixture is reduced by 53.21-80.53 kJ/mol and 8.23-12.361cJ/mol, respectively, as transition metals were involved. In addition, the content of transition metal makes a large influence on the thermal behavior and kinetics of co-pyrolysis of CL/PE mixture.

AB The integration of more-electric technologies, such as energy storage systems (ESSs) and electric propulsion, has gained attention in recent years as a promising approach to reduce fuel consumption and emissions in the maritime industry. In this context, hybrid power systems (HPSs) with direct current (DC) distribution are currently gaining a commendable interest in research and industrial applications. This paper examines the impact of using HPS with DC distribution and a battery energy storage system (BESS) over a conventional AC power system for short haul roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ferries. An electric ferry with a HPS is modeled in this study and the power management system is simulated using the Matlab/Simulink software. The result is validated using measured load profile of a ferry. The performance of the DC HPS is compared with the conventional AC system based on fuel consumption and emission reductions. An approach to estimate the fuel consumption of the diesel engine through calculation of specific fuel oil consumption (SFOC) is also presented. This study uses two optimization techniques: a classical power management method namely Rule-Based control (RB) and a meta-heuristic power management method known as Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) to optimally manage the power sharing of the proposed HPS. Fuel consumption and emission indicators are also used to assess the performance of the two power management methods. The simulation results show that the HPS provides a 2.91% and 7.48% fuel consumption reduction using RB method and GWO method respectively. It is apparent from the result that the HPS has more fuel savings while running the diesel generator sets (DGs) at higher operational efficiency. It is interesting that the proposed HPS using both power management methods provided a 100% emission reduction at berth. Finally, it was found that using a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm provides better fuel and emission reductions than a classical method.

AB Abnormal combustion phenomena are among the main hurdles for the introduction of hydrogen in the transportation sector through the use of internal combustion engines (ICEs). For that reason the challenge is to guarantee operation free from combustion anomalies at conditions close to the ones giving the best engine output (maximum brake torque and power). To this end, an early and accurate detection of abnormal combustion events is decisive in order to allow the electronic control unit deciding suitable correcting actions. In this work, an automotive size 4-cylinder 1.4 L naturally aspirated port-fuel injection spark ignition Volkswagen engine adapted to run on hydrogen has been investigated. Three distinct methods (in-cylinder pressure, block engine vibration and acoustic measurements) have been employed to detect abnormal combustion phenomena provoked through the enrichment of the hydrogen-air mixture fed to the cylinders under a wide range of engine speeds (1000-5000 rpm). It has been found that the high-frequency components of the in-cylinder pressure and block engine acceleration signals obtained after a Fourier transform analysis can be used for very sensitive detection of knocking combustion cycles. In the case of the ambient noise measurements, a spectral analysis in terms of third octave bands of the signal recorded by a microphone allowed an accurate characterization. Combustion anomalies could be detected through more intense octave bands at frequencies between 250 Hz and 4 kHz in the case of backfire and between 8 kHz and 20 kHz for knock. Computational fluid dynamics simulations performed indicated that some characteristics of the engine used such as the cylinder valves dimensions and the hydrogen flow rate delivered by the injectors play important roles conditioning the likelihood of suffering backfire events.

AB The combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system based on biomass, geothermal energy and fossil energy contributes to less fossil fuel-dependent, alleviate the climate change and improve the flexibility of integrated system. Therefore, this paper presents a novel combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system based on biomass, natural gas and geothermal energy. The CCHP system consists of an air-biomass gasification subsystem, steam turbine electricity generation subsystem, gas turbine electricity generation subsystem, waste heat utilization subsystem and ground source heat pump subsystem. The thermodynamic and economic analysis of proposed system are investigated, and the influences of some key operating parameters (gas mass ratio and flue gas split ratio) and economic factors (such as biomass and natural gas price, interest rate, operating time coefficient and service life) on integrated system performances are also carried out. The results indicate that the introduction of natural gas contributes to improve the overall energy efficiency of proposed CCHP system and reduce the levelized cost of energy significantly. In the case study (gas mass ratio: 0.5, flue gas split ratio: 0.5), the overall energy efficiency and electricity generation efficiency of CCHP system can be reached at about 97.05% and 30.89%, respectively; the levelized cost of energy is 0.0315 $/kWh. The proposed system provides a new way for utilization of renewable energy and fossil fuels based poly-generation system, which is a promising approach for the utilization of biomass, natural gas and geothermal energy in the rural of China.

AB Incorporating paraffin wax into double glazed windows is a novel method to reduce energy consumption and adjust indoor thermal environment of buildings. However, the low thermal conductivity of paraffin wax limits the thermal performance of glazed windows. Adding nanoparticles into phase change material (PCM) is one of the effective methods to improve thermal performance. In this study, the effect of nanoparticle volume fraction and particle diameter on the temperature difference between the glass interior surface and indoor environment, and energy consumption of glazed windows containing Nano-PCM were numerically investigated for representative days of different seasons. The developed numerical model was validated with the experimental results obtained in this work. The results show that the higher nanoparticle volume fraction, the higher energy consumption, and the larger particle diameter, the smaller energy consumption. The minimal energy consumption is obtained with nanoparticle concentration of 1% and nanoparticle diameter of 100 nm for all the seasons. The magnitude of impact of the studied parameters is more significant in winter. Energy consumption can be reduced up to 4.0% by an appropriate selection of nanoparticle volume fraction and nanoparticle size. The temperature difference between interior surface of glazed windows and indoor environment are mainly concentrated in the range of 1-4 degrees C for summer, 5-10 degrees C for autumn and 14-16 degrees C for winter.

AB The efficient conversion of electrical energy to chemical energy poses new fundamental challenges in the fields of technology, economy and ecology. Currently, development of steam electrolysis technology via solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) is considered to be one of the most effective ways to produce hydrogen. Here, we present testing of the SOEC based on a new combination of the functional materials, BaCe0.5Zr0.3Dy0.2O3-delta as a proton-conducting electrolyte and Nd(1.95)Ba(0.05)Nia(4+delta) (NBN) as an oxygen electrode, which are chemically and thermally compatible. To demonstrate the performance capability and establish the most favorable operating conditions, the cell was comprehensively characterized within a wide range of temperatures (500-750 degrees C), applied electrolysis potentials (similar to 0.8-2 V) and water vapor partial pressure in anode atmospheres (0.03-0.5 atm). The results reveal that a high current density 1.21 A cm(-2) is achieved under the selected conditions (750 degrees C, 1.6 V, 0.03 atm); it increases up to 1.40 A cm(-2) with the pH(2)O increasing from 0.03 to 0.5 atm. Comparative analysis presented for similar SOEC systems allows considering the NBN as a highly attractive oxygen electrode, having a polarization resistance (R-p) of 0.05 Omega cm(2) at the selected conditions and promoting electrochemical steam electrolysis because no degradation of the R-p value (0.03 Omega cm(2)) at highly moisturizing conditions, pH(2)O = 0.50 atm.

AB For coal fired power plant, the supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle (S-CO2) is difficult to absorb flue gas heat in a wide temperature range of 120-1500 degrees C. Here, novel methods are developed to cascade utilize flue gas heat, in which energies in high, moderate and low temperature levels are extracted by top cycle, bottom cycle or flue gas cooler (FGC), and air preheater, respectively. The cascade utilization shall satisfy the criterion that CO2 temperature entering boiler for top cycle equals to CO2 temperature leaving boiler for bottom cycle. The separate-top bottom-cycle (STB) is proposed, in which no any component is shared by top and bottom cycles. Six possible bottom cycles are studied. The thermodynamics analysis is coupled with heat transfer and pressure drop analysis for whole power plant. It is found that the main vapor pressure of bottom cycle can be the "best" parameter to be adjusted over a wide range of 15-35 MPa to couple and optimize top and bottom cycles. Then, the parameter coordination principle is proposed to share specific components for top and bottom cycles. Thus, the separate cycles are converted into a connected cycle to simplify the whole system layout. The connected cycle has a power generation efficiency of 51.82% at main vapor parameters of 700 degrees C/35 MPa, significantly higher than available supercritical water-steam Rankine cycle power plant. The findings in this paper give a clue to further raise the power generation efficiency for large scale S-CO2 coal fired power plant.

AB In low temperature heat sources driven cooling/heating absorption systems, there are many equipment combinations. Usually, there are contradictions between the equipment efficiency and their economy; for example, the high efficiency-solar collector usually has a high price. So, in this paper, ten absorption cooling/heating systems with different heat sources and different absorption technologies are investigated for technical-economic-thermal analysis. The heat sources are flat plate solar collector, evacuated U-pipe solar collector and middle-temperature high efficiency solar collector and waste heat. The absorption chillers are 1-effect LiBr absorption chiller, 2-effect LiBr absorption chiller, novel 1-2 effect LiBr absorption chiller and novel high efficiency-heat-recovery ammonia water absorption system. The results show that 2-effect absorption chiller with heat source of waste heat is the most optimized choice, which lowest payback period is about 1.9 years. The second choices are the 2-effect LiBr absorption system with novel middle-temperature solar collectors/natural gases and the novel ammonia water absorption system with waste heat sources.

AB In this paper, a novel power cycle for the cascade utilization of waste heat from an offshore gas turbine is presented. Carbon dioxide is selected as the single working fluid to further simplify the power conversion system. Mathematical models for the heat recovery system are developed to investigate the improvement in thermodynamic and economic performance. Moreover, a comprehensive parametric analysis is carried out and discussed to evaluate the effects of key cycle parameters on system performance. Further, a multi-objective optimization of the system based on Artificial Bee Colony algorithm is conducted to obtain the optimal operating parameters, considering net power output and levelized energy cost as objective functions simultaneously. The results show that the presented waste heat recovery system operating at the design point can increase the net power output by 30.1% compared with the gas turbine alone. The presented cycle demonstrates superior performance than the typical cycle layout with the improvement in net power output by 5.3% and the decrease in levelized energy cost by 1.2% at optimal condition. The findings so far revealed that the proposed CO2 power cycle has potential for waste heat recovery in the offshore platform application.

AB As one of the most promising methods to convert medium- and low-temperature heat into power, organic Rankine cycle (ORC) has been widely studied. Working fluid, which plays the most important role in ORC, is the root of the huge gap on energy-efficiency between the actual cycle and ideal cycle. This paper presents the limiting thermal efficiency and limiting thermodynamics perfection of simple organic Rankine cycle (S-ORC) and regenerative organic Rankine cycle (R-ORC) in subcritical region to quantitatively describe the role of the pure working fluids. The expressions of limiting thermal efficiency and limiting thermodynamics perfection of S-ORC and R-ORC are derived respectively. 20 working fluids are employed in S-ORC and 10 working fluids are employed in R-ORC to demonstrate the effects of working fluids and operating conditions on limiting thermal efficiency and limiting thermodynamics perfection. The limiting thermal efficiency of S-ORC increases with the increase of the slope of working fluid saturated liquid line and latent heat of vaporization. The limiting thermal efficiency of R-ORC increases with the increase of the slope of working fluid saturated liquid line and latent heat of vaporization and the decrease of the slope of working fluid saturated gas line and specific heat capacity of superheat gas at constant pressure. According to the results of limiting thermal efficiency, the maps for S-ORC and R-ORC which might guide the selection of working fluids for different operating temperature are provided as well.

AB Thermal management system plays a critical role in dissipating heat and guaranteeing the safety of facilities. Among the various thermal management technologies, thermosyphon receives increased attentions owing to the fast developing demands in high-efficient cooling technology. In this paper, the heat transfer performance of an air-cooling assisted thermal management system (AATM) with ultra-thin loop thermosyphon (UTLT) is investigated with experimental method and theoretical analysis. Specifically, the effects of the assisted cooling conditions including the placement of the condenser and the consumed fan power on the start-up characteristics, operating temperature and thermal resistance of the ULLT-based system are respectively discussed. During the experiments, conventional point measurement and IR thermography are both adopted to detect the temperature variation and capture the vapor-liquid interface formed in the loop pipeline of the UTLT. By revealing the movement of vapor-liquid interface under various cooling conditions, it is verified that there always exists an optimal cooling condition for the UTLT-based AATM to start up most quickly and operates with the highest efficiency. Simply raising the cooling capacity leads to the liquid stagnation in the pipeline and triggers adverse temperature excursion. A proper regulation on the coupled cooling condition could significantly improve the operational safety and reliability of the UTLT-based AATM. In the present work, the operating temperature of the UTLT under the optimal cooling condition can be decreased by 5.2 K and the thermal resistance can be reduced by 24.2% to only 0.169 K/W. In addition, an effective model to predict the thermal performance of the UTLT-based AATM has been established with 93.6% of the experimental data in the +/- 15% error band.

Besides, some interesting aspects about employing nanofluids in cooling of electronic components are introduced. Furthermore, the opportunities for future studies as well as the challenges existing in this field are presented and discussed. It is found that applying nanofluids as novel coolants in different liquid blocks and heat pipes can considerably improve electronics cooling technology in the future.

AB According to the principles of energy grade recovery and cascade utilization, a novel cogeneration system including a gas turbine, a supercritical CO2 (S-CO2) recompression cycle, a steam power cycle and an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is proposed. In particular, a part of waste heat from the supercritical CO2 recompression cycle is used to preheat the steam power cycle, and ORC uses the zeotropic mixture as working fluid. Comprehensive thermodynamic and exergoeconomic analyses are presented for the proposed cogeneration system. Parametric studies are conducted to study the effects of key system design parameters as pressure ratio of gas turbine, pressure ratio of the S-CO2 cycle, split ratio of the S-CO2 cycle, evaporation temperature of the steam power cycle, mass fraction of isopentane in the zeotropic mixture, evaporation temperature of ORC and pinch point temperature difference in the ORC evaporator on the exergy efficiency and total product unit cost. The optimum system parameters are obtained through the multi-objective optimization method based on GA (genetic algorithm) and TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Situation) decision making. The optimization results indicate that the optimum values of exergy efficiency and total product unit cost are 69.33% and 10.77$/GJ, respectively. Furthermore, the superiority of the proposed cogeneration system is verified by comparison with other seven forms of power generation systems.

AB The concept of a hybrid solar collector was newly proposed, which has a solar thermal receiver part and air source receiver part that can operate as a fin-tube exchanger with fans when there is no solar radiation. This is the distinguishing feature of the hybrid solar collector. The solar-assisted heat pump system applying the hybrid solar collectors was also introduced. To analyze the proposed solar-assisted heat pump system, a simple thermodynamic model considering the electric power consumption for fans and circulation pumps was developed. The model results for the air-source heat gain were validated from the corresponding experimental data with the maximum error of 8.8%. Based on the parametric study, the increase of the collector area and the absorption coefficient led to the enhancement of the system performance of the solar-assisted heat pump with hybrid solar collectors. In addition, a comparative investigation was carried out for three different indirect solar-assisted heat pumps. Regarding of annual operation hour, the serial-type solar-assisted heat pump was worst at 3509 h over a year. On the other hand, the solar-assisted heat pump with hybrid solar collectors had the superior performance of 7036 h. If the efficiency of the hybrid solar collector was as superior as the conventional flat plate solar collector, the system COP of the suggested solar-assisted heat pump system in the winter season could be improved by 5.1% compared with that of the parallel-type solar-assisted heat pump system. Consequently, it clearly showed the feasibility of the suggested solar-assisted heat pump system as a standalone system for hot water supply due to the merits of significantly extending the annual operation hour, the simple system configuration, and the economic aspect with lower capital cost.

AB Experimental study we present is a full-scale energy recovery system able to extract, by means of a water source heat pump, the leftover thermal bioenergy available in a Sequencing Batch Biofilter Granular Reactor (SBBGR) within the wastewater treatment process.
   Heat pump compressor engine was powered by a 5.1 kW Photovoltaic plant, thermal energy being recovered is accumulated by two phase change materials tanks (PCM) for heat and cold latent energy storage whose capacity is 0.3 and 0.5 m(3) respectively, thermal energy excess was dissipated through evaporator and condenser devices.
   Thermal energy extracted from SBBGR ranged from 0 to 14.5 kWh as function of environmental temperature and temperature set point of SBBGR. It was largely affected by environmental temperature during radiation and no deterioration of SBBGR performances were recorded during energy extraction even at lowest temperature set point (i.e. 15 degrees C).
   Results obtained demonstrated that SBBGR technology, thanks to its particular process scheme, allows wastewater heat extraction within the treatment process operation, making it actually the only wastewater treatment system able to exchange energy at low temperature (15 degrees C) without prejudice to treatment performances and, at the same time, to operate a thermal regulation of the treatment reactors, integrating the optimization of thermo-dependent biological processes with energy recovery systems.

AB Urban heat island affects cities climate and results in higher air temperature with respect to the surrounding rural zones. Anthropogenic heat released by human activities exacerbates this phenomenon which impacts on environmental and energy fields. Air conditioning is commonly used to achieve comfort indoor conditions in the warmer urban climate but it is also one of the serious cause of the urban heat islands. The heat rejected by the condensers of air conditioning systems, increases the air temperature next to the buildings in which they are installed. In this paper a system consisting of a ground-source heat pump, a low temperature thermal network and a series of electric heat pumps, is analysed. The thermal grid is the heat source/sink for the water to water electric heat pumps that are installed at each end-user of a multi-purpose six floors building located in Naples (Southern of Italy). In cooling mode the condenser heat is discarded in the ground by the ground source heat pump that operates between the lower temperature thermal grid and the borefield. In the heating period the thermal network is heated by the ground source heat pump, that draws energy from the ground. The models simulating the energy conversion systems, the low temperature thermal network and the building, are implemented in the dynamic simulation software TRNSYS 17. A first advantage of the proposed configuration is the avoided interaction with the outside air and the corresponding mitigation of the urban heat island phenomenon. A second one is the higher coefficient of performance of the water to water electric heat pumps, operating with a lower temperature gap with respect to the case in which the electric heat pumps interact with the outside air. Furthermore, the interaction with thermal grid allows high seasonal performance due to the low fluctuation of the temperature with respect to the air. Finally this energy efficient system could be simply installed not only in the new buildings, but also in refurbishments. The proposed system is compared with a conventional one installed in each dwelling consisting of an air to water air conditioner for cooling operation and a boiler for heating. Interesting global and local environmental advantages are obtained.

Nowadays, a large field of renewable energies is under exploration for autonomous applications such as solar energy to supply pumping systems. The major disadvantage of these systems occurs during periods of low irradiance. The electrochemical battery bank is one of the solutions that can be considered. This paper deals with the comparative assessment for the feasibility of storage bank in smallscale power photovoltaic pumping system for building application. Experimental analysis of PV pumping station with storage is investigated under two dynamic head levels.

AB Antibiotics have been widely detected in livestock waste. The removal of antibiotics from livestock waste before they are exposed to the environment is crucial. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is an effective technique to deal with livestock waste. However, tetracycline was found to inhibit the AD process. In this research, effects of CaO2 addition on the tetracycline removal and methane production during the co-digestion of corn straw and chicken manure were investigated. Results showed the presence of tetracycline in AD system reduced methane yield by 8.8%. Addition of CaO2 at the dose of 0.032 g/g TVS (total volatile solid of substrate and inoculum) improved methane yield by 4.8% and shortened lag-phase by more than 2 days. Using CaO2 also accelerated the removal of tetracycline, therefore mitigated its inhibition effect. The microbial communities of the co-digestion system were also affected by tetracycline/CaO2 addition. The addition of tetracycline especially CaO2 led to increased relative abundance of microorganisms associated with complex substrate degradation. This study indicated that using CaO2 is a promising way to accelerate tetracycline removal and improve methane production during AD of antibiotic-containing organic wastes.

AB In this paper a novel multimodal hybrid bridge energy harvester (HBEH) using combined piezoelectric and electromagnetic conversion is reported. The architecture, fabrication, and characterization of the harvester is discussed. The devised HBEH consists of a permanent magnet, a wound coil, a piezoelectric plate, an airfoil, and two cantilever beams attached to a base support frame. The upper cantilever is holding a permanent magnet and an airfoil as tip mass. A piezoelectric plate is bonded on this beam near its fixed end. On the other hand, the lower beam holds a wound coil. The coil is adjusted in such a way that it is in-line and close to the permanent magnet. The harvester is capable of converting bridge vibrations and ambient wind energy into useful electrical energy to operate wireless sensor nodes (WSNs) for the health monitoring of bridges. Experimentally, the HBEH operated at three, low frequency resonant modes, ranging from 11 to 45 Hz, concentrated around 11, 38 and 43 Hz. Moreover, under sinusoidal base acceleration of 0.6 g, the harvester produced a maximum power of 2214.32 mu W across a matching impedance of 28 Omega from its electromagnetic portion at 1st resonance (11.1 Hz). However, a peak power of 155.7 mu W was generated by the harvester from its piezoelectric part under 0.4 g base excitation across 130 k Omega load resistance. Furthermore, at 6 m/s pulsating wind speed, the harvester generated load voltages of 25 mV and 114 mV from its electromagnetic and piezoelectric portions when connected to optimum load impedance of 28 Omega and 130 k Omega respectively.

AB Multigeneration technologies provide a significant potential for efficient, sustainable and economical generation of multiple useful products. A gas turbine with an air bottoming combined cycle is an attractive combined cycle configuration for small scale power generation (less than 50 MW). In this study, eight different hybrid systems are proposed for further heat recovery from a gas turbine with air bottoming combined cycle to generate different useful products including power, fresh water, cooling, hot water, and industrial process heat. For this purpose, an optimized 50 MW gas turbine with air bottoming combined cycle is integrated with several thermodynamic cycles and components such as carbon dioxide transcritical Rankine cycle, water-lithium bromide absorption cooling, ammonia-water absorption refrigeration, thermal vapor compression-multi effect distillation, heat recovery steam generator, and gas (air)-water heat exchanger. The performance of the proposed hybrid configurations is evaluated from both thermodynamic and economic viewpoints. The resulting findings demonstrate that utilization of available waste heats in a gas turbine with air bottoming cycle is beneficial to generate a significant amount of different useful products with a favorable cost. The findings of this study can be useful for development of proposed integrated systems for both residential and industrial applications.

AB The aim of this study is to provide an overview the state-of-the-art elements of text classification. For this purpose, we first select and investigate the primary and recent studies and objectives in this field. Next, we examine the state-of-the-art elements of text classification. In the following steps, we qualitatively and quantitatively analyse the related works. Herein, we describe six baseline elements of text classification including data collection, data analysis for labelling, feature construction and weighing, feature selection and projection, training of a classification model, and solution evaluation. This study will help readers acquire the necessary information about these elements and their associated techniques. Thus, we believe that this study will assist other researchers and professionals to propose new studies in the field of text classification. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The success of retention campaigns in fast-moving and saturated markets, such as the telecommunication industry, often depends on accurately predicting potential churners. Being able to identify certain behavioral patterns that lead to churn is important, because it allows the organization to make arrangements for retention in a timely manner. Moreover, previous research has shown that the decision to leave one operator for another, is often influenced by the customer's social circle. Therefore, features that represent the churn status of their connections are usually good predictors of churn when it is treated as a binary classification problem, which is the traditional approach.
   We propose a novel method to extract time series data from call networks to represent dynamic customer behavior. More precisely, we use call detail records of the customers of a telecommunication provider to build call networks on a weekly basis over the period of six months. From each network, we extract features based on each customer's connections within the network, resulting in individual time series of link-based measures. The time series are then classified using the recently proposed similarity forests method, which we further extend in various ways to accommodate multivariate time series. We show that predicting churn with customer behavior represented by time series is a suitable option. According to our results, the similarity forests method together with some of our proposed extensions, perform better than the one-nearest neighbor benchmark for time series classification. Using a time series of a single feature only, the similarity forests method performs as good as traditional churn prediction methods using more features. In fact, compared to traditional methods, similarity forests based approaches perform better when predicting further in the future, and are therefore better at detecting churn early, allowing organizations to make arrangements for retention in a timely manner.

AB The technology of music information retrieval (MIR) is an emerging field that helps in tagging each portion of an audio clip. A majority of the subtasks of MIR need an application that segments vocal and non-vocal portions. In this paper, an effort has been made to segment the vocal and non-vocal regions using some novel features based on formant structure on top of standard features. The features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), linear prediction cepstral coefficients (LPCCs), frequency domain linear prediction (FDLP) values, statistical values of pitch, jitter, shimmer, formant attack slope (FAS), formant heights from base-to-peak (FH1), peak-to-base (FH2), formant angle values at peak (FM), valley (FA2), and F5 have been considered. The classifiers such as artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forest (RF) have been considered for a comparative study as they are powerful enough to discover huge non-linear patterns. The concept of genetic algorithms with the support of neural networks has been used to select the relevant features rather considering all dimensions, named as a genetic algorithm based feature selection (GAFS). an accuracy of 89.23% before windowing and 95.16% after windowing is obtained with the optimal feature vector of length 32 using artificial neural networks. The system developed is capable of detecting singing voice segments with an accuracy of 98%. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the past, most historical research has been manually carried out by exploring historical facts reading between the lines of documents. Nowadays, historical big data has become electronically available and advances in machine learning techniques allow us to analyze the vast amount of historical data. From a historical perspective, making inferences about political stances of historical figures is important for grasping historical rivalries and power structures of an era. Thus, in this paper, we propose an approach to the systematic inference of power mechanisms based on a human network constructed from historical data. In this network, humans are linked according to the degree of kinship using genealogy records, and identified by political stances on agendas recorded in the annals of a dynasty as a political force. And then, a machine learning algorithm, semi-supervised learning, classifies humans who cannot identify political stances as political forces that reflect the links of the networks. The data consist of the genealogy of the Andong Gwon clan, a record of family relations of 10,243 people from the 10th to 15th century Korea, and the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, a historical volume that describes historical facts of the Joseon Dynasty for 472 years and is composed of 1894 fascicles and 888 books. From the data, we construct a human network based on a historically meaningful period (1443-1488), and classify people into two political forces using the proposed method. We suggest that this machine learning approach to historical study could be utilized as a potent reference tool devoid of the subjectivism of human experts in the field of history.

AB Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a frontier analysis procedure for evaluating the relative performance of decision making units (DMUs) with multiple inputs and multiple outputs. To improve its discrimination power, an important extension is proposed as cross-efficiency, which uses peer DMUs' optimal relative weights to evaluate the relative performance. However, the existing cross-efficiency methods show an inconsistent and unbalanced evaluation standard, since each DMU might determine a different total (or mean) efficiency value across all DMUs. The different values imply that the DMUs that have assigned larger cross-efficiency scores will have a larger effect in aggregating the ultimate cross-efficiency scores and different DMUs' effects are unbalanced in cross-efficiency methods. In this paper, we will deal with this unbalanced cross-efficiency evaluation problem. To this end, we first suggest a practical adjustment measure to rectify the traditional cross-efficiency, which will provide a common evaluation standard for all DMUs and make each DMU dispatch an identical total efficiency score across all DMUs. Further, we propose a game-like iterative procedure to obtain the optimal balanced cross-efficiency. Finally, we present both a numerical example and an empirical study derived from the literature and a real-world problem to demonstrate the usefulness and efficacy of the new balanced cross-efficiency evaluation approach. The work presented in this paper can extend the traditional cross-efficiency approaches to situations involving unbalanced evaluation standards, and make the evaluation results more practical significance.
