AB Mechanical properties of polyimide (PI) electrospun nanofibers could be improved by increasing imidization temperatures. However, the intrinsic mechanism on this phenomenon is highly required, which is helpful to improve mechanical properties of electrospun nanofibers by external thermal treatment. In this work, single electrospun PI nanofibers (SNF-PI) with different imidization temperatures were prepared. The nanofiber morphology was studied by SEM and AFM and the mechanical properties were measured by single fiber micro-tensile test. Polarized Raman Spectroscopy was applied to determine the PI molecular orientation in SNF-PI. The molecular orientation factor provides directly explanation on the effect of imidization temperatures on the mechanical properties of SNF-PI. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High photoluminescent (PL) nitrogen-doped carbon dots (N-CDs) have been synthesized using ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) and urea as raw materials by simple one-pot hydrothermal process. The N-CDs possess bright blue fluorescence (centred at 450 nm; 36.2% quantum yield) and green fluorescence (centred at 530 nm; 47.6% quantum yield) only by adjusting the excitation wavelength from 310 nm to 510 nm. The N-CDs exhibited high N content of 32.81 wt%, low cytotoxicity, and good PL stability at different pH values, ion strengths and temperature, respectively. As-prepared N-CDs were explored for cell imaging with great biocompatibility. The remarkable properties of N-CDs indicated their potential toward sensing and biological applications.

AB The hydrated magnesium-carbon films fabricated in this study are the novel-innovative non-oxide-type transparent electronic material. The films, which have a structure similar to that of magnesium hydroxide, were produced by making Mg-x-C-y films deposited by magnetron co-sputtering react with water vapor. As the extrinsic defect of hydration magnesium-carbon films, C atoms provided redundant electrons, resulting in a conductivity of approximately 3.31 x 10(-2) Omega.cm. Although the conductivity of hydrated magnesium-carbon films is not prominent comparing to the conventional and widely-used n-type TCO materials, e.g. ITO, the films also showed excellent optical properties, which can be attributed to their low bond energy, with the infrared transmittance of the films being greater than 72% for a plasma wavelength of approximately 10 mu m. By varying the atomic C content of the films, a visible-region transmittance greater than 80% could be realized. The optical bandgap of the films was approximately 4.04-6.87 eV and was blue-shifted because of the Moss-Burstein effect. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 0-15 wt% AgBr/Bi2WO6 nanocomposites used as visible-light-driven photocatalysts were successfully synthesized by a deposition-precipitation method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed the presence of cubic AgBr nanospheres supported on orthorhombic Bi2WO6 nanoplates. Their photocatalytic performance was investigated through the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) under visible-light irradiation within 40 min. In this research, 10 wt% AgBr/Bi2WO6 nanocomposites has the highest photocatalytic performance of 99.83% and are the promising material used for removal of contaminants in wastewater.

AB By considering the fact that oxygen vacancies are always the integral part of oxides when prepared at high temperature, variation in oxygen vacancy concentration was introduced in KNbO3 by varying calcinations temperature of precursors. A similar kind of variation was also introduced in KNbO3 by varying La3+ doping concentration. Our analysis shows that the phase formation in KNbO3 greatly responds to the variation in concentration of oxygen vacancy. It was found that, when KNbO3 bears more oxygen vacancies orthorhombic phase formation at room temperature becomes favorite otherwise cubic phase is favored. The result seems to be highly important to look insight into the mechanism of paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To meet the demand of electromagnetic interference shielding, low-cost and easily available microwave absorbers are urgently required. A novel kind of covalently bonded GNPs-NH-PANI nanorod arrays modified by Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4/GNPs-NH-PANI) with hierarchical structures was synthesized. The Fe3O4/GNPs-NH-PANI composite shows the maximum absorption of -40.31 dB at a thickness of 2.6 mm, and the corresponding bandwidth with effective attenuation (RL < -10 dB) is up to 9.62 GHz (7.8 5-17.47 GHz), suggesting that this cheap and available absorber is believed to be an optimal choice for the application of microwave attenuation.

AB Coordination polymer (CP) composite is a rapidly developing interdisciplinary research area. In this work, Au@Eu-based CP (Au@EuCP) composite nanoparticles have been prepared via a facile solvothermal method. The Au core is about 20 nm in diameter and the shell thickness is around 40 nm. When excited with 394 nm ultraviolet light, characterized emission of Eu3+ was observed. However, the emission intensity of the Au@EuCP is much lower than that of the EuCP. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) test reveals that the core shell particles are with low cytotoxicity. When excited with 638 nm NIR laser at power density of 0.5 W/cm(2) irradiation for 1 min, it quickly increased to 52.4 degrees C. The core shell particles may found application in bioimaging and photothermal therapy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Up-conversion luminescence of Er3+-doped oxyfluoride germanate optical fiber is observed under laser-diode excitation. The enhanced green emission line is due to H-2(11/2),S-4(3/2) -> I-4(15/2) transition of Er3+. The integrated luminescence intensity related to H-2(11/2),S-4(3/2) -> I-4(15/2) (green) and F-4(9/2) -> I-4(15/2) (red) transitions of Er3+ is reduced with increasing temperature. Several spectroscopic parameters of Er3+ ions in optical fibers were determined. The spectral linewidth is reduced, whereas the maximum of emission peak is shifted to longer wavelengths with increasing fiber length. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper discusses the catalytic feature of apple pectin encapsulated Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4-Pectin) which is prepared by co-precipitation of Fe(II/(III) ions in alkaline solution and supporting copper(II) sulfate. This process led to formation of magnetic nanoparticles within the network of pectin. It was used for immobilization of copper ions for fabrication of a catalyst which could be applicable in the catalysis of regioselective three-component synthesis of triazole through the in situ synthesis of benzyl azide and its 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition with phenyl acetylene.

AB Porous carbon sheets (PCSs) was synthesized via carbonization and activation from epipremnum aureum leaves for their ability to absorb harmful substances. The specific surface area (SSA) was increased to 1076 m(2) g(-1) with pore volume to 0.508 cm(3) g(-1) after KOH activation. As an electrode material for supercapacitors (SCs), PCSs had a high specific capacitance of 243 F g(-1) at the current density of 0.1 A g(-1). PCS-based SCs exhibited excellent electrochemical reversibility and good cycling performance (94.4% after 10,000 cycles). The outstanding capacitive behaviors indicated PCSs had fast ion transfer path, good conductivity and excellent cycling stability, which can be potentially applied in energy storage field.

AB This paper aims at introducing a new type of multifunctional polymer-based composites, which partially act as a primary structural component as well as an energy storage device, potentially for any flying object, like unmanned air vehicles (UAV), and automotive applications. In this study, it was found that a continuous carbon fibre reinforced epoxy composite (CFRP) inserted with a layer of graphene oxide (GO) paper, which is 4 mu m in thickness, exhibited a better capacitance (17.13 mu F/m(2)) as compared with the one fabricated by using a layer of regular printing paper with the thickness of 0.1 mm as a dielectric separator (2.18 mu F/m(2)). The printing specimens were used in this study because of their highest specific capacitance reported in the previous studies. Through the experiments, it is evident that the GO paper is an excellent candidate as dielectric separator for structural dielectric capacitors as well as demonstrates its potential for the development of multifunctional energy storage device embedded in a carbon-based structure.

AB Water soluble fluorescent Ag clusters trapped in the cavity of beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) was synthesized by a facile one-pot procedure at room temperature. It's demonstrated that the glutathione bound to Ag cores penetrates through the cavity of beta-CDs, which acted as the templates and restricted the size of clusters. Fluorescence enhancement was observed in Ag clusters when Al3+ was added. The fluorescence enhancement mechanism was studied. Comparing to interaction between shell ligands and Al3+, it's likely the interaction between Ag cores and Al3+ plays dominant role in this process. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Compressive mechanical response of a Zr-based bulk metallic glass is investigated in the strain rate range of 0.0001/s-9000/s. Negative strain rate dependency of the peak stress is revealed which shows a 30% decrease compared with the static date. Rate dependent melting phenomenon is indicated by measuring the width of vein-like structures on the fracture surface after each compression at different strain rates. The mechanisms of temperature rise localizing in a shear band are explored for analyzing the melting behavior, the reduced viscosity and the resultant stress decrease. The characteristic transition from non-Newtonian to Newtonian flow in the shear bands correlated to the strain rate is addressed. The melting liquid is also involved in the dynamic deformation straining through forming high-density nano-space wrinkle structures for a considerable toughness. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The results showed that field emission performance was strongly affected by nanowire morphology, and the nanotower-like ZnO exhibited the lowest turn-on field of 4.36 V/mu m. The classical F-N theory was employed to analyze the enhancement mechanism. It was found that only the optimized combination of field enhancement factors and geometrical factors could assure excellent field emission performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These microstructural alterations, primarily the growth of NiO inclusions at the Ni vertical bar YSZ interface, the resultant orientation relationship between the NiO and YSZ grains, and Ni grain fragmentation on subsequent reduction, provide a straightforward evidence for the so-called oxygen spillover mechanism of the anodic reaction.

AB Uniform bead-like CuMn2O4/ZnO nanofibers were successfully fabricated via a facile electrospinning technology. The current new findings can be emphasized on the introduction of ZIF-8 into Cu-based precursor solution that had a great significance for controlling phase structure and morphology of CuMn2O4/ZnO composites. Compared with hollow CuMn2O4 nanofibers and CuMn2O4/ZnMn2O4 irregular rod-like materials, CuMn2O4/ZnO nanofibers can display the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of 86% as the irradiation time increasing to 50 min and the good photocatalytic cycle stability to methylene blue (MB). The influence of adding amount of ZIF-8 on the morphological evolution and photocatalytic property of CuMn2O4/ZnO nanofibers and the relevant photocatalytic mechanism were investigated. The synthesis approach of CuMn2O4/ZnO nanofibers is expected for fabricating other 1D semiconductor composites with novel morphologies and advanced properties in photocatalysis, gas sensing, and electrochemical applications.

AB In this work, the hybrids of Ni-Co nanoheterostructure wrapped by carbon with high specific surface areas and narrow mesopores distribution were obtained by one-step heat treatment of nickelocene (NiCp2) filled ZIF-67. This is a fine example of the integration of metal heterostructure and porous carbon in one particle at the nanometer level. Electrochemical data demonstrate that this nanoporous hybrid material integrates the advantageous properties of the transition metal and carbon, exhibiting a distinguished specific capacitance (236 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1)) and a higher cycling stability of 94.3% after 1000 cycles, highlighting the advantages of such unique configuration accompanied by the synergistic effect of Ni-Co heterostructure.

AB Ag3VO4/AgI composites with different Ag3VO4/AgI molar ratios were prepared by sequential precipitation. These composites were more active than Ag3VO4 and AgI in photodegradation of aqueous dyes and tetracycline hydrochloride under visible irradiation. Ag3VO4/AgI with an Ag3VO4/AgI molar ratio of 1/20 showed the highest photocatalytic activity and good recyclability. The improved photocatalytic activity of Ag3VO4/AgI can be attributed to the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. A possible photocatalytic mechanism is proposed.

AB Phase change material (PCM) is a new kind of material for energy storage; its thermal properties are key factors in determining the application areas and the actual effect. The polyethylene glycol (PEG)/expanded graphite (EG) composite was prepared as a novel form-stable PCM by vacuum impregnation in this study. Nitrogen adsorption test indicated that EG belonged to materials in mesoporous scale with developed porous structure and prodigious adsorbility. The PEG/EG PCM owned excellent sealing performance and remarkable thermal storage capacity. The phase change temperatures and latent heats of the PEG/EG PCM were in range of 18.89-25.93 degrees C and 97.56-98.59 J.g(-1) respectively. TGA and thermal performance manifested that the PEG/EG PCM presented good thermal stability and EG performed favorable conductivity and improved the thermal storage efficiency. The obtained PCMs were suitable for indoor energy saving and thermal comfort improvement. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID WETTABILITY; SOLDER
AB This letter presents a method and its mechanism of using Ag coating to inhibit rebound of Al droplets over soluble substrates. Experiments show that Ag coating can eliminate droplet rebound, which makes it possible to print complex parts with high-quality inner surface. Further investigation reveals that Ag coating suppresses the rebound of Al droplets through strong chemical interaction between liquid Al and Ag layer, which results in fast Ag dissolution in liquid Al and formation of a dendritic network of Al-Ag intermetallic compounds (IMCs) on their interface. XRD and EDS observation indicates that the IMCs caused by Ag atom diffusion and precipitation are mainly composed of Ag2Al intermetallics and alpha-Al solid solutions. It is found that the thickness of the IMCs layer increases as the substrate temperature is raised. The temperature increase of the substrate will slow down the droplet cooling process, which allows more thorough chemical reaction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNT) were grown by anodization on Ti foils in ethylene glycol electrolyte. After electrochemical reduction and calcination under nitrogen process, Ti3+ and interstitial N in the lattice were found by XPS and Raman test. The co-doped black TNT sample yielded a high photocurrent density of 2.54 mA.cm(-2) without bias voltage, while pure TNT has photocurrent density of 0.38 mA.cm(-2), it is much higher than ever reported black TiO2. The electron transport resistances decreased from 594.8 ohm.cm(-2) to 274.3 ohm.cm(-2) and the carrier density increased from 1.35 x 1022 cm(-3) to 6.68 x 1022 cm(-3) after N, Ti3+ co-doped. Valence-band XPS spectra and Mott-Schottky plot indicated that presence of interstitial N, Ti3+ state in the lattices can reduce the energy gap from 3.2 eV to about 2.0 eV. In addition, TNT cathodic polarization in 0.1 M NaH2PO4 has better photoelectrochemical properties than that in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The obtained MoS2/rGO-MOF hybrid catalyst exhibits an excellent electrocatalytic HER activity with small onset overpotential of 60 mV and a low Tafel slope of 36 mV decade(-1). The enhancement of catalytic activities was ascribed to the higher specific surface area beneficial from the mesoporous structure of GO-MOF hybrid and synergetic effect between MoS2 nanosheets and GO-MOF matrix.

AB Ultrathin two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have shown significant potential for diverse applications in semiconductor industry. The controlled synthesis of TMDCs is a prerequisite for its potential application. Unfortunately, controllable synthesis is still a great challenge. Here, we report an experimental method to induce a broad range of morphologies in highly crystalline, monolayer MoSe2 thin films by H-2 content engineering. A growth mechanism was proposed to clarify the formation process for variable-shaped MoSe2 crystals. We attributed the evolution in morphologies to a result of the variable growth rates of two types of terminations that occur under different growth conditions. Our work provides a foundation for the controlled synthesis of MoSe2, reveals the shape evolution of CVD-derived MoSe2 and broadens the application range based on its shape-dependent properties.

The electrochemical etching process was conducted at 900 degrees C and 3.2 V. The results show that the obtained product is porous SiC-CDC nanospheres, which contain amorphous carbon and a small amount of ordered graphite phase. The specific surface area of the produced SiC-CDC was determined to be 881 m(2)/g. The specific capacitance of the SiC-CDC is 176 F/g and possesses excellent cycling stability (97.8% retention of the initial capacitance after 1000 cycles) at a current density of 1000 mA/g.

AB In this paper, we develop a new type of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based nanocomposite by incorporating carboxyl-functionalized multi-walled nanotube (MWCNT) to the polymer matrix as fillers. The dispersion of MWCNT during the material processing plays a significant role in deciding the final properties of the nanocomposites. A rapid evaporation and stirring method was used to minimize re-aggregation of the fillers during MWCNT/PDMS composites fabrication processing by solution blending. Furthermore, dispersions of MWCNT in solvents were investigated to correlate the degree of dispersion state with Hansen solubility parameters. The result indicated that carboxyl group can impart negative charges and create the long-term electrostatic stability of MWCNT in the solvents. The resultant MWCNT/PDMS composites exhibited high permittivity, low dielectric loss, and low percolation threshold. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Electrochemical Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (E-SERS) can effectively enhance the Raman signal intensities. However, the complex appliance and operation conditions hampered its application in quick and on-site detection. To solve this problem, a SERS substrate consisting of solar cell film and Au nanoparticles was prepared. The solar cell provides electrical potential by the laser irradiation to take place of electrochemical workstation which is essential in conventional E-SERS. The Au nanoparticles were loaded on the surface of solar cell film to provide electromagnetic enhancement. The sensitivity of the Raman signals on solar cell film-Au (SCAu) SERS substrate has been demonstrated to increase up to 6.7 times compared with that on the bare Au nanoparticles. Various molecules tests demonstrated the widespread prospect of the SCAu substrate in micro chemical detection. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A facile low-temperature synthesis process, including the first electrodeposition and the second hydrothermal reaction, has been adopted in fabricating the Li-Mn-O thin-film probe to measure the localized electrochemical impedance of the solid-state electrolyte LiPON. The synthesized thin film is uniformly and densely deposited on the probe, which is composed of layered Li2MnO3 and LiMnO2 crystalline phases. In addition to surface topography mapping, using the thin-film probe allows us to discern the dominant charge transfer resistance at the LiPON/Li-Mn-O interface from the electrolyte resistance in nanoscale level, which is different from the results obtained by a conductive probe as well as a MIM cell. It is also found by the thin-film probe that the ion transport in LiPON and charge transfer behavior at the LiPON/Li-Mn-O interface can be facilitated by introducing an external voltage.

AB Two pyrene derivatives, substituted with 2-methylnaphthalene units on 1,3-position and 1,6-position of pyrene backbones, were designed and synthesized. OFT calculation confirmed that the two molecules were highly twisted and the dihedral angles between pyrene backbone and naphthalene unit were over 80 degrees, being attributed to the steric hindrance of ortho-methyl group and the substitution position of pyrene itself. As a result, the intermolecular aggregation was greatly inhibited in the solid state, being beneficial for suppressing the fluorescence quenching. By analyzing the optical and thermal properties, it was found that the pi-pi conjugation extension could be adjusted and a balance for high fluorescent efficiency and avoiding quenching at the same time could be reached, which may guide the molecular design in the future. The electroluminescence properties of the non-doped devices were enhanced with the double hole-transporting layers by optimizing the energy level matching. The stable blue EL emission, with the Commission Internationaled'Eclairage (CIEx,y) color coordinates of (0.15, 0.13) and (0.15, 0.11) at 7, 8, 9 and 10 V respectively, was obtained.

AB Cu2-xSe quantum dots (QDs) were synthesized by organometallic synthesis methods. Due to heavy self doping, the Cu2-xSe QDs exhibit particle plasmon resonance in the near-infrared. Transient absorption spectroscopic investigation revealed strong nonlinear optical absorption and bleaching performance of the QDs under femtosecond pulse excitation, which enabled the Cu2-xSe QDs to be excellent saturable absorbers and applied in Q-switched or mode-locked lasers. A passively Q-switched Yb3+:YAG solid-state laser at 1.03 mu m was achieved by coating Cu2-xSe QDs as saturable absorbers onto one of the output coupler of the V-shaped linear cavity.

AB The electronic refractive index variation is associated with the difference in the polarizabilities (Delta alpha(p)) of the Cr3+ ion in its ground and excited states. In order to further address the physical origin of Amp in a Cr3+-doped YAG crystal, time-resolved Z-scan measurements were performed and analyzed at lambda = 457 nm by using a chopped Ar+ ion laser. It is found a nonlinear refractive index with the real and imaginary parts n(2)' = 2.2 x 10(-8) cm(2)/W and n(2)" = 2.8 x 10(-1)0 cm(2)/W, respectively. The real part is associated with a polarizability difference Delta alpha(p) = 2.2 x 10(-25) cm(3). The imaginary part indicates that excited state absorption (ESA) occurs and that Cr:YAG behaves as a saturable absorber. The transient response of the Z-scan signal decreases with the laser intensity as tau(-1)= tau(-1)(0)(1+I/Is), where To is the excited state lifetime and I-s the saturation intensity. By measuring this transient response at different laser intensities, it was possible to confirm the tau(0) value which can be derived from fluorescence measurements and to determine a Is value of 8.3 kW/cm(2).

AB The effect of thickness have been investigated on the optical properties of InAlAs/GaAlAs quantum dots (QDs). The photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) have been studied on temperature dependences. A sudden decrease in the PL energy emission with increasing InAlAs thickness indicates that the optical emission comes from the wetting layer to QDs, while the full width at half maximum (FWHM) abruptly increases due to the efficient relaxation process. The density of InAlAs QDs decreases as the InAlAs thickness increases from 4.2 to 6.4 monolayers (ML). With increasing excitation power, the QD emission energy was red-shifted for the highest ML, attributed to the carrier trapping. A strong decrease in the exciton lifetime with increasing ML has been observed on temperature dependence induced by the QD zero-dimensional confinement. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The synthesized N-CDs were characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), UV Visible spectroscopy (UV Vis), fluorescence spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The average size of the N-CDs was approximately 3.59 nm and the calculated inter layer distance was found to be 0.21 nm. Raman spectroscopy and SAED pattern revealed the graphitic nature of the synthesized N-CDs. The N-CDs were found to emit intense blue color at 405 nm under the excitation of 315 nm. The doping of nitrogen over the surface of the N-CDs was confirmed by EDS, FT-IR and XPS studies. The synthesized N-CDs were found to exhibit excellent catalytic activity in the reduction of Rhodamine-B using sodium borohydrate. The MIT assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity and biocompatibility of N-CDs towards L-929 and MCF-7 cells. From the results obtained, it was found that the N-CDs exhibit low cytotoxicity and superior biocompatibility on both L-929 and MCF-7 cells. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper the effects of size, hydrostatic pressure and temperature on electromagnetically induced transparency, as well as on absorption and the dispersion properties of multilayered spherical quantum dot with hydrogenic impurity are theoretically investigated. Energy eigenvalues and wavefunctions of quantum systems in three-level and four-level configurations are calculated using the shooting method, while optical properties are obtained using the density matrix formalism and master equations. It is shown that peaks of the optical properties experience a blue-shift with increasing hydrostatic pressure and red-shift with increasing temperature. The changes of optical properties as a consequence of changes in barrier wells widths are non-monotonic, and these changes are discussed in detail. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work demonstrated red light emitting nano-PVP fibers that incorporated with novel three-layer nanostructure of Ag@Si-2@Eu(tta)(3)phen nanoparticles (Ag@SiO2@Eu(tta)(3)phen-NPs), and the hybrid nano-PVP fibers were fabricated via a remarkably simple electrostatic spinning method. For Ag@SiO2@Eu(tta)(3)phen-NPs, the thickness of SiO2 is optimized to obtain the maximum luminescent intensity, as results, the optimized thickness of SiO2 is 20 nm. And the corresponding luminescent intensity (612 nm) of the Ag@SiO2@Eu(tta)(3)phen-NPs is enhanced up to 10 times compared with the pure Eu(tta)(3)phen complex, which indicates that with 20 nm SiO2 thickness, the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of Ag@SiO2 exhibits highest performance for enhancing luminescence. Moreover, the luminescent PVP fibers emit bright red light under the fluorescence microscope, which definitely confirms that the microenvironment provided by PVP polymer is absolutely suitable for the fluorescent composites.

AB In this paper, we investigate electrochemical luminescent (ECL) device with a new structure and the ECL cell device with proposed electrode configuration works reliably at AC voltage. In particular, the conventional ECL cell has counter electrodes in which a cathode and an anode are opposed to each other, whereas the proposed structure has parallel electrodes in which a cathode and an anode are arranged on a single substrate. The proposed electrode configuration has a structural feature that electric short-circuiting is less likely to occur during bending than the conventional electrode configuration. The electro-optical characteristics of the new electrode configuration such as the current density, the light emission intensity, and the time evolution of the emission are investigated. The proposed ECL device exhibited higher light emitting efficiency than the conventional structure. Especially, at AC operation mode, the new structure showed the distinctive luminescence characteristic which is combined the first luminescence near the surface of electrode with the delayed second luminescence near the center of between electrodes. It was closely related to the behavior of luminescent particles. The proposed the ECL cell structure is expected to be utilized as a flexible display device by taking advantage of its characteristics and practicality. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB (Y0.99Eu0.01)(2)O-3 nanoceramics have been produced by sintering of stable cubic nanopowders under 8 GPa at temperature in the range of 25-500 degrees C with the use of Low Temperature High Pressure (LTHP) technique. During consolidation step irreversible phase transition from cubic to monoclinic yttria occurs resulting in two-phase nanoceramics with a grain size in the 10-40 nm range. It has been demonstrated that composite nanoceramics possess a high transmittance in the visible and mid IR ranges due to small light scattering on the nanoscale pores and low birefringence due to extremely small grain size.
   It has been shown that Eu3+ ions act as a luminescent probe in composite (Y0.99Eu0.01)(2)O-3 nano-ceramics since their 4f-4f luminescence strongly depends on the crystallographic environment. The luminescence spectra excited in the charge transfer band (CTB) are presented by superposition of emission from europium ions in cubic and monoclinic yttria. A new wide emission band of (Y0.99Eu0.01)(2)O-3 ceramics in the lambda = 500-650 nm wavelengths range (lambda(ex). = 307 nm) were attributed to luminescence of Eu3+ ions located in perturbed sites at grain boundaries or interfaces.

AB In this paper, chalcogenide glasses of 80GeS(2)-(20-x)Ga2S3-xLa(2)S(3) (x = 0, 1, 3, 5 mol%) were synthesized through the traditional melt-quenching technique. The effects of La2S3 addition on the thermal, optical, and structural properties of Ge-Ga-S glasses were investigated. Results showed that the synthesized glasses possessed considerably high glass transition temperature, improved glass forming ability, high refractive index, and excellent infrared transmittance. A redshift at the visible absorbing cut-off edge lower than 500 nm was observed with increasing of La2S3 content. Direct and indirect optical band gap values were calculated. SEM result suggested that this glass system owned better glass forming ability and uniformity. Raman spectral analysis indicated that the introduction of La2S3 induced the dissociation of Ge-Ge metal bonds and transformed the [S3Ge-GeS3] structure to GeS4 tetrahedrons. Consequently, the connectivity between tetrahedrons of the vitreous network was enhanced. This work suggests that La2S3 modified Ge-Ga-La-S glass is a promising material for infrared optical research. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Surfactant-free, ultrasound assisted modified successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (M-SILAR) method and home-made microcontroller based low-cost potentiostat system are employed to prepare zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructure based thin films. The comparison between physicochemical as well as photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of the nanostructures prepared via two different template free, simplistic and cost-effective green routes have been discussed in detail. X-ray diffraction and Raman analysis confirm the formation of phase pure ZnO with the hexagonal crystal structure. Surface morphology significantly affects the physicochemical as well as PEC properties of ZnO thin films. Nanorods (NRs) and nanosheets (NSs) based ZnO thin films sensitized with N3 dye have been directly used as photoelectrodes in the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.59% is achieved with J(SC) of 4.04 mA/cm(2) and V-OC of 0.44 V for the DSSC in which the M-SILAR deposited 1-D ZnO NRs based thin film is used as the photoanode. While relatively less PCE of 0.29% with J(SC) of 253 mA/cm(2) and V-OC of 036 V is obtained for DSSC prepared using electrodeposited 2-D ZnO NSs. In the NSs like 2-D surface morphology, the presence of multiple grain boundaries are acted as traps for the diffusing electrons, which reduces the electron mobility through it.

AB Highly transparent terbium aluminum garnet (Tb3Al5O12, TAG) magneto-optical ceramics were fabricated from co-precipitated nanopowders with tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as sintering aid by vacuum sintering combined with hot isostatic pressing (HIP) post-treatment. The ball milled TAG powder shows better dispersity than the as-synthesized powder, and its average particle size is about 80 nm.

AB Over the last two decades, silk fibroin has been exploited as a versatile optical material in biological applications due to a combination of unique properties. Recently, protocols have been developed to produce a silk fibroin negative tone resist that is UV crosslinkable, thereby allowing micro and nanoscale patterning of the protein using traditional photolithographic tools. The same protocol has been applied to the silk protein sericin to develop a sericin resist. Despite the immense potential of these biomaterials to develop micro optical patterns on silicon and glass surfaces, as well as self-standing components, their refractive indexes are not well characterized. In this work, optimizing a method to obtain extremely smooth, thin films, the refractive index (RI) of fibroin and sericin proteins and resists were characterized using ellipsometry. The parameters of the Sellmeier and Cauchy dispersion laws have been determined to obtain the RI over a large wavelength range. A complete morphological study of the films has been conducted. In addition, the effect of solvent on the optical properties of silk fibroin and sericin thin films are reported, with differences in values explained by examining the change in the protein secondary structure.

AB We present a generic sol-gel route to the preparation of optically active nanocrystalline holmium-yttrium titanate (Ho0.5Y0.95)(2)Ti2O7 thin films, which exhibit a strong luminescence at 2 mu m. The films were prepared by the sol-gel process and thermally treated in a rapid thermal annealing furnace. The nano crystal size and optical properties were tailored by the processing temperature. The final film thickness was around 500 nm. X-ray diffraction analysis and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the high purity of the crystal phase of (Ho0.05Y0.95)(2)Ti2O7. The activation energy of crystal growth was 35.7 kJ mol(-1). The films had excellent structural and surface homogeneity causing their high transparency close to the theoretical limit of 93.39%. Refractive index of the film heat-treated at 1000 degrees C was around 1.98. The films exhibited strong emission at 2 mu m with a luminescence lifetime around 4.6 ms. Their properties together with processing feasibility make them promising materials for photonic applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID MICROOPTICS; CURVATURE; SYSTEM
AB A simple and efficient technique for fabricating parabolic cylindrical microlens arrays (CMLAs) on the surface of fused silica by shaped femtosecond (fs) laser direct-writing is demonstrated. By means of spatially shaping of a Gaussian fs laser beam to a Bessel distribution, an inversed cylindrical shape laser intensity profile is formed in a specific cross-sectional plane among the shaped optical field. Applying it to experiments, large area close-packed parabolic CMLAs with line-width of 37.5 gm and array size of about 5 x 5 mm are produced. The cross-sectional outline of obtained lenslets has a satisfied parabolic profile and the numerical aperture (NA) of lenslets is more than 0.35. Furthermore, the focusing performance of the fabricated CMLA is also tested in this work and it has been demonstrated that the focusing power of the CMLA with a parabolic profile is better than that with a semi-circular one.

AB The efficiency of graphene-based optoelectronic devices is typically limited by the poor absolute absorption of light. A hybrid structure of monolayer graphene with cylindrical titanium dioxide (TiO2) array and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) spacer layer on aluminum (Al) substrate has been proposed to enhance the absorption for two-dimensional (2D) materials. By combining dielectric array with metal substrate, the structure achieves multiple absorption peaks with near unity absorbance at near-infrared wavelengths due to the resonant effect of dielectric array. Completed monolayer graphene is utilized in the design without any demand of manufacture process to form the periodic patterns. Further analysis indicates that the near-field enhancement induced by surface modes gives rise to the high absorption. This favorable field enhancement and tunability of absorption not only open up new approaches to accelerate the light-graphene interaction, but also show great potential for practical applications in high-performance optoelectronic devices, such as modulators and sensors.

The refractive index, absorption coefficient and transmittance are measured and analyzed. The properties are characterized by several absorption peaks which represent the relevant phonon vibrations modes. The experimental results are in agreement with the theoretical results.

The structure design was performed by changing the number of layer pairs in Bragg mirrors m and the optical thickness of MA defect l(M) to achieve high values of MO characteristics, Theoretical predictions were confirmed by experimental investigation of eight synthesized configurations with m = 4 and m = 7. We have demonstrated the maximum Q = 15.1 deg and F = 7.5% at 624 nm for structure with m = 4 and l(M) = (2.5 center dot lambda(0)/2), where lambda(0) = 690 nm is the photonic band gap center. Configurations with m = 3 can also provide their effectiveness in realization. Maximum MO activity was achieved for configurations with m = 7. The structures with l(M) = (0.8 center dot lambda(0)/2) and l(M) = (2.5 center dot lambda(0)/2) showed respectively the specific Faraday rotation -113 deg/mu m (that exceeds in 62 times the Faraday rotation of MA double layer film) at 654 nm and absolute Faraday rotation -20.6 deg at 626 nm.

AB Many universities have developed large-scale interdisciplinary research centers to address societal challenges and to attract the attention of private philanthropists and federal agencies. However, prior studies have mostly shown that interdisciplinary centers relate to a narrow band of outcomes such as publishing and grants. Therefore, we shift attention to include outcomes that have been the centers mandate to influence - namely outreach to the media and private industry, as well as broader research endeavors and securing external funding. Using data covering Stanford University between 1993 and 2014, we study if being weakly and strongly affiliated with interdisciplinary centers in one year relates to and increases (1) knowledge production (publications, grants and inventions), (2) instruction (numbers of students taught, PhDs and postdocs advised), (3) intellectual prominence (media mentions, awards won and centrality within the larger collaboration network), and (4) the acquisition of various sources of funding in the next year. Our results indicate that interdisciplinary centers select productive faculty and increase their activity on a broad range of outcomes further, and in ways greater than departments and traditional interdisciplinary memberships, such as courtesy and joint appointments.

AB As globalization has expedited mobility of faculty across nations, faculty hiring is taking place at an international level. Institutions and governments often perceive hiring faculty who were trained in different countries as a strategy for reaching the status of world-class universities. The major assumption behind this hiring strategy is that faculty who are educated in prestigious universities in foreign countries will bring cutting edge knowledge and networks that will lead to future research collaborations. Yet, a dearth of research empirically investigated the assumption that institutions that train future foreign faculty and those that hire faculty with foreign degrees will have greater presence in the international networks of research collaboration. Filling this hole, this study examines this assumption from an international perspective, using the case of industrial engineering departments at selective research universities in Chile and Korea. Based on the unique data that document faculty hiring (degree attainment institutions) and research collaboration (co-authorship), and institutional prestige (global ranking positions), we analyzed the relationship between faculty hiring network and research collaboration network, as well as their association with institutional prestige. The results provide strong evidence of the positive relationships between doctoral training and future research collaboration, and the strong presence of institutions with global prestige. These relationships result in homophilic networks that suggest a concern about a reduced diversity in theoretical perspective and research methods within the disciplinary field.

AB Literature on innovation policy reveals little of how relations between government agencies as policymakers evolve. Taking the policy network approach, this paper investigates three mechanisms underlining the evolution of inter-government agency relations in emerging economies - policy agenda, power concentration and heterogeneity dependence, and applies them to the analysis of the evolution of innovation policymaking in China. Operationally, the paper proposes a social network analysis (SNA)-based method to quantitatively study China's innovation policy network, which consists of 463 innovation policy documents formulated by its central government ministries between 1980 and 2011. The findings show that the formal policy network for innovation has been not only sustained through the intervention of policy agendas but also self-organized because of policy network's nature of power concentration and heterogeneity dependence. The presence of such mixed mechanisms in China's innovation policy network's evolution differs from the findings from industrialized countries where self-organization plays a central role. This work advances our theoretical understanding of the evolution of innovation policy network and has implications for innovation policymaking in emerging economies.

AB Research on the use of trademarks by innovating companies is growing. Yet, large research gaps exist in our understanding of the use of trademarks beyond manufacturing and beyond specific service sectors. This study focuses on the creative and cultural industries (CCIs) and argues that these industries represent a salient case to advance research on trademarks. After reviewing the main characteristics of CCIs, a conceptual framework is developed to classify motives to trademark and motives not to trademark for firms in these industries. The paper offers original empirical evidence on the relevance of these motives from survey results on a sample of 486 European firms in five selected CCIs.
   Results from principal component analysis are used to propose a taxonomy of firms with specific attitudes and strategies towards trademarking. All results are discussed in terms of their implications for using trademarks as the basis for novel economic indicators of product variety and innovation.

AB Numerous studies attest to the distinctive performance of intra-industry spin-offs located in agglomerated regions. Besides entrepreneurs' pre-entry experience, both superior hires and regional embeddedness have been suggested as factors contributing to this pattern. We employ linked employer-employee data to assess their relevance in the empirical context of the Portuguese plastic injection molds industry. We find that the longevity of entrants is associated with the number and quality of early employees hired from within the industry, consistent with the importance of embodied knowledge flows. Our findings do not suggest that entrants' centrality in the regional industry network enhances their longevity.

AB Background: Studies on pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) children are lacking. The aims of this study were: (i) to investigate PFTs in GHD pre-pubertal children with respect to Controls, before starting Growth Hormone Therapy (GHT) (T0); (ii) to evaluate changes of PFTs in GHD vs Controls, after 1-year GHT (T1). For both aims the mediation analysis (MA) was applied to evaluate the extent to which the relationship between GHD and PFTs could be ascribed to a height-mediated (indirect) or a GH direct effect.
   Methods: 47 pre-pubertal GHD children (aged 5-14 years) underwent PFTs at T0 and T1. At T0, 47 healthy children matched for age and sex were enrolled as Controls. A MA was performed to assess the relationship between GHD and PFTs and height. Statistical analyses were performed using the statistical software R (https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html). A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.
   Measurements and main results: At T0, PFTs indices were significantly lower in GHD than in Controls. From T0 to T1 a significant improvement was found in PFTs. The percentages of the mediated effect on FVC, FEV1, FEF25-75% and TLC were < 50% at T0, suggesting that the direct effect was prevalent. At T1, the percentages of the mediated effect for spirometry indices were >= 50%, indicating that the indirect (height-mediated) effect was the most relevant.
   Conclusions: The study shows that pre-pubertal children with GHD have an impairment of lung function not exclusively attributable to the indirect (height-mediated) effect, but also to the direct GH action which is mitigated after 1-year of GHT.

AB Background: Little is known about the relationship between bone fragility and respiratory function. We hypothesized that women with osteoporosis or osteopenia, without cardio-pulmonary disease, have perturbations in the pattern of breathing and gas exchange.
   Methods: In 44 women with bone fragility (BF, T score: < -1), and 20 anthropomorphically-matched control women (T score > -1) we compared pulmonary function tests, central respiratory drive (mouth occlusion pressure or P 0.1), pattern of breathing using optoelectronic plethysmograph and arterial blood gases at rest.
   Results: Static pulmonary function was similar in BF subjects and controls. However, the arterial blood gas measurements differed significantly. The arterial pH was significantly higher in BF subjects than in controls (P < 0.001). The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and oxygen (PaO2) in arterial blood were significantly lower in BF subjects than controls (P < 0.001 and P = 0.009, respectively). The BF subjects had a shorter inspiratory fraction compared with controls (P = 0.036). Moreover, T-scores were significantly inversely correlated with the alveolar-arterial gradient of oxygen (r = -0.5; P = 0.0003) and the arterial pH (r = -0.4; P = 0.002), and positively correlated with arterial PaO2 (r = 0.3; P = 0.01) and PaCO2 (r = 0.4; P = 0.002) among all subjects.
   Conclusion: In the absence of known cardio-pulmonary disease, BF is associated with statistically significant perturbations in gas exchange and alterations in the pattern of breathing including shortening of the inspiratory time.

AB Background: Interstitial lung diseases are heterogeneous, and patients with chronic fibrosing interstitial pneumonia (CFIP) often have clinical, serologic, and morphologic features suggestive but not diagnostic of connective tissue disease. Recently, the concept of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) has been proposed as a platform for such patients. However, the prognostic role of IPAF, including the cumulative incidence of acute exacerbations (AEs), is not fully clear. The aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical features and prognostic significance of IPAF.
   Methods: The clinical characteristics and prognostic relevance of a diagnosis of IPAF were retrospectively explored in 194 patients with CFIP, including 163 with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 31 with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), in our interstitial lung disease database.
   Results: Sixteen percent of patients with CFIP (8% of IPF, 61% of NSIP) met the criteria for IPAF. Patients with IPAF were significantly younger and included a higher proportion of women, never-smokers, and patients with NSIP than those without IPAF. The morphologic domain was the most common in patients with IPAF (97%), followed by the serologic domain (72%) and clinical domain (53%). CFIP patients with IPAF had a more favorable prognosis with regard to overall survival (OS; P < 0.001, log-rank test) and incidence of AEs (P = 0.029, Gray's test) than those without IPAF. In the subgroup analysis, NSIP patients with IPAF had significantly better survival than those without IPAF (P = 0.031, log-rank test), and IPF patients with IPAF tended to have better OS than those without IPAF (P = 0.092, log-rank test). However, there were no significant differences in the incidence of AEs between patients with IPAF and those without IPAF in the IPF and NSIP subgroups. Furthermore, fulfilment of the IPAF criteria was an independent predictor of OS (hazard ratio (HR) 0.127; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.017-0.952; P = 0.045) and incidence of AEs (HR 0.225: 95% CI 0.054-0.937; P = 0.040).
   Conclusions: A diagnosis of IPAF might predict a favorable prognosis and less risk of AEs in patients with CFIP.

AB Background: Inadequate sleep duration and insomnia can affect both physical and mental health. There is limited evidence, however, on characteristics and correlates of sleep patterns and insomnia in urban and rural China.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study, involving 512,891 adults aged 30-79 years from ten (five urban and five rural) diverse areas in China, recorded detailed information, using interviewer-administered laptop based questionnaires, on sleep patterns (duration, daytime napping and snoring) and insomnia symptoms. Logistic regression was used to examine the associations of sleep patterns and insomnia symptoms with a range of socio-economic, lifestyle, behaviour and health-related factors.
   Results: Overall, the mean (SD) sleep duration was 7.38 (1.37) h, with 23% reporting short (<6 h) and 16% reporting long (>9 h) sleep duration, 21% taking daytime naps and 22% having frequent snoring. Overall, 17% reported having insomnia symptoms, with a higher proportion in women than in men (19% vs 13%), in rural than in urban residents (19% vs 15%), and in individuals who were living alone (23%). The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of having insomnia symptoms were significantly higher among people with major depressive episodes (6.10, 95% CI: 5.69-6.55), generalised anxiety disorders (7.46, 6.65-8.37) and any chronic diseases (1.46; 1.44-1.49). In contrast, the ORs of insomnia symptoms were significantly lower among those reporting napping (0.77, 0.75-0.78) and frequent snoring (0.86, 0.84-0.87).
   Conclusions: Among Chinese adults, sleep patterns varied greatly by socio-economic, lifestyle and health-related factors. The risk of insomnia symptoms was associated with both poor mental and physical health status. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: To clarify sleep disorder risk factors among student athletes, this study examined the relationship between lifestyle habits, competition activities, psychological distress, and sleep disorders.
   Methods: Student athletes (N = 906; male: 70.1%; average age: 19.1 +/- 0.8 years) in five university sports departments from four Japanese regions were targeted for analysis. Survey items were attributes (age, gender, and body mass index), sleep disorders (recorded through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), lifestyle habits (bedtime, wake-up time, smoking, drinking alcohol, meals, part-time jobs, and use of electronics after lights out), competition activities (activity contents and competition stressors), and psychological distress (recorded through the K6 scale). The relation between lifestyle habits, competition activities, psychological distress, and sleep disorders was explored using logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Results of multivariate logistic regression analysis with attributes as adjustment variables showed that "bedtime," "wake-up time," "psychological distress," "part-time jobs," "smartphone/cellphone use after lights out," "morning practices," and "motivation loss stressors," were risk factors that were independently related to sleep disorders.
   Conclusions: Sleep disorders among student athletes are related to lifestyle habits such as late bedtime, early wake-up time, late night part-time jobs, and use of smartphones/cellphones after lights out; psychological distress; and competition activities such as morning practices and motivation loss stressors related to competition. Therefore, this study suggests the importance of improving these lifestyle habits, mental health, and competition activities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Sleep difficulties are a serious health problem in children, and interest in using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies to treat sleep is growing. In this study, we aimed to identify: the prevalence of sleep difficulties in children, and the prevalence and patterns of CAM use among children with trouble sleeping.
   Methods: We used the 2012 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) dataset to estimate the prevalence of sleep difficulties and CAM use in children ages 6-17 years. Prevalence estimates were weighted to reflect the survey's sampling design. We used logistic regression to explore associations between sleep difficulties, psychosocial factors, comorbidities and CAM use.
   Results: 6.4% of children in the 2012 NHIS dataset reported regular difficulty sleeping in the last year, corresponding to an estimated 1.5 million children in the US. Older age, poorer health status, more missed school days, and multiple comorbidities were all associated with sleep difficulties (p <= 0.001). Among children with sleep difficulties, 29% used at least one CAM therapy. Of the CAM therapies surveyed, non-vitamin, non-mineral supplements were the most commonly used (14.6%), followed by manipulation therapies (9.2%) and mind-body techniques (8.8%). Parental education and CAM use were most strongly associated with child CAM use (p <= 0.001).
   Conclusions: CAM therapies, particularly non-vitamin, non-mineral supplements, are commonly used among children with sleeping problems. More research is needed to characterize the safety and efficacy of CAM therapies for sleep in this population. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Sleepiness and cardiovascular disease share common molecular pathways; thus, metabolic risk factors for sleepiness may also predict cardiovascular disease risk. Daytime sleepiness predicts mortality and cardiovascular disease, although the mechanism is unidentified. This study explored the associations between subjective sleepiness and metabolite concentrations in human blood plasma within the oxidative and inflammatory pathways, in order to identify mechanisms that may contribute to sleepiness and cardiovascular disease risk.
   Methods: An exploratory case control sample of 36 subjects, categorized based on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaire as sleepy (ESS >= 10) or non-sleepy (ESS < 10), was recruited among subjects undergoing an overnight sleep study for suspected sleep apnea at the University of Pennsylvania Sleep Center. The average age was 42.4 +/- 10.5 years, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 40.0 +/- 9.36 kg/m(2), median Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) was 8.2 (IQR: 2.5-26.5), and 52% were male. Fasting morning blood plasma samples were collected after an overnight sleep study. Biomarkers were explored in subjects with sleepiness versus those without using the multiple linear regression adjusting for age, BMI, smoking, Apnea Hypopnea Index (sleep apnea severity), study cohort, and hypertension.
   Results: The level of choline is significantly lower (P = 0.003) in sleepy subjects (N = 18; mean plasma choline concentration of 8.19 +/- 2.62 mu mol/L) compared with non-sleepy subjects (N = 18; mean plasma choline concentration of 9.14 +/- 2.25 mu mol/L). Other markers with suggestive differences (P < 0.1) include isovalerylcarnitine, Alpha-Amino apidipic acid, Spingosine 1 Phosphate, Aspartic Acid, Propionylcarnitine, and Ceramides (fatty acids; C14-C16 and C-18).
   Conclusion: This pilot study is the first to show that lower levels of plasma choline metabolites are associated with sleepiness. Further exploration of choline and other noted metabolites and their associations with sleepiness will guide targeted symptom management. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To evaluate rapid eye movement (REM) muscular activity in narcolepsy by applying five algorithms to electromyogram (EMG) recordings, and to investigate its value for narcolepsy diagnosis.
   Patients/methods: A modified version of phasic EMG metric (mPEM), muscle activity index (MAI), REM atonia index (RAI), supra-threshold REM EMG activity metric (STREAM), and Frandsen method (FR) were calculated from polysomnography recordings of 20 healthy controls, 18 clinic controls (subjects suspected with narcolepsy but finally diagnosed without any sleep abnormality), 16 narcolepsy type one without REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), nine narcolepsy type one with RBD, and 18 narcolepsy type two. Diagnostic value of metrics in differentiating between groups was quantified by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Correlations among the metrics and cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 (CSF-hcrt-1) values were calculated using linear models.
   Results: All metrics excluding STREAM found significantly higher muscular activity in narcolepsy one cases versus controls (p < 0.05). Moreover, RAI showed high sensitivity in the detection of RBD. The mPEM achieved the highest AUC in differentiating healthy controls from narcoleptic subjects. The RAI best differentiated between narcolepsy 1 and 2. Lower CSF-hcrt-1 values correlated with high muscular activity quantified by mPEM, sMAI, IMAI, PEM and FR (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: This automatic analysis showed higher number of muscle activations in narcolepsy 1 compared to controls. This finding might play a supportive role in diagnosing narcolepsy and in discriminating narcolepsy subtypes. Moreover, the negative correlation between CSF-hcrt-1 level and REM muscular activity supported a role for hypocretin in the control of motor tone during REM sleep. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Microcystin LR (MC-LR) is a highly toxic compound and it is known for its adverse health effect on both humans and animals. Due to the ineffectiveness of conventional water treatments methods, for the past decades, researchers have been developing cost-effective ways of removing MC-LR from water bodies. This study reports the application of powdered activated carbon (PAC) obtained from the waste tyre for the removal of MC-LR. The choice of the adsorbent was chosen due to its attractive properties. The prepared tyre-based PAC was found to have the large surface area (1111 m(2) g(-1)). The detection of MC-LR was achieved using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with a PDA detector. The experimental parameters (such as optimum pH, dosage and contact time) affecting the removal of MC-LR using tyre based-powdered activated carbon were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). Maximum removal of MC-LR was achieved under the following optimum conditions; sample pH 4, carbon dosage concentration 10,000 mg L-1 and contact time of 34 min. Under optimum conditions, kinetic studies and adsorption isotherms reflected better fit for pseudo-second-order rate and Langmuir isotherm model, respectively. The optimized method was applied for the removal of MC-LR in waste-water sample. The effluent and influent sample contained initial concentrations ranging from 0.52 to 8.54 mu g L-1 and the removal efficiency was 100%. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmacological effects of bee venom has been reported, however, it has been restricted to the bee venom collected from European honey bee (Apis mellifere). The aim of the present study was to compare the antioxidant activities and irritation properties of venoms collected from four different Apis species in Thailand, which includes Apis cerena (Asian cavity nesting honeybee), Apis florea (dwarf honeybee), Apis dorsata (giant honeybee), and A. mellifera. Melittin content of each bee venom extracts was investigated by using high-performance liquid chromatography. Ferric reducing antioxidant power, 2, 2'-azinobis (3-thylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), and 1, 1-dipheny1-2-picrylhydrazyl assay were used to determine the antioxidant activity, whereas, hen's egg test chorioallantoic membrane assay was used to determine the irritation property of each bee venom extracts. Melittin was the major constituent in all bee venom extracts. The melittin content in A. dorsata, A. mellifera, A. florea, and A. cerena were 95.8 +/- 3.2%, 76.5 +/- 1.9%, 66.3 +/- 8.6%, and 56.8 +/- 1.8%, respectively. Bee venom extract from A. dorsata possessed the highest antioxidant activity with the inhibition of 41.1 +/- 2.2% against DPPH., Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity of 10.21 +/- 0.74 mM Trolox/mg and equivalent concentration (EC1) of 0.35 +/- 0.02 mM FeSO4/mg. Bee venom extract from A. mellifera exhibited the highest irritation, followed by A. cerena, A. dorsata, and A. florea, respectively. Melittin was the compound responsible for the irritation property of bee venom extracts since it could induce severe irritation (irritation score was 13.7 +/- 0.5, at the concentration of 2 mg/ml). The extract from A. dorsata which possessed the highest antioxidant activity showed no irritation up to the concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. Therefore, bee venom extract from A. dorsata at the concentration not more than 0.1 mg/ml would be suggested for using as cosmetic ingredients since it possessed the highest antioxidant activity with no irritation. This study is the first report to compare the bee venom extracts from different Apis species and display their potential application of bee venom extracts in cosmetic products. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The biological pump plays a critical role in the occurrence and fate of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) mostly in temperate and frigid oligotrophic waters. However, the factors for the long-term occurrence and fate of HOCs in subtropical eutrophic waters remain largely unknown. This study provides novel insights into biogeochemical and physical factors on the annual occurrence, bioaccumulation, and biomagnification of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the plankton food webs of four Chinese subtropical eutrophic lakes by one-year simultaneous field observations for five compartments. The annual mean Sigma PAH(16) in the water columns ranged from 359.69 +/- 31.52 ng L-1 to 682.69 +/- 65.41 ng L-1, and increased with the annual mean trophic state index, and phytoplankton biomass of these lakes, but was independent on the proximity of the lakes to urban areas. Biodilution effect played an important role in the occurrence of the PAHs in both phytoplankton and zooplankton. In contrast to previous studies in oligotrophic waters, not only the biological pump but also the equilibrium partitioning and the indirect influence of eutrophication (high pH induced by phytoplankton, and phytoplankton life cycling) modulated the annual occurrence of the PAHs in the water columns of these eutrophic lakes. Biphasic correlations were found between the bioaccumulation factors of the PAHs by plankton and the temperature (n = 97-136, R-2 = 0.06-0.24, p <= .008), and were related to plankton phenology. Bioaccumulation factors by plankton were dependent on the hydrophobicity of the PAHs (n = 16, R-2 = 0.27-031, p <= .023), and decreased with plankton biomass (n = 94-103, R-2 = 0.09-0.27, p <= .010). Trophic transfer of the PAHs from phytoplankton to zooplankton increased with phytoplankton biomass (n = 26, R-2 = 0.27, p = .004), and the temperature (n = 102-135, R-2 = 0.06-0.13, p <= .004), but decreased with lake trophic state index. Biomagnification only occurred during phytoplankton bloom periods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Engineered nanoparticles (NPs) are often doped with other elements to improve their functionality and, at times, physical and/or chemical stability. However, the effect of doping on the environmental implications of NPs is not well-understood. We investigated the colloidal stability and effects of CuO NPs doped with Fe (0-10%). Colloidal stability of the Fe-doped CuO NPs in aqueous media, as determined by critical coagulation concentrations of NaCl, decreased with increased Fe-doping. However, decrease in the overall particle density led to slower sedimentation of Fe-doped CuO NPs than would have been predicted from their aggregation behavior. Fe-doping significantly affected CuO dissolution (p < .001), promoting Cu leaching out from the doped NPs due to increased reactivity at neutral pH and increased surface area with Fe-doping. Fe-doping did not increase the toxicity of CuO to a marine phytoplankton, Isochrysis galbana, despite promoting ionic Cu release. Total suspended Cu was dominated by dissolved Cu complexes in seawater and particulate Cu in freshwater. Based on the abundance of different size fractions analyzed in freshwater, the particles detected in water suspension were mostly (>= 50%) larger than 200 nm in diameter. However, these large-sized particles are mainly composed of aggregated nanosized particles held together by van der Waals attraction. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fouling development in direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) for seawater desalination was evaluated combining in-situ monitoring performed using optical coherence tomography (OCT) together with destructive techniques. The non-invasive monitoring with OCT provided a better understanding of the fouling mechanism by giving an appropriate sampling timing for the membrane autopsy. The on-line monitoring system allowed linking the flux trend with the structure of fouling deposited on the membrane surface. The water vapor flux trend was divided in three phases based on the deposition and formation of different foulants over time. The initial flux decline was due to the deposition of a 50-70 nm porous fouling layer consisting of a mixture of organic compounds and salts. Liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) analysis revealed the abundance of biopolymer in the fouling layer formed at the initial phase. In the second phase, formation of carbonate crystals on the membrane surface was observed but did not affect the flux significantly. In the last phase, the water vapor flux dropped to almost zero due to the deposition of a dense thick layer of sulfate crystals on the membrane surface. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Drinking water treatment plants based on groundwater may suffer from incomplete ammonium removal, which deteriorates drinking water quality and constrains water utilities in the operation of their plants. Ammonium is normally removed through nitrification in biological granular media filters, and recent studies have demonstrated that dosing of copper can stimulate the removal of ammonium. Here, we investigated if copper dosing could generically improve ammonium removal of biofilters, at treatment plants with different characteristics. Copper was dosed at <= 1.5 mu g Cu/L to biofilters at 10 groundwater treatment plants, all of which had displayed several years of incomplete nitrification. Plants exceeded the Danish national water quality standard of 0.05 mg NH4+/L by a factor of 2-12. Within only 2-3 weeks of dosing, ammonium removal rates increased significantly (up to 150%). Nitrification was fully established, with ammonium effluent concentrations of < 0.01 mg NH4+-N/L at most plants, regardless of the differences in raw water chemistry, ammonium loading rates, filter design and operation, or treatment plant configuration. However, for filters without primary filtration, it took longer time to reach complete ammonium removal than for filters receiving prefiltered water, likely due to sorption of copper to iron oxides, at plants without prefiltration. With complete ammonium removal, we subjected two plants to short-term loading rate upshifts, to examine the filters' ability to cope with loading rate variations. After 2 months of dosing and an average loading rate of 1.0 g NH4+-N/m(3) filter material/h, the loading rate was upshifted by 50%. Yet, a filter managed to completely remove all the influent ammonium, showing that with copper dosing the filter had extra capacity to remove ammonium even beyond its normal loading rates. Depth sampling revealed that the ammonium removal rate of the filter's upper 10 cm increased more than 7-fold from 0.67 to 4.90 g NH4+-N/m(3)/h, and that nitrite produced from increased ammonium oxidation was completely oxidized further to nitrate. Hence, no problems with nitrite accumulation or breakthrough occurred. Overall, copper dosing generically enhanced nitrification efficiency and allowed a range of quite different plants to meet water quality standards, even at increased loading rates. The capacity increase is highly relevant in practice, as it makes filters more robust towards sudden ammonium loading rate variations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To assess the potential of pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) as a viral process indicator, its reduction through coagulation-sedimentation (CS) and rapid sand filtration (RSF) were compared with those of Escherichia coli, previously used viral indicators, and norovirus genotype II (NoV GII; enteric virus reference pathogen) in a bench-scale experiment. PMMoV log(10) reductions in CS (1.96 +/- 0.30) and RSF (0.26 +/- 0.38) were similar to those of NoV GII (1.86 +/- 0.61 and 0.28 +/- 0.46). PMMoV, the most abundant viruses in the raw water, was also determined during CS, RSF, and advanced treatment processes at two full-scale drinking water treatment plants under strict turbidity management over a 13-month period. PMMoV was concentrated from large-volume water samples (10-614 L) and quantified by Taqman-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The PMMoV log(10) reduction in CS (2.38 +/- 0.74, n = 13 and 2.63 +/- 0.76, n = 10 each for Plant A and B) and in ozonation (1.91 +/- 1.18, n = 5, Plant A) greatly contributed to the overall log(10) reduction. Our results suggest that PMMoV can act as a useful treatment process indicator of enteric viruses and can be used to monitor the log(10) reduction of individual treatment processes at drinking water treatment plants due to its high and consistent copy numbers in source water.

AB The discovery of denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation (DAMO) has not only improved our understanding of global methane and nitrogen cycles, but also provided new technology options for removal of nitrate from nitrate- contaminated water. Previous studies have demonstrated DAMO organisms could remove nitrate and nitrite from wastewater under strictly anaerobically conditions. In the study, we investigate the feasibility of nitrate removal from groundwater, which contains dissolved oxygen in addition to nitrate. A membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR), inoculated with DAMO co-culture, was capable of treating synthetic groundwater containing highly contaminated nitrate (50 mg N/L and oxygen (7 - 9 mg O-2/L), with a maximum volumetric nitrate removal rate of 45 mg N/L-d. Accumulations of acetate and propionate were observed in some transient periods, indicating the possible involvement of acetate and propionate as intermediates in methane oxidation. The 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed that Candidatus Methylomirabilis, a known bacterial DAMO organism able to couple nitrite reduction with anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), was the dominant population. No archaeal DAMO organisms that are capable of coupling nitrate to AOM were observed, however, considerable amount of denitrifiers were developed in this system. Based on known metabolisms of these microorganisms and a series of batch studies, it was assumed that methane was oxidized into volatile fatty acids (VFAs) under oxygen-limiting conditions, then the generated VFAs served as carbon sources for these heterotrophic denitrifiers to remove nitrate. This study offers a potential technology for nitrate removal from groundwater by DAMO process in MBfR. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Gut microbiota exerts a fundamental role on host physiology, and how extrinsic perturbations influence its composition has been increasingly examined. However, the effect of drinking water on gut microbiota is still poorly understood. In this study, we explored the response of mouse gut bacterial community (fecal and mucosa-adhered) to the ingestion of different types of drinking water. The experimental cohort was divided according to different water sources into four groups of mice that consumed autoclaved tap water (control group), water collected directly from a drinking water treatment plant, tap water, and commercial bottled mineral water. Differences among groups were observed, especially related to control group, which exhibited the smallest intra-group variation, and the largest distance from test groups on the last experimental day. Clinically important taxa, such as Acinetobacter and Staphylococcus, increased in feces of mice that drank tap water and in mucosa-adhered samples of animals from disinfected and tap water groups. Furthermore, statistical analyses showed that both time elapsed between samplings and water type significantly influenced the variation observed in the samples. Our results reveal that drinking water potentially affects gut microbiota composition. Additionally, the increase of typical drinking water clinically relevant and antibiotic resistance-associated bacteria in gut microbiota is a cause of concern. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We investigated transport mechanisms of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) through aquaporin thin-film composite forward osmosis (FO) membrane, and membrane stability under extreme conditions with respect to TrOC rejections. Morphology and surface chemistry of the aquaporin membrane were characterised to identify the incorporation of aquaporin vesicles into membrane active layer. Pore hindrance model was used to estimate aquaporin membrane pore size as well as to describe TrOC transport. TrOC transport mechanisms were revealed by varying concentration and type of draw solutions. Experimental results showed that mechanism of TrOC transport through aquaporin-embedded FO membrane was dominated by solution-diffusion mechanism. Non-ionic TrOC rejections were molecular weight dependent, suggesting steric hindrance mechanisms. On the other hand, ionic TrOC rejections were less sensitive to molecular size, indicating electrostatic interaction. TrOC transport through aquaporin membrane was also subjected to retarded forward diffusion where reverse draw solute flux could hinder the forward diffusion of feed TrOC solutes, reducing their permeation through the FO membrane. Aquaporin membrane stability was demonstrated by either heat treatment or ethanol solvent challenges. Thermal stability of the aquaporin membrane was manifested as a relatively unchanged TrOC rejection before and after the heat treatment challenge test. By contrast, ethanol solvent challenge resulted in a decrease in TrOC rejection, which was evident by the disappearance of the lipid tail of the aquaporin vesicles from infrared spectrum and a notable decrease in the membrane pore size.

AB Having worked with biofilms since the 1970s, I know that they are ubiquitous in nature, of great value in water technology, and scientifically fascinating. Biofilms are naturally able to remove BOD, transform N, generate methane, and biodegrade micropollutants. What I also discovered is that biofilms can do a lot more for us in terms of providing environmental services if we give them a bit of help. Here, I explore how we can use active substrata to enable our biofilm partners to provide particularly challenging environmental services. In particular, I delve into three examples in which an active substratum makes it possible for a biofilm to accomplish a task that otherwise seems impossible. The first example is the delivery of hydrogen gas (H-2) as an electron donor to drive the reduction and detoxification of the rising number of oxidized contaminant: e.g., perchlorate, selenate, chromate, chlorinated solvents, and more. The active substratum is a gas-transfer membrane that delivers H2 directly to the biofilm in a membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR), which makes it possible to deliver a low-solubility gaseous substrate with 100% efficiency. The second example is the biofilm anode of a microbial electrochemical cell (MxC). Here, the anode is the electron acceptor for anode-respiring bacteria, which "liberate" electrons from organic compounds and send them ultimately to a cathode, where we can harvest valuable products or services. The anode's potential is a sensitive tool for managing the microbial ecology and reaction kinetics of the biofilm anode. The third example is intimately coupled photobiocatalysis (ICPB), in which we use photocatalysis to enable the biodegradation of intrinsically recalcitrant organic pollutants. Photocatalysis transforms the recalcitrant organics just enough so that the products are rapidly biodegradable substrates for bacteria in a nearby biofilm. The macroporous substratum, which houses the photocatalyst on its exterior, actively provides donor substrate and protects the biofilm from UV light and free radicals in its interior. These three well-developed topics illustrate how and why an active substratum expands the scope of what biofilms can do to enhance water sustainability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We analyzed a coal tar polluted aquifer of a former gasworks site in Thuringia (Germany) for the presence and function of aromatic compound-degrading bacteria (ACDB) by 16S rRNA Illumina sequencing, bamA clone library sequencing and cultivation attempts. The relative abundance of ACDB was highest close to the source of contamination. Up to 44% of total 16S rRNA sequences were affiliated to ACDB including genera such as Azoarcus, Georgfuchsia, Rhodoferax, Sulfuritalea (all Betaproteobacteria) and Pelotomaculum (Firmicutes). Sequencing of bamA, a functional gene marker for the anaerobic benzoyl-CoA pathway, allowed further insights into electron-accepting processes in the aquifer: bamA sequences of mainly nitrate-reducing Betaproteobacteria were abundant in all groundwater samples, whereas an additional sulfate-reducing and/or fermenting microbial community (Deltaproteobacteria, Firmicutes) was restricted to a highly contaminated, sulfate-depleted groundwater sampling well. By conducting growth experiments with groundwater as inoculum and nitrate as electron acceptor, organisms related to Azoarcus spp. were identified as key players in the degradation of toluene and ethylbenzene. An organism highly related to Georgfuchsia toluolica G5G6 was enriched with p-xylene, a particularly recalcitrant compound. The anaerobic degradation of p-xylene requires a metabolic trait that was not described for members of the genus Georgfuchsia before. In line with this, we were able to identify a putative 4-methylbenzoyl-CoA reductase gene cluster in the respective enrichment culture, which is possibly involved in the anaerobic degradation of p-xylene.

AB Post-anaerobic digestion (PAD) treatment technologies have been suggested for anaerobic digestion (AD) to improve process efficiency and assure hygenization of organic waste. Because AD reduces the amount of organic waste, PAD can be applied to a much smaller volume of waste compared to pre-digestion treatment, thereby improving efficiency. In this study, dewatered digestate cakes from two different AD plants were thermally hydrolyzed and dewatered, and the liquid fraction was recirculated to a semi continuous AD reactor. The thermal hydrolysis was more efficient in relation to methane yields and extent of dewaterability for the cake from a plant treating waste activated sludge, than the cake from a plant treating source separated food waste (SSFW). Temperatures above 165 degrees C yielded the best results. Post-treatment improved volumetric methane yields by 7% and the COD-reduction increased from 68% to 74% in a mesophilic (37 degrees C) semi-continuous system despite lowering the solid retention time (from 17 to 14 days) compared to a conventional system with pre-treatment of feed substrates at 70 degrees C. Results from thermogravimetric analysis showed an expected increase in maximum TS content of dewatered digestate cake from 34% up to 46% for the SSFW digestate cake, and from 17% up to 43% in the sludge digestate cake, after the PAD thermal hydrolysis process (PAD-THP). The increased dewatering alone accounts for a reduction in wet mass of cake leaving the plant of 60% in the case of sludge digestate cake. Additionaly, the increased VS-reduction will contribute to further reduce the mass of wet cake. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bisphenol S (BPS), an alternative product to bisphenol A (BPA), has been the focus of increasing public concern due to its potential endocrine disrupting effect and its adverse effects related to metabolic disorders such as obesity. The detection of its residue in drinking water supply systems suggests that BPS can be chlorinated; however, whether its endocrine disrupting effect can be disrupted by this chlorination remains unclear. In the present study, we identified the byproducts of the reaction of BPS with chlorine and assessed the effect of the main byproducts on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma). BPS was chlorinated in a simulation experiment. The chlorination reaction in this study was chlorine and pH dependent, and the pseudo-first-order reaction rate constant was controlled by the chlorine concentration and pH. The reaction rate at pH 8.5 was 7 times faster than that at pH 6.5. Twenty-two byproducts were putatively identified by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-Q-ToF-MS), and five main byproducts were purified and characterized by H-1 and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The PPAR gamma effects of the byproducts were assayed, revealing a2-to4-fold enhancement in their activities in comparison with the parent compound. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over the last decade, ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV LEDs) have attracted considerable attention as alternative mercury-free UV sources for water treatment purposes. This review is a comprehensive analysis of data reported in recent years (mostly, post 2014) on the application of UV LED-induced advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) to degrade organic pollutants, primarily dyes, phenols, pharmaceuticals, insecticides, estrogens and cyanotoxins, in aqueous media. Heterogeneous TiO2-based photo catalysis in lab grade water using UVA LEDs is the most frequently applied method for treating organic contaminants. The effects of controlled periodic illumination, different TiO2-based nanostructures and reactor types on degradation kinetics and mineralization are discussed. UVB and UVC LEDs have been used for photo-Fenton, photo-Fenton-like and UV/H2O2 treatment of pollutants, primarily, in model aqueous solutions. Notably, UV LED-activated persulfate/peroxymonosulfate processes were capable of providing degradation in DOC-containing waters. Wall-plug efficiency, energy-efficiency of UV LEDs and the energy requirements in terms of Electrical Energy per Order (E-EO) are discussed and compared. Despite the overall high degradation efficiency of the UV LED-based AOPs, practical implementation is still limited and at lab scale. More research on real water matrices at more environmentally relevant concentrations, as well as an estimation of energy requirements providing fluence-based kinetic data are required.

AB Membrane fouling is a recognized obstacle for the application of ultrafiltration (UF) for drinking water treatment. In this study, ultraviolet/persulfate (UV/PS) oxidation was employed as a pretreatment to control membrane fouling caused by natural organic matter (NOM) in surface water. The effects of UV/PS pretreatment on amounts and characteristics of NOM were investigated in terms of dissolved organic carbon, fluorescent spectrum, molecular weight distribution and hydrophobicity. UF membrane fouling during filtration of raw and pre-oxidized water was compared with transmembrane pressure development, and the fouled membranes were further characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results indicate that NOM was considerably degraded and partially mineralized (similar to 58%) by UV/PS pretreatment at a PS dose not exceeding 0.6 mM and a UV irradiation time within 120 min, which was attributed to the generation of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals. The fluorescent compounds in NOM were almost completely degraded (>98%) by the UV/PS pretreatment at a PS dose of 0.4 mM, except for tyrosine-like proteins (similar to 80%). Moreover, UV/PS pretreatment decreased the ratio of macromolecular compounds and increased the hydrophilic fractions, resulting in reduced NOM adhesion to the membrane. Hence, irreversible fouling by NOM was significantly retarded (similar to 75%) by the UV/PS pretreatment due to reduction in NOM, and more importantly by preferential degradation of fluorescent, macromolecular and hydrophobic compounds. Fouling control performance was considerably improved at increased PS doses and extended UV irradiation time. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This research was based on the investigation of a major principle, regarding the effects of NaCl and KH2PO4 concentrations on struvite recovery, with electricity production using magnesium-air fuel cell electrocoagulation, in accordance with the concentration of phosphorous and chloride. The weight ratio of N:P in the synthetic wastewater was in the range of 1.2-21. The concentration of NH4Cl was fixed at 0.277 M (approximately 3888 ppm as NH3-N and 5000 ppm as NH4), while PO4-P was in the range of 0.006-0.1 M. In addition, the concentrations of NaCl as electrolyte were 0, 0.01, and 0.1 M. Phosphate removal increased linearly with the Mg:P ratio, up to approximately 1.1 mol mol(-1), irrespective of the initial concentrations of phosphate and NaCl. The one-to-one reaction as mole ratio between phosphate and the dissolved Mg ions resulted in phosphate removal, with the production of a one-to-one magnesium/phosphate mineral, such as struvite. The average removal rate of phosphorous in experiments without a dose of NaCl was 4.19 mg P cm(-2) h(-1), which was lower than the relative values of 5.35 and 4.77 mg P cm(-2) h(-1), in experiments with 0.01 and 0.1 M NaCl. The dissolution rate of Mg with electro-oxidation determined the rate of phosphorous removal with struvite recovery. The average removal rates of phosphorous with dose concentrations of 0.006, 0.01 and 0.02 M KH2PO4 were 4.02, 5.54, 6.9 mg P cm(-2) h(-1), respectively, which increased with the increase in KH2PO4 dose. However, in experiments with a dose of 0.05 and 0.1 M KH2PO4, the average removal rates of phosphorous decreased to 4.84 and 2.51, respectively. The maximum power densities in the electrolyte mixture of 0.05 M KH2PO4/0.277 M NH4Cl, 0.01 M NaCl/0.05 M KH2PO4/0.277 M NH4Cl, and 0.1 NaCl/0.05 KH2PO4/0.277 M NH4Cl were 25.1, 26.4, and 33.2 W/m(2), respectively. The increase in the NaCl dose concentration resulted in an increase in the maximum power density and current density. A dose above 0.05 M KH2PO4 resulted in the decrease of the maximum power densities. However, when the dose was below 0.05 M KH2PO4, the maximum power density increased with the increase in KH2PO4 dose. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on the meso-scale physical structure and hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms during gravity driven membrane (GDM) filtration was investigated. Biofilms were developed on the surface of ultrafiltration membranes during dead-end filtration at ultra low pressure (70 mbar). Biofilm EPS composition (total protein, polysaccharide and eDNA) was manipulated by growing biofilms under contrasting nutrient conditions. Nutrient conditions consisted of (i) a nutrient enriched condition with a nutrient ratio of 100:30:10 (C: N: P), (ii) a phosphorus limitation (C: N: P ratio: 100:30:0), and (iii) a nitrogen limitation (C: N: P ratio: 100:0:10). The structure of the biofilm was characterised at meso-scale using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). Biofilm composition was analysed with respect to total organic carbon, total cellular mass and extracellular concentrations of proteins, polysaccharides, and eDNA. 2D-confocal Raman mapping was used to characterise the functional group composition and micro-scale distribution of the biofilms EPS. Our study reveals that the composition of the EPS matrix can determine the meso-scale physical structure of membrane biofilms and in turn its hydraulic resistance. Biofilms grown under P limiting conditions were characterised by dense and homogeneous physical structures with high concentrations of polysaccharides and eDNA. Biofilm grown under nutrient enriched or N limiting conditions were characterised by heterogeneous physical structures with lower concentrations of polysaccharides and eDNA. For P limiting biofilms, 2D-confocal Raman microscopy revealed a homogeneous spatial distribution of anionic functional groups in homogeneous biofilm structures with higher polysaccharide and eDNA concentrations. This study links EPS composition, physical structure and hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms, with practical relevance for the hydraulic performances of GDM ultrafiltration.

AB Investigations involving human faeces and faecal sludge are of great importance for urban sanitation, such as operation and maintenance of sewer systems, or implementation of faecal sludge management. However, working with real faecal matter is difficult as it not only involves working with a pathogenic, malodorous material but also individual faeces and faecal sludge samples are highly variable, making it difficult to execute repeatable experiments. Synthetic faeces and faecal sludge can provide consistently reproducible substrate and alleviate these challenges. A critical literature review of simulants developed for various wastewater and faecal sludge related research is provided. Most individual studies sought to develop a simulant representative of specific physical, chemical, or thermal properties depending on their research objectives. Based on the review, a suitable simulant can be chosen and used or further developed according to the research needs. As an example, the authors present such a modification for the development of a simulant that can be used for investigating the motion (movement, settling and sedimentation) of faeces and their physical and biological disintegration in sewers and in on-site sanitation systems.

AB The presence of antibiotics in water bodies has received increasing attention since they are continuously introduced and detected in the environment and may cause unpredictable environmental hazards and risks. The photocatalytic degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) by ZnO in the presence of fluoride ions (F-ZnO) was evaluated. The effects of operating parameters on the efficiency of SMX removal were investigated by using response surface methodology (RSM). Under the optimum condition, i.e. photo catalyst dosage = 1.48 g/L, pH 4.7, airflow rate = 2.5 L/min and the concentration of fluoride ions = 2.505 mM, about 97% SMX removal was achieved by F-ZnO after 30 min of reaction. The mechanism of reactions, COD removal efficiency and reaction kinetics were also investigated under optimum operating conditions. In addition, about 85% COD reduction was obtained after 90 min photocatalytic reaction. The pseudo-first-order kinetics rate constants for the photodegradation of SMX were found to be 0.099, 0.058 and 0.048 min(-1) by F-ZnO, ZnO and TiO2 (P25), respectively. The figure-of-merit electrical energy per order (E-EO) was used for estimating the electrical energy efficiency, which was shown to be considerably lower than the energy consumption for the reported research on removal of SMX by photocatalytic degradation under UV irradiation. Toxicity assays were conducted by measuring the inhibition percentage (PI) towards E. coil bacteria strain and by agar well diffusion method. The results showed that after 30 min of reaction, the toxicity of the treated solutions by all photocatalysts fell within the non-toxic range; however, the reduction in toxicity by F-ZnO was faster than those by ZnO and P25. Despite the positive effects of surface fluorination of ZnO on the SMX and COD removal and reaction kinetics, its lower stability compared to ZnO and P25 in the repeated experiments gave rise to some doubts about its performance from a practical point of view.

AB To reduce intra-plant nutrient cycling, and recover phosphorus (P) fertilizers from nutrient-rich side streams, wastewater utilities increasingly elect to employ struvite precipitation processes without a clear understanding of the inherent tradeoffs associated with specific design and operating decisions. Specifically, the impact of reactor conditions on struvite crystallization rate, and distribution between formation of fines particles and secondary growth onto large diameter seed crystals represent critical knowledge gaps limiting the predictive capabilities of existing process models. In this work, the relative impacts of initial supersaturation (Si), and seed loading, on P removal kinetics, and struvite solids distribution were investigated. In experiments conducted at different levels of initial supersaturation (1.7 -2.4) and seed loading (0-25 g L-1), struvite fines represented the majority of phosphate solids formed in 10 of 12 conditions. While total P removal was dependent on Si, and primarily attributed to formation of fines, the concentration of struvite seed granules had a significant impact on the rate of P removal. Struvite seed granules increased the rate of precipitation by reducing induction time of primary nucleation of struvite fines. Secondary crystal growth represented the majority of struvite solids formed at high seed loading and low Si, but presented the tradeoff of low total removal and low rate of removal. To convey the significance of these findings on process modeling, we show how a prominent kinetic model with a first-order dependency on solid struvite concentration over-predicts P removal rate when total mass is dominated by large diameter seeds (0.9 mm). This works reveals the critical role of struvite fines in P removal, and highlights the need to account for their production and kinetic importance in struvite process design and operation.

AB Thermal and hydrothermal treatments are promising techniques for sewage sludge management that can potentially facilitate safe waste disposal, energy recovery, and nutrient recovery/recycling. Content and speciation of heavy metals in the treatment products affect the potential environmental risks upon sludge disposal and/or application of the treatment products. Therefore, it is important to study the speciation transformation of heavy metals and the effects of treatment conditions. By combining synchrotron X-ray spectroscopy/microscopy analysis and sequential chemical extraction, this study systematically characterized the speciation of Zn and Cu in municipal sewage sludges and their chars derived from pyrolysis (a representative thermal treatment technique) and hydrothermal carbonization (HTC; a representative hydrothermal treatment technique). Spectroscopy analysis revealed enhanced sulfidation of Zn and Cu by anaerobic digestion and HTC treatments, as compared to desulfidation by pyrolysis. Overall, changes in the chemical speciation and matrix properties led to reduced mobility of Zn and Cu in the treatment products. These results provide insights into the reaction mechanisms during pyrolysis and HTC treatments of sludges and can help evaluate the environmental/health risks associated with the metals in the treatment products.

AB Overall apparent reaction rates for the removal of monochloramine (MCA) in granular activated carbon (GAC) beds were determined using a fixed-bed reactor system and under conditions typical for swimming pool water treatment. Reaction rates dropped and quasi-stationary conditions were reached quickly. Diffusional mass transport in the pores was shown to be limiting the overall reaction rate. This was reflected consistently in the Thiele modulus, in the effect of temperature, pore size distribution and of grain size on the reaction rates. Pores <2.5 times the diameter of the monochloramine molecule were shown to be barely accessible for the monochloramine conversion reaction. GACs with a significant proportion of large mesopores were found to have the highest overall reactivity for monochloramine removal. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Capacitive deionization (CDI) for water treatment, which relies on the capture of charged species to sustain the electrical double layers (EDLs) established within porous electrodes under an applied electrical potential, can be enhanced by the chemical attachment of fixed charged groups to the porous electrode electrodes (ECDI). It has recently been demonstrated that further improvements in capacity and energy storage can be gained by functionalization of the electrode surfaces with redox polymers in which the charge on the electrodes can be modulated through Faradaic reactions under different cell voltages in a capacitive process that can be called "Faradaic CDI" (FaCDI). Here, we extend recent mathematical models developed for the characterization of CDI and ECDI systems to incorporate the redox mediated contributions by allowing for the variable chemical charges generated by reactions in FaCDI. The lumped model developed here assumes the spacer channel is well-mixed with uniform electrosorption in each electrode. We demonstrate that the salt adsorption performance characterization of the fixed chemical charge ECDI and variable chemical charge FaCDI materials can be unified within a common theoretical framework based on the point of zero charge (PZC) of the electrode material. In the latter case the PZC is determined by the equilibrium potentials of the redox couples immobilized on the porous electrodes. The new model is able to predict the experimentally observed enhanced and inverted performance of CDI cells, and illuminates the benefit of choosing redox active materials for water treatment applications. The deionization performance of FaCDI cells is shown to be superior to that of CDI and ECDI systems with equilibrium adsorption capacities 50-100% higher than attained with CDI systems, and at smaller cell voltages, depending on the redox potentials of the Faradaic moieties.

AB The cyanotoxins released into waters during cyanobacterial blooms can pose serious hazards to humans and animals. Apart from their toxicological mechanisms, cyanotoxins have been shown to be involved in estrogenic activity by in vivo and in vitro assays; however, there is limited information on the change in estrogenicity of cyanotoxins following chemical oxidation. In this study, the estrogenic activity of cylindrospermopsin (CYL) and anatoxin-a (ANA) at concentrations ranging from 2.4 x 10(-7) M to 2.4 x 10(-12) M (CYL) and 7.1 x 10(-6) M to 7.1 x 10(-11) M (ANA), and after treatment by the Fe-III-B*/H2O2 catalyst system, was investigated by the yeast estrogen screen (YES) assay. The results indicate that CYL and ANA acted as agonists in the YES assay (CYL logEC(50) = -8.901; ANA logEC(50) = -6.789), their binding affinity to estrogen receptors is associated with their intrinsic properties, including ring structures and toxicant properties. CYL and ANA were shown to simulate endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) to modulate the 17 beta-estradiol-induced estrogenic activity, resulting in non-monotonic dose responses. The treated CYL showed a significantly altered estrogenicity compared to the untreated CYL (T-(2) = 8.168, p <=.05), while the estrogenicity of the treated ANA was not significantly different to the untreated ANA (T-(2) = 1.295, p>.05). Intermediate products generated from CYL and ANA oxidized by Fe-III-B*/H2O2 were identified using Q-Exactive Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Treatment with Fe-III-B*/H2O2 yielded open-ring by-products which likely resulted in CYL's reduced binding affinity to estrogen receptors. The insignificant change in the estrogenicity of treated ANA was possibly a result of its multiple ring structure products, which were likely able to bind to estrogen receptors. The comparisons for the estrogenicity of these cyanotoxins before and after Fe-III-B*/H2O2 treatment suggest that the reductions in estrogenicity achieved by oxidation were dependent on the levels of cyanotoxins removed, as well as the estrogenicity of the degradation products. This is the first study on the change in the estrogenicity of CYL and ANA upon oxidation by Fe-III-B*/H2O2, a high activity catalyst system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The role of natural organic matter (NOM) in contaminants removal by photolysis and photocatalysis has aroused increasing interest. However, evaluation of the influence of NOM characteristics on the transformation products (TPs) formation and transformation pathways of contaminants has rarely been performed. This study investigated the decomposition kinetics, mineralization, TPs formation and transformation pathways of antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) during photolysis and photocatalysis in the presence of three commercial NOM isolates (Sigma-Aldrich humic acid (SAHA), Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) and Suwannee River NOM (SRNOM)) by using UVA light emitting diode (UVA/LED) as an alternative light source. NOM isolates insignificantly affected CIP photolysis but strongly inhibited CIP photocatalysis due to competitive radical quenching. The inhibitory effect followed the order of SAHA (49.6%) > SRHA (29.9%) > SRNOM (21.2%), consistent with their center dot OH quenching abilities, SUVA(254) values and orders of aromaticity. Mineralization rates as revealed by F- release were negatively affected by NOM during CIP photocatalysis. TPs arising from hydroxylation and defluorination were generally suppressed by NOM isolates in UVA/LED and UVA/LED/TiO2 systems. In contrast, dealkylation and oxidation of piperazine ring were promoted by NOM. The enhancement in the apparent formation kinetics (k(app)) of TP245, TP291, TP334a, TP334b and TP362 followed the order of SRNOM > SRHA > SAHA. k(app) values were positively correlated with O/C ratio, carboxyl content, E2/E3 and fluorescence index (FI) of NOM and negatively related with SUVA(254) values. The observed correlations indicate that NOM properties are important in determining the fate and transformation of organic contaminants during photolysis and photocatalysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) are increasing in a large number of lakes across the Northern hemisphere. This browning serves a dual role for biota by protecting against harmful ultraviolet radiation, while also absorbing photosynthetically active radiation. The photochemical activation of DOM and subsequent formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a potentially harmful side effect, but can be difficult to measure directly in situ. In this study, we combine a data set of physico-chemical properties from 71 Nordic lakes with in vitro ROS formation quantum yields to predict ROS formations across a representative boreal ecosystem gradient. For the upper centimeter of the water column, we calculate ROS formations in the range of 7.93-12.56 mu mol L-1 h(-1). In the first meter, they range between 1.69 and 6.69 mu mol L-1 h(-1) and in the remaining depth the range is 0.01-0.46 mu mol L-1 h(-1). These ROS formations are comparable with previously field-measured hydrogen peroxide formation rates and likely affect both phyto- and zooplankton, as well as lake chemistry. Interestingly, wavelengths of the visible spectrum (>400 nm) contribute more than half of the overall ROS formation in surface-near water layers. The association between DOM and ROS formation was found to be two-fold. While DOM promotes ROS formation in the first centimeters of the water column, the shading effect of light attenuation overpowers this with increasing depth. In the context of water browning, our results indicate the emergence of an underestimated oxidative stress environment for lake biota in the upper centimeters of the water column.

In this work, the better coagulation performance of TXC than TC and PTC was systematically elucidated from the following aspects: the physicochemical properties of the three coagulants, the removal of turbidity and organic matter, and the complexation reactions in coagulation. The results demonstrate that the merits of TXC were attributable to the following characteristics: (1) the higher surface charge density/total surface site concentration/isoelectric point of TXC hydrolysates, (2) the formation of TXC hydrolysates with a net-work structure, and (3) the strong binding affinity of TXC hydrolysates to organic matter caused by the bonded acetylacetone in the TXC framework. In short, the hydrolysis behavior of TXC significantly differed from both its precursor, TC, and the prehydrolyzed PTC. The difference in the hydrolysis of TXC was derived from the gelation process, which led to the polymerization of Ti in a way different from prehydrolyzation. The elucidation of the hydrolysis mechanisms is useful for the better application of Ti-based coagulants and may shed light on the preparation of other metal salts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

   TUMORS; DIFFERENTIATION; ENTITY; ADULTS
AB BACKGROUND: Liponeurocytoma is a very rare tumor classified as grade neuronal and mixed (neuronal-glial tumors) according to 2016 World Health Organization classification of tumors of the central nervous system. The median age at detection is 50 years, and the most frequent location is the posterior cranial fossa, especially within the cerebellar hemispheres; liponeurocytomas arising in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) are exceptional.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we report the clinical, radiological, and pathological characteristics of a CPA liponeurocytoma in a 35-year-old woman, as well as a review of the literature. This unusual cisternal location raises the issue of the differential imaging diagnosis with much more common CPA tumors (e.g., meningiomas, vestibular schwannomas, ependymomas, epidermoid cyst, hemangioblastomas, medulloblastomas).
   CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, 59 cases of cerebellar liponeurocytomas have been reported to date, which include only 6 cases of CPA liponeurocytomas. Treatment relies on total removal whenever possible, with an excellent prognosis, but a high MIB-1 index (>10%) and/or incomplete tumor resection are the main adverse prognostic factors.

   TREATMENT; MICROSURGICAL ANATOMY; STENT-RETRIEVER; RECANALIZATION;
   THROMBOLYSIS; OUTCOMES; ACCESS; VESSEL
AB BACKGROUND: A cross-circulation technique involves gaining access to a cerebral vessel through a patent anterior or posterior communicating artery. This technique may be used in patients with emergent large-vessel occlusions and an unfavorable direct route to the occlusion. While few previous reports have demonstrated a successful cross-circulation technique for treatment of emergent large-vessel occlusions, we present the first 2 cases of transanterior communicating artery stent retriever thrombectomy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Case #1: A 64-year-old female presented with acute right middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. She demonstrated a "triple-tandem" brachiocephalic-internal carotid artery-middle cerebral artery occlusion, thus precluding direct access to the right MCA. Successful stent retriever mechanical thrombectomy was performed across the anterior communicating artery, using a left internal carotid artery approach. Case #2: A 70-year old female presented with acute occlusion of the left MCA and tandem occlusion of the cervical left internal carotid artery. Multiple attempts to catheterize the left common carotid artery were unsuccessful. She underwent successful stent retriever mechanical thrombectomy across a patent anterior communicating artery, using a right internal carotid artery approach.
   CONCLUSIONS: Timely recanalization of an occluded artery plays a critical role in the prognosis of patients with acute ischemic stroke. Successful stent retriever mechanical thrombectomy of an occluded MCA is possible using a transanterior communicating artery approach in patients without a direct access route to the occluded intracranial vessel. We review the pathophysiology of tandem lesions, access routes to intracranial occlusions, and the literature on cross-circulation techniques to treat emergent large-vessel occlusions.

TI Dural-Based Cavernous Malformation at the Cerebral Convexity: Report of
   Two Pediatric Patients
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Cavernous malformation; Cerebral convexity; Dural-based; Meningioma
ID HEMANGIOMA MIMICKING; MENINGIOMA; ANGIOMA; PREVALENCE; MATER
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial cavernous malformations (CMs) are usually located at the cerebral parenchyma; dural-based CMs outside the middle fossa are rarely reported. To our knowledge, dural-based CMs located at the cerebral convexity are even rarer in that only 2 pediatric cases have ever been reported. In this report, we present 2 extremely rare cases of dural-based CMs at the cerebral convexity in pediatric patients. The clinical course, radiologic and pathologic features, treatment, and follow-up are described.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The first case is a 6-year-old boy who presented with headache and vomiting and was found to have an acute subdural hematoma and space-occupying lesion. Intraoperative findings and histologic examination were consistent with a CM. He experienced an uneventful postoperative recovery. The second case is a 43-day-old female neonate who presented with a progressively enlarging neoplasm at the right occipital region since birth. Computed tomography of the head performed at admission showed a slight hyperdense occupying lesion communicating between the intra- and extracranial cavity through a skull defect. The lesion was resected en bloc and histologic examination was in accord with a CM.
   CONCLUSIONS: The clinical manifestations and radiologic characteristics of dural-based CMs are nonspecific. Unlike that of their cerebral parenchymal counterparts, the radiologic appearance of dural-based CMs is confusing and misleading. Surgical resection is the primary treatment selection for dural-based CMs. In cases with no close relationship to dural sinuses, complete surgical resection with minimal blood loss and few neurologic deficits could be easily achieved.

AB BACKGROUND: Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) is a rare complication of some malignant cancers. It is most commonly described in women with gynecologic or breast malignancies; however, there have been reports in other types of cancers. Symptoms include ataxia, dysarthria, and tremors, which could be the first manifestations of an underlying malignancy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old woman had an acute PCD with anti-Yo antibodies from an underlying breast invasive ductal carcinoma. She presented with intracranial hypertension in the posterior cranial fossa that required an emergent decompressive craniectomy.
   CONCLUSIONS: PCD is an uncommon disease that may manifest initially as posterior cranial fossa hypertension and subsequent acute hydrocephalus owing to diffuse cerebellar swelling. To our knowledge, this is the first described case of an anti-Yo PCD that has manifested as acute posterior cranial fossa hypertension owing to diffuse cerebellar edema. Early diagnosis and treatment should be pursued to improve long-term outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: Microsurgical skills and eye-hand coordination need continuous training to be developed and refined. However, well-equipped microsurgical laboratories are not so widespread as their setup is expensive. Herein, we present a novel microsurgical training system that requires a high-resolution personal computer screen, smartphones, and virtual reality glasses.
   METHODS: A smartphone placed on a holder at a height of about 15-20 cm from the surgical target field is used as the webcam of the computer. A specific software is used to duplicate the video camera image. The video may be transferred from the computer to another smartphone, which may be connected to virtual reality glasses.
   RESULTS: Using the previously described training model, we progressively performed more and more complex microsurgical exercises. It did not take long to set up our system, thus saving time for the training sessions.
   CONCLUSION: Our proposed training model may represent an affordable and efficient system to improve eye-hand coordination and dexterity in using not only the operating microscope but also endoscopes and exoscopes.

ID GREEN VIDEO-ANGIOGRAPHY; MICROSURGICAL TREATMENT
AB BACKGROUND: In the surgical treatment of spinal dural arteriovnous fistulas (DAVFs), intraoperative definition of anatomic characteristics of the DAVF and identification of the fistulous point is mandatory to effectively exclude the DAVF.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Intraoperative ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound integrated with color Doppler ultrasound was applied in the surgical setting for a cervical DAVF to identify the fistulous point and evaluate correct occlusion of the fistula.
   CONCLUSIONS: Integration of intraoperative ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound is a simple, cost-effective technique that provides an opportunity for real-time dynamic visualization of DAVF vascular patterns, identification of the fistulous point, and assessment of correct exclusion. Compared with other intraoperative tools, such as indocyanine green videoangiography, it allows the surgeon to visualize hidden anatomic and vascular structures, minimizing surgical manipulation and guiding the surgeon during resection.

AB OBJECTIVES: Laser therapy has become an appealing treatment modality in neurosurgery. In this review, we report on the history, physics, surgical steps, indications and uses, and complications that have been reported to date.
   METHODS: An extensive literature search was performed for laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) and laser therapy in the context of glial tumors, metastatic lesions, pediatric brain tumors, and radiation necrosis. Reported complications in each series also were reviewed.
   RESULTS: In the past decade, multiple studies have demonstrated the use, outcomes, and complications associated with LITT in neurosurgery. These same studies have consistently reported an overall benefit of LITT in cases in which traditional surgical approaches may be limited by the patient's clinical status, tumor location, or overall prognosis. However, there have been complications reported from local effects of thermal damage, technical error, and edema development. Increased experience has reduced complications and brought more promising results.
   CONCLUSIONS: With the advent of real-time monitoring and damage estimation, LITT has gained ground in the management of intracranial tumors. Larger scale trials must be performed to develop standard protocols to define specific indications for use. Further large clinical studies for LITT in non-oncologic cases are also of interest.

AB BACKGROUND: Primary meningeal melanocytoma is a benign lesion in the central nervous system derived from leptomeningeal melanocytes, most commonly growing in the posterior fossa and cervical spinal cord. The sellar primary meningeal melanocytoma (SPMM) is an exceptionally rare tumor. Here we report the ninth published case of an SPMM, and also discuss the problems of differential diagnosis and management of these tumors.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient presented with visual impairment and irregular menstruation with no other symptoms. Her general examination was otherwise unremarkable. Endocrine tests disclosed normal endocrine function except for slight hyperprolactinemia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a sellar lesion. The patient underwent a successful total transsphenoidal removal of the tumor without neurologic sequelae. Based on this case report, SPMM should be included in the differential diagnosis of malignant and/or metastatic melanoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: SPMM is an exceptionally rare tumor. Differentiating sellar melanocytic tumors from other sellar diseases through clinical and radiologic investigations is very difficult. The treatment of choice for SPMM is complete surgical resection via a transsphenoidal approach. For patients with a partially resected tumor, radiotherapy is an effective complementary treatment modality.

TI Misclassification of Case-Control Studies in Neurosurgery and Proposed
   Solutions
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Review
DE Case-control study; Cohort study; Neurosurgery; Observational studies;
   Research methods
ID EFFICACY; WOMEN
AB OBJECTIVE: Case-control studies (CCS) and cohort studies (CS) are common research designs in neurosurgery. But the term case-control study is frequently misused in the neurosurgical literature, with many articles reported as CCS, even although their methodology does not respect the basic components of a CCS. We sought to estimate the extent of these discrepancies in neurosurgical literature, explore factors contributing to mislabeling, and shed some light on study design reporting.
   METHODS: We identified 31 top-ranking pure neurosurgical journals and searched them for articles reported as CCS, either in the title or in the abstract. The articles were read to determine if they really were CCS according to STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines. Article assessment was conducted in duplicate (agreement [kappa statistics] = 99.82%).
   RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-four articles met our inclusion criteria, 133 of which (59.38%) correctly labeled the case-control design, whereas 91 (40.62%) misclassified this study design. Cohort studies (CS) were the most common design mislabeled as case-control studies in 76 articles (33.93%), 57 of which (25.45%) were retrospective CS. The mislabeling of CCS impairs the appropriate indexing, classification, and sorting of evidence. Mislabeling CS for CCS leads to a downgrading of evidence as CS represent the highest level of evidence for observational studies. Odds ratios instead of relative risk are reported for these studies, resulting in a distortion of the measurement of the effect size, compounded when these are summarized in systematic reviews and pooled in meta-analyses.
   CONCLUSIONS: Many studies reported as CCS are not true CCS. Reporting guidelines should include items that ensure that studies are labeled correctly. STROBE guidelines should be implemented in assessment of observational studies. Researchers in neurosurgery need better training in research methods and terminology. We also recommend accrued vigilance from reviewers and editors.

AB The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery has recently focused its attention on the lack of surgical care worldwide. Like other surgical subspecialties, neurosurgical care needs to be better distributed around the world, with a major focus on low- to middle-income countries. Neurosurgical diseases like hydrocephalus, traumatic brain injury, and brain tumors have a high impact on families, individual quality of life, and cost for the society. Implementation of neurosurgical care in poor settings is not easy. More than other surgeries, neurosurgery requires great amounts of human resources, dedicated environments, and specialized postoperative care. It is responsibility of the neurosurgical community to identify major areas of current gaps and outline strategies for intervention.

AB BACKGROUND: Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy (EMT) is the standard of care for eligible patients presenting with anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to emergent large vessel occlusion (ELVO). The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to compare the outcomes between patients undergoing general anesthesia (GA) versus conscious sedation (CS) for these procedures.
   METHODS: A literature review was performed to identify studies reporting the EMT outcomes of AIS patients who underwent GA or CS for the procedure. Baseline, treatment, and outcomes data were analyzed. Good outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 3 months, and successful reperfusion was defined as modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grade of 2b-3.
   RESULTS: Nine studies, comprising a total of 1379 patients treated with GA (n = 761) or CS (n = 618) for EMT, were included. Based on pooled data, GA achieved good outcome in 35% and successful reperfusion in 81%, whereas CS achieved good outcome in 41% and successful reperfusion in 75%. Meta-analyses showed no significant differences in the rates of good outcome (P = 0.51) or successful reperfusion (P = 0.39) between the GA and CS groups. The rates of pneumonia were significantly higher in the GA group (21% vs. 11%; P = 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of either GA or CS during EMT for patients with anterior circulation acute ELVO does not yield significantly different rates of functional independence at 3 months.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the biomechanics and biocompatibility of polyurethane (PU) foam with adjustable stiffness as a filling material for a novel spondyloplasty that is designed to reduce the risk of postoperative adjacent level fractures.
   METHODS: Sixty individual porcine lumbar vertebrae were randomly split into 4 groups: A, B, C, and D. Group A served as unmodified vertebral body controls. Groups B, C, and D consisted of hollowed vertebral bodies. Vertebrae of groups C and D were filled with adjustable PU foams of different stiffness. The compressive strength and stiffness of vertebrae from groups A-D were recorded and analyzed. 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were cultured with preformed PU foams for 4 days to test biocompatibility.
   RESULTS: The strength and stiffness of the hollowed groups were lower than in group A. However, the differences were not statistically significant between group A and group C (P > 0.05), and were obviously different be- tween group A and group B or group D < 0.01 and <0.05, respectively). Moreover, the strength and stiffness after filling foams in group C or group D were significantly greater than in group B (P < 0.01 and <0.05, respectively). Live/dead staining of 3T3 cells confirmed the biocompatibility of the PU foam.
   CONCLUSIONS: The new PU foam shows adaptability regarding its stiffness and excellent cytocompatibility in vitro. The results support the clinical translation of the new PU foams as augmentation material in the development of a novel spondyloplasty.

AB BACKGROUND: Although intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are focal bulges of arterial walls, an uncharacterized predisposing factor that affects cerebral arteries may increase tortuosity of intracranial arteries in patients with IAs.
   METHODS: Subjects who underwent routine health examinations and magnetic resonance angiography at a university hospital health promotion center were enrolled. Age- and sex-matched control subjects were selected from among individuals who did not have IAs. Tortuosity of right and left middle cerebral arteries and basilar artery (BA) was measured. Distant factor [(arc/chord ratio x 100) - 100] was used to estimate tortuosity. Vascular risk factors and intracranial arterial tortuosities were compared between subjects with IAs and control subjects. Independent factors associated with intracranial artery tortuosity were also investigated.
   RESULTS: Of 18,954 (1.9%) subjects, 367 exhibited IAs. The prevalence of hypertension (P = 0.01) and current smoking (P = 0.01) were higher in subjects with IAs than in control subjects. The BA tortuosity was greater in subjects with IAs compared with control subjects (9.0 +/- 8.1 vs. 5.5 +/- 7.2; P< 0.001). In addition to hypertension, smoking, and absence of coronary artery disease, BA tortuosity (P< 0.001) was independently associated with presence of lAs. The presence of IAs (P < 0.001) and absence of coronary artery disease (P = 0.002) were independently associated with high BA tortuosity.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IAs exhibit a more tortuous BA. A predisposing factor weakening the cerebrovasculature in patients with IAs may exist and may manifest as high tortuosity of intracranial arteries.

ID INTUBATION; TRIAL; BLUNT; CARE
AB BACKGROUND: Tracheostomy has proven benefits for patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. However, whether early tracheostomy (ET; <10 days after injury) can also improve outcomes in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) (Glasgow Coma Scale score <= 8) remains controversial. The aim of this study was to clarify this question.
   METHODS: We searched 4 databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Elsevier ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library) for articles comparing the outcomes of ET with late tracheotomy or prolonged intubation in patients with severe TBI. Two reviewers were asked to record the major outcome data as follows: length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, mortality, and incidence of pneumonia. Both random-effects and fixed-effects models were used.
   RESULTS: Eight studies met our inclusion criteria, with a total of 797 patients in the ET group and 871 patients in the late tracheostomy or prolonged intubation (not-ET) group. A meta-analysis of these 8 studies suggested that ET could reduce the length of ICU stay (mean difference [MD], -3.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], -3.75 to -2.41), duration of mechanical ventilation (MD, -4.92; 95% CI, -6.82 to -3.02), length of hospital stay (MD, -4.79; 95% CI, -8.63 to - 0.94), and incidence of pneumonia (odds ratio [OR], 0.64; 95% CI, 0.530.78), but seemed to be independent of mortality (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.90-1.75).
   CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests that ET may reduce the length of ICU and hospital stays, duration of mechanical ventilation, and incidence of pneumonia in patients with severe TBI. Well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Metastasis to the spinal column is a common feature of primary tumors of the breast, prostate, lung, and other organs. Surgical intervention can be performed via the traditional open surgery (OS) approach or the minimally invasive surgery (MIS) approach. This study aims to assess the available evidence of perioperative outcomes of MIS versus OS for patients with metastatic spinal disease.
   METHODS: We followed recommended PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews. Six electronic databases were searched to identify all potentially relevant studies published from inception to October 2017. Data were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis of proportions.
   RESULTS: Six studies satisfied the criteria for inclusion into this study. There were 292 patients with metastatic spinal disease described in the cohort, treated with either MIS (n = 155, 53%) or OS (n = 137, 47%). Compared with OS, MIS resulted in statistically significant reduction in blood loss (mean difference, -601.48 mL; P < 0.001) and length of stay (mean difference, -4.60 days; P = 0.002). In terms of complications, MIS had a significantly reduced incidence compared with OS (21/155 [14%] and 37/136 [27%], respectively; odds ratio, 0.41; P = 0.005). In terms of operation duration (P = 0.43), postoperative functional (P = 0.76) and pain (P = 0.84) outcomes, MIS was non-inferior to OS.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical intervention by an MIS approach in patients with metastatic spinal disease seems to provide equivalent outcomes compared with OS and reduces morbidity and length of stay. Future studies that are larger, prospective, and longer-term will validate the findings of this study and elucidate the optimal role for MIS in the surgical management of metastatic spinal disease.

AB OBJECTIVE: Treatment options for trigeminal neuralgia include microvascular decompression (MVD) and Gamma Knife surgery (GKS). There is no consensus which option is more effective at providing immediate and long-lasting pain relief. This study evaluated the differences between these 2 options in terms of rates of complete pain relief and pain-free recurrence.
   METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of published studies of MVD and GKS for treatment of trigeminal neuralgia from 2004 to 2014. Studies were selected using a MEDLINE/PubMed search and from subsequent inspection of references from articles found in the initial search. Common outcome measures reported in the studies were used for meta-analysis to make conclusions based on current available data.
   RESULTS: The MVD group included 18 articles with 2650 patients, and the GKS group included 25 articles with 2846 patients. MVD was found to have a significantly higher rate of initial pain-free outcomes (Barrow Neurological Institute grade I) compared with GKS (92.22% vs. 61.46%, P < 0.0001). MVD was also found to have a significantly higher rate of long-term pain-free outcomes at last followup compared with GKS (79.37% vs. 41.62%, P < 0.0001). MVD was found to have a similar rate of pain-free recurrence compared with GKS (14.93% vs. 19.38%, P = 0.2536).
   CONCLUSIONS: MVD may be a more effective intervention than GKS owing to higher rates of initial pain-free outcomes and long-term pain-free outcomes. There is a need for more consistent data reporting of outcomes for treatment of trigeminal neuralgia.

AB INTRODUCTION: A prospective study was designed to elucidate incidence and predictors of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients undergoing craniotomies.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-two patients who underwent craniotomies received pre- and postoperative venous ultrasonography and/or contrast-enhanced spiral computed tomography for diagnosis of DVT. The primary endpoint was DVT occurrence. Serial levels of serum D-dimer, soluble fibrin, and thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Twenty-four of 92 patients (26.1%) had DVT, of whom 10 (41.7%) were diagnosed preoperatively. In patients with preoperative DVT, age, incidence of decreased performance status and leg paresis, levels of D-dimer, soluble fibrin, and TAT were significantly greater. In patients with postoperative DVT, length of surgery, incidence of decreased postoperative performance status, levels of D-dimer on postoperative days (POD) 3, 7, and 14, and TAT on POD7 were significantly greater. Patients with postoperative DVT had elevated D-dimer levels on POD 7 compared with POD 3. The D-dimer cutoff of 2.65 mu g/mL at POD 7 could be used to identify DVT with 85.7% sensitivity and 72.3% specificity. A cutoff of 5.25 mu g/mL at POD 7 yielded a specificity of 96.9%. Decreased performance status and elevated D-dimer were independent predictors for preoperative DVT, prolonged operation time, and elevated D-dimer on POD 7 for postoperative DVT.
   CONCLUSIONS: DVT frequently was observed in patients before and after undergoing craniotomies. Patients with decreased performance status should be preoperatively screened for DVT by checking D-dimer levels. Elevated D-dimer levels on POD 7 compared with POD 3 and D-dimer levels greater than 2.65 mu g/nt at POD7 suggest the presence of DVT.

AB BACKGROUND: An estimated 5 billion people worldwide lack access to basic surgical care. In particular, the vast majority of low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) currently struggle to provide adequate neurosurgical services. Significant harriers exist, including limited access to trained medical, nursing, and allied health staff; lack of equipment; and availability of services at reasonable distance and at reasonable cost to patients. An accurate assessment of current neurosurgical capacity in LIMCs is an essential first step in tackling this deficit.
   OBJECTIVE: To quantify the neurosurgical operational capacity and assess access to neurosurgical services in LMICs, by taking into account the location of workforce and services.
   METHODS: A total of 141 LMICs were contacted and asked to report the number of currently practicing neurosurgeons, access to computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging, and availability of neurosurgical equipment (microscope, endoscope, bipolar diathermy, high-speed neurosurgical drill). A proposed World Federation of Neurosurgeons classification was used to stratify cities based on the level of neurosurgical care that could be provided. The data were geocoded and analyzed in Redivis (Redivis Inc.) to assess the percentage of the population covered within a 2-hour travel time of a city offering differing levels of neurosurgical care.
   RESULTS: 68 countries provided complete data (response rate, 482%). Eleven countries reported having no practicing neurosurgeons. The average percentage of the population with access to neurosurgical services within a 2-hour window is 25.26% in sub-Saharan Africa, 62.3% in Latin America and the Caribbean, 29.64% in East Asia and the Pacific, 52.83% in South Asia, 79.65% in the Middle East and North Africa, and 93.3% in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
   CONCLUSIONS: There are several challenges to the provision of adequate neurosurgical services in low-resource settings. This study used mapping techniques to determine the current global neurosurgical workforce capacity and distribution. We have used our findings to identify areas for improvement. These include increasing and improving neurosurgical training programs worldwide, recruiting students and young physicians into the field, and retaining existing neurosurgeons within their home countries.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the optimal timing and type of surgical treatment of myelomeningocele (MMC)-related spinal deformities and long-term follow-up of surgical treatment.
   METHODS: We reviewed and presented clinical pictures, treatment strategies and results of 20 patients with MMC-related spinal deformities treated at our center between 2010 and 2017.
   RESULTS: The average patient age was 6.3 years. The average preoperative neurologic status according to a modified Japan Orthopedic Association (mJOA) scale was 7.3 points (Benzel's modification). Average functional status was 41 points according to a functional independent measure scale (FIM). The average angle of kyphosis was 83.7 degrees, that of scoliosis was 36.7 degrees, and that of lordosis was 67 degrees (Cobb angles). The average duration of surgery was 234 minutes, and the average total blood loss was 175 ml. The average angle of kyphosis correction was 61 degrees, that of scoliosis correction was 25 degrees, and that of lordosis correction was 25 degrees (Cobb angles). The average duration of hospitalization was 16.6 days, and the average follow-up was 34.5 months. The total number of complications was 13. Reoperation was required in 9 cases. Neurologic status according to the mJOA scale improved by 0.6 point on average. Functional status according to the FIM increased by 6.6 points on average.
   CONCLUSIONS: Early surgical correction of MMC related spinal deformities improves body balance and quality of life. The dual growing rod technique is safe and effective in cases of moderate neuromuscular spinal deformities at an early age. Kyphectomy is a challenging procedure with high complication rates, especially skin problems, but there are no alternative procedures for cases of heavy rigid kyphosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Depressed mood following neuronal damage not only impedes functional recovery but also negatively affects quality of life for many patients. Depressed patients with cervical myelopathy often show improvement in both mood and motor function after spinal decompression surgery; however, the neural mechanism underlying this psychological benefit from surgery remains unclear. The aim of this study was to clarify the brain sites that relate to alleviation of depression after spinal decompression surgery.
   METHODS: We compared brain activity of patients with cervical myelopathy (n = 6) with healthy participants (n = 5) using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We then analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging data to find the brain regions that correlated with depression severity (n = 12; 6 preoperative patients and 6 postoperative patients) and compared preoperative imaging data with postoperative imaging data from patients.
   RESULTS: Spinal decompression surgery alleviated depression and diminished anterior cingulate cortex activity. Simultaneously, supplementary motor area activity, which was increased in patients with myelopathy compared with control subjects, was diminished after surgery .
   CONCLUSIONS: Traditionally, surgical indications for myelopathy are determined by the severity of sensorimotor symptoms without considering psychological symptoms. We anticipate our results will lead to more informed surgical decisions for cervical spondylosis myelopathy.

AB OBJECTIVE: Skull base meningiomas carry a nonnegligible risk of recurrence. In particular, those arising from the sphenoid wings or middle cranial fossa penetrate into extracranial regions, uncommonly showing massive expansion into the craniofacial regions on recurrence. The role of endoscopic endonasal surgery for those intractable lesions remains unclear.
   METHODS: We performed endoscopic endonasal craniofacial surgery for 8 recurrent meningiomas invading into the pterygopalatine fossa, infratemporal fossa, nasopharynx, paranasal sinus, or orbit, comprising 2 meningothelial and 1 fibrous meningiomas (World Health Organization [WHO] grade I), 3 atypical and 1 clear cell meningiomas (grade II), and 1 anaplastic meningioma (grade III). All were large (15-80 cm(3); median, 45 cm(3)) and highly vascularized.
   RESULTS: All 8 tumors were sufficiently resected. Gross total resection of the craniofacial part of the lesions was achieved in 5 patients (62.5%). In 3 patients with WHO grade I meningiomas and 1 with grade II, tumors were successfully controlled as of the last follow-up. In 4 patients with WHO grade II or III meningiomas, craniofacial lesions were controlled, whereas original intracranial lesions were poorly controlled and became critical.
   CONCLUSIONS: We consider the endoscopic endonasal approach as an acceptable, less-invasive alternative for recurrent craniofacial meningioma. Although all these cases were relatively large and highly vascularized, preoperative endovascular embolization of the feeding arteries contributes to significantly reducing vascularity of the tumors, and local control of the craniofacial lesions was successfully achieved in all cases. Endoscopic endonasal craniofacial surgery enabled sufficient mass reduction without disfiguring facial incisions.

AB BACKGROUND: Spheno-orbital meningiomas (SOMs) are complex tumors involving the sphenoid wing, the orbit, and sometimes the cavernous sinus with bone hyperostosis and sheet-like dural involvement. Optimal removal, proptosis cure, and visual preservation remain a challenge.
   OBJECTIVE: To study the management of surgically treated SOMs.
   METHODS: The clinical records of 130 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for SOMs were retrospectively collected in a database during a 20-year period to analyze symptoms, surgical technique, clinical outcome, and follow-up.
   RESULTS: Among the 130 patients (mean age 51.2 + 9.5 years), 91.5% were female. The most typical symptoms recorded were proptosis in 94.6%, visual impairment in 37.7%, and oculomotor paresis in 10.0%. Simpson grade I-II removal was achieved in 97 patients (74.6%). After 1 year, proptosis was improved in 60% of cases. A total of 44.9% of the patients with preoperative visual acuity impairment were improved. Periorbital excision was statistically linked to proptosis decreasing (P = 0.0001) and optic canal decompression was linked to visual stabilization (P = 0.03). Bone reconstruction prevented temporal muscle atrophy (P = 0.01) and unaesthetic results (P = 0.0001). Mean follow-up was 76.5 months (range 3-288 months), and the mean time for recurrence was 54.2 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: A single-stage optimal surgery with bone reconstruction appears to be the best first-line treatment, on a case-by-case analysis. Optic canal decompression and periorbital excision have to be performed in case of visual disturbance and proptosis. SOMs require a long-term follow-up because of a delayed high rate of recurrence.

AB OBJECTIVE: To correlate pretherapeutic resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) measures with pretherapeutic head tremor presence and/or further improvement 1 year after stereotactic radiosurgical thalamotomy (SRS-T) for essential tremor (ET).
   METHODS: We prospectively collected head tremor scores (range, 0-3) and rs-fMRI data for a cohort of 17 consecutive ET patients in pretherapeutic and 1 year after SRS-T states. We additionally acquired rs-fMRI data for a healthy control (HC) group (n = 12). Group-level independent component analysis (n = 17 for pretherapeutic rs-fMRI) was applied to decompose neuroimaging data into 20 large-scale brain networks using a standard approach. Through spatial regression, we projected 1 year after SRS-T and HC rs-fMRI time points, on the same 20 brain networks.
   RESULTS: Pretherapeutic interconnectivity (IC) strength between the network including bilateral thalamus and limbic system with left supplementary motor area predicted head tremor improvement at 1 year after SRS-T (family-wise corrected P < 0.001, cluster size K-c = 146). For the statistically significant cluster, IC strength was strongest in HCs (mean, 4.6; median, 3.8) compared with pre- (mean, 0.1; median, 0.2) or posttherapeutic (mean, -02; median, 0.09) states.
   CONCLUSIONS: Baseline measures of IC between bilateral thalamus and limbic system with left supplementary motor area may predict head tremor arrest after thalamotomy. However, procedures such as SRS-T, for this particular clinical feature, do not align patients to HCs in terms of functional brain connectivity. We postulate that supplementary motor area is modulating head tremor appearance, by abnormal connectivity with the thalamolimbic system.

AB BACKGROUND: It is becoming increasingly common to incorporate chemotherapy (CT) with radiotherapy (RI) in the treatment of low-grade gliomas (LGGs) after surgical resection. However, there is a lack of literature comparing survival of patients who underwent RT or CT alone.
   METHODS: The U.S. National Cancer Data Base was used to identify patients with histologically confirmed, World Health Organization grade 2 gliomas who received either RT alone or CT alone after surgery from 2004 to 2013. Overall survival (OS) was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression, and propensity-score-matched analysis.
   RESULTS: In total, 2253 patients with World Health Organization grade 2 gliomas were included, of whom 1466 (65.1%) received RT alone and 787 (34.9%) CT alone. The median OS was 98.9 months for the RT alone group and 125.8 months for the CT alone group. On multivariable analysis, CT alone was associated with a significant OS benefit compared with RT alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.405; 95% confidence interval, 0.277-0.592; P < 0.001). On subgroup analyses, the survival advantage of CT alone over RT alone persisted across all age groups, and for the subtotal resection and biopsy groups, but not in the gross total resection group. In propensity-score-matched analysis, CT alone still showed significantly improved OS compared with RT alone (HR, 0.612; 95A) confidence interval, 0.5060.741; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that CT alone was independently associated with longer OS compared with RT alone in patients with LGGs who underwent surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: Cranioplasty (CP) can be either embedded or covered, according to the implants used. However, determining which one is better in treating cranial defects is difficult. This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes and complications of embedded CP and covered CP.
   METHODS: A multicenter retrospective study was undertaken with patients who underwent CP with polyetheretherketone (PEEK) implants and titanium implants between January 2014 and March 2017. The medical records of these patients were reviewed retrospectively and analyzed statistically.
   RESULTS: There were 185 patients, including 75 patients (40.5%) who underwent embedded CP with PEEK implants (PEEK group) and 110 patients (59.5%) who underwent covered CP using titanium mesh (titanium group), in this study. Compared with the titanium group, the incidence of overall complications (P = 0.03), postoperative new seizures (P = 0.01), postoperative implant exposure (P = 0.03), and reoperation (P = 0.01) was significantly lower in PEEK group. The rate of brain function improvement (P = 0.01) after CP and satisfaction with CP (P = 0.01) in patients in the PEEK group were higher than that in the titanium group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that embedded CP with PEEK has a distinct advantage in brain function improvement and fewer postoperative complications compared with covered CP with titanium mesh. However, the high cost of PEEK is an obvious drawback. This study can help both neurosurgeons and patients in choosing a better therapeutic method to achieve the most satisfactory outcome in treating cranial defects.

AB BACKGROUND: We report a rare case of hemorrhagic cavernous sinus hemangioma with sudden onset of abducens palsy.
   CASE DESCRIPTIONS: Sudden onset of diplopia occurred in a 49-year-old female. Head computed tomography findings revealed a high-density mass in the right cavernous sinus with protrusion to the sphenoid sinus. Endoscopic endo-nasal surgery was performed, though early recurrence was noted. A Gamma Knife surgical procedure was then performed to prevent early recurrence after histopathologic confirmation of cavernous sinus hemangioma. Thereafter, the tumor was controlled and abducens palsy disappeared.
   CONCLUSIONS: For treatment of cavernous sinus hemangioma, stereotactic radiosurgery should be considered as primary or adjuvant treatment in the very early phase after removal, to avoid early recurrence.

AB BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (PARR-guided biopsy is an emerging diagnostic technique that holds great promise for otherwise difficult to access neuroanatomy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we describe MRI-guided biopsy of a suprasellar lesion located posterior and superior to the pituitary stalk. The approach was implemented successfully in a 38-year-old woman who had developed progressive visual deterioration.
   CONCLUSION: Intraoperative MRI revealed the need for trajectory adjustment due to an unintended, minor deviation in the burr hole entry point, demonstrating the benefit of an MRI-guided approach. Langerhans cell histiocytosis was diagnosed after biopsy, and the lesion regressed after cladribine treatment. Technical nuances of the case are reviewed in the context of the available literature.

AB INTRODUCTION: Fluorescein sodium is one of the fluorophores that is used in the resection of intracranial lesions. It is commonly used along with a customized microscope, which is expensive and not available universally. In this study, we describe a simple, inexpensive method for better visualization of intracranial and spinal cord lesions with fluorescein.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: After a test dose, 20 mg/kg of fluorescein sodium was administered intravenously at the time of intubation. A blue light source was used before resection for precise localization of the intracranial lesions after durotomy. Most of the resection was done under the white light, while the blue light was used intermittently to delineate the pathologic tissue from the normal tissue and to ensure safe maximal resection. The intensity of fluorescein staining under white light and blue light was noted.
   RESULTS: The study comprised 40 cases of gliomas, meningiomas, abscesses, spinal cord tumors, and cerebellopontine angle lesions. Thirty-five lesions showed good fluorescence under the blue light, which helped us achieve better resection of the pathologic lesions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Fluorescein sodium is a safe dye; it can be used to aid in precise localization and safe maximal resection of the pathologic tissue with the help of a blue light source at any center with challenged resources. The blue light enhances the fluorescence and visualization of the pathologic tissue, and this technique can be adopted by any surgeon without much difficulty even with a basic neurosurgical setup.

AB BACKGROUND: Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) complicated with rupture and hemorrhage of intracranial aneurysms is not commonly seen in clinical practice. Here we report a middle-aged female patient who presented with acute severe headache.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Head computed tomography (CT) demonstrated an extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage. Digital subtraction angiography demonstrated coarctation and occlusion of the proximal thoracic aorta and occlusion of the terminal aortic arch. Aortic-intracranial CT angiography (CTA) confirmed a CoA complicated with an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Clipping of the anterior communicating artery aneurysm was performed via a left lateral orbital approach. Postoperative intracranial CTA showed complete clipping of the aneurysm. The patient was discharged postoperatively with good recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The pathophysiological mechanism of CoA complicated with intracranial aneurysm remains unclear, but attention should be given to the relationship between the 2 entities in clinical practice, and effective treatment should be provided according to specific conditions.

AB BACKGROUND: Battery replacement or revision surgery for neuromodulation implants is conventionally performed using sharp dissection. Meticulous dissection within thick scar tissue is vital to avoid damage to surrounding lead(s), which could result in more extensive revision surgery. Traditional electrosurgery devices are contraindicated as the emitted energy can be transferred to the hardware, resulting in implant or tissue damage with severe consequent complications.
   OBJECTIVE: We report our experience and potential applications of a novel, pulsed monopolar radiofrequency energy device (PEAK PlasmaBlade, Medtronic PLC, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA), which facilitates dissection around implants without the risk of damaging or transmitting energy through the system.
   METHODS: We conducted a 2-center retrospective study re review the indications, safety, and efficacy of the PlasmaBlade in 57 cases requiring either neuromodulation system replacement or revision. Deep brain stimulator (DBS) battery replacements were undertaken in 45 cases, 8 vagal nerve stimulator battery revisions, 2 intrathecal baclofen system revision, 1 DBS extension revision, and 1 DBS scar revision around the cranial portion of the lead.
   RESULTS: All cases proceeded without adverse event or damage to lead/generator and with a subjective and objective impression of significant time savings. Average operating times for battery replacements were reduced from 37 to 26 minutes (P = 0.015).
   CONCLUSION: In our experience, the PlasmaBlade is safe to use in revising/replacing neuromodulation implants. We observed no damage or transmission of energy to the implants or leads; additional advantages of the system include reduced operating times, less damage to surrounding tissue, and the potential to facilitate revision procedures in awake patients under local anesthesia.

TI Tumefactive Multiple Sclerosis Masquerading as High Grade Glioma
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Autoimmune; Demyelination; Glioma; Neurology; Neurosurgery; Oncology;
   Pseudotumor
AB Tumefactive multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating lesion that can radiographically mimic high-grade gliomas during acute episodes, thus affecting clinical decision making. A delay in appropriate diagnoses can result in unnecessary invasive resections. The following case is a patient with unilateral weakness and radiologic findings that were concerning for a high-grade glioma. Peripheral studies were equivocal. The decision was made to proceed with a stereotactic biopsy, yielding a definitive diagnosis of tumefactive demyelinating lesion (TDL). The patient responded robustly to medical management and made a full clinical recovery. While TDLs and gliomas may look radiologically identical during acute demyelinating episodes, unlike gliomas, TDLs will demonstrate evolvement over serial imaging and robust clinical response to high dose steroids. Clinicians should proceed with caution when considering invasive procedures with such lesions. Conservative medical management is often sufficient as seen in this patient. This case highlights the importance of timely diagnosis and management of TDLs.

AB BACKGROUND: Branching and/or replication of the abducens nerve is not an uncommon occurrence. Although numerous variations have been documented, the rarest forms are duplicated or triplicated nerves, where multiple nerve roots originate from the brainstem, travel intracranially, and attach to the lateral rectus as separate entities.
   METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search on the topic of supernumerary abducens nerve, using PubMed and Google Scholar.
   RESULTS: After screening, 16 studies were included: 11 cadaveric studies and 6 case reports.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we review the literature on variations found, discuss current hypotheses and clinical relevance, and propose future studies. Neurosurgeons should be aware of such nerve variants when viewing imaging or operating in the regions traversed by the abducens nerve.

   EXPERIENCE; HEMORRHAGE; PLACEMENT; OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND: Nontraumatic carotid artery injury with active extravasation, or carotid blowout syndrome (CBS), is relatively rare and highly difficult to treat because it is difficult to approach the lesions owing to anatomic factors. It also involves quick progression and a risk of cerebral embolization caused by thrombi and carotid artery occlusion. Recently, covered stents were revealed to be effective for CBS. However, they have several disadvantages, such as their costs, rebleeding complications, or cerebral embolic risks. A firm selection method of CBS types that are appropriate for covered-stent therapy is expected.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 38-year-old man with esophageal cancer presented with massive hematemesis. Computed tomography revealed active extravasation from the left common carotid artery with medial projection. Initially, the open direct approach failed, which resulted in further bleeding and transient cardiopulmonary arrest. With tentative hemostasis using manual finger compression, emergency angiography was performed, and a covered stent, Fluency 8 mm x 60 mm, was placed at the rupture point. He was transferred to the rehabilitation hospital 36 days after admission with a modified Rankin score of 2 without major complications.
   CONCLUSION: CBS cases having rupture points around the clavicle and having medial projection extravasation should be treated by covered stent placement under tentative hemostasis using manual finger pressure rather than conventional open surgical treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: Endoscopic surgery has been successfully applied in treatment of degenerative spinal disease, but few studies have assessed its use in treating sacral metastasis. We report a successful full endoscopic interlaminar approach for sacral nerve root decompression of a sacral metastatic tumor.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 80-year-old man with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma presented with buttock pain with radiation to the right lower leg for 1 week. There was also decreased muscle power of the right lower extremity. Lumbosacral magnetic resonance imaging revealed metastasis of the sacral spine and right iliac bone with S1 exiting nerve root compression. S1 nerve root decompression via a full endoscopic interlaminar approach under local anesthesia was performed. Under fluorescence guidance, a working sleeve with a beveled opening was placed in the interlaminar space of L5-S1. We entered the sacral canal and identified the S1 exiting nerve root. A laminotomy was performed from the internal edge of the right sacral laminae toward the lateral recess. During decompression of the nerve root, buttock and leg pain improved gradually. There was almost complete resolution of leg pain after surgery, and the patient recovered the ability to walk. Visual analog scale score for pain decreased from 8 to 2 after 3 months of follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: For patients with sacral metastasis without spinal instability or difficulty lying in prone position under local anesthesia, the full endoscopic interlaminar approach for nerve root decompression of sacral metastasis may be a suitable method.

   EPIDEMIOLOGY; DIAGNOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Benign meningiomas constitute 80%-90% of all meningiomas and represent the most common type of central nervous system tumor in adults. The vast majority of meningiomas are minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic early in their onset and thereby can often result in delayed diagnosis. Early diagnosis of meningioma is critical, as it can maximize treatment options and improve outcomes and survival. Although seizures and focal neurologic deficits are considered to be the most prevalent symptoms, depression also may be an important and significant sign. A subtle neurologic depression may be an even early presenting sign of meningioma and may precede more traditional presenting symptoms.
   METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature review that analyzes the results of prospective studies and case reports on this topic.
   RESULTS: Our findings show evidence to suggest that depression may be correlated with meningioma presentation. Its prevalence is possibly increased with an anterior location of the tumor.
   CONCLUSIONS: For patients who exhibit nuances of depression without a history of psychiatric illness, an index of suspicion for meningioma may be warranted.

   Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Basal interhemispheric; Clipping; Distal anterior cerebral artery
   aneurysm; Minimally invasive; Supraorbital keyhole
ID SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE
AB BACKGROUND: The minimally invasive approach to distal anterior cerebral artery (DACA) aneurysms has not gained much acceptance due to difficulties associated with the conventional frontal paramedian approach. The more proximal basal interhemispheric approach, however, necessitates extensive dissection of soft tissues. We describe a novel minimally invasive median supraorbital keyhole craniotomy with a basal interhemispheric approach for clipping a ruptured DACA aneurysm.
   METHODS: A 62-year-old patient presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Computed tomography angiography revealed a DACA aneurysm. The surgical technique involved a keyhole craniotomy made via an eyebrow incision extending between the supraorbital notches, and flush with the anterior cranial fossa. The dura was opened at the anterior part, the falx was cut, an interhemispheric dissection was carried out, adequate proximal control was obtained, and the aneurysm neck was dissected and clipped. A relevant review of the literature was carried out.
   RESULTS: The patient recovered well, with no residual aneurysm or forehead numbness, with good cosmesis. Compared with the previously described "keyhole unilateral interhemispheric" approaches, our technique has less likelihood of encountering bridging veins; easier cisternal cerebrospinal fluid release, making it feasible even in swollen brain; better proximal vascular control; and trajectory toward the neck rather than dome.
   CONCLUSION: The median supraorbital keyhole approach is a minimally invasive technique sufficient for clipping most DACA aneurysms, with easier access, better proximal control, and good cosmesis.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Focal hydrocephalus; Neuroendoscopy; Trapped temporal horn
ID ENTRAPMENT; VENTRICULOCISTERNOSTOMY
AB BACKGROUND: The postoperative ventricular adhesion after resection of central nervous system tumors can obstruct physiologic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation and cause temporal horn entrapment. The surgical goal is to restore physiologic flow of CSF. The authors reviewed their database to report their experience with endoscopic fenestration for treating entrapped temporal horn caused by atrial adhesions. All endoscopic operations performed from February 2015 to December 2016 were reviewed.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Three patients developed temporal horn entrapment after tumor resection Fenestration was successful in all patients, with a subsequent stomy of the septum pellucidum. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging 1 year later showed a patent reduction of the entrapped horn.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic fenestration is an option in the treatment of entrapped temporal horns. However, more experience is required to recommend it as the treatment of choice.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety in the management of lumbar diseases performed by either posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) or transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF). Interbody fusion is considered the "gold standard" in the treatment of lumbar degenerative diseases. Both PLIF and TLIF have been advocated, and it remains controversial as to the best operative technique.
   METHODS: The electronic databases including Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane library were searched to identify relevant studies up to September 2017. The primary outcomes were fusion rate, complications, and clinical satisfaction. The secondary outcomes were length of hospitalization, operation time, blood loss, postoperative visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and Japanese Orthopaedic Association Score. Data analysis was conducted with RevMan 5.3 software.
   RESULTS: A total of 16 studies involving 1502 patients (805 patients in PLIF group and 697 in TLIF group) were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis showed that there was no significant difference in terms of fusion rate (P > 0.05) and clinical satisfaction (P > 0.05) between the 2 groups. TLIF was superior to PLIF with significantly lower incidence of nerve root injury (P < 0.05) and dural tear (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference regarding wound infection (P > 0.05) and graft malposition (P > 0.05). PLIF required significant longer operation time (P < 0.05) and was associated with more blood loss (P < 0.05). Although TLIF was associated with better postoperative visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and Japanese Orthopaedic Association Score than PLIF, there was no statistical difference regarding these results.
   CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests that both TLIF and PLIF could achieve similar clinical satisfaction and fusion rate in the management of degenerative lumbar diseases. However, TLIF was superior to PLIF with shorter operation time, less blood loss, and lower incidence of nerve root injury and dural tear. There is no significant difference between both groups regarding wound infection and graft malposition.

   SURGERY; MODEL; BONE; OSSEOINTEGRATION; INTEGRATION; TEMPLATES; SURFACES
AB BACKGROUND: Spine surgery has the potential to benefit from additive manufacturing/3-dimensional printing (3DP) technology with complex anatomical pathologies requiring reconstruction, with the potential to customize surgery to reduce operative times, reduce blood loss, provide immediate stability, and potentially improve fusion rates. We report a unique case of intraoperative trial placement of a custom patient-specific implant (PSI) versus the final implantation of a customizable off-the-shelf (OTS) implant. Data collected for comparison included time to implant, ease of implantation, firmness of press-fit, and fixation options after implantation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 64-year-old man presented with low back pain. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a solitary lesion in the L5 vertebral body, confirmed by positron emission tomography scan. Removal of the L5 vertebral body was performed, and reconstruction was achieved with an expandable cage. The time of implant insertion was minimal with the PSI (90 seconds) versus the OTS (>40 minutes). Immediate press-fit and "firmness" of implantation was clearly superior with the PSI, although this was an intraoperative subjective assessment. Other benefits include integral fixation that is predetermined with the PSI, reduced time and blood loss, and ease of bone grafting with a PSI.
   CONCLUSIONS: Use of 3DP has been able to reduce operative time significantly. Surgeons can train before performing complex procedures, which enhances their presurgical planning, with the goal to maximize patient outcomes. When considering implants and prostheses, the use of 3DP allows a superior anatomical fit for the patient, with the potential to improve restoration of anatomy.

AB In neurosurgery, extracranial-to-intracranial EC-IC) bypass surgery is necessary for patients who have undergone surgery in which the superficial temporal artery (STA) was already used for a different bypass procedure or was damaged. Here we report our experience with EC-IC bypass using the occipital artery MA) in patients in whom the STA was unavailable, and discuss the technical considerations and pitfalls. Five patients with ischemic-onset moyamoya disease and atherosclerotic disease were included. Two patterns of skin incisions were planned according to the OA pathway and recipient artery location. In one of these methods, a skin incision is made above the OA, and a craniotomy is performed under this incision after OA dissection. In the other method, a skin incision is made above the OA to enable its dissection, and a craniotomy is performed via a separate skin incision. No major perioperative complications developed in any of the 5 cases, and bypass patency was confirmed in all patients. There was a significant difference between the preoperative and postoperative asymmetry ratios of the mean transit time values. Our findings suggest that OA-to-middle cerebral artery (MCA) bypass is a simple and effective technique in patients in whom the STA was already used or was damaged by previous intracranial revascularization or craniotomy. This procedure could be an alternative to STA-MCA bypass in patients without an available STA.

TI Making Anatomic Preparations of the Human Brain Using Colored Silicone

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Anatomic preparations of the human brain; Colored silicone
ID INJECTION; FRESH
AB BACKGROUND: A thorough understanding of the central nervous system anatomy is a fundamental part of a neurosurgeon's training. Development of novel neurosurgical approaches and optimization of existing ones directly depend on the comprehensive study of topographic anatomy of the head and neck using cadaveric specimens. Staining the vessels of the arterial and venous systems of a cadaveric specimen aids a detailed study of the vascularization of anatomic structures of the brain. Here we describe an alternative expedited method for creating anatomic preparations of the human brain using colored silicone for vascular perfusion staining.
   METHODS: A nonfixed, whole cadaver (with the head intact), without central nervous system pathology, no later than 48 hours after death, is used to prepare the human brain specimen through staining of arterial and venous vessels.
   RESULTS: Our proposed method provides a fast and inexpensive approach to making anatomic preparations of the human brain with staining of the vascular system. The preparations thus obtained can be used for educational purposes, aiding the study of normal and topographic anatomy of the brain, as well as the development of new microsurgical and/or endoscopic approaches.
   CONCLUSIONS: In experienced hands, our proposed method allows the creation of anatomic preparations relatively fast, at low cost, and with excellent quality.

ID SKULL BASE; CAVERNOUS SINUS; MENINGIOMAS; RESECTION; OUTCOMES
AB OBJECTIVE: Middle fossa floor access can be challenging. Open skull base approaches have associated morbidity and yield suboptimal working angles around the temporal lobe. Endoscopic endonasal approaches to the middle fossa are poorly described, but provide an improved angle. I hypothesized that the length of the maxillary nerve can be transposed out of the foramen rotundum to provide a path to expose the full width of the middle fossa floor through the anterolateral and anteromedial triangle.
   METHODS: Endoscopic endonasal transpterygoid dis-ctions to expose the middle fossa were performed bilaterally on 2 silicone-injected cadaveric heads (4 sides). Transposition of V2 was then performed on all sides, and additional middle fossa exposure was achieved. High-resolution computed tomography imaging was obtained to quantify the extent of exposure. A transzygomatic approach was also performed for comparison.
   RESULTS: The maxillary nerve was successfully transr- ,ed in each dissection. A periosteal fold was identified to assist in the mobilization of the infraorbital nerve. The average middle fossa exposure achieved without transposition was 50% (of the medial to lateral width). Transposition increased that to 95%. Comparison with the open transzygomatic approach demonstrated superior surgical trajectory (inferior to superior) with the endonasal route.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic endonasal transpterygoid approaches with or without transposition of the maxillary nerve provide a reasonable option for sequentially exposing the entire medial to lateral extent of the anterolateral triangle. It provides an advantageous inferior to superior surgical angle and can be considered for treatment of select middle fossa floor pathology.

AB BACKGROUND: Penetrating brain injury (PBI) caused by a nail gun is an extremely rare neurosurgical emergency that poses a challenge for neurosurgeons because of its rarity and complexity.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we present 3 cases of PBI caused by a nail gun. In the first case, the nail entered through the right parietal bone and lodged in the right parietal lobe and basal ganglia. In the second case, the nail entered through the right occipital bone and lodged in the right occipital lobe. In the third case, the nail entered through the right parietal bone and lodged in the right frontal and parietal lobes. All patients underwent surgical removal of the nail. The first patient presented with reduced left-side strength, whereas the second and third patients were neurologically intact on presentation.
   CONCLUSIONS: PBI caused by a nail gun can present with differing clinical manifestations, and most cases require immediate surgery. A rational management strategy should provide a good postoperative prognosis with minimal neurologic deficits in these patients.

ID NEUROSURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Similar to most of the other medical and surgical fields, neurosurgery has changed drastically in recent decades, especially in instrumentation and equipment. Safety, scope of treating initially considered nontreatable neurosurgical conditions, and prognosis of most neurosurgical procedures have improved significantly. Newer instruments and equipments are being introduced exponentially, leading to tremendous cost escalation of neurosurgical treatment. However, equitable distribution of neurosurgical services in society is far from reality. We need to look back and learn from our teachers and forefathers of neurosurgery their innovative ways to accomplish difficult procedures without advanced tools and techniques. Microneurosurgery is considered a highly skilled technique, and instruments used for it are delicate, precise, and costlier than similar instruments for macroneurosurgery.
   TECHNIQUE AND CONCLUSION: Frugal innovative techniques and tools are presented for making stainless steel wire and plate microdissectors that are effective for microneurosurgical procedures and can be helpful for neurosurgeons working in resource-poor settings.

AB BACKGROUND: Epidermoid tumors are rare, benign slow-growing congenital tumors, most frequently located in the cerebellopontine angle of the intracranial cavity. They usually grow to a large size before patients become symptomatic. Although these tumors are amenable to surgery, their adherence to neuro-vascular structures poses a surgical challenge that results in subtotal resection, thus increasing the risk of recurrence.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report 2 adult patients whose imaging studies revealed epidermoid tumors located in the cerebellar vermis, an uncommon site for such tumors. The patients presented with variable symptomatology. We highlight the imaging features and challenges of surgery. Both patients had good outcomes, with resolution of symptoms and neurologic deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: A safe complete excision of epidermoid tumor and its capsule is possible with a good understanding of their clinical and radiologic features and a high index of suspicion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of cerebellar vermian epidermoid tumors from sub-Saharan Africa.

AB BACKGROUND: Pseudoaneurysms are less common than true aneurysms. Herein, we present a rare case of a mass of the right posterior ascending artery.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This was identified during routine dissection of an adult female cadaver. Histology demonstrated that the mass was a pseudoaneurysm. The mass was located posterior to the right alar ligament superior to the right portion of the transverse ligament and measured 7.37 mm and 2.97 mm.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, such a case has not previously been reported. Epidural masses anterior to the cervical dura mater at the craniocervical junction should consider such a pathology in the differential diagnosis.

AB Craniectomy is a frequently performed neurosurgical procedure, and coverage of the cranial defect is necessary for protection of the underlying brain, cosmesis, and patient satisfaction. We report a new technique for intraoperative in situ synthetic cranioplasty that provides one-step resection of skull osteomas and reconstruction of cranial defects. Strategies of intraoperative cranioplasty are reviewed. A 48-year-old man who presented with a suspected benign osteoma over his forehead was offered surgical excision and primary cranioplasty in a one-step procedure using hydroxyapatite bone cement, a dural prosthetic, and a resorbable plate. Following craniectomy around the lesion, there was evidence of dural and bone involvement. The craniectomy was enlarged, and the involved dura was resected. SYNTHECEL dura repair was used to repair the dural defect and at the same time fashioned to form a receptacle for the cranioplasty by fixation of the dural substrate to the cut vertical bone edges. DirectInject hydroxyapatite bone cement was used to fill the receptacle and contoured to the curvature of the adjacent skull. A Delta resorbable plate was then placed over the bone cement and fixed to the skull. This technique provided a satisfactory cosmetic outcome following craniectomy for benign skull tumor excision. When possible, one-step surgery with primary cranioplasty should be considered.

   FEATURES
AB BACKGROUND: Neurocytoma is a rare brain neoplasm of neuroepithelial origin that occurs predominantly in the ventricular system adjacent to the interventricular foramen and septum pellucidum. However, extraventricular neurocytoma is an extremely rare entity, with poor clinical, radiologic, and histopathological characterization. Here we report a case of an extraventricular parafalcine neurocytoma in the left frontal lobe. We also examine previously reported cases of extraventricular neurocytoma in an attempt to provide an up-to-date summary of the condition.
   METHODS: A literature search was performed using PubMed with specific key terms, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria. Selected case studies and case series were then compared, and statistical analyses were performed where appropriate. We report a 59-year-old woman presenting with weakness in her right leg and urinary incontinence. Physical examination revealed muscle strength of grade 3/5 in the right lower extremity. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a parafalcine mass in the left frontal lobe, with perilesional edema; the cerebral falx and lateral ventricle were shifted due to the compression. Gross total resection was performed.
   RESULTS: Histopathological examination revealed a neurocytoma. Immunohistochemical staining showed diffuse positivity for synaptophysin. MIB-1 staining for Ki-67 antibody showed a labeling index of 20%. No adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy was administered. Brain computed tomography performed at a 3-month follow-up showed no signs of recurrence.
   CONCLUSION: Extraventricular neurocytoma occurring in the brain parenchyma is a very rare central nervous system tumor. Its clinical and radiologic manifestations are nonspecific. The diagnosis depends on histopathological and immunohistochemical examination. Surgical resection should be the first-choice treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: Brain abscesses are well-known to neurologic surgeons with well-recognized presentations, which include seizures, neurologic deficit, and headache. Rare symptoms may lead to a delay in diagnosis, which can be life threatening in the setting of a brain abscess.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a 46-year-old male with intractable hiccups found to have an abscess of the right basal ganglia. The brain abscess was treated by frameless stereotactic-guided aspiration. The patient's hiccups improved after surgical aspiration and medical management.
   CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive literature review confirmed brain abscess as a rare cause of intractable hiccups. In addition, there are few reports of lesions of the basal ganglia causing intractable hiccups. Aspiration and medical therapy resulted in resolution of the hiccups. Knowledge of the hiccup reflex arc and unusual presentation of basal ganglia lesions may shorten time to diagnosis.

AB Vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging (VW-MRI) is a modern imaging technique with expanding applications in the characterization of intracranial vessel wall pathology. VW-MRI provides added diagnostic capacity compared with conventional luminal imaging methods. This review explores the principles of VW-MRI and typical imaging features of various vessel wall pathologies, such as atherosclerosis, dissection, and vasculitis. Radiologists should be familiar with this important imaging technique, given its increasing use and future relevance to everyday practice.

   EXPANDING LACUNAE; CEREBRAL LACUNAE; BRAIN-STEM; DILATATION; PRESSURE;
   DISEASE; CYSTS
AB BACKGROUND: Perivascular spaces (PVS), also known as Virchowe-Robin spaces, are pial-lined, interstitial fluid-filled structures in the brain that accompany cerebral vessels as they penetrate the cerebral substance. In healthy individuals, a PVS diameter of <2 mm is considered normal and can typically be seen within the white matter on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). When PVS dilate, they are considered benign lesions and are associated with aging and other risk factors. These dilated PVS can cause neurologic symptoms, depending on their size and location. Symptomatic, massive enlargement of PVS are referred to as "giant" or "tumefactive" PVS; these are extremely rare and require neurosurgical intervention.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a rare case of giant tumefactive PVS (GTPVS) associated with hydrocephalus in a female patient who presented with progressive headache for 6 months. The patient was found to have giant tumefactive dilatation of PVS involving the right midbrain, with extension to the pons and thalamus, and with supratentorial moderate hydrocephalus. She was treated with cerebrospinal fluid diversion alone.
   CONCLUSIONS: PVS are found on MRI in healthy people; rarely, they may dilate and cause neurologic symptoms. GTPVS are rare and can be mis-diagnosed as central nervous system tumors; however, their imaging characteristics facilitate diagnosis. It has been postulated that these expanding PVS are due to defects in the drainage of interstitial fluid, where it enters into the ventricular system, and they are not the result of increased intraventricular pressure. We hypothesize that this may have been the case for the patient in our study, as the GTPVS collapsed following the insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. However, more recent literature provides evidence to support the idea that hydrocephalus is the consequence, and not the cause, of aqueduct compression by the lesion.

   cord syndrome
ID SURGICAL-MANAGEMENT; MALFORMATION; SYMPTOMS; SURGERY; SYRINX
AB BACKGROUND: Adult tethered cord syndrome is a rare neurologic disorder that classically presents with back or leg pain, weakness, and urinary dysfunction. Spinal cord tethering has been associated with acquired Chiari malformations. Whereas the effects of tethered cord release on Chiari malformation symptoms have been described previously, we report an unusual case of acquired tethered cord syndrome following Chiari decompression.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a 68-year-old man with a history of distant T12-level spinal cord injury and 2 weeks of progressive bilateral lower extremity weakness. The patient underwent a T12-L1 laminectomy in 1977, complicated by arachnoiditis and syringomyelia, with eventual placement of a syringopleural shunt. He remained neurologically stable until 2012, when he underwent a suboccipital craniectomy for Chiari decompression for new-onset headache and dysphagia. Ten days later, the patient noted progressive leg weakness and radiographic evidence of spinal cord tethering at the T11-T12 level. A T10-L1 laminectomy and medical facetectomy was undertaken for detethering with postoperative recovery of ambulatory function with assistance.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our patient exhibited an unusual acquisition of tethered cord syndrome. The tethering of the spinal cord may have been triggered by arachnoid adhesions from initial lumbar surgery 35 years before presentation and subsequently exacerbated by alterations of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics after Chiari decompression. Given the potentially devastating sequelae of tethered cord syndrome, investigation of cerebrospinal fluid flow dynamics may be beneficial before operative intervention in patients with risk factors for a tethered cord who exhibit adult-onset Chiari malformation.

DT Review
DE Cervical; Epidural hematoma; Manipulation therapy; Massage
ID MANIPULATION THERAPY; CHIROPRACTIC MANIPULATION; PATIENT
AB BACKGROUND: Most people understand spinal manipulation therapy to be a safe procedure, and in many cases treatment is provided without a diagnosis if there is musculoskeletal pain. Cervical epidural hematoma occurs in extremely rare cases after cervical manipulation therapy. This study reports a case of epidural hematoma that occurred in the anterior spinal cord after cervical massage.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 38-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency department for sudden weakness in the lower extremity after receiving a cervical spine massage. No fracture was found using cervical radiographs, and there were no particular findings on performing brain computed tomography or diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. However, using cervical magnetic resonance imaging, an acute epidural hematoma was observed in the anterior spinal cord from the C6 and C7 vertebrae to the T1 vertebra, compressing the spinal cord. There were no fractures or ligament injury. No surgical treatment was required as the patient showed spontaneous improvements in muscle strength and was discharged after just 1 week, following observation of the improvement in his symptoms.
   CONCLUSION: Although cervical epidural hematoma after cervical manipulation therapy is extremely rare, if suspected, a thorough examination must be performed in order to reduce the chances of serious neurologic sequelae.

AB BACKGROUND: Although benign trigeminal schwannomas are uncommon, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) of the trigeminal nerve are extraordinarily rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old female presented with a 2-month-long history of numbness of the right face and progressive weakness of the left limbs. Preoperative neuroimages indicated a giant tumor involving the middle and posterior cranial fossa with similar radiologic characteristics to benign trigeminal schwannomas. However, historithologic and immunochemical examinations confirmed the tumor to be an MMST. A nearly gross total resection was obtained with a combined frontotemporal extradural and subtemporal anterior petrosal approach. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient received adjuvant radiotherapy subsequently. There was no recurrence of the tumor with a 6-month-long follow-up.
   CONCLUSION: MPNSTs of the trigeminal nerve are exceedingly rare. This study described the 21st case of MPNSTs of the trigeminal nerve. MPNSTs of the trigeminal nerve showed similar radiologic characteristics to benign trigeminal schwannomas, and accurate diagnosis depended on pathologic and immuno-chemical examinations. Gross total resection followed by radiotherapy is the usual treatment.

TI Ectopic Prolactinoma Presenting as Bacterial Meningitis: A Diagnostic
   Conundrum

LA English
DT Article
DE Cerebrospinal fluid leak; Ectopic pituitary tumor; Meningitis;
   Nasoseptal flap; Prolactinoma
ID SPHENOID SINUS; CSF RHINORRHEA; PITUITARY; MACROPROLACTINOMA
AB BACKGROUND: Prolactinomas may rarely present with meningitis and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea secondary to erosion of the wall of the sella turcica. It is even more uncommon for this abnormal communication to be caused by an ectopic prolactinoma arising from the sphenoid sinus and eroding into the sella. This atypical growth pattern makes diagnosis very difficult because there may be no displacement of the normal pituitary gland. The first reported case of a patient with an ectopic prolactinoma originating within the sphenoid sinus presenting primarily with meningitis is presented, and the management strategy and surgical and nonsurgical treatment options are discussed.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 48-year-old woman presented with confusion, low-pressure headache, and fever. A lumbar puncture revealed Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, and she was placed on intravenous penicillin G. After initiation of antibiotics, she noticed salty tasting postnasal fluid leakage. Imaging was remarkable for bony erosion of the sphenoid sinus wall by a soft tissue mass growing from within the sinus, with no disruption of the normal pituitary gland. A biopsy was then performed with an endoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal approach, and the CSF leak was repaired with a pedicled nasoseptal flap. The final pathology was prolactinoma, and she was placed on cabergoline.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ectopic prolactinomas may rarely present as meningitis secondary to retrograde transmission of bacteria through a bony defect in the sphenoid sinus, and must be included in the differential diagnosis of any sphenoid sinus mass. Management should first address the infection, followed by surgical repair of the bony defect.

DE Elderly; Osteoblastoma; Osteoma osteoid; Spinal; Spinal tumor
ID MOBILE SPINE; TREATMENT OPTIONS; OSTEOID-OSTEOMA
AB BACKGROUND: Osteoblastoma is a benign bone-forming tumor, sometimes locally invasive, that may involve any bone. The highest incidence is between 20 and 30 years of age, and there are no cases described in the elderly.
   METHODS: We report a case of an elderly patient with a lesion in the lumbar spine in which osteoblastoma diagnosis was made.
   CONCLUSIONS: Osteoblastoma is a rare tumor older than 50 years of age, but it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of bone lesions of the spine in adulthood and in the elderly, to avoid a delay in the treatment.

DT Article
DE Compartment syndrome; Intraoperative neuromonitoring; Motor evoked
   potentials; Somatosensory evoked potentials
ID EXTREMITY; DIAGNOSIS; SURGERY; THERAPY; TRAUMA
AB BACKGROUND: The use of intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring (IOM) has become commonplace in many neurosurgical procedures as a tool to reduce the risk of complications through the early identification of reversible neurologic compromise. Although complications related to IOM itself are exceedingly rare, recognizing their clinical presentation in the postoperative neurosurgical patient is essential for the early identification and implementation of appropriate treatment.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The authors present a case report of a patient who developed postoperative acute compartment syndrome in the right arm after placement of neuromonitoring needles for routine IOM during endovascular treatment of a left internal carotid artery aneurysm. Before the procedure, the patient received dual antiplatelet therapy and was noted to have a P2Y12 reaction unit value within therapeutic range. The patient had not received other anticoagulation therapy and had no family or personal history of hematologic or coagulopathic disorders. Immediately after an uncomplicated endovascular intervention, the patient began to develop symptoms of forearm swelling, tightness, and tenderness to palpation; pain with wrist flexion and extension; and paresthesias of the distal digits of the hand. She had eventual loss of a palpable radial pulse. The patient underwent emergent fasciotomies of multiple forearm compartments and had immediate return of a palpable radial pulse.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case represents the first report of post-procedural compartment syndrome resulting from placement of neuromonitoring needles for routine IOM. Although it is a particularly rare complication of IOM, compartment syndrome represents a surgical emergency that carries significant morbidity if not immediately recognized and treated.

AB BACKGROUND: Prolactinomas are typically treated nonsurgically with a dopamine agonist. Once the tumor shrinks, adjacent eloquent structures, such as the optic apparatus, can become skeletonized and herniate into the dilated parasellar space.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 48-year-old man with a prolactin-secreting macro-adenoma treated with cabergoline presented with progressive bitemporal hemianopsia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed no recurrence of disease and a stretched optic chiasm herniating into an empty sella. Elevation of the optic chiasm via a transnasal transsphenoidal approach with ALLODERM graft and septal cartilage strut was performed. The patient was discharged home the next day with significant improvement in vision; magnetic resonance imaging showed interval elevation of the optic chiasm.
   CONCLUSIONS: We review secondary empty sella syndrome and discuss surgical strategies for optic chiasmapexy.

The classic imaging finding on a noncontrast head computed tomography is multiple small areas of hyperdensity within the cerebral hemispheres, which represent lipiodol deposition in the brain. We report a case of lipiodol deposition in the middle cerebral artery following lymphatic embolization, producing an "ultradense" vessel sign on noncontrast computed tomography.

AB BACKGROUND: Epithelioid glioblastoma, a high-grade, diffuse astrocytic tumor variant, comprises closely packed epithelioid cells and rhabdoid cells. This rare tumor usually develops in the cerebral cortex and diencephalon; however, in the case reported here, it was located intraventricularly.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 47-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with a right intraventricular mass that had rapidly increased in size. On discovery of the tumor 3 years earlier at the referring hospital, the mass was small, calcified, and attached to the periventricular parenchyma. Over the next 2 years, the mass grew slowly, as observed on periodic magnetic resonance imaging scans. Forty days before the referral, the patient experienced headache and nausea, and marked growth and intratumoral hemorrhage were visible on a computed tomography scan of the head. The tumor was partially removed via a superior parietal lobule corticotomy. Histopathological examination confirmed an isocitrate dehydrogenase-wild-type epithelioid glioblastoma with a BRAF V600E mutation, but the original slow-growing lesion was no longer detected. Consequently, we assume that in this case, a low-grade glioma transformed into an aggressively malignant epithelioid glioblastoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present the first case of an intraventricular epithelioid glioblastoma that might have arisen from a low-grade glioma with calcification. We recommend including this tumor variant in the differential diagnosis of lateral ventricle tumors.

   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a spontaneous spinal epidural .atoma occurring in a patient under treatment with dabigatran, a non- vitamin K oral anticoagulant. The initial hemiparesis symptom was misleading and was retrospectively identified as Brown-Sequard syndrome. Immediate dabigatran antagonism with idarucizumab followed by posterior cervical laminectomy permitted a complete neurologic recovery at day 4.

AB INTRODUCTION: Treatment options for hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) include microvascular surgery, stereotactic radiofrequency thermocoagulation (SRT), laser interstitial thermal therapy, or Gamma Knife surgery. During SRT, thermographic monitoring cannot be performed and therefore highly accurate placement of electrode and confirmation of its position are required. We have used robotic guidance (ROSA) and coregistered it with O-arm for performing ablation of hamartoma.
   METHODS: Five patients with HH and gelastic seizures underwent SRT. Robotic guidance (ROSA) was used for placement of electrodes. An O-arm was used for coregistering and confirming the robotic trajectory with realtime intraoperative imaging. Intraoperative computed tomography was merged with preoperative magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the exact position and trajectory of the electrode. Ablation was performed using a radiofrequency generator (70 degrees C for 60 seconds). Multiple target sites were ablated to achieve proper ablation and disconnection.
   RESULTS: Most patients (4/5) had International League Against Epilepsy class I outcome. One patient 2 sittings of lesioning. All but 1 electrode could be placed in the planned trajectories. One electrode was detected to have a medial deviation, and it had to be revised. No permanent complication was observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: SRT is a cost-effective method of treating HH when compared with laser interstitial thermal therapy. With the use of a robotic arm we have demonstrated accurate placement of electrodes. Intraoperative computed tomography acquired using an O-arm can be merged with preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. This confirms electrode location and trajectory on a realtime basis by performing intraoperative imaging. This method is safe and can be used for radiofrequency ablation of HH.

   FUTILITY
AB BACKGROUND: Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) detected on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be useful to predict outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI).
   METHODS: This study compared the ability of the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials (IMPACT) prognostic model with DAI on MRI to predict the 18-month neurologic outcome in 56 patients who had required decompressive craniectomy after TBI.
   RESULTS: Of the 56 patients included in the study (19 scans occurred within 14 days; median time for all patients 24 days, interquartile range 14-42), 18 (32%) had evidence of DAI on the MRI scans. The presence of DAI on the MRI diffusion-weighted (DW) T2*-weighted gradient echo and susceptibility-weighted (SWI) sequences was associated with an increased risk of unfavorable outcome at 18 months compared with patients without DAI (44% vs. 17%, difference = 27%, 95% confidence interval 2.4-46.7%; P = 0.032), particularly when the brainstem was involved. However, neither the grading (I to IV) nor the number of brain regions with DAI was as good as the IMPACT model in discriminating between patients with unfavorable and favorable outcomes (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.625 and 0.621 vs. 0.918, respectively; P < 0.001 for both comparisons). After adjustment for the IMPACT prognostic risks, DAI in different brain regions and the grading of DAI were also not independently associated with unfavorable outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic significance of DAI on MRI may, in part, be captured by the IMPACT prognostic model. More research is needed before MRI should be routinely used to prognosticate the outcomes in patients with TBI requiring decompressive craniectomy.

TI Surgical Drains in Chronic Subdural Hematoma Surgery: From the Cheapest
   to the Most Expensive Drains
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Bur hole drainage; Chronic subdural hematoma; Surgeon-made drains
AB OBJECTIVE: Among the various neurosurgical techniques currrently being used in chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) surgery, bur hole craniostomy is the most popular worldwide. Recent studies have strongly recommended that a drain be placed after surgical evacuation of a hematoma, and a broad spectrum of preformed surgical drains is widely available for this purpose. If preformed drains are unavailable, a surgeon-made drain can be used and various methods are available to develop a drain in the operating room.
   METHODS: Using a case report, we demonstrate how to develop a surgeon-made drain. Next, we retrospectively screened for subdural drain usage in consecutive patients undergoing bur hole drainage for CSDH at Adiyaman University Hospital between January 2017 and April 2017, and data from only those patients in whom a surgeon-made drain was used were included for analyses.
   RESULTS: A 74-year-old male was operated with the diagnosis of CSDH. Assembly of a surgeon-made drain was explained step by step. Our review identified 6 unilateral and 2 bilateral cases in which 10 surgeon-made drains were used. Mean age of the patients was 72, and mean follow-up period was 7 months, 23 days. No instances of infection or drain-related complications had been recorded. The recurrence rate was 0%, and the average drainage period was 3.4 days.
   CONCLUSIONS: In case of unavailability of a preformed drain a surgeon-made drain can be used during CSDH surgery. Different methods are available and can be further diversified using various combinations of simple medical materials.

TI Local Spinal Cord Decompression Through a Full Endoscopic Percutaneous
   Transcorporeal Approach for Cervicothoracic Ossification of the
   Posterior Longitudinal Ligament at the T1-T2 Level

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe a percutaneous full endoscopic transcorporeal procedure to excise local ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) lesions and decompress the spinal cord at the cervicothoracic transitional segment is safe and effective with respect to surgical complications.
   METHODS: A 67-year-old woman presented with nuchal pain and numbness below the T2 dermatome for 3 months and a 2-week history of paraplegia. T1-T2 myelopathy and paraplegia caused by OPLL was diagnosed based on clinical presentation, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. An anterior percutaneous full endoscopic transcorporeal procedure addressed local OPLL and achieved local spinal cord decompression at T1-T2. After surgery, magnetic resonance imaging was repeated to evaluate degree of spinal cord decompression. Visual analog scale, Neck Disability Index, and Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores were evaluated at each follow-up.
   RESULTS: The patient tolerated the full endoscopic operation successfully. Operative time was 225 minutes. On postoperative day 6, muscle strength of the bilateral lower extremities had progressed from grade 0/5 preoperatively to grade 2 /5 on the right and grade 2+/5 on the left. No surgery-related complications were discovered.
   CONCLUSIONS: The percutaneous full endoscopic transcorporeal procedure is an alternative to previously described surgical methods of local spinal cord decompression for T1-T2 OPLL with fewer complications, effective spinal cord decompression, and a satisfactory cosmetic result. Successful cases confirm that treatment of spinal cord-limited compression by endoscopic technology is feasible.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate primary causes of death after spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and externally validate the HAIR score, a prognostication tool, in a single academic institution.
   METHODS: We reviewed all patients with SAH admitted to our neuro-intensive care unit between 2010 and 2016. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality. The HAIR score predictors were Hunt and Hess grade at treatment decision, age, intraventricular hemorrhage, and rebleeding within 24 hours. Validation of the HAIR score was characterized with the receiver operating curve, the area under the curve, and a calibration plot.
   RESULTS: Among 434 patients with SAH, in-hospital mortality was 14.1%. Of the 61 mortalities, 54 (88.5%) had a neurologic cause of death or withdrawal of care and 7 (11.5%) had cardiac death. Median time from SAH to death was 6 days. The main causes of death were effect of the initial hemorrhage (26.2%), rebleeding (23%) and refractory cerebral edema (193%). Factors significantly associated with in-hospital mortality in the multivariate analysis were age, Hunt and Hess grade, and intracerebral hemorrhage. Maximum lumen size was also a significant risk factor after aneurysmal SAH. The HAIR score had a satisfactory discriminative ability, with an area under the curve of 0.89.
   CONCLUSIONS: The in-hospital mortality is lower than in previous reports, attesting to the continuing improvement of our institutional SAH care. The major causes are the same as in previous reports. Despite a different therapeutic protocol, the HAIR score showed good discrimination and could be a useful tool for predicting mortality.

AB INTRODUCTION: Hormonal insufficiency of 1 or more pituitary axes can appear after pituitary surgery. Adrenal axis impairment after surgery can lead to serious consequences if not identified and treated.
   OBJECTIVE: Assess early and late postoperative adrenal insufficiency (Al) and identify the risk factors predicting their occurrence after endoscopic transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenomas.
   METHOD: Retrospective review identified 176 pituitary adenomas resected using an endoscopic transsphenoidal approach. Patients taking steroids preoperatively, Cushing disease patients, and patients with incomplete records were excluded. Sixty-nine patients were excluded according to our exclusion criteria.
   RESULTS: The study group thus included 107 patients (total of 111 operations). The median age was 50 years (range, 18-89 years). The median duration of follow-up was 30 months (range, 6-74 months). Eighty-three patients (74.7%) had macroadenomas, and 89 (59.3%) had nonfunctional adenomas. Of the 111 procedures, 61 patients (55%) had early Al. Of the 61 patients, 48 patients (79%) were not taking steroids in long-term follow-up, and only 13 (21%) required long-term replacement. Sixteen of the patients undergoing 111 procedures (14.4%) had Al on long-term follow-up. Of those 16 patients, 13 were already taking steroids and 3 had new diagnoses of Al. Age, male gender, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks were associated with persistent postoperative Al (P = 0.018, P = 0.001, P = 0.007, respectively).
   CONCLUSION: Hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis insufficiency is common after endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery. Male gender, age greater than 50 years, visual impairment, and intraoperative CSF leak were correlated with late postoperative Al. More than two thirds of patients in whom early Al developed did not require steroids in the long term.

AB BACKGROUND: Postoperative visual recovery in patients with pituitary adenoma can be influenced by the duration of symptoms, age, and tumor volume. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows visualization of white matter structure along with quantitative information. The aims of our study were to predict the visual recovery process in the early and long-term periods and to define the parameters affecting the recovery course.
   METHODS: A total of 200 patients with pituitary macro-adenomas underwent endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery between January 2009 and July 2016. DTI and visual analysis including visual acuity and visual field analyses were performed for these patients at 5 periods, which included 3 years of follow-up. The effects of age, duration of symptoms, and tumor volume on visual recovery were evaluated.
   RESULTS: Mean tumor volume was calculated as 8871 +/- 2758 mm(3) and mean symptom duration was 23.41 +/- 13.72 weeks. Mean age of the patients was 43.8 +/- 18.9 years in the full recovery group and 48.7 +/- 15.1 years in the nonrecovery group. Visual field analysis results on a Humphrey visual chart showed a significant linear strong correlation with fractional anisotropy (FA) values and a reverse strong correlation with mean diffusivity (MD) values on DTI magnetic resonance. DTI FA and MD cutoff values for each group were respectively determined as 0.373 and 1386 (X10(-6) mm(2)/second) for the preoperative period, 0.423 and 1383 (x10(-6) mm(2)/second) for the initial period, 0.428 and 1265 (x10(-6) mm(2)/second) for the early period, 0.432 and 1238 (x10(-6) mm(2)/second) for the intermediate period, and 0.437 and 1198 (x10(-6) mm(2)/second) for the late period.
   CONCLUSIONS: DTI can assess and predict visual recovery after endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery of patients with pituitary macroadenomas causing chiasmal compression. FA values lower than or MD values greater than the cutoff values of the specific period reflect poor prognosis. Tumor volume was found to be the featured parameter that affects visual recovery. The postoperative first year is the most prominent interval evaluating the prognosis of visual recovery.

AB BACKGROUND: Posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) has become a general surgical method for degenerative lumbar diseases. Although many reports have focused on single-level PLIF, few have focused on 2-level PLIF, and no report has covered the fusion status of 2-level PLIF. The purpose of this study is to investigate clinical outcomes and fusion for 2-level PLIF by using a combination of dynamic radiographs and multiplanar-reconstruction computed tomography scans.
   METHODS: This study consisted of 48 consecutive patients who underwent 2-level PLIF for degenerative lumbar diseases. We assessed surgery duration, estimated blood loss, complications, clinical outcomes as measured by the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score, lumbar sagittal alignment as measured on standing lateral radiographs, and fusion status as measured by dynamic radiographs and multiplanar-reconstruction computed tomography. Patients were examined at a follow-up point of 4.8 +/- 2.2 years after surgery. Thirty-eight patients who did not undergo lumbosacral fusion comprised the lumbolumbar group, and 10 patients who underwent lumbosacral fusion comprised the lumbosacral group.
   RESULTS: The mean Japanese Orthopaedic Association score improved from 12.1 to 22.4 points by the final followup examination. Sagittal alignment also was improved. All patients had fusion in the cranial level. Seven patients had nonunion in the caudal level, and the lumbosacral group (40%) had a significantly poorer fusion rate than the lumbolumbar group (97%) did.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical outcomes of 2-level PLIF were satisfactory. The fusion rate at both levels was 85%. All nonunion was observed at the caudal level and concentrated at L5-S level in L4-5-S PLIF.

AB OBJECTIVE: The authors reviewed the treatment of adult patients with congenital intraspinal lipomas with total/ near-total resection and discussed their preoperative characteristics, prognostic factors, and surgical outcomes.
   METHODS: Medical records of 122 adult patients with congenital lumbosacral lipomas undergoing total/neartotal resection were systematically analyzed. The cohort was subdivided into 3 groups depending on symptom onset age: group 1 (<= 5 years, n = 40), group 2 (>5 years but <18 years, n = 33), and group 3 (>18 years, n = 49). Preoperative and postoperative neurologic status were compared between groups and analyzed as a whole.
   RESULTS: The most common symptom was bladder dysfunction (82.0%), followed by constipation (76.2%). At the 3-month follow-up, improvement was noted in most patients presenting with pain (87.2%) and neuropathic ulcers (70.0%). Overall, neurologic status was improved in 73.0% of patients and stabilized in 19.7% of patients. A binary logistic regression model identified shorter preoperative duration (P = 0.013) and preoperative pain (P = 0.005) as independent predictors of postoperative improvement. Neurosurgical complications developed in 16 patients, and wound complications occurred in 2 patients. Two of 3 patients who had recurred symptoms underwent repeated detethering surgery during long-term follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite longer preoperative duration than the pediatric population, adult patients with lumbosacral lipomas can still benefit from total/near-total resection especially regarding pain and foot ulcers, with low surgery-related morbidity. The long-term advantage of resecting additional lipoma in adults remains a point of discussion.

AB BACKGROUND: The foramen of Luschka is a natural aperture between the fourth ventricle and the subarachnoid space at the cerebellopontine angle. Membranous closure of this foramen is referred to as primary obstruction. Available information about this variant and its role in the development of the cysts of the posterior fossa is contradictory.
   METHODS: The macroscopic and histologic features of the obstructed foramina were examined in 61 formalin-fixed human brains (122 foramina). Three rhomboid lips of various sizes with lateral recess were used for comparison. Five postoperative cases of diverticulum of the foramen of Luschka were included in this study, with 1 case presented in detail to illustrate anatomic and histologic findings.
   RESULTS: Primary obstruction was present in 11 of 122 cases. In 1 case, an enlarged rigid pouch with a thick wall was found. The wall of the membrane in primary obstruction and the rhomboid lip were composed of an inner ependymal, a middle glial, and an outer leptomeningeal layer.
   CONCLUSIONS: The rhomboid lip is a remnant of the roof of the fourth ventricle. Imperforation of the foramen of Luschka results in a pouch in the cerebellopontine angle that contains choroid plexus (Bochdalek's flower basket) and communicates with the fourth ventricle. This pouch has the potential to grow to a diverticulum and cause clinical symptoms. Based on our clinical observations, detailed radiologic and surgical-anatomic criteria were proposed to support the differential diagnosis of a diverticulum of the foramen of Luschka. Treatment strategies were also suggested.

   RELIABILITY; II GLIOMAS; BRAIN; RESECTION; SURGERY; LESIONS; EXTENT
AB OBJECTIVE: Evidence for cerebral reorganization after resection of low-grade glioma has mainly been obtained by serial intraoperative cerebral mapping. Noninvasively collected data on cortical plasticity in tumor patients over a surgery-free period are still scarce. The present study therefore aimed at evaluating motor cortex reorganization by navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) in patients after perirolandic glioma surgery.
   METHODS: nTMS was performed preoperatively and postoperatively in 20 patients, separated by 26.1 1 24.8 months. Further nTMS mapping was conducted in 14 patients, resulting in a total follow-up period of 46.3 + 25.4 months. Centers of gravity (CoGs) were calculated for every muscle representation area, and Euclidian distances between CoGs over time were defined. Results were compared with data from 12 healthy individuals, who underwent motor cortex mapping by nTMS in 2 sessions.
   RESULTS: Preoperatively and postoperatively pooled CoGs from the area of the dominant abductor pollicis brevis muscle and of the nondominant leg area differed significantly compared with healthy individuals (P < 0.05). Most remarkably, during the ensuing follow-up period, a reorganization of all representation areas was observed in 3 patients, and a significant shift of hand representation areas was identified in further 3 patients. Complete functional recovery of postoperative motor deficits was exclusively associated with cortical reorganization.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite the low potential of remodeling within the somatosensory region, long-term reorganization of cortical motor function can be observed. nTMS is best suited for a noninvasive evaluation of this reorganization.

AB BACKGROUND: Microneurosurgical techniques involve complex manual skills and hand-eye coordination that require substantial training. Many factors affect micro-neurosurgical skills. The goal of this study was to use a systematic evidence-based approach to analyze the quality of evidence for intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence microneurosurgical performance and to make weighted practical recommendations.
   METHODS: A literature search of factors that may affect microsurgical performance was conducted using PubMed and Embase. The criteria for inclusion were established in accordance with the PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols) statement.
   RESULTS: Forty-eight studies were included in the analysis. Most of the studies used surgeons as participants. Most used endoscopic surgery simulators to assess skills, and only 12 studies focused on microsurgery. This review provides 18 practical recommendations based on a systematic literature analysis of the following 8 domains: 1) listening to music before and during microsurgery, 2) caffeine consumption, 3) beta-blocker use, 4) physical exercise, 5) sleep deprivation, 6) alcohol consumption before performing surgery, 7) duration of the operation, and 8) the ergonomic position of the surgeon.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite the clear value of determining the effects of various factors on surgical performance, the available body of literature is limited, and it is not possible to determine standards for each surgical field. These recommendations may be used by neurosurgical trainees and practicing neurosurgeons to improve microsurgical performance and acquisition of microsurgical skills. Randomized studies assessing the factors that influence microsurgical performance are required.

AB BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive accesses to the anterior skull base include the endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) and the supraorbital eyebrow approach. These 2 are often seen as competing approaches, not alternative or combinatory approaches. In this study, we evaluated the anatomic limitations of each approach and the combined approach for accessing the anterior skull base.
   METHODS: Ten neurovascular injected cadaver heads were used for the study. The supraorbital approach to the anterior skull base was performed on 5 heads, and EEA was done on the other 5 heads. Then, the supraorbital approach was added to the 5 heads receiving EEA. Visualization and surgical limitations were recorded by the ability to perform resection of the crista galli, anterior clinoid, cribriform plate, and planum sellae.
   RESULTS: The maximal lateral extension of EEA for anterior skull base was the midorbit line anteriorly but narrowing down toward the orbital apex. The limitation of the supraorbital approach was found mostly medial and anterior. Drilling of anterior skull base was impossible medially between the sphenoethmoidal suture and the posterior aspect of the crista galli. The combined approach showed complementary areas of visualization and surgical maneuverability. Three clinical cases were presented to illustrate the indications for the stand-alone supraorbital approach, EEA, and combined approach.
   CONCLUSION: The limitations of the EEA when dealing with lateral extension of anterior skull base meningiomas, and the limitations of the supraorbital eyebrow approach for medial skull base drilling and reconstruction, can be overcome by a judicious, anatomically based combination of both approaches.

AB OBJECTIVE: There is an increasing trend toward skull base (SB) approaches and retractorless surgery to minimize brain manipulation during surgery. We evaluated the radiographic changes over time after surgical resection of anterior cranial fossa meningiomas with and without both SB approaches and/or fixed retractor systems.
   METHODS: All adults undergoing primary resection of an anterior cranial fossa World Health Organization grade I meningioma through a craniotomy at a single academic tertiary-care institution from 2010 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were reviewed and contrast-enhanced tumor and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) volumes were measured. Matched-pair analyses between patients who underwent SB and non-SB approaches, as well as retractorless and retractor-assisted (RA) surgery, were made.
   RESULTS: Of the 136 total patients, 20 (15%), 12 (9%), 46 (34%), and 58 (43%) underwent SB/retractorless, SB/RA, non-SB/retractorless, and non-SB/RA surgery, respectively. Patients who underwent non-SB and RA surgery each independently had longer times to FLAIR resolution than those who underwent SB (20.9 vs. 5 months; P = 0.04) and retractorless (12 vs. 5.2 months; P = 0.02) surgery, respectively. Patients who underwent both non-SB and RA surgery had the longest median time to FLAIR resolution (30 months vs. 4 months in SB/retractorless, 3.6 months in SB/RA, and 3 months in non-SB/retractorless; P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of SB approaches in combination with retractorless surgery may decrease the duration needed for FLAIR resolution after surgery. The results from this study therefore advocate SB approaches and retractorless surgery along the anterior SB when possible.

AB OBJECTIVE: Many treatment techniques have been used for refractory lumbar facet joint pain; however, their efficacy has been controversial. In this study, we investigated the clinical efficacy and safety of intra-articular pulsed radiofrequency for the treatment of refractory lumbar facet joint pain in patients with low back pain.
   METHODS: Twenty patients with refractory lumbar facet joint pain were recruited, and each patient was treated via intra-articular pulsed radiofrequency. The treatment effects were measured with a numerical rating scale, and the technical accuracy of intra-articular pulsed radiofrequency treatment was evaluated independently by 2 radiologists. Any adverse events or complications also were checked.
   RESULTS: We performed intra-articular pulsed radiofrequency treatment at 48 levels of the lumbar facet joints in 20 patients (5 men and 15 women; mean age, 64.50 +/- 10.65 years) with refractory lumbar facet joint pain. Pain scores were significantly reduced at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after treatment (P < 0.05). The face validity revealed good intraarticular pulsed radiofrequency results in all 20 patients, without any serious adverse effects.
   CONCLUSIONS: Treatment using intra-articular pulsed radiofrequency is an alternative to other techniques in patients with refractory lumbar facet joint pain.

AB OBJECTIVE: This retrospective case control study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using Estimation of Physiological Ability and Surgical Stress (E-PASS) and Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enumeration of Mortality and Morbidity (POSSUM) systems in patients undergoing spinal surgical procedures. Degenerative spine disease has increased in incidence in aging societies, as has the number of older adult patients undergoing spinal surgery. Many older adults are at a high surgical risk because of comorbidity and poor general health.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 217 patients who had undergone spinal surgery at a single tertiary care. We investigated complications within 1 month after surgery. Criteria for both skin incision in E-PASS and operation magnitude in the POSSUM system were modified to fit spine surgery. We calculated the E-PASS and POSSUM scores for enrolled patients, and investigated the relationship between postoperative complications and both surgical risk scoring systems. To reinforce the predictive ability of the E-PASS system, we adjusted equations and developed modified E-PASS systems.
   RESULTS: The overall complication rate for spinal surgery was 22.6%. Forty-nine patients experienced 58 postoperative complications. Nineteen major complications, including hematoma, deep infection, pleural effusion, progression of weakness, pulmonary edema, esophageal injury, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, reoperation, renal failure, sepsis, and death, occurred in 17 patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for predicted postoperative complications after spine surgery was 0.588 for E-PASS and 0.721 for POSSUM. For predicted major postoperative complications, the AUC increased to 0.619 for E-PASS and 0.842 for POSSUM. The AUC of the E-PASS system increased from 0.588 to 0.694 with the Modified E-PASS equation.
   CONCLUSIONS: The POSSUM system may be more useful than the E-PASS system for estimating postoperative surgical risk in patients undergoing spine surgery. The preoperative risk scores of E-PASS and POSSUM can be useful for predicting postoperative major complications. To enhance the predictability of the scoring systems, using of modified equations based on spine surgery-specific factors may help ensure surgical outcomes and patient safety.

AB OBJECTIVE: Endovascular interventions in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and symptomatic cerebral vasospasm (sCVS) are commonly performed, but the potential benefits of repeated interventions have not been proven. The aim of this study was to show the potential burden and opportunities of repeated endovascular interventions in cases of recurrent sCVS.
   METHODS: We reviewed 15 patients with SAH who underwent more than 2 endovascular treatments of recurrent sCVS (CVS group) regarding the radiation doses, their clinical course, and their functional outcome. A case-control group of SAH patients without sCVS individually matched for age, World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies score, Fisher grade, and treatment modality was used as control group (non-CVS group).
   RESULTS: A total of 70 endovascular treatments were performed in the CVS group. CVS group patients received longer mechanical ventilation (585 days vs. 439 days) and showed a higher rate of tracheostomy (12/15 vs. 7/15) and shunt-dependent hydrocephalus (6/15 vs. 2/15) than did the non-CVS patients. Moreover, patients from the CVS group underwent significantly (P < 0.001) more angiographies (median, 5 vs. 2) and CTP/CTA scans (median, 4 vs. 1) and consequently received significantly (P < 0.001) higher radiation doses. The rate of unfavorable outcomes (mRS 3-6) after 3 months was nonsignificantly higher in the CVS group (6/15 vs. 2/15), but after 6 months at least 5/14 patients from the CVS group showed a favorable outcome.
   CONCLUSION: Repeated endovascular treatments of SAH patients with recurrent CVS are complex and expose the patients to high radiation doses. Nevertheless, favorable results could be achieved in patients in otherwise poor condition.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the surgical technique of percutaneous full-endoscopic anterior transcorporeal cervical discectomy (PEATCD) in detail and report the clinical outcomes and radiologic changes in patients with cervical intervertebral disc herniation (CIVDH).
   METHODS: A novel procedure, PEATCD, was performed on 36 patients with CIVDH between June 2015 and June 2016. A retrospective study of these patients was carried out over a follow-up period of 12-24 months. The visual analog scale scores, Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scores, and improvement rates (IRs) of the JOA scores were used to evaluate neurologic symptoms. Radiologic follow-up included magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography scan, and standard radiographs.
   RESULTS: All patients reported immediate postoperative relief of neck and arm pain compared with the recorded preoperative levels of discomfort, and the JOA scores improved gradually during the follow-up period. The IRs of the neurologic evaluations ranged from 60% to 100%, the average being 85.47% + 9.32%. The decrease in the intervertebral disc height was statistically significant (P < 0.0001), and there were no adverse clinically related symptoms. No collapse of the drilled vertebrae was recorded, and the bone defects showed significant decreases within 3 months after the operation. There were no surgery-related complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: PEATCD combines the benefits of an anterior transcorporeal approach with endoscopy, preserves the cervical motion segment and causes less damage to the disc, and significantly decreases surgical trauma. Therefore, PEATCD is a safe, effective, minimally invasive, alternative procedure for patients with CIVDH.

AB INTRODUCTION: Brain retraction is often required to develop a surgical corridor during the resection of deep-seated intracranial lesions. Traditional blade retractors distribute pressure asymmetrically and may case local tissue damage. Tubular retractors minimize this pitfall by distributing pressure evenly, which has been shown to translate to significant safety and efficacy data. Further qualified reports regarding the use of tubular retractors are of interest.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 1 surgeon's experience with 20 cases of minimally invasive resection with the ViewSite Brain Access System (n = 7) and BrainPath (n = 13) systems. In addition, a comprehensive review of all published cases of tubular retractor systems used for resection of subcortical neoplastic, cystic, infectious, vascular, and hemorrhagic lesions was conducted.
   RESULTS: Of the 20 cases analyzed, gross total resection was achieved in 18, with an associated 10% immediate postoperative complication rate and 5% long-term complication rate. A comprehensive review of the literature showed 30 articles describing 536 cases of resection of deep neoplastic or colloid cysts with an overall complication rate of 9.1%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Tubular retractor systems have a favorable safety profile and are an important tool in the armamentarium of a neurosurgeon for the resection of deep intracranial lesions.

AB BACKGROUND: Measures of health care use such as length of hospital stay (LOS) are used as proxies for quality of care after spine surgery. Accordingly, hospitals and health systems are investing considerable resources into the preoperative identification of patients at risk for prolonged LOS. This study aims to investigate the impact of preoperative level on outcomes and LOS after spinal fusion.
   METHODS: The medical records of 204 elderly (>= 60 years) male patients undergoing elective spinal fusion (>= 3 levels) at a major academic institution from 2005 to 2015 were reviewed. The lower hemoglobin (Hgb) level was designated as <13.5 g/dL. We identified 83 (40.7%) patients with preoperative lower Hgb levels and 121 (59.3%) with normal levels (low Hgb, n = 83; normal Hgb, n = 121). The primary outcomes investigated were complications and LOS.
   RESULTS: Demographics and comorbidities were similar between both groups, with mean Hgb levels being 12.3 +/- 0.9 g/dL and 14.9 +/- 1.0 g/dL for the low and normal cohorts, respectively. The lower Hgb cohort experienced higher rates of postoperative delirium (21.7% vs. 5.8%; P = 0.0007), non-wound infections (6.0% vs. 0.0%; P = 0.006), and hematoma formation (3.6% vs. 0.0%; P = 0.035). There was a significant difference in LOS between the cohorts, with the low Hgb cohort experiencing approximately a 2-fold increase (low Hgb, 8.1 +/- 5.9 days vs. normal Hgb, 4.8 +/- 2.5 days; P < 0.0001). Preoperative Hgb and hematocrit levels negatively correlated with LOS (Hgb, R = -0.388, P < 0.001 and Hct, R = -0.2883, P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that elderly male patients with lower preoperative Hgb levels have increased LOS and postoperative delirium after spinal fusion. Moreover, preoperative Hgb levels negatively correlate with LOS.

ID FLUOROSCOPY; SAFETY
AB BACKGROUND: Spine surgeons are exposed to high amounts of radiation from fluoroscopic procedures during their lifetime. In this study, we evaluated spine surgeons' knowledge of and attitude regarding radiation exposure during spine surgery.
   METHODS: We developed a questionnaire including questions about surgeons' characteristics and knowledge of and attitude regarding radiation exposure during spine surgery. A survey was performed with the members of AOSpine Latin America. The main variables studied were specialty, years of experience, surgeon's position during fluoroscopy, and practices to reduce the patient's and surgeon's radiation exposure during surgery. The results were analyzed and compared among different specialties, levels of experience, and countries of origin.
   RESULTS: The questionnaire was answered by 371 members of AOSpine Latin America from different countries. The sample was mostly from orthopedic surgeons (57.1%) and surgeons in practice for longer than 10 years (54.2%). Thyroid lead protection was used by 64.2% of the spine surgeons, lead glasses by 20.2%, and lead gloves by 7%. A dosimeter badge was never or only rarely used by 75.7%. The correct answer for surgeon position during lateral lumbar fluoroscopy was reported by only one-third of the surgeons. The reported rate of thyroid protector use was higher in surgeons from Brazil and Colombia compared with surgeons from Mexico and Argentina (P < 0.001), whereas the use of pulsed-mode fluoroscopy was higher in Mexico and Argentina compared with Brazil and Colombia (P < 0.0001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Future efforts toward implementing educational programs in Latin America focused on safety strategies are needed to minimize intraoperative radiation exposure.

AB BACKGROUND: Clinical and molecular factors are essential to define the prognosis in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status, age, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), and extent of surgical resection are the most relevant prognostic factors. Our investigation of the role of gender in predicting prognosis shows a slight survival advantage for female patients.
   METHODS: We performed a prospective evaluation of the Project of Emilia Romagna on Neuro-Oncology (PERNO) registry to identify prognostic factors in patients with GBM who received standard treatment.
   RESULTS: A total of 169 patients (99 males [58.6%] an d 70 females [41.4%]) were evaluated prospectively. MGMT methylation was evaluable in 140 patients. Among the male patients, 36 were MGMT methylated (25.7%) and 47 were unmethylated (33.6%); among the female patients, 32 were methylated (22.9%) and 25 were unmethylated (17.9%). Survival was longer in the methylated females compared with the methylated males (P = 0.028) but was not significantly different between the unmethylated females and the unmethylated males (P = 0.395). In multivariate analysis, gender and MGMT methylation status considered together (methylated females vs. methylated males; hazard ratio [HR], 0.459; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.242-0.827; P = 0.017), age (HR, 1.025; 95% CI, 1.002-1.049; P = 0.032), and KPS (HR, 0.965; 95% CI, 0.948-0.982; P < 0.001) were significantly correlated with survival.
   CONCLUSIONS: Survival was consistently longer among MGMT methylated females compared with males. Gender can be considered as a further prognostic factor.

AB OBJECTIVE: An increasing demographic aging of the general population results in a rising incidence of octogenarians and nonagenarians with spine disease. Patients older than 65 years represent the majority of patients with degenerative lumbar spine disease in our daily clinical routine. Surgical treatment is undertaken reluctantly because of an increased rate of comorbidities. We therefore assessed complication rates of lumbar decompression in regard to neurological outcome and medical conditions in patients age 80 years or older in a retrospective single-center series.
   METHODS: Data for 244 patients (124 female, 120 male; mean age, 83.1 +/- 3 years; age range, 80-95 years) who underwent decompressive surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis or disc herniation between April 2007 and February 2016 were assessed retrospectively. Age at surgery, neurologic deficits (preoperative and postoperative), relevant medical comorbidities and previous lumbar decompression, intraoperative and postoperative complications (e.g., surgery-related, medical), duration of surgery, length of hospital stay, and rate of revision surgeries were recorded.
   RESULTS: Surgery was performed for lumbar stenosis (184 patients; 75.4%), lumbar disc herniation (13 patients; 5.3%) or both (47 patients; 19.3%). Seventy-six patients (31.3%) patients experienced preoperative neurologic deficits; 48 (63.2%) of these patients improved, 28 (36.8%) of them were unchanged after surgery, and none deteriorated. New transient, postoperative, neurologic deficits occurred in 6 patients (2.5%). All 55 (22.5%) intraoperative complications were mild to moderate, and no severe surgical complications occurred. Two hundred fifteen patients (88%) had relevant medical disorders. Nineteen (7.7%) postoperative medical complications were reported in 17 patients (nu), of which 14 (73.7%) were severe and 5 (26.3%) were mild (4 pulmonary embolisms, 6 pneumonias, 3 myocardial infarctions, 1 postoperative renal failure, 5 urinary tract infections). Medical complications that necessitated intensive care unit treatment and resulted in lethal outcome were seen in 2 patients (0.8%).
   CONCLUSION: Despite their age, the vast majority of octogenarians and nonagenarians benefited from lumbar decompression surgery. Mild to moderate intraoperative complications were relatively frequent, whereas severe intraoperative complications did not occur. The majority of medical complications was severe, but the incidence was acceptable, and the postoperative outcome was still favorable in most patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: Realistic, safe, and efficient modalities for simulation-based training are highly warranted to enhance the quality of surgical education, and they should be incorporated in resident training. The aim of this study was to develop a patient-specific virtual cerebral aneurysm-clipping simulator with haptic force feedback and real-time deformation of the aneurysm and vessels.
   METHODS: A prototype simulator was developed from 2012 to 2016. Evaluation of virtual clipping by blood flow simulation was integrated in this software, and the prototype was evaluated by 18 neurosurgeons. In 4 patients with different medial cerebral artery aneurysms, virtual clipping was performed after real-life surgery, and surgical results were compared regarding clip application, surgical trajectory, and blood flow.
   RESULTS: After head positioning and craniotomy, bimanual virtual aneurysm clipping with an original forceps was performed. Blood flow simulation demonstrated residual aneurysm filling or branch stenosis. The simulator improved anatomic understanding for 89% of neurosurgeons. Simulation of head positioning and craniotomy was considered realistic by 89% and 94% of users, respectively. Most participants agreed that this simulator should be integrated into neurosurgical education (94%). Our illustrative cases demonstrated that virtual aneurysm surgery was possible using the same trajectory as in real-life cases. Both virtual clipping and blood flow simulation were realistic in broad-based but not calcified aneurysms. Virtual clipping of a calcified aneurysm could be performed using the same surgical trajectory, but not the same clip type.
   CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully developed a virtual aneurysm-clipping simulator. Next, we will prospectively evaluate this device for surgical procedure planning and education.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate short-term efficacy and safety of percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED) in treatment of symptomatic adjacent segment disease (ASD) after lumbar fusion in elderly patients >65 years old.
   METHODS: Patients >65 years old who underwent PIED for ASD after lumbar fusion between January 2013 and September 2016 were retrospectively evaluated. Demographics and perioperative clinical data were collected from medical records. MacNab classification, visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores as well as 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey were used to assess the efficacy of PTED.
   RESULTS: We evaluated 25 consecutive patients >65 years old with ASD (11 men, 14 women; mean age 74.65 +/- 9.61 years). Mean follow-up time was 37.14 + 11.60 months. Of patients, 84.0% (21/25) had excellent or good clinical outcomes, 12.0% (3/25) had fair outcomes, and 4.0% (1/25) had poor outcomes. Complications included 1 dural laceration, 1 postoperative dysesthesia, and 1 recurrence. For patient-reported outcomes, significant improvements were observed postoperatively compared with preoperatively in visual analog scale (P < 0.05), Oswestry Disability Index (P < 0.05), Japanese Orthopaedic Association (P < 0.05), and 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: PTED demonstrated satisfactory shortterm efficacy and safety in management of ASD after lumbar fusion in patients >65 years old. PTED may be an alternative choice for elderly patients with ASD after lumbar fusion.

AB OBJECTIVE: A possible risk factor for premature facet joint degeneration or adjacent segment degeneration after surgical treatment of spine fractures is facet joint violation (FV) during insertion of pedicle screws. The aim of this study was to determine risk factors for FV in the thoracic and lumbar spine after minimally invasive screw insertion or open instrumentation (OI).
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all patients with spine fractures requiring posterior stabilization was performed. After patients were allocated to the thoracic/lumbar group, FV was defined as an involvement caused by the positioning of a pedicle screw and its severity as determined by computed tomography was assessed by using a customized scoring system. Gender, age, and body mass index as well as segmental facet joint angle and the instrumentation system used (side-loading [SL] vs. top-loading) were considered as individual factors.
   RESULTS: In total, 1099 pedicle screws were evaluated and an FV was identified in 433 instrumentations (39.0%). OI was used in 61.1% (n- 671) and an SL system was inserted in 45.0% (n = 494). In both, the thoracic (odds ratio [OR], 1.663; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.119-2.472; P = 0.012) and the lumbar spine (OR, 0.494; 95% CI, 0.317-0.771; P = 0.002), OI was associated with a lower risk of FV. The violation rate was significantly higher when using a SL system (thoracic spine: OR, 1.822; 95% CI, 1.163-854; P = 0.009; lumbar spine: OR, 0.311; 95% CI, 0.2030.477; p S 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: FV is a common complication after thoracic and lumbar spine surgery. Although both, the SL instrumentation and a minimally invasive procedure increases its occurrence, the patient characteristics do not affect the rate of FV.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify a potential microvascular etiology in patients who underwent vestibular schwannoma surgery (VSS) complicated by postoperative microvascular brainstem ischemia.
   METHODS: Charts were retrospectively reviewed of all patients who had an MRI within 14 days of VSS in years 2005-2016. Patient characteristics, preoperative and postoperative imaging features, clinical course and potential predictors of brainstem ischemia were recorded. Cadaveric dissections of 4 cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cisterns with focus on the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) microvascular were also performed to identify candidate vessels and potential etiology.
   RESULTS: Fifty-four of 258 patients had an MRI within 14 days of VSS. Retrosigmoid approach was used in 61.1% of patients, translabyrinthine approach in 25.9%, and middle fossa approach in 13.0%. Four patients (7.4%) had acute microvascular ischemia involving the middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) adjacent to the cranial nerve (CN) VII-VIII complex demonstrated on postoperative MRI. A statistically significant association was found between the translabyrinthine approach and acute brainstem ischemia (odds ratio, 10.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.004-112.7). Dissection of CPAs revealed 10-20 perforating arteries per specimen originating from the lateral pontine and the flocculopeduncular segments of the AICA. Most micro-vessels travelled in retrograde fashion along the anteroinferior surface of the CN VII-VIII complex to perforate the cisternal surface of the MCP. No patient had residual or delayed neurologic deficits related to brainstem ischemia at final follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: While effort should be made to preserve perforating vessels, microvascular brainstem ischemia is often asymptomatic and did not lead to permanent neurologic deficits in our series.

AB BACKGROUND: The vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation (VGM) is a rare intracranial arteriovenous fistula with a dramatic manifestation during infancy and 100% mortality without treatment. Therapeutic strategies for VGMs have changed over time as a result of advances in endovascular techniques. We present our experience and multimodality approach within the last 4 decades.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis and angiographic review were performed of patients with VGM between 1975 and 2016 at our institution.
   RESULTS: Eighteen consecutive patients were identified, including 10 with choroidal and 8 with mural VGMs. In 37 endovascular interventions, a transarterial approach was mostly performed (82.8%). One patient was initially treated surgically and received 2 Gamma Knife treatments after multiple embolizations. The preferred embolization agent was histoacryl for choroidal VGMs and a combination of coils and histoacryl for mural VGMs. Total occlusion was achieved in 87.5% of mural VGMs and 11.1% of choroidal VGMs. Cerebral hemorrhages and infarction occurred only in patients younger than 1 month. At a median follow-up interval of 4.6 years, good outcome was achieved in 53.8% and poor outcome in 46.2%, with an overall mortality of 16.7%. Poor outcome was significantly associated with choroidal-type VGMs, age <1 month at first embolization, and incomplete occlusion.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular embolization using a transarterial approach is the therapy of choice. Gamma Knife radiosurgery can be considered as second-line therapy in a multimodal approach. Whereas treatment within the first month of life is associated with the highest mortality and complications, we did not detect any severe adverse events thereafter.

ID COMPLICATIONS; PUNCTURE; ICP
AB OBJECTIVE: To compare a new method of noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) measurement with conventional lumbar puncture (LP) opening pressure.
   METHODS: In a prospective multicenter study, patients undergoing LP for diagnostic purposes underwent intracranial pressure measurements with HeadSense, a noninvasive transcranial acoustic device, and indirectly with LP. Noninvasive measurements were conducted with the head in a 30 degrees tilt and in supine position before and after LP. The primary endpoint was the correlation between nICP measurement in supine position before LP and the LP opening pressure.
   RESULTS: There was no correlation between supine nICPs before LP and the LP opening pressures (r = - 0.211, P = 0.358). The 30 degrees head-tilt nICPs correlated with the supine nICPs before LP (r = 0.830, P < 0.01). There was no correlation between supine nICPs before and after LP (r = 0.056, P = 0.831) or between 30 degrees head-tilt nICPs and LP opening pressures (r = 0.038, P = 0.861).
   CONCLUSIONS: There was no correlation between nICPs and LP opening pressures. Further development is warranted before transcranial acoustic HeadSense can become a clinical tool for investigating patients with neurologic conditions.

AB OBJECTIVE: Anatomy of the posterior ascending artery (PAA) has been well documented. The PAA forms an apical arcade, which supplies the small branches to the tip of the dens. However, morphometrics of this artery such as diameter and distance from the midline, which could be applied to the diagnosis and surgical procedure, are scant. We aimed to investigate the anatomy of the PAA in order to apply our findings to surgical procedures such as C2 pedicle screw placement.
   METHODS: Ten sides from 5 Caucasian cadaveric heads in which red latex was injected were used. The origin of the PAA, diameter of the PAA and apical arcade, and the distance from midline were recorded.
   RESULTS: Diameters of the PAA and apical arcade were approximately 1 mm and 0.7 mm, respectively. Distance from the midline to the PAA was approximately 7 mm. In 1 specimen, the os odontoideum was observed on top of the dens.
   CONCLUSIONS: The result of this study could provide anatomic knowledge, which is important for C2 pedicle screw placement to the spine surgeon.

AB OBJECTIVE: To study the microsurgical anatomy of the occipital artery (OA) to determine the optimal segment for use as a conduit in revascularization bypass surgery.
   METHODS: Twelve sides of 6 cadaveric heads that had been injected with colored silicone were exposed using C-shaped postauricular incision. The OA was dissected from its point of origin to the proximal part of the distal segment. For each segment, the diameters and length were measured, and its branches and proximity to the recipient vessel (V3) were examined.
   RESULTS: The mean diameters were 2.6 mm at the digastric segment, 2.04 mm at the point where it exits the mastoid sulcus, 2.0 mm, at the point just before the last descending muscular branch, and 1.8 mm and 1.5 mm after the branch and attached to the superior nuchal line, respectively. The length of the OA from the point where it exits the mastoid sulcus to the point at which it revealed the last descending muscular branch was 53 mm, and the distance of this section to the V3 was 31 mm.
   CONCLUSIONS: In pathologies necessitating vertebral artery revascularization surgery, it is possible to easily mobilize the OA with a C-shaped postauricular incision in the lateral suboccipital region. To reach a more appropriate segment in terms of diameter, length, and easy anastomosis, V3 sulcal and OA suboccipital segments are more suitable. Thus, if bypass surgery is indicated in cases of vertebrobasilar ischemia, the suboccipital segment of the OA may be an ideal choice and considered as an artery that can be used in "SOS" conditions.

DT Article
DE Epidemiology; Medicare; Part D
ID DOCTORS; DRUGS; ABUSE
AB OBJECTIVE: The Centers for Disease Control have declared that the United States is amidst a continuing opioid epidemic, with drug overdose - related death tripling between 1999 and 2014. Among the 47,055 overdose-related deaths that occurred in 2014, 28,647 (60.9%) of them involved an opioid.
   METHODS: The Part D Prescriber Public Use File, which is based on beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program, was used to query information on prescription drug events incurred by Medicare beneficiaries with a Part D prescription drug plan from 31 June 2014 to 30 June 2015. Only those providers with the specialty description of neurosurgeon, as reported on the provider's Part B claims, were included in this study.
   RESULTS: A total of 271,502 beneficiaries, accounting for 971,581 claims and 22,152,689 day supplies of medication, accounted for the $52,956,428.40 paid by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for medication that the 4085 neurosurgeons submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Part D program in the 2014 calendar year. During the same year, 402,767 (41.45%) claims for 158,749 (58.47%) beneficiaries accounted for 6,458,624 (29.16%) of the day supplies of medications and $13,962,630.11 (26.37%) of the total money spent by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Part D that year. Nationwide, the ratio of opioid claims to total Medicare Part D beneficiaries was 1.48. No statistically significant regional differences were found.
   CONCLUSIONS: The opioid misuse epidemic is a complex and national issue with patterns of prescription not significantly different between regions. All neurosurgeons must be cognizant of their prescribing practices so as to best support the resolution of this public health crisis.

AB BACKGROUND: The massa intermedia (MI) or interthalamic adhesion is an inconsistent band spanning between bilateral medial thalami that is absent in up to 20%-30% of individuals. Little is known of its significance, especially in regard to functional pathways. Probabilistic diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has recently been used to seed the lateral habenula and define its afferent white matter pathway, the stria medullaris thalami (SM). We sought to determine whether the MI serves as a conduit for crossing of limbic fibers such as the SM.
   METHODS: Probabilistic DTI was performed on 10 subjects who had presence of a MI as visualized on magnetic resonance imaging. Tractography was also performed on 2 subjects without MI. Manual identification of the lateral habenula on axial T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was used for the initial seed region for tractography.
   RESULTS: In all subjects, the SM was reliably visualized. In 7 of the 10 subjects with MI, there was evidence of SM fibers that crossed to the ipsilateral hemisphere. Three subjects with small diameter MI did not have tractographic evidence of crossing SM fibers. Of the 7 subjects with crossing SM fibers within the MI, 5 showed predilection toward the right orbitofrontal cortex from both the left and right seed regions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Probabilistic DTI provides evidence of SM fibers within the MI. Given its anatomic location as a bridging pathway between thalami, further studies are necessary to assess its role within the limbic functional network.

AB BACKGROUND: In the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), patients need to be selected for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in the acute phase. Selection criteria vary, however, depending on the patient's situation. This study investigated the effectiveness of a noncontrast computed tomography and symptom-based protocol for selecting patients for MT.
   METHODS: This retrospective study included 20 patients with AIS. The first 8 patients (earlier group) were screened by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Among the later 12 patients, MRI was deliberately skipped in 9, and major vessel occlusion was confirmed by digital subtraction angiography after meeting 4 criteria: 1) hospital arrival within 90 minutes from onset; 2) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 9-25; 3) history or presence of atrial fibrillation; and 4) Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score of 9-10. The clinical outcomes and time course were compared.
   RESULTS: Among the later period group, 9 of 12 patients skipped MRI-based confirmation of large vessel occlusion. They underwent the direct angiography protocol, which had a 78% (7/9) positive predictive value for identifying large-vessel occlusion. In this group, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores on the next day had significantly improved (median -8 points) compared with those at admission. Good functional outcome did not differ between the groups at 3 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: Noncontrast computed tomography and symptom-based selection of MT to treat AIS can be useful for achieving better neurologic recovery in a subgroup of patients. This approach could broaden the use of MT.

AB OBJECTIVE: The endoscopic endonasal approach to the anatomically complex lateral skull base presents technical challenges. The use of the eustachian tube as a landmark to identify the petrous internal carotid artery has recently been reported, and this study aims to define the anatomic relationship between the eustachian tube and its surrounding structures using cadaveric dissection and radiologic analysis.
   METHODS: To clarify the relationship of the eustachian tube with its surrounding structures, we performed endoscopic and microscopic dissection of 4 adult cadaveric heads and analyzed computed topography scans from 20 patients.
   RESULTS: The eustachian tube is divided into the osseous and cartilaginous parts. The cartilaginous part can he further subdivided into the posterolateral, middle, and anteromedial parts, based on its relationship to the skull base. The eustachian tube is closely related to the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, the foramen lacerum, and the petrosal apex and is directed away from the oblique sagittal plane almost parallel to the vidian canal at 12.2 degrees +/- 6.2 degrees (mean +/- standard deviation). The relationship between the course of the vidian canal and the eustachian tube can aid the estimation of the anatomic course of the horizontal segment of the petrous carotid artery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The eustachian tube is a useful landmark for predicting the course of the internal carotid artery when accessing the lateral skull base regions via an endonasal route. A profound understanding of the relationship between the eustachian tube and the surrounding skull base structures is important for endoscopic endonasal skull base surgeries.

AB OBJECTIVE: Accurate preoperative and intraoperative differentiation between primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and glioblastoma (GBM) is sometimes difficult. Distinguishing between these tumors during surgery is important because surgical treatment is different between the 2 tumors. In this study, we established a new method of intraoperative differentiation between PCNSL and GBM using intraoperative flow cytometry (iFC), and we retrospectively tested whether iFC was useful for the intraoperative diagnosis of PCNSL and GBM.
   METHODS: We analyzed the iFC data of 250 patients (28 with PCNSL and 222 with GBM) and then evaluated aneuploidy and S-phase population.
   RESULTS: Aneuploidy was detected in 54.5% of GBM cases but in only 7.14% of PCNSL cases. Aneuploidy indicated GBM, but it was difficult to distinguish PCNSL from GBM when a tumor had a diploid pattern. Thus, for tumors without aneuploidy, we evaluated the S-phase population: S2, the ratio of the average height of the S-phase to the height of the diploid peak. S2 was significantly higher in PCNSL than in GBM. Based on these results, we established an algorithm for differentiating between PCNSL and GBM using DNA aneuploidy and S2. Comparing this new iFC algorithm and the permanent pathologic diagnosis, the sensitivity was 89.3%, the specificity was 93.7%, and the accuracy was 93.2%.
   CONCLUSIONS: iFC is useful for the intraoperative differentiation between PCNSL and GBM and it aids in intraoperative decision making within a short time. The accuracy of intraoperative diagnosis of these tumors seems to be higher with the combination of iFC and intraoperative rapid pathologic diagnosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Use of telemedicine for neurotrauma when performed by neurosurgeons is an innovative care option for traumatic brain injury patients, particularly in countries with limited neurosurgery expertise resources. In recent years, Albania has developed a robust telemedicine program and teleneurotrauma is the flagship of the program. We aimed to evaluate the outcomes of the first neurotrauma patients managed via telemedicine in Albania.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on all telemedicine consultations for isolated neurotrauma was performed from 2014 through 2016. Patient demographics, mechanism of injury, modes of teleneurotrauma consultation (store-and-forward vs. live video consultation), outcomes of teleconsultation (whether the patient was transferred or kept at the regional hospital), operative procedures for those transferred, length of hospital stay, and discharge status were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Of the 146 teleconsultations for neurotrauma, asynchronous technology (store-and-forward) accounted for the majority of teleconsultations (84%), while the live plus store-and-forward technique was employed in 15% of cases. Median time of response to teleconsultation was 20 minutes. Sixty-six percent of patients remained at the referring hospital for further observation and did not require transfer to a trauma center. Of the patients transferred to the tertiary care, 91% were treated nonoperatively, 85% percent were discharged to home, 9% were transferred to another hospital, and 6% died in the hospital.
   CONCLUSION: Telemedicine for neurotrauma, when structured appropriately and led by neurosurgeons, is a valuable service for the entire country, prevents unnecessary transfers to trauma center, and saves resources, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate effectiveness of early Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in treatment of medically refractory trigeminal neuralgia (TN).
   METHODS: This retrospective review comprised 108 consecutive patients with medically refractory idiopathic TN between 2006 and 2014. All patients underwent GKRS targeting the root entry zone with a median maximum dose of 90 Gy and isodose line of 20%. Outcomes pertaining to pain and facial numbness were scored using Barrow Neurological Institute scales.
   RESULTS: Following a median latency period of 4 weeks, we observed complete or adequate pain relief (Barrow Neurological Institute scores of I-IIIB) in 86 of 108 patients (90%). At a median time of 17 months, 22 patients (26%) experienced pain recurrence. New-onset facial numbness was reported by 59 patients (55%). Treatment failure rates were highest among patients with a longer history of pain. Compared with patients with pain history of <= 5 years, patients with pain history of >5 years experienced longer latency before pain relief (P = 0.027). Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that pain history of <= 5 years was a significant predictor of pain relief (P = 0.049 and P = 0.045, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: GKRS achieves a high rate of pain relief among patients with medically refractory idiopathic TN. Pain history of <= 5 years is a reliable predictor of pain relief and appears to be associated with shorter latency to pain relief after GKRS. Therefore, early GKRS for patients with medically refractory idiopathic TN is recommended.

AB OBJECTIVES: In the study, we discuss the predictive value and cost-effectiveness of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) blocks before using dorsal root ganglion pulsed radio-frequency (DRG-PRF) in the treatment of low back pain.
   METHODS: The study comprised 60 patients with low back pain who were randomly assigned into 2 groups. Patients in group 1 were screened using DRG block before DRG-PRF treatment for responders. Patients in group 2 underwent DRG-PRF treatment without DRG block. Successful outcome was defined as patient satisfaction, improvement in numerical rating scale, and medication use reduction.
   RESULTS: In group 1 In = 30), 24 patients demonstrated good response to DRG block, and 20 patients had successful outcome at 6 months after DRG-PRF therapy. In group 2 (n = 30), 25 of the patients had successful outcome at 6 months after DRG-PRF therapy. The mean medical costs were NTS 19,245 and NT$ 16,375 for each successful case in groups 1 and 2, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this comparative cost-effectiveness study, the application of diagnostic DRG blocks before DRG-PRF did not have a significant impact on patient satisfaction, pain index score, or pain medication reduction. Furthermore, the application of diagnostic DRG blocks resulted in overall greater medical costs. These findings suggest that DRG-PRF without screening by DRG block is more cost-effective and less invasive.

AB BACKGROUND: Adult pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs) are relatively rare central nervous system (CNS) tumors with a favorable prognosis. We sought to investigate existing clinical management strategies and overall survival (OS) as a function of various clinical characteristics in a cohort of adult patients with PA.
   METHODS: The study cohort comprised all patients age >18 years diagnosed with a CNS PA diagnosed between 2004 and 2014 and included in the National Cancer Database. Clinical and treatment-related characteristics were recorded and analyzed for associations with OS following diagnosis using univariate and multivariate analyses.
   RESULTS: A total of 3057 adult patients, with a median age of 32 years, met the inclusion criteria. At diagnosis, 1138 patients (41%) had cerebral tumors, 832 (30%) had cerebellar tumors, 252 (9%) had tumors of the spinal cord, and 534 (19%) had tumors of unspecified location. More than three-quarters (77%) of the patients underwent surgery alone as local therapy, with the remainder split among surgery plus radiation (11.9%), radiation alone (4.5%), and biopsy alone (6.9%). On multivariate analysis, factors associated with inferior OS included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; P < 0.001), lower income (P < 0.001), higher Charlson/Deyo score (P = 0.023), larger tumor size (P = 0.023), and radiation therapy technique (P < 0.001; HR, 3.37 for external beam radiation therapy [EBRT]).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide large-scale prognostic information from a contemporary cohort of patients with PA, confirming that age, median income, Charlson/Deyo Score, and tumor size have significant effects on OS. Although resection status, tumor size, and location likely bias against EBRT, novel therapeutics are clearly needed in patients with tumors not amenable to resection or radiosurgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of minimally endoscopic discectomy (MED) and percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) in the treatment of adolescent lumbar disc herniation (ALDH).
   METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from 30 patients with ALDH who underwent MED and 48 patients with ALDH who underwent PELD at our hospital between January 2010 and January 2012. Baseline data included age, sex, symptom duration, and surgical segment. Perioperative data included duration of surgery duration, blood loss, and duration of postoperative hospitalization. The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and visual analog scale (VAS) for both the lower back and leg were recorded as surgical outcomes. All surgical outcomes were recorded before surgery, at 1 week after surgery, at 6 months after surgery, and at final follow-up.
   RESULTS: There were no significant differences in baseline data between the MED and PELD groups. Both groups showed improvements in ODI and VAS scores before surgery and at the final follow-up time point (P < 0.05); however, the MED group had a higher mean ODI score at 1 week (12.44 +/- 6.39 vs. 7.25 + 6.40; P = 0.02) and 6 months (9.33 1 7.43 vs. 3.97 1 7.64; P = 0.04) after surgery. In addition, mean VAS scores for lower back pain were higher in the MED group at 1 week (1.93 + 1.39 vs. 0.91 + 0.85; P = 0.01), 6 months (1.80 +/- 1.15 vs. 0.61 +/- 0.94; P = 0.00), and final follow-up (1.87 1 1.46 vs. 0.65 1 0.88; P = 0.00), as was mean VAS score for radicular pain at 1 week after surgery (1.48 +/- 0.76 vs. 0.74 +/- 0.81; P = 0.01). One patient in each group experienced recurrent lumbar disc herniation. No other complications were reported in either group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both PELD and MED are effective and safe surgical techniques for the treatment of ALDH; however, compared with MED, PELD is more advantageous for lower hack pain and provides more rapid resolution of radicular pain.

AB BACKGROUND: Tumor location is a major prognostic factor in glioblastomas and may be associated with clinical properties. This study established and analyzed the correlation between tumor location and clinical properties of glioblastomas in frontal and temporal lobes.
   METHODS: This retrospective study determined the location of glioblastomas in the frontal lobe (FL) or temporal lobe (TL) based on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical, radiologic, and molecular characteristics of FL and TL glioblastomas were compared to define their clinical properties, including sex, age, sides, relationship to ventricle, imaging subtypes, volume, isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation, promoter methylation of O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, progression-free survival, and overall survival.
   RESULTS: The study enrolled 406 patients (182 [44.83%] in FL group and 224 [55.17%] in TL group) with a mean age of 69.8 years. Compared with FL group, TL group had higher incidence of female patients (P = 0.024), tumor location distant to the ventricle (P = 0.006), isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations (P = 0.021), promoter methylation of O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (P = 0.012), and prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed between groups with respect to age >= 60 years at study entry (P = 0.668), sides (P = 0.879), imaging subtypes (P = 0.362), or volume (P = 0.709).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that different tumor locations are associated with diverse clinical properties of glioblastomas in FL and TL. This information will aid in increasing understanding of glioblastoma biology for application in baseline comparisons in future clinical trials.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of the Pipeline embolization device (PED) for posterior circulation aneurysms.
   METHODS: From November 2015 to November 2016, 35 patients with 38 posterior circulation aneurysms were treated with the PED in this retrospective study. We evaluated the angiographic and clinical outcomes of these aneurysms at last follow-up, and made a comparison between anterior (n = 163) and posterior circulation (n = 38) aneurysms regarding the technical nuances, occlusion rate, complications rate, and time to occlusion to explore whether we should rationalize the use of the PED for these aneurysms.
   RESULTS: With a median follow-up time of 5.5 months, complete occlusion was achieved in 33 aneurysms (91.7%). Aneurysms with stenosis parent artery tended to have lower occlusion rate (P = 0.064; odds ratio, 0.074; 90% confidence interval, 0.001-1.781), and V4 segment aneurysms tended to occlude themselves much faster than vertebrobasilar junction aneurysms (median, 148 vs. 246 days, respectively; P = 0.076). The periprocedural complication rate was 10.8%, and no major adverse events occurred. Compared with anterior circulation aneurysms, shorter procedure time (116.0 vs. 135.4 minutes, P = 0.012) and higher occlusion rate (91.4% vs. 72.8%, P = 0.023) were achieved for posterior circulation aneurysms. Besides, technical event rate (8.1% vs. 14.1%, P = 0.424) and complication rate (10.8% vs. 18.4%, P = 0.338) tended to be lower. Survival analysis indicated a shorter interval to complete occlusion for V4 segment aneurysms compared with anterior circulation (148 vs. 191 days, respectively; P- 0.047).
   CONCLUSIONS: PED has a favorable performance at posterior circulation, and it is rational to expand the indication to include these aneurysms. However, a case-control study is still needed to further expatiate whether the PED has advantages over traditional endovascular treatment.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the neuroprotective mechanisms of tamoxifen (TMX) during traumatic brain injury (TBI), especially the effects on estrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha) expression, as well as neuroinflammatory associations.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups: sham-operated controls, sham-operated controls given TMX (1 mg/kg/per day) for 3 days, those given a vehicle solution immediately after TBI, and those given TMX (1 mg/kg/per day) for 3 days. The functional outcome was evaluated by assessments of body weight and proprioception. The total ER alpha expression in the cortex also was investigated by Western blotting, and ER alpha expression in neurons, microglia, and astroglia were each detected via immunofluorescence staining. Neuronal apoptosis (marker caspase-3), activated microglia (marker 0X42), astroglia (marker glial fibrillary acidic protein), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression in microglia and astroglia in the cortex were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining methods.
   RESULTS: Compared with sham-operated controls, the TBI-induced proprioception inhibition was significantly attenuated by TMX therapy on day 3 after TBI. Using immunofluorescence staining, we found that the TBI-induced neuronal loss, apoptosis, activated microglia, and astrocyte expression and tumor necrosis factor-alpha and ER alpha in the cortex were significantly reduced by TMX therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the intraperitoneal injection of TMX (1 mg/kg/per day) for 3 days may affect ER alpha expression in neurons and glia, which is accompanied by neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, and it might represent one mechanism by which functional recovery occurs. We consider TMX administration to be a promising strategy for TBI.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms or haplotypes of the COL4A1 gene and the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).
   METHODS: We conducted a case-control study that included 181 patients from the Chinese Han population with hypertensive ICH and 197 hypertension patients without ICH. Genomic DNA was extracted by DNA extraction kit, and the 6 single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes of the COL4A1 gene were detected with a MassARRAY Analyzer. Unphased 3.1.4 and SPSS 19.0 were used to analyze the association between alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes of the COL4A1 gene and the risk of ICH.
   RESULTS: Compared with the control group, patients in the ICH group were significantly younger. There were no differences in gender, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, current smoking, and alcohol consumption between the 2 groups. Our association analysis showed that the rs3742207 A, rs11069830 A, and rs679505 A alleles were association factors of the risks of ICH; rs11069830 AA, rs544012 AC, and rs679505 AA genotypes were association factors of the risk of ICH; AA haplotype (rs3742207-rs11069830) was an association factor of the risk of ICH. After adjusting age and gender by multivariate logistic regression, the rs544012 AC and rs679505 M genotypes were independently associated with the risk of ICH.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the rs544012 AC and rs679505 AA genotypes were independently associated with the risk of ICH in the Chinese Han population and that the AA haplotype (rs3742207-rs11069830) in the COL4A1 gene may be related to the risk of ICH in the Chinese Han population; these conclusions need further confirmation in future studies with larger samples.

AB BACKGROUND: Classic hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis inevitably causes hemitongue atrophy and dysfunction. Thus, many variants have been developed to reduce tongue-related morbidities. A comparative study concerning these techniques was conducted in rats to systematically evaluate long-term functional and histologic outcomes of the recipient and donor systems.
   METHODS: Rats (8 per group) were treated by end-to-end neurorrhaphy (EEN), EEN using the hemisectioned and longitudinally split donor nerve (EEN-Hemi), end-to-side neurorrhaphy through a perineurial window (ESN-PW), or 30% to 40% partial neurotomy (ESN-PN). Four additional rats were left intact. At 8 months postoperatively, behavioral, electrophysiologic, and morphologic studies were carried out to compare the groups.
   RESULTS: All techniques resulted in partial functional recovery, but complete restoration was not obtained. There were no significant differences between the experimental groups in axon diameter or myelin thickness. The facial nerve fiber count after ESN-PN, but not after EEN-Hemi or ESN-PW, was comparable with that after EEN, which agreed with the behavioral and electrophysiologic results. The hypoglossal nerve fiber count after ESN-PN was slightly less than that after ESN-PW, but markedly more than that after EEN-Hemi, corresponding to the electrophysiologic examination. Quantitative measures of muscle fiber cross-sectional area and connective tissue area density of the tongue demonstrated severe muscle atrophy on the operated side after EEN and EEN-Hemi when compared with ESN-PVV and ESN-PN.
   CONCLUSIONS: ESN with 30% to 40% partial donor neurotomy offers the best balance between motor reinnervation and donor deficits. The method of nerve split for provision of hemihypoglossal nerve stump may not effectively preserve the tongue function.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential risk factors associated with seizure recurrence in different periods after epilepsy surgery.
   METHODS: A total of 303 patients with refractory epilepsy after epilepsy surgery were included. The Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model were performed to calculate the comparison of survival curves between groups and identify the risk factors associated with seizure recurrence in different periods after surgery.
   RESULTS: The significant predictors of seizure recurrence were determined, including duration of epilepsy (P = 0.018), seizure types (P = 0.009), magnetic resonance imaging findings (P = 0.007), intracranial electroencephalographic recordings (P = 0.002), sides of epileptogenic zone (P = 0.025), and types of surgery (P = 0.002). Moreover, the significant predictors of seizure recurrence within 12 months after surgery were also included, such as gender (P = 0.007), duration of epilepsy (P = 0.013), intracranial electroencephalographic recordings (P = 0.003), and types of surgery (P < 0.001). Our results indicated that the variables of magnetic resonance imaging findings (P = 0.015), sides of epileptogenic zone (P = 0.004), and seizure relapse within 12 months after surgery (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with seizure recurrence in 12-36 months after surgery. Seizure relapse within 12 months after surgery (P < 0.001) was also associated with seizure recurrence >36 months after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: We reconfirmed the well-known risk factors associated with seizure recurrence and also identified the controversial variables. In addition, we found that the risk factors associated with seizure recurrence were different in different periods after epilepsy surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether combined diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced perfusion-weighted imaging magnetic resonance imaging can be used to differentiate between common malignant brain tumors, including lymphomas and high-grade gliomas.
   METHODS: We evaluated 87 patients with histologically confirmed brain tumors, including 33 primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSLs) and 54 glioblastomas (GBMs). All patients underwent conventional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and perfusion-weighted imaging before surgical removal of the lesion or stereotactic biopsy.
   RESULTS: The maximum relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) ratios of GBMs were significantly higher than those of PCNSLs (P < 0.0001). The maximum rCBVs helped to distinguish PCNSLs from GBMs with 97.0% sensitivity, 90.7% specificity, and 0.98 area under the curve. The minimum apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of PCNSLs were significantly lower than those of GBMs (P < 0.0001). At an rCBV cutoff value of 4.0 and a minimum ADC of 1.0 x 10(-3) mm(2)/second, it was possible to differentiate between PCNSLs and GBMs.
   CONCLUSIONS: The combination of rCBV and ADC can facilitate the differentiation between PCNSLs and GBMs.

AB OBJECTIVE: Some patients experience failed back surgery syndrome after lumbar spine surgery. We report the effect of additional treatments for paralumbar spine and peripheral nerve diseases addressing residual symptoms after surgery.
   METHODS: We enrolled 74 patients (59 men and 15 women; mean age 62.9 years) who had undergone lumbar posterior decompression surgery. Mean follow-up after initial surgery was 26.2 months (range, 13-48 months). We subsequently diagnosed paralumbar spine diseases, including superior cluneal nerve entrapment neuropathy with (n = 3) or without gluteus medius muscle pain (n = 4) and gluteus medius muscle pain alone (n = 5), and peripheral nerve diseases, including peroneal nerve entrapment neuropathy (n = 4) and tarsal tunnel syndrome (n = 1), based on persistent or recurring clinical symptoms and nerve block effects. Treatment outcomes were analyzed by comparing Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire and Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores.
   RESULTS: Of74 patients, 54 (73.0%) improved after initial lumbar surgery (group A), and 20 (27.0%) continued to experience symptoms or experienced symptom recurrence during follow-up (group B). In group B, 4 patients improved with conservative therapy, 11 underwent 1 additional surgical procedure, and 5 underwent >1 additional surgical procedures. After these additional treatments, clinical outcomes were recorded as good. At the last follow-up visit, there was no difference between group A and group B.
   CONCLUSIONS: Of 74 patients who underwent lumbar spine surgery, 16 (21.6%) required additional surgery. To reduce the incidence of failed back surgery syndrome, concurrent diseases that may be masked by symptoms resulting from severe lumbar spine disease must be ruled out, as these diseases may become apparent after initial lumbar spine surgery.

   EEG
AB OBJECTIVE: Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the most frequent causes of epilepsy in the United States. However, reported risk factors for seizure after are inconsistent, and their impact on inpatient morbidity and mortality is unclear. We aimed to study the incidence, risk factors, and impact of seizures after ICH in a nationwide patient sample.
   METHODS: We queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample for patients admitted to the hospital with a primary diagnosis of ICH between the years 1999 and 2011. Patients were subsequently dichotomized into groups of those with a diagnosis consistent with seizure and those without. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess risk factors for seizure in this patient sample, and the association between seizures and mortality and morbidity. Logistic regression was then used for trend analysis of incidence of seizure diagnoses over time.
   RESULTS: We identified 220,075 patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of ICH. Of these, 11.87% had a diagnosis consistent with seizure. Factors associated with increased risk of seizure after ICH included higher categorical van Walraven score, encephalopathy, alcohol abuse, solid tumor, and prior stroke. Seizure was independently associated with decreased odds of morbidity (odds ratio [OR], 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-0.92) and mortality (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.72-0.77) in multivariate models controlling for existing comorbidities.
   CONCLUSIONS: Seizures after were associated with decreased mortality and morbidity despite attempts to correct for existing comorbidities. Continuous monitoring of these patients for seizures may not be necessary in all circumstances, despite their frequency.

AB BACKGROUND: A few options of extracranial donor vessels exist for use in intracranial vascular bypass procedures. To our knowledge, the use of an internal thoracic artery for cerebral revascularization has not been studied previously. Hence, this cadaveric feasibility study was performed.
   METHODS: The internal thoracic artery was dissected in adult cadaveric specimens. The proximal diameter, distal diameter, and length of the vessel were measured and recorded. The artery was then transected distally at the seventh intercostal space and transposed cranially, through a pterional craniotomy opening to reach the middle cerebral artery at the skull base.
   RESULTS: The mean diameter of the internal thoracic - at its proximal end was 3.5 mm and at its distal end was 2 mm. The average length of the vessel was 31 cm. There was no statistical difference between the measurements recorded from different sides or sexes. In each specimen, an internal thoracic artery was dissected, rotated superiorly, and advanced subcutaneously behind the ear to reach the middle cerebral artery at the skull base without difficulty and remained tensionless at the site of anastomosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this cadaveric study, we demon-strated the suitability of the internal thoracic artery in use as a donor vessel for a single site anastomosis in a high-flow cerebral bypass procedure.

AB BACKGROUND: Surgery is the primary treatment for Cushing disease. When surgery is unsuccessful in normalizing hypercortisolism, adjuvant radiation, such as stereotactic radiosurgery, may be useful to improve biochemical control.
   METHODS: This retrospective study included a cohort of consecutive patients treated with CyberKnife (CK) radiosurgery for active Cushing disease at Stanford Hospital and Clinics.
   RESULTS: As first-line treatment, all patients underwent transsphenoidal surgery with histologic demonstration of an adrenocorticotropic hormone-producing pituitary adenoma. CK was performed as adjuvant therapy for persistent or recurrent disease. The median time between surgery and CK was 14 34 months. Before CK, median maximal diameter of tumors was 9 mm (range, 7-32 mm), with cavernous sinus invasion in all patients (100%) and abutment of the optic chiasm in 1 patient (14.2%). With an average follow-up of 55.4 months, normalization of hypercortisolism was achieved in 4 patients (57.1%): 2 patients (28.5%) achieved normalization of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis without glucocorticoid replacement, and 2 patients developed hypoadrenalism (28.5%). The median time to biochemical remission was 12.5 months. Hypopituitarism occurred in only 1 patient (14.2%), and no patients had visual complications. Time between surgery and radiotherapy of <14 months was associated with a significantly improved biochemical remission rate (P = 0.02).
   CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of patients with Cushing disease, we demonstrate that CK is an effective treatment with rare complications.

   DECOMPRESSION SURGERY; OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND: Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPEC) often leads to cervical myelopathy. Although multiple procedures have been shown to be effective in the treatment of OPLL, outcomes are less predictable than in degenerative cervical myelopathy, and surgery is associated with high rates of complications and reoperation, which affect quality of life. In this study, we performed a decision analysis using postoperative complication data and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) utility scores to assess the average expected health utility and 5-year quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with the most common surgical approaches for multilevel cervical OPLL.
   METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for relevant articles published between 1990 and October 2017. Meta-analytically pooled complication data and HRQoL utility scores associated with each complication were evaluated in a long-term model.
   RESULTS: The overall incidence of perioperative complications ranged from 6.2% for laminectomy alone to 11.0% for anterior decompression and fusion. Revision surgery for hardware/fusion failure or progression was highest for laminectomy alone (3.0%) and lowest for laminectomy and fusion (1.6%). Laminoplasty resulted in the highest 5-year QALYs gained, compared with laminectomy and anterior approaches (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in QALY gained between laminectomy-fusion and laminoplasty.
   CONCLUSION: The results suggest that owing to the higher rates of complications associated with anterior cervical approaches, laminoplasty may result in improved long-term outcomes from an HRQoL standpoint. These findings may guide surgeons in cases where either procedure is a reasonable option.

AB OBJECTIVE: We investigated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics at the craniocervical junction (CCJ) using Time-SLIP magnetic resonance imaging to demonstrate the significance of ventral and dorsal combined CSF dynamics in assessing CSF flow disturbance in patients with Chiari malformation type I.
   METHODS: Fifteen examinations were performed in 9 cases of CM-I (3 female patients; mean age, 24.7 years; age range, 11-46 years) before or after craniocervical decompression. The longitudinal maximum movement of the caudal edge of tagged midsagittal CSF at the CCJ was measured as length of motion (LOM), and total on the ventral and dorsal sides was defined as total LOM.
   RESULTS: In 8 conditions, where it was concluded that no craniocervical decompression was necessary or where symptoms improved following craniocervical decompression based on the clinical symptoms, total LOM was 49.8 1 13.1 mm. In contrast, in the 7 cases where craniocervical decompression was mandatory, total LOM was 23.2 + 9.2 nun. Significant differences were identified between the 2 groups. Total LOM <35.0 mm resulted to indicate the insufficiency of CSF dynamics, because it corresponded to the necessity of craniocervical decompression based on patients' symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Time-SLIP MRI enabled clinicians to use novel dynamic indices, such as CSF motions, in addition to the conventional findings acquired by MRI. In particular, it was essential to examine combined ventral and dorsal CSF dynamics in assessing CSF patency at the CCJ in patients with CM-I.

TI Coloring Technique of Magnetic Resonance Angiography for Superficial
   Temporal Artery to Middle Cerebral Artery Bypass Surgery
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Bypass; Magnetic resonance angiography; Middle cerebral artery;
   Superficial temporal artery; Visualization of recipient artery
AB OBJECTIVE: Superficial temporal artery (STA)-to-middle cerebral artery (MCA) bypass is an established surgical technique for achieving revascularization. It is important to select the proper recipient artery of the MCA. Three-dimensional computed tomographic angiography (3D-CIA) and conventional angiography are useful in the selection process but need contrast agents. The authors have designed a coloring MRA technique that needs no agents to visualize the recipient artery. Retrospective evaluation of the efficacy and limitation for selection of the recipient artery and decision of the place and size of the craniotomy were carried out.
   METHODS: The authors performed the coloring MRA before operation since January 2013. Ninety-two patients underwent STA-MCA bypass for atherosclerotic stenosis or occlusion of internal carotid artery (ICA), MCA with reference to the coloring MRA. To evaluate the efficacy of coloring MRA, the control group consisted of 75 patients who underwent STA-MCA bypass between January 2012 to November 2013 with reference to 3D-CTA. The size of craniotomy was retrospectively calculated and compared.
   RESULTS: Neither additional craniotomy nor wrong selection of the recipient artery was done in either group. There was no significant difference in size between the 2 groups in both single and double bypass.
   CONCLUSIONS: The coloring MRA technique was not inferior to 3D-CTA with respect to the size of craniotomy. This novel technique was found to be very helpful not only for the virtual identification of the proper recipient artery but also for preoperative simulation such as decisions about length of donor artery, location, and size of craniotomy.

AB BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) occurs because of posterior fossa or brainstem lesions that disrupt the dentato-rubro-olivary tract, well known as the Guillain-Mollaret triangle. Clinical and radiologic hallmarks of this condition are palatal myoclonus and T2 hyperintensity of the inferior olivary complex on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), respectively. Because symptomatic HOD can complicate the recovery of patients with posterior fossa or brainstem lesions, the purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical and imaging findings of patients with HOD.
   METHODS: Sixteen patients (8 female and 8 male) with a mean age of 40.7 years, (range, 5-83 years) years were included in this study based on clinical symptoms and MRI findings.
   RESULTS: We reviewed the clinical and imaging findings in 16 cases of HOD at our institution. Seven patients (43.7%) had posterior fossa tumors, 6 patients (37.5%) had cavernoma, 2 patients (12.5%) sustained traumatic brain injury, and only 1 patient (6.2%) had cerebellar infarction. Posterior fossa surgery was performed in 13 (81.2%) of these patients. HOD was detected a mean of 7.2 months (range, 0.5-18 months) after surgery or primary neurologic insult. Unilateral HOD was observed in 10 patients (62.5%), while bilateral HOD was observed in only 6 patients (37.5%). Seven patients (43.7%) were asymptomatic for HOD, whereas 5 patients (31.2%) had symptoms attributable to HOD. Two patients died because of primary tumors, although mean follow-up after detection of HOD on MRI was 52.2 months (range, 1-120 months) in the remaining 14 patients. In these cases, no change in clinical symptoms or imaging findings was detected during follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this series, posterior fossa tumors and cavernomas were the most common causes of HOD. Although most of the patients with HOD remained asymptomatic, HOD complicated the course of recovery in almost one quarter of the patients included in this study. Neurosurgeons should be aware of HOD, which has characteristic clinical and imaging findings. In addition, HOD can complicate the recovery of patients with disruption to the dentato-rubro-olivary tract.

AB OBJECTIVE: The primary driver (PD) of cervical malalignment is important in characterizing cervical deformity (CD) and should be included in fusion to achieve alignment and quality-of-life goals. This study aims to define how PDs improve understanding of the mechanisms of CD and assesses the impact of driver region on realignment/outcomes.
   METHODS: Inclusion: radiographic CD, age >18 years, 1 year follow-up. PD apex was classified by spinal region: cervical, cervicothoracic junction (CTJ), thoracic, or spinopelvic by a panel of spine deformity surgeons. Primary analysis evaluated PD groups meeting alignment goals (by Ames modifiers cervical sagittal vertical axis/T1 slope minus cervical lordosis/chin-brow vergical angle/modified Japanese Orthopaedics Association questionnaire) and health-related quality of life (HRQL) goals (EuroQol-5 Dimensions questionnaire/Neck Disability Index/modified Japanese Orthopaedics Association questionnaire) using t tests. Secondary analysis grouped interventions by fusion constructs including the primary or secondary apex based on lowest instrumented vertebra: cervical, lowest instrumented vertebra (LIV) <= C7; CTJ, LIV <= T3; and thoracic, LIV <= T12.
   RESULTS: A total of 73 patients (mean age, 61.8 years; 59% female) were evaluated with the following PDs of their sagittal cervical deformity: cervical, 49.3%; CTJ, 31.5%; thoracic, 13.7%; and spinopelvic, 2.7%. Cervical drivers (n = 36) showed the greatest 1-year postoperative cervical and global alignment changes (improvement in T1S, CL, CO-C2, C1 slope). Thoracic drivers were more likely to have persistent severe T1 slope minus cervical lordosis modifier grade at 1 year (0, 20.0%; +, 0.0%; + +, 80.0%). Cervical deformity modifiers tended to improve in cervical patients whose construct included the PD apex (included, 26%; not, 0%; P = 0.068). Thoracic and cervicothoracic PD apex patients did not improve in HRQL goals when PD apex was not treated.
   CONCLUSIONS: CD structural drivers have an important effect on treatment and 1-year postoperative outcomes. Cervical or thoracic drivers not included in the construct result in residual deformity and inferior HRQL goals. These factors should be considered when discussing treatment plans for patients with CD.

AB OBJECTIVE: Metastatic spinal diseases are common health problems and there is no consensus on the appropriate treatment of metastases in several conditions. Using clinical measures (e.g., survival time and functional status), prognosis prediction systems advise on the appropriate interventions. The aim of this article is to assess and compare 4 widely used scoring systems (revised Tokuhashi, Tomita, van der Linden, and modified Bauer scores) on a single-center cohort.
   METHODS: A retrospective study was designed of 329 patients who were subjected to surgery because of metastatic spinal diseases. Subpopulations according to the classifications of the 4 scoring systems were identified. The overall survival was calculated with the Kaplan-Meier formula. The difference between the survival curves of subpopulations was analyzed with log-rank tests. The consistency rates for the 4 scoring systems are calculated as well.
   RESULTS: The follow-up period was 8 years. The median survival time was 777 days. The overall survival of prognostic categories in 3 scoring systems was significantly different from each other, but we found no differences between the categories of the van der Linden system. In this cohort, the revised Tokuhashi system gave the best approximation for survival, with a mean predictive capability 60.5%.
   CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of 4 standard scoring systems showed that 3 were self-consistent, although none of systems was able to predict the survival in our cohort. Based on the predictive capability, the revised Tokuhashi system may provide the best predictions with careful examination of individual cases.

AB OBJECT: To investigate the incidence, comorbidities, mortality, and causes of death in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH).
   METHODS: A cohort of 536 patients with possible NPH from a defined population with a median follow-up time of 5.1 years, (range 0.04-19.9 years) was included in the study. Patients were evaluated by brain imaging and intraventricular pressure monitoring, with a brain biopsy specimen immunostained against amyloid-beta and hyper-phosphorylated tau. Hospital records were reviewed for vascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Death certificates and yearly population of the catchment area were obtained from national registries.
   RESULTS: A total of 283 patients had a clinical diagnosis of iNPH, leading to a median annual incidence of 1.58 iNPH patients per 100,000 inhabitants (range, 0.8-4.5). Alzeimer disease-related brain biopsy findings were less frequent in iNPH patients than in non-iNPH patients (P < 0.05). An overrepresentation of hypertension (52% vs. 33%, P < 0.001) and T2DM (23% vs. 13%, P = 0.002) was noted in iNPH patients. Age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.04/year, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.06, P< 0.001) and T2DM (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.23-2.16, P < 0.001) increased the risk of death in the iNPH patients and in the total population. iNPH was associated with decreased risk of death (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.50-0.78, P < 0.001). The most frequent causes of death were cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Dementia as a cause of death was more common in non-iNPH patients (27% vs. 10%, P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension and T2DM are common in iNPH and the latter causes excess mortality in the affected patients.

   RECOVERY
AB BACKGROUND: Long-term narcotic use has risks and potentially life-threatening opioid-related side effects. Extended narcotic use in patients undergoing discectomy raises concerns of other underlying causes of pain or overprescription and/or abuse. The goal of this study was to determine which factors have an effect on active narcotic prescription >3 months after discectomy.
   METHODS: The PearlDiver Database was used in this study. Patients 30-55 years old undergoing discectomy without fusions were queried for active narcotic drug prescription occurring >30 days and >3 months after original surgery. Medical co-diagnoses were independently analyzed for effects on long-term active narcotic prescriptions. Prior narcotic use was defined by use within 4 months before surgery.
   RESULTS: Of 1321 patients undergoing discectomy, 621 had actively prescribed narcotics >3 months after surgery. Preoperative narcotic use had the largest effect on odds of postoperative prescription (odds ratio [OR] = 3.4). Medical comorbidities increasing odds of long-term narcotic prescriptions included migraines (OR = 1.4), diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.4), depression (OR = 1.6), and smoking (OR = 1.9).
   CONCLUSIONS: Narcotic abuse is a serious problem rooted in overprescription of these drugs, which has ultimately led to much more caution in prescribing among physicians. Because pain management and drug prescription must be balanced, identifying patients who may be susceptible to narcotic overprescription is important. Patients with co-diagnoses increasing odds of long-term narcotic prescriptions would benefit from early and continual postsurgical follow-up to ensure accurate pain management and to determine if narcotic prescriptions are justly warranted in the later postoperative period.

AB BACKGROUND: Brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability in trauma patients. Ethanol (EtOH) use near the time of injury may contribute to worse outcomes in these patients by exacerbating coagulopathy. There are limited data regarding the effects of EtOH on coagulation and progression of traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (TICH).
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospective observational study of 168 trauma patients with TBI at an urban level 1 trauma center. Thromboelastography (TEG) was performed on admission and over the subsequent 48 hours. Demographic, physiologic, and outcomes data were collected. Computed tomography imaging of the head performed within the first 48 hours of admission was analyzed for progression of TICH.
   RESULTS: Thirty-six percent of patients (n = 61) had positive blood EtOH on admission (median EtOH level = 198 mg/dL [range, 16-376 mg/dL]). EtOH-positive patients were less severely injured than EtOH-negative patients (P = 0.01). Other admission demographic and physiologic variables were similar between groups. There were no significant differences in TEG values between EtOH-positive and EtOH-negative patients on admission or during the subsequent 48 hours. There were no differences in radiographic progression of hemorrhage, the need for neurosurgical procedure, or mortality between EtOH-positive and EtOH-negative patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: EtOH use near the time of traumatic injury was not associated with alterations in coagulation, as measured by traditional coagulation tests or by TEG, in patients with TICH. Furthermore, a positive blood alcohol at admission was not associated with increased mortality or need for neurosurgical procedure these patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Although the Adult Spinal Deformity Frailty Index (ASD-FI) predicts major complications and prolonged hospital length of stay after adult spinal deformity surgery, the impact of frailty on postoperative changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is unknown.
   METHODS: Patients who underwent instrumented fusion of >= 4 levels for adult spinal deformity with minimum 2-year follow-up were stratified by Adult Spinal Deformity Frailty Index score into 3 groups: nonfrail, frail, and severely frail. Baseline and follow-up demographics, HRQol. measures, and radiographic parameters were analyzed. Primary outcome measures included proportion of patients who achieved substantial clinical benefit (SCB) in terms of Oswestry Disability Index, 36-Rem Short Form Health Survey Physical Component Summary, and numeric hack and leg pain scores.
   RESULTS: Inclusion criteria were met by 332 patients (135 nonfrail, 175 frail, 22 severely frail). Frail and severely frail patients were older and had more comorhidities, worse baseline HROol. and pain scores, and worse radiographic deformity than nonfrail patients (P < 0.05). At 2-year follow-up, all outcome scores were worse in frail and severely frail patients compared with nonfrail patients. Frail patients improved more than nonfrail patients and were more likely to reach SCB for Oswestry Disability Index (43.7% vs. 29.3%; P = 0.025), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey Physical Component Summary (56.9% vs. 51.2%; P = 0.03), and leg pain (45.8% vs. 23.0%; P = 0.03) scores, but not back pain (57.5% vs. 63.4%; P = 0.045) score.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite higher risk stratification and worse baseline HRQoL, frail patients were more likely to reach SCB for most HRQoL measures compared with nonfrail patients. Severely frail patients were the least likely to reach SCB for most HRQoL measures.

AB OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the functional role of the white matter connections running within and around the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL). We used direct electrostimulation during awake surgery to investigate this connectivity and to avoid permanent deficit after resection for right IPL gliomas.
   METHODS: We reviewed patients who underwent awake mapping for a glioma involving the right IPL. Resection was achieved up to functional corticosubcortical boundaries detected by electrostimulation. Results of the intraoperative mapping were confronted to preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging to perform anatomofunctional correlations.
   RESULTS: Fourteen consecutive patients were enrolled (9 men; mean age, 44 years). Cortically, the resection was limited anteriorly by the retrocentral somatosensory area (11 patients) or by the precentral motor cortex (3 patients). Subcortically, the thalamocortical pathways were identified anteriorly in all patients. Articulatory disturbances were elicited anteriorly and laterally (6 patients) corresponding to the superior longitudinal fasciculus part III. Deeper and superiorly, stimulating the superior longitudinal fasciculus part II or the arcuate fasciculus induced spatial disorders (6 patients). More laterally and posteriorly, disrupting the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus induced nonverbal semantic disorders (7 patients). Six patients had visual deficits while the optic radiations were stimulated. A total or subtotal resection was achieved in all patients but one. There were no permanent impairments, except an expected left superior quadrantanopia in 4 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first surgical series focusing on right IPL gliomas. The complex functional connectivity detected within and around this region fully supports the use of intraoperative multimodal functional mapping for optimizing outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Procalcitonin, a bloodstream inflammatory biomarker, has proven useful in the diagnosis of sepsis in critically ill patients treated in medical and surgical intensive care units. This study aims to further our understanding of the significance of procalcitonin levels in neuroscience intensive care unit (NICU) patients.
   METHODS: Neurosurgical patients who underwent a procalcitonin assay in an NICU over a 2-year period were included in our analysis. A procalcitonin level >= 0.2 ng/mL was considered a positive result. Infection was defined by clinical and/or microbiological diagnosis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value in the diagnosis of clinically and/or microbiologically identified infection were calculated for procalcitonin level >= 0.2 ng/ml.
   RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 203 patients, including 63 with a positive procalcitonin assay (31%). Meeting the criteria for SIRS was the most common reason for a procalcitonin draw (35.5%). A procalcitonin level >0.2 ng/ml was not significantly associated with infection (P = 0.25). With a 37.4% false-negative rate and a 10.8% false-positive rate, the sensitivity of a procalcitonin level >0.2 ng/ml was 35.0%, specificity was 74.4%, the positive predictive value was 65.1%, and the negative predictive value was 45.7%. A receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.61.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the utility of procalcitonin in sepsis and bacterial pneumonia has been amply demonstrated, this biomarker shows limited utility in diagnosing infection in our cohort, emphasizing the importance of cautious and selective use of procalcitonin assays in NICU patients.

TI Autologous Bone Harvest in Anterior Cervical Spine Surgery: A
   Quantitative and Qualitative In Vitro Analysis of Cadaveric Tissue
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE ACDF; Bone grafting; Bone harvest; Cervical spine
AB BACKGROUND: The cervical spine may be used as a harvesting site of local autograft material during anterior cervical discectomy and fusion procedures. We analyzed the quality and composition of bone grafts obtained from different parts of the cervical vertebrae in a cadaveric model.
   METHODS: Five fresh adult human cadavers with intact cervical spines were used. Using a Smith-Robinson anterior approach to expose C4-5 and C5-6 vertebrae, samples from 4 vertebral sites were harvested under a microscope. Anterior osteophytes were removed piecemeal by a Leksell rongeur (sample A). A high-speed burr was used to drill the endplates of C4-5 and C5-6 (sample C) and uncovertebral joints of C4-5 (sample B) and C5-6 (sample D). Then 20 slides (4 per cadaver) were prepared and analyzed.
   RESULTS: Tissue fragmentation was associated with use of the high-speed burr. Sample A had minimal tissue fragmentation. Samples B-D showed moderate to high fragmentation. Cartilage was found in all samples. Of the 20 slides, 6 contained soft tissues (sample A in 4, sample D in 2). Disc material was identified in 6 slides (sample A in 1, sample B in 4, sample D in 1). Sample A had the greatest number of intact osteocytes and chondrocytes, and sample B had the least.
   CONCLUSIONS: Anterior osteophytes provide the highest number of osteocytes, with the highest osteocyte/chondrocyte ratio. Osteocyte viability is a function of vertebral body site and collection technique, with fragmentation caused by use of a high-speed burr decreasing the number of viable osteocytes.

AB OBJECTIVE: Neurocognitive impairment is often reported in moyamoya disease. We aimed to detect default mode network (DMN) alterations using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and their association with neurocognitive impairments. In addition, the influence of surgical treatment was individually evaluated.
   METHODS: Seven patients with moyamoya disease underwent preoperative resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychologic tests. We compared the resting-state networks (RSNs) of our patients with those obtained from relatively large cohort datasets (127 healthy controls) using group independent component analysis with dual regression analysis. We also explored correlations between RSN alterations and neuropsychologic scores. We evaluated individuals again 6 months after surgery to identify changes.
   RESULTS: Patients had statistically significant differences in DMN connectivity compared with healthy controls. There were marked changes in functional connectivity of the ventral DMN of patients with low working memory and performance speed scores. These changes were characterized by increases and decreases in various locations. In contrast, patients with average or high neuropsychologic scores showed similar connectivity to the controls. In 5 patients who underwent vascular reconstruction surgery, MN functional connectivity changed to resemble that of healthy controls.
   CONCLUSIONS: In moyamoya disease, working memory and performance speed scores were inversely correlated to the degree of disruption of the DMN, suggesting a possible relationship between higher cognitive function and orderliness of fundamental brain networks. Vascular reconstruction surgery may contribute to normalization of brain networks. Analysis of RSNs may produce potential biomarkers for cognition in moyamoya disease.

ID GAMMA-KNIFE RADIOSURGERY; ARTERIOVENOUS-MALFORMATIONS; METASTASES; CARE
AB OBJECTIVE: Despite the increasing prominence of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in treating intracranial and spinal pathologies, there is currently a dearth of exposure to this modality in the neurosurgical residency. To address this gap, the aim of this study is to assess neurosurgery educators' views regarding the current state of SRS exposure, and to identify potential approaches to improve residency education in this domain.
   METHODS: Qualitative thematic analysis and constructivist grounded theory methodology were employed. Semistructured telephone-based interviews were conducted with current or past residency program directors, as well as current departmental chairs across neurosurgical departments in Canada. Interviews were transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis using open and axial coding.
   RESULTS: Of the 34 eligible participants, the overall response rate was 41.1% (14/34), with a 35.3% participation rate (12/34). Participants represented 9 of the 12 Canadian institutions surveyed. The majority of participants were current program directors (n = 8), followed by past program directors (n = 2), and departmental chairs (a = 2). Most respondents 75% (9/12) view an increasing role for SRS in neurosurgery. Unanimously, respondents endorse greater exposure to SRS during residency through formal residency rotations and engagement in interdisciplinary tumor boards to facilitate involvement in clinical decisionmaking.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to systematically collate neurosurgery educators' views on SRS in residency in Canada and demonstrates recognition of the discordance between SRS in practice and residency training. Neurosurgery educators broadly endorse increased exposure to this modality. Future work is needed to delineate the requirements necessary to achieve adequate competency in SRS.

AB BACKGROUND: To analyze the differences in tumor progression patterns and histopathologic characteristics between skull base meningiomas (SBMs) and non-skull base meningiomas (NSBMs).
   METHODS: Retrospective data of 382 patients with SBMs and 200 patients with NSBMs who underwent primary microsurgical resection between January 1995 and December 2016 were analyzed. Data related to clinical history, neuroimaging, surgical technique, and follow-up were reviewed. A separate prospective cohort of 78 meningiomas operated on from June 2016 to July 2017 was analyzed (World Health Organization [WHO] grade and Ki-67 proliferation index) for biologic comparison.
   RESULTS: Skull base location, WHO grade II tumor, and subtotal resection were independent predictors of unfavorable outcome. The overall tumor progression rate in the SBM group (33%) was higher than in the NSBM group (19.7%) (P = 0.006) (mean follow-up period, 51 months). The 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 78%, 60%, and 45% in the SBM group, whereas it was 90%, 80%, and 53% in the NSBM group, respectively. Interestingly, there was no difference in the median PFS after 10 years of follow-up (SBMs 210 months vs. NSBM 212 months, P = 0.93). In the prospective cohort of 78 meningiomas, there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of WHO grade I tumors and in the mean Ki-67 index of WHO grade I meningiomas between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSION: There is a divergent tumor progression pattern for surgically treated SBMs vis-a-vis NSBMs. Differences in tumor biology and the proportion of Simpson grade I resections are likely attributable factors.

   BRANCH; REPAIR; CELLS; SIZE
AB BACKGROUND: Different degrees of neurotmesis of the peripheral facial nerve frequently are encountered in clinic, for which the epineurial neurorrhaphy is the preferred technique. However, because of the capability of self-restoration of nerves and the side effects of surgery, neurorrhaphy may not be an optimal choice for various degrees of neurotmesis. In this study, we explored the necessity of epineurial neurorrhaphy for different degrees of neurotmesis, in addition to investigating factors that impact neural functional recovery.
   METHODS: Rat models were divided into 6 groups: intact, noninjured controls; A, one-third cross-sectional facial nerve disconnected injury after epineurial neurorrhaphy; B, one-third cross-sectional facial nerve disconnected injury without epineurial neurorrhaphy; C, two-thirds cross-sectional facial nerve disconnected injury after epineurial neurorrhaphy; D, two-thirds cross-sectional facial nerve disconnected injury without epineurial neurorrhaphy; and E, two-thirds cross-sectional facial nerve disconnection followed by complete transection and neurorrhaphy. Facial functional recovery was assessed with the use of behavioral assessments and electrophysiologic tests. The morphologic changes of trunk of the facial nerve were analyzed by osmium-toluidine blue staining and immunofluorescence. The modification of central nervous system was evaluated by retrograde labeling and Nissl's staining of facial nerve nuclei.
   RESULTS: Concerning morphologic and functional assessments, there were no statistically significant differences between one-third facial nerve disconnected injury with or without epineurial neurorrhaphy and the intact model. For two-thirds facial nerve disconnected injury, direct neurorrhaphy was superior to complete transection followed by neurorrhaphy. For two-thirds facial nerve disconnected injury, the nerves can largely self-restore in neural structure and function without the use of epineurial neurorrhaphy. For the facial nerve nuclei, the number of neurons decreased in the more than two-thirds nerve disconnected models, and models with two-thirds disconnection and without neurorrhaphy had the least number of neurons. For the distribution of neurons in different facial nerve subnuclei, both models with two-thirds nerve disconnection without neurorrhaphy and models with two-thirds nerve disconnection after complete transection and neurorrhaphy demonstrated disorganization of neurons, in which the latter was more serious.
   CONCLUSIONS: For one-third disconnected facial nerve injury, there's no need to suture the nerve stump, although for residual one-third connected nerve injury, direct suture is preferable if permitted than pre-performing a complete transection to trim the stump. Residual one-third connected nerve fibers largely can self-restore. The results from this study indicate that neural functional defect may be attributed to the damage and misdirection of peripheral nerve fibers and central neurons.

AB BACKGROUND: The outcomes of microsurgery of previously coiled aneurysms have been poorly described, and little is known about the factors predictive of poor outcome. Here we aimed to identify predictors of poor outcome following microsurgery for previously coiled recurrent aneurysms.
   METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study of a prospectively maintained vascular database, we reviewed presentations, recurrent aneurysm measurements, surgery, and outcomes of microsurgical clipping of recurrent previously coiled intracranial aneurysms.
   RESULTS: Our series comprised 39 patients (mean age, 49 years; range, 22-70 years) who underwent microsurgical clipping of 40 previously coiled intracranial aneurysms. One patient suffered seizures, 1 patient experienced transient neurologic worsening, and 1 patient developed hyponatraemia, none of whom had long-term sequelae. Two patients sustained postoperative infarcts, for an overall incidence of permanent morbidity of 5.1%. There were no deaths or rebleeds on follow-up. In 3 patients, including the 2 patients with infarct and 1 patient with a transient deficit, an attempt was made to remove the coil ball. These patients had larger aneurysms (1106 mm(3) vs. 135 mm(3); P = 0.005), with larger coil balls (257 mm(3) vs. 52 mm(3); P = 0.01) and wider necks (7.09 mm vs. 2.69 mm; P = 0.02) but smaller remnant heights (1.59 mm vs. 1.99 mm; P = 0.04). They were also more likely to have prolapsing coil loops (3/3 vs. 3/27; P = 0.016).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates good clinical outcomes from microsurgical clipping of recurrent aneurysms. In the vast majority of cases, clips can be applied primarily. Coil ball removal is associated with increased morbidity, and thus should be considered only as a second-line option, with the likely need identified before the initiation of surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: Common peroneal nerve (CPN) compressive neuropathy is the most common lower-extremity entrapment neuropathy.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained single-institution database of all patients with CPN palsy who underwent decompression and neuroplasty over a 5-year period was performed.
   RESULTS: Thirty patients underwent a neuroplasty of the CPN over a 5-year period (2010-2015) at our institution. The median age was 45 years, and there was a male preponderance. The average time between first onset of symptoms to surgery was 122.9 weeks and between first clinic visit and surgery was 21 weeks. The etiology of the CPN neuropathy was as follows: in 12 patients, it followed a surgical procedure and in 14 patients, it occurred after a trauma to the lower extremity. In 2 patients, it occurred as a result of a mass lesion compromising the nerve and in 1 patient, a local infection predisposed to CPN palsy. Right and left lower extremities were equally involved. The median body mass index was 28.6. The most common presentation was weakness of the tibialis anterior (TA) and extensor hallucis longus (EHL) and loss of sensation in the distribution of the CPN or one of its major branches. Pain was a presenting symptom in 16 patients. Only 12 of the 30 patients had a positive Tinel's sign at the site of compression over the lateral fibular neck. Preoperative electrophysiologic confirmation of CPN neuropathy was available in all patients. Mean follow-up was 52 weeks. Prone positioning and selective use of the operating microscope provided excellent visualization and surgical exposure of the CPN from the lower popliteal region to the peroneal tunnel. Average operating room time was 170 minutes and average skin-to-skin time 91 minutes. Clinical improvement after surgery in terms of motor function was noted in 24 of the 26 patients who presented with a motor deficit. The most consistent improvement was noted in the TA and EHL; a trend toward greater improvement with shorter time to surgery was noted. No complications related to the surgical site or CPN were encountered, and no patient had a decline in their neurologic examination as a consequence of the surgery. One patient developed a positioning-related right upper-extremity brachial plexus neuropraxic injury after surgery that recovered completely.
   CONCLUSIONS: Common peroneal neuropathy usually presents with weakness of the TA and EHL and decreased sensation or pain in the distribution of the CPN. Microscope-assisted surgical neuroplasty of the CPN at the lateral fibular neck with the patient in a prone position allows decompression of the nerve from the lower popliteal region to the peroneal tunnel. Significant improvement in motor strength after surgery, particularly of the TA and EHL, was observed in this series.

AB BACKGROUND: Intraoperative use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) has a protective effect in patients with acute lung injury and is recommended during anesthesia to minimize postoperative pulmonary complications. However, high levels of pressure might also cause harm to the lung because of overdistension. This retrospective study was designed to compare the effect of low and high levels of PEEP on the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients with normal lung function who were undergoing an elective craniotomy.
   METHODS: Two thousand four hundred thirty-seven patients without any pre-existing respiratory disease, who underwent an elective craniotomy, were hospitalized from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2012. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the application of an intraoperative PEEP < 5 or >= 5 cm H2O, referred as low and high groups. Primary outcome was the odds of postoperative pneumonia and the requirement for either noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or reintubation and mechanical ventilation (MV).
   RESULTS: One thousand twenty-three (42%) of 2437 patients were in the low group, and 1414 patients (58%) were in the high group. Patients in the low group did not show any difference in the incidence of postoperative pneumonia (P = 0.523) or the requirement of postoperative reintubation and MV (P = 0.999) compared with those in the high group. The incidence of reintubation and MV is significantly associated with postoperative pneumonia (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Low and high levels of PEEP show similar incidences of postoperative pneumonia and requirement of postoperative NIV or invasive MV in patients with normal function of the lungs undergoing elective craniotomy.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the carotid atherosclerotic plaque features in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
   METHODS: A total of 288 patients meeting the included criteria were enrolled and divided into an ulcerated plaque group (n = 139) and a nonulcerated plaque group (n = 149). Patients in the ulcerated plaque group were further subdivided into <50% and >= 50% stenosis groups. Carotid plaque component characteristics including luminal stenosis, carotid plaque volume, hypoechoic plaque volume, and hyperechoic plaque volume were analyzed by color Doppler ultrasound measurement. Associations between ulcerated plaque and carotid plaque features were also evaluated. The relationships among the levels of MMP-9, hs-CRP, and carotid stenosis rate were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
   RESULTS: The plaque volume, hypoechoic plaque volume, and luminal stenosis in the ulcerated plaque group were higher than that of the nonulcerated plaque group (P< 0.05). Ulcerated plaque was positively associated with luminal stenosis, plaque volume, and hypoechoic plaque volume after adjusting for sex and age. The result remained similar after adjusting for age, sex, and carotid luminal stenosis. The levels of MMP-9 and hs-CRP in the ulcerated plaque group were significantly higher than those of the nonulcerated plaque group (P < 0.01). For the ulcerated plaque group, the higher the carotid stenosis rate, the higher the level of MMP-9 and hs-CRP.
   CONCLUSIONS: Higher carotid atherosclerosis plaque volume, hypoechoic plaque volume, and luminal carotid stenosis may be symptoms of ulcerated plaque. Increased MMP-9 and hs-CRP levels could be used as adjunctive therapies of carotid stenosis at the molecular level.

   Prognostic factor; Elderly
ID B-CELL LYMPHOMA; PRIMARY CNS LYMPHOMA; IBRUTINIB
AB BACKGROUND: Recent genetic analysis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) showed that the MyD88 1265P mutation, which is related to NF-kappa B signaling, was a genetic hallmark for PCNSL; thus it could serve as a genetic marker for diagnosis and a potential target for molecular therapy. However, the role of the MyD88 mutation in PCNSL has not been defined. In this study, we investigated the role of the MyD88 mutation and clinical features of PCNSL-treated patients at several institutions to determine its significance as a prognostic factor.
   METHODS: Forty-one PCNSL (diffuse large B-cell type) patients from 8 institutions were included in this study. Their median age was 68 years; median follow-up was 26.7 months; median overall survival was 26.7 months; and their 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates were 75.6%, 58.5%, and 43.9%, respectively. Deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from frozen tissue, and the MyD88 L265P mutation was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing.
   RESULTS: The MyD88 L265P mutation was found in 61.0% (25/41) of cases. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that neither MyD88 L265P mutation nor age >65 years alone significantly predicted overall survival relative to MyD88 wild type and age <65. The MyD88 L265P mutation was predominantly present in patients aged >65 years. Among age >65 patients, the MyD88 L265P mutation portended a worse overall survival compared with the MyD88 wild type (11.5 vs. 56.2 months P < 0.04).
   CONCLUSION: The MyD88 L265P mutation predicted a poor prognosis in elderly PCNSL patients. A new tailormade treatment strategy might be needed for these patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: There is an ongoing search for conditions that induce spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The seasonal pattern of SAH is shown in a large meta-analysis of the literature, but its explanation remains undecided. There is a clear need for sound meteorologic data to further elucidate the seasonal influence on SAH. Because of the stable and densely monitored atmospheric situation in the north of the Netherlands, we reviewed our unique cohort on the seasonal incidence of SAH and the association between SAH and local atmospheric changes.
   METHODS: Our observational cohort study included 1535 patients with spontaneous SAH admitted to our neurovascular center in the north of the Netherlands between 2000 and 2015. Meteorologic data could be linked to the day of the ictus. To compare SAH incidences over the year and to test the association with meteorologic conditions, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (Cis) were used, calculated by Poisson regression analyses.
   RESULTS: Atmospheric pressure variations were significantly associated with aneurysmal SAH. In particular, the pressure change on the second and third day before the ictus was independently correlated to a higher incidence of aneurysmal SAH (IRR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.00-1.23). The IRR for aneurysmal SAH in July was calculated 0.67 (95% CI, 0.49-0.92) after adjustment for temperature and atmospheric pressure changes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Atmospheric pressure variations are a delayed trigger for aneurysmal SAH. Also, a significantly decreased incidence of aneurysmal SAH was noted in July.

AB OBJECTIVE: To optimize follow-up and surveillance routines after intracranial surgery, knowledge about when complications occur is needed. We sought to explore when postoperative complications are detected after brain tumor surgery and assess their severity.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of hospital records in 1291 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy for intracranial tumors between 2008 and 2016 at our institution. Medical history, comorbidity, registered outcomes within 30 days, and time of detection of complications were registered. The severity and nature of complications were graded via the Landriel classification system.
   RESULTS: A total of 708 complications were registered in 465 (36.0%) operations within the first 30 days; 30.6% experienced mild or moderate complications (grade I-II), and 5.4% experienced severe or fatal complications (grade III-IV). A total of 5.7% (n = 74) developed complications within 24 hours; 45.7% of severe and fatal complications and 8.6% of mild and moderate complications were detected within 24 hours, whereas 77.1% and 57.5%, respectively, were detected within 1 week. Multivariate analysis revealed that Karnofsky Performance Status score <70 and longer duration of surgery were factors associated with developing severe or fatal complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Mild and moderate complications, dominated by extracranial infections such as urinary tract infections and pneumonias, are very common after intracranial tumor surgery. Detection rates for mild and moderate complications are probably greatly affected by local routines for surveillance, screening, discharge, documentation, and follow-up, perhaps limiting their usefulness as a quality measure. Severe and fatal complications are mainly detected in the early postoperative course.

AB BACKGROUND: The main aim of this study is to elucidate whether the neuroprotective effect of memantine, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2B (NR2B) antagonist, affects neuronal nitrosative stress, apoptosis, and NR2B expression and improves functional outcomes.
   METHODS: Immediately after the onset of fluid percussion traumatic brain injury (TBI), anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into sham-operated, TBI + vehicle, and TBI + memantine groups. TBI rats were treated with a memantine intraperitoneal injection dose of 20 mg/kg intraperitoneally and then 1 mg/kg every 12 hours intraperitoneally for 6 doses. The motor function, proprioception, infarction volume, and neuronal apoptosis were then measured. Immunofluorescence was used to evaluate astrogliosis, microgliosis, nitrosative stress, and NR2A and NR2B expression in cortical cells. All the parameters were assessed 72 hours after TBI.
   RESULTS: Compared with the sham-operated controls, the TBI-induced motor and proprioception deficits, and increased infraction volume after TBI were significantly attenuated by memantine therapy. The TBI-induced neuronal apoptosis, astrogliosis, and microgliosis, the numbers of neuronal NO synthase and 3-nitro-L-tyrosine expression in neurons, and inducible NO synthase expression in microglia and astrocyte cells in the ischemic cortex after TBI were significantly improved by memantine therapy. Simultaneously, without affecting the NR2A expression in neuronal cells, the NR2B expression significantly decreased after memantine therapy, as evaluated by an immunofluorescence stain.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intraperitoneal injection of memantine in the acute stage may ameliorate TBI in rats by affecting NR2B expression and decreasing neuronal apoptosis and nitrosative stress in the injured cortex. These effects might represent 1 mechanism by which functional recovery occurred.

AB OBJECTIVE: Cortical ependymomas (CEs), supratentorial ependymomas that selectively involve the cerebral cortex, are relatively rare neoplasms that have not been extensively described. The purpose of our study was to identify the clinical features, radiologic characteristics, and treatment of a series of such tumors.
   METHODS: Thirteen patients with CEs from our hospital were included in this study. Epidemiologic characteristics, clinical features, imaging findings, treatment methods, and clinical outcomes were reviewed retrospectively.
   RESULTS: The patients consisted of 7 men and 6 women with mean age of 31.1 +/- 23.2 years (range, 4-74 years). The most common clinical manifestation was seizure (n = 11; 85%), followed by headache (n = 2; 15%). None of the tumors were incidentally detected. Eight CEs were located in the right hemisphere and 5 in the left side. The 2 most common tumor locations were the frontal (n = 5; 38%) and parietal lobe (n = 5; 38%). All patients underwent surgical resection. Gross total resection was achieved in 12 patients (92%), and subtotal resection was performed in 1 patient (8%). Ten of the 11 patients who presented with seizure are seizure-free after surgery (91% seizure-free rate). According to the World Health Organization classification system, 9 tumors (69%) were Grade II (ependymoma) and 4 (31%) were Grade III (anaplastic ependymoma). The mean follow-up was 52 months (range, 20-88 months). No recurrence was observed in patients with Grade II CEs. Of 4 patients with Grade III CEs, 2 (50%) suffered from tumor recurrence after initial treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: CEs are a rare subset of supratentorial ependymomas that selectively involve the cerebral cortex. Most CEs are low grade and present with seizures. Anaplastic CEs show a greater recurrence rate and a relatively poor prognosis. Gross total resection with or without adjuvant radiotherapy is currently the optimal treatment for CEs. CEs seem to have a more favorable prognosis than other supratentorial ependymomas.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to perform a survival analysis of patients with high-grade multicentric gliomas and to assess the influence of various prognostic factors on overall survival (OS).
   METHODS: A literature search on PubMed and Web of Science was performed for literature in English published from 1880 to October 2017. Detailed information including demographics, clinical characteristics, treatments, critical events, and time to events for survival analysis were extracted from the included articles.
   RESULTS: A total of 73 cases from 25 published articles were selected for analysis. Univariate analysis showed the surgery (SB/SR), age (<54/>= 54 years), radiotherapy (Y/N), and suprainfratentorial gliomas (Y/N) had significant correlations with OS. Multivariate analysis showed that age, surgery, and radiotherapy were independent prognostic factors. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed radiotherapy and radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors for surgical patients' OS.
   CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive analysis of multicentric glioma patients revealed that age younger than 54 years, surgical resection, and radiotherapy were significantly associated with improved survival and were independent prognostic factors for OS. Radiotherapy and radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors for surgical patients' OS as well.

AB OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively analyze the clinical data of 6 patients with foramen magnum (FM) neurenteric (NE) cysts, and summarize the clinical characteristics and treatment experience for this rare disease in our single center.
   METHODS: Between January 2011 and December 2015, 6 patients with FM NE cyst were surgically treated at Xuan Wu Hospital of Capital Medical University. We summarize the treatment experience of these patients through a retrospective review of the clinical information, imaging features, surgical details, and follow-up outcomes.
   RESULTS: All 6 patients were female, ranging in age from 15 to 54 years (mean age, 36.8 +/- 12.9 years). Occipital headache along with cranial nerve injury were the most common symptoms. Preoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging identified all lesions in the FM region, with an oblong or lobulated shape. The surgical approach was far lateral in 4 patients and suboccipital midline in 2 patients. Total lesion removal was completed in 4 patients, and subtotal excision was performed in the other 2 patients, in whom the cyst wall was intensely adherent to surrounding structures. In all 6 patients, the preoperative symptoms were significantly relieved after surgery. No recurrence was seen after a mean follow-up of 27.3 months (range, 3-70 months).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our present study identified a female predominance among patients with intracranial FM NE cyst. Surgical excision is the optimum treatment strategy for this rare disease. Our findings indicate that subtotal removal of an FM NE cyst may be associated with favorable outcomes, but strict long-term follow up is needed.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate clinical and radiologic results of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion for cervical spondylotic myelopathy in elderly patients with T2-weighted increased signal intensity (ISI), focusing specifically on the quantitative analysis of ISI.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 88 patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy with ISI who underwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with a minimum 1-year follow-up. Patients were divided into 2 groups: patients older than 65 (elderly group, 36 patients) or younger (young group, 52 patients). The Japanese Ortho-paedic Association (JOA) score was used to evaluate the neurologic status. The signal change ratio (SCR) was defined as the grayscale of ISI region divided by that at C7-T1 disc level. The C2-C7 sagittal alignment, range of motion, SCR, and ISI length were measured.
   RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in C2-C7 sagittal alignment and range of motion. However, the JOA score at 1-year follow-up and recovery rate in elderly group were significantly lower than in young group (P < 0.001). SCR and ISI length were significantly greater in elderly group than in young group, whereas their changes were significantly lower in elderly group (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that an older age, a lower preoperative JOA score, a greater preoperative SCR, and a longer preoperative ISI length at 1-year follow-up were negatively correlated with the clinical outcomes in the elderly group (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with young patients with ISI, the elderly patients had a lower preoperative JOA score, a greater preoperative SCR, and a longer preoperative ISI length, indicating poor surgical outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of sequential ligament failure on the range of motion (ROM) and location of the instantaneous axes of rotation (IAR) of the thoracolumbar spine (T12-L1) finite element (FE) model, and to verify the role of the supraspinous ligament (SSL) in maintaining the stability of the injured thoracolumbar spine.
   METHODS: An FE model of the fractured thoracolumbar Hie was developed and validated against published data. The posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) in the fractured T12-L1 segment was then reduced in a sequential manner from the facet capsular ligament (FCL), part of the interspinous ligament (ISL), SSL, and entire ISL, to the ligamentum flavum (LF). The ROM and IAR of the T12-L1 segment were measured at the fracture and at each reduced ligament step under 4 directions of flexion, extension, lateral bending, and rotation, and 4 bending motions of 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0 Nm.
   RESULTS: The FE model showed a consistent increase in ROM and location of the IAR as the ligaments were removed sequentially. Furthermore, failure of the SSL had the most significant influence on the change in the ROM and IAR in flexion. In extension, removal of the FCL caused the largest shift.
   CONCLUSIONS: The SSL is a significant ligament that JWS the PLC to maintain the stability of the thoracolumbar spine during injury.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is always a great challenge to distinguish high-grade glioma (HGG) from primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the performance of dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) in differentiating HGGs from PCNSLs.
   METHODS: Heterogeneity and threshold effect were evaluated, and sensitivity, specificity (SPE), and areas under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC) were calculated.
   RESULTS: Thirteen studies with a total of 704 participants were included in this meta-analysis. For the dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) technique, the pooled sensitivity and SPE were 0.94 and 0.84, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) under the SROC was 0.9595, and the diagnostic odds ratio was 81.880. For the susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) technique, the pooled sensitivity and SPE were 0.92 and 0.87, respectively. The AUC under the SROC was 0.9608, and the diagnostic odds ratio was 89.774. A Z test showed that no significant difference in AUC values between DSC and SWI (P = 0.97) was observed. In addition, no obvious public bias was observed in both the DSC (P = 0.69) and SWI (P = 0.32) groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis indicated that both DSC-MRI and SWI have a high and similar level of diagnostic accuracy for differentiating HGGs from PCNSLs.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features of somatotrophic adenoma in children younger than 14 years and to evaluate the short-term and long-term outcomes of transsphenoidal surgery.
   METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included 22 patients with somatotrophic adenoma who were admitted to our institution between January 1997 and January 2017. The patients' demographics, hormone levels, imaging characteristics, surgical outcomes, and follow-up data were summarized.
   RESULTS: The average age of patients at diagnosis was 10.3 years, and the average disease duration was 42.5 months. Growth acceleration was observed in 90.9% of patients. Mixed somatolactotrophic adenoma was identified in 36.4% of patients. In total, 77.3% of tumors on imaging were macroadenomas or giant adenoma, and 50% were invasive. Twenty-one patients underwent tumor resection, and the remission rate after a single transsphenoidal surgery was 45%. Preoperative growth hormone levels (P = 0.017), growth hormone nadir (P = 0.003), and tumor size (P = 0.026) were the most likely influencing factors associated with the surgical remission rate. Postoperative cerebral spinal fluid leakage (15%) was the main complication of transsphenoidal surgery. During a median follow-up period of 42.5 months, 72.7% of the patients obtained remission after monotherapy or combined treatment, and no recurrence was observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Somatotrophic adenomas in children younger than 14 years tend to be macroadenomas with a shorter disease duration than that observed in adults. Transsphenoidal surgery is safe and effective and could represent a preferred treatment option. The combination of surgery, medication, and radiation is recommended to achieve optimal long-term outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Expanded endoscopic endonasal approaches to the infratemporal fossa (ITF) are increasingly performed owing to improved visualization and less morbidity compared with classic open approaches. Only a few studies in the literature investigated lateral endoscopic access to the ITF. The aim of this study was to examine the ITF with the minimally invasive endoscopically assisted Gillies approach with a trial of its expansion through a double port technique.
   METHODS: The ITF was examined in 10 sides of 5 cadaveric heads using a lateral endoscopic assisted approach. A double portal technique was developed to allow bimanual dissection. Specific long angled skull base instruments were used for dissection under stereotactic guidance.
   RESULTS: The endoscopic assisted Gillies approach permitted minimally invasive access to the complete anteroposterior extension of the ITF with sufficient mobility of surgical instruments. A new anatomic classification for the ITF from a lateral endoscopic perspective was introduced. The addition of the second port allowed bimanual dissection.
   CONCLUSIONS: This cadaveric study shows the feasibility of an endoscopically assisted lateral approach to the ITF. The addition of a posterior port expands the approach through increasing the working area and enabling a bimanual dissection technique. Performed alone or combined with an anterior endoscopic transnasal approach, this technique offers minimally invasive access to the ITF. The development of specifically designed instruments would further improve this promising approach.

AB BACKGROUND: Chordomas are rare tumors assumed to derive from notochordal remnants. We believe that a molecular switch is responsible for their malignant behavior. The involvement of oncogenic viruses has not been studied, however. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the presence of oncogenic viruses in chordomas.
   METHODS: DNA and RNA from snap-frozen chordoma (n = 18) and chondrosarcoma in = 15) specimens were isolated. Real-time PCR or RT-PCR was performed to assess the presence of multiple oncogenic viruses, including herpesviridea (herpes simplex virus [HSV]-1, HSV-2, Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus [HHV]- 6, HHV-7, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus), polyomaviridea (parvovirus B19 [PVB19], BK virus, JC virus, Simian virus 40, Merkel cell polyomavirus, human polyomavirus [HPyV]-6, and HPyV-7), papillomaviridae, and respiratory viruses. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) were used to validate the positive results.
   RESULTS: PVB19 DNA was detected in 4 of 18 chordomas (22%) and in 1 of 15 chondrosarcomas (7%). IHC recognizing the VP2 capsid protein of PVB19 showed a positive cytoplasmic staining in 44% of the cases (14 of 32). HHV7 DNA was present in 6 of the 18 chordomas (33%). Genomic DNA of EBV was found in 22% of the samples; however, no positive results were found on ISH. None of the chordoma cases showed any presence of DNA from the remaining viruses.
   CONCLUSIONS: Viral involvement in the etiology of chordomas is likely, with PVB19 the most distinguishing.

AB BACKGROUND: The differentiation of germinoma from other tumors by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be very difficult. The purpose of our study was to determine whether diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) could provide additional useful information for a definitive diagnosis of germinomas.
   METHODS: Our hospital's Institutional Review Board approved this retrospective study. We reviewed imaging studies of 26 patients with histologically confirmed germinomas who were treated at our hospital between 2003 and 2016. We also studied 25 patients with pineal tumors, which included 14 nongerminomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCTs), 9 pineal parenchymal tumors (PPTs; including 3 pineocytomas, 4 PPTs of intermediate differentiation [PPTID], and 2 pineoblastomas) and 2 meningiomas. Patients underwent conventional MRI and advanced MRI, including DWI and/or 1H-MRS.
   RESULTS: The germinoma group comprised 24 males and 2 females, ranging in age from 9.1 to 37.7 years (average, 17.5 years; median, 14.6 years). The NGGCT group was all male, ranging in age from 5.4 to 51.9 years (mean, 20.1 years; median, 14.1 years). In the PPT group, patient age ranged from 4.5 to 64.7 years (mean, 29.9 years; median, 30.7 years). High lipid peaks detected on 1H-MRS were observed in 16 of 16 examined germinomas. In contrast, in the pineocytomas, PPTID, pineoblastomas, and meningiomas, lipid peaks were small or absent in 10 of 10 examined tumors. In the NGGCT group, high lipid peaks on 1H-MRS were observed in 11 of 12 examined tumors; however, no tumors showed high intensity on DWI, with all low to high mixed intensity. ADC was statistically lower in the germinoma group compared with the NGGCT group (P = 0.0002).
   CONCLUSIONS: Lower ADC values and high lipid peaks detected on 1H-MRS are characteristics of germinomas.

AB OBJECTIVE: Rhabdoid meningioma (RM) and papillary meningioma (PM) are rare variants of World Health Organization grade III meningiomas. In this study, we presented a series of 23 cases from our institution to investigate adverse factors of and appropriate treatment for RM and PM.
   METHODS: Clinical data from 23 cases of PM and RM between January 2011 and December 2015 were retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS: The median follow-up was 38.0 months for World Health Organization grade III meningiomas. The mean progression-free survival (PFS) was 37.6 months, with 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year PFS of 78.3%, 50.8%, and 43.6%, respectively. The mean overall survival (OS) was 48.8 months, with 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year OS of 95.7%, 82.6%, and 44.0%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that a ki-67 proliferation index >20% (hazard ratio [HR], 4.190; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 1.033-17.001; P = 0.045) and PM (HR, 3.375; 95% CI, 0.998-11.408; P = 0.005) were related to worse PFS. Patients administered postoperative radiotherapy (PRT) after surgery had longer OS than did patients who did not receive PRT (median, 60.7 vs. 35.1 months; P = 0.029). Multivariate analysis showed that PRT was an independent factor for PFS (HR, 0.147; 95% CI, 0.033-0.657; P = 0.012) and OS (HR, 0.130; 95% CI, 0.0250.691; P = 0.017) and that RM was an independent factor for PFS (HR, 7.312; 95% Cl, 1.587-33.688; P = 0.011) and OS (HR, 6.447; 95% CI, 1.310-31.740; P = 0.022).
   CONCLUSIONS: We recommended adjuvant radiation regardless of the extent of resection. Individuals with PM or RM were at increased risk of recurrence and death; appropriate treatment for these patients should be further studied, and close follow-up is needed.

AB OBJECTIVE: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is commonly associated with pathologic factors of axonopathy and demyelination resulting from neurovascular compression at the trigeminal root entry zone (REZ). Decompression surgery can relieve TN pain, likely by resolving such structural abnormalities. To test this hypothesis, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to capture the full extent of trigeminal microarchitecture changes in vivo in patients with TN.
   METHODS: Twenty-four patients with TN were compared with 28 controls. DTI metrics of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean, parallel, and perpendicular diffusivities (MD, lambda(parallel to), and lambda(perpendicular to), respectively) were calculated in isolation at each trigeminal REZ. In 6 patients with pain relief following decompression surgery, repeated studies were performed 2 times (1 week and 4-6 months) after surgery to detect dynamic changes in FA, MD, lambda(parallel to), and lambda(perpendicular to).
   RESULTS: We observed significant FA reductions and increased diffusivity at the affected trigeminal REZ, corresponding to known underlying pathologic changes, including axonal edema and demyelination. Specifically, our results showed that these DTI-derived metrics are discriminating features for patients with TN according to the support vector machine approach. After effective treatment, diffusion recovery at 1 week was mainly due to the decrease in lambda(parallel to) (consistent with axonal membrane stabilization), whereas at 4-6 months it was due to the predominant reduction in lambda(perpendicular to). (consistent with remyelination).
   CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results support that DTI permits the noninvasive detection of the trigeminal microstructurel abnormalities underlying TN in vivo, and DTI-derived metrics could be considered surrogate markers of the axonal and myelin states for monitoring patients.

AB BACKGROUND: The biopsy is recognized as the most accurate method to determine the histologic characterization of sellar germ cell tumors. It is difficult to evaluate the prognosis before histologic confirmation.
   OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the independent prognostic risk factors of patients with sellar germ cell tumors (GCTs).
   METHODS: From January 2008 to December 2015, 61 patients who were histologically diagnosed as having sellar GCTs were followed up and were included in this retrospective study.
   RESULTS: Of 61 patients in this study, 40 (65.6%), 10 (16.4%), and 11 (18.0%) were diagnosed as having pure germinomas, germinomas with syncytiotrophoblastic giant cells and non-germinomatous GCTs (NGGCTs), respectively. The patients with pure germinomas had a significantly better overall survival time than did those with NGGCT (56.47 +/- 3.01 months vs. 43.09 +/- 10.58 months; P = 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that the independent poor prognostic risk factors of patients with sellar GCTs were diameters >15 mm (odds ratio [013], 7.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.01-27.19), octamer-binding transcription positivity (OR, 5.97; 95% CI, 1.40-25.48), and NGGCT (OR, 11.88; 95% CL 2.37-59.50), whereas the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy was associated with a better prognosis (OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.04-0.55).
   CONCLUSIONS: Diameter >15 mm, octamer-binding transcription positivity, or NGGCT was associated with a poorer prognosis for patients with sellar GCTs, whereas the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy was associated with a better prognosis.

ID SUPERIOR AURICULAR ARTERY; FACIAL DEFECTS; CRANIOPLASTY; COMPLICATIONS
AB BACKGROUND: Skin ulcers and alloplastic implant exposure are intractable complications that arise after cranial defect reconstruction. Many methods have been used to repair these defects, including skin grafting, local flaps, and free flaps; however, in most cases, alloplastic implants must be removed to control infections. Here, we describe the use of a reversed temporal island flap to repair exposed titanium mesh without removing it.
   METHODS: Eight cases of skin and titanium mesh exposure were included from 2010 to 2015. A preauricular flap pedicled on the reversed superficial temporal artery was designed to repair forehead defects. The titanium mesh was retained, resterilized, and reimplanted.
   RESULTS: Flaps were survived completely, and the titanium meshes were reimplanted with no complications. The results were aesthetically and functionally sufficient, with minimal donor-site morbidity in all cases during the 10- to 24-month follow-up period.
   CONCLUSIONS: The described method is easy to design and perform. The flap has a reliable blood supply to help fight infection. The titanium mesh is preserved completely, avoiding a second cranioplasty.

   METHODS: Between July 2009 and April 2016, 14 patients with MCADAs received endovascular treatment. MCADAs were identified by their unique radiographic features on cerebral angiography. Baseline characteristics, angiographic features, and angiographic and clinical outcomes were analyzed retrospectively.
   RESULTS: All 14 MCADAs (including 6 ruptured and 8 unruptured) were successfully treated with the endovascular approach. Stent-assisted coiling was used in 12 cases, coil alone in 1 case, and parent vessel occlusion in 1 case. Angiographic follow-up data were available for all patients at 6 months after treatment. Of 14 MCADAs, 10 were completely occluded, and 4 were improved (near occlusion). All parent arteries and covered perforators remained patent in the non-parent vessel occlusion group. No ischemic strokes or other complications were observed at 1-year clinical follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that endovascular treatment of 14 MCADAs appears to be safe and effective. The choice of treatment method needs to be individualized. Larger studies are required to evaluate these promising results.

AB Most hydrological analysis and modeling studies require reliable and accurate precipitation data for successful simulations. However, precipitation measurements should be more representative of the true precipitation distribution. Many approaches and techniques are used to collect precipitation data. Recently, hydrometeorological and climatological applications of satellite precipitation products have experienced a significant improvement with the emergence of the latest satellite products, namely, the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission (IMERG) products, which can be utilized to estimate and analyze precipitation data. This study focuses on the validation of the IMERG early, late and final run rainfall products using ground-based rain gauge observations throughout Saudi Arabia for the period from October 2015 to April 2016. The accuracy of each IMERG product is assessed using six statistical performance measures to conduct three main evaluations, namely, regional, event-based and station-based evaluations. The results indicate that the early run product performed well in the middle and eastern parts as well as some of the western parts of the country; meanwhile, the satellite estimates for the other parts fluctuated between an overestimation and an underestimation. The late run product showed an improved accuracy over the southern and western parts; however, over the northern and middle parts, it showed relatively high errors. The final run product revealed significantly improved precipitation estimations and successfully obtained higher accuracies over most parts of the country. This study provides an early assessment of the performance of the GPM satellite products over the Middle East. The study findings can be used as a beneficial reference for the future development of the IMERG algorithms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Agricultural irrigation with trans-basin water diversion can effectively relieve the water paucity in arid and semi-arid regions, however, this may be accompanied by eco-environmental problems (e.g., saline soils, rising groundwater levels, water quality problems). The mechanism of soil water movement under irrigation in the unsaturated zone of arid regions is a key scientific problem that should be solved in order to evaluate agricultural water management and further improve current irrigation practices. This study investigated the impact of drip irrigation on soil water movement in the unsaturated zone of a cotton field in an inland arid region (the Karamay Agricultural Development Area), northwest China. Combining in situ observational physical data with temporal variation in stable isotopic compositions of soil water, we described the soil water flow system and mechanism in severe (Plot 1) and mild (Plot 2) saline-alkali cotton fields. The infiltration depths are 0-150 cm for both plots, Drip irrigation scheduling makes no significant contribution to local groundwater recharge, however, groundwater can move into the unsaturated zone through capillary rise during cotton flowering and boll periods. Plot 2 is less prone to having secondary soil salinization than Plot I due to the existence of a middle layer (approximately 100 cm thick), which elongated the distance between the root zone and aquifer. Rise in the water table (approximately 60 cm for Plot 1 and 50 cm for Plot 2) could be caused by lateral groundwater flow instead of vertical infiltration. We estimated the soil water storage changes in the unsaturated zone and proposed a conceptual model for deciphering the movement process of soil water. This study provides a scientific basis for determining the rise of groundwater levels and potential development of saline soils and improving agricultural water management in arid regions.

AB Climate variability and anthropogenic regulations are two interwoven factors in the ecohydrologic system across large basins. Understanding the roles that these two factors play under various hydrologic conditions is of great significance for basin hydrology and sustainable water utilization. In this study, we present an analytical approach based on coupling water balance method and Budyko hypothesis to derive effectiveness coefficients (ECs) of climate change, as a way to disentangle contributions of it and human activities to the variability of river discharges under different hydro-transitional situations. The climate dominated streamflow change (Delta Q(c)) by EC approach was compared with those deduced by the elasticity method and sensitivity index. The results suggest that the EC approach is valid and applicable for hydrologic study at large basin scale. Analyses of various scenarios revealed that contributions of climate change and human activities to river discharge variation differed among the regions of the study area. Over the past several decades, climate change dominated hydro-transitions from dry to wet, while human activities played key roles in the reduction of streamflow during wet to dry periods. Remarkable decline of discharge in upstream was mainly due to human interventions, although climate contributed more to runoff increasing during dry periods in the semi-arid downstream. Induced effectiveness on streamflow changes indicated a contribution ratio of 49% for climate and 51% for human activities at the basin scale from 1956 to 2015. The mathematic derivation based simple approach, together with the case example of temporal segmentation and spatial zoning, could help people understand variation of river discharge with more details at a large basin scale under the background of climate change and human regulations.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DE Analytical solution; Pumping in discrete fractures; Fractured rocks;
   Pumping test
ID HARD-ROCK AQUIFERS; HYDRAULIC TESTS; FLOW; BEHAVIOR
AB The behaviour of transient flow due to pumping in fractured rocks has been studied for at least the past 80 years. Analytical solutions were proposed for solving the issue of a well intersecting and pumping from one vertical, horizontal or inclined fracture in homogeneous aquifers, but their domain of application even if covering various fracture geometries was restricted to isotropic or anisotropic aquifers, whose potential boundaries had to be parallel or orthogonal to the fracture direction. The issue thus remains unsolved for many field cases. For example, a well intersecting and pumping a fracture in a multilayer or a dual-porosity aquifer, where intersected fractures are not necessarily parallel or orthogonal to aquifer boundaries, where several fractures with various orientations intersect the well, or the effect of pumping not only in fractures, but also in the aquifer through the screened interval of the well.
   Using a mathematical demonstration, we show that integrating the well-known Theis analytical solution (Theis, 1935) along the fracture axis is identical to the equally well-known analytical solution of Gringarten et al. (1974) for a uniform-flux fracture fully penetrating a homogeneous aquifer. This result implies that any existing line- or point-source solution can be used for implementing one or more discrete fractures that are intersected by the well. Several theoretical examples are presented and discussed: a single vertical fracture in a dual-porosity aquifer or in a multi-layer system (with a partially intersecting fracture); one and two inclined fractures in a leaky-aquifer system with pumping either only from the fracture(s), or also from the aquifer between fracture(s) in the screened interval of the well. For the cases with several pumping sources, analytical solutions of flowrate contribution from each individual source (fractures and well) are presented, and the drawdown behaviour according to the length of the pumped screened interval of the well is discussed. Other advantages of this proposed generic analytical solution are also given.
   The application of this solution to field data should provide additional field information on fracture geometry, as well as identifying the connectivity between the pumped fractures and other aquifers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As a key policy tool, water diplomacy offers greater political engagement in the cooperative management of shared water. A range of initiatives has been dedicated to this end, almost invariably oriented around the interactions of nation states. Crucially, however, practitioners of water diplomacy also need to address water governance at sub-state levels. As a political, multi-level, and normative field, peace and conflict research offers a pluralism of approaches designed to bring actors together at all levels. Drawing upon this research, this paper offers new focal points for water diplomacy that can enhance its policy effectiveness and enrich its underlying academic current. More specifically, it presents three hitherto undervalued tools for water diplomacy: at the interstate level, to uncover the rich body of political norms that bind states to shared understandings of acceptable practice around water. At the intrastate level, to incorporate ethnography of water users and civil society groups' responses to state-led waterworks projects, and at the communal level to employ disaggregated georeferenced data on water resources in conflict-prone areas. Taken together, these analytical tools provide a multi-faceted political gauge of the dynamics of water diplomacy, and add vital impetus to develop water diplomacy across multiple levels of policy engagement.

DE Prediction uncertainty; Groundwater; Transport modelling; Upscaling
ID LOCAL-GRID REFINEMENT; SHARED NODES; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS
AB The application of global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis techniques to groundwater models of deep sedimentary basins are typically challenged by large computational burdens combined with associated numerical stability issues. The highly parameterized approaches required for exploring the predictive uncertainty associated with the heterogeneous hydraulic characteristics of multiple aquifers and aquitards in these sedimentary basins exacerbate these issues. A novel Patch Modelling Methodology is proposed for improving the computational feasibility of stochastic modelling analysis of large-scale and complex groundwater models. The method incorporates a nested groundwater modelling framework that enables efficient simulation of groundwater flow and transport across multiple spatial and temporal scales. The method also allows different processes to be simulated within different model scales. Existing nested model methodologies are extended by employing 'joining predictions' for extrapolating prediction-salient information from one model scale to the next. This establishes a feedback mechanism supporting the transfer of information from child models to parent models as well as parent models to child models in a computationally efficient manner. This feedback mechanism is simple and flexible and ensures that while the salient small scale features influencing larger scale prediction are transferred back to the larger scale, this does not require the live coupling of models. This method allows the modelling of multiple groundwater flow and transport processes using separate groundwater models that are built for the appropriate spatial and temporal scales, within a stochastic framework, while also removing the computational burden associated with live model coupling. The utility of the method is demonstrated by application to an actual large scale aquifer injection scheme in Australia. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rainfall networks are the most direct sources of precipitation data and their optimization and evaluation are essential and important. Information entropy can not only represent the uncertainty of rainfall distribution but can also reflect the correlation and information transmission between rainfall stations. Using entropy this study performs optimization of rainfall networks that are of similar size located in two big cities in China, Shanghai (in Yangtze River basin) and Xi'an (in Yellow River basin), with respect to temporal variability analysis. Through an easy-to-implement greedy ranking algorithm based on the criterion called, Maximum Information Minimum Redundancy (MIMR), stations of the networks in the two areas (each area is further divided into two subareas) are ranked during sliding inter-annual series and under different meteorological conditions. It is found that observation series with different starting days affect the ranking, alluding to the temporal variability during network evaluation. We propose a dynamic network evaluation framework for considering temporal variability, which ranks stations under different starting days with a fixed time window (1-year, 2-year, and 5-year). Therefore, we can identify rainfall stations which are temporarily of importance or redundancy and provide some useful suggestions for decision makers. The proposed framework can serve as a supplement for the primary MIMR optimization approach. In addition, during different periods (wet season or dry season) the optimal network from MIMR exhibits differences in entropy values and the optimal network from wet season tended to produce higher entropy values. Differences in spatial distribution of the optimal networks suggest that optimizing the rainfall network for changing meteorological conditions may be more recommended. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Under the effects of global change, water crisis ranks as the top global risk in the future decade, and water conflict in transboundary river basins as well as the geostrategic competition led by it is most concerned. This study presents an innovative integrated PPMGWO model of water resources optimization allocation in a transboundary river basin, which is integrated through the projection pursuit model (PPM) and Grey wolf optimization (GWO) method. This study uses the Songhua River basin and 25 control units as examples, adopting the PPMGWO model proposed in this study to allocate the water quantity. Using water consumption in all control units in the Songhua River basin in 2015 as reference to compare with optimization allocation results of firefly algorithm (FA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms as well as the PPMGWO model, results indicate that the average difference between corresponding allocation results and reference values are 0.195 bil m(3), 0.151 bil m(3), and 0.085 bil m(3), respectively. Obviously, the average difference of the PPMGWO model is the lowest and its optimization allocation result is closer to reality, which further confirms the reasonability, feasibility, and accuracy of the PPMGWO model. And then the PPMGWO model is adopted to simulate allocation of available water quantity in Songhua River basin in 2018, 2020, and 2030. The simulation results show water quantity which could be allocated in all controls demonstrates an overall increasing trend with reasonable and equal exploitation and utilization of water resources in the Songhua River basin in future. In addition, this study has a certain reference value and application meaning to comprehensive management and water resources allocation in other transboundary river basins. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Wetlands are important ecosystems that provide many ecological benefits, and their quality and presence are protected by federal regulations. These regulations require wetland delineations, which can be costly and time-consuming to perform. Computer models can assist in this process, but lack the accuracy necessary for environmental planning-scale wetland identification. In this study, the potential for improvement of wetland identification models through modification of digital elevation model (DEM) derivatives, derived from high-resolution and increasingly available light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, at a scale necessary for small-scale wetland delineations is evaluated. A novel approach of flow convergence modelling is presented where Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), curvature, and Cartographic Depth-to-Water index (DTW), are modified to better distinguish wetland from upland areas, combined with ancillary soil data, and used in a Random Forest classification. This approach is applied to four study sites in Virginia, implemented as an ArcGIS model. The model resulted in significant improvement in average wetland accuracy compared to the commonly used National Wetland Inventory (84.9% vs. 32.1%), at the expense of a moderately lower average non-wetland accuracy (85.6% vs. 98.0%) and average overall accuracy (85.6% vs. 92.0%). From this, we concluded that modifying TWI, curvature, and DTW provides more robust wetland and non-wetland signatures to the models by improving accuracy rates compared to classifications using the original indices. The resulting ArcGIS model is a general tool able to modify these local LiDAR DEM derivatives based on site characteristics to identify wetlands at a high resolution. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The idea of the Weighted Function (WF) method for estimation of Pearson type 3 (Pe3) distribution introduced by Ma in 1984 has been revised and successfully applied for shifted inverse Gaussian (IGa3) distribution. Also the conditions of WF applicability to a shifted distribution have been formulated.
   The accuracy of WF flood quantiles for both Pe3 and IGa3 distributions was assessed by Monte Caro simulations under the true and false distribution assumption versus the maximum likelihood (MLM), moment (MOM) and L-moments (LMM) methods. Three datasets of annual peak flows of Polish catchments serve the case studies to compare the results of the WF, MOM, MLM and LMM performance for the real flood data. For the hundred-year flood the WF method revealed the explicit superiority only over the MLM surpassing the MOM and especially LMM both for the true and false distributional assumption with respect to relative bias and relative mean root square error values. Generally, the WF method performs well and for hydrological sample size and constitutes good alternative for the estimation of the flood upper quantiles. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Classification and similarity based methods, which have recently received major attention in the field of surface water hydrology, namely through the PUB (prediction in ungauged basins) initiative, have not yet been applied to groundwater systems. However, it can be hypothesised, that the principle of "similar systems responding similarly to similar forcing" applies in subsurface hydrology as well. One fundamental prerequisite to test this hypothesis and eventually to apply the principle to make "predictions for ungauged groundwater systems" is efficient methods to quantify the similarity of groundwater system responses, i.e. groundwater hydrographs. In this study, a large, spatially extensive, as well as geologically and geomorphologically diverse dataset from Southern Germany and Western Austria was used, to test and compare a set of 32 grouping methods, which have previously only been used individually in local scale studies. The resulting groupings are compared to a heuristic visual classification, which serves as a baseline. A performance ranking of these classification methods is carried out and differences in homogeneity of grouping results were shown, whereby selected groups were related to hydrogeological indices and geological descriptors. This exploratory empirical study shows that the choice of grouping method has a large impact on the object distribution within groups, as well as on the homogeneity of patterns captured in groups. The study provides a comprehensive overview of a large number of grouping methods, which can guide researchers when attempting similarity-based groundwater hydrograph classification.

AB Using a moisture tracking model with 32-year reanalysis data and station precipitation observations, we diagnosed the sources of moisture for summer (June 1-August 31) precipitation in mid-lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). Results indicate the dominant role of oceanic evaporation compared to terrestrial evapotranspiration, and the previously overlooked southern Indian Ocean, as a source region, is found to contribute more moisture than the well-known Arabian Sea or Bay of Bengal. Terrestrial evapotranspiration appears to be important for summer precipitation, especially in early June when moisture contribution is more than 50%. The terrestrial contribution then decreases and is generally less than 40% after late June. The Indian Ocean is the most important oceanic source before mid-July, with its largest contribution during the period of heavy precipitation, while the Pacific Ocean becomes the more important oceanic source after mid-July. To quantitatively analyze paths of moisture transport to YRB, we proposed the Trajectory Frequency Method. The most intense branch of water vapor transport to YRB stretches from the Arabian Sea through the Bay of Bengal, the Indochina Peninsula, the South China Sea, and South China. The other main transport branches are westerly moisture fluxes to the south of the Tibetan Plateau, cross-equatorial flows north of Australia, and separate branches located in the north and equatorial Pacific Ocean. Significant intraseasonal variability for these branches is presented. Additionally, the importance of the South China Sea for moisture transport to YRB, especially from the sea areas, is emphasized.

AB This study uses daily rainfall records of a dense network of 240 gauges in central Arizona to gain insights on (i) the variability of the seasonal distributions of rainfall extremes; (ii) how the seasonal distributions affect the shape of the annual distribution; and (iii) the presence of spatial patterns and orographic control for these distributions. For this aim, recent methodological advancements in peak-over-threshold analysis and application of the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) were used to assess the suitability of the GPD hypothesis and improve the estimation of its parameters, while limiting the effect of short sample sizes. The distribution of daily rainfall extremes was found to be heavy-tailed (i.e., GPD shape parameter xi > 0) during the summer season, dominated by convective monsoonal thunderstorms. The exponential distribution (a special case of GPD with xi = 0) was instead showed to be appropriate for modeling wintertime daily rainfall extremes, mainly caused by cold fronts transported by westerly flow. The annual distribution exhibited a mixed behavior, with lighter upper tails than those found in summer. A hybrid model mixing the two seasonal distributions was demonstrated capable of reproducing the annual distribution. Organized spatial patterns, mainly controlled by elevation, were observed for the GPD scale parameter, while xi did not show any clear control of location or orography. The quantiles returned by the GPD were found to be very similar to those provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Atlas 14, which used the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. Results of this work are useful to improve statistical modeling of daily rainfall extremes at high spatial resolution and provide diagnostic tools for assessing the ability of climate models to simulate extreme events.

AB As sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, integrated urban drainage systems (IUDSs) (i.e., sewer systems, wastewater treatment plants and receiving water bodies) contribute to climate change. This paper, produced by the International Working Group on Data and Models, which works under the IWA/IAHR Joint Committee on Urban Drainage, reviews the state-of-the-art and modelling tools developed recently to understand and manage GHG emissions from IUDS. Further, open problems and research gaps are discussed and a framework for handling GHG emissions from IUDSs is presented. The literature review reveals that there is a need to strengthen already available mathematical models for IUDS to take GHG into account. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge about the hydrological regime of wetlands is key to understand their physical and biological properties. Modelling hydrological and hydrodynamic processes within a wetland is therefore becoming increasingly important. 3D models have successfully modelled wetland dynamics but depend on very detailed bathymetry and land topography. Many 1D and 2D models of river deltas highly simplify the interaction between the river and wetland area or simply neglect the wetland area. This study proposes an enhanced quasi-2D modelling strategy that captures the interaction between river discharge and moon tides and the resulting hydrodynamics, while using the scarce data available. The water flow equations are discretised with an interconnected irregular cell scheme, in which a simplification of the 1D Saint-Venant equations is used to define the water flow between cells. The spatial structure of wetlands is based on the ecogeomorphology in complex estuarine deltas. The islands within the delta are modelled with levee cells, creek cells and an interior cell representing a shallow marsh wetland. The model is calibrated for an average year and the model performance is evaluated for another average year and additionally an extreme dry three-month period and an extreme wet three-month period. The calibration and evaluation are done based on two water level measurement stations and two discharge measurement stations, all located in the main rivers. Additional calibration is carried out with field water level measurements in a wetland area. Accurate simulations are obtained for both calibration and evaluation with high correlations between observed and simulated water levels and simulated discharges in the same order of magnitude as observed discharges. Calibration against field measurements showed that the model can successfully simulate the overflow mechanism in wetland areas. A sensitivity analysis for several wetland parameters showed that these parameters are all influencing the water level fluctuation within the wetlands to varying degrees. The enhanced quasi-2D model has the potential to accurately simulate river and wetland dynamics for large wetland areas and help to understand their hydrodynamics. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Multi-objective hydrological model calibration can represent a valuable solution to reduce model equifinality and parameter uncertainty. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model is widely applied to investigate water quality and water management issues in alpine catchments. However, the model calibration is generally based on discharge records only, and most of the previous studies have defined a unique set of snow parameters for an entire basin. Only a few studies have considered snow observations to validate model results or have taken into account the possible variability of snow parameters for different subbasins. This work presents and compares three possible calibration approaches. The first two procedures are single-objective calibration procedures, for which all parameters of the SWAT model were calibrated according to river discharge alone. Procedures I and II differ from each other by the assumption used to define snow parameters: The first approach assigned a unique set of snow parameters to the entire basin, whereas the second approach assigned different subbasin-specific sets of snow parameters to each subbasin. The third procedure is a multi-objective calibration, in which we considered snow water equivalent (SWE) information at two different spatial scales (i.e. subbasin and elevation band), in addition to discharge measurements. We tested these approaches in the Upper Adige river basin where a dense network of snow depth measurement stations is available. Only the set of parameters obtained with this multi-objective procedure provided an acceptable prediction of both river discharge and SWE. These findings offer the large community of SWAT users a strategy to improve SWAT modeling in alpine catchments. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A quantitative framework for characterizing the intensity of the water cycle over land is presented, and illustrated using a spatially distributed water-balance model of the conterminous United States (CONUS). We approach water cycle intensity (WCI) from a landscape perspective; WCI is defined as the sum of precipitation (P) and actual evapotranspiration (AET) over a spatially explicit landscape unit of interest, averaged over a specified time period (step) of interest. The time step may be of any length for which data or simulation results are available (e.g., sub-daily to multi-decadal). We define the storage-adjusted runoff (Q') as the sum of actual runoff (Q) and the rate of change in soil moisture storage (Delta S/Delta t, positive or negative) during the time step of interest. The Q' indicator is demonstrated to be mathematically complementary to WCI, in a manner that allows graphical interpretation of their relationship. For the purposes of this study, the indicators were demonstrated using long-term, spatially distributed model simulations with an annual time step. WCI was found to increase over most of the CONUS between the 1945 to 1974 and 1985 to 2014 periods, driven primarily by increases in P. In portions of the western and southeastern CONUS, Q decreased because of decreases in Q and soil moisture storage. Analysis of WCI and Q at temporal scales ranging from sub-daily to multi-decadal could improve understanding of the wide spectrum of hydrologic responses that have been attributed to water cycle intensification, as well as trends in those responses.

AB Nitrate contamination of groundwater in agricultural areas poses a major challenge to the sustainability of water resources. Aquifer vulnerability models are useful tools that can help resource managers identify areas of concern, but quantifying nitrogen (N) inputs in such models is challenging, especially at large spatial scales. We sought to improve regional nitrate (NO3-) input functions by characterizing unsaturated zone NO3- transport to groundwater through use of surrogate, machine-learning metamodels of a process-based N flux model. The metamodels used boosted regression trees (BRTs) to relate mappable landscape variables to parameters and outputs of a previous "vertical flux method" (VFM) applied at sampled wells in the Fox, Wolf, and Peshtigo (FWP) river basins in northeastern Wisconsin. In this context, the metamodels upscaled the VFM results throughout the region, and the VFM parameters and outputs are the metamodel response variables. The study area encompassed the domain of a detailed numerical model that provided additional predictor variables, including groundwater recharge, to the metamodels. We used a statistical learning framework to test a range of model complexities to identify suitable hyperparameters of the six BRT meta models corresponding to each response variable of interest: NO source concentration factor (which determines the local NO input concentration); unsaturated zone travel time; NO3- concentration at the water table in 1980, 2000, and 2020 (three separate metamodels); and NO3- "extinction depth", the eventual steady state depth of the NO3- front. The final metamodels were trained to 129 wells within the active numerical flow model area, and considered 58 mappable predictor variables compiled in a geographic information system (GIS). These metamodels had training and cross-validation testing R-2 values of 0.52-0.86 and 0.22-0.38, respectively, and predictions were compiled as maps of the above response variables. Testing performance was reasonable, considering that we limited the metamodel predictor variables to mappable factors as opposed to using all available VFM input variables. Relationships between metamodel predictor variables and mapped outputs were generally consistent with expectations, e.g. with greater source concentrations and NO3- at the groundwater table in areas of intensive crop use and well drained soils. Shorter unsaturated zone travel times in poorly drained areas likely indicated preferential flow through clay soils, and a tendency for fine grained deposits to collocate with areas of shallower water table. Numerical estimates of groundwater recharge were important in the metamodels and may have been a proxy for N input and redox conditions in the northern FWP, which had shallow predicted NO3- extinction depth. The metamodel results provide proof-of-concept for regional characterization of unsaturated zone NO3- transport processes in a statistical framework based on readily mappable GIS input variables.

AB Reaction-infiltration instability, in which chemical reactions can dissolve minerals and therefore create preferential pore-fluid flow channels in fluid-saturated rocks, may play an important role in controlling groundwater quality in groundwater hydrology. Although this topic has been studied for many years, there is a recent debate, which says that the use of large-density asymptotics in the previous studies is invalid. However, there is a crucial conceptual mistake in this debate, which leads to results and conclusions that are inconsistent with the fundamental laws of physics. It is well known that in terms of distance, time and velocity, there are only two independent variables. But they are treated as three independent variables, a procedure that is the main source of the physically unrealistic results and conclusions in the debate. In this paper, we will discuss the results and conclusions related to the debate, with emphasis on the issues leading to the corresponding errors. In particular, we demonstrate that there is an unappreciated constraint condition between the dimensional/dimensionless distance, time and velocity in the debate. By using this constraint condition, it can be confirmed that as the ratio of the reactant concentration in the incoming fluid stream to the mineral concentration approaches zero, the dimensionless transport parameter, H, automatically approaches infinity. Therefore, it is further confirmed that the previous work conducted by Chadam and others remains valid. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillation indexes on the constructed prediction intervals are also examined. Performance of the proposed approach is evaluated for the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) obtained from Konya closed basin located in Central Anatolia, Turkey.

AB As the only connecting term between water balance and energy budget in the earth-atmospheric system, evapotranspiration (ET) is considered the most excellent indicator for the activity for the water and energy cycle. Under the background of global change, regional ET estimates, components partitioning as well as their spatial and temporal patterns recognition are of great importance in understanding the hydrological processes and improving water management practices. This is particularly true for the Tibetan Plateau (TP), one of most sensitive and vulnerable region in response to the environment change in the earth. In this study, with flux site observation data and monthly ET data from the monthly water balance method incorporating the terrestrial water storage changes from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite (GRACE) production as the multiple validations, the long-term daily ET in the TP was retrieved by a modified Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML) model with considering evapotranspiration over snow covered area during 1982-2012. The spatial and temporal changes of partitioned three components of ET, i.e., soil evaporation (E-s), transpiration through the stomata of plant (Er) and canopy interception (E-i), were investigated in the TP. Meanwhile, how the ET components contribute to ET changes and respond to the change in environmental factors in the TP was revealed and discussed. The results indicate that E-s dominates ET in most areas of the TP with the mean annual ratio of 65.7%, except southeastern regions where the vegetation coverage is high. Although regional average ET and three main components all present obvious increase trends during the past decades, high spatial heterogeneity for their trends are identified in the TP. Moreover, a mixed changing pattern can be apparently found for E-s in southeastern area, E-c and E-i in northwestern and southeastern area. Spatially, the ET variation are mainly attributed to change in E-s, followed by E-c and E-i. In addition, compared with evaporation related meteorological variables, precipitation and leaf area index (LAI) provide the more dominated contributions to the changes of ET and E-i in the TP, while LAI is overwhelming contribution factor for E-c changes. As for E-s changes, although precipitation play the important role, the effects of other factors are also non-negligible. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mismanagement has caused the overexploitation of one third of the major aquifers in Mexico, mainly due to excessive water extraction for agricultural irrigation. Santo Domingo (Baja California Sur, in northern Mexico, where agriculture absorbs nearly 80% of water) is the only aquifer in the Mexico where, after a period of overexploitation, equality between extraction and recharge rates was achieved, although this has not meant the securement of long-term water availability. This paper offers an analysis of hydrological resilience of a water-limited arid ecosystem under future extraction scenarios and changing climate conditions. A regional groundwater flow model is proposed using MODFLOW software. Then, different indicators were modeled as outcomes of coupled human-water systems to predict water trajectories under different human impacts. The aim was to recognize water insecurity scenarios and define appropriate actions to a more sustainable use of this scarce resource in the region. Thus, although runoff derived from extreme floods may favor infiltration, the involvement of local stakeholders and decision makers to reverse the adverse impacts of current water management and climate change is imperative if water availability and better quality are to be secured.

AB To understand the characteristics of Ca isotope composition and fractionation in silicate-dominated Quaternary aquifer system, hydrochemical and isotope studies (Sr-87/Sr-86, C-13(DIC) and Ca-44/40) were conducted on groundwater, sediment and rock samples from the Datong basin, China. Along the groundwater flow path from the basin margin to the center, groundwater hydrochemical type evolves from Ca-HCO3 to Na-HCO3/Na-Cl type, which results from aluminosilicate hydrolysis, vertical mixing, cation exchange between CaX2 and NaX, and calcite/dolomite precipitation. These processes cause the decrease in groundwater Ca concentration and the associated modest fractionation of groundwater Ca isotopes along the flowpath. The groundwater delta Ca-44/40 value varies from -0.11 to 0.49%, The elevated delta Ca-44/40 ratios in shallow groundwater are attributed to vertical mixing involving addition of irrigation water, which had the average delta Ca-44/40 ratio of 0.595 parts per thousand.. Chemical weathering of silicate minerals and carbonate generates depleted delta Ca-44/40 signatures in groundwater from Heng Mountain (east area) and Huanghua Uplift (west area), respectively. Along the groundwater flow path from Heng Mountain to central area of east area, cation exchange between CaX2 and NaX on clay mineral results in the enrichment of heavier Ca isotope in groundwater. All groundwater samples are oversaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite. The groundwater environment rich in organic matter promotes the precipitation of carbonate minerals via the biodegradation of organic carbon, thereby further promoting the elevation of groundwater delta Ca-44/40 ratios.

AB In coupled sewer and surface flood modelling approaches, the flow process in gullies is often ignored although the overland flow is drained to sewer network via inlets and gullies. Therefore, the flow entering inlets is transferred to the sewer network immediately, which may lead to a different flood estimation than the reality. In this paper, we compared two modelling approach with and without considering the flow processes in gullies in the coupled sewer and surface modelling. Three historical flood events were adopted for model calibration and validation. The results showed that the inclusion of flow process in gullies can further improve the accuracy of urban flood modelling. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Despite advancements in developing physics-based formulations to estimate the sheet-flow travel time (t(SHF)), the quantification of the relative impacts of influential parameters on t(SHF) has not previously been considered. In this study, a brief review of the physics-based formulations to estimate t(SHF) including kinematic wave (K-W) theory in combination with Manning's roughness (K-M) and with Darcy-Weisbach friction formula (K-D) over single and multiple planes is provided. Then, the relative significance of input parameters to the developed approaches is quantified by a density-based global sensitivity analysis (GSA). The performance of K-M considering zero-upstream and uniform flow depth (so-called K-M1 and K-M2), and K-D formulae to estimate the t(SHF) over single plane surface were assessed using several sets of experimental data collected from the previous studies. The compatibility of the developed models to estimate t(SHF) over multiple planes considering temporal rainfall distributions of Natural Resources Conservation Service, NRCS (I, Ia, II, and III) are scrutinized by several real-world examples. The results obtained demonstrated that the main controlling parameters of t(SHF) through K-D and K-M formulae are the length of surface plane (mean sensitivity index (T) over cap (i) = 0.72) and flow resistance (mean (T) over cap (i) = 0.52), respectively. Conversely, the flow temperature and initial abstraction ratio of rainfall have the lowest influence on t(SHF) (mean (T) over cap (i) is 0.11 and 0.12, respectively). The significant role of the flow regime on the estimation of t(SHF) over a single and a cascade of planes are also demonstrated. Results reveal that the K-D formulation provides more precise t(SHF) over the single plane surface with an average percentage of error, APE equal to 9.23% (the APE for K-M1 and K-M2 formulae were 13.8%, and 36.33%, respectively). The superiority of Manning-jointed formulae in estimation of t(SHF) is due to the incorporation of effects from different flow regimes as flow moves downgradient that is affected by one or more factors including high excess rainfall intensities, low flow resistance, high degrees of imperviousness, long surfaces, steep slope, and domination of rainfall distribution as NRCS Type I, II, or III.

AB Changes in the stable isotope composition of water can, with the aid of climatic parameters, be used to calculate the quantity of evaporation from a water body. Previous workers have mostly focused on small, research catchments, with abundant data, but of limited scope. This study aimed to expand such work to a regional or sub-continental scale. The first full length isotope survey of the Gariep River quantifies evaporation on the river and the man-made reservoirs for the first time, and proposes a technique to calculate abstraction from the river. The theoretically determined final isotope composition for an evaporating water body in the given climate lies on the empirically determined local evaporation line, validating the assumptions and inputs to the Craig-Gordon evaporation model that was used. Evaporation from the Gariep River amounts to around 20% of flow, or 40 m(3)/s, of which about half is due to evaporation from the surface of the Gariep and Vanderkloof Reservoirs, showing the wastefulness of large surface water impoundments. This compares well with previous estimates based on evapotranspiration calculations, and equates to around 1300 GL/a of water, or about the annual water consumption of Johannesburg and Pretoria, where over 10 million people reside. Using similar evaporation calculations and applying existing transpiration estimates to a gauged length of river, the remaining quantity can be attributed to abstraction, amounting to 175 L/s/km in the lower middle reaches of the river. Given that high water demand and climate change are global problems, and with the challenges of maintaining water monitoring networks, stable isotopes are shown to be applicable over regional to national scales for modelling hydrological flows. Stable isotopes provide a complementary method to conventional flow gauging for understanding hydrology and management of large water resources, particularly in arid areas subject to significant evaporation.

AB The paper investigates the applicability of Kinematic and Diffusive Wave models for mud-flows with a power-law shear-thinning rheology. In analogy with a well-known approach for turbulent clear-water flows, the study compares the steady flow depth profiles predicted by approximated models with those of the Full Dynamic Wave one. For all the models and assuming an infinitely wide channel, the analytical solution of the flow depth profiles, in terms of hypergeometric functions, is derived. The accuracy of the approximated models is assessed by computing the average, along the channel length, of the errors, for several values of the Froude and kinematic wave numbers. Assuming the threshold value of the error equal to 5%, the applicability conditions of the two approximations have been individuated for several values of the power-law exponent, showing a crucial role of the rheology. The comparison with the clear-water results indicates that applicability criteria for clear-water flows do not apply to shear thinning fluids, potentially leading to an incorrect use of approximated models if the rheology is not properly accounted for.

AB Nineteen private wells were investigated in order to evaluate the groundwater quality and the issues associated with well water use in a fractured metasedimentary aquifer of the Canadian Shield, in western Quebec (Canada). Groundwater sampling and analysis reveal that the quality of well water is both a potential aesthetic and health concern for the residents. Aesthetic problems are mainly related to the high levels of hardness and dissolved iron and manganese. Potential health risks are associated with the occurrence of brackish groundwater, high manganese concentrations, and arsenic concentrations exceeding the Canadian guideline value of 10 mu g/I. Brackish groundwater is suspected to be derived from the mixing of fresh groundwaters with deep calcium-sodium-chloride brines of the Canadian Shield. The occurrences of iron, manganese and arsenic, primarily derived from the natural weathering of bedrock, are highly dependent on the geochemical conditions in groundwater, particularly the redox potential. Arsenic occurs mainly as arsenite (As(III)) and is thought to be released by the dissolution of iron and manganese oxyhydroxides under reducing conditions. Information obtained from well owners indicates that most households use ion exchange water softeners to minimize aesthetic problems of excessive hardness and dissolved iron and manganese concentrations. Homeowners generally take protective measures to reduce their exposure to arsenic when they are aware of the contamination. The exposure to arsenic and manganese may pose health risks for residents that do not take protective measures. The quality of well water is of paramount importance for human health in rural areas. Information on the contaminant sources and individual mitigation measures is essential to assess the health risks associated with groundwater consumption and to ensure the protection of public health.

AB The upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite mission, to be launched in 2021, will measure river water surface elevation, slope and width, with an unprecedented level of accuracy for a remote sensing tool. This work investigates the river discharge estimation from synthetic SWOT observations, in the presence of strong uncertainties in the model inputs, i.e. the river bathymetry and bed roughness. The estimation problem is solved by a novel variant of the standard variational data assimilation, the '4D-Var' method, involving the full Saint-Venant 1.5D-network hydraulic model SIC2. The assimilation scheme simultaneously estimates the discharge, bed elevation and bed roughness coefficient and is designed to assimilate both satellite and in situ measurements. The method is tested on a 50 km-long reach of the Garonne River during a five-month period of the year 2010, characterized by multiple flooding events. First, the impact of the sampling frequency on discharge estimation is investigated. Secondly, discharge as well as the spatially distributed bed elevation and bed roughness coefficient are determined simultaneously. Results demonstrate feasibility and efficiency of the chosen combination of the estimation method and of the hydraulic model. Assimilation of the SWOT data results into an accurate estimation of the discharge at observation times, and a local improvement in the bed level and bed roughness coefficient. However, the latter estimates are not generally usable for different independent experiments. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing urbanization augments impervious surface area, which results in increased run off volumes and peak flows. Green Infrastructure (GI) approaches are a decentralized alternative for sustainable urban stormwater and provide an array of ecosystem services and foster community building by enhancing neighborhood aesthetics, increasing property value, and providing shared green spaces. While projects involving sustainability concepts and environmental design are favored in privileged communities, marginalized communities have historically been located in areas that suffer from environmental degradation. Underprivileged communities typically do not receive as many social and environmental services as advantaged communities. This research explores GI-based management strategies that are evaluated at the watershed scale to improve hydrological performance by mitigating storm water run off volumes and peak flows. GI deployment strategies are developed to address environmental justice issues by prioritizing placement in communities that are underprivileged and locations with high outreach potential. A hydrologic/hydraulic stormwater model is developed using the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM 5.1) to simulate the impacts of alternative management strategies. Management scenarios include the implementation of rain water harvesting in private households, the decentralized implementation of bioretention cells in private households, the centralized implementation of bioretention cells in municipally owned vacant land, and combinations of those strategies. Realities of implementing Cl on private and public lands are taken into account to simulate various levels of coverage and routing for bioretention cell scenarios. The effects of these strategies are measured by the volumetric reduction of run off and reduction in peak flow; social benefits are not evaluated. This approach is applied in an underprivileged community within the Walnut Creek Watershed in Raleigh, North Carolina. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change is nowadays widely considered to have major effects on groundwater resources. Climatic projections suggest a global increase in evaporation and higher frequency of strong rainfall events especially in Mediterranean context. Since evaporation is synonym of low recharge conditions whereas strong rainfall events are more favourable to recharge in heterogeneous subsurface contexts, a lack of knowledge remains then on the real ongoing and future drinking groundwater supply availability at aquifers scale. Due to low recharge potential and high inter-annual climate variability, this issue is strategic for the Mediterranean hydrosystems. This is especially the case for coastal aquifers because they are exposed to seawater intrusion, sea-level rise and overpumping risks. In this context, recharge processes and rates were investigated in a Mediterranean coastal aquifer with subsurface heterogeneity located in Southern Corsica (France), Aquifer recharge rates from combining ten physical and chemical methods were computed. In addition, hydrochemical and isotopic investigations were carried out through a monthly two years monitoring combining major ions and stable isotopes of water in rain, runoff and groundwater. Diffuse, focused, lateral mountain system and irrigation recharge processes were identified and characterized. A predominant focused recharge conditioned by subsurface heterogeneity is evidenced in agreement with variable but highly favourable recharge rates. The fast water transfer from the surface to the aquifer implied by this recharge process suggests less evaporation, which means higher groundwater renewal and availability in such Mediterranean coastal aquifers.

AB Climate change will be particularly experienced though the medium of water. Water organisations, that are managing societal and ecological needs for water, are therefore likely to experience the impact the most. This study reviews the current literature regarding adaptation to climate change by water management organisations and associated barriers.
   Literature on adaptive capacity is growing and a general consensus is emerging on the determinants of adaptive capacity, although variations exist regarding how it is to be evaluated, enhanced and applied to policy making due to its dynamic, contextual and latent nature. Since adaptive capacity is hard to measure and successful adaptation difficult to define, some studies focus on the existence of adaptation attributes of organisations. Studies reporting successful adaptation are minimal and barriers of adaptation are being discovered as adaptation research transitions into implementation. But the root causes of these barriers are often overlooked and the interconnectedness of the barriers is poorly addressed.
   Increasingly, combining top-down and bottom-up approaches to adaptation is being recommended due to the limitations of each. However, knowledge regarding how organisations operating at different scales can enhance adaptive capacity of other organisations operating at another scale is lacking due to the few studies of inter-organisational networks across scales. Social networks among actors are recognised as a key factor to enable adaptation. However, network studies generally focus on individual actors and rarely between public agencies/organisations. Moreover, the current literature is inadequate to understand the relationship between adaptation enabling characteristics, barriers and adaptation manifestation. The review demonstrates that research on understanding the emergence and sustenance of barriers is urgently required. Addressing these knowledge gaps will help to improve the design of adaptation strategies, thereby improving the ability of water management to address the ongoing challenges of climate change.

AB Understanding the processes controlling nutrient delivery in headwater agricultural watersheds is essential for predicting and mitigating eutrophication and harmful algal blooms in receiving surface waters. The objective of this study was to elucidate nutrient transport pathways and examine key components driving nutrient delivery processes during storm events in four nested agricultural watersheds (298-19,341 ha) in the western Lake Erie basin with poorly drained soils and an extensive artificial drainage network typical of the Midwestern U.S. Concentration-discharge hysteresis patterns of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), and particulate phosphorus (PP) occurring during 47 storm events over a 6 year period (2004-2009) were evaluated. An assessment of the factors producing nutrient hysteresis was completed following a factor analysis on a suite of measured environmental variables representing the fluvial and wider watershed conditions prior to, and during the monitored storm events. Results showed the artificial drainage network (i.e., surface tile inlets and subsurface tile drains) in these watersheds was the primary flow pathway for nutrient delivery to streams, but nutrient behavior and export during storm events was regulated by the flow paths to and the intensity of the drainage network, the availability of nutrients, and the relative contributions of upland and in-stream nutrient sources. Potential sources and flow pathways for transport varied among NO3-N, PP, and DRP with results underscoring the challenge of mitigating nutrient loss in these watersheds. Conservation practices addressing both nutrient management and hydrologic connectivity will likely be required to decrease nutrient loss in artificially drained landscapes. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Check dams are one of the most common strategies for controlling sediment transport in erosion prone areas, along with soil and water conservation measures. However, existing mathematical models that simulate sediment production and delivery are often unable to simulate how the storage capacity of check dams varies with time. To explicitly account for this process-and to support the design of check dam systems-we developed a modelling framework consisting of two components, namely (1) the spatially distributed Soil Erosion and Sediment Delivery Model (WaTEM/SEDEM), and (2) a network-based model of check dam storage dynamics. The two models are run sequentially, with the second model receiving the initial sediment input to check dams from WaTEM/SEDEM. The framework is first applied to Shejiagou catchment, a 4.26 km(2) area located in the Loess Plateau, China, where we study the effect of the existing check dam system on sediment dynamics. Results show that the deployment of check dams altered significantly the sediment delivery ratio of the catchment. Furthermore, the network-based model reveals a large variability in the life expectancy of check dams and abrupt changes in their filling rates. The application of the framework to six alternative check dam deployment scenarios is then used to illustrate its usefulness for planning purposes, and to derive some insights on the effect of key decision variables, such as the number, size, and site location of check dams. Simulation results suggest that better performance-in terms of life expectancy and sediment delivery ratio-could have been achieved with an alternative deployment strategy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The rapid urbanization and industrialization in developing countries have increased pollution by heavy metals, which is a concern for human health and the environment. In this study, according to the data obtained from the monitoring stations in the Songhua River basin, the multivariate statistical analysis methods are applied to the hydrological data of the Songhua River basin in order to examine the relation between human activities and the spatio-temporal change of heavy metals (Pb and Cu) in water. By comparing the concentrations at different flow periods, the minimum Pb concentrations are found to have occurred most frequently in low flow periods while the maximum values mostly appeared in average flow periods. Moreover, the minimum Cu concentration in the water frequently occurred in high flow periods. The results show there are low Pb and Cu concentrations in upstream and downstream sections and high concentrations in mid-stream sections, and high concentrations are most frequently measured in the sections of Ashihe' downstream and estuary. Moreover, we have predicted the future (during 2018-2025) trend of the change for the heavy metals pollution in the rivers. The results demonstrated intense human activities are the most important factor causing jump features of typical heavy metal pollution in the different periods for different sections of this study area. The research would provide decision-making and planning for the Songhua River basin during the period of China's 13th Five-Year Plan. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) is considered as a key factor in hydrological and climatological studies, agricultural water management, irrigation scheduling, etc. It can be directly measured using lysimeters. Moreover, other methods such as empirical equations and artificial intelligence methods can be used to model ET. In the recent years, artificial intelligence methods have been widely utilized to estimate reference evapotranspiration (ETo). In the present study, local and external performances of multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and gene expression programming (GEP) were assessed for estimating daily ETo. For this aim, daily weather data of six stations with different climates in Iran, namely Urmia and Tabriz (semi-arid), Isfahan and Shiraz (arid), Yazd and Zahedan (hyper-arid) were employed during 2000-2014. Two types of input patterns consisting of weather data-based and lagged EL data-based scenarios were considered to develop the models. Four statistical indicators including root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R-2), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used to check the accuracy of models. The local performance of models revealed that the MARS and GEP approaches have the capability to estimate daily ETo using the meteorological parameters and the lagged ETo data as inputs. Nevertheless, the MARS had the best performance in the weather data-based scenarios. On the other hand, considerable differences were not observed in the models' accuracy for the lagged ET data-based scenarios. In the innovation of this study, novel hybrid models were proposed in the lagged ETo data-based scenarios through combination of MARS and GEP models with autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) time series model. It was concluded that the proposed novel models named MARS-ARCH and GEP-ARCH improved the performance of ETo modeling compared to the single MARS and GEP. In addition, the external analysis of the performance of models at stations with similar climatic conditions denoted the applicability of nearby station' data for estimation of the daily ETo at target station.

AB River channel drying caused by intermittent stream flow is a widely-recognized factor shaping stream ecosystems. There is a strong need to quantify the distribution of intermittent streams across catchments to inform management. However, observational gauge networks provide only point estimates of stream flow variation. Increasingly, this limitation is being overcome through the use of spatially contiguous estimates of the terrestrial water-balance, which can also assist in estimating runoff and streamfiow at large-spatial scales. Here we proposed an approach to quantifying spatial and temporal variation in monthly flow intermittency throughout river networks in eastern Australia. We aggregated gridded (5 x 5 km) monthly water-balance data with a hierarchically nested catchment dataset to simulate catchment runoff accumulation throughout river networks from 1900 to 2016. We also predicted zero flow duration for the entire river network by developing a robust predictive model relating measured zero flow duration (% months) to environmental predictor variables (based on 43 stream gauges). We then combined these datasets by using the predicted zero flow duration from the regression model to determine appropriate 'zero' flow thresholds for the modelled discharge data, which varied spatially across the catchments examined. Finally, based on modelled discharge data and identified actual zero flow thresholds, we derived summary metrics describing flow intermittency across the catchment (mean flow duration and coefficient-of-variation in flow permanence from 1900 to 2016). We also classified the relative degree of flow intermittency annually to characterise temporal variation in flow intermittency. Results showed that the degree of flow intermittency varied substantially across streams in eastern Australia, ranging from perennial streams flowing permanently (11-12 months) to strongly intermittent streams flowing 4 months or less of year. Results also showed that the temporal extent of flow intermittency varied dramatically inter-annually from 1900 to 2016, with the proportion of intermittent (weakly and strongly intermittent) streams ranging in length from 3% to nearly 100% of the river network, but there was no evidence of an increasing trend towards flow intermittency over this period. Our approach to generating spatially explicit and catchment-wide estimates of streamfiow intermittency can facilitate improved ecological understanding and management of intermittent streams in Australia and around the world.

AB Semi-analytical solutions are presented for flow to a well in an extensive homogeneous and anisotropic unconfined-fractured aquifer system separated by an aquitard. The pumping well is of infinitesimal radius and screened in either the overlying unconfined aquifer or the underlying fractured aquifer. An existing linearization method was used to determine the watertable drainage. The solution was obtained via Laplace and Hankel transforms, with results calculated by numerical inversion. The main findings are presented in the form of non-dimensional drawdown-time curves, as well as scaled sensitivity dimensionless time curves. The new solution permits determination of the influence of fractures, matrix blocks and watertable drainage parameters on the aquifer drawdown. The effect of the aquitard on the drawdown response of the overlying unconfined aquifer and the underlying fractured aquifer was also explored. The results permit estimation of the unconfined and fractured aquifer hydraulic parameters via type-curve matching or coupling of the solution with a parameter estimation code. The solution can also be used to determine aquifer hydraulic properties from an optimal pumping test set up and duration. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SHALLOW-WATER EQUATIONS; SCHEME
AB The traditional Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) scheme has been proven to be incapable of modelling trans-critical flows. Its inherent lack of shock-capturing capability often results in spurious oscillations and computational instabilities. However, the ADI scheme is still widely adopted in flood modelling software, and various special treatments have been designed to stabilise the computation. Modification of the Boussinesq coefficient to adjust the amount of fluid inertia is a numerical treatment that allows the ADI scheme to be applicable to rapid flows. This study comprehensively examines the impact of this numerical treatment over a range of flow conditions. A shock-capturing TVD-MacCormack model is used to provide reference results. For unsteady flows over a frictionless bed, such as idealised dam-break floods, the results suggest that an increase in the value of the Boussinesq coefficient reduces the amplitude of the spurious oscillations. The opposite is observed for steady rapid flows over a frictional bed. Finally, a two-dimensional urban flooding phenomenon is presented, involving unsteady flow over a frictional bed. The results show that increasing the value of the Boussinesq coefficient can significantly reduce the numerical oscillations and reduce the predicted area of inundation. In order to stabilise the ADI computations, the Boussinesq coefficient could be judiciously raised or lowered depending on whether the rapid flow is steady or unsteady and whether the bed is frictional or frictionless. An increase in the Boussinesq coefficient generally leads to overprediction of the propagating speed of the flood wave over a frictionless bed, but the opposite is true when bed friction is significant.

AB Past studies modeling stream-aquifer interaction commonly account for vertical anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity, but rarely address horizontal anisotropy, which may exist in certain sedimentary environments. If present, horizontal anisotropy will greatly impact stream depletion and the amount of recharge a pumped aquifer captures from the river. This scenario requires a different and somewhat more sophisticated mathematical approach to model and interpret pumping test results than previous models used to describe captured recharge from rivers. In this study, a new mathematical model is developed to describe the spatiotemporal distribution of drawdown from stream-bank pumping with a well screened across a horizontally anisotropic, confined aquifer, laterally bounded by a river. This new model is used to estimate four aquifer parameters including the magnitude and directions of major and minor principal transmissivities and storativity based on the observed drawdown-time curves within a minimum of three non-collinear observation wells. In order to approve the efficacy of the new model, a MATLAB script file is programmed to conduct a four-parameter inversion to estimate the four parameters of concern. By comparing the results of analytical and numerical inversions, the accuracy of estimated results from both inversions is acceptable, but the MATLAB program sometimes becomes problematic because of the difficulty of separating the local minima from the global minima. It appears that the new analytical model of this study is applicable and robust in estimating parameter values for a horizontally anisotropic aquifer laterally bounded by a stream. Besides that, the new model calculates stream depletion rate as a function of stream-bank pumping. Unique to horizontally anisotropic and homogeneous aquifers, the stream depletion rate at any given pumping rate depends closely on the horizontal anisotropy ratio and the direction of the principle transmissivities relative to the stream-bank.

AB Better understanding of the dynamics of hydrological connectivity between river and floodplain is essential for the ecological integrity of river systems. In this study, we proposed a regime-switch modelling (RSM) framework, which integrates change point analysis with dynamic linear regression, to detect and date change points in linear regression, and to quantify the relative importance of natural variations and anthropogenic disturbances. The approach was applied to the long-term hydrological time series to investigate the evolution of river-floodplain relation in Dongting Lake in the last five decades, during which the Yangtze River system experienced unprecedented anthropogenic manipulations. Our results suggested that 1) there were five distinct regimes during which the influence of inflows and local climate on lake water level changed significantly. The detected change points were well corresponding to the major events occurred upon the Yangtze; 2) although the importance of inflows from the Yangtze was greater than that of the tributaries flows over the five regimes, the relative contribution gradually decreased from regime 1 to regime 5. The weakening of hydrological forcing from the Yangtze was mainly attributed to the reduction in channel capacity resulting from sedimentation in the outfalls and water level dropping caused by river bed scour in the mainstream; 3) the effects of local climate was much smaller than these of inflows; and 4) since the operation of The Three Gorges Dam in 2006, the river-floodplain relationship entered a new equilibrium in that all investigated variables changed synchronously in terms of direction and magnitude. The results from this study reveal the mechanisms underlying the alternated inundation regime in Dongting Lake. The identified change points, some of which have not been previously reported, will allow a reappraisal of the current dam and reservoir operation strategies not only for flood/drought risk management but also for the maintenance and restoration of the regional ecological integrity.

AB Isotopic and chemical data on the mineral water, mud volcanoes fluid and associated gases from the biggest Russian island Sakhalin, together with previous stable isotope data (d(18)O, dD, C-13), allow elucidation of their origin and general evolution. The water fluid circulation is mainly related to marine environment inducing three distinct types: Na-HCO3-Cl alkali carbonate groundwaters, Na-Cl-HCO3 highly evolved saline and Na-Cl mature groundwaters, indicating different evolution. Chemical evolution of groundwater on Sakhalin Island demonstrated cation exchange and salinization as dominant evolutionary pathways. Isotopic composition of groundwaters varies from meteoric to metamorphic waters. These metamorphic waters consist of water hydration from the clay and seawater are traced in fluids of Yuzhno-Sakhalin mud volcano despite modification by mixing with meteoric waters and water-rock interaction processes. Fault systems that define the areas of highly mineralized water circulation appear to play a major role in the CO2 migration to the surface and CH4 generation. The delta C-13(CO2) values have pointed that gas phase in high-pCO(2) waters mostly consists of mantle-derived CO2. The carbon isotope signature of methane delta C-13(CH4) and delta D(CH4) indicates its distinct origin which is specified by tectonics. Methane manifestation in the south of the Sakhalin Island is mainly related to thermogenic reservoirs as they are more often dislocate by tectonics, and crossed by active and permeable faults. The sources of biogenous methane in the north of Sakhalin Island is related to younger and shallower reservoirs, and less affected by tectonic processes. The determinations of Rn-222 have allowed observing that maximal radon flux is associated with high pCO(2) waters. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is well established that seismic waves traveling through porous media stimulate fluid flow and accelerate particle transport. However, the mechanism remains poorly understood. To quantify the coupling effect of hydrodynamic force, transportation distance, and ultrasonic stimulation on particle transport and fate in porous media, laboratory experiments were conducted using custom-built ultrasonic controlled soil column equipment. Three column lengths (23 cm, 33 cm, and 43 cm) were selected to examine the influence of transportation distance. Transport experiments were performed with 0 W, 600 W, 1000 W, 1400 W, and 1800 W of applied ultrasound, and flow rates of 0.065 cm/s, 0.130 cm/s, and 0.195 cm/s, to establish the roles of ultrasonic stimulation and hydrodynamic force. The laboratory results suggest that whilst ultrasonic stimulation does inhibit suspended-particle deposition and accelerate deposited-particle release, both hydrodynamic force and transportation distance are the principal controlling factors. The median particle diameter for the peak concentration was approximately 50% of that retained in the soil column. Simulated particle-breakthrough curves using extended traditional filtration theory effectively described the experimental curves, particularly the curves that exhibited a higher tailing concentration.

AB Due to increasing population worldwide, there is an urgent need to manage these important but diminishing groundwater resources efficiently to ensure their continued availability. The major innovative design of this study is to provide a practical assessment process for groundwater discharge under a regional demand by characterizing the nature of leaky confined aquifers overlain on a Mesozoic granitic gneiss basement which involves the important groundwater system in the Kinmen region (Taiwan, ROC) and the assessment of adoptable groundwater discharge in aquifer is needed. The storage coefficient presents an order of one in a thousand and hydraulic conductivity is approximately at the order of 1-8 m/d and 0.4-0.9 m/d for aquifer and aquitard respectively. Groundwater discharge and admissible number of pumping well is suggested considering scheduled maximum groundwater volume and head decline change for eastern and western studied area respectively. The safety subjected to the conservative issue is then addressed by the use of scheduled maximum groundwater volume. It reveals that the safety can be ensured using the indicator as scheduled maximum groundwater volume with predefined scenarios. The result can be utilized practically for developing management strategy of groundwater resources due to the applicability and novel of method. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article

   Oscillatory pumping tests; Groundwater; Open pit
ID TESTS; AQUIFER
AB Pump storage hydroelectricity is an efficient way to temporarily store energy. This technique requires to store temporarily a large volume of water in an upper reservoir, and to release it through turbines to the lower reservoir, to produce electricity. Recently, the idea of using old flooded quarries as a lower reservoir has been evoked. However, these flooded quarries are generally connected to unconfined aquifers. Consequently, pumping or injecting large volumes of water, within short time intervals, will have an impact on the adjacent aquifers. Conversely, water exchanges between the quarry and the aquifer may also influence the water level fluctuations in the lower reservoir. Using numerical modelling, this study investigates the interactions between generic flooded open pit quarries and adjacent unconfined aquifers, during various pump-storage cyclic stresses. The propagation of sinusoidal stresses in the adjacent porous media and the amplitude of water level fluctuations in the quarry are studied. Homogeneous rock media and the presence of fractures in the vicinity of the quarry are considered. Results show that hydrological quarry - rock interactions must be considered with caution, when implementing pump - storage systems. For rock media characterized by high hydraulic conductivity and porosity values, water volumes exchanges during cycles may affect significantly the amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry, and as a consequence, the instantaneous electricity production. Regarding the impact of the pump - storage cyclic stresses on the surrounding environment, the distance of influence is potentially high under specific conditions, and is enhanced with the occurrence of rock heterogeneities, such as fractures. The impact around the quarry used as a lower reservoir thus appears as an important constraining factor regarding the feasibility of pump - storage systems, to be assessed carefully if groundwater level fluctuations around the quarry are expected to bring up adverse effects. Results highlight opportunities and challenges to be faced, to implement pump - storage hydroelectricity systems in old flooded open pit quarries. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new methodology based on the computational intelligence (CI) system is proposed and tested for modeling the classic 1D dam-break flow problem. The reason to seek for a new solution lies in the shortcomings of the existing analytical and numerical models. This includes the difficulty of using the exact solutions and the unwanted fluctuations, which arise in the numerical results. In this research, the application of the radial-basis-function (RBF) and multi-layer-perceptron (MLP) systems is detailed for the solution of twenty-nine dam-break scenarios. The models are developed using seven variables, i.e. the length of the channel, the depths of the up-and downstream sections, time, and distance as the inputs. Moreover, the depths and velocities of each computational node in the flow domain are considered as the model outputs. The models are validated against the analytical, and Lax-Wendroff and MacCormack FDM schemes. The findings indicate that the employed CI models are able to replicate the overall shape of the shock- and rarefaction-waves. Furthermore, the MLP system outperforms RBF and the tested numerical schemes. A new monolithic equation is proposed based on the best fitting model, which can be used as an efficient alternative to the existing piecewise analytic equations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In a karstic field, the flow paths are very complex as they globally follow the conduit network. The responses generated from an investigation in this type of aquifer can be spatially highly variable. Therefore, the aim of the investigation in this case is to define a degree of connectivity between points of the field, in order to understand these flow paths. Harmonic pumping tests represent a possible investigation method for characterizing the subsurface flow of groundwater. They have several advantages compared to a constant-rate pumping (more signal possibilities, ease of extracting the signal in the responses and possibility of closed loop investigation). We show in this work that interpreting the responses from a harmonic pumping test is very useful for delineating a degree of connectivity between measurement points. We have firstly studied the amplitude and phase offset of responses from a harmonic pumping test in a theoretical synthetic modeling case in order to define a qualitative interpretation method in the time and frequency domains. Three different type of responses have been separated: a conduit connectivity response, a matrix connectivity, and a dual connectivity (response of a point in the matrix, but close to a conduit). We have then applied this method to measured responses at a field research site. Our interpretation method permits a quick and easy reconstruction of the main flow paths, and the whole set of field responses appear to give a similar range of responses to those seen in the theoretical synthetic case.

An absorption peak reaching to 83.5% is achieved at 1.04 THz. The hybrid metamaterial absorber exhibits high absorption when the incident angle reaches to 45 degrees. Measured results indicate that the absorption amplitude and peak frequency of the hybrid metamaterial absorber is tunable in experiments. It is due to the insulator to-metal phase transition is achieved when the measured temperature reaches to 68 degrees C.

AB Monoclinic phase Gd-2(MoO4)(3):Yb3+/Er3+ phosphor is synthesized via a simple sol-gel method. The XRD result reveals that the phosphor possesses monoclinic structure with space group C2/c(15). Under the excitation of a 980 nm laser, its emission spectra shows remarkably intense green and negligible red emissions, which are all two-photon process. By investigating effect of temperature on green emission of the sample, the competition between the thermal agitation and non-radiative relaxation of H-2(11/2) level can be found, which is verified by the measurement of lifetime. In addition, the sensitivity of optical thermometry is studied based on the fluorescence intensity ratio technique through infrared excited green upconversion. The maximum sensitivity is found to be about 0.02574 K-1 at 510.2 K, suggesting that the phosphor can be used as an excellent material for optical temperature sensing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Thermal effects in terbium aluminum garnet (TAG) ceramics (thermal lens and thermally induced depolarization) doped with silicon and titanium were investigated in temperature range of 79-293K. Samples with low dopant concentrations shows decreasing of negative thermal effects with cooling to 79 K. However for most part of samples thermal depolarization starts increasing after initial decreasing with cooling. Apparently it is connected with defects in media.
   Best sample (0.4 at% of Si) as pure TAG shows monotonous decreasing of thermally induced depolarization and 3.5 times Verdet constant increasing with cooling to 79 K, that leads to 1.8-times advantage over common magnetooptical media - terbium gallium garnet. It allows to provide an isolation of 30 dB at a radiation power of more than 6 kW as estimated. However, the procedure for creating ceramics samples obviously needs improvement because of the large scatter in the quality of the samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports the photoluminescence properties of Eu3+ doped CdF2 single crystals. The pulled crystals were prepared by use of the Bridgman technique from a vacuum furnace in fluoride atmosphere. Absorption, excitation and emission spectra of the crystal doped with three Eu3+ concentrations (0.02%, 0.1% and 0.6% mol.) were recorded at room temperature. The emission spectra exhibit a strong yellow and red emissions in the spectral range 550-720 nm which are assigned to D-5(0) -> F-7(J) (J = 1, 2, 4) transitions and a weak infrared emission around 816 nm corresponding to D-5(0) -> F-7(6) transition. The magnetic dipole emission (D-5(0) -> F-7(1)) is the most intense for each Eu3+ concentration.
   The Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters Omega(2), Omega(4), Omega(6) for 4f-4f transitions of Eu3+ ions were computed from the emission spectra using the D-5(0) -> F-7(J) (J = 1, 2, 4, 6) transitions. Via these phenomenological intensity parameters, the spontaneous emission probabilities, branching ratios, radiative lifetimes, quantum efficiencies and emission cross-sections for the main Eu3+ emitting levels are evaluated.

AB GdAlO3:Er3+/Yb3+, Gd3Al3O12:Er3+/Yb3+ and Gd4Al2O9:Er3+/Yb3+ phosphors were prepared by co-precipitation. The effects for Gd2O3-Al2O3 composite oxides as the host materials with different crystal structures such as GdAlO3, Gd3Al3O12 and Gd4Al2O9 were investigated. It was found that the perovskite structured GdAlO3:Er3+/Yb3+ (GAP phosphor) could be obtained from the precursor when the calcination temperature was 1000 degrees C, while the garnet structured Gd3Al3O12:Er3+/Yb3+ (GAG phosphor) could be formed when the calcination temperature was 1300 degrees C, but the monoclinic-structured Gd4Al2O9:Er3+/Yb3+ (GAM phosphor) could be formed only when the calcination temperature was raised up to 1500 degrees C. The difference of the up-conversion photoluminescence (UCPL) spectra under 980 nm between the GAP, GAG and GAM phosphors was studied. The result showed that the UCPL intensity of the GAP phosphor was close to that of the GAM phosphor with much higher red-to-green intensity ratio than that of GAP phosphor. The UCPL intensity of GAG phosphor was the weakest among them. Finally, the factors which influenced on the UCPL of the GAP, GAG and GAM phosphors were discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB 2-(4-fluorobenzylidene) malononitrile (FBM), an organic third order nonlinear (TONLO) single crystal with the dimensions of 32 x 7 x 11 mm(3), has been successfully grown in acetone solution by slow evaporation technique at 35 degrees C. The crystal system (triclinic), space group (P-1) and crystalline purity of the titular crystal were measured by single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction, respectively. The molecular weight and the multiple functional groups of the FBM material were confirmed through the mass and FT-IR spectral analysis. UV-Vis-NIR spectral study enroles that the FBM crystal exhibits excellent transparency (83%) in the entire visible and near infra - red region with a wide bandgap 2.90 eV. The low dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) value of FBM crystal is appreciable for microelectronics industry applications. Thermal stability and melting point (130.09 degrees C) were ascertained by TGA-DSC analysis. The laser-induced surface damage threshold (LDT) value of FBM specimen is found to be 2.14 GW/cm(2), it is fairly good compared to other reported NLO crystals. The third - order nonlinear optical character of the FBM crystal was confirmed through the typical single beam Z-scan technique. All these finding authorized that the organic crystal of FBM is favorably suitable for NLO applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), the next-generation lighting sources are the potential replacements for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). In recent years, organic small molecules (SMs) have established the applicability in solid-state lighting, and considered as prospective active materials for LECs with higher device performance. Here, we describe the synthesis of pyrene-imidazole based SMs, PYR1, and PYR2 that differ by one pyrene unit and their characterization by various spectroscopic methods. To investigate the thermal, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of the two synthesized compounds, we performed thermogravimetric, UV-visible, photoluminescence (PL), and voltammetric measurements. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of PYR1 and PYR2 measured in the acetonitrile solution, where PYR1 and PYR2 emit in the blue spectral region with peaks aligned at 383 nm and 389 nm, respectively. The fabricated LEC devices exhibited broader electroluminescence (EL) spectra with a significant red shift of the emission maxima to 446 nm and 487 nm, with CIE coordinates of (0.17, 0.18) and (0.18, 0.25) for PYR1 and PYR2, respectively. The LEC5 based on PYR1 and PYR2 produced maximum brightness values of 180 and 72 cd m(-2) and current densities of 55 and 27 mA cm(-2), respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pr3+ doped Ba2CaWO6 phosphor were prepared by traditional high-temperature solid-state reaction technique. The structure evolution was systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. The X-ray powder diffraction patterns indicate that the prepared phosphors crystallized in the cubic double-perovskite structure. The functional groups were identified using FTIR spectra and the elements present in the composition were confirmed by the EDS profile. The morphology of the phosphor was identified using SEM and TEM analysis. The PL spectra illustrated that these phosphors could be efficiently excited by charge transfer band of host and the maximum luminescence intensity was observed at 0.06 wt% of Pr3+ ion. Upon the charge transfer band excitation, emission spectra showed peaks at 489, 532, 647, 685 and 737 nm corresponding to P-3(0) -> H-3(4), P-3(1) -> H-3(5), P-3(0) -> F-3(2), P-3(0) -> F-3(3) and P-3(0) -> F-3(4) transitions respectively. The concentration quenching of Ba2CaWO6:Pr3+ phosphor can be mainly attributed to dipole-dipole interaction. The CIE coordinates were estimated to be close to the white region. The decay curves are well fitted with double exponential decay models. The standard and modified Judd-Ofelt (JO) theories were used to determine the Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters, radiative transition probabilities and branching ratios. The optical properties indicate that Ba2CaWO6:Pr3+ phosphors can produce white light emission from a single phase host and its potential application for solid-state lighting and display devices.

AB Ho3+ doped zinc fluorophosphate (ZFP) glasses with molar chemical compositions, (60-x) NH4H2PO4+20ZnO+10BaF(2)+10NaF+xHo(2)O(3) (where x = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mol%) were prepared by melt quenching technique. These glasses were characterized through physical, structural, optical, excitation, luminescence and decay curve analysis. From the absorption spectra, spectral intensities (f(exp) and f(cal)), Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters (Omega(2), Omega(4) and Omega(6)), radiative transition probabilities (AT), radiative lifetimes (tau(R)) and branching ratios (beta(R)) were evaluated for all Ho3+ doped ZFP glass matrices. From the photoluminescence spectra, peak stimulated emission cross-sections (sigma(p)) were calculated for all Ho3+ doped ZFP glasses. The Ho3+ doped ZFP glasses show strong green emission at 545 nm and red emission at 656 nm under excitation, 450 nm. The measured lifetimes (tau(meas)) of (S-5(2))F-5(4) level of Ho3+ doped ZFP glasses were obtained from decay profiles. The CIE color coordinates of Ho3+ doped ZFP glasses were calculated from emission spectra and 1.0 mol% of Ho3+ doped ZFP glass matrix gives green emission. Hence, these results confirm that the Ho3+ doped ZFP glasses could be considered as a promising candidate for visible green laser applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Efficient warm yellowish-white fluorescence emissions of Dy3+ were observed in heavy metal germanium tellurite (HGT) glasses under the excitation of 454 nm. Further, the luminescence intensity of Dy3+ is increased by similar to 29% accompanying the introduction of Ag NPs with diameter similar to 7 nm when compared with that of the silver-free case, which is caused by the existence of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The larger net emission power, the more net emission photon number and the higher quantum yield in Dy2O3 doped HGT glasses containing Ag NPs (HGT-Ag) confirm the availability of utilizing laser. Presupposed fluorescence color trace reveals that white luminescence can be achieved when the intensity ratio between residual laser and Dy3+ emission reaches the appropriate range. The productive transition emissions and the tunable white fluorescence illustrate tellurite glasses embodying noble metal NPs are a potential candidate for high-quality lighting devices.

AB The spectroscopic properties of 0.6at.%:Pr:Ca1-xRxF2+x (R = Y, Gd; x = 0,0.006, 0.012, 0.03, 0.06) crystals were investigated and compared. The XRD tests were conducted and the cell dimensions of the crystals were calculated. Room temperature absorption spectra have been registered and analyzed, The emission spectra and decay curves of the crystals were obtained at room temperature. Increasing the proportion of the lattice regulators of Y3+ or Gd3+ ions could significantly enhance the luminescence intensity of all visible emission bands with different ratios. Particularly, the emission intensity ratio of orange to red increased from 0.15 to 1.9 in Pr:Ca1-xYxF2+x crystals and to 1.02 in Pr:Ca1-xGdxF2+x crystals, respectively. Furthermore, Pr:Ca1-xGdxF2+x crystals have substantially strong emission at orange and red region of 580 -660 nm, comparable with blue light at 482 nm. The quantum efficiency of the crystals increased rapidly with the increment of R3+ concentration, and finally tend to be 100%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Quantum dots (QDs) are well known for their optical properties which differ from those of bulk semiconductors. Herein, we have created an energy transfer platform that combines CdS QDs with a coumarin based dye C485 [7-(dimethyl amino)-4-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-2-one]. Spectroscopic studies of energy transfer between the dye donor and CdS QDs as acceptors reveal the occurrence of dynamic quenching. Analysis of the steady-state and time resolved fluorescence measurements of C485 in the presence of CdS QDs infers fluorescence resonance (Forster type) energy transfer (FRET) as responsible for the quenching phenomena. The energy transfer efficiency as well as energy transfer distance for the donor-acceptor pair is calculated using steady-state fluorescence method. Luminescence enhancement of CdS QDs play a critical role in device performance for solar applications and also in the field of biological applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, we prepared a Mn(II)-coordinated carbon dots (CDs) with fluorescence and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) bimodal properties by a one-pot solvothermal method and separated via silica column chromatography. The quantum yield of the CDs increased greatly from 2.27% to 6.75% with increase of Mn(II) doping, meanwhile the CDs exhibited a higher MR activity (7.28 mM(-1)s(-1)) than that of commercial Gd-DTPA (4.63 mM(-1)s(-1)). In addition, white light emitting CDs were obtained by mixing the different types of CDs. Notably, these CDs exhibited different fluorescence emissions in different organic solvents and could be used to discriminate organic solvents based on the polarity and protonation of the solvents.

AB Cadmium sulphide (CdS) and Mn-doped CdS nanocrystals were synthesized by co-precipitation method. The nanocrystals were characterized by Fluorescence, Fourier Transformed Infra-red Spectrometer (FTIR), UV Visible, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM), and High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM). A considerable blue shift of absorption band with respect to the cadmium sulphide was observed by the Mn concentration (0.5 M) in the doped sample with decreasing the size of nanocrystals. Other reason for this may be Mn doping. Subsequently the band gap was altered from 2.11 to 2.21 eV due to quantum confinement effect. Scanning electron microscope supplemented with EDAX was operated to find grain size and chemical composition of the synthesized nanomaterials. The PL spectrum of Mn-doped CdS nanocrystals displays three PL bands the first one, within the range of 500 nm and the second band at 537 nm, and the third one around 713 nm is labelled red band emission due to attributed to a T-4(1) -> (6)A(1) transition within the 3d shell of divalent manganese. XRD analysis showed that the material was in cubic crystalline state. A comparative study of surfaces of un-doped and metal doped CdS nanocrystals were investigated using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The synthesized nano material in combination with polymer, poly (3-hexyl thiophene) was operated in the construction of photovoltaic cells. The photovoltaic devices with CdS nanocrystals exhibited power conversion efficiency of 0.34% without annealing and 0.38% with annealing. However, the power conversion efficiency was enhanced by a factor of 0.35 without annealing and 0.42 with annealing with corporation of Mn impurity in CdS lattice. Atomic Force Microscopy was employed for morphology and packing behavior of blend of nanocrystals with organic polymer. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nd3+-doped glasses in the composition (50-x) B2O3-10 PbO-10 BaO-10 Al2O3-10 ZnO-10 Na2O-(x) Nd2O3 (x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mol %) were fabricated using melt quenching method. Upon 592 nm visible and 808 nm LD excitations, the luminescence spectra show a strong F-4(3/2) -> I-4(11/2) (1.06 m) emission transition, and two less intense F-4(3/2) -> I-4(9/2) (0.89 mu m) and F-4(3/2) -> I-4(13/2) (1.331 mu m) emission transitions. The intensity of such emissions increases up to 0.5 mol % Nd3+, and above this doping level, quenching occurs. For 0.5 mol % Nd3+-doped glass, following Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters and emission spectrum, A(R), tau(R), beta(R) and beta(exp), including Delta lambda(eff) sigma(em)(lambda(p)), (sigma(em) x (Delta lambda(eff))) and (sigma(em) x (tau(rad))), are derived for Nd3+ ion F-4(3/2) -> I-4(11/2) and F-4(3/2) -> I-4(13/2) fluorescence transitions. The highest sigma(em)(lambda(p)) for the 1.06 and 1.331 mu m fluorescence bands are found to be 6.216 x 10(-20) and 2.295 x 10(-20) cm(2), respectively. The F-4(3/2) level lifetimes are found to decrease with an increase in Nd2O3 content and the decay curves of the glass up to 1.5 mol % Nd3+ exhibit single exponential nature. From 'tau(exp)' of the Nd3+: F-4(3/2) level, quantum efficiency (eta), ((sigma(em) x (tau(exp))), and saturation intensity (I-S) are 48.87%, 51.09 x 10(-25) cm(2)s and 3.67 x 10(8) W/m(2), respectively, for the 0.5 mol % Nd3+-doped glass. Higher thermal stability, very low chi, high A(R), large beta(exp)., moderate tau(R), large gain bandwidth and high optical gain values indicate that 0.5 mol % Nd3+-doped glass could be a potential gain medium for solid-state NIR lasers at 1.06 mu m. Moreover, for the 1.331 pm emission, large Delta lambda(eff) and the theoretical gain coefficient value of 1.579 dB/cm, evaluated with an excited Nd3+ ion fractional factor of 0.6, indicate that this glass might be a promising candidate in developing O-band optical fiber amplifiers.

AB A novel red fluorescent push-pull system able to generate an intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) complex was synthesized. The novel dye (R-PDX) combines some structural features which are rarely encountered in the design of other push-pull systems: hexyl-substituted phenoxazine as donor moiety, divinylketone as pi-linker, and p-fluorobenzene as electron acceptor group. The relationship between the structural motif, photo-physical and electrochemical properties by UV-Vis absorption, photoluminescence and cyclic voltammetry was thoroughly investigated both as red dopant in poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) or polyimide (PI) matrix, and non-doped host emitter. The molecular rigid cores of the synthesized dye formed supramolecular rod-like structures in condensed phase with a strong impact on the emissive centers. The aggregation was totally suppressed when the dye was used as dopant in an amorphous polymeric matrix, such as PMMA or PI. Electrochemical measurements revealed the dye ability for both hole and electron injection and transport. The fluorescence emission was found to be highly sensitive to solvent polarity, rendering blue-green, yellow, orange and red light emission in different organic solvents. The absolute fluorescence quantum yield reached 39.57% in solution, and dropped to 1.2% in solid state and to 14.01% when the dye was used as dopant in PMMA matrix. According to the available CIE 1931 standard, R-PDX emitted pure and saturated red light of single wavelength with chromaticity coordinates very close to those of National Television System Committee (NTSC) standard red colour. The R-PDX photo-optical features were compared to those of the commercial red emitter 6, 13-diphenylpentacene. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The fluorescence and upconversion studies of Er3+ doped and Er3+/Nd3+ co-doped silicate based oxyfluoride glasses have been systematically analyzed. The broad band NIR emissions (830-1700 nm), includes optical bands like O, E, S, C and L were observed in the Er3+-Nd3+ co-doped glasses. The NIR emission intensity peaks centered at 876, 1057, 1329 and 1534 nm were observed for the Er3+-Nd3+ co doped glasses. In the co-doped samples the strongest emission intensity at 1534 nm increased up to 0.5 mol % and then decreased to 3.0 mol % of Nd3+ ions under the excitation of 980 nm. The upconversion studies of the co-doped samples were recorded under the excitation of 980 and 808 nm and found the upconversion emission peaks centered at 524, 530, 547, 590 and 656 nm. The energy transfer processes between the relevant excitation levels of Er3+ and Nd3+ ions and energy transfer efficiency were discussed. The obtained results indicate that Nd3+ can be an efficient sensitizer for Er3+ to enhance upconversion emission at green laser transition for sensors and NIR emission at 1534 nm for optical communication applications.

AB This paper deals with the electrical, optical and electrochemical properties of a metal-free dye C78H74O8 (AS-2), which has been used to improve the photo-detection properties of C58H86N8O8RuS2 (N719) based Dye sensitized photo-sensors (DSPSs). Both dyes were mixed together in various proportions and the most promising ratio N719/AS-2 (1:0.25) was selected for staining photo-anodes for DSPS integration. The fabricated DSPSs were studied in terms of electrical parameters and photodetection properties. The N719/AS-2 (1:0.25) based DSPS were found to have a reduced leakage current, increased breakdown voltage and a closer proximity to an ideal diode, as compared to the N719 based DSPS. Further, the N719/AS-2 (1:0.25) based DSPS was also found to have better linearity at high irradiance levels, thus rendering the co-sensitized device useful as a photosensor in various applications. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was also performed to explain the interfacial charge recombination process. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We have theoretically studied the electronic and optical properties of a GaAs/AIGaAs elliptic quantum ring under in-plane electric field. The effects of an eccentric internal barrier-placed along the electric field direction, chosen as x-axis- and incident light polarization are particularly taken into account. The one-electron energy spectrum and wave functions are found using the adiabatic approximation and the finite element method within the effective-mass model. We show that it is possible to repair the structural distortion by applying an appropriate in-plane electric field, and the compensation is almost complete for all electronic states under study. For both concentric and eccentric quantum ring the intraband optical properties are very sensitive to the electric field and probe laser polarization. As expected, in the systems with eccentricity distortions the energy spectrum, as well as the optical response, strongly depends on the direction of the externally applied electric field, an effect that can be used as a signature of ring eccentricity. We demonstrated the possibility of generating second harmonic response at double resonance condition for incident light polarized along the x-axis if the electric field or/and eccentric barrier break the inversion symmetry. Also, strong third harmonic signal can be generated at triple resonance condition for a specific interval of electric field values when using y-polarized light. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB alpha-LiAlSi2O6, known as mineral spodumene, is introduced as a novel SRS-active crystal with monoclinic symmetry C2/c. Under picosecond laser excitation Raman-induced steady-state chi((3))-nonlinear generation in the visible and near-IR is observed in the crystals. All recorded Stokes and anti-Stokes high-order lasing components are identified and correspond to three SRS-promoting phonon modes with omega(SRS1) approximate to 709 cm(-1), omega(RSR2) approximate to 357 cm(-1) and omega(SRS3) approximate to 1074 cm(-1). On the basis of the results of a spontaneous Raman scattering study they were assigned to vibrations of the tetrahedral [SiO4] groups of the silicate chains and lattice modes of Li-O or Al-O of the crystal structure. A brief review in tabular form of so far known SRS-active natural crystals (minerals) is given as well. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Optical properties of yttria-aluminoborate (YAB) glasses with general composition 10(Ce(x)TbyY((1-x-y)))-30Al(2)O(3)-60B(2)O(3) are investigated and compared with data available on YAB crystals with huntite-like structure. Ce doped samples show optical features ascribable to preferential location of rare earth ions in sites with specific geometry similar to that observed in crystalline structures. Samples prepared with Tb ions as emission activator and Ce ions as sensitizer have been studied within the framework of non radiative energy transfer. The resulting Forster radius is of 4.6 0.5 A comparable with that observed in Ce/Tb co -doped YAI(3)(BO3)(4) crystals. The investigated materials possess radio- and photoluminescence emission efficiencies and performances comparable to that of crystalline counterparts with the advantage of having easiness of preparation and workability typical of glassy systems.

AB The two-photon absorption (TPA) coefficient is obtained for pure lithium tantalate (LT) crystals as a function of C-Li = 100% x Li2O/(Li2O + Ta2O5) ratio. Five LT samples with C-Li = 47.95, 48.38, 48.75, 49.6 and 50 mol % were selected. The open Z-scan method was carried out to measure TPA coefficients at lambda = 400 nm using 90 fs pulses at the appropriate pulse intensity of I-0 = 3.5-4 GW/cm(2). The TPA coefficients in LT drastically increase with the Li content increase and they reach 3-4 cm/GW for the stoichiometric composition LiTaO3. TPA exhibits its saturation behavior with the saturation intensity of 11 GW/cm(2). (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This work investigates the impact of the conduction-band offset (CBO) and valence band offset (VBO) on the performance of Zn (O, S)/Cu2ZnSn (S, Se)(4) solar cells by numerical simulations. The band gap alignment at the buffer-CZTS layer interface are controlled by the sulfur-to-oxygen and sulfur-to-selenium ratios. The simulation results show that the high sulfur content in the Zn (O, S) layer makes a big offset in the conduction band and high oxygen content in the in the Zn (O, S) layer eventuates in large valence band offset, that descends Cu2ZnSn (S, Se)(4) solar cell performance. We established an initial device model based on an experimental device with world record efficiencies of 12.6%. This study shows that most suitable heterojunction for ZnO1-xSx/Cu2ZnSn (S-y, Se1-y)(4) solar cells is when sulfur content ranging 19%-50% in the Zn (O, S) and 30%-50% in the CZTSSe. The efficiency of Cu2ZnSn (S, Se)(4) solar cells will be achieved to 14.3%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The optical properties of the as-deposited Ge20Se80-xSx thin films have been studied by analysis the transmittance T(lambda) measured at room temperature in the wavelength range 200-2500 nm using Swanepoel's method. Urbach energy (E-e) and optical band gap (E-g) were strongly affected by sulfur concentration in the sample. The refractive index evaluated through envelope method was extrapolated by Cauchy dispersion relationship over the whole spectral range. Moreover, the dispersion of refractive index was analyzed in terms of the single-oscillator Wemple-Di Domenico model. The third-order nonlinear susceptibility (chi((3))) and nonlinear refractive index (n(2)) were calculated and discussed for different Ge20Se80-xSx (x = 0, 15 and 30%). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Polymer network liquid crystals (PNLCs) whose optical transmittance state switches between transparence at low temperatures and haze at high temperatures were fabricated from mixtures of nematic liquid crystals (LCs) and reactive mesogens (RMs). This PNLC structure is simple but effective, namely, consists of micro-scale domains of orientation-ordered LCs and anisotropically polymerized RMs. The domains form through photopolymerization induced phase separation with inhomogeneous irradiation projected by laser speckling techniques. This irradiation method enables you to control the size and shape of phase-separation domains, and these PNLCs can be applied to novel thermoresponsive optical devices; optical isolators, thermometric sheets, and smart windows.

AB In this study, tris (8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum/nano-titanium dioxide (Alq(3)/nano-TiO2) composites were synthesized using a simply in-situ process with 8-vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) as a modifier. The as-prepared Alq(3)/nano-TiO2 composites were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra. The effect of modification on luminescence properties for the samples was studied by photoluminescence (PL) spectra, electroluminescence (EL) spectra and time-resolved luminescence decay curves. Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) with the corresponded emitting layer structure were investigated. The results show that the amphiphilicity of the 8-vinyl POSS leads to well-dispersion state of the nano-TiO2 in the Alq(3). Adding a proper weight percentage of 8-vinyl POSS is beneficial for the PL and EL properties enhancement of the composites. OLED using the Alq(3)/nano-TiO2 with 1 wt% 8-vinyl POSS emitting layer has the low turn-on voltage (4.7 Vat 1 cd/m(2)), high maximum luminance (7463 cd/m(2) at 8.75 V), and high luminous efficiency (1.13 cd/A at 100 mA/cm(2)). Adding 1 wt% 8-vinyl POSS in Alq(3)/nano-TiO2 can increase the EL intensity by a factor of 37.1 at 8 V. These values are better than those for OLEDs using the Alga emitting layer. The increase in luminance and current efficiency stability can be attributed to the energy transfer process between the Alq(3) and the nano-TiO2, and the suppression of the self-quenching by caged 8-vinyl POSS molecules.

AB A facile hydrothermal method was used to synthesize ZnMoO4:Er3+,Yb3+ nanoparticles. The shapes and sizes of the nanoparticles were well tuned by simply monitoring the pH of the starting solution. Microballs consisting of agglomerated nanograins were observed at strong acidic condition. At mild pH, plates and rectangular particles were realized, while strong basic pH stabilized rods. Further increasing pH to extremely basic conditions (pH > 13), rods changed to fragile hairy structures. The nucleation and growth mechanism of nanograins to form different morphology nanoparticles were studied and illustrated. XRD patterns confirmed well crystalline, triclinic structure despite small amount of aliovalent metal ions doping. Under 980 nm excitation, the ZnMoO4:Er3+,Yb3+ nanophosphor exhibited strong green (centered at 530 and 560 nm) and weak red (centered at 660 nm) upconversion (UC) emissions. Substitution of part of the Zn2+ ions by monovalent alkali ions intensified the UC emission intensities drastically. The order of intensification was K+>Na+>Li+>Rb+>no alkali ion. When Zn2+ ions were substituted with 10 at% K+ ions, the green and red UC emissions intensities increased by more than 50 and 15 folds, respectively. Time dependent measurements confirmed efficient Yb to Er energy transfer in the ZnMoO4:Er3+,Yb3+,K+ nanophosphor. The optimized ZnMoO4:Er3+,Yb3+,K+ phosphor exhibited intense UC emissions with 0.31% quantum yield. The upconverted light is visible to naked eye while pumping by laser of less than 1 mW power and opens door for variety of novel applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work reports on a process of preparation of garnet phosphor powders and a technique for light yield evaluation of strongly light scattering samples. Powders of scintillation compounds could be used as individual materials or as samples for express tests of scintillation properties. However, estimation of their light yield (LY) is complicated by strong light scattering of this kind of materials. Ce3+-activated yttrium-aluminum and gallium-gadolinium-aluminum garnet phosphor powders, Y3Al5O12 (YAG:Ce) and Gd3Ga3Al2O12 (GGAG:Ce), were obtained using a modified coprecipitation technique. Ga tends to residue in mother liquor in ammonia media, but the modification allows to avoid the loss of components. We propose an approach for sample preparation and LY measurement setup with alpha particles excitation, allowing to decrease light scattering influence and to estimate a light yield of powder samples. This approach is used to evaluate the obtained powders. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Under 361 nm excitation we revealed the extinction of the intrinsic defect emission and the enhancement of Eu3+ ion emission when Au content in samples is increased, but under excitation wavelength of 394 nm we observed only the suppression of Eu3+ ion emission. The cause of the observed PL behavior is related to the interaction between surface plasmon induced by gold nanoparticles and luminescence centers in the samples. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB We experimentally study supercontinuum generation in mixed thallous halides: thallium bromoiodide (KRS-5) and thallium chlorobromide (KRS-6), as pumped with mid-infrared femtosecond pulses. Almost 2 octave-wide supercontinuum spectra spanning wavelengths from similar to 1.5 mu m to more than 5.5 mu m were produced by self-focusing of 60 fs pulses with central wavelengths of 3.1 mu m and 3.6 mu m in KRS-5 and KRS-6 samples of 6 mm thickness, in the single and multiple filamentation regimes. Our measurements revealed remarkably low energy thresholds (few hundreds of nanojoules) for supercontinuum generation in these materials due to very large values of nonlinear indexes of refraction (n(2) = 10.5 x 10(-15) cm(2)/W for KRS-5 and n(2) = 5.4 x 10(-15) cm(2)/W for KRS-6), which were experimentally evaluated from the nonlinear propagation dynamics. A combination of high nonlinearity and wide infrared transparency range make KRS-5 and KRS-6 very attractive bulk materials for SC generation in the mid-infrared spectral range.

Conventional methods for characterizing the dynamic response by monitoring the amplitude of the time-varying light intensity do not account for spatial variation in material properties. In such cases, a more revealing method involves monitoring two distinct frequency components in order to characterize the dynamic and static contributions to the optical retardation. We demonstrate that, while this method works well for a ZnSe photo-elastic modulator, it does not fully capture the response of a cadmium zinc telluride electro-optic modulator. Ultimately, we show that acquiring the full waveform of the optical response enables a model to be created that accounts for inhomogeneity in the material that results in an asymmetric response with respect to the polarity of the driving voltage. This technique is applicable to broadband and fixed-wavelength applications in a variety of spectral ranges. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The two-step approach to the Eu2+ doped BaI2 center dot nH(2)O powders synthesis in Ar atmosphere from precursors containing different concentration of Eu3+ ions is reported. According to X-ray diffraction analysis the powders mainly consist of BaI2 center dot 2H(2)O phase. Their morphological, structural and luminescent properties depend on the Eu-ions concentration. The luminescence spectra are composed of broad and strong emission band peaking at 420 nm, which was related to the Eu2+ 5d-4f transition. Its intensity reaches maximum in the 2 at. % Eu2+ doped sample. Detailed analysis of the measured electron paramagnetic resonance spectra in the samples with different doping level confirms them belong to the Eu2+ ions substituting for the regular Ba2+ site in the Bale lattice. A sample exposed to the 330 nm UV irradiation exhibited an increase of the Eu2+ spectral intensity occurred exclusively due to the Eu3+ to Eu2+ transformation. No other signals either prior to or after the irradiation which might be attributed to the ions resided in e.g., interstitial positions or in any secondary phases were observed. Possible mechanisms of the Eu3+ stabilization in the host lattice with only divalent cation sites during the synthesis without additional treatment in reducing atmosphere are discussed as well.

AB Some photopysical properties of a new oligomer obtained from the anodic oxidation of the 4,4'-dimethoxy-chalcone were investigated using different and complementary techniques. Firstly, TGA analysis and X-Ray diffraction experiments showed that the oligomer is thermally stable up to 500 K and partially organized at the solid state, respectively. Secondly, the optical properties of the oligomer were studied in solution and in the solid state. The optical band gap was estimated to be 3.17 eV in solution state and 2.70 eV in film state. What's more, the fluorescence decay is determined showing a considerably faster in the film state (0.183 ns) than in solution state (1.606 ns), due to the rapid non-radiative decay at inter chain trap sites.

AB Structural and optical properties of InxGa1-xN/GaN multi quantum disks (QDisks) grown on GaN nano rods by molecular beam epitaxy have been investigated by transmission electron microscopy and micro photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Two types of InGaN QDisks were grown: a pseudo-3D confined InGaN pillar-type QDisks embedded in GaN nanorods; and QDisks in flanged cone type GaN nanorods. The PL emission peak and excitation dependent PL behavior of the pillar-type Qdisks differ greatly from those of the flanged cone type QDisks. Time resolved PL was carried out to probe the differences in charge carrier dynamics. The results suggest that by constraining the formation of InGaN QDisks within the centre of the nanorod, carriers are restricted from migrating to the surface, decreasing the surface recombination at high carrier densities.

AB GaN based ultraviolet multiple quantum well structures grown on a c-plane sapphire substrate by metal organic chemical deposition showed a microstructure with a large amount of huge hexagonal hillocks. The polarity of the sample is confirmed by etching with sodium hydroxide solution. The luminous intensity distribution of a typical hexagonal hillock was investigated by the phototluminescent mapping and the luminous intensity at hillock top regions was found to be 15 times higher than that of the regions around hillocks. The reduction of dislocations, the decreasing of the quantum confirmed stack effect caused by semipolar plane and the inclination of the sidewalls of the hexagonal hillock were responsible for the enhancement of luminous intensity.

AB This study reported the fabrication of a large area of micro/nano structures with different morphologies and sizes by the deposition of ablated material and melting of material on silicon through a line-shaped femtosecond laser beam irradiation. The evolution of micro/nano structures on the silicon surface was demonstrated with the laser fluence of 0.64 J/cm(2). It was found that the melting of material was responsible for the formation of the micro-protrusions from laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSSs). Additionally, the deposition fell on the surface of the micro-protrusions in oblique incidence way, causing LIPSSs obscure and even invisible. As a consequence, those micro-protrusions gradually evolved into the micro-spikes with the ladder-like surface. Then, various laser fluences were applied to regulate the deposition and melting behaviors of silicon, to obtain the micro/nano structures with different morphologies and sizes. The formation mechanism of these micro/nano structures was analyzed. On this basis, the optical properties test showed that best anti-reflectivity was referred to the sample full of micro-spikes with the ladder-like surface, and the average reflectance has decreased from similar to 38.17% of the planar silicon to similar to 4.75% in the waveband between 300 and 1000 nm.

AB The fundamental wavelength of a Q-switched pulsed Nd:YAG laser was employed to produce Au and copper oxide nanoparticles via pulsed laser ablation method in water. Different volumetric ratio of nanoparticles were mixed and irradiated by the second harmonic pulses of the Nd:YAG laser to prepare Au/Copper oxide nanocomposite. The experimental investigation was dedicated to study the properties of Au/Copper oxide nanocomposite as a function of volumetric ratio of Au nanoparticles and copper oxide nanoparticles. Nanocomposites of Au and copper oxide were found almost spherical in shape. Adhesion of spherical nanostructure in Au/Copper oxide nanocomposites was decreased with increasing the concentration of Au nanoparticles. Crystalline phase of the Au/Copper oxide nanocomposites differs with the change in the volumetric ratio of Au and copper oxide nanoparticles. The intensity of surface plasmon resonance of Au nanoparticles was decreased after irradiation. Au/Copper oxide nano composites suspensions have emissions in the visible range. Results reveal that green laser irradiation of nanoparticle suspensions is an appropriate method to synthesize Au based nanocomposites with controlled composition and size. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The peculiarities of the Stokes part of supercontinuum (SC) generated by femtosecond light pulses at wavelength 800 nm in single crystals of Gd2SiO5 (GSO), Ca4GdO(BO3)(3) (GCOB), Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG), LiTaO3 (LTO) and LuVO4 (LVO) were investigated. Spectral bandwidth and intensity of SC were measured as a function of energy of incident 100 fs pulses employing a grating spectrograph coupled with an InGaAs detector and spatial characteristics of the beam inside crystal samples were monitored perpendicularly to the direction of propagation and recorded using an optical microscope coupled with a camera. It was found that spectral widths of the Stokes part of SC increase markedly with increasing energy of incident pulses for all crystals under study. For fixed focusing conditions the spectral widths of generated SC in GSO, GCOB and GGG wide band-gap crystals are relatively large with cut-off wavelengths close to 1500 nm. Bandwidths of SC generated in LVO and LTO crystals, characterized by band-gaps E-g inferior to three times incident photon energy, are markedly smaller with cut-off wavelengths of 1300 nm and 1150 nm, respectively, Increase of incident pulse energy affects SC spectra giving rise to plateau-like regions stretching to ca 1000 nm.

AB Sm3+ doped SrWO4 was synthesized by the high temperature solid-state reaction method to explore its possible application in optical thermometry. Under a 404 nm excitation, the fluorescence intensity ratios (FIRs) between the down conversion emissions of the Sm3+:(4)G(5/2) -> H-6(5/2) (564 nm) to the SM3+:(4)G(5/2) -> H-6(7/2) (600 nm) and Sm3+:(4)G(5/2) -> H-6(9/2) (647 nm), respectively, were measured as a function of temperature in the range of 300-573 K. A maximum temperature sensitivity of 0.016 K-1 at 300 K is achieved. The results indicate that the SrWO4:Sm3+ is a promising candidate for optical thermometry. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A serious of pyridine based Schiff bases (M1, M2, and M3) were synthesized via condensation reaction of 4-aminosalicyclic acid with 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde, 3-pyridine carboxyaldehyde and 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde, respectively. The transformation of Schiff bases into their poly(phenoxyimine) species (P1, P2, P3) was obtained using oxidative polycondensation (OP) by NaOCl as the oxidant in alkaline medium at 70 degrees C. The structures of the synthesized compounds were characterized by solubility test, FT-IR, UV-Vis and NMR techniques. Thermal data were obtained by TG-DTA and DSC techniques. Photoluminescence (PL) properties of the synthesized materials were examined in organic solvent. Fluorescence measurements were carried out in various concentrated solutions to determine the optimum concentrations and PL intensities. P3 could be used in light-emitting diodes due to its multi-color (white, blue, green and yellow) light-emitting property. The efficiency (eta) of a solar cell of P1, P2 and P3 were determined by single channel Potentiostat/Galvanostat with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The order of conductivities was found to be as P3>P2>P1 as a result of iodine doping. The best performing photovoltaic cell with I-sc (mA cm(-2)), V-oc (V), FF, and eta (%) as -0.642, 0.399, 0.461 and 0.118 was obtained for P3. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dark solitons, which have good stability, long transmission distance and strong anti-interference ability. By using a coprecipitation method, the high quality indium tin oxide (ITO) were prepared with an average diameter of 34.1 nm. We used a typical Z-scan scheme involving a balanced twin-detector measurement system to investigated nonlinear optical properties of the ITO nanoparticles. The saturation intensity and modulation depths are 13.21 MW/cm(2) and 0.48%, respectively. In an erbium-doped fiber (EDF) lasers, we using the ITO nanoparticles as saturable absorber (SA), and the formation of dark soliton is experimentally demonstrated. The generated dark solitons are centered at the wavelength of 1561.1 nm with a repetition rate of 22.06 MHz. Besides, the pulse width and pulse-to-pulse interval of the dark solitons is similar to 1.33ns and 45.11 ns, respectively. These results indicate that the ITO nanoparticles is a promising nanomaterial for ultrafast photonics. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The NaGdTiO4:Yb3+/Tm3+ phosphor has been effectively synthesized by the traditional solid-state reaction method and its down-conversion and up-conversion luminescence properties were systematically studied. The results indicate that the electric dipole-dipole interaction is the main mechanism for the luminescence quenching. The fact that the ratios of the up-conversion intensities, i.e., I-795nm/I-798nm, I-807nm/I-798nm, and I-812nm/I-798nm, increase linearly with temperature (100 K-300 K) provides us a simple and accurate temperature measurement method. Multi-ratios can be more accurate than using only one ratio, allowing for self-referenced temperature determination. It's promising for NaGdTiO4:Yb3+/Tm3+ to be used for optical temperature sensors.

AB Novel high luminescence fibers often exhibit potential applications in the fields of color displays and sensor systems. In this study, Eu(BA)(3)phen and Tb(BA)(3)phen powders was successfully synthesized by solvothermal reactions, firstly. Then, three kinds of novel flexible Eu(BA)(3)phen/PAN, Tb(BA)(3)phen/PAN and Eu/Tb(BA)(3)phen/PAN (BA = benzoic acid, phen = phenanthroline, PAN = Polyacrylonitrile) fibers had been successfully prepared by electrospinning technology. The characterizations of the final products have been investigated in detail. It was found that the diameter of the as-prepared fibers were almost uniform with the fabricated complexes doping into PAN successfully. Thermogravimetric analysis indicates that the thermal stability of the pure PAN fiber could be improved by the incorporation of the complex, although only 1 wt % was added. Furthermore, in Eu/Tb(BA)(3)phen complex, the fluorescence intensity of Eu3+ ions was remarkably increased by adding Tb3+ ions. This is primarily due to an energy transfer from the D-5(4) level of Tb (III) to the D-5(0) level of Eu (III) ions, where Tb3+ acted as sensitizer. The corresponding luminescent fibers displayed the same regularity as the complexes. Moreover, with the increasing of the incorporation of complexes into PAN, the fluorescence intensities were significantly enhanced and reached its maximum value at 2.5 wt % for Eu(BA)(3)phen/PAN fibers and 2.0 wt% for Tb(BA)(3)phen/PAN fibers. The further intensity decreased with the increasing content of the complexes because of typical emission concentration quenching. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, (Y3+-Cd3+] and [Mn2+-Ba2+] substitutions were designed in Ba3GdNa(PO4)(5)F:Eu2+ system, which were marked as BG(1-x)Y(x)NPF:Eu2+ and B(1-y)M(y)GNPF:Eu2+, respectively. It is found that their luminescence properties and thermal stability could be obviously tuned. For BG(1-x)Y(x)NPF:Eu2+ series, under 365 nm IN light, the emission spectra exhibited a continuous red-shift from 458 nm (x = 0) to 485 nm (x = 1) with the corresponding luminescence varying from blue light to cyan light. For B(1-y)M(y)GNPF:Eu2+ series, it was observed the coexistence of blue-green and enhanced red emission of Eu2+ and the appearance of Eu3+ emission when Mn2+ partly substituted Ba2+, resulting in a final white emission. In addition, the thermal stabilities of B(1-y)M(y)GNPF:Eu2+ were obviously improved with Mn2+ doping. The corresponding luminescence and thermal stability tuning mechanisms were investigated.

AB Zinc Lead Tungsten Tellurite (ZnPbWTe) glasses doped with different Pr3+ ion concentrations having the composition 5ZnO + 15PbO + 20WO(3) (60-x)TeO2 + xPr(6)O(11) (where x = 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 mol%) were prepared by using sudden quenching technique and characterized to understand their visible emission characteristic features using spectroscopic techniques such as absorption, excitation and emission. The Judd-ofelt (J-O) theory has been applied to the absorption spectral features with an aim to evaluate various radiative properties for the prominent fluorescent levels of Pr(3+)ions in the as-prepared glasses. The emission spectra recorded for the as-prepared glasses under 468 nm excitation show three prominent emission transitions P-3(0) -> H-3(6), P-3(0) -> F-3(2) and P-3(1) -> F-3(4), of which P-3(0) -> F-3(2) observed in visible red region (648 nm), is relatively more intense. The intensity of P-3(0) -> F-3(2) emission transition in the titled glasses increases up to 1mol% of Pr3+ ions and beyond concentration quenching is observed. Branching ratios (beta(R)) and emission cross-sections (sigma(se)) were estimated for P-3(0) -> F-3(2) transition to understand the luminescence efficiency in visible red region (648 nm). The CIE chromaticity coordinates were also evaluated in order to understand the suitability of these glasses for visible red luminescence devices. From the emission cross-sections, quantum efficiency and CIE coordinates, it was concluded that 1 mol% of Pr3+ ions in ZnPbWTe glasses are quite suitable for preparing visible reddish orange luminescent devices.

AB Herein, for the first time, we present a one-pot ingenious preparative method for fluorescent carbon dots from 2-propanol (2P-CDs) without external treatments. Structure, morphology, chemical composition and fluorescence properties of the 2P-CDs were examined. These results confirm that the as-synthesized 2P-CDs are amorphous, monodispersed, spherical and the average particle size is 2.5 +/- 0.7 nm. Most importantly, excitation-dependent emission properties were observed, which suggest that these 2P-CDs may be used in multicolor bioimaging applications. When incubated with HeLa cells, the 2P-CDs exhibit low cytotoxicity, and positive biocompatibility. Confocal microscopy image shows the uptake of 2P-CDs by HeLa cells and the application of probable biomarker is demonstrated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peacock tail feathers with subtle periodic nanostructures exhibit diverse striking brilliancy, which can be applied as natural templates to fabricate artificial photonic crystals (PhCs) via a biomineralization method. Alumina photonic-crystal structures are successfully synthesized via an immersion and two-step calcination process. The lattice constants of the artificial PhCs are greatly reduced compared to their natural matrices. The lattice constants are tunable by modifying the final annealing conditions in the biomineralization process. The reflection spectra of the alumina photonic-crystal structures are measured, which is related to their material and structural parameters. This work suggests a facile fabrication process to construct alumina PhCs with a high-temperature resistance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The spectroscopic properties of Tb3+ ions in monoclinic KLu(WO4)(2) double tungstate crystal are studied with polarized light. The absorption spectra in the visible, near- and mid-IR including the transitions to all lower-lying F-7(J) (J = 0 ... 5) excited states are measured. The maximum absorption cross-section for the F-7(6) -> D-5(4) transition is 3.42 x 10(-21) cm(2) at 486.7 nm for light polarization E vertical bar vertical bar N-m. The transition probabilities for Tb3+ ions are calculated within the Judd-Ofelt theory modified for the case of an intermediate configuration interaction (ICI). The radiative lifetime of the D-5(4) state is 450 mu s and the luminescence quantum yield is >90%. The polarized stimulated-emission cross-section spectra for all D-5(4) F-7(J) (J = 0 ... 6) emission channels are evaluated. The maximum sigma(SE) is 11.4 x 10(-21) cm(2) at 549.4 nm (for E vertical bar vertical bar N-m). Tb3+:KLu(WO4)(2) features high transition cross -sections for polarized light being promising for color tunable visible lasers and imaging. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The oxide MgGa2O4 spinel ceramics doped with Mn2+ ions was synthesized by a solid-state reaction at 1200 degrees C in air. The activator concentration was equal 0.05 mol% of MnO. Phase purity of the synthesized samples was analyzed by X-ray diffraction technique. This spinet ceramics show efficient green emission in the range from 470 to 550 nm with a maximum at about 505 nm under UV or X-ray excitations, which is due to Mn2+ ions. MgGa2O4: Mn2+ exhibits intense thermoluminescence (TL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) after influence of ionizing radiation. Are complex nature of the TL glow curves is associated with a significant number of structural defects that are responsible for the formation of shallow and deep electron traps. In this work, time-resolved OSL characteristics of the samples exposed to beta particles are reported for the first time. A light from green LED was used for optical stimulation. Obtained TL and OSL results suggest MgGa2O4:Mn2+ as perspective material for further research and possible application in radiation dosimetry. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Microstructured optical fibers (MOFs) allow a variety of advanced materials to be infiltrated in their air voids for obtaining the increased fiber functionality, and offering a new versatile platform for developing the compact sensors devices. We aim to investigate the thermal characteristics of high-index core triangular hybrid polymer/silica MOFs with circular air-voids infused with polymer by using the analytical field model [1]. We demonstrate that infiltration of air-voids with polymer, e.g., polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) can facilitate to tune the fundamental modal properties of MOF such as effective index of the mode, near and the far-field profiles, effective mode area and the numerical aperture over the temperature ranging from 0 degrees C to 100 degrees C, for different values of relative air-void ratios. The evolution of the mode shape for a given temperature has been investigated in transition from near field to far-field regime. We have studied the thermal dependence of splice losses between hybrid MOF and the standard step-index single-mode optical fiber in combination with Fresnel losses. For enhancing the evanescent field interactions, we have evaluated fraction of power associated with fundamental mode of hybrid MOF. We have compared the accuracy of our results with those based on full-vector finite-difference (FD) method, as available in the literature. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Optical properties of nucleobase thin films were studied by attenuated total reflection (ATR) and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Adenine and guanine films were deposited on fused silica and silver at room temperature by thermal evaporation, and the normal dispersion of refractive indices of transparent adenine and guanine films in the visible and near-infrared regions were analyzed. The measured ATR spectra of adenine (guanine) films and numerical simulations by optical transfer matrix formalism demonstrate that the shift of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) wavelength is approximately linearly proportional to the adenine (guanine) film thickness, indicating that SPR can be used for quantitative measurements of biomaterials. The Raman spectra indicated that the adenine (guanine) films can be deposited by thermal evaporation. The adenine (guanine) films on silver exhibited Raman intensity enhancement as compared to those on glass, which was attributed to the SPR effect of silver platform and might play a role as a hot plate for SERS detection of biomaterials.

AB Polystyrene microspheres (PSMs) with diameters of 5 pm and 10 gm are prepared on garnet by a self assembly method. The pressure generated by quartz sheet/PSM/garnet/graphite is measured by a resistance strain sensor as a function of the external direct current (DC) voltage. The surface morphology of the PSMs are observed by optical microscopy. The polarization properties of the linearly and circularly polarized laser beams with a wavelength of 1550 nm reflected from the different PSMs are researched by a Thorlabs PAX 5710 IR3 Polarization Analyzing System as a function of the external DC voltage. The results show that the PSMs with different sizes can be damaged when the external pressure exceeds its critical value of 3.0 MPa, but the critical DC voltages are different. The optical polarization properties of the circularly polarized laser beam can be changed with the external DC voltage, whereas the linearly polarized laser beam cannot be changed.

AB With the proliferation of heterogeneous health care data in the last three decades, biomedical ontologies and controlled biomedical terminologies play a more and more important role in knowledge representation and management, data integration, natural language processing, as well as decision support for health information systems and biomedical research. Biomedical ontologies and controlled terminologies are intended to assure interoperability. Nevertheless, the quality of biomedical ontologies has hindered their applicability and subsequent adoption in real-world applications. Ontology evaluation is an integral part of ontology development and maintenance. In the biomedicine domain, ontology evaluation is often conducted by third parties as a quality assurance (or auditing) effort that focuses on identifying modeling errors and inconsistencies. In this work, we first organized four categorical schemes of ontology evaluation methods in the existing literature to create an integrated taxonomy. Further, to understand the ontology evaluation practice in the biomedicine domain, we reviewed a sample of 200 ontologies from the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) BioPortal the largest repository for biomedical ontologies and observed that only 15 of these ontologies have documented evaluation in their corresponding inception papers. We then surveyed the recent quality assurance approaches for biomedical ontologies and their use. We also mapped these quality assurance approaches to the ontology evaluation criteria. It is our anticipation that ontology evaluation and quality assurance approaches will be more widely adopted in the development life cycle of biomedical ontologies.

AB A conceptual model abstractly defines a number of concepts and their relationships for the purposes of understanding and communication. Once a conceptual model is available, it can also be used as a starting point for the development of a software system. The development of conceptual models using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) facilitates the representation of modeled concepts and allows software developers to directly reuse these concepts in the design of a, software system. The OBO Foundry represents the most relevant collaborative effort towards the development of ontologies in the biomedical domain. The development of UML conceptual models in the biomedical domain may benefit from the use of domain-specific semantics and notation. Further, the development of these models may also benefit from the reuse of knowledge contained in OBO ontologies. This paper investigates the support for the development of conceptual models in the biomedical domain using UML as a conceptual modeling language and using the support provided by the OBO Foundry for the development of biomedical ontologies, namely entity kind and relationship types definitions provided by the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and the OBO Core Relations Ontology (OBO Core), respectively. Further, the paper investigates the support for the reuse of biomedical knowledge currently available in OBOFFF ontologies in the development these conceptual models. The paper describes a UML profile for the OBO Core Relations Ontology, which basically defines a number of stereotypes to represent BFO entity kinds and OBO Core relationship types definitions. The paper also presents a support toolset consisting of a graphical editor named OBO-RO Editor, which directly supports the development of UML models using the extensions defined by our profile, and a command line tool named OBO2UML, which directly converts an OBOFFF ontology into a UML model.

AB The emergence of network medicine has provided great insight into the identification of disease-related molecules, which could help with the development of personalized medicine. However, the state-of-the-art methods could neither simultaneously consider target information and the known miRNA-disease associations nor effectively explore novel gene-disease associations as a by-product during the process of inferring disease-related miRNAs. Computational methods incorporating multiple sources of information offer more opportunities to infer disease-related molecules, including miRNAs and genes in heterogeneous networks at a system level. In this study, we developed a novel algorithm, named inference of Disease-related MiRNAs based on Heterogeneous Manifold (DMHM), to accurately and efficiently identify miRNA-disease associations by integrating multi-omits data. Graph-based regularization was utilized to obtain a smooth function on the data manifold, which constitutes the main principle of DMHM. The novelty of this framework lies in the relatedness between diseases and miRNAs, which are measured via heterogeneous manifolds on heterogeneous networks integrating target information. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DMHM, we conducted comprehensive experiments based on HMDD datasets and compared DMHM with six state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results indicated that DMHM significantly outperformed the other six methods under fivefold cross validation and de novo prediction tests. Case studies have further confirmed the practical usefulness of DMHM.

ID CLASSIFICATION; LITERACY
AB Objectives: In addition to following the usual Heuristic Evaluation (HE) method, the usability of health information systems can also be evaluated using a checklist. The objective of this study is to compare the performance of these two methods in identifying usability problems of health information systems.
   Methods: Eight evaluators independently evaluated different parts of a Medical Records Information System using two methods of HE (usual and with a checklist). The two methods were compared in terms of the number of problems identified, problem type, and the severity of identified problems.
   Results: In all, 192 usability problems were identified by two methods in the Medical Records Information System. This was significantly higher than the number of usability problems identified by the checklist and usual method (148 and 92, respectively) (p < 0.0001). After removing the duplicates, the difference between the number of unique usability problems identified by the checklist method (n = 100) and usual method (n = 44) was significant (p < 0.0001). Differences between the mean severity of the real usability problems (1.83) and those identified by only one of the methods (usual = 2.05, checklist = 1.74) were significant (p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: This study revealed the potential of the two HE methods for identifying usability problems of health information systems. The results demonstrated that the checklist method had significantly better performance in terms of the number of identified usability problems; however, the performance of the usual method for identifying problems of higher severity was significantly better. Although the checklist method can be more efficient for less experienced evaluators, wherever usability is critical, the checklist should be used with caution in usability evaluations.

AB Objectives: Users attitude toward a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) and their interaction with this system are among the most important factors that influence its acceptance. This study aimed to augment the user's interaction with the user's perspective to select a usable PACS among three systems available on the market.
   Methods: We augmented the think aloud (TA) usability evaluation method with the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) to compare user interaction problems of three PACS user interfaces. Four radiologists and four internist physicians participated in this study. Usability characteristics including efficiency, effectiveness, leamability, error, and satisfaction were used to assess the usability of each PACS.
   Results: There was a significant difference in efficiency (p = 0.01), effectiveness (p = 0.005), learnability (p = 0.001), and satisfaction (p = 0.009). However, no significant difference in the number of errors (p = 0.18), mouse clicks and keystrokes (p = 0.12), and the number of usability problems (p = 0.6) were observed among the three PACS systems studied.
   Conclusions: This study showed that applying the proposed approach to augment TA with the user's perspective addresses almost all of the theoretical aspects of usability and can be employed to select the most usable PACS.

AB Introduction: Clinical data warehouses are often oriented toward integration and exploration of coded data. However narrative reports are of crucial importance for translational research. This paper describes Dr. Warehouse (R), an open source data warehouse oriented toward clinical narrative reports and designed to support clinicians' day-to-day use.
   Method: Dr. Warehouse relies on an original database model to focus on documents in addition to facts. Besides classical querying functionalities, the system provides an advanced search engine and Graphical User Interfaces adapted to the exploration of text. Dr. Warehouse is dedicated to translational research with cohort recruitment capabilities, high throughput phenotyping and patient centric views (including similarity metrics among patients). These features leverage Natural Language Processing based on the extraction of UMIS (R) concepts, as well as negation and family history detection.
   Results: A survey conducted after 6 months of use at the Necker Children's Hospital shows a high rate of satisfaction among the users (96.6%). During this period, 122 users performed 2837 queries, accessed 4,267 patients' records and included 36,632 patients in 131 cohorts.

DE Automated ICD coding; Clinical text mining; Deep learning; Natural
   language processing; Artificial intelligence in medicine
AB We address the assignment of ICD-10 codes for causes of death by analyzing free-text descriptions in death certificates, together with the associated autopsy reports and clinical bulletins, from the Portuguese Ministry of Health. We leverage a deep neural network that combines word embeddings, recurrent units, and neural attention, for the generation of intermediate representations of the textual contents. The neural network also explores the hierarchical nature of the input data, by building representations from the sequences of words within individual fields, which are then combined according to the sequences of fields that compose the inputs. Moreover, we explore innovative mechanisms for initializing the weights of the final nodes of the network, leveraging co-occurrences between classes together with the hierarchical structure of ICD-10. Experimental results attest to the contribution of the different neural network components. Our best model achieves accuracy scores over 89%, 81%, and 76%, respectively for ICD-10 chapters, blocks, and full-codes. Through examples, we also show that our method can produce interpretable results, useful for public health surveillance.

AB Background: We implemented a text message-based Short Message Service computer-assisted self-interviewing (SMS-CASI) system to aid adherence and monitor behavior in MTN-017, a phase 2 safety and acceptability study of rectally-applied reduced-glycerin 1% tenofovir gel compared to oral emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets. We sought to implement SMS-based daily reminders and product use reporting, in four countries and five languages, and centralize data management/automated-backup.
   Methods: We assessed features of five SMS programs against study criteria. After identifying the optimal program, we systematically implemented it in South Africa, Thailand, Peru, and the United States. The system consisted of four windows-based computers, a GSM dongle and sim card to send SMS. The SMS-CASI was, designed for 160 character SMS. Reminders and reporting sessions were initiated by date/time triggered messages. System, questions, responses, and instructions were triggered by predetermined key words.
   Results: There were 142,177 total messages: sent 86,349 (60.73%), received 55,573 (39.09%), failed 255 (0.18%). 6153 (4.33%) of the message were errors generated from either our SMS-CASI system or by participants. Implementation challenges included: high message costs; poor data access; slow data cleaning and analysis; difficulty reporting information to sites; a need for better participant privacy and data security; and mitigating variability in system performance across sites. We mitigated message costs and poor data access by federating the SMS-CASI system, and used secure email protocols to centralize data backup. We developed programming syntaxes to facilitate daily data cleaning and analysis, and a calendar template for reporting SMS behavior. Lastly, we ambiguated text message language to increase privacy, and standardized hardware and software across sites, minimizing operational variability.
   Conclusion: We identified factors that aid international implementation and operation of SMS-CASI for real-time adherence monitoring. The challenges and solutions we present can aid other researchers to develop and manage an international multilingual SMS-based adherence reminder and CASI system.

AB Objective: Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS) is a devastating form of acute kidney injury (MU) in advanced liver disease patients with high morbidity and mortality, but phenotyping algorithms have not yet been developed using large electronic health record (EHR) databases. We evaluated and compared multiple phenotyping methods to achieve an accurate algorithm for HRS identification.
   Materials and methods: A national retrospective cohort of patients with cirrhosis and AKI admitted to 124 Veterans Affairs hospitals was assembled from electronic health record data collected from 2005 to 2013. AKI was defined by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Five hundred and four hospitalizations were selected for manual chart review and served as the gold standard. Electronic Health Record based predictors were identified using structured and free text clinical data, subjected through NLP from the clinical Text Analysis Knowledge Extraction System. We explored several dimension reduction techniques for the NLP data, including newer high-throughput phenotyping and word embedding methods, and ascertained their effectiveness in identifying the phenotype without structured predictor variables. With the combined structured and NLP variables, we analyzed five phenotyping algorithms: penalized logistic regression, naive Bayes, support vector machines, random forest, and gradient boosting. Calibration and discrimination metrics were calculated using 100 bootstrap iterations. In the final model, we report odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.
   Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the different models ranged from 0.73 to 0.93; with penalized logistic regression having the best discriminatory performance. Calibration for logistic regression was modest, but gradient boosting and support vector machines were superior. NLP identified 6985 variables; a priori variable selection performed similarly to dimensionality reduction using high-throughput phenotyping and semantic similarity informed clustering (AUC of 0.81-0.82).
   Conclusion: This study demonstrated improved phenotyping of a challenging MU etiology, HRS, over ICD-9 coding. We also compared performance among multiple approaches to EHR-derived phenotyping, and found similar results between methods. Lastly, we showed that automated NLP dimension reduction is viable for acute illness.

AB Scheduling approaches for conventional surgery operating rooms in a hospital treat surgeons as bottleneck resources directly, but do not deal with stochastic medical resources, leading to an uneven human resource distribution in optimizing medical resource scheduling. Thus, this research focuses on the dynamic configuration scheduling problem for stochastic medical resources. In this paper, the surgical operating room is limited, and the arriving calls (i.e., number of patients) are dynamic. When a patient arrives, the nurse anesthetist and anesthesiologist are limited, but the medical service duration per patient is random. We introduce the drum buffer-rope (DBR) scheduling approach to analyze which types of medical resources become bottleneck resources for optimizing operating room scheduling. After verifying the effectiveness of the DBR method in uncertain situations, the Monte Carlo simulation is demonstrated.

AB One of the basic challenges in developing structural methods for systematic audition on the quality of biomedical ontologies is the computational cost usually involved in exhaustive sub-graph analysis. We introduce ANT-LCA, a new algorithm for computing all non-trivial lowest common ancestors (LCA) of each pair of concepts in the hierarchical order induced by an ontology. The computation of LCA is a fundamental step for non-lattice approach for ontology quality assurance. Distinct from existing approaches, ANT-LCA only computes LCAs for non-trivial pairs, those having at least one common ancestor. To skip all trivial pairs that may be of no practical interest, ANT-LCA employs a simple but innovative algorithmic strategy combining topological order and dynamic programming to keep track of non-trivial pairs. We provide correctness proofs and demonstrate a substantial reduction in computational time for two largest biomedical ontologies: SNOMED CT and Gene Ontology (GO). ANT-LCA achieved an average computation time of 30 and 3 sec per version for SNOMED CT and GO, respectively, about 2 orders of magnitude faster than the best known approaches. Our algorithm overcomes a fundamental computational barrier in sub-graph based structural analysis of large ontological systems. It enables the implementation of a new breed of structural auditing methods that not only identifies potential problematic areas, but also automatically suggests changes to fix the issues. Such structural auditing methods can lead to more effective tools supporting ontology quality assurance work.

AB Introduction: Food poisoning due to wild wasp broods ingestion has long been noted in the upstream region of the Lancang river valley, Yunnan province, China. This study describes the epidemiological and clinical features of the poisoning and possible causes.
   Methods: Surveillance data collected between 2008 and 2016 were analyzed to produce demographic data on patients, information on clinical presentations, wasp species identification, and estimations of possible risk factors for symptomatic cases.
   Results: Eleven poisoning events were associated with the ingestion of wild wasp broods, including 46 exposed persons with 31 symptomatic living cases and 8 deceased cases that were reported in the Yunnan province between 2008 and 2016. Poisoning cases were only detected in the upstream region of the Lancang river valley in the autumn. The severity of the symptoms was correlated with an evident dose-effect relationship regarding the quantity ingested. The mean latent period from wild wasp broods ingestion to the onset of the symptoms was 10 h for symptomatic living cases and 7 h for deceased cases, respectively. Both gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms were commonly observed in the poisoning cases.
   Conclusion: The toxin source may be indirectly caused by the wasp broods due to the prevalence of local poisonous plants, such as Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, Tripteiygium hypoglaucum Hutch and Vaccinium bracteatum Thunb. Educational programs at the start of wasp harvest season in September in the high-risk area should be carried out to reduce the incidence of poisonings. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In a previous study, we purified Sm-PLGV an heterodimeric phospholipase A(2), from the venom glands of the Tunisian scorpion Scorpio maurus. This enzyme contains a Long chain, a penta-peptide insertion, which is cut out during the maturation process, followed by a short chain. A disulfide bridge links the two chains. Three recombinant forms of this enzyme were produced in Escherichia coli: rPLA(2)(+5) with a penta-peptide insert, rPLA(2)(-5) without the penta-peptide, and the Long chain alone without the short one. In the present study, we showed that Sm-PLGV, rPLA(2)(+5) and rPLA(2)(-5) displayed more potent anti-angiogenic activity in vitro than the recombinant Long chain and the short one obtained by chemical synthesis. These phospholipases A(2) inhibited in a dose-dependent manner adhesion, migration and invasion of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells. Using Matrigel (TM), we demonstrated that Sm-PLGV, LrPLA(2)(+5) and rPLA(2)(-5) significantly inhibited tubulogensesis. We also showed a clear dissociation between the anti-angiogenic effect of Sm-PLGV and its catalytic activity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Snake envenoming represents a major burden for public health worldwide. In the Amazon, the official number of cases and deaths detected is probably underestimated because of the difficulty riverine and indigenous populations have reaching health centers in order to receive medical assistance. Thus, integrated analysis of health information systems must be used in order to improve adequate health policies. The aim of this work is to describe a series of deaths and identify risk factors for lethality from snakebites in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. All deaths from snakebites reported to the Brazilian Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (SINAN) and to the Mortality Information System (SIM; ICD10-10th revision, X.29), from 2007 to 2015, were included. Variables were assessed by blocks with distal (ecological variables), intermediate (demographics) and proximal (clinical variables) components to identify predictors of case fatality. A total of 127 deaths from snakebites were recorded, with 58 pairs found through linkage of the SINAN and SIM databases (45.7%), 37 (29.1%) deaths found only in SINAN and 32 (25.2%) found only in the SIM. Deaths occurred mostly in males (95 cases; 74.8%) living in rural areas (78.6%). The most affected age group was the >= 61 years old (36 cases; 28.4%). Snakebites were presumably due to Bothrops snakes in 68.5% of the cases and Lachesis in 29.5% based on clinico-epidemiological diagnosis. A proportion of 26.2% of the cases received treatment over 24 h after the bite ocurred. On admission, cases were mostly classified as severe (65.6%). Overall, 28 patients (22.0%). Deceased without any medical assistance Antivenom was given to 53.5%. In the multivariate analysis, a distance from Manaus >300 km [OR = 3.40 (95%Cl = 1.99-5.79); (p < 0.001)1; age >= 61 years [OR = 431 (95%Cl = 1.22-1521); (p = 0.023)] and Indigenous status [OR = 5.47 (95%Cl = 237-12.66); (p < 0.001)1 were independently associated with case fatality from snakebites. Severe snakebites [OR = 16.24 (95%Cl = 4.37-6039); (p < 0.001)] and a lack of antivenom administration [OR = 4.21 (95%Cl = 1.30-13.19); (p = 0.014)] were also independently associated with case fatality. Respiratory failureklyspnea, systemic bleeding, sepsis and shock were recorded only among fatal cases. In conclusion, i) death from snakebites was under-reported in the mortality surveillance system; ii) older age groups living in remote municipalities and indigenous peoples were the population groups most prone to death; iii) lack or underdosage of anti venom resulted in higher case fatality and iv) systemic bleeding, circulatory shock, sepsis and acute respiratory failure were strongly associated to fatal outcome.

AB Aspergillus flavus is a common fungal pathogen of plants, animals and humans. Recently, many genes of A. flavus have been reported involving in regulation of pathogenesis in crops, but whether these genes are involved in animal virulence is still unknown. Here, we used a previous easy-to-use infection model for A. flavus based on mouse model by intravenous inoculation of A. flavus conidia. The outcome of infections in mice model showed that A. flavus NRRL3357 and laboratory strain CA14 FTS were both in dose dependent manner and highly reproducible. The progress of disease could be monitored by mice survival and histology analysis. Fungal burden analysis indicated it was gradually decreased within 7 days after infection. Moreover, aspergillosis caused by A. flavus significantly up-regulated gene expression levels of immune response mediators, including INF-gamma, TNF-alpha, Dectin-1 and TLR2. Furthermore, the defined deletion A. flavus strains that previously displayed virulence in crop infection were also determined in this mouse model, and the results showed comparable degrees of infection in mice. Our results suggested that intravenous inoculation of conidia could be a suitable model for testing different A. flavus mutants in animal virulence. We hope to use this model to determine distinct A. flavus strains virulence in animals and study novel therapeutic methods to help control fungus diseases in the future. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The action of Cr-LAAO, an L-amino acid oxidase isolated from Calloselasma rhodosthoma snake venom, on NADPH oxidase activation in isolated human neutrophil function was investigated. This enzyme has an intrinsic activity of hydrogen peroxide production. Cr-LAAO, in its native form, induces the ROS production in neutrophil and migration of cytosolic NADPH oxidase components p40(Phox). p47(Phox) and p67(Phox) to the membrane, and Rac, a GTPase protein member, with the involvement of intracellular signaling mediated by phospho PKC-alpha. In its inactive form, iCr-LAAO does not induce NADPH oxidase activation in neutrophil showing that the intrinsic enzymatic activity does not have a role in this process, suggesting that its primary structure is essential for the cell's stimulation. Accordingly, the data showed for the first time that the Cr-LAAO has a role in NADPH oxidase complex activation triggering relevant proinflammatory events in human neutrophils. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Gossypol interferes with reproduction, causing damage to sperm, disrupting the estrous cycle and resulting in embryonic lethality. In females, gossypol administration promotes degeneration of ovarian follicles, but it is unknown whether this effect is direct or indirect. Thus, the aim of this study is to determine whether gossypol interferes with folliculogenesis in vitro in rats, mice and goats. Ovaries from rats and mice and fragments of goat ovaries were grown in cell culture for 24 h or 7 days. Four groups were tested: 0 (control), 5, 10 and 20 mu g gossypol/ml. After incubation, the ovaries were fixed and processed for histological analysis. Follicles were classified according to their stage of development as either viable or atretic. It was found that the ovaries of rats, mice and goats cultured with gossypol showed an increase in the proportion of atretic follicles and a consequent reduction in the proportion of viable follicles at all stages of follicular development. Compared to the control group, the viability of all ovarian follicles in the rat, mouse and goat groups was reduced after cultivation for 24 h by 56.9%, 56.5% and 68.0%, respectively, with the highest concentration of gossypol (20 mu g/mL), and after seven days, the respective reductions were 65.4%, 65.3% and 88.2%. Thus, it is possible that gossypol may directly affect follicular maturation, and consequently female fertility. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

LA English
DT Article
DE Imaging; Bronchiolitis; Quality improvement
ID GUIDELINE; INFANTS; IMPLEMENTATION; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS
AB Introduction: Bronchiolitis is one of the most common infectious diseases in children and the most frequent cause of hospitalization in infants. Clinical practice guidelines recommend that a chest X-ray (CXR) should not be routinely obtained in the diagnosis of bronchiolitis, as studies have shown that they do not affect clinical outcomes, but rather lead to overuse of pharmacological agents and a longer length of hospital stay.
   Objective: To determine whether active institution of bronchiolitis practice guidelines as part of a quality improvement project decreased the use of CXRs in the Pediatric Emergency Department (ED). Secondary outcomes included a decrease in the use of unnecessary medical interventions and a shorter mean hospital length of stay.
   Methods: The study was conducted at two Hadassah Medical Center Pediatric EDs. Guidelines were reviewed with the ED staff during departmental seminars by a senior pediatric pulmonologist, and posted at the physician computer stations in the ED. Prospective, post-intervention, data obtained during the study period was compared to retrospective, pre-intervention, data from the year prior to implementation of the intervention.
   Results: Post-intervention, 37% of patients vs. 58% in the retrospective cohort had a CXR via ED referral (p < 0.001). The use of hypertonic saline and bronchodilators decreased, while there was no significant change in antibiotic or corticosteroid use. There was a decrease in hospitalizations post-intervention (70% vs. 77%, p=0.05).
   Conclusion: This key intervention was successful in reinforcing the AAP guidelines, promoting greater cost-effectiveness, reducing radiation exposure, and saving valuable time and resources for the ED staff and the hospital.

AB Background: The burden of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) among adults in Europe is poorly defined.
   Methods: Structured searches of PubMed were conducted to identify the incidence of pneumococcal CAP among adults across Europe.
   Results: The overall incidence rates for CAP was 68-7000 per 100,000 and the incidence in hospitalised CAP cases of all causes was 16-3581 per 100,000. In general the incidence of CAP increased consistently with age. Available data indicated higher burdens of pneumococcal CAP caused in groups with more comorbidities. Most cases of pneumococcal CAP (30%-78%) were caused by serotypes covered by PCV13 vaccine; the incidence of PCV13-related pneumonia decreased after the introduction of childhood vaccination.
   Conclusions: We observed a high burden adult pneumococcal CAP in Europe despite use of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, particularly in elderly patients with comorbidities. CAP surveillance presented wide variations across Europe. Pneumococcal CAP has to be monitored very carefully due to the possible effect of current vaccination strategies.

   Methods: The study population was a subset of the COPD cohort COSYCONET. Echocardiographic parameters included the left atrial diameter (LA), early (E) and late (A) transmitral flow, mitral annulus velocity (e'), E wave deceleration time (E[dt]), and isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT). We quantified the effect of various predictors including forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and intrathoracic gas volume (ITGV) on the echocardiographic parameters by multiple linear regression and integrated the relationships into a path analysis model.
   Results: A total of 615 COPD patients were included (mean FEV1 52.6% predicted). In addition to influences of age, BMI and blood pressure, ITGV was positively related to e'-septal and negatively to LA, FEV1 positively to E(dt) (p < 0.05 each). The effect of predictors was most pronounced for LA, e'-septal and E(dt), and less for E/A, IVRT and E/e'. Path analysis was used to take into account the additional relationships between the echocardiographic parameters themselves, demonstrating that their associations with the predictors were maintained and robust.
   Conclusions: Airway obstruction and lung hyperinflation were significantly associated with cardiac diastolic filling in patients with COPD, suggesting a decreased preload rather than an inherently impaired myocardial relaxation itself. This suggests that a reduction in obstruction and hyperinflation could help to improve cardiac filling.

AB Background: Information is lacking about the severity of complications in children with influenza admitted to paediatric intensive care units (PICU) in the UK. In this study, we report risk factors for mortality, invasive ventilation and use of vasoactive drugs for children admitted to PICU with influenza.
   Methods: We evaluated all admissions to PICUs in England for resident children with a recorded influenza diagnosis between September 2003 and March 2015. We used the Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICANet) database linked to hospital admission records to identify influenza cases, and high-risk comorbidities among admitted children. We used mixed effects logistic regression models to determine risk factors for mortality, use of invasive ventilation and vasoactive drugs.
   Results: We identified 1961 influenza-related PICU admissions in 1778 children. Children with high-risk conditions accounted for 1540 admissions (78.5%). The odds of mortality were significantly higher for girls than boys (adjusted odds ratio 1.91; 95% confidence interval 1.31, 2.79), children from Asian/ Asian British (2.70; 1.74, 4.20) or other minority ethnic groups (3.95; 1.65, 9.42) compared to white British children, and significantly increased before and during the A(H1N1)pdm 2009 pandemic compared to the post-pandemic period. Children required invasive ventilation in 1588 admissions (81.0%), and received vasoactive drugs in 586 admissions (29.9%).
   Conclusions: Nearly four fifths of influenza-related PICU admissions occurred in children with high-risk conditions, highlighting the burden of severe influenza in this vulnerable population Further research is required to explain sex and ethnic group differences in PICU mortality among children admitted with influenza.

DT Article

   Paternal age

   TRENDS
AB Background: Advanced paternal age has been associated with offspring morbidity and mortality, possibly due to de novo mutations and epigenetic changes in male germ cells. Epigenetic changes in the cord blood cells have been linked to asthma symptoms in offspring, but the role of paternal age has been less studied.
   Methods: From the Danish National Birth Cohort, 48,785 children who completed the 7-year follow-up were included. Parental reports of physician-diagnosed asthma had been obtained by a posted or web-based questionnaire. Paternal age at delivery was obtained through linkage with maternal civil registration number in the Danish Civil Registration System and classified into four groups: <= 24, 25-34 (reference), 35-39, and > 40 years. We calculated the prevalence proportion of asthma and prevalence ratios (PRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using log-binomial regression, adjusting for paternal smoking, paternal asthma, and paternal socioeconomic status.
   Results: At the 7-year follow-up, 5875 children (12%) had physician-diagnosed asthma. The prevalence of asthma in 7-year old children was higher with paternal age of <= 24 (adjusted PR 1.40; 95% CI: 1.26; 1.55) and lower with the paternal age of >= 35 years (adjusted PR 0.84; 95% CI: 0.78; 0.89) compared to the reference group.
   Conclusions: Paternal age of >= 35 years was associated with a lower prevalence of asthma in childhood, and paternal age of <= 24 years with higher prevalence compared with paternal age of 25-34 years. The potential causes of higher asthma prevalence among offspring of young fathers warrant further investigation.

AB Introduction: Non-cystic fibrosis(CF) bronchiectasis has been recognized in children for the past 200 years. Early childhood pneumonia and underlying conditions such as immunodeficiency, primary ciliary dyskinesia(PCD), and congenital lung pathology should be considered in the etiology. The aim of our study was to describe the clinical characteristics, laboratory, and radiological findings of a large population of patients with non-CF bronchiectasis at a tertiary center.
   Methods: We analyzed the clinical findings of 187 patients diagnosed with non-CF bronchiectasis over a period of 10 years (January 2005-December 2015) at the Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine Department of Pediatric Pulmonology.
   Results: The median age at the time of diagnosis of non-CF bronchiectasis was 8 years (1-18 years). Consanguinity was positive in 59.4% (n = 111) of patients and 19.8% (n = 37) of patients had a positive family history for non-CF bronchiectasis. Common causes were PCD in 51.3% (n = 96), immunodeficiency in 15% (n = 28), history of tuberculosis in 5.9% (n = 11), post-infectious complication in 3.2% (n = 6) and other anomalies in 2.1% (n = 4) of patients. The frequency of pulmonary lobe involvement was as follows: 71.1% left-lower lobe, 59.4% right lower lobe, 54% right-middle lobe, 26.8% left lingula, 13.9% right upper lobe, and 9.6% left upper lobe.
   Conclusions: Diagnosis of non-CF bronchiectasis is often delayed because of a failure to recognize the significance of symptoms. Through clinical investigation, including a HRCT scan of the chest, sweat test, studies of immune function, and ciliary function in a child with a prolonged suppurative cough, remains important. In Turkey, the most common causes of non-CF bronchiectasis are PCD and immunodeficiency, related to a high frequency of consanguinity.

   CIRCUMFERENCE; FUNCTION TESTS; RISK; ASSOCIATION
AB Background: In prior work involving older persons, the reported associations of spirometric impairments with cardiovascular outcomes may have been confounded by age-related changes in lung function. Hence, using more age-appropriate spirometric criteria from the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI), we have evaluated the associations of spirometric impairments, specifically restrictive-pattern and airflow-obstruction, with cardiovascular death (CV-death) and hospitalization (CV-hospitalization). In these analyses, we also evaluated the competing outcome of noncardiovascular death (nonCV-death) and calculated measures of relative and absolute risk.
   Methods: Our study sample was drawn from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), including 4232 community-dwelling white persons aged >= 65 years. Multivariable regression models included the following baseline predictors: GLI-defined restrictive-pattern and airflow-obstruction, age, male gender, obesity, waist circumference, current smoker status, >= 10 pack-years of smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Outcomes included adjudicated CV-death, CV-hospitalization, and nonCV-death, ascertained over 10 years of follow-up. Measures of association included hazard ratios (HRs), rate ratios (RRs), and average attributable fraction (AAF), each with 95% confidence intervals.
   Results: Restrictive-pattern and airflow-obstruction were associated with CV-death (adjusted HRs: 1.57 [1.18, 2.09] and 1.29 [1.04, 1.60]) and with nonCV-death (adjusted HRs: 2.10 [1.63, 2.69] and 1.79 [1.51, 2.12]), respectively. Airflow-obstruction, but not restrictive-pattern, was also associated with CV-hospitalization (adjusted RRs: 1.18 [1.02, 1.36] and 1.20 [0.96, 1.50], respectively). The adjusted AAFs of restrictive-pattern and airflow-obstruction were 1.68% (0.46, 3.06) and 2.35% (0.22, 4.72) for CV-death, and 3.44% (1.97, 5.08) and 7.77% (5.15, 10.60) for nonCV-death, respectively.
   Conclusion: Assessment of GLI-defined spirometric impairments contributes to broad geriatric risk stratifications for both cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular outcomes.

AB Background: There are limited population based data on the prevalence of asthma in China. The China Asthma and Risk factors Epidemiologic (CARE) survey was designed to understand the prevalence and risk factors for asthma in mainland China.
   Objectives: The CARE survey aims to demonstrate the prevalence and risk factors of asthma in mainland China among adolescents (age > 14 years) and adults.
   Methods: The survey was performed between February 2010 and August 2012 in eight provinces/cities of seven areas in mainland China. The inhabitants (age, > 14 years) recruited in this survey were through multi-stage cluster random sampling. Asthma diagnosis was based on medical history and lung function tests. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyzed the risk factors for asthma.
   Results: The study included 164 215 subjects (men, 79 692 [48.53%]; women, 84 523 [51.47%]). 2034 (1.24%) were asthmatic patients. Among all asthmatic patients, 521 (25.61%) were newly diagnosed. Univariable regression analysis showed that risk factors for asthma included smoking, first-degree relatives with asthma, allergic rhinitis, chronic bronchitis, COPD, pollinosis, allergic pneumonia, concomitant allergic diseases, BMI and raising pets. Multivariable logistic regression indicated that asthma risk factors included women, age stratification, smoking, first-degree relatives suffering from asthma or pollinosis, combined with allergic rhinitis, eczema or GERD.
   Conclusions: We speculated that the prevalence of asthma is increasing in mainland China among individuals aged > 14 years in the past 10 years. A number of risk factors were identified. The risk factors of asthma would be further elucidated in our future work. Clinical implications: Our CARE study highlights that asthma epidemic in mainland China should be paid more attention.

TI Interstitial lung abnormality is prevalent and associated with worse
   outcome in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement

LA English
DT Article
ID IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY-FIBROSIS; INCIDENTAL FINDINGS; CIGARETTE-SMOKING;
   DISEASE; EMPHYSEMA; STENOSIS; IMPLANTATION; PIRFENIDONE; DIAGNOSIS; CT
AB Background: Interstitial lung abnormality (ILA) is found in 5-10% of the general population and is associated with increased mortality risk. Risk factors for ILA, including advanced age and smoking history also increase the risk for aortic stenosis (AS). Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become an increasingly utilized intervention for patients with severe AS, and requires a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest to assess aortic valve dimensions.
   Objectives: To determine the prevalence and clinical significance of ILA on HRCT performed in patients referred for TAVR.
   Methods: Consecutive pre-TAVR HRCTs performed over a 5-year period were reviewed. ILA was defined as bilateral, nondependent reticular opacities. All-cause mortality among TAVR recipients was compared between ILA cases and non-ILA controls matched 2:1 by age and gender using Cox proportional hazards regression and the Kaplan Meier estimator.
   Results: Of 623 HRCTs screened, ILA was detected in 92 (14.7%), including 62 patients that underwent TAVR. Among ILA cases, 17 (27.4%) had a typical or probable usual interstitial pneumonia pattern, suggesting a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Survival was worse in ILA cases compared to non-ILA controls (p=0.008) and ILA was an independent predictor of mortality after multivariable adjustment (HR 3.29, 95% CI 1.34-8.08; p=0.009).
   Conclusions: ILA is a common finding among patients with severe AS and is associated with increased mortality in those undergoing TAVR. Further research is needed to elucidate the biology underpinning this observation and determine whether ILA evaluation and risk stratification modulates this mortality risk.

AB Background: Prescribed inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) doses in asthma have been studied in cross-sectional settings whereas long-term follow-up studies have not been carried out.
   Objective: To evaluate prescribed medication longitudinally by calculating cumulative ICS doses and dose changes in a cohort of new-onset adult asthma during 12 years and in different groups of asthma control.
   Methods: A total of 203 patients were followed for 12 years as part of Seinajoki Adult Asthma Study (SAAS). All asthma-related visits and prescribed medication over the study period were collected from medical records.
   Results: Total cumulative ICS dose for the 12-year follow-up period was 3.4g (+/- SEM 0.1) per patient. Both respiratory specialists and GPs prescribed step-ups and step-downs in ICS treatment and in total 649 dose changes were noted during the follow-up (median 3(1-5) per patient). Patients with uncontrolled asthma received higher ICS doses throughout the follow-up period, and therefore, cumulative 12-year ICS dose (3.8g +/- SEM 0.2) in this group was higher than that in those with partially controlled (3.4g +/- SEM 0.2) or controlled disease (2.9g +/- SEM 0.2) (p= 0.0001). Patients with uncontrolled asthma were also prescribed a higher number of ICS dose changes than patients with controlled disease.
   Conclusion: Despite frequent dose changes and high ICS doses during the 12-year follow-up, the level of asthma control remained poor in patients with uncontrolled asthma. This suggests that high ICS doses may not be effective enough for management of disease in patients with uncontrolled adult-onset asthma and novel targeted treatments are required.

   PREDICTORS; HOSPITALIZATION; HYPERTENSION
AB Background and objective: Life expectancy data of COPD patients in comparison to the general population are primarily based upon long-term population cohort studies. These studies are limited by a poor definition of clinically significant COPD. The key element in the course of COPD is a clinical exacerbation. Therefore, this study investigated 15-year survival following hospitalization for an exacerbation of COPD in comparison to the general population.
   Methods: A number of 4229 subjects was studied, including 845 hospitalized COPD patients and 3384 age and sex matched controls. Mortality risks were assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and hazard rate ratios for death were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models, for each Gold Class separately.
   Results: Overall 15-year survival was 7.3% in the COPD group and 40.6% in the general population. Survival was 24%, 11.1%, 5.3% and 0% for COPD GOLD I-IV. The mean life expectancy following hospitalization was 9.7, 7.1, 6.1 and 3.4 years for stage GOLD I-IV and 10.2 years for the general population. Overall, negative prognostic factors were age, male gender, low FEV1, low TLCO, respiratory insufficiency, Charlson comorbidity class, ICU-admission and exacerbation frequency. Factors differed among GOLD stages.
   Conclusions: The 15-year survival for hospitalized COPD patients is reduced by 82% in comparison to the general population. This indicates a more deleterious course of clinically significant COPD in comparison to population cohorts. As such, every possible effort should be taken to reduce exacerbations in a personalized way.

AB Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disorder. The involvement of the respiratory system is frequent and culminates in dyspnea and exercise intolerance. Functional capacity is an important diagnostic tool, because it reflects the cardiorespiratory status, quality of life and prognosis. This systematic review aims to assess the reproducibility and validity of the six minute walk test (6MWT) to reflect the functional capacity of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis, and also the correlation between 6MWT and lung function. Searches for articles were performed in eight databases using MeSH/DeCS keywords. A total of 695 articles were found and, after verifying all eligibility criteria, six articles were included for analysis and scoring regarding the methodological quality according to the QUADAS scale (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies). All articles had good methodology (QUADAS between 9 and 11 points). The 6MWT is not correlated with lung function. There is a strong indication that the 6MWT is a reproducible test to assess the functional capacity of children and adolescents with CF. The validity assessment could not be reached because the studies included in this systematic review did not use adequate statistical tools to carry out such an evaluation.

AB Bacterial pathogens are the most frequent cause of pneumonia after transplantation. Early after transplantation, recipients are at higher risk for nosocomial infections. The most commonly encountered pathogens during this period are gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa.), but gram-positive coccus such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic bacteria can also be found. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be guided by previous colonisation of the recipient and bacterial resistance pattern in the hospital. Six months after transplantation, pneumonias are mostly due to community-acquired bacteria (S. pneumonia, H. influenza, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and others). Opportunistic pathogens take advantage of the state of immunosuppression which is usually highest from one to six months after transplantation. During this period, but also occurring many years later in the setting of a chronically depressed immune system, bacterial pathogens with low intrinsic virulence can cause pneumonia. The diagnosis of pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens can be challenging. The delay in diagnosis preventing the early instauration of adequate treatment in kidney transplant recipients with a depressed immune system, frequently coupled with co-morbid conditions and a state of frailty, will affect prognosis and outcome, increasing morbidity and mortality.
   This review will focus on the most common opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients: Legionella, Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis/nontuberculous, and Rhodococcus. Recognition of their specificities in the setting of immunosuppression will allow early diagnosis, crucial for initiation of effective therapy and successful outcome. Interactions with immunosuppressive therapy should be considered as well as reducing immunosuppression if necessary.

AB Objective: Although high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is useful for the characterization of minute morphological changes in the lungs, no study has investigated risk factors for lung involvement detected by HRCT in patients with Sjogren's syndrome with or without respiratory symptoms. The aim of the current study was to investigate risk factors for lung involvement in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome detected by HRCT, with a particular focus on airway and interstitial lung diseases.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome and investigated risk factors for lung involvement detected by HRCT. A total of 101 patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome with initial HRCT examinations were enrolled.
   Results: Higher age, dry mouth, and higher labial gland biopsy focus scores (>= 4) were risk factors for airway diseases (odds ratio [OR] 1.064 confidence interval [CI] 1.026-1.102, OR 8.795 CI 2.317-33.378 and OR 3.261 CI 1.100-9.675, respectively) in the multivariable analysis. Higher age, male sex, and higher labial gland biopsy focus scores (>= 4) were risk factors for interstitial lung diseases (OR 1.078 CI 1.032-1.127, OR 12.178 CI 1.121-132.307 and OR 3.954 CI 1.423-10.987, respectively) in the multivariable analysis. The presence of anti-T-lymphotropic virus type 1 antibodies was significantly more common in patients with airway diseases.
   Conclusions: This study showed significant associations of labial gland biopsy focus scores and dry mouth with pulmonary manifestations in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome. Focus scores as well as dry mouth may reflect lymphoproliferative activity in the lungs in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome.

AB Background: Despite pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) being an evidence-based treatment recommended for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), referral to PR seems to be low. Collating the evidence on referral rates and perceived barriers and enablers may help provide knowledge needed to increase referral.
   Objectives: The purpose of this scoping review was to determine 1) the rate of referral of patients with COPD to PR by healthcare professionals (HCPs) and 2) the barriers and enablers to referral perceived by HCPs.
   Methods: The JBI scoping review manual was used. Ovid Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses were searched from inception until July 28, 2017. 245 non-duplicate articles were screened. Included articles reported referral rates and/or HCP perceived barriers and/or enablers to PR referral.
   Results: Forty-two studies were included. Twenty-eight observational studies reported referral rates ranging from 0% to 85%. Seven studies looking at the effects of different interventions to improve COPD care reported a range of 2%-56% referral pre-intervention, and 8%-71% post-intervention. Nine studies reported HCP perceived barriers to referral. The two most common barriers were low knowledge of what PR is and its benefits and low knowledge of the referral process. Six studies reported HCP perceived enablers to referral. The most common enabler was training/experience in PR.
   Conclusion: The rate of referral to PR is suboptimal, but there are commonly reported barriers and enablers that may help with the creation of actionable changes. HCPs need more knowledge of PR and the benefits it provides.

TI The contribution of thoracic vertebral deformity and arthropathy to
   trunk pain in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

   OSTEOPOROSIS; MORTALITY; FRACTURE; PEOPLE; CANCER
AB Background: Pain, commonly localized to the trunk in individuals with COPD, may be due to osteoporosis-related vertebral deformity and chest wall hyper-expansion causing misalignment of joints between the ribs and vertebrae. The purpose of this study was to determine if thoracic vertebral deformity and arthropathy were independent contributors to trunk pain in COPD patients compared to people with a significant smoking history.
   Method: Participants completed the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) on the same day as chest CT scans and spirometry. Current and ex-smokers were separated into COPD (n=91) or non-COPD (n=80) groups based on spirometry. Subsequently, CT images were assessed for thoracic vertebral deformity, bone attenuation values, and arthropathy of thoracic vertebral joints.
   Results: The trunk area was the most common pain location in both COPD and non-COPD groups. Thoracic vertebral deformity and costotransverse joint arthropathy were independent contributors to trunk pain in COPD patients (adjusted OR=3.55 and 1.30, respectively) whereas alcohol consumption contributed to trunk pain in the non-COPD group (adjusted OR=0.35 in occasional alcohol drinkers; 0.08 in non-alcohol drinkers). The spinal deformity index and the number of narrowed disc spaces were significantly positively related to the BPI intensity, interference, and total scores significantly in COPD patients.
   Conclusion: Trunk pain, at least in part, is caused by thoracic vertebral deformity, and costotransverse and intervertebral arthropathy in patients living with COPD. The results of this study provided the foundation for the management of pain, which requires further exploration.

DT Article
DE Acute eosinophilic pneumonia; Bronchoscopy; Eosinophilia; Smoking;
   Corticosteroids
ID CIGARETTE-SMOKING; RESPIRATORY-FAILURE; CLINICAL-IMPLICATIONS;
   LUNG-DISEASES; OUTCOMES
AB Rationale: Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) is a rare but important cause of severe respiratory failure most typically caused by cigarette smoking, but can also be caused by medications, illicit drugs, infections and environmental exposures. There is growing evidence that disease severity varies and not all patients require mechanical ventilation or even supplemental oxygen.
   Objectives: To compare patients with AEP treated at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) to those in other published series, and to provide recommendations regarding diagnosis and treatment of AEP.
   Methods: A retrospective chart review was completed on forty-three cases of AEP which were identified from March 2003 through March 2010 at LRMC, Germany.
   Results: Tobacco smoking was reported by 91% of our patients. Only 33% of patients in our series had a fever (temperature > 100.4 degrees F) at presentation. Peripheral eosinophilia (> 5%) was present in 35% on initial CBC, but was seen in 72% of patients during their hospital course. Hypoxemia, as measured by PaO2/FiO2 ratio, seemed to be less severe in patients with higher levels of bronchoalveolar (BAL) eosinophilia percentage.
   Conclusions: Based on our experience and literature review, we recommend adjustments to the diagnostic criteria which may increase consideration of this etiology for acute respiratory illnesses as well as provide clinical clues we have found particularly helpful. Similar to recent reports of initial peripheral eosinophilia correlating with less severe presentation we found that higher BAL eosinophilia correlated with less severe hypoxemia.

AB Background: The environment in swimming pools, which contain chlorine, might interact with the airway epithelium, resulting in oxidative stress and/or inflammation during high intensity training periods.
   Methods: We evaluated pulmonary functional (metacholine challenge test, FEV1 and VC), cellular (eosinophils and neutrophils), inflammatory (FeNo, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha), oxidative (8-isoprostanes) and angiogenesis factors (VEGF) in induced sputum and peripheral blood of 41 healthy non-asthmatic elite swimmers (median 16 years) during the period of high intensity training before a national championship. The second paired sampling was performed seven months later after training had been stopped for one month.
   Results: There was a ten-fold increase (median 82-924 pg/ml; P < 0.001) in 8-isoprostanes in induced sputum and five-fold increase (median 82-924 pg/ml; P < 0.001) in sera during training in comparison to the period of rest. However, there was no difference in FEV1 (113 vs 116%), VC (119 vs 118%), FeNo (median 34 vs 38 ppb), eosinophils (2.7 vs 2.9% in sputum; 180 vs 165 cells/mu l in blood), neutrophils, different cytokines or VEGF in induced sputum or sera. The only exception was TNF-alpha, which was moderately increased in sera (median 23 vs 40 pg/ml; P=0.02) during the peak training period. Almost half (18 of 41) of swimmers showed bronchial hyperresponsiveness during the peak training period (PC20 cutoff was 4 mg/ml). There was no correlation between hyperresponsiveness and the markers of oxidative stress or inflammation.
   Conclusions: High intensity training in healthy, non-asthmatic competitive swimmers results in marked oxidative stress at the airway and systemic levels, but does not lead to airway inflammation. However, we could not confirm that oxidative stress is associated with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (AHR), which is often observed during the peak exercise training period.

AB Background: Biomarkers in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) are potentially sensitive indicators of early biochemical changes in airways following exposure to pneumotoxic substances, particularly in susceptible subjects. NOx are the stable end products of the nitrite-nitrate-NO oxidative stress pathway and can be used to monitor airway inflammatory diseases, especially in asthma. Nevertheless, population-based surveys are needed to better interpret EBC NOx levels in clinical studies. The aim of this study was to establish reference values of EBC NOx in a large group of middle-aged, healthy adults of a sample of the general population with particular focus on the smoking status.
   Methods: The EBC NOx levels were analysed from 2872 subjects among the ELISABET population-based cross sectional study including a representative sample of men and women aged from 40 to 66 years olds conducted in northern France, which included comprehensive questionnaires by interview and spirometry data. Healthy participants were defined as participants with no self-reported respiratory disease.
   Results: For the healthy subjects (n=1251), the median NOx concentration (IQR) was equal to 7.2 mu M (3.12) and concentrations of NOx in EBC did not differ significantly according to smoking status. The upper fifth percentile (95%) (ULN) of NOx concentrations among healthy subjects was equal to 13.6 mu M, ranging from 12.7 mu M (smokers) to 14.4 mu M (ex smokers). Among subjects with EBC NOx values higher than the ULN and compared with subjects that had EBC NOx values lower than the ULN, we found a significant higher proportion of subjects with current asthma (10.5% vs 6.5%) or with chronic bronchitis symptoms (7.6% vs 3.3%).
   Conclusion: This population-based study has provided the distribution and the upper limit reference value of a nitrosative stress biomarker (NOx) in EBC of middle aged, healthy adults. EBC NOx levels were not associated with smoking status.

SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Bronchial thermoplasty; Safety; Post procedure deterioration;
   Predictors; Manuscript
ID SEVERE ASTHMA; SPIROMETRY; SAFETY
AB Background: The most common adverse effect of bronchial thermoplasty (BT) is short-term aggravation of asthma immediately following the procedure. However, the magnitude and duration of this deterioration, and its predisposing factors are yet to be quantitated. This information will be particularly important as BT is extended to include more severely obstructed patients.
   Methods: In this prospective, observational study of 20 consecutive patients with very severe asthma undergoing BT, post bronchodilator FEV1 was measured in the 30 min prior to surgery, and then 24 h following the 60 procedures. In half the patients, further spirometry was conducted on day 3 and day 7 post procedure.
   Results: This study enrolled 12 males and 8 females, mean age 59.7 +/- 12.8 years, with mean prebronchodilator FEV1 of 52.3 +/- 15.2% predicted, mean forced expiratory ratio of 51.4 +/- 12.6%, and mean improvement in FEV1 post salbutamol of 19.5 +/- 15.3%. All patients were taking inhaled corticosteroids, mean beclomethasone equivalent dose 1950 +/- 857 mcg, and 7 patients required maintenance oral corticosteroids for control of their asthma. Twenty four hours after BT, the mean deterioration in post bronchodilator FEV1 was 166 +/- 237 mls (CI 102-224, p < 0.001) or 9.1 +/- 15.2% of baseline. This deterioration was significantly greater after upper lobe procedures (p < 0.01, ANOVA repeated measures), where a mean fall in FEV1 of 17.1 +/- 12.6% was observed. The change in FEV1 post procedure was significantly correlated with the number of radiofrequency activations applied, r = -0.376, p < 0.005. By multivariate analysis, the only factor other than activations predictive of the change in FEV1 was age, which was protective. When the lower lobes were treated, the postbronchodilator FEV1 had returned to baseline values by day 3, but patients took 7 days to recover after upper lobe treatments. Despite the severity of asthma in these patients, and the measured deterioration post treatment, there was only one instance of readmission in the 60 procedures.
   Conclusions: The deterioration in lung function after BT is transient and well tolerated, but is greatest after upper lobe treatment, and is significantly related to the number of radiofrequency activations applied.

AB Background: Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) remains a significant global health problem. Despite general agreement, an official algorithm for the management of PSP still does not exist.
   Objectives: Evaluating the efficacy of all available treatments in PSP. Methods: A systematic search of 12 electronic databases was performed to identify all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of any treatments in PSP. The primary endpoint was recurrence incidence; secondary were an immediate success, complication and hospitalization days. All available outcomes were included in frequentist network meta-analysis.
   Results: 4262 patients of 29 RCTs were included. In patients with first episode of PSP, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), tube drainage and aspiration had no significant difference regarding recurrence. Chemical pleurodesis significantly reduced the recurrent incidence of 46% compared with aspiration and 54% compared with tube drainage. VATS and aspiration significantly decreased hospitalization days compared with tube drainage. In patients with recurrent or persistent PSP, thoracotomy with mechanical pleurodesis has a higher rank than VATS with or without pleurodesis in preventing recurrence, with no significant difference. VATS alone significantly reduced complications compared with all others treatments, except thoracotomy with abrasion.
   Conclusions: Aspiration and tube drainage have no significant difference in treating patients with first episode of PSP regarding recurrence. Aspiration reduced hospitalization days when compared with tube drainage. Thoracotomy with mechanical pleurodesis and VATS with or without pleurodesis are not significantly different in preventing recurrence in patients with recurrent or persistent PSP. VATS alone reduced complications compared with others treatments except for thoracotomy with abrasion.

   MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS; TRENDS
AB Background: Work-related asthma (WRA) constitutes a significant proportion of all asthma cases and continues to be reported from different industries. The aim of the study was to identify the occupations that can be related to WRA and diagnostic steps used in suspected WRA patients.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of WRA suspected patients who were referred to Ankara Occupational and Environmental Diseases Hospital, Turkey from January 2015 to January 2017. Detailed occupational history, the diagnostic steps such as pulmonary function testing (PFT), peak expiratory flow (PEF) monitoring and nonspecific bronchial provocation tests (NSBPT) were recorded.
   Results: Among 160 patients, 148 were male and 12 were female. Only 2 of them were diagnosed as work-exacerbated asthma (WEA). Diagnosis of asthma was based on using reversible airflow limitation 28.8% (n = 46) or NSBPT 31.9% (n = 51). Toxicological analysis showed that 28 patients had heavy metal poisoning, 9 patients had solvent poisoning, 4 patients had both. According to occupations, 32 of them were ceramic workers (20.0%) and 27 of them were metal workers (16.9%). Plastic workers (4 +/- 2.8 years), cleaners (6.2 +/- 5.7 years), metal workers (7.4 +/- 5.4 years), painters (10 +/- 5.2 years), ceramic workers (10.8 +/- 5.9 years) had the shortest exposure durations for development of occupational asthma (OA). An analysis of variance showed that the effect of heavy metal and solvent poisoning on mean time for onset of OA was not significant.
   Conclusions: The results demonstrate that besides the sectors known to cause WRA, ceramic and metal industries can be related to important exposures related to WRA. Medical surveillance of employees in this sector is important in early detection.

AB Background: When characterizing inhalation products, a comprehensive assessment including in vitro, pharmacokinetic (PK), and clinical data is required. We conducted a characterization of tiotropium Respimat (R) when administered with AeroChamber Plus (R) Flow-Vu (R) anti-static valved holding chamber (test VHC) with face mask in 1-5-year-olds with persistent asthmatic symptoms.
   Methods: In vitro tiotropium dose and particle size distribution delivered into a cascade impactor were evaluated under fixed paediatric and adult flow rates between actuation and samplings. The tiotropium mass likely to reach children's lungs was assessed by tidal breathing simulations and an ADAM-III Child Model. PK exposure to tiotropium in preschool children with persistent asthmatic symptoms (using test VHC) was compared with pooled data from nine Phase 2/3 trials in older children, adolescents, and adults with symptomatic persistent asthma not using test VHC.
   Results: At fixed inspiratory flow rates, emitted mass and fine particle dose decreased under lower flow conditions; dose reduction was observed when Respimat (R) was administered by test VHC at paediatric flow rates. In < 5-year-old children, such a dose reduction is appropriate. In terms of dose per kg/body weight, in vitro-delivered dosing in children was comparable with adults. Transmission and aerosol holding properties of Respimat (R) when administered with test VHC were fully sufficient for aerosol delivery to patients. At zero delay, particles < 5 mu m (most relevant fraction) exhibited a transfer efficacy of >= 60%. The half-time was > 10s, allowing multiple breaths. Standardized tidal inhalation resulted in an emitted mass from the test VHC of approximately one-third of labelled dose, independent of coordination and face mask use, indicating predictable tiotropium administration by test VHC with Respimat (R). Tiotropium exposure in 1-5-year-old patients using the test VHC, when adjusted by height or body surface, was comparable with that in older age groups without VHCs; no overexposure was observed. Adverse events were less frequent with tiotropium (2.5 mu g, n = 20 [55.6%]; 5 mu g, n = 18 [58.1%]) than placebo (n = 25 [73.5%]).
   Conclusions: Our findings provide good initial evidence to suggest that tiotropium Respimat (R) may be administered with AeroChamber Plus (R) Flow-Vu (R) VHC in 1-5-year-old patients with persistent asthmatic symptoms. To confirm the clinical efficacy and safety in these patients, additional trials are required.

AB Pulmonary hypertension has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hemoglobinopathies and chronic hemolytic anemias. These hematological diseases include - but are not limited to - sickle cell disease (SCD), thalassemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hematuria, and hereditary spherocytosis. Although most studies have been based on the use of echocardiography as a screening tool for pulmonary hypertension as opposed to the gold standard of right heart catheterization for definitive diagnosis, the association between chronic hemolytic anemia and pulmonary hypertension is evident. Studies have shown that patients with SCD and a tricuspid regurgitant velocity (TRV) >= 2.5 m/sec are at increased risk of pulmonary hypertension and are at increased mortality risk. Additional markers of risk of pulmonary hypertension and increased mortality include a pro-BNP > 160 pg/mL combined with a 6-min walk distance of < 333 m. There is currently a lack of concrete data to support the use of targeted oral pulmonary arterial hypertension therapy in chronic hemolytic anemia. As a result, management is generally targeted towards medical optimization of the underlying anemia. This literature review aims to discuss the pathophysiology, diagnostic and prognostic tools, recent studies and current protocols that are essential in guiding management of pulmonary hypertension in chronic hemolytic anemias.

ID MILD PERSISTENT ASTHMA; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; LOW-INCOME; CHILDREN
AB Objectives: Guidelines recommend that healthcare providers adjust the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in asthma patients based on the degree of symptom severity and control. Symptom-based, intermittent ICS therapy (use of ICS together with short acting bronchodilators-symptom-based adjustment: SBA) has been demonstrated to be comparable to guideline-based management by providers in controlled clinical trials. We sought input from African American caregivers and pediatricians on the acceptability and barriers for this alternative management strategy.
   Methods: Focus group interviews of caregivers and individual interviews with community providers of African American children ages 6-17 years with mild-moderate persistent asthma were conducted by trained facilitators to assess perceptions of how asthma affects children and their caregivers, and of SBA as a management strategy. Interview data were transcribed and analyzed using inductive thematic based coding.
   Results: Twenty-six parents participated in six focus groups. Fourteen pediatricians were interviewed. Caregivers reported facing financial burden and difficulty with tracking medications. Caregivers and pediatricians were favorable about SBA, citing its potential for decreased use of medications and cost and similarity to actual care provided. Some caregivers voiced concern that SBA would not be as effective as daily ICS. Caregivers suggested that education on symptom recognition and close communication between physician and patient would facilitate the implementation of SBA.
   Conclusions: SBA was generally viewed favorably by caregivers and providers of African American children. However, concerns regarding effectiveness of SBA were voiced by both caregivers and providers. Patient education and provider-patient communication is important in implementing this alternative asthma management strategy.

AB Background: The area of asthma medicine has produced a large volume of important clinical and scientific papers that can be found in those most influential journals. The purpose of our study was to identify the 100 most cited papers in asthma research and to analyze their characteristics.
   Methods: We used the Institute for Scientific Information Web of Knowledge Database to identify the most frequently cited articles published from 1960 to December 2017. Original articles and reviews were included in the study. The 100 top-cited articles were then analyzed with regard to number of citations, publication year, journals, institution, research type and field, authors and countries of authors of publications.
   Results: The 100 top-cited articles in asthma were published between 1960 and 2011 with a median of 933 citations per article (range, 701-2947). The number of citations per article was greatest for articles published in the 1990s. The United States of America contributed most of the classic articles, followed by England. The leading institutions were Imperial College London, McMaster University, Erasmus University Rotterdam. The 100 top-cited articles were published in twenty-five journals, led by The New England Journal of Medicine (21 articles), followed by American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (19 articles), Lancet (11 articles), respectively. Among the 100 classics, 50% articles were clinical research articles.
   Conclusions: Our study provides a historical perspective on the progress of research on asthma. Studies conducted in well-developed European countries and North America, published in high-impact journals had the highest citations.

AB A persistent air leak (PAL) can be caused by either an alveolar-pleural fistula (APF) or bronchopleural fistula (BPF). Complications from PAL lead to an increase in morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospital stay, and higher resource utilization. Pulmonary physicians and thoracic surgeons are often tasked with the difficult and often times frustrating diagnosis and management of PALs. While most patients will improve with chest tube thoracostomy, many will fail requiring alternative bronchoscopic or surgical strategies. Herein, we review the bronchoscopic and surgical diagnostic and treatment options for PAL as it pertains to the field of interventional pulmonology and thoracic surgery.

AB Structure determination of helical specimens commonly requires datasets from thousands of micrographs often obtained by automated cryo-EM data acquisition. Interactive tracing of helical assemblies from such a number of micrographs is labor-intense and time-consuming. Here, we introduce an automated tracing tool MicHelixTrace that precisely locates helix traces from micrographs of rigid as well as very flexible helical assemblies with small numbers of false positives. The computer program is fast and has low computational requirements. In addition to helix coordinates required for a subsequent helical reconstruction work-flow, we determine the persistence length of the polymer ensemble. This information provides a useful measure to characterize mechanical properties of helical assemblies and to evaluate the potential for high-resolution structure determination.

AB Rho family GTPases regulate a wide range of cellular processes. This includes cellular dynamics where three subfamilies, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, are known to regulate cell shape and migration though coordinate action. Activation of Rho proteins largely depends on Rho Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (RhoGEFs) through a catalytic Dbl homology (DH) domain linked to a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that subserves various functions. The PH domains from Lbc RhoGEFs, which specifically activate RhoA, have been shown to bind to activated RhoA. Here, p190RhoGEF is shown to also bind Racl.GTP. Crystal structures reveal that activated Racl and RhoA use their effector-binding surfaces to associate with the same hydrophobic surface on the PH domain. Both activated RhoA and Racl can stimulate exchange of nucleotide on RhoA by localization of p190RhoGEF to its substrate, RhoA.GDP, in vitro. The binding of activated RhoA provides a mechanism for positive feedback regulation as previously proposed for the family of Lbc RhoGEFs. In contrast, the novel interaction between activated Racl and p190RhoGEF reveals a potential mechanism for cross-talk regulation where Rac can directly effect stimulation of RhoA. The greater capacity of Racl to stimulate p190RhoGEF among the Lbc RhoGEFs suggests functional specialization.

AB Microcalcifications (MCs) are routinely used to detect breast cancer in mammography. Little is known, however, about their materials properties and associated organic matrix, or their correlation to breast cancer prognosis. We combine histopathology, Raman microscopy, and electron microscopy to image MCs within snap-frozen human breast tissue and generate micron-scale resolution correlative maps of crystalline phase, trace metals, particle morphology, and organic matrix chemical signatures within high grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive cancer. We reveal the heterogeneity of mineral-matrix pairings, including punctate apatitic particles (<2 mu m) with associated trace elements (e.g., F, Na, and unexpectedly Al) distributed within the necrotic cores of DCIS, and both apatite and spheroidal whitlockite particles in invasive cancer within a matrix containing spectroscopic signatures of collagen, non-collagen proteins, cholesterol, carotenoids, and DNA. Among the three DCIS samples, we identify key similarities in MC morphology and distribution, supporting a dystrophic mineralization pathway. This multimodal methodology lays the groundwork for establishing MC heterogeneity in the context of breast cancer biology, and could dramatically improve current prognostic models.

AB Polynoid worm elytra emit light when mechanically or electrically stimulated. Specialized cells, the photocytes, contain light emitting machineries, the photosomes. Successive stimulations induce light intensity variations and show a coupling within and between photosomes. Here, we describe, using electron tomography of cryo-substituted elytra and freeze-fracturing, the structural transition associated to light emission: undulating tubules come closer, organize and their number forming photosomes increases. Two repeating undulating tubules in opposite phase compose the photosome. Undulations are located on three hexagonal layers that regularly repeat and are equally displaced, in x y and z. The tubule membranes within layers merge giving rise to rings that tend to obey to quasi-rhombohedral symmetry. Merging may result either from close-association, hemifusion (one leaflet fusion) or from fusion (two leaflets fusion). Although the resolution of tomograms is not sufficient to distinguish these three cases, freeze-fracturing shows that hemifusion is a frequent process that leads to an reversible anastomosed membrane complex favoring communications, appearing as a major coupling factor of photosome light emission.

AB Protein complexes are involved in various biological phenomena. These complexes are intrinsically flexible, and structural changes are essential to their functions. To perform a large-scale automated analysis of the structural changes of complexes, we combined two original methods. An application, SCPC, compares two structures of protein complexes and decides the match of binding mode. Another application, Motion Tree, identifies rigid body motions in various sizes and magnitude from the two structural complexes with the same binding mode. This approach was applied to all available homodimers in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We defined two complex-specific motions: interface motion and subunit-spanning motion. In the former, each subunit of a complex constitutes a rigid body, and the relative movement between subunits occurs at the interface. In the latter, structural parts from distinct subunits constitute a rigid body, providing the relative movement spanning subunits. All structural changes were classified and examined. It was revealed that the complex-specific motions were common in the homodimers, detected in around 40% of families. The dimeric interfaces were likely to be small and flat for interface motion, while large and rugged for subunit-spanning motion. Interface motion was accompanied by a drastic change in contacts at the interface, while the change in the subunit-spanning motion was moderate. These results indicate that the interface properties of homodimers correlated with the type of complex-specific motion. The study demonstrates that the pipeline of SCPC and Motion Tree is useful for the massive analysis of structural change of protein complexes.

AB The protist Trypanosoma brucei is an emerging model for the study of cilia and flagella. Here, we used scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) tomography to describe the structure of the trypanosome transition zone (TZ). At the base of the TZ, nine transition fibres irradiate from the B microtubule of each doublet towards the membrane. The TZ adopts a 9 + 0 structure throughout its length of similar to 300 nm and its lumen contains an electron-dense structure. The proximal portion of the TZ has an invariant length of 150 nm and is characterised by a collarette surrounding the membrane and the presence of electron-dense material between the membrane and the doublets. The distal portion exhibits more length variation (from 55 to 235 rim) and contains typical Y-links. STEM analysis revealed a more complex organisation of the Y-links compared to what was reported by conventional transmission electron microscopy. Observation of the very early phase of flagellum assembly demonstrated that the proximal portion and the collarette are assembled early during construction. The presence of the flagella connector that maintains the tip of the new flagellum to the side of the old was confirmed and additional filamentous structures making contact with the membrane of the flagellar pocket were also detected. The structure and potential functions of the TZ in trypanosomes are discussed, as well as its mode of assembly.

AB Nuclear Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) has been associated with worse prognosis and treatment resistance for several cancer types. After Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) binding, the ligand-receptor complex can translocate to the nucleus where it functions in oncological processes. By three-dimensional quantification analysis of super-resolution microscopy images, we verified the translocation kinetics of fluorescent conjugated EGF to the nucleus in two mesenchymal cell types: human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hASC) and SK-HEP-1 tumor cells. The number of EGF clusters in the nucleus does not change after 10 min of stimulation with EGF in both cells. The total volume occupied by EGF clusters in the nucleus of hASC also does not change after 10 min of stimulation with EGF. However, the total volume of EGF clusters increases only after 20 min in SK-HEP-1 cells nuclei. In these cells the nuclear volume occupied by EGF is 3.2 times higher than in hASC after 20 min of stimulation, indicating that translocation kinetics of EGF differs between these two cell types. After stimulation, EGF clusters assemble in larger clusters in the cell nucleus in both cell types, which suggests specific sub-nuclear localizations of the receptor. Super-resolution microscopy images show that EGF clusters are widespread in the nucleoplasm, and can be localized in nuclear envelope invaginations, and in the nucleoli.

AB In bacteria, biosynthesis of riboflavin occurs through a series of enzymatic steps starting with one molecule of GTP and two molecules of ribulose-5-phosphate. In Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) the genes (ribD/G, ribE, ribA, ribH and ribT) which are involved in riboflavin biosynthesis are organized in an operon referred as rib operon. All the genes of rib operon are characterized functionally except for ribT. The ribT gene with unknown function is found at the distal terminal of rib operon and annotated as a putative N-acetyltransferase. Here, we report the crystal structure of ribT from B. subtilis (bribT) complexed with coenzyme A (CoA) at 2.1 angstrom resolution determined by single wavelength anomalous dispersion method. Our structural study reveals that bribT is a member of GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily and contains all the four conserved structural motifs that have been in other members of GNAT superfamily. The members of GNAT family transfers the acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) to a variety of substrates. Moreover, the structural analysis reveals that the residues Glu-67 and Ser-107 are suitably positioned to act as a catalytic base and catalytic acid respectively suggesting that the catalysis by bribT may follow a direct transfer mechanism. Surprisingly, the mutation of a non-conserved amino acid residue Cys-112 to alanine or serine affected the binding of AcCoA to bribT, indicating a possible role of Cys-112 in the catalysis.

AB Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), the key enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway, links methionine metabolism to the biosynthesis of cellular redox controlling molecules. CBS catalyzes the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent condensation of serine and homocysteine to form cystathionine, which is subsequently converted into cysteine. Besides maintaining cellular sulfur amino acid homeostasis, CBS also catalyzes multiple hydrogen sulfide-generating reactions using cysteine and homocysteine as substrates. In mammals, CBS is activated by S-adeno-sylmethionine (AdoMet), where it can adopt two different conformations (basal and activated), but exists as a unique highly active species in fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Here we present the crystal structure of CBS from honeybey Apis mellifera, which shows a constitutively active dimeric species and let explain why the enzyme is not allosterically regulated by AdoMet. In addition, comparison of available CBS structures unveils a substrate induced closure of the catalytic cavity, which in humans is affected by the AdoMet-dependent regulation and likely impaired by the homocystinuria causing mutation T191M.

AB In this work, a novel combined biomass based power generation system is proposed and investigated. The proposed integrated system consists of a combination of biomass gasifier, solid oxide fuel cell, gas turbine cycle and a Rankine cycle. Three different biomasses are selected: Pine Saw Dust, Municipal Solid Waste and Fowl Manure. A comprehensive thermoeconomic analysis as well as a multi-objective optimization is carried out. The effects of most important operating parameters on thermodynamic performance, unit production cost and total cost rate are investigated for the overall system and components. The operating parameters considered include biomass mass flow rate, compression ratio of air compressor, current density of solid oxide fuel cell and exit temperature of solid oxide fuel cell. The results show that the fuel mass flow rate and current density are the dominant factors affecting the variation of energy and exergy efficiencies as well as unit production cost. Moreover, the best thermodynamic and economic performances are corresponded to the Pine Saw Dust fueled system. Nevertheless, the best environmental performance is related to the Fowl Manure fueled system mainly due to the lowest content of CO2 in flue gas leaving the system to the atmosphere.

AB Although the study of co-pyrolysis of coal and biomass have dominated the primary chemicals production in the field of renewable energy utilization, it is still challenging for tar to become lighter. Here we design a set of experimental programs, including the individual pyrolysis, staged catalytic pyrolysis and the co-pyrolysis of physical mixture to investigate the effects of feedstock arrangement on pyrolysis product characteristics. We demonstrated that the experimental results of co-pyrolysis of physical mixture indicate some synergetic effects on pyrolysis products rather than the superposition of individual pyrolysis process of lignite and straw, thus the subsequent tar composition and char structure were characterized. Based on the existing catalytic cracking mechanism, we obtained the staged catalytic pyrolysis have a more pronounced catalytic cracking effect on heavy components compared with the co-pyrolysis of physical mixture, which enables the formation of light oil, naphthalene oil, tar with the lower oxygen content and higher benzene. The Raman spectra of char in catalytic bed exhibits the total peak area of char and the amount of large aromatic ring formed by polymerization increased with the increase of pyrolysis temperature. Simultaneously, the role of catalytic cracking of straw char was stronger than that of lignite char remarkably has been confirmed from the point of view of the chemical structure of char.

AB A new integrated process of biofuel production is introduced and analyzed. This process consists of lignocellulosic biomass fast pyrolysis, gasification, electrical power generation and latest bio-oil upgrading in biorefinery processes. Upgrading processes include hydrotreating, distillation, hydrocracking and steam reforming units. Biomass is converted to bio-oil, gas and bio-char through fast pyrolysis which is then used in biorefinery and gasification. Simulation results show that 1 kg/s hybrid poplar biomass generate about 0.68 kg/s bio-oil, 0.16 kg/s gas and 0.17 kg/s char. Also 5.62 MW electrical power can be gained from the steam cycle. The excess heat of gasification can be used as a part of the required heat source in the process. Moreover the produced syngas is used in the steam reforming unit to provide the required hydrogen in the refinery. In addition, by heat integration the consumption of hot and cold utilities decreased and consequently the process performance improved. The obtained results show that synthetic biofuel yield is about 0.49 wt% and 0.51 wt% gasoline/diesel blendstocks. Moreover economic analysis, sensitivity analysis was also done to study the effects of major operating parameters, i.e., steam reforming temperature, steam/carbon ratio of gasification and greenhouse gas emission, on the process performance.

AB Harvesting energy from human body motion for powering small scale electronic devices is attracting research interest in recent years. Piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) capable of harvesting energy from vibratory movement is a suitable candidate for this particular application. In this study, a cantilever beam with a piezoelectric patch attached at the end of the cantilever is evaluated for potential to harvest energy from human motion. Since the frequency of human walking motion is low, the frequency up conversion technique is adopted in this study to harvest the inertial energy. The effect of orientation of the cantilever beam with tip mass on the efficiency of the power generated is experimentally studied. A prototype is developed and attached onto the leg of a person walking on a treadmill at a constant speed. A theoretical lumped model is adopted to predict the voltage output using the experimentally measured acceleration as input data. Results show close agreement between the experiment and the model. Results also indicate that by varying the orientation of the PEH, the efficiency of the energy harvester can be significantly increased. Maximum power is found to be achieved when the PEH is orientated at 70 with reference to a coordinate system attached to the leg when walking on a treadmill.

AB A comprehensive exergoeconomic comparison of the absorption power and cooling cogeneration cycles based on Kalina is investigated in this study. After thermodynamic and exergoeconomic simulation of the double effect absorption refrigeration/Kalina as well as the first and second configurations of simple absorption refrigeration/Kalina cogeneration cycles, in this part, a widespread parametric study is done and the effects of the simultaneous variations of all studied cogeneration cycles operating parameters are examined on the thermodynamic and exergoeconomic performance of the cogeneration cycles. Also, for a better comparison of the considered cycles, the optimization is done and the considered cogeneration cycles are comprised regarding to five objective functions including the minimum unit cost of products, maximum energy and exergy efficiencies, minimum unit cost of produced exergy and minimum the sum of exergy destruction and capital investment cost rates. Finally, the payback period of the studied cogeneration cycles is calculated in all optimum states. The results show that the minimum unit cost of products for the first configuration of SAR/Kalina cycle is 16.46% and 9.27% less than the corresponding values for the DEAR/Kalina cycle and the second configuration of SAR/Kalina cycle, respectively. Also, the value of C(C) over dot>(D) + <(Z) over dot> parameter for the first configuration of SAR/Kalina cogeneration cycle is 28.32% and 33.12% less than the corresponding values for the second configuration of SAR/Kalina cycle and DEAR/Kalina cycle, respectively. Also, in all optimum states except for the minimum unit cost of produced exergy, the first configuration of SAR/Kalina cycle has the lowest amount of payback period.

AB The decrease in fossil energy reserves and the increase in energy costs have resulted in a strong interest in power generation using renewable heat sources or waste heat. Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is a promising heat-to power conversion technology. Although the ORC using zeotropic mixture is superior to ORC using pure fluid in thermodynamic performance due to low irreversibility during the evaporation and condensation of zeotropic mixture, the improvement in thermodynamic performance is usually achieved at the cost of poor economic performance. The studies on improving the thereto-economic performance are limited. In the present study, a novel zeotropic ORC coupling liquid separation condensation and multi-pressure evaporation is proposed. Multi pressure evaporation is presented to improve heat match between the heat source and working fluid. Liquid separation condensation is applied to control the composition of the mixtures that enter the evaporation processes. Thermodynamic analysis and optimization model of the novel ORC is developed. The superiority of the proposed novel ORC over the traditional simple zeotropic ORC and traditional multi-pressure evaporation zeotropic ORC is elaborated for different mixtures. The contribution of mixture composition adjustment and condensation enhancement through liquid-vapor separation on the cycle performance improvement is investigated. Sensitivity analysis of heat-sink inlet temperature, heat source inlet temperature, vapor quality, heat source specific heat capacity, and heat-sink temperature rise on the cycle performance are conducted. The case results show that net power output of the novel ORC is 13.05-26.18% higher than that of the simple zeotropic ORC. The contribution of mixture composition adjustment on improving the net power output can be up to 3.57% compared with traditional multi-pressure evaporation ORC for mixture R245fa-R365mfc. When the heat transfer enhancement through liquid separation is incorporated into the thermodynamic optimization, the net power output of the novel zeotropic ORC can be increased by 8.22% compared with the traditional multi pressure evaporation ORC under the same economic constraint.

AB Humidification-dehumidification is a carrier gas based thermal technique that is ideal for small-scale water desalination applications. One advantage of humidification-dehumidification systems is the ability to utilize low grade and renewable energies as heat source to drive the system. This work presents theoretical investigation of humidification-dehumidification desalination system operated by a heat pump. The model is based on the first law of thermodynamics, describing heat and mass transfer in the combined humidification-dehumidification heat pump cycle. The model predicts the performance of closed-air open-water water-heated, and modified air heated cycle coupled with a heat pump. To improve the Gain output ratio and energy recovery of the system, a heat pump is used as the source of heating and cooling for the humidification-dehumidification desalination system. Energy rejected in the condenser is used as a source of heat in the humidifier whereas the cooling effect of the evaporator is used to cool incoming seawater for effective condensation of humid air in the dehumidifier. A parametric study is conducted to investigate the influence of system operating parameters, including water and air flowrate, seawater temperature, and refrigerant flow rate on the system performance. Results indicate a maximum Gain output ratio of 8.88 and 7.63 obtained at 80% components effectiveness and mass flow rate ratio of 0.63 and 1.3 for modified air heated and water heated cycle, respectively. A maximum gain output ratio greater than 10 can be achieved for humidifier and dehumidifier effectiveness of 100% leading to more energy efficient systems. The cost of desalinated water production is calculated and the effect of major parameters on its variation is also presented.

AB The efficiency of concentrating photovoltaic cells (CPVs) is highly affected by the cell temperature. The main problems for the cooling devices are insufficient heat dissipation and uneven heat distribution. In this study, a novel cooling manifold with multi-channels for densely packed CPVs were proposed and numerical investigated. The effects of coolant type, inlet flow rate and channel dimensions on the cooling performance of the manifold heat sink device were examined. The influence of solar irradiance was also investigated at four solar terms in Shenzhen, China. The results show that great cooling performance and temperature distribution uniformity can be achieved by the novel cooling manifold. Thermal resistance of the studied manifold is also lower than those reported in the literature.

AB This paper presents a model of a diesel-combustion-engine-based variable speed generation unit driving a permanent magnet generator loaded by a power converter. Variable speed operation of the internal combustion engine facilitates fuel saving when the load profile changes, but it requires a power conditioning unit such as an electronic converter. Power converter operation is well known from wind energy conversion systems, in which variable speed operation increases their efficiency. The paper presents modeling and speed control of an exemplary diesel engine, and control of output voltage and current of the power electronics converter loading the generator. Special attention has been paid to elaboration of the methods of minimum specific fuel consumption points tracking for the given load. Incremental algorithms can find minimum specific fuel consumption in the case in which the details of fuel consumption curves are not exactly known. The incremental algorithm has been adopted from wind energy conversion systems and partly modified to avoid torque peaks during incremental step changes of reference speed. The concept has been validated in a simulation using data of a real model of an internal combustion engine through a three-dimensional approximation of fuel consumption characteristics.

AB Torrefaction followed by densification improves the heating value, grindability, and logistical treatment efficiency of biomass. Study of the pyrolysis and gasification of torrefied biomass pellets has great significance for the efficient conversion and utilization of biomass. In this study, the thermal behavior and reaction kinetics of pyrolysis and following in-situ CO2 gasification of torrefied corn stalk pellets were investigated in a macro-thermogravimetric analyzer. Torrefaction reduced the amounts of volatiles released during pyrolysis and the maximum pyrolysis rate of pellets decreased with the increase of torrefaction temperature. A three-pseudo component model applied for the pellet pyrolysis process suggested that the contribution of hemicellulose reduced as indicated by a decrease in activation energy, while lignin contributed more to the overall kinetics with the increased torrefaction temperature. The gasification of chars after the pyrolysis of torrefied pellets based on the nucleation and growth model indicated that as the torrefaction temperature increased, the gasification reactivity decreased, as implied by the evolutions of pore structures, ash compositions and graphitized crystal structures of the pellet pyrolysis chars. The higher activation energy increased the reaction resistance during the pellet gasification process. The results showed that torrefaction and densification together influenced the reaction behavior, reactivity and overall kinetics of biomass.

AB The use of hydrogen as transportation fuel is considered to be a favourable alternative to fossil fuels. It is believed that the development of fuel cell vehicles will greatly facilitate reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector due to the fact that these vehicles are fuelled by hydrogen, which can be produced by a wide range of processes using renewable energy sources. In order to promote the use of fuel cell vehicles, it is imperative to build the necessary facilities to support this need in the near future, including hydrogen refuelling stations powered by renewable power generation systems. In this study, techno-economic analysis was performed for a hydrogen refuelling station powered by two types of hybrid renewable power generation systems (wind-photovoltaic-battery and wind-battery systems) which will be installed on the island of Gokceada, Turkey. The analysis was carried out to assess the feasibility of the hydrogen refuelling station to refuel 25 vehicles on a daily basis throughout the year, using HOMER software. Based on the results, the levelized cost of hydrogen for the hydrogen refuelling station powered by the hybrid wind-photovoltaic-battery and wind-battery systems is $ 8.92/kg and $ 11.08/kg, respectively. The levelized cost of hydrogen was also determined for different variable parameters (wind speed, wind turbine hub height, solar irradiance, and project lifetime). It is concluded that the hydrogen refuelling station powered by the proposed renewable power generation systems may be feasible for the chosen site.

AB Hydrocarbon/carbon systems can be used to perform the hydrogen transfer reaction in heavy oil upgrading, as alternatives to metal catalysts and molecular hydrogen. In this study, a system comprising a hydrogen-donor solvent (tetralin) and acid-treated activated carbon was established to evaluate its ability as a hydrogen transfer agent to upgrade a vacuum residue (VR). The use of tetralin substantially decreased coke formation from 32.7 wt % to a negligible amount in VR upgrading at 450 degrees C because the solvent could act as a hydrogen donor and diluent for the coke precursors. The acid-treated activated carbon accelerated dehydrogenation of tetralin through hydrogen transfer in the upgrading, resulting in a higher residue conversion and moderate coke formation. In view of the phase behavior, the hydrogen transfer reaction could also be promoted by increasing the contact between the hydrogen acceptor and donor in the supercritical medium. In the VR upgrading using the activated carbon in supercritical tetralin, complete residue conversion was achieved with 47 wt% light fractions (gas and light oil) and 6 wt% coke at 450 degrees C and 5.33 MPa. The results indicate that the streams available in oil refinery processes, which are rich in hydrocarbons with hydrogen-donor abilities, have great potential for use in heavy oil upgrading.

AB Disposal of waste plastic accumulated in landfills is critical from the environmental perspective. The energy embodied in waste plastic could be recovered by catalytic pyrolysis as waste plastic oil (WPO) and could be recycled as a fuel for diesel engines. This method presents a sustainable solution for waste plastic management as the gap between global plastic production and waste plastic generation keeps widening. The present study investigates the combined influence of EGR and injection timing on the combustion, performance and emission characteristics of a DI diesel engine fueled with neat WPO. Experiments were conducted at three injection timings (21 degrees, 23 degrees and 25 degrees CA bTDC) and EGR rates (10, 20 and 30%) at the engine's rated power output. When compared to diesel, the combustion event occurred closer to the TDC when the injection timing is delayed from 25 degrees CA bTDC to 21 degrees CA bTDC. The peak in-cylinder pressures and HRRs dropped gradually as the injection timing was delayed from 25 degrees CA bTDC to 21 degrees CA bTDC at all EGR rates. The engine delivered diesel-like fuel consumption with 5.1% higher brake thermal efficiency. NOx decreased up to 52.4% under 30% EGR when WPO was injected lately 21 degrees CA bTDC. Smoke density remained lower by 46% and 9.5% for 10% and 20% EGR rates respectively for WPO only at early injection timing of 25 degrees CA bTDC. HC and CO emissions stayed lower at early injection timing of 25 degrees CA bTDC under 10% EGR. WPO injected at the advanced injection timing of 25 degrees CA bTDC and low EGR rate of 10% was found to simultaneously reduce smoke and NOx by 46% and 38% respectively.

AB Most firms use secrecy to protect their knowledge from potential imitators. However, the theoretical foundations for secrecy have not been well explored. We extend knowledge protection literature and propose theoretical mechanisms explaining how information visibility influences the importance of secrecy as a knowledge protection instrument. Building on mechanisms from information economics and signaling theory, we postulate that secrecy is more important for protecting knowledge for firms that have legal requirements to reveal information to shareholders. Furthermore, we argue that this effect is contingent on the location in a technological cluster, on a firm's investment in fixed assets and on a firm's past innovation performance. We test our hypotheses using a representative sample of 683 firms in Germany between 2005 and 2013. Our results support the moderation effect of a technological cluster and a firm's investment in fixed assets. Our findings inform both academics and managers on how firms balance information disclosure requirements with the use of secrecy as a knowledge protection instrument.

AB Although China is now the largest patent filing country in the world, research on the duration and outcomes of patent examination remains scarce. In this study, we conduct a replication and extension of Harhoff and Wagner's (2009) work on the determinants of patent examination duration at the European Patent Office (EPO), using a rich dataset covering the population of about 1.1 million invention patent applications to China's State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) from 1993 to 2006. By considering all three competing examination outcomes (grant, withdrawal, and refusal) simultaneously, our competing risks analysis replicates many of the results in prior research and confirms that a number of the determinants have differential effects on pendencies for different outcomes. Our analysis also reveals several applicant and application characteristics whose effects on pendencies for specific outcomes differ from prior research. Finally, by incorporating a number of new determinants, we report a set of new findings about their effects on the examination duration for the three outcomes at SIPO.

AB External collaboration breadth is important for firms to acquire the knowledge needed to innovate. In this paper, we combine cross-sectional and longitudinal data from the Spanish Panel of Technological Innovation Survey (PITEC) to examine the indirect impact of R&D subsidies on firm external collaboration breadth. We contribute to understanding of the indirect impacts of R&D subsidies by first providing strong evidence of an economically significant average positive impact of R&D subsidies on firm external collaboration breadth. Second, our results advance understanding of the differential impacts of R&D subsidies by revealing the vast heterogeneity of the impact at the firm level, where approximately only half of treated firms experience a positive collaboration impact from R&D subsidies, while the remainder experience no impact or a negative effect. Finally, we advance understanding of the characteristics explaining the differential impact of R&D subsidies on external collaboration breadth by utilising the organisational learning literature to demonstrate the important role of firm collaboration experience.

AB While startups are the center of extensive policy discussion given their outsized role in job creation, it is not clear whether they create high quality jobs relative to incumbent firms. This paper investigates the wage differential between venture capital-backed startups and established firms, given that the two firm types compete for talent. Using data on MIT graduates, I find that non-founder employees at VC-backed startups earn roughly 10% higher wages than their counterparts at established firms. To account for unobserved heterogeneity across workers, I exploit the fact that many MIT graduates receive multiple job offers. I find that wage differentials are statistically insignificant from zero when individual fixed effects are included. This implies that much of the startup wage premium in the cross-section can be attributed to selection, and that VC-backed startups pay competitive wages for talent. To unpack the selection mechanism, I show that individual preferences for risk as well as challenging work strongly predict entry into VC-backed startups.

AB Entrepreneurship as a scientific field has grown significantly, irrespective of the measures used. In this article we raise the question: How can we understand the evolution and success of entrepreneurship as a scholarly field? In particular, we focus on the social structure of entrepreneurship scholars to explain (1) how they are becoming integrated into larger scholarly communities and (2) how they differ from the way scholars integrate within the field of innovation studies. Based on a unique database and responses from 870 entrepreneurship scholars, we demonstrate that entrepreneurship can be regarded as a phenomenon-driven field bound together by a shared communication system and social interaction rather than strong theoretical influences, i.e., a social scholarly community. We identify two broader social communities; one embedded in entrepreneurship conferences that includes a rather eclectic group of entrepreneurship scholars, and another related to entrepreneurship journals and entrepreneurship economics, characterized by a stronger domain orientation. In contrast, scholars in innovation studies tend to be more theory-driven and are bound together by their disciplinary and theoretical background, i.e., an intellectual scholarly community.

AB Clusters face what has been referred to as a 'cluster paradox'; a situation in which a collective identity breeds cohesion and efficiency in inter-organisational collaboration, yet it hinders the variety needed to adapt to disruptive change and prevent lock-in situations. Accordingly, a recurring theme in the literature on cluster evolution and cluster life-cycles is the need for constant renewal to allow clusters to adapt to a changing environment. However, how individual firms enact a process of cluster renewal and consider possible response options is not well understood. Using a French energy cluster as empirical setting, this paper investigates individual members' enactment of the renewal in terms of how it could affect their current position, both structurally and relationally, and to what extent members felt that they had agency to steer the process to safeguard their position. The findings show that members' enactment of the proposed change does not only depend on the perceived impact of cluster renewal on the member itself but also on the impact the renewal might have on other members in the firm's network. The analysis also suggests that cluster renewal leads to a leadership vacuum where it is not clear who, if anyone, will lead the renewal process.

AB This study focuseson the dispersion and diffusion characteristics of high-order energy-stable flux reconstruction (ESFR) schemes via the spatial eigensolution analysis framework proposed in [1]. The analysis is performed for five ESFR schemes, where the parameter 'c' dictating the properties of the specific scheme recovered is chosen such that it spans the entire class of ESFR methods, also referred to as VCJH schemes, proposed in [2]. In particular, we used five values of 'c', two that correspond to its lower and upper bounds and the others that identify three schemes that are linked to common high-order methods, namely the ESFR recovering two versions of discontinuous Galerkin methods and one recovering the spectral difference scheme. The performance of each scheme is assessed when using different numerical intercell fluxes (e.g. different levels of upwinding), ranging from "under-" to "over-upwinding". In contrast to the more common temporal analysis, the spatial eigensolution analysis framework adopted here allows one to grasp crucial insights into the diffusion and dispersion properties of FR schemes for problems involving non-periodic boundary conditions, typically found in open-flow problems, including turbulence, unsteady aerodynamics and aeroacoustics.

AB We develop a second-order well-balanced central-upwind scheme for the compressible Euler equations with gravitational source term. Here, we advocate a new paradigm based on a purely conservative reformulation of the equations using global fluxes. The proposed scheme is capable of exactly preserving steady-state solutions expressed in terms of a nonlocal equilibrium variable. A crucial step in the construction of the second-order scheme is a well-balanced piecewise linear reconstruction of equilibrium variables combined with a well-balanced central-upwind evolution in time, which is adapted to reduce the amount of numerical viscosity when the flow is at (near) steady-state regime. We show the performance of our newly developed central-upwind scheme and demonstrate importance of perfect balance between the fluxes and gravitational forces in a series of one- and two-dimensional examples.

AB In this work, a consistent Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model to deal with interfacial multiphase fluid flows simulation is proposed. A modification to the Continuum Stress Surface formulation (CSS) [1] to enhance the stability near the fluid interface is developed in the framework of the SPH method. A non-conservative first-order consistency operator is used to compute the divergence of stress surface tensor. This formulation benefits of all the advantages of the one proposed by Adami et al.[2] and, in addition, it can be applied to more than two phases fluid flow simulations. Moreover, the generalized wall boundary conditions [3] are modified in order to be well adapted to multiphase fluid flows with different density and viscosity. In order to allow the application of this technique to wall-bounded multiphase flows, a modification of generalized wall boundary conditions is presented here for using the SPH method. In this work we also present a particle redistribution strategy as an extension of the damping technique presented in [3] to smooth the initial transient phase of gravitational multiphase fluid flow simulations. Several computational tests are investigated to show the accuracy, convergence and applicability of the proposed SPH interfacial multiphase model. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The method of regularized stokeslets is extensively used in biological fluid dynamics due to its conceptual simplicity and meshlessness. This simplicity carries a degree of cost in computational expense and accuracy because the number of degrees of freedom used to discretise the unknown surface traction is generally significantly higher than that required by boundary element methods. We describe a meshless method based on nearest-neighbour interpolation that significantly reduces the number of degrees of freedom required to discretise the unknown traction, increasing the range of problems that can be practically solved, without excessively complicating the task of the modeller. The nearest-neighbour technique is tested against the classical problem of rigid body motion of a sphere immersed in very viscous fluid, then applied to the more complex biophysical problem of calculating the rotational diffusion timescales of a macromolecular structure modelled by three closely-spaced non-slender rods. Aheuristic for finding the required density of force and quadrature points by numerical refinement is suggested. Matlab/GNU Octave code for the key steps of the algorithm is provided, which predominantly use basic linear algebra operations, with a full implementation being provided on github. Compared with the standard Nystrom discretisation, more accurate and substantially more efficient results can be obtained by de-refining the force discretisation relative to the quadrature discretisation: a cost reduction of over 10 times with improved accuracy is observed. This improvement comes at minimal additional technical complexity. Future avenues to develop the algorithm are then discussed. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper we develop a conservative cell-centered Lagrangian finite volume scheme for the solution of the hydrodynamics equations on unstructured multidimensional grids. The method is derived from the Eucclhyd scheme discussed in [47,43,45]. It is second-order accurate in space and is combined with the a posteriori Multidimensional Optimal Order Detection (MOOD) limiting strategy to ensure robustness and stability at shock waves. Second-order of accuracy in time is achieved via the ADER (Arbitrary high order schemes using DERivatives) approach. A large set of numerical test cases is proposed to assess the ability of the method to achieve effective second order of accuracy on smooth flows, maintaining an essentially non-oscillatory behavior on discontinuous profiles, general robustness ensuring physical admissibility of the numerical solution, and precision where appropriate.

AB In this work we propose an improvement to the Wang-Landau (WL) method that allows an economy in CPU time of about 60% leading to the same results with the same accuracy. We used the 2D Ising model to show that one can initiate all WL simulations using the outputs of an advanced WL level from a previous simulation. We showed that up to the seventh WL level (f(6)) the simulations are not biased yet and can proceed to any value that the simulation from the very beginning would reach. As a result the initial WL levels can be simulated just once. It was also observed that the saving in CPU time is larger for larger lattice sizes, exactly where the computational cost is considerable. We carried out high-resolution simulations beginning initially from the first WL level (f(0)) and another beginning from the eighth WL level (f(7)) using all the data at the end of the previous level and showed that the results for the critical temperature T-c and the critical static exponents beta and gamma coincide within the error bars. Finally we applied the same procedure to the 1/2-spin Baxter-Wu model and the economy in CPU time was of about 64%. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB It is challenge work to design parareal algorithms for time-fractional differential equations due to the historical effect of the fractional operator. A direct extension of the classical parareal methodto such equations will lead to unbalance computational time in each process. In this work, we present an efficient parareal iteration scheme to overcome this issue, by adopting two recently developed local time-integrators for time fractional operators. In both approaches, one introduces auxiliary variables to localized the fractional operator. To this end, we propose a new strategy to perform the coarse grid correction so that the auxiliary variables and the solution variable are corrected separately in a mixed pattern. It is shown that the proposed parareal algorithm admits robust rate of convergence. Numerical examples are presented to support our conclusions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A generic particle-mesh method using a hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) frame-work is presented and validated for the solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Building upon particle-in-cell concepts, the method is formulated in terms of an operator splitting technique in which Lagrangian particles are used to discretize an advection operator, and an Eulerian mesh-based HDG method is employed for the constitutive modeling to account for the inter-particle interactions. Key to the method is the variational framework provided by the HDG method. This allows to formulate the projections between the Lagrangian particle space and the Eulerian finite element space in terms of local (i.e. cellwise) l(2)-projections efficiently. Furthermore, exploiting the HDG framework for solving the constitutive equations results in velocity fields which excellently approach the incompressibility constraint in a local sense. By advecting the particles through these velocity fields, the particle distribution remains uniform over time, obviating the need for additional quality control. The presented methodology allows for a straightforward extension to arbitrary-order spatial accuracy on general meshes. A range of numerical examples shows that optimal convergence rates are obtained in space and, given the particular time stepping strategy, second-order accuracy is obtained in time. The model capabilities are further demonstrated by presenting results for the flow over a backward facing step and for the flow around a cylinder. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The 2D front tracking method is enhanced to control the development of spurious velocities for non-uniform distributions of markers. The hybrid formulation of Shin et al. (2005) [7] is considered. A new tangent calculation is proposed for the calculation of the tension force at markers. A new reconstruction method is also proposed to manage non-uniform distributions of markers. We show that for both the static and the translating spherical drop test case the spurious currents are reduced to the machine precision. We also show that the ratio of the Lagrangian grid size Delta s over the Eulerian grid size Delta x has to satisfy Delta s/Delta x > 0.2 for ensuring such low level of spurious velocity. The method is found to provide very good agreement with benchmark test cases from the literature. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this work we investigate the Runge-Kutta (RK)/Implicit smoother scheme as a convergence accelerator for complex multi-physics flow problems including turbulent, reactive and also two-phase flows. The flows considered are subsonic, transonic and supersonic flows in complex geometries, and also can be either steady or unsteady flows. All of these problems are considered to be a very stiff.
   We then introduce an acceleration method for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We start with the multigrid method for pure subsonic flow, including reactive flows. We then add the Rossow-Swanson-Turkel RK/Implicit smoother that enables performing all these complex flow simulations with a reasonable CFL number. We next discuss the RK/Implicit smoother for time dependent problem and also for low Mach numbers. The preconditioner includes an intrinsic low Mach number treatment inside the smoother operator. We also develop a modified Roe scheme with a corresponding flux Jacobian matrix. We then give the extension of the method for real gas and reactive flow. Reactive flows are governed by a system of inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations with very stiff source terms. The extension of the RK/Implicit smoother requires an approximation of the source term Jacobian. The properties of the Jacobian are very important for the stability of the method. We discuss what the chemical physics theory of chemical kinetics tells about the mathematical properties of the Jacobian matrix. We focus on the implication of the Le-Chatelier's principle on the sign of the diagonal entries of the Jacobian. We present the implementation of the method for turbulent flow. We use a two RANS turbulent model - one equation model - Spalart-Allmaras and a two-equation model - k-omega SST model. The last extension is for two-phase flows with a gas as a main phase and Eulerian representation of a dispersed particles phase (EDP). We present some examples for such flow computations inside a ballistic evaluation rocket motor.
   The numerical examples in this work include transonic flow about a RAE2822 airfoil, about a M6 Onera wing, NACA0012 airfoil at very low Mach number, two-phase flow inside a Ballistic evaluation motor (BEM), a turbulent reactive shear layer and a time dependent Sod's tube problem.

AB New multidimensional extensions of the TVD and finite difference ENO/WENO methods for the compressible flow equations are proposed. The novelty of the approach is in the discretization schemes that acquire by means of a single mechanism both shock-capturing and vorticity confinement capabilities.

AB In this paper, a fast linearized conservative finite element method is studied for solving the strongly coupled nonlinear fractional Schrodinger equations. We prove that the scheme preserves both the mass and energy, which are defined by virtue of some recursion relationships. Using the Sobolev inequalities and then employing the mathematical induction, the discrete scheme is proved to be unconditionally convergent in the sense of L-2-norm and H-alpha/2-norm, which means that there are no any constraints on the grid ratios. Then, the prior bound of the discrete solution in L-2-norm and L-infinity-norm are also obtained. Moreover, we propose an iterative algorithm, by which the coefficient matrix is independent of the time level, and thus it leads to Toeplitz-like linear systems that can be efficiently solved by Krylov subspace solvers with circulant preconditioners. This method can reduce the memory requirement of the proposed linearized finite element scheme from O(M-2) to O(M) and the computational complexity from O(M-3) to O(M log M) in each iterative step, where M is the number of grid nodes. Finally, numerical results are carried out to verify the correction of the theoretical analysis, simulate the collision of two solitary waves, and show the utility of the fast numerical solution techniques.

TI The Optiflow (TM) interface for chronic CPAP use in children
SO SLEEP MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is being increasingly used in children of all age ranges. The limited number of commercially available masks especially in infants and young children may complicate its use and compliance. In this report, we describe our experience with the use of the Optiflow (TM) (Fisher and Paykel Healthcare) Nasal Cannula attached to a regular CPAP device in the setting of chronic CPAP use. This interface consists of a nasal cannula and was originally designed for the delivery of high-flow oxygen therapy. We could show an objective improvement in breathing parameters in several children selected for CPAP mainly because of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). However, this interface cannot be used for bilevel non-invasive ventilation due to insufficient triggering. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To clarify the relationship between nighttime sleep duration, midday naps, and glycemic control in Japanese patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (n = 355) or impaired glucose tolerance (n = 43).
   Methods: A total of 398 patients completed a self-administered questionnaire on sleep duration/quality and were divided into five groups according to their self-reported nighttime sleep duration: <5 h, 5-6 h, 6-7 h, 7-8 h, and >8 h. Each group was further divided into two subgroups each according to the presence or absence of midday naps. Poor glycemic control was defined as HbA1c >= 7.0%.
   Results: Short nighttime sleep (<5 h), poor sleep induction, daytime sleepiness, and low sleep satisfaction were associated with high HbA1c levels. HbA1c was higher in the short nighttime sleep/no nap group than in non-nappers with different nighttime sleep duration, whereas the short nighttime sleep/nap group showed similar HbA1c levels to the other nap subgroups. In multivariate logistic regression models, after adjusting for a number of potential confounders, short (<5 h) nighttime sleep without nap was significantly associated with poor glycemic control compared with 6-7 h nighttime sleep without nap (OR [95% CI]: 7.14 [2.20-23.20]). However, taking naps reduced this risk for poor glycemic control in short sleepers. Other risk factors for poor glycemic control were low sleep satisfaction (1.73 [1.10-2.70]) and poor sleep induction (1.69 [1.14-2.50]).
   Conclusions: Poor sleep quality and quantity could aggravate glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Midday naps could mitigate the deleterious effects of short nighttime sleep on glycemic control. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Sleep affects adolescents in various ways. However, the effects of multiple factors on sleep hygiene remain unclear. A comprehensive assessment of the effects of life habits on sleep in high-school students was conducted.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 344 high school students (age range 15-17; 171 boys, 173 girls) in Tokyo, Japan was conducted in 2015. Complete responses were provided by 294 students. Demographic variables, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), diurnal type scale, Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS), and life habits such as dinnertime, viewing electronic displays, caffeine intake, sunlight in the morning, and the brightness of the room in the night were asked.
   Results: The mean scores were PSQI: 5.9 (+/- 2.3), PDSS: 19.0 (+/- 5.8), and the diurnal type scale: 16.7(+/- 3.4). Using an electronic display in bed (OR = 3.01; (95%CI) 1.24-7.30), caffeine intake at night always (OR = 2.22; 1.01-4.90), and waking up before dawn (OR = 3.25; 1.34-7.88) were significantly associated with sleep disturbance. Irregular timing of the evening meal (OR = 2.06; 1.10-3.84) and display viewing within 2 h before bedtime (OR = 2.50; 1.01-6.18) or in bed (OR = 3.60; 1.41-9.21) were significantly associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. Using an electronic display within 2 h before bedtime (OR = 2.64; 1.10-6.38) or in bed (OR = 3.50; 1.40-8.76) and a living room which is bright at night (OR = 1.89; 1.06-3.36) were significantly associated with eveningness.
   Conclusion: Each type of sleep-related problem had its own associated life habit factors. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Prospective memory is defined as remembering to do something at a particular moment in the future and may be modulated by sleep. Here, we investigated whether multiple nights of partial sleep deprivation would affect the successful retrieval of intentions. Fifty-nine adolescents (mean age +/- SD: 16.1 +/- 0.6 years) were instructed to remember to press specific keys in response to the target words presented during a semantic categorization task in the future. Their memory was tested after five nights of either 5-h (sleep restriction group) or 9-h time-in-bed (control group). The average percentage of target words correctly responded to was small and did not significantly differ between the two groups (mean +/- SEM for the sleep restriction group: 15.52 +/- 6.61%; the control group: 23.33 +/- 7.48%, p = 0.44). Thus, after the extended retention interval, prospective remembering was poor and did not appear to be affected by post-learning sleep restriction. These findings suggest a temporal boundary beyond which intentions fall below requisite levels of activation, potentially masking any benefits for retrieval conferred by sleep. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Insomnia, hypersomnia and REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RSBD) during sleep are major problems for patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) but they are also used to predict its onset. While these secondary symptoms detract from the quality of life in PD patients, few treatment options are available due to limited efficacy or risk of complicating the treatment regimen. Light therapy (LT) has been suggested as a strategy for sleep disorders but it has only been implemented recently for use in PD. An open label, retrospective study was undertaken where PD patients had been undergoing LT, using polychromatic light, for four months to 15 years prior. It was found that 1 h exposure to light, just prior to retiring, significantly improved insomnia and reduced RSBD in as little as one month after commencing LT. In addition, the improvement was maintained as long as LT was continued over a four to six year period. The efficacy of LT in alleviating these sleep related conditions was not compromised by time since diagnosis or age of the patient. These results intimate the value of long term application of non-invasive techniques such as LT for treating sleep disorders in PD and justify further controlled trials on the long term efficacy of LT.

   Methods: Among 3874 Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) participants without prevalent CVD, moderate to severe OSA was defined by an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) >= 15 on an in-home polysomnography. EDS was defined as an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score >= 11. Incident CVD events included total CVD events (coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke), as well as CHD and stroke separately. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, alcohol, smoking, and body mass index.
   Results: Compared to those with AHI <15, the hazard ratios (95% CI) for the association of moderate severe OSA (AHI >= 15) were as follows: CVD 1.06 (0.85-1.33); CHD 1.08 (0.85-1.33); and stroke 1.18 (0.75-1.84). Weak associations between EDS and CVD risk = [1.22 (1.01-1.47)] and CHD risk [1.25 (1.02 -1.53)] were present, however there were none for stroke risk [1.10 (0.75-1.63)]. When jointly modeled, both AHI >= 15 and EDS (compared with having AHI <15 and no EDS) was associated with HRs of 1.26 (0.91-1.73) for CVD, 1.24 (0.87-1.75) for CHD and 1.49 (0.78-2.86) for stroke. There were no statistically significant interactions between daytime sleepiness and OSA on the multiplicative or additive scales.
   Conclusions: Having both EDS and moderate-severe OSA was not associated with an increased risk of CVD in the SHHS data. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing evidence indicates a strong association between rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and Parkinson's disease - cognitive impairment (PD-CI). Numerous longitudinal and cross-sectional studies have shown that RBD may be an important risk factor and predictor of Parkinson's disease mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD); which may be explained by the association of mechanisms between RBD and PD-CI, including neurotransmitter alterations, genetic mutation, neuroinflammation, alpha-synuclein inclusion, abnormal cerebral metabolism and cortical activity slowing. Understanding the role of RBD in cognition of PD, we may predict and prevent the presence of PD-CI. The purpose of our comprehensive narrative review was to investigate the role of RBD in cognition of PD patients and its possible mechanism with lights from clinical epidemiological evidence, neuroimaging and electrophysiology studies.

AB Study objectives: The objective of this study is to assess adherence and persistence of ropinirole, pramipexole, and gabapentin; to investigate factors associated with non-adherence and non-persistence in restless legs syndrome (RLS) patients.
   Methods: We used the 2008-2014 Marketscan (R) Research Databases to conduct a retrospective data analysis. The study included newly diagnosed RLS patients who initiated ropinirole, pramipexole, or gabapentin therapy. During 365 days of follow-up, mean medication possession ratios (MPRs) for adherence and the proportion of adherent users were calculated. The mean persistence (time to discontinuation) and the proportion of persistent users were also assessed during the same follow-up period. Factors associated with non-adherence and non-persistence were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression.
   Results: This study included 5163 ropinirole, 3380 pramipexole, and 1353 gabapentin users. The mean MPRs for ropinirole, pramipexole, and gabapentin were 0.52, 0.52, and 0.48, respectively. The proportions of adherent users were 33.2%, 34.6%, and 27.4%, respectively. Mean time to treatment discontinuation was 158 days, 158 days, and 145 days, respectively. The proportions of persistent users at 365 days were 25.0%, 25.8%, and 20.6%, respectively. Younger age, higher number of concomitant medications, and gabapentin use (vs. ropinirole or pramipexole use) were positively associated with non-adherence and non-persistence. Additionally, retail pharmacy use (vs. mail order pharmacy use) and use of benzodiazepines were positively associated with non-adherence.
   Conclusion: Adherence and persistence to ropinirole, pramipexole, and gabapentin were low in newly diagnosed RLS patients during 365 days of follow-up. Certain patient characteristics were predictors of non-adherence and non-persistence. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Type 1 narcolepsy (NT1) is a central hypersomnia linked to the destruction of hypocretin-producing neurons. A great body of genetic and epidemiological data points to likely autoimmune disease aetiology. Recent reports have characterized peripheral blood T-cell subsets in NT1, whereas data regarding the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) immune cell composition are lacking. The current study aimed to characterize the T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell subsets in NT1 patients with long disease course.
   Methods: Immune cell subsets from CSF and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were analysed by flow cytometry in two age-balanced and sex-balanced groups of 14 NT1 patients versus 14 healthy controls. The frequency of CSF cell groups was compared with PBMCs. Non-parametric tests were used for statistical analyses.
   Results: The NT1 patients did not show significant differences of CSF immune cell subsets compared to controls, despite a trend towards higher CD4(+) terminally differentiated effector memory T cells. T cells preferentially displayed a memory phenotype in the CSF compared to PBMCs. Furthermore, a reduced frequency of CD4(+) terminally differentiated effector memory T cells and an increased frequency of NK CD56(bright) cells was observed in PBMCs from patients compared to controls. Finally, the ratio between CSF and peripheral CD4(+) terminally differentiated effector memory T cells was two-fold increased in NT1 patients versus controls.
   Conclusions: Significant differences in PBMCs and in CSF/PBMC ratios of immune cell profile were found in NT1 patients compared to healthy controls. These differences might have arisen from the different HLA status, or be primary or secondary to hypocretin deficiency. Further functional studies in patients close to disease onset are required to understand NT1 pathophysiology. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and purpose: Sleep disturbances in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are common and may impair daytime functioning as well as add to parental burden. In this well characterized sample of young children with ASD and disruptive behaviors, we examine the association of age and IQ in sleep disturbances using the Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire modified for ASD (CSHQ-ASD). We also test whether children with poor sleep have greater daytime behavioral problems than those with better sleep. Finally, we examine whether parental stress is higher in children with greater disruptive behaviors and sleep disturbances.
   Participants and methods: One hundred and seventy-seven children with complete data out of 180 (mean age 4.7) with ASD participated in a randomized clinical trial. Parents completed the CSHQ-ASD and several other measures at study enrollment. The sample was divided into "poor sleepers" (upper quartile on the total score of the CSHQ-ASD) and "good sleepers" (lower quartile) for comparisons. Analyses were conducted to evaluate group differences on age, IQ daytime disruptive behavior, social disability and parental stress.
   Results: The two groups of young children with ASD, good sleepers versus poor sleepers, were not different on age or cognitive level. Children in the poor sleeping group had significantly higher daytime behavioral problems including irritability, hyperactivity, social withdrawal and stereotypical behaviors. Parents in this group reported significantly higher levels of stress.
   Conclusions: The finding of no age difference between good and poor sleepers in young children with ASD and disruptive behaviors suggests that sleep problems are unlikely to resolve as might be expected in typically developing children. Likewise, the good and poor sleepers did not significantly differ in IQ. These findings add strong support for the need to screen for sleep disturbances in all children with ASD, regardless of age and cognitive level. Poor sleepers exhibited significantly greater daytime behavioral problems and parents of children in this group reported significantly higher levels of stress. Above and beyond the co-occurring disruptive behavior, poor sleep quality appears to pose substantial additive burden on child and parents. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two series of glasses, the first with the formula (50-x/2)Na2O-xCaO-(50-x/2)P2O5 and an oxygen over phosphorus O/P ratio between 3 and 3.33 and the second with the composition (50-x)Na2O-xCaO-50P(2)O(5) with an O/ P = 3, were obtained by melt quenching and studied in order to understand the effects of the CaO addition on the structure, physical properties and thermochemistry of polyphosphate and metaphosphate glasses. The spectroscopic investigations by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and P-31 Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance indicate in the first series, the shortening of the polyphosphate chains as CaO content increases. The spectra of the second series indicate the conservation of the metaphosphate chains. The density and thermal analysis measurement show the shrinking and the reticulation of the phosphate network as CaO is added in both series and the chemical durability of the glasses is enhanced by the substitution of the P-O-Na and P-O-P-bonds by the P-O-Ca-bonds. The thermochemical study shows the decrease of the dissolution heat of the glasses when the average chain length decreases and when the chemical durability of the glass increases. The molar enthalpy of mixing indicates the presence of two ranges of interaction in the metaphosphate compositions around 0-20% and 25-50% of CaO.

AB Collective optical, FTIR and photoluminescence spectra of prepared (1 -> 10) CeO2 doped Na2O - ZnO - B2O3 glasses have been examined before and after gamma irradiation doses 2 or 9 x 104 Gy (2 or 9 Mrad). Optical absorption spectrum of undoped glass reveals distinct UV absorption bands which are correlated with trace impurities of ferric ions. Upon gamma irradiation, the UV bands reveal limited changes accompanied with the generation of an induced visible band which is assumed to be due to (BOHC) or (NBOHC). The CeO2 - doped glasses show an additional UV band due to Ce3+ ions while the absorption for Ce4+ ions are assumed to be overlapped by the strong charge transfer absorption due to traces impurities of Fe3+ ions. The irradiated CeO2 doped glasses reveal no induced visible band due to the efficiency of cerium ions to capture electrons and positive holes during the irradiation. The CeO2 - doped glasses show a distinct luminescence peak centered at 410 nm after excitation at 308 urn and its intensity increases with the CeO2. The optical parameters of the band gap energy and Urbach energy are found to change with the CeO2 content. FTIR spectra of the undoped and CeO2 - doped glasses are almost similar with minor variations in the intensities of some vibrational bands and they show vibrational modes due to both triangular and tetrahedral borate groups in their specific different wave numbers. The IR spectra of the irradiated glasses reveal stability with minor variations in the intensities of some bands.

AB Stone wool is a widely used material for building insulation, to provide thermal comfort along with fire stability and acoustic comfort for all types of buildings. Stone wool waste generated either during production or during renovation or demolition of buildings can be recycled back into the stone wool melt production. This study investigates and compares the thermal response and melting behaviour of a conventional stone wool charge and stone wool waste. The study combines differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), hot stage microscopy (HSM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). DSC reveals that the conventional charge and stone wool waste have fundamentally different thermal responses, where the charge experiences gas release, phase transition and melting of the individual raw materials. The stone wool waste experiences glass transition, crystallization and finally melting. Both DSC and HSM measurements indicates that the wool waste initiates melting at a lower temperature than the conventional charge. Also DSC measurements show that the wool waste requires less energy for heating and melting than the conventional charge, making stone wool waste recycling desirable both for environmental and for process purposes.

AB Series of five samples, named calcium bismuth niobium Borate glasses, were prepared by quenching their melts. The batches of all samples formed according to the chemical formula 60 mol% B2O3 - 20 mol% CaO - 20 mol% Bi2O3 (20 - x) Nb2O5 mol%, where x = 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 1 mol%. XRD, FTIR and UV vis. Were used to characterize the internal structure of these glasses. Both XRD and FTIR showed the amorphous character for all samples. FTIR showed that all Nb5+ ions occupied some interstitial vacancies, as a glass network modifiers (GNM), while some of Bi-3 ions share in the glass matrix, as a glass network formers (GNF) and some other occupied some other interstitial vacancies (GNM). The BO4 was found to increase by replacing Bi2O3 by Nb2O5, in other word, increase of the non-bridging oxygen atoms. For all samples, UV vis. exhibited two indirect (gamma = 1/2) and direct (gamma = 2) electronic transitions. Both the optical band gap and refractive index for direct transition case were found to have slightly increase as x increase. The density of the studied samples was found to be inversely proportional to their molar volume.

AB In the present research work silver nanoparticles embedded soda lime glass nanocomposites were fabricated by Ag+-Na+ ion-exchange technique followed by 200 keV Ar+ ion implantation at normal incidence with fluence of 1 x 10(15), 1 x 10(16), 5 x 10(16) and 1 x 10(17) ions cm(-2). Modifications induced in sample morphology were investigated using field-emission electron microscopy (FE-SEM) while energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX) spectroscopy was used for compositional analysis. UV-visible spectroscopy was utilized to carry out a comprehensive optical analysis of these nanocomposites so as to estimate some of the useful optical parameters like optical energy gap (E-g), Urbach's energy (E-u), refractive index (n), real (epsilon(1)) and imaginary (epsilon(2)) parts of dielectric function, skin depth and optical conductivity. Appearance of a narrow band in the transmission spectra around 342 nm in UV region for the nanocomposites synthesised with the doses of 1 x 10(16), 5 x 10(16) and 1 x 10(17) Ar+ ions cm-2 can be of significant importance as UV based narrow band pass filters. The optical energy gap of virgin soda lime glass decreased from the value of 3.65 eV to 3.30 eV for silver nanoparticles embedded soda lime glass nanocomposite with a dose of 1 x 10(17) Ar+ ions cm(-2) whereas Urbach's energy showed an increase from 0.19 eV for virgin soda lime glass to 1.09 eV for the same sample. Similarly, refractive index increased from the value of 1.51 for virgin glass to the value of 1.83 for the sample with 1 x 10(17) Ar+ ions cm(-2) at 500 rim. In addition to these optical parameters, dispersion behavior of refractive index of thus formed nanocomposites has also been studied on the basis of single-effective-oscillator model put forward by Wemple and DiDomenico.

AB The equilibrium viscosity and the specific heat capacity of three lead silicate glass forming liquids (flint glasses) with low glass transition temperatures are experimentally measured and compared to the thermophysical properties of network glass-formers like SiO2 and GeO2 and of bulk metallic glasses. The data are analyzed using the Vogel-Fulcher-Tarnmann (VFT) equation, the Mauro-Yue-Ellison-Gupta-Allan (MYEGA) equation, and the Adam-Gibbs approach. The flint glasses depart from the Arrhenius equation in terms of liquid kinetics and their corresponding kinetic fragilities are intermediate between GeO2 and the bulk metallic glass-formers. Among the lead silicates the fragility increases with increasing content of network modifiers, as lead, sodium and potassium modify the silicate network by creating non-bridging oxygen that softens the network.

AB Room-temperature rolling experiments were performed on Pd40Ni40R20 bulk metallic glass at two different strain rates. It is found that at each strain rate the shear band density increases with increasing strain for the deformed samples. However, for samples endured the same deformation strain, more amounts of shear bands (i.e., a higher shear band density) was introduced into the sample deformed at the higher strain rate. In addition, the higher strain rate also leads to the generation of more amount of free volume for samples endured a same deformation strain. The hardness change behavior investigation result suggests that the introduction of multiple intersected shear bands leads to hardening of Pd40Ni40P20 bulk metallic glass.

AB Loess is a product of aeolian deposition during Quaternary glaciation cycles. Loess-paleosol sequences are rich in calcareous nodules (CNs). in the literature, two models are widely cited for the formation of CNs, namely "per descendum" and "per ascendum". However, there has been no direct testing or monitoring to support either of these contradictory models. This paper reviews a large number of multidisciplinary literature to evaluate the consistency, reliability and rationality of these two models. Three main conclusions are drawn: (1) the causative factors (variation of pH value along loess-paleosol sequence, decrease of CO2 partial pressure, and reduction of solvent water) that are used to support the per descendum model do not completely explain the supersaturation of infiltration solution with CaCO3, thereby making this model questionable; (2) the per ascendum model explains the formation of CNs along narrow horizons through upward evaporation; however, it fails to produce sporadic distributions and irregular shapes of nodules on loess slope faces and the frequent appearance of nodules around plant roots. In order to reconcile these deficiencies, we conducted an extensive field survey in various parts of Shanxi province. Based on this new set of observations, it was concluded that the "per ascendum" model can be extended to explain all occurrences of CNs. This extended model is called "per evapotranspiration".

AB This paper presents relatively high-resolution geochemical records spanning the past 4000 cal yr BP obtained from the lacustrine sediments of Poyang Lake in central China. The variations in the intensity of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) are traced using the K/Na, Ti/Na, Al/K, kaolinite/illite and clay/feldspar ratios, together with the chemical index of alteration (CIA), as indicators of chemical weathering. During the last 4000 years, the proxy records of chemical weathering from Poyang Lake exhibit an overall enhanced trend, consistent with regional hydrological changes in previous independent records. Further comparisons and analyses demonstrate that regional moisture variations in central China is inversely correlated with the EASM intensity, with weak EASM generating high precipitation in central China. Our data reveal three intervals of dramatically dry climatic conditions (i.e., ca. 4000-3200 cal yr BP, ca. 2800-2400 cal yr BP, and ca. 500-200 cal yr BP). A period of weak chemical weathering, related to cold and dry climatic conditions, occurred during the Little Ice Age (LIA), whereas more intense chemical weathering, reflecting warm and humid climatic conditions, was recorded during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). Besides, an intensification of chemical weathering in Poyang Lake during the late Holocene agrees well with strong ENSO activity, suggesting that moisture variations in central China may be predominantly driven by ENSO variability.

AB Spatial variation of seismic b-value is estimated in the Indo-Myanmar subduction zone of northeast (NE) India using the homogeneous part of earthquake catalogue (1996-2015), recorded by International Seismological Center (ISC), consisting of 895 events of magnitude M-w >= 3.9. The study region is divided into 1 degrees x 1 degrees square grids and b-values are estimated at each grid by maximum likelihood method. In this study, the b-value varies from 0.75 to 1.54 in the region. Significant variation of low b-value in the respective location may indicate high stress accumulation in that region. Spatial variation reveals intermediate b-value anomalies around the epicenter of the M-w = 6/Manipur earthquake which occurred on 3rd January at 23:05 UTC (4 January 2016 at 04:35 IST). The variations of b-values are also estimated with respect to depth. The low b-value associated with the depth range similar to 15-55 km, which may imply crustal homogeneity and high stress accumulation in the crust. Since, NE India lies in the seismic zone V of the country; this study can be helpful to understand seismotectonics in the region.

TI Inversion of the Erlian Basin (NE China) in the early Late Cretaceous:

AB A significant transition in tectonic regime from extension to compression occurred throughout East Asia during the mid-Cretaceous and has stimulated much attention. However, the timing and driving mechanisms of the transition remain disputed. The Erlian Basin, a giant late Mesozoic intracontinental petroliferous basin located in the Inner Mongolia, Northeast China, contains important sedimentary and structural records related to the mid Cretaceous compressional event. The stratigraphical, sedimentological and structural analyses reveal that a NW-SE compressional inversion occurred in the Erlian Basin between the depositions of the Lower Cretaceous Saihan and Upper Cretaceous Erlian formations, causing intense folding of the Saihan Formation and underlying strata, and the northwestward migration of the depocenters of the Erlian Formation. Based on the newly obtained detrital zircon U-Pb data and previously published paleomagnetism-and fossil-based ages, the Saihan and Erlian formations are suggested as latest Aptian-Albian and post-early Cenomanian in age, respectively, implying that the inversion in the Erlian Basin occurred in the early Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian time). Apatite fission-track thermochronological data record an early Late Cretaceous cooling/exhuming event in the basin, corresponding well with the aforementioned sedimentary, structural and chronological analyses, Combining with the tectono-sedimentary evolutions of the neighboring basins of the Erlian Basin, we suggest that the early Late Cretaceous inversional event in the Erlian Basin and the large scale tectonic transition in East Asia shared the common driving mechanism, probably resulting from the Okhotomorsk Block-East Asia collisional event at about 100-89 Ma.

TI Density contrast across the Moho beneath the Indian shield: Implications
   for isostasy

AB Knowledge of isostasy provides insights into how excess (or deficit) of mass on and within the lithosphere is maintained over different time scales, and also helps decipher the vertical dynamics. In continental regions, isostasy is primarily manifested as a crustal root, the extent of which is defined by the lithospheric strength and the density contrast at the Moho. In this study, we briefly review the methodology for extracting the density contrast across the Moho using the amplitudes of the P-to-s converted and free-surface reverberating phases in a receiver function (RF). We test the efficacy of this technique by applying it on synthetic and real data from 10 broadband seismic stations sited on diverse tectonic provinces in the Indian shield. We determine the density contrast after parameterizing the shear-wave velocity structure beneath the stations using the nearest neighbourhood algorithm. We find considerable variation in the density contrast across the Moho beneath the stations (0.4-0.65 gm/cc). This is explained in terms of isostatic compensation, incorporating the existing estimates of lithospheric strength (Te). Crustal roots computed using the estimated Te and the deduced density contrast substantiate the crustal thickness values inferred through RF analysis, and vice versa. This illustrates isostasy as a combination of variation in density contrast and Te. The density contrasts and crustal thicknesses inferred from RF analysis explain well the isostatic compensation mechanism in different regions. However, unusually large density contrasts (similar to 0.6 gm/cc) corresponding to elevated regions are intriguing and warrant further investigations. Our observation of varied density contrasts at the Moho in a Precambrian continental setting is interesting and raises a question about the existence of such situations in other parts of the world.

AB A detailed environmental magnetic investigation has been performed on a sub-alpine sedimentary succession deposited over the past 15,400 years in Daping Swamp in the western Nanling Mountains of South China. Magnetic parameters reveal that fine grains of pseudo-single domain (PSD) magnetite or titanomagnetite are the dominant magnetic minerals in the lake sediments and surface soils collected from the catchment, which suggests that magnetic minerals in lake sediments mainly originated from surface soil erosion of the catchment. Variation of surface runoff caused by rainfall is interpreted as the main process for transportation of weathered soils into the lake. In the Last Deglacial period (LGP, 15,400-11,500 cal a BP), the influx of magnetic minerals of detrital material may have been significantly affected by the severe dry and cold conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum. Stabilised conditions of the catchment associated with increased vegetation coverage (e.g., 8000-4500 and 2500-1000 cal a BP) limited the input of magnetic minerals. Intensive soil erosion caused by increased human activity may have given rise to abnormal increases in multiple magnetic parameters after 1000 cal a BP. Because changes in runoff and vegetation coverage are closely related to Asian summer monsoon (ASM) intensity, the sedimentary magnetism of Daping Swamp provides another source of information to investigate the evolution of the ASM.

AB In this study, we compiled recently collected (from 2005 to 2015) and previously reported (published and open access) gravity data, including land, shipborne and satellite-derived data, for Taiwan and its surrounding regions. Based on the cross-over error analysis, all data were adjusted; and, new Free-air gravity anomalies were obtained, shedding light on the tectonics of the region. To obtain the Bouguer gravity anomalies, the densities of land terrain and marine sediments were assumed to be 2.53 and 1.80 g/cm(3), respectively. The updated gravity dataset was gridded with a spacing of one arc-minute. Several previously unnoticed gravity features are revealed by the new maps and can be used in a broad range of applications: (1) An isolated gravity high is located between the Shoushan and the Kaoping Canyon off southwest Taiwan. (2) Along the Luzon Arc, both Free-air and Bouguer gravity anomaly maps reveal a significant gravity discontinuity feature at the latitude of 21 degrees 20'N. (3) In the southwestern Okinawa Trough, the NE-SW trending cross-back-arc volcanic trail (CBVT) marks the low-high gravity anomaly (both Free-air and Bouguer) boundary.

AB The west to southwestward motion of the Anatolian block results from the relative motions between the Eurasian, Arabian and African plates along the right-lateral North Anatolian Fault Zone in the north and left lateral East Anatolian Fault Zone in the east. The Biga Peninsula is tectonically influenced by the Anatolian motion originating along the North Anatolian Fault Zone which splits into two main (northern and southern) branches in the east of Marmara region: the southern branch extends towards the Biga Peninsula which is characterized by strike-slip to oblique normal faulting stress regime in the central to northern part. The southernmost part of peninsula is characterized by a normal to oblique faulting stress regime. The analysis of both seismological and structural field data confirms the change of stress regime from strike-slip character in the center and north to normal faulting character in the south of peninsula where the earthquake swarm recently occurred. The earthquakes began on 14 January 2017 (Mw: 4.4) on Tuzla Fault and migrated southward along the Kocakoy and Babakale's stepped-normal faults of over three months. The inversion of focal mechanisms yields a normal faulting stress regime with an approximately N-S (N4 degrees E) sigma 3 axis. The inversion of earthquakes occurring in central and northern Biga Peninsula and the north Aegean region gives a strike-slip stress regime with approximately WNW-ESE (N85 degrees W) sigma 1 and NNE-SSW (N17 degrees E) sigma 3 axis. The strike-slip stress regime is attributed to westward Anatolian motion, while the normal faulting stress regime is attributed to both the extrusion of Anatolian block and the slab-pull force of the subducting African plate along the Hellenic arc.

   CONSTRAINTS
AB Archean Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite (TTG) rocks are scattered within the Kongling high-grade metamorphic terrane (KHMT) in the northern South China block. A comprehensive geochronological and geochemical study is carried out on the Taoyuan granitic gneisses, a newly recognized TTG suite in the northwestern KHMT. This suite has long been regarded as a Mesoproterozoic magmatic pluton, but U-Pb zircon ages of 2994 +/- 22 Ma and 2970 +/- 15 Ma are obtained by LA-ICP-MS method in this study. The Taoyuan gneiss suite is trondhjemitic in composition, and has high SiO2 (67.80-74.93 wt.%), Na2O (5.11-5.81 wt.%) contents with Na2O/K2O ratios greater than unity, and low Ni (2.56-7.61 ppm), Cr (1.26-7.67 ppm), Yb (0.32-0.82 ppm) and Y (4.48-11.5 ppm) contents. Plots show large variation in La/Yb and Sr/Y ratios and pronounced depletion in Nb, Ta and Ti in the primitive mantle-normalized spiderdiagram. The gneiss suite also displays two-stage Nd model ages close to its crystallization age with corresponding epsilon(Nd)(t) values of -2.5 to + 3.5. It is dins suggested that the Taoyuan gneisses, in fact, is part of the Archean Kongling basement complex.
   Geochemical evidence implies that the TTG rocks may be derived from partial melting of subducted oceanic crust from a gametiferous amphibolite source with residual assemblage of garnet + amphibole + plagioclase. Our study further indicates that the nucleus of the Yangtze block might experience a juvenile continental crustal growth during Mesoarchean. We also suggest that the Yangtze block may have its own crustal evolutionary history independent from the North China craton and the Tarim block before Paleoproterozoic.

AB Magmatic Ni-Cu-(PGE) sulfide deposits in the ca. 260-Ma Emeishan large igneous province (LIP) are all hosted in relatively small, mafic-ultramafic intrusions with surface areas usually less than 1 km(2). These deposits are mainly distributed in the Danba, Panzhihua-Xichang (Panxi), Huili, Yuanmou, Midu, Furling and Jinping regions in SW China and the Ta Khoa region in northern Vietnam. They include Ni-Cu-(PGE) sulfide-dominated, Ni-Cu sulfide dominated, and PGE-dominated types. Sulfide ores of the Ni-Cu-(PGE) and Ni-Cu sulfide-dominated deposits contain more than 10 vol% sulfides and have low PGE concentrations relative to the ores that contain < 3 vol% sulfides in the PGE-dominated deposits. The parental magmas of the host mafic-ultramafic intrusions may have been derived primarily from low-Ti picritic magmas that were produced by high degrees of partial melting of a depleted mantle source. The primary low-Ti picrites of the Emeishan LIP have relatively restricted epsilon Nd(t) and gamma Os(t) isotopic compositions, however, some of the host intrusions exhibit a large range of both epsilon Nd(t) (-9.5 to + 0.8) and gamma Os(t) (+ 5.4 to +77), indicating that they experienced variable degrees of crustal contamination during emplacement. In addition, sulfides from sulfide ores of the Ban Phuc intrusion in northern Vietnam and those from sulfide veins in country rocks have delta S-34 values ranging from -6.7 to -3.4 parts per thousand, whereas sulfides from sulfide ores of the Baimazhai No.3, Yingpanjie, Jinbaoshan and Nantianwan intrusions in SW China have highly variable delta S-34 ranging from -0.2 to +21.4 parts per thousand, indicating the addition of crustal sulfur into the mantle-derived mafic magmas. Platinum-group minerals (PGM) are abundant in the Ni-Cu-(PGE) sulfide-bearing intrusions, and they span a wide range of composition. More than 130 PGM grains have been identified in the Pt-Pd-rich Jinbaoshan intrusion, whereas only one small finodite (PdBi2) grain was observed in the Ni-Cu sulfide-dominated Baimazhai No. 3 intrusion. Overall, the three types of Ni-Cu-(PGE) sulfide deposits in the Emeishan LIP can be taken as a spectrum of Ni-Cu-(PGE) sulfide mineralization, the formation of which involved similar magmatic processes in open systems of magma conduits. The magma conduits developed along the cross-linking structures created by numerous strike-slip faults and each intrusion appears to be part of a connecting trellis of conduits that formed complex pathways from the mantle to the surface. The Ni-Cu sulfide-dominated deposits are attributed to a single sulfide segregation event in staging magma chambers, whereas the PGE-dominated deposits were likely formed by a multistage-dissolution, upgrading process in the staging chambers. The Ni-Cu-(PGE) sulfide-dominated deposits may have experienced interaction between successive pulses of S-undersaturated mafic magma and early segregated sulfide melts in the staging chambers. This study is intended to provide a better understanding of the magmatic processes related to the formation of conduit-type Ni-Cu-(PGE) sulfide deposits associated with continental flood basalt magmatism.

AB Lu-Hf isotopic system in zircon is a powerful and widely used geochemical tracer in studying petrogenesis of magmatic rocks and crustal evolution, assuming that zircon Hf isotopes can represent initial Hf isotopes of their parental whole rock. However, this assumption may not always be valid. Disequilibrium partial melting of continental crust would preferentially melt out non-zircon minerals with high time-integrated Lu/Hf ratios and generate partial melts with Hf isotope compositions that are more radiogenic than those of its magma source. Dissolution experiments (with hotplate, bomb and sintering procedures) of zircon-bearing samples demonstrate this disequilibrium effect where partial dissolution yielded variable and more radiogenic Hf isotope compositions than fully dissolved samples. A case study from the Neoproterozoic Jiuling batholith in southern China shows that about half of the investigated samples show decoupled Hf isotopes between zircons and the bulk rocks. This decoupling could reflect complex and prolonged magmatic processes, such as crustal assimilation, magma mixing, and disequilibrium melting, which are consistent with the wide temperature spectrum from similar to 630 degrees C to similar to 900 degrees C by Ti-in-zircon thermometer. We suggest that magmatic zircons may only record the Hf isotopic composition of their surrounding melt during crystallization and it is uncertain whether their Hf isotopic compositions can represent the primary Hf isotopic compositions of the bulk magmas. In this regard, using zircon Hf isotopic compositions to trace crustal evolution may be biased since most of these could be originally from disequilibrium partial melts.

TI 3D seismic investigation of the structural and stratigraphic

AB The Pagasa Wedge is a poorly imaged deepwater orogenic wedge that has been variously interpreted as representing an accretionary prism, a former accretionary prism modified by thrusting onto a thinned continental margin, and a gravity-driven fold-thrust belt. This study, using 2D and 3D seismic data, together with well information indicates that at least the external part of the wedge is dominantly composed of mass transport complexes, capped by syn-kinematic sediments that have thrusts and normal faults superimposed upon them. Drilling shows that despite stratigraphic repetition of Eocene Middle Miocene units, there is stratigraphic omission of Oligocene and Early Miocene units. This absence suggests that mass transport processes have introduced the Eocene section into the wedge rather than tectonic thrusting. The accretionary prism stage (Oligocene) of the Central Palawan Ophiolite history appears to be marked by predominantly north-vergent deformation. The Deep Regional Unconformity (similar to 17 Ma) likely indicates the approximate time when obduction ceased in Palawan. The Pagasa Wedge is a late-stage product of the convergence history that was active in its final phase sometime above the top of the Nido Limestone (similar to 16 Ma) and the base of the Tabon Limestone in the Aboabo-A1X well (similar to 9 Ma). The top of the wedge is traditionally associated with the Middle Miocene Unconformity (MMU), However the presence of multiple unconformities, diachronous formation tops, local tectonic unconformities and regional diachronous events (e.g. migrating forebulges) all suggest simply giving a single age (or assigning a single unconformity, such as the MMU as defining the top of the Pagasa Wedge is inappropriate. The overall NE-SW trend of the wedge, and the dominant NW transport of structures within the wedge diverge from the more northerly transport direction determined from outcrops in Palawan, and also from the Nido Limestone in the SW part of the Pagasa Wedge. Possibly this NW transport direction is more related to gravity-driven structures responding to uplift of NE-SW Dangerous Grounds margin during the Middle Miocene (related to slab breakoff?) than it is to thrusting rooted in a plate boundary. The final modification of the wedge occurred when the effects of compression deformation on the wedge had largely ended, but gravity processes (in particular mass transport and normal faulting) still operated.

AB The crust and upper mantle shear wave velocity structure beneath the northeast India is estimated by joint inversion of Rayleigh wave group velocity and receiver function, calculated from teleseismic earthquakes data recorded at nine broadband seismic stations. The Assam valley and the Shillong-Mikir plateau are the two important tectonic blocks in the northeast India, which are surrounded by the Himalayan collision zone in the north, Indo-Burma subduction zone in the east and by the Bengal basin in the south. The joint inversion followed by forward modeling reveal crustal thicknesses of 30-34 km beneath the Shillong plateau, 36 km beneath the Mikir hills and 38-40 km beneath the Assam valley with an average shear wave velocity (Vs) of 3.4-3.5 km/s. The estimated low upper mantle shear wave velocity (Vsn) 4.2-4.3 km/s may be due to the rock composition or grain size or increased temperature and partial melt (< 1%) in the upper mantle, or an effect of all. Also, we report for the first time, the existence of the Hales discontinuity at depths 56-74 km with Vs similar to 4.4-4.6 km/s. Variable depth of the Hales discontinuity may be explained by the geotherm and/or addition of Cr3+ and Fe2+ in the spinel-garnet system.

AB Marginal seas are important transitional zones for the delivery of terrestrial organic matter (TOM) from land to the open sea, and they play an important role in the carbon cycle. Tracing the source of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) deposited in marginal seas is fundamental to our understanding of the dispersal, degradation, migration, and conversion of organic matter. This paper presents high-resolution records of bulk organic matter and biomarker proxies from Core T08 that was recovered from the inner shelf of the East China Sea (ECS), and aims to identify the contributions of marine and terrestrial organic matter over the past 3725 yrs. Total organic carbon (TOC) values were low (0.50%) and showed no significant change between 3725 and 1800 yr BP (Period I), and increased continuously from 0.40% to 0.86% after 1800 yr BP (Period II: 1800-750 yr BP; Period III: 750 yr BP present). The TMBR' (ratio of terrestrial to marine biomarkers) and delta C-13(roc) (delta C-13 of TOC) values showed steady TOM contribution during Period I and higher TOM contribution driven by the increased Changjiang River (CR)-derived TOM under strong East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) and El Nino during Period II. During Period III, the increase in marine organic matter (MOM) contribution was indicated by the TMBR', and this was caused by enhanced marine productivity related to intensified vertical mixture that was driven by the strengthened East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM). delta(CTroc)-C-13 shows a contrary trend to the TMBR' during Period III, probably influenced by variations in the C-3 vegetation type during this period. Spectral analysis of the TMBR' series for the last 1200 yrs shows cycles with periods of 119, 75-85, and 54 yrs, confirming that climate-related events influenced the variation in SOM under the modulation of solar activity and solar irradiance at the centennial scale.

AB Mafic granulites in the Fuping Complex occur as lenses or boudins within high-grade TTG (Trondhjemite-Tonalite-Granodiorite) gneisses. Petrographic observations reveal four generations of mineral assemblage in the granulites: an inclusion assemblage of hornblende + plagioclase + ihnenite + quartz within garnet core; an inferred peak assemblage composed of garnet hornblende + plagioclase + clinopyroxene + menite + quartz; a decompression assemblage characterized by symplectites of clinopyroxene orthopyroxene + plagioclase, coronae of plagioclase +/- clinopyroxene +/- hornblende around embayed garnet porphyroblasts or a two-pyroxene association; and a late amphibolite-facies retrogressive assemblage. Two representative samples were used for pseudosection modeling in NCFMASHTO model system to determine their metamorphic evolution. The results show that these granulites experienced a high-pressure stage of metamorphism with peak P-T conditions of 12-13 kbar and 760-800 degrees C (P-max) and a post -peak history under P-T conditions of similar to 9.0 kbar and 805-835 degrees C (T-max), indicating a nearly isothermal decompression process (ITD) with a slight heating. Metamorphic evolution from the P-max to the T-max is predicted to be dominated by garnet breakdown through continuous metamorphic reactions of garnet + quartz +/- diopside = hornblende + plagioclase + liquid and garnet + quartz + homblende = plagioclase + diopside + liquid + orthopyroxene. Further metamorphic evolution after the T-max is dominated by cooling, suggesting that high-pressure (HP) granulites may also exist in the Fuping Complex. Metamorphic zircons in the Fuping HP mafic granulites have left inclined REE patterns, Ti contents of 1.68-6.88 ppm and crystallization temperatures of 602-712 degrees C. SIMS zircon U-Pb dating on these zircons yields Pb-207/Pb-206 ages of 1891 +/- 14 Ma and 1849 +/- 6 Ma, interpreted to represent the cooling stage of metamorphism. The P-T-t evolution of the Fuping HP mafic granulites records well the protracted Paleoproterozoic orogenic event occurred in the central North China Craton.

AB Malan loess is a grayish yellow or brownish yellow, elastic, highly porous and brittle late Quaternary sediment formed by the accumulation of windblown dust. The present-day pore structure of Malan loess is crucial for understanding the loessification process in history, loess strengths and mechanical behavior. This study employed a modern computed tomography (CT) device to scan Malan loess samples, which were obtained from the east part of the Loess Plateau of China. A sophisticated and efficient workflow for processing the CT images and constructing 3D pore models was established by selecting and programming relevant mathematical algorithms in MATLAB, such as the maximum entropy method, medial axis method, and node recognition algorithm. Individual pipes within the Malan loess were identified and constructed by partitioning and recombining links in the 3D pore model. The macropore structure of Malan loess was then depicted using quantitative parameters. The parameters derived from 2D images of CT scanning included equivalent radius, length and aspect ratio of pores, porosity, and pore distribution entropy, whereas those derived from the constructed 3D structure models included porosity, coordination number, node density, pipe radius, length, length density, dip angle, and dip direction. The analysis of these parameters revealed that Malan loess is a strongly anisotropic geomaterial with a dense and complex network of pores and pipes. The pores discovered on horizontal images, perpendicular to the vertical direction, were round and relatively uniform in shape and size and evenly distributed, whereas the pores discovered on vertical images varied in shape and size and were distributed in clusters. The pores showed good connectivity in vertical direction and formed vertically aligned pipes but displayed weak connectivity in horizontal directions. The pipes in vertical direction were thick, long, and straight compared with those in horizontal directions. These results were in good agreement with both numerical simulation and laboratory permeability tests, which indicate that Malan loess is more permeable in the vertical direction than in the horizontal directions.

AB In the western margin of the Yangtze Block, SW China, the Emeishan large igneous province (ELIP) is spatially associated with > 400 carbonate-hosted epigenetic Pb-Zn deposits. These deposits form the giant Upper Yangtze Pb-Zn metallogenic province with > 20 Mt base metals. In the southeastern part of this province, the important Pb-Zn deposits include those of the Yinchangpo, Yunluhe, Maozhachang, Tianqiao, Banbanqiao, Mangdong, Shaojiwan, Liangyan, Qingshan, Shanshulin, Nayongzhi and Guanziyao deposits. Sulfide ore bodies in these deposits are (i) hosted in late Ediacaran to middle Permian limestone, dolomitic limestone and dolostone; (ii) structurally controlled by reverse fault-anticline tectonic systems; and (iii) spatially associated with the ELIP flood basalts and mafic dikes, and early Permian, early Carboniferous and early Cambrian organic matter-rich black shales. C-O isotopic compositions suggest that dolostone and limestone, mantle-derived rocks of the ELIP, and sedimentary organic matters supplied C-O to the hydrothermal systems through water/rock (W/R) interaction. New and existing S isotopic compositions of sulfides imply multiple sources of S and the reduction of sulfate through both abiotic thermochemical (TSR) and bacterially mediated (BSR) processes. Zn isotopes indicate that the sources of Zn were most likely related to the ELT with various contributions from sediments and basements locally. Pb isotope signatures are suggestive of derivation of Pb from basements and sedimentary rocks with variable influences from the ELIP. Sr isotopes support that mantle-derived rocks, sediments and basements were involved in Pb-Zn mineralization, and they have various contributions in different deposits. We consider that the Pb-Zn deposits in the Upper Yangtze province are the mixed products of multiple S species bearing solutions and metal-rich fluids, both of which were derived from, flowed through or interacted with multiple lithostratigraphic units in the western Yangtze Block. The change of tectonic regimes from extension to compression after eruption of basalts of the ELT, and then to extension during Early Mesozoic, facilitated extraction, migration, and excretion of ore-forming metals and associated fluids. Mixing of fluids and reduction geochemical barrier activated TSR, causing cyclical carbonate dissolution, CO2 degassing and recrystallization (namely carbonate buffer). All these processes triggered continuous precipitation of huge amounts of hydro thermal minerals. Underplating and eruption of ELT basalts provided heat flow, fluids and volatiles, whereas the basalts acted as an impermeable and protective layer, and even as ore-hosting rocks. These Pb-Zn deposits have spatial and genetic association with igneous activities of the ELIP, and are characterized by high ore grades ( > 10 wt% Pb + Zn), high concentrations of associated metals (e.g. Cu, Ag, Ge, and Cd), and medium-low temperatures (usually < 300 degrees C) and salinities (commonly < 20 wt% NaCl equiv.), all of which are significantly different from those of typical Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) deposits. Hence, the carbonate-hosted epigenetic Pb-Zn deposits in the Upper Yangtze metallogenic province representing to a new type of Pb-Zn deposits that are hosted in platform carbonate sequences and formed within compressional zones of passive margin tectonic settings.

AB Detrital framework modes of the NE Gondwanan uppermost Ediacaran-Lower Cretaceous siliciclastic sequence of Jordan are determined employing the routine polarized light microscope. The lower part of this sequence constitutes a segment of the vast lower Paleozoic siliciclastic sheet flanking the northern Gondwana margin that was deposited over a regional unconformity truncating the outskirts of the East African orogen in the aftermath of the Neoproterozoic amalgamation of Gondwana. The research aims to evaluate the factors governing the detrital light mineral composition of this sandstone. The provenance terranes of the Arabian craton controlled by plate tectonics appear to be the primary factor in most of the formations, which could be either directly inferred employing Dickinson's compositional triangles or implied utilizing the petrographic data achieved and the available tectonic and geological data. The Arabian-Nubian Shield constitutes invariably the craton interior or the transitional provenance terrane within the NE Gondwana continental block that consistently supplied sandy detritus through northward-flowing braided rivers to all the lower Paleozoic formations. On the other hand, the Lower Cretaceous Series received siliciclastic debris, through braided-meandering rivers having same northward dispersal direction, additionally from the lower Paleozoic and lower-middle Mesozoic platform strata in the Arabian Craton. The formations making about 50% of the siliciclastic sequence represent a success for Dickinson's plate tectonics-provenance approach in attributing the detrital framework components primarily to the plate tectonic setting of the provenance terranes. However, even under this success, the varying effects of the other secondary sedimentological and paleoclimatological factors are important and could be crucial. The inapplicability of this approach to infer the appropriate provenance terranes of the remaining formations could be ascribed either to the special influence of local intracratonic syn-rift rhyolitic extrusions, where their plate tectonic setting is not represented by the standard plate tectonics-provenance diagrams, or to the rather unusual effect of the Late Ordovician glacial event.

AB Understanding processes of magma replenishment in a magma plumbing system is essential to predict eruption potential of a dormant volcano. In this study, we present new petrologic and thermobarometric data for youngest lava flows from the Holocene Heikongshan volcano in the Tengchong area, SW China. Clinopyroxene phenocrysts from the trachytic lava flows display various textural/compositional zoning styles (i.e., normal, reverse and oscillatory). Such zoning patterns are indicative of an open magmatic plumbing system with multiphase magma replenishment and mixing, which were likely a key drive of the volcanic eruptions. Thermobarometric calculations of these zoned clinopyroxene phenocrysts yield crystallization pressures of 3.8-7.1 kbar (peak at 4.5-7.0 kbar), corresponding to a magma chamber at depths of 14-21 km. The calculated depths are consistent with the large low-resistivity body at 12-30 km beneath the Heikongshan volcano, implying that the magmatic plumbing system may still be active. Recent earthquakes in the Tengchong area suggest that the regional strike slip faulting are still active, and may trigger future volcanic eruptions if the magma chamber(s) beneath the Tengchong volcanic field is disturbed, in spite of the volcanic quiescence since 1609 CE.

AB The Paleoproterozoic Seligdar magnesiocarbonatite intrusion of the Aldan-Stanovoy shield in Russia underwent extensive postmagmatic hydrothermal alteration and metamorphic events. This study comprises new isotopic (Sr, Nd, C and O) data, whole-rock major and trace element compositions and trace element characteristics of the major minerals to gain a better understanding of the source and the formation process of the carbonatites. The Seligdar carbonatites have high concentrations of P2O5 (up to 18 wt%) and low concentrations of Na, K, Sr and Ba. The chondrite-normalized REE patterns of these carbonatites display significant enrichments of LREE relative to HREE with an average La/Ybcn ratio of 95. Hydrothermal and metamorphic overprints changed the trace element characteristics of the carbonatites and their minerals. These alteration processes were responsible for Sr loss and the shifting of the Sr isotopic compositions towards more radiogenic values. The altered carbonatites are further characterized by distinct O-18- and C-13-enrichments compared to the primary igneous carbonatites. The alteration most likely resulted from both the percolation of crustal-derived hydrothermal fluids and subsequent metamorphic processes accompanied by interaction with limestone-derived CO2. The narrow range of negative epsilon Nd(T) values indicates that the Seligdar carbonatites are dominated by a homogenous enriched mantle source component that was separated from the depleted mantle during the Archean.

AB We herein report the coupling of a nanosecond laser ablation system with a large-scale multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (Nu1700 MC-ICPMS, NP-1700) and a conventional Nu Plasma II MC-ICPMS (NP-II) for the simultaneous laser ablation and determination of in situ S and Pb isotopic compositions of sulfide minerals. We found that the required aerosol distribution between the two spectrometers depended on the Pb content of the sample. For example, for a sulfide containing 100-3000 ppm Pb, the aerosol was distributed between the NP-1700 and the NP-II spectrometers in a 1:1 ratio, while for lead contents > 3000 and < 100 ppm, these ratios were 5:1 and 1:3, respectively. In addition, S isotopic analysis showed a pronounced matrix effect, so a matrix-matched external standard was used for standard-sample bracketing correction. The NIST NBS 977 (NBS, National Bureau of Standards; NIST, National Institute of Standards & Technology) Tl (thallium) dry aerosol internal standard and the NIST SRM 610 (SRM, standard reference material) external standard were employed to obtain accurate results for the analysis of Pb isotopes. In tandem experiments where airflow conditions were similar to those employed during stand-alone analyses, small changes in the aerosol carrier gas flow did not significantly influence the accurate determination of S and Pb isotope ratios. In addition, careful optimization of the flow ratio of the aerosol carrier (He) and makeup (Ar) gases to match stand-alone analytical conditions allowed comparable S and Pb isotope ratios to be obtained within an error of 2 s analytical uncertainties. Furthermore, the results of tandem analyses obtained using our method were consistent with those of previously reported stand-alone techniques for the S and Pb isotopes of chalcopyrite, pyrite, galena, and sphalerite, thus indicating that this method is suitable for the simultaneous analysis of S and Pb isotopes of natural sulfide minerals, and provides an effective tool to determine S and Pb isotope compositions of sulfides formed through multi-stage deposition routes.

AB On 15 April 2016 a very strong and shallow earthquake (EQ) (M-W = 7.0, depth similar to 10 km) occurred in Southwest Japan under the city of Kumamoto, while two very strong foreshocks (M-W = 6.2 and M-W = 6.0) preceded by about one day. The Kumamoto EQs being very catastrophic, have already attracted much attention among the scientific community in a quest for understanding the generation mechanism, as well as for reporting any preseismic anomalies in various observables and assessing the effectivity of the current early warning systems. In the present article we report precursory behavior of the ground-based observed ultra-low frequency (ULF) magnetic field variations before the Kumamoto EQs. By analyzing specific ULF magnetic field characteristics in terms of the recently introduced natural time (NT) analysis method, we identified that ULF magnetic field variations presented critical features from 2 weeks up to 1 month before the Kumamoto EQs. Specifically, the ULF magnetic field characteristics F-h, F-z, D-h and delta Dep were analyzed. The first two represent variations of the horizontal and vertical components of the geomagnetic field. The third and fourth characteristics correspond to the depression (decrease) and a relative depression of the horizontal magnetic field variations, respectively. The latter depends on the degree of ionospheric disturbance. All of them were found to reach criticality before the Kumamoto EQs; however, in different time periods for each characteristic.

AB The aeolian loess blanketing the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) is sensitive to climate change in monsoonal East Asia. Here, we present a multi-proxy climatic record from a Pleistocene loess-paleosol sequence from the Lantian Basin on the southern margin of the CLP. The measurements include magnetic susceptibility and related magnetic properties, bulk median grain-size, color reflectance, and the color-inferred hematite versus goethite ratio (Hm/Gt). A long-term aridification and cooling trend during the interval from ca 2.22-0.43 Ma is indicated by two magnetic grain-size proxies, corresponding to the global climatic cooling of the late Cenozoic. In addition, at least four intervals of climatic extremes are evident in the record of Hm/Gt ratio: at 1.71-1.65 Ma, 1.26-1.24 Ma, 0.94-0.86 Ma, and 0.62-0.48 Ma. These intervals are characterized by distinct regional climates, which contrast with the global climatic conditions represented in marine sediments. For example, a relatively arid climate is documented from 1.71 to 1.65 Ma, which was rapidly succeeded by a relatively humid climate which is associated with the earliest hominin (with an age of ca 1.63 Ma) in the Lantian Basin.

AB In this study, a detailed rigorous theoretical model was developed to predict the transmembrane flux of a shell-and-tube type vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) module for seawater desalination. Two modes of operation are used for performing the VMD, namely lumen-side feed (in-out) configuration and shell-side feed (out-in) configuration. In this study, detailed mathematical formulations are derived for an out-in configuration that is commonly used in seawater desalination applications. Experimental results and model predictions for mean permeate flux are compared and shown to be in good agreement. The results indicate that although the simple VMD model that maintains a constant permeate pressure is easy to use, it is likely to significantly overestimate the mean permeate flux when compared to the detailed model that considers the pressure build-up in the fiber lumen. The pressure build-up of water vapor in the fiber lumen is identified as the crucial factor that significantly affects the VMD performance because it directly reduces the driving force for vapor permeation through the membrane pores. Additionally, its effect is more pronounced at longer fiber lengths and higher permeate fluxes, and this is achieved at higher feed temperatures and velocities and at lower feed salinities. In conclusion, the results of the study are extremely important in module design for the practical applications of VMD processes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Iron (Fe) plays a critical role in the formation of hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) which may participate in the indirect photodegradation of aquatic contaminants. While Fe photochemistry has been extensively studied, the efficacy of iron amendments for contaminant attenuation in sunlit natural waters has not been well researched. We studied the efficacy of this approach by monitoring center dot OH induced acetochlor (AC) degradation and determining center dot OH production rates with terephthalate (TPA) as a probe. Surface wetland waters as well as model fulvic acid (FA) solutions were amended with Fe-(III) salt at different concentrations at pH values of 2.7, 5, and 7.6. We observed no significant enhancement in the AC degradation rate at circumneutral pH. At pH 5, AC degradation increased by more than 50% with an Fe addition up to an [Fe](T) approximate to 6 mu M and plateaued at high [Fe](T). At the highly acidic pH of acid mine drainage (AMD) waters, AC degradation was enhanced by two-orders-of magnitude with increasing [Fe](T) and no plateau was observed under the conditions tested ([Fe](T) <= 500 mu M). While the Fe induced relative difference in center dot OH production rates determined using TPA was useful in elucidating the reaction mechanism for different dissolved organic matter types at different pH values, the absolute value of center dot OH production rates over-predicted the transformation of AC suggesting the existence of unknown side reactions and/or alternative reactive intermediates.

AB The aim of this study was to understand the uncertainty of estimating loads for observed herbicides and nutrients during a flood event and provide guidance on estimator selection. A high-resolution grab sampling campaign (258 samples over 100 h) was conducted during a flood event in a tropical waterway in Queensland, Australia. Ten herbicides and three nutrient compounds were detected at elevated concentrations. Each had a unique chemograph with differences in transport processes (e.g. dependence on flow, dilution processes and timing of concentration pulses). Resampling from the data set was used to assess uncertainty. Bias existed at lower sampling efforts but depended on estimator properties as sampling effort increased: the interpolation, ratio and regression estimators became unbiased. Large differences were observed in precision and the importance of sampling effort and estimator selection depended on the relationship between the chemograph and hydrograph. The variety of transport processes observed and the resultant variability in uncertainty suggest that useful load estimates can only be obtained with sufficient samples and appropriate estimator selection. We provide a rationale to show the latter can be guided across sampling periods by selecting an estimator where the sampling regime or the relationship between the chemograph and hydrograph meet its assumptions: interpolation becomes more correct as sampling effort increases and the ratio becomes more correct as the r(2) correlation between flux and flow increases (e.g. > 0.9); a stratified composite sampling approach, even with random samples, is a promising alternative.

AB Waterborne outbreaks of gastrointestinal diseases can cause large costs to society. Risk management needs to be holistic and transparent in order to reduce these risks in an effective manner. Microbial risk mitigation measures in a drinking water system were investigated using a novel approach combining probabilistic risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis. Lake Vomb in Sweden was used to exemplify and illustrate the risk-based decision model. Four mitigation alternatives were compared, where the first three alternatives, A1-A3, represented connecting 25, 50 and 75%, respectively, of on-site wastewater treatment systems in the catchment to the municipal wastewater treatment plant. The fourth alternative, A4, represented installing a UV-disinfection unit in the drinking water treatment plant. Quantitative microbial risk assessment was used to estimate the positive health effects in terms of quality adjusted life years (QALYs), resulting from the four mitigation alternatives. The health benefits were monetised using a unit cost per QALY. For each mitigation alternative, the net present value of health and environmental benefits and investment, maintenance and running costs was calculated. The results showed that only A4 can reduce the risk (probability of infection) below the World Health Organization guidelines of 10(-4) infections per person per year (looking at the 95th percentile). Furthermore, all alternatives resulted in a negative net present value. However, the net present value would be positive (looking at the 50th percentile using a 1% discount rate) if non-monetised benefits (e.g. increased property value divided evenly over the studied time horizon and reduced microbial risks posed to animals), estimated at 800 1200 SEK ((sic)100-150) per connected on-site wastewater treatment system per year, were included. This risk-based decision model creates a robust and transparent decision support tool. It is flexible enough to be tailored and applied to local settings of drinking water systems. The model provides a clear and holistic structure for decisions related to microbial risk mitigation. To improve the decision model, we suggest to further develop the valuation and monetisation of health effects and to refine the propagation of uncertainties and variabilities between the included methods.

AB In a previous study, the Comet assay was optimized for Palaemon serratus prawns in order to propose a biomarker for sperm quality in this species. However, better knowledge of its basal level and its natural variability, related to intrinsic biotic and environmental abiotic factors, is required before any relevant use of this biomarker in the field. To fulfill this goal, the present study proceeded in three steps: (i) the temporal variability of DNA integrity was followed monthly in a reference population over a 2-year period, (ii) the correlation between the main intrinsic biotic (i.e. size, weight and molting stage) and abiotic factors (i.e. water temperature) were recorded in the field, and the basal DNA integrity was assessed in order to scrutinize any confounding influence of factors unrelated to toxic response, (iii) the baseline level was used to discriminate biomarker response among different stations displaying contrasting contamination levels. The results of the two-year monitoring in the reference population revealed no correlation between the levels of spermatozoa DNA damage and temperature, body size, weight or molting stage. Only a slight variability between monthly samplings was detected. On the basis of these field-collected data, we defined a reference distributioh (i.e. 52.6 +/- 5.6 A.U) with a threshold value (i.e. 61.7 A.U). Finally, this threshold value proved its relevance to discriminate among stations with contrasting pollution levels around the Seine Bay. Indeed, the results suggest significant DNA damage in populations nearest the Seine estuary, a major source of contaminants in the Bay, and a lower effect in populations further away from the estuary. The overall conclusion was that the Comet assay on P. serratus spermatozoa could be a useful tool for the monitoring of the toxicological print within sperm and main globally the contamination exposure of crustaceans in marine waters.
