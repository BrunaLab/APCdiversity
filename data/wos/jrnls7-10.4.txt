AB Objective: To determine if a combined oral contraceptive (COC) initiated shortly after ulipristal acetate (UPA) administration interferes with its mechanism of action.
   Study design: Healthy, reproductive-age women of normal BMI with proven ovulation (serum progesterone >3 ng/ml) were enrolled for three cycles (Cycle 1, UPA only; Cycle 2 washout; Cycle 3 UPA plus COC). During Cycles 1 and 3, subjects were monitored with transvaginal ultrasound and blood sampling for progesterone and LH every other day until a dominant follicle measuring >15 mm was visualized. In both treatment cycles, subjects received UPA (30mg) and were followed daily with similar monitoring for up to 7 days. In Cycle 3 only, subjects initiated a daily COC (0.15 mg levonorgestrel/30 mu g ethinyl estradiol) 2 days after UPA. The study had 80% power to detect a 15% difference in the proportion of cycles with at least a 5-day delay in follicle rupture. We assessed follicle rupture as >50% decrease in mean size and adjudicated unclear outcomes with serum hormones.
   Results: A total of 36 women enrolled and 33 completed all study procedures [age 28.4 years (SD 3.9); BMI 23.4 (SD 2.4)]. Compared to Cycle 1, more subjects demonstrated evidence of follicle rupture in <5 days in Cycle 3 [1/33 (3%) vs. 9/33 (27%), p =.008]. We also included data from 2 subjects who experienced rupture prior to COC dosing in the analysis.
   Conclusion: UPA's effectiveness is significantly reduced by administering COCs 2 days later. Implications: This study demonstrates that UPA's efficacy as an emergency contraceptive is reduced with early exposure to C005. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID CALIFORNIA; SERVICES; CHALLENGES; PROVISION
AB Objective: To assess the availability of long acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods in Los Angeles County through providers participating in a California State Medicaid State Plan Amendment Program called Family Planning, Access, Care and Treatment (Family PACT).
   Study design: This was a cross-sectional telephone survey utilizing "secret shopper" methodology. From 855 Family PACT providers in Los Angeles County in 2015, a representative sample of 400 providers was selected for study. Young female researchers posing as potential patients called each sampled clinic to ask a scripted series of questions about LARC availability for Family PACT patients in that practice.
   Results: All but one eligible practice (99.7%) responded to our questions. Among the 336 responding practices, 284 said they accepted Family PACT. Of those accepting Family PACT, staff answering the telephone call at 61% said they did not provide any LARC method onsite, 2% provided all currently available LARC methods, and 6% provided same-day placement of any LARC.
   Conclusion: The majority of Family PACT practices surveyed said that they did not provide any [ARC onsite, and very few provided same-day LARC placement despite easy patient enrollment procedures, relatively reasonable reimbursement and concerted efforts to increase LARC use. Substantial barriers to greater uptake may rest at the provider level with either actual unavailability of LARC or staff perception of unavailability. Implications: Only a minority of Family PACT practices said that LARC methods were available onsite, which imposes substantial restriction to access for women who are entitled to have access without cost. Other states developing programs should be aware of this challenge. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   guidelines; data-sharing system
ID OUTCOMES RESEARCH; MEDICAL-RECORD; CARE; QUALITY
AB Objective: To evaluate the ability of electronic health record (EHR) data extracted into a data-sharing system to accurately identify contraceptive use.
   Study design: We compared rates of contraceptive use from electronic extraction of EHR data via a data-sharing system and manual abstraction of the EHR among 142 female patients ages 15-49 years from a family medicine clinic within a primary care practice-based research network (PBRN). Cohen's kappa coefficient measured agreement between electronic extraction and manual abstraction.
   Results: Manual abstraction identified 62% of women as contraceptive users, whereas electronic extraction identified only 27%. Long acting reversible (LARC) methods had 96% agreement (Cohen's kappa 0.78; confidence interval, 0.57-0.99) between electronic extraction and manual abstraction. EHR data extracted via a data-sharing system was unable to identify barrier or over-the-counter contraceptives.
   Conclusions: Electronic extraction found substantially lower overall rates of contraceptive method use, but produced more comparable LARC method use rates when compared to manual abstraction among women in this study's primary care clinic. Implications: Quality metrics related to contraceptive use that rely on EHR data in this study's data-sharing system likely under-estimated true contraceptive use. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

SO CONTRACEPTION

ID INTENTIONS; KNOWLEDGE; COHORT; TRENDS; YOUNG
AB Objective(s): Effective contraceptive method use is important for HIV-positive women to meet fertility goals, prevent unintended pregnancy and reduce risk of vertical HIV transmission. Our objective was to evaluate factors associated with HIV-positive women's contraceptive method use at last coitus defined as more effective [Tier 1 and 2 methods (T1/2)] versus less effective [Tier 3 or no method (13/none)] by the US Medical Eligibility Criteria for contraception use.
   Study design: HIV-positive women, recruited from an HIV clinic in Atlanta, Georgia, between 2013 and 2014, completed a survey of demographic, clinical and reproductive health characteristics surrounding contraception. We examined the relationship between survey responses and contraceptive method use at last coitus using 2'2 tests and multivariate logistic regression.
   Results: Thirty-one percent of this HIV-positive and predominantly African-American (90%) cohort reported usage of T1/2 methods.11 /2 methods use was higher among younger women [adjusted odds ratio (a0R)=.90, p=.008] and those in noncommitted relationships (aOR =.32, p=.027). Only 21% reported dual method use at last intercourse. Fifty-three percent and 31% reported having heard of the intrauterine device and implant, respectively. Misconceptions about contraception were common.
   Conclusions: The use of T1/2 methods was more common in this cohort than in the general African-American population, but overall use and dual method use can still be improved, particularly among older women and those in non committed relationships. Implications: As this population had low awareness and usage of T1/2 methods and expressed many misconceptions, reoccurring contraceptive counseling may be helpful. Providers should address patient-level barriers, pregnancy intentions, and the importance of dual method and T1/2 method use. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To describe the role of worksite characteristics, job role and abortion stigma in clinical abortion workers' occupational stress.
   Study design: We recruited nurses, medical assistants and counseling staff who provide abortion care at five hospitals and four freestanding clinics in Massachusetts. Study instruments assessed individual-level abortion stigma (the perception that others treat abortion as shameful, dirty and socially taboo) using the Abortion Providers Stigma Scale; job strain through the Job Content Questionnaire; and emotional burnout through the Depersonalization, Emotional Exhaustion and Personal Accomplishment subscales of the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Multivariable linear and logistic regression modeling tested for associations between job role, worksite type, stigma, job strain and burnout, accounting for demographic and job characteristics.
   Results: Of 205 eligible workers, 136 participated (66%). Forty-one percent were medical assistants, 50% nurses, and 9% counselors. In adjusted models, abortion workers with high stigma had increased odds of experiencing job strain [adjusted odds ratio (a0R) 3.94, 95% CI 1.19-13.05]. Compared to working in a freestanding clinic, working in a hospital was associated with lower odds of experiencing the low personal accomplishment dimension of burnout (aOR 0.49, 95% CI 029-0.84) and lower odds of experiencing the depersonalization dimension of burnout (aOR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0.28). Counselors had higher odds of depersonalization compared to nurses (aOR 4.56, 95% Cl 2.3-9.0).
   Conclusion: Hospital-based abortion workers experience lower risk for burnout than comparable workers in freestanding clinics, accounting for abortion stigma and job characteristics. Implications: Implementing structured supports to alter workflows or improve coping among workers in freestanding abortion clinics may help mitigate risk of worker burnout and associated turnover.

AB The aim of the present work was to evaluate and compare the performance in the removal of pathogenic microbes in four different types of decentralized wastewater treatment systems, namely: horizontal flow constructed wetlands (HFCW), vertical flow constructed wetlands (VFCW), biological sand filters (BSF) and biofilters (BF). All the systems analyzed are located in Jutland, Denmark. Water sampling took place during a three months period that covered from winter to spring. Conventional microbial indicators such as Escherichia coli total coliforms (TC), intestinal enterococci and sulphite-reducing clostridia were quantified using traditional microbiological culture methods, whereas Bacteroides spp. determination was performed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Other water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand (BOD5), total suspended solids (TSS), pH, temperature, ammonium concentration and conductivity of influent and effluent water samples were also analyzed. The results showed that bacterial indicators significantly reduced in all the systems analyzed. In general, BF showed the best performance in the removal of microbes for all bacteria studied, while BSF demonstrated an improved capacity to eliminate E. coli and TC. Contrarily, VFCW seems to be more effective reducing the amount of intestinal enterococci, sulphite-reducing clostridia, and Bacteroides spp. In the present study, HFCW were the less efficient wastewater treatment system for the elimination of the evaluated pathogens. However, the performance in the removal of microbes was still significant considering that such systems were the oldest under operation (with over 20 years of continuous task).

In this study, the Floristic Quality Index (FQI) was used to assess the vegetation habitat and the structural equation model (SEM) was applied to quantify the influences of different environmental factors on FQI in the Kunyang open-pit phosphate rock mine in Yunnan Province, China. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analyses revealed that great differences of vegetation community composition existed in the sampled plots, even those at similar distances to mining areas, which indicates that disturbing distance was not the only factor to determine the vegetation community. SEM results showed that Cu promoted the FQI most obviously (0.84), followed by Co (0.75), while the inhibition of Cd content in soil to the FQI was the most significant (-0.88), followed by TK (-0.82), and C (-0.79). Soil fertility quality and soil pollution indexes were also established to analyze the effects of comprehensive soil parameters on FQI. The results showed that the soil fertility quality index had a strong negative effect on FQI, which revealed that higher levels of TP, TN, TK, and other nutrients in the soil would produce 'toxicity' to the growth of vegetation. Findings from our study could provide a scientific method for assessing the ecological restoration results in the mining area.

AB A system dynamics model (SDM) is developed to assess the dynamic changes in water resources and the impacts of different policies and measures in the Weihe River Basin. The purpose of the model is to enhance understanding of the dynamic behavior of this interactive system and to provide decision support to promote the sustainable utilization of water resources and the coordinated development of socio-economic conditions and the ecological environment in the Weihe River Basin. Six scenarios are designed to simulate the variations in and the effects of key variables based on changing the values of parameters in the model. The simulation results show that the SDM developed in this study can provide deep insight into the actual system and accurately reflects the dynamic behaviour of the basin. The results of the scenario-based projections suggest that improving water efficiency is the most effective means of supporting rapid socio-economic development and improving the quality of the ecological environment.

TI Typha latifolia paludiculture effectively improves water quality and
   reduces greenhouse gas emissions in rewetted peatlands

AB Paludiculture, the cultivation of crops on wet or rewetted agricultural peatlands, sustainably integrates productive land use with the provision of multiple ecosystem services. Paludiculture crops thrive under waterlogged conditions that stimulate nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) removal from soil and water and convert serious drainage-induced carbon (C) losses to C sequestration. Nutrient uptake by paludicrops can prevent mobilisation after rewetting and provide opportunities for purification of nutrient-rich water. Uncertainty remains, however, if and to what extent N loading and a subsequent increase in biomass productivity affect nutrient cycling as well as emissions of the potent greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). In this study, we use mesocosms with rewetted peat to investigate the effect of different N sources in surface water on biomass production of Typha latifolia, a typical paludiculture crop, and the emissions of CH4 and N2O. Organic (Azolla filiculoides; urea) or mineral (KNO3 ; NH4NO) N was supplied either a single time (steady state) or repeatedly (pulse) to simulate a total surface water load of 150 kg N ha(-1) . We found that N stimulated aboveground and belowground biomass production and nutrient uptake by T. latifolia. These effects were absent in Azolla treatments. Whereas after two months CH4 emissions arose to substantial amounts (> 10 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1)) in unvegetated mesocosms loaded with organic N, they remained very low (< 1 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1)) in vegetated mesocosms, despite the labile C pool in the extensive belowground biomass and organic N loading. Overall, N2O emissions were close to zero and were only detected episodically after NO(3)(- )loading, irrespective of plant presence. Our findings support that T. latifolia as a paludicrop effectively removes various forms of N and P when harvested, and strongly mitigates CH4 emission after the rewetting of agricultural peat soils compared to unvegetated conditions.

AB The aim of this study is to assess a different approach of SWAT model setup with enhanced Hydrologic Response Unit (HRU) definition procedure. The method uses a set of customizable MATLAB scripts (hence, SWAT-LAB) to produce HRUs from a combination of topographic, soil, landuse and administrative unit rasterized datasets. We used this approach to setup, run and calibrate a large-scale transboundary Nemunas River model, consisting of eleven sub-models. Nemunas River is the major contributory that discharges into the Curonian Lagoon, which is the largest European coastal lagoon. Belarus, Lithuania, Poland and the Russian Federation Kaliningrad Oblast share Nemunas River basin area. The basin is experiencing nutrient load from different sources in the riparian countries, nevertheless, the burden of improving the water quality of the river falls mainly on Lithuania. This article focuses on assessing the practicability of SWAT-LAB for creating a high-resolution large-scale transboundary hydrological and water quality model, where data availability is limited and fragmented. We demonstrate the model performance on a case study of one of the Nemunas River tributaries: Neris or Vilija River basin, which is situated largely in the Republic of Belarus. Model performance was evaluated graphically, using hydrographs and percent exceedance curves, and quantified using coefficient of determination (R-2) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NS). We achieved good model performance for monthly (calibration R-2 = 0.80, NS = 0.83; validation R-2 = 0.80, NS = 0.76) and daily (calibration R-2 = 0.66, NS = 0.66; validation R-2 = 0.67, NS = 0.66) flow. Satisfactory performance results were achieved in modeling monthly loads of suspended sediments (calibration R-2 = 0.4, NS = 0.44; validation R-2 = 0.58, NS = 0.34), total phosphorus (calibration R-2 = 0.71, NS = 0.61; validation R-2 = 0.53, NS = 0.56) and total nitrogen (calibration R-2 = 0.55, NS = 0.42; validation R-2 = 0.48, NS = 0.4). Furthermore, we use the model to assess possible future nutrient loads that could be transported from Belarus to Lithuania under two climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) and present the results.

AB Tidal marshes are sensitive and vulnerable to changes in the estuarine circulation. Various anthropogenic and climatic changes challenge the stability and fate of tidal marshes and introduce complicated management problems. Although the wind plays a key role in governing estuarine circulation in bays, few studies have evaluated its ecohydrological effects on tidal marshes and the interactions of its effects with those of anthropogenic activities. In this study, the independent and simultaneous effects of wind regime change and land reclamation projects were evaluated at the Mai Po Tidal Marsh in the Deep Bay, Pearl River Estuary as a case study. In recent decades, the wind regime in the Pearl River Estuary led to a stronger northeast monsoon during the dry season and a stronger southwest monsoon during the wet season. The results of hydrodynamic simulation show that the change in the wind regime and reclamation altered the governing roles of tide and freshwater discharge in the bay's seasonal estuarine circulation. The reclamation projects in the bay enhanced the effects of the stronger southwest monsoon in accelerating the estuarine circulation during the wet season, but reversed the effects of the stronger northeast monsoon in inhibiting the estuarine circulation during the dry season. Benthic infauna were used as an ecological indicator to assess the stability of the estuarine ecosystem. The predicted spatial averaged biomass of benthic infauna in the tidal marsh increased by 2% annually with the wind regime change but decreased by 28% with the reclamation; these trends were consistent with field observations. Although the change in the wind regime led to a direct reduction in the hydrodynamic disturbance in the tidal marsh and contributed to ecosystem stability, it may have shifted the hydrodynamics from sediment deposition to an erosion environment in the tidal marsh during the dry season, threatening the long-term fate of the tidal marsh.

AB Objective: To assess the accessibility of ulipristal acetate (UPA) and copper intrauterine devices (IUDs) for emergency contraception (EC) in reproductive health centers in the Kansas City metropolitan area.
   Study design: Using a secret shopper method, two female investigators called the reproductive health centers listed as EC providers on the nonprofit website bedsider.org that were located within 25 miles of the University of Kansas Medical Center. We categorized clinics as Title X providers vs. not according to the grantee list from the Office of Population Affairs. Investigators inquired about obtaining a UPA prescription by phone, the availability of the copper IUD for EC and time to first available appointment for EC. We evaluated correlates of EC access and provision with Fisher's Exact Tests.
   Results: We identified 40 clinics as potential EC providers. Some clinics reported that UPA could be prescribed by phone to existing patients (13/40, 32%), while others reported that women must meet with a provider first (15/40, 38%). Few clinics offered copper IUDs as EC (3/40, 8%). Title X clinic status did not predict provision of UPA by phone or copper IUDs as EC. The average time to next available appointment was 9 9 days to discuss EC and 13 9 days for a copper IUD.
   Conclusions: Accessing the most efficacious forms of EC in a timely fashion presents many logistic challenges for women. Implications: Healthcare systems should streamline protocols, train providers and improve rapid-access referral networks to facilitate timely provision of UPA and copper IUDs for EC (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: Integration of services is a promising way to improve access to contraception in sub-Saharan Africa, but few studies have evaluated this strategy to increase access to contraception among women requiring anticoagulation. Our objective was to evaluate a model of care integrating contraceptive counseling and provision within an anticoagulation management clinic in Eldoret, Kenya, to determine the impact on long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) use.
   Study design: We performed a prospective observational study of reproductive-age women referred for integrated services from the anticoagulation management clinic at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital from March 2015 to March 2016. All participants received disease-specific contraceptive counseling and provision, free reversible methods (excluding hormonal intrauterine devices [IUDs]) and follow-up care. We compared LARC use 3 months postintervention to preintervention using the proportions test. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors related to use of contraceptive implants and copper IUDs.
   Results: Of 190 participants, 171 (90%) completed 3-month follow-up. There was a significant increase in contraceptive implant use from 10% to 19%, p=.02, and injectable contraceptive use from 14% to 24%, p=.013. There was a concomitant decrease in the use of no method/abstinence from 57% to 39% (33% decrease, p<.001). Younger age, having at least one child and discussing family planning with a partner were predictive of LARC use.
   Conclusion: Integrating contraceptive services into an anticoagulation management clinic increases the use of highly effective contraception for women with cardiovascular disease. Implementation of similar models of care should be evaluated within other sites for chronic disease management. Implications: A model of care integrating contraceptive counseling and provision into anticoagulation management services is an effective strategy to improve LARC and overall highly effective contraceptive use among women with cardiovascular disease requiring anticoagulation. This model of care may be utilized to prevent maternal morbidity and mortality among this high-risk population. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Do women know whether their hospital is Catholic? Results from a
   national survey
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article

   awareness; Patient information; National survey
ID EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION; RELIGIOUS RESTRICTIONS; MANAGEMENT
AB Objectives: Catholic healthcare limits access to common reproductive care. We assessed what percentage of US women seeking care at Catholic hospitals are aware of their hospital's religious affiliation and identified variables associated with correct identification.
   Study design: We conducted a national survey of women ages 18-45 (response rate 50%). The survey asked participants what hospital they would go to for reproductive care and what the religious affiliation of that hospital was. We verified responses as correct or incorrect against a known Catholic hospital list. We used bivariate analysis and logistic regressions to evaluate factors associated with correct identification.
   Results: Sixteen percent of women reported a Catholic hospital as their primary hospital for reproductive care. Among women whose primary hospital was Catholic, 63% [95% confidence interval (CI): 54.5-70.7] correctly identified this, compared to 93% who correctly identified their hospital as non-Catholic (95% CI 91.4- 95.0). Two thirds of respondents who misidentified their Catholic hospital's affiliation reported that their hospital was secular (66%), and 48% of those women felt sure or very sure of their incorrect response. Factors associated with correctly identifying Catholic hospitals included hospital with a religious-sounding name [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=2.80; 95% CI: 1.07-7.34], respondent older age (aOR=3.77; 95% Cl: 1.35-10.56), metropolitan residence (aOR=3.35; 95% CI: 1.01-11.10) and income over $100,000 (aOR 4.95; 95% CI 1.35- 18.17).
   Conclusion: Over one third of US women who named a Catholic hospital as their primary hospital for reproductive care are unaware it is Catholic. Women are more likely to correctly identify a hospital as Catholic when that hospital has a religious sounding name. Implications: Patients need accurate information in order to make decisions about where to seek reproductive healthcare. Our results suggest that women are often unaware of their hospital's religious affiliation. Efforts are needed to increase hospital transparency and patient awareness of the implications that arise when healthcare is restricted by religion. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Capturing compassion: A survey of Mexican Catholics assessing abortion
   support by reason for abortion and degree of Catholicism
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Abortion; Catholicism; Religion; Latin America and the Caribbean;
   Mexico; Reproductive health
ID PUBLIC-OPINION; ATTITUDES; RELIGION
AB Objective: No standard exists to measure religiosity in abortion studies. We test whether religiosity is associated with support for abortion among Mexican Catholics and whether different measures of degree of Catholicism alter the relationship.
   Study design: We conducted a nationally representative cross-sectional study using survey data from 2669 self identified Mexican Catholics (response rate 85%). Our three outcomes were 1) overall support for legal abortion and support for abortion under exceptions, grouped as having 2) traditionally high agreement (rape, life) and 3) low agreement (on demand, socioeconomic). We used logistic regression controlling for sociodemographic covariates to test the association of four measures of Catholicism with our outcomes.
   Results: The majority of Mexican Catholics support abortion in some circumstances. (90% at least one high agreement exception and 40% at least one low agreement exception). The only measure of degree of Catholicism significantly associated with all our outcomes was belief that a person who helps someone who aborts can be a good Catholic. Those who agreed (versus not) had higher odds of support for abortion for both high agreement (aOR 3.6 [95% CI: 1.7-7.9]) and low agreement (aOR 1.9 [95% CI: 1.3-2.7]) exceptions. Respondents who believe a woman who aborts does not need to confess (aOR 2.1 [95% CI: 1.5-2.8]) or needs to confess to God (aOR 1.4 [95% CI: 1.04-1.8]) versus a priest had higher odds of agreement with at least one low agreement exception.
   Conclusion: Opinion toward abortion among Mexican Catholics is diverse. More nuanced measures of Catholicism are valuable in assessing support for abortion, especially exceptions with low support. Implications: The main reasons women need abortion are precisely those with low support among Mexican Catholics. Focusing on nuanced measures of Catholicism can help us identify areas for shared values and frame messaging to meet the diversity of Catholic opinion. Catholicism is not an unsurmountable barrier to liberalization of abortion law. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Estimating abortion incidence among adolescents and differences in

LA English
DT Article
DE Induced abortion; Abortion complications; Adolescent; Unintended
   pregnancy; Family planning
ID EARLY SEXUAL DEBUT; EARLY MARRIAGE; SAFE ABORTION; PREGNANCY;
   TERMINATION
AB Objectives: To provide the first estimate of adolescents' abortion incidence in Uganda and to assess differences in the abortion experiences and morbidities of adolescent and nonadolescent postabortion care (PAC) patients.
   Study design: We used the age-specific Abortion Incidence Complications Method, drawing from three surveys conducted in Uganda in 2013: a nationally representative Health Facilities Survey (n=418), a Health Professionals Survey (n=147) and a Prospective Morbidity Survey of PAC patients (n=2169). Multivariable logistic and Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare adolescent and nonadolescent PAC patients on dimensions including pregnancy intention, gestational age, abortion safety, delays to care, severity of complications and receipt of postabortion family planning. We included an interaction term between adolescents and marital status to assess heterogeneity among adolescents.
   Results: Adolescent women have the lowest abortion rate among women less than 35 years of age (28.4 abortions per 1000 women 15-19) but the highest rate among recently sexually active women (76.1 abortions per 1000 women 15-19). We do not find that adolescents face greater disadvantages in their abortion care experiences as compared to older women. However, unmarried PAC patients, both adolescent and nonadolescent, have higher odds of experiencing severe complications than nonadolescent married women.
   Conclusions: The high abortion rate among sexually active adolescents highlights the critical need to improve adolescent family planning in Uganda. Interventions to prevent unintended pregnancy and to reduce unsafe abortion may be particularly important for unmarried adolescents. Rather than treating adolescents as a homogenous group, we need to understand how marriage and other social factors shape reproductive health outcomes.
   Implications: This paper provides the first estimate of the adolescent abortion rate in Uganda. Studies of adolescent abortion and reproductive health must account for sexual activity and marital status. Further, interventions to address unintended pregnancy and unsafe abortion among unmarried women of all ages in Africa should be a priority. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: To describe a new measure, the unintended pregnancy risk index (UPRI), which is based primarily on attitudinal and behavioral measures of women's prospective pregnancy desire, and compare it to the unintended pregnancy rate, typically calculated retrospectively.
   Study design: We used three rounds of the National Survey of Family Growth to calculate trends in the UPRI and compare it to the retrospective rate. The UPRI estimates the annual risk of becoming unintentionally pregnant on a scale from 0 to 100. It is based on women's prospective pregnancy desire as well as fecundity, sexual activity and contraceptive use patterns.
   Results: Among all women aged 15-34, the UPRI ranged from 7.4 in 2002 to 5.7 in 2013. The retrospective unintended pregnancy rate had similar levels and declines for the same overall period, although the UPRI declined earlier than the retrospective rate.
   Conclusions: Changes in the use of any contraceptive method, the methods used and the effectiveness of the methods used all contributed to the decline in the UPRI. Implications: The sufficiency of retrospective measures of pregnancy intention has been challenged, and data availability has constrained needed surveillance of the unintended pregnancy rate. The UPRI offers a new measure that can be calculated with existing national surveillance data or for any population for which data on prospective pregnancy desire, pregnancy risk and contraceptive use are available.

AB Objectives: To refine the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s contraceptive education poster using patient-centered design.
   Study design: We conducted cognitive interviews with 26 women aged 18-44 living in North Carolina who spoke and read English and had ever had sex. We interviewed women about both a CDC and a patient-centered poster in alternating order. Participants were contraceptive users and non-users that we selected purposively to have a range of characteristics that might influence their perspective: age, race/ethnicity, previous births and pregnancies, contraceptive method(s) used in the past three months, pregnancy intentions, and numeracy. The initial response rate for participants was 55%. We used cognitive theory to code interviews for comprehension, relevance, and acceptability, as well as design and overall preference. We structured the 26 interviews into four rounds and revised the patient-centered poster after each round to improve these measures.
   Results: By the final round, 83% of women preferred the patient-centered poster. The majority of women favored this poster's relevance (86%), and design (100%) and ease of comprehension (86%). Women raised few concerns about the acceptability of the final version of the patient-centered poster. Women identified many issues with both posters that the researchers did not anticipate, highlighting the value of patient-centered design approaches to educational materials.
   Conclusions: This study refined a patient-centered poster so that its language is clear and it addresses the informational needs of its target audience. Implications: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Office of Population Affairs recommend that clinicians educate women about contraception. This study developed a poster that could help clinicians follow this recommendation. Before widespread implementation, more research is needed to evaluate the poster's impact on contraceptive knowledge and behaviors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   EXPERIENCES; TERMINATION; CARE
AB Objective: To investigate if women desire talking to a counselor or physician about contraception when seeking first-trimester medical or surgical abortion.
   Study design: We conducted a cross-sectional study by distributing self-administered anonymous surveys to women at three clinics in Sacramento, California; Chicago, Illinois; and Cleveland, Ohio, from October 2014 to February 2015. Participants completed surveys after registration and before any in-office counseling. We asked whether women want to discuss contraception, specific topics they want to discuss, reasons why they may not want to talk about contraception and whether they want to receive contraception services as part of their abortion care. We conducted regression analyses to assess associations between patient characteristics and the desire for counseling.
   Results: Among 3041 eligible women, 1959 (64.4%) completed surveys. Overall, 1208 (61.7%) did not want to discuss contraception prior to having an abortion, primarily citing that they already know which method they want. We found no association between the desire to discuss contraception and age, race, planned abortion method, clinic site and number of unplanned pregnancies. Among those who desired to talk about contraception, subjects preferred to discuss which contraceptive methods are easier to use and more effective as compared to previously used methods. Regardless of their desire for a discussion about contraception, 1386 (70.8%) of subjects wanted to leave the clinic with a specific method, including a long-acting reversible method [intrauterine device or implant (190,13.7%)] or other hormonal method [pills, patch, ring or injectable (680, 49.1%)].
   Conclusions: The majority of women seeking first-trimester abortion do not come to the clinic wanting to discuss contraception, most commonly because they have a preferred method in mind. Implications: Providers should ask women presenting for abortion if they want to discuss contraception and not assume that they need or desire such information. Focused discussions, starting with the preferred method if known, may better satisfy women's preferences. Providers should account for such desires when allocating resources for contraception services during abortion care. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Low but rising serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels occur infrequently after an induced abortion. Because this scenario rarely occurs after suction aspiration, clinicians may have higher suspicion for an uncommon diagnosis. The differential diagnosis includes both common and uncommon diagnoses, such as incomplete abortion, heterotopic or ectopic pregnancy, a new intrauterine pregnancy and gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. The etiology of this presentation may be unclear, especially in the absence of abnormal bleeding or pain which would suggest incomplete abortion, or when significant time has passed since the procedure. We describe two cases of an uncommon presentation of retained products of conception after aspiration abortion in which hCG levels were low but rising. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Delocalization error or many electron self-interaction error related to the fractional occupation number is studied within the framework of the density matrix expansion based meta-GGA level range-separated hybrid functional. The present study mainly focuses on the performance of that functional with the BECKE88 exchange based local, global and range-separated hybrids. It is observed that using the Kohn-Sham kinetic energy dependent exchange hole, several properties relating to the fractional occupation number are significantly improved without hindering the atomization energy accuracy. The present systematic assessment and functional performance for G2/148 test set and (non-) hydrogen barrier heights indicate that beyond the BECKE88 based range-separated functional, present meta-GGA level range-separated functional can be used for further molecular simulations.

AB The n-heptane isomerization was comparatively investigated over various catalysts, and significantly higher n-heptane conversion and isomerization selectivity were achieved with Pt/SBA-15 catalyst. The kinetics of n-heptane isomerization has been examined as a function of n-heptane and hydrogen pressures at various temperatures. Two kinetics model based on power law and Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism were developed for the reaction and compared with the obtained experimental data. The apparent kinetics parameters were estimated using multiple regression analysis. The reaction order is positive for n-heptane over most catalysts, suggesting strong coverage and negative order with respect to H-2, indicating the inhibitory effect of H-2.

AB A controversy about a proton transfer (PT) from a water molecule to the sulfate ion is presented in theoretical studies of isolated MgSO4 center dot 6H(2)O systems in the forms of contact (CIP) and solvent-share (SIP) ion pairs. Calculations with different methods and basis sets were performed without and with solvation. The results show that a PT may occur in a system without solvation; however, the no proton transfer (NPT) structure is also stable. The formation of either PT or NPT depends on the starting location and orientation of the sixth water molecule. In particular, we find that solvation favors NPT formation.

AB An information-theoretic model describes the dissipative dynamical systems composed of ensembles of fragmenting, self-organizing fullerenes. The probabilities derived from the variations of the fullerene number densities that occur during cage -> cage transformations are used to evaluate Shannon entropies for every carbon cage. Fractal dimension of the cages are calculated from their respective entropies. C-60 is shown to emerges as the end-directed evolution of dynamical systems of four different ensembles of fullerenes. The information generating, transforming cages of carbon provide a perspective to evaluate the self-organizational behavior of dissipative structures.

AB We present a theoretical investigation on the structural evolution and electronic properties of Nb2Sin-/0 (n = 13-20) clusters. The two Nb atoms tend to stay close and occupy the high coordination sites. Their most stable structures can be described as a central axis of Nb-Nb bond surrounded by the Si n frameworks. The structural evolution between Nb2Sin- anions and Nb2Sin neutrals is markedly different. Nb2Si19- is found to be the critical size of forming Nb-2-endohedral structure for anionic clusters, whereas the Nb-2-endohedral structure forms at n = 20 for neutral clusters.

AB The mono deuterium equilibrium isotope effect (EIE) for the exchange of hydroxyl deuterons and protons on 2-hydroxyl and 4-hydroxyl of 2, 4-dihydroxybenzaldehyade were calculated theoretically and also measured with NMR. The equilibrium constant (K-eq = 1.108) was predicted using the geometry and vibrational force constants derived from electronic structure theory followed by the program THERMISTP, which is highly consistent with the NMR results (experimental K-eq = 1.081 and K-eq = 1.066), indicating the formation of the strong hydrogen bond between 2-hydroxyl and the aldehyde group.

AB We synthesized triangular gold nanoplates (AuNPs) through a one-pot seedless growth method and characterized their optical properties under dark-field (DF) microscopy at the single particle level. We experimentally demonstrated that the dipole resonance is not completely separated from the quadrupole resonance for single AuNPs with an aspect ratio of similar to 5. We further used a defocused orientation and position imaging technique to visualize the spatial scattering field distributions from dipole and quadrupole modes. Their optical properties were mainly dominated by the dipole resonance, which resulted in the polarization-dependent, periodic DF defocused images and intensities of single AuNPs.

Here, we present a reactive bond fluctuation model (rBFM), that bases on a 3D lattice-based Monte-Carlo method, to model the full structure formation process of the complex TP process. Thus, we can analyze the final structures and compare them with experimental data. We show that the rBFM can capture the full TP process and that we find a good agreement between simulation and experiment.

AB The tetrasulfur tetranitrogen (S4N4) compound has attracted attention for its unusual "extreme cradle" structure. We report here the nature and magnitude of noncovalent interactions of S4N4 with model pi-ring systems. The sigma-hole of sulfur atom interacts with the pi electron density of benzene and naphthalene rings. The interaction energy of S4N4 with three naphthalene rings is similar to 20.0 kcal/mol. The fluorinated benzene rings showed weaker interaction with S4N4 compared to unsubstituted benzene rings. The energy decomposition analysis (EDA) reveals the larger contribution of dispersion energy in such complexes.

AB We present a formalism for the calculation of interfacial dielectric constant of hydration shells of proteins from configurations produced by atomistic numerical simulations. The theoretical approach is applied to classical molecular dynamics simulations of hydrated cytochrome c protein in the range of temperatures from 280 to 330 K. The interfacial dielectric constant was found to be equal to 2-4 depending on temperature. This dielectric constant reflects constraints imposed by the protein on the hydration waters and their low ability to polarize in response to an external field.

AB Co5.57Fe1.62Ni1.81S8 nanocomposite hybridized with reduced graphene oxide (Co5.57Fe1.62Ni1.81S8/rGO) was prepared through a one-step hydrothermal method. The hybrid was characterized by XRD, EDX, FESEM and HRTEM. The electrochemical hydrogen evolution behavior of nanohybrids with different mass ratios was studied as modified glassy carbon electrodes by linear sweep voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results showed overpotential in 10 mA/cm(2) ( -100 mV) for Co5.57Fe1.62Ni1.81S8/rGO (1 g:0.5 g) among all nanohybrids. Also, the obtained Tafel slope (53.6 mV/dec) confirmed the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for HER. The electro-catalytic properties for HER of Co5.57Fe1.62Ni1.81S8/rGO (1g:0.5 g) were compared with some transition metal dichalcogenide based composites.

AB A U (3) algebraic approach is proposed to describe 2D systems for effective potentials. Our approach is based on the 2D vibron model where the addition of a scalar boson is introduced into the 2D harmonic oscillator space. As a crucial ingredient of our approach an algebraic realization of the coordinates and momenta is obtained. This feature provides the tools to obtain the algebraic representation of a 2D Hamiltonian in terms of similitude transformation of a diagonal matrix. As an application of our approach the rotation-bending energy levels of carbon suboxide C3O2 are described in good agreement with experimental data.

AB Magnetoresistive, magnetic and thermoelectric properties of the La0.7Ba0.3MnO3/xNiO system are studied. The x-ray diffraction shows the coexistence of the NiO and the La0.7Ba0.3MnO3 phases in doped composites, revealing their interaction lack. This suggests the precipitation of the NiO at grain boundaries and on the La0.7Ba0.3MnO3 surface, interrupting the conduction between grains. Hindering the direct contact between the La0.7Ba0.3MnO3 grains increases the resistivity and decreases the metal-semiconductor transition temperature, leading to the spin tunneling effect. This enhances the room temperature magnetoresistance of the La0.7Ba0.3MnO3 compound from - 11.25% to -42.7% and -17.24% for 5% and 20% of the NiO additive amount, respectively. The pristine La0.7Ba0.3MnO3 compound shows a Curie temperature value of 348 K that fluctuates negligibly with the NiO addition. However, it decreases to 332 K at the x = 0.05 composite due to a tiny diffusion of NiO in the La0.7Ba0.3MnO3 lattice at this composite. The thermoelectric power properties of the La(0.7)Ba(0.3)MnO(3 )compound are changed with the NiO addition. Where the hole conduction interval increases and the peak of the Seebeck coefficient is shifted towards higher temperatures.

AB The photodesorption of CO from Si(100) has been studied using 355 and 266 nm light obtaining time-of-flight spectra detailing the translation energy released. The spectra clearly exhibit two non-thermal desorption channels, of which one is characterized by an offset energy the size of which is remarkably close to the vibrational quantum of CO. Detailed studies of the spectra as function of coverage and laser fluence used prove that both desorption channels originate from a single adsorbed species. It is suggested that the energy offset is due to vibrational to translational energy transfer along the reaction pathway of the desorbing molecule.

AB Stream restoration is often considered as an effective watershed management tool to reduce riverine loads of nitrogen, phosphorus, and suspended sediments, and meet government-mandated water quality goals. However, despite the billions of dollars which have been spent on stream restoration, questions remain about its effectiveness for improving water quality, as many studies report either mixed success or lack the adequate methodological framework to detect water quality improvements. In this study, we measured fluxes of nutrients and sediment in an eroded stream before and after restoration by filling the eroded channel with a mixture of sand, gravel, and woodchips stabilized with rock weirs at intervals along the channel. Our monitoring design used a before-after-control-impact (BACI) approach at two spatial scales, one at the reach-scale, and one farther downstream to detect whether reach-scale changes in nutrient and sediment loads propagated downstream. At the reach scale, we found that the restoration enhanced stream function, removing 44.8% of the phosphate, 45.8% of the total phosphorus, 48.3% of the ammonium, 25.7% of the nitrate, 49.7% of the total nitrogen, and 73.8% of the suspended sediment. However, due to hydrological variance, monitoring stations farther downstream suggested no detectable changes at the larger spatial scale relative to a reference stream, which highlights the challenges of detecting watershed-scale responses to small-scale stream restoration projects. This study provides a methodological framework for evaluating the effect of stream restoration on water quality at multiple scales and shows that reach-scale improvements may not be detectable at watershed-scales.

AB This short communication presents new data collected from a file-fed oxbow site in north-central Iowa and reports on the quantification of NO3-N load reductions using a mass balance approach. Using improved monitoring equipment deployed at the site in 2017, including a continuously-reading nitrate sensor, a NO3-N budget for the oxbow was developed to estimate annual and monthly load reductions occurring in the reconstructed oxbow. Daily NO3-N input was primarily from two drainage files and concentrations in the oxbow ranged from < 0.2 to 3.5 mg/l. Based on daily mass balance, the oxbow retained 42.3 kg of NO3-N, or 0.21 g N m(-2) d(-1) and the NO3-N retention efficiency was 35.4%. Removal efficiencies in early spring and late summer and fall were much higher than late spring and early summer. Based on mass load reductions, the effectiveness of oxbows for N load reductions is greatest when oxbows receive greater N loads from file drainage compared to N loads delivered from flood pulses.

AB Relationship between the phenolics content and the decomposition rate of Carex nigra, Scirpus sylvaticus, Phalaris arundinacea and Phragmites australis was evaluated in this study. The study was aimed at the selection of plants growing in the Czech Republic, that can be used for constructed wetlands treating agricultural runoff and that can also contribute to carbon sequestration. Plant decomposition was studied using the litterbag experiments lasting 365 days. One set of samples (each plant from three various location in four replicates) were taken after 81, 173, 301 and 365 days and decomposition rate was evaluated. The phenolics concentrations in aboveground biomass of selected macrophytes were varied in narrow range from 6.73 +/- 1.26 g.kg(-1) (leaves of P. arundinacea) to 14.09 +/- 3.52 g.kg(-1) (C. nigra). On the other hand, decomposition rate significantly varied among different plants and different plan parts as well. The close relationship between the concentrations of phenolics and decomposition rates was found for C. nigra, S. sylvaticus and leaves of P. arundinacea and P. australis in this study - the higher the phenolics concentration, the lower decomposition rate. The study also revealed a very strong relationship between total phenolics/total nitrogen ratio in the biomass, and therefore, the plants with high phenolics content would be more efficient in carbon sequestration. It is necessary to extend the research with the aim to find other plants naturally occurring in the Czech Republic characterized by high concentration of phenolics in the aboveground biomass, thus, having the potential of slow decomposition and high carbon sequestration.

AB Woodchip denitrifying bioreactors (WDBs) that target filtration of nitrate from farm drainage water are gaining recognition as a tool for tackling the issue of diffuse nitrate pollution from agricultural landscapes. Whilst the hydraulic regime and concentration of nitrate in the drainage water constitute two fundamental environmental variables that determine the size of a denitrifying bioreactor, the issue of over- or under-treatment of water that might otherwise promote undesirable pollution swapping phenomena and construction costs also need to be factored into the overall design process. Conventional methods for optimizing the design of denitrifying bioreactors generally rely on deterministic models, even though many of the design parameters are not known with confidence. In this work we apply an alternative design philosophy and demonstrate how the bioreactor design process can be improved through application of stochastic methods. The design aspect of an 'in-stream' WDB planned for installation on a farm in New Zealand is structured as a multi-objective performance optimization problem that is solved in a stochastic framework, using freely available open source tools. Uncertainty considerations regarding values of physical parameters that govern bioreactor performance are incorporated into the assessment, from which a Pareto set of optimal designs was obtained. A 75 m long bioreactor of 1.5 m height was selected as the preferred choice from the optimal set of design solutions. Assuming a 10-year operational life, it is predicted the cost of nitrate removal by the planned denitrifying bioreactor will be NZ$9.70/kg-N (approx.US $6. 60/kg-N).

AB A full-scale integrated ecological treatment system (IETS) comprising, in series from inlet to outlet: two biofilters, one surface flow wetland (SFW), and two stabilization ponds, was constructed to treat rural decentralized domestic sewage and swine wastewater. The results showed the IETS had high removal efficiencies for ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) with average values of 95.7%, 93.0%, 94.6%, and 82.0%, respectively. Incorporation in the IETS of the SFW, vegetated with Myriophyllum aquaticum, was found essential in enhancing the wastewater treatment. The abundances of the amoA gene of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) within the SFW sediment ranged from 1.69 x 10(8) to 2.46 x 10(9) copies g(-1) and from 2.63 x 10(7) to 6.90 x 10(7) copies g(-1) dry sediment, respectively. The greatest AOA and AOB abundances, which were observed at the outlet of the SFW, were found to be related to the decreasing NH4+-N concentrations along the water flow path. The abundance of the narG gene was approximately two orders of magnitude greater than that of nosZ. Multiple harvests of M. aquaticum contributed to 23.7-33.7% of TN removal and 34.2-49.5% of TP removal in the SFW. A plant management practice with a harvesting frequency of once every 20 days yielded the largest amounts of plant biomass and nutrient uptakes. These findings indicated that the vegetation of fast-growing macrophytes such as M. aquaticum in IETS was demonstrated to be an effective way for increasing plant uptake of N and P and enhancing microbial nitrogen-transforming activities, which contributed to improve IETS performance in decentralized rural wastewater treatment.

AB Engineering solutions that aim to restore hydrological connectivity in river systems fragmented by dams and weirs frequently include the installation of fish passage facilities (i.e. fishways). Assessment of fish passage performance is often limited to single fishway designs and with a focus on species of commercial or conservation significance, meaning that conclusions regarding fishway success may not apply to all species that require access to fragmented habitats. We simultaneously compared the population structure and fish assemblage composition at two fishways (vertical slot and fish lock designs) at weirs in a subtropical coastal river system. We used hydrological and physico-chemical water quality data to explore if fishway performance was linked to particular environmental conditions. At both fishways, fish assemblage composition differed between fishway exit and downstream river samples, yet differences between exit and river samples were not associated with hydrological variables related to the size and frequency of weir drown-out events or water quality. Population structure of the most abundant species (sea mullet, Mugil cephalus; 61% of fish samples) also differed significantly among fishway exit and river habitats. A low-level structure spanning the river channel downstream of one weir was not associated with differences in fish assemblage composition indicating that access to the fishway entrance (and therefore fishway use) was not hindered by in-stream obstructions. Eight and seven species (predominantly small-bodied species that migrate within freshwater systems) were exclusively sampled in downstream river locations at the vertical slot and fish lock fishways, respectively, indicating that neither design was fully capable of facilitating the passage of the local fish fauna. Further assessment over a broader range of hydrological conditions will be necessary to determine if use of either fishway by fish is affected by low flows. Coupled with evidence produced from landscape-scale analysis of spatial and temporal variation in fish assemblage structure and dispersal patterns of diadromous species associated with river flow regime highlight that hydrological connectivity may be maintained by natural weir drown-out events. This study highlights that factors controlling hydrological connectivity for riverine biota need to be integrated among co-occurring anthropogenic impacts to identify and overcome constraints to effective conservation management in rivers subject to water resource development.

AB Logging and restoration practices have significant impacts on the biodiversity of forest ecosystems. We studied the plant diversity patterns in temperate forests with different logging and restoration histories: the primary forest (no logging history), the secondary forest (natural recovery after logging) and the plantation forest (human planting after logging). In 2014 and 2015, we selected 12 plots with 24 trees, 48 shrub and 48 grass-herb quadrates on the southern slope of the Qinling Mountains in northwest China. We measured tree, shrub and grass-herb species in selected quadrates. Our results showed that (1) the diversity indexes of the secondary and plantation forests were not significantly lower than those of the primary forests; (2) the secondary forest had the highest tree and shrub species richness, followed by the low-elevation primary forest and the plantation forest respectively; (3) the high-elevation primary forest had the most unique tree and grass-herb species while the low-elevation primary forest had the most unique shrub species; and (4) compared with the primary forests, the species composition similarity indexes of the secondary forest and plantation forest had little difference. Our results indicate that primary forests play an irreplaceable role in forest biodiversity whereas secondary forests and plantation forests are still of biodiversity importance. We suggest that primary forests should be prioritized for protection while natural recovery as secondary forests in Qinling temperate region is an effective approach for maintaining biodiversity.

AB In this work, nanoporous carbon was synthesized from direct pyrolysis of ZIF-8, and the capacity fading of nanoporous carbon anode was explored. The structure, crystal phase, pore texture and elemental bonding were characterized by using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. When employed as anode for lithium ions batteries, the nanoporous carbon derived from ZIF-8 owns outstanding discharge capacity of 3164 mAh/g during the first circle. However, the charge capacity fades to 1347 mAh/g and the reversible capacity is only 42.57%. We have found that the structure damage and irreversible alloying reaction during insertion-desertion of lithium ions are responsible for this phenomenon. Innovatively, introduced density functional theory provides crucial proofs about capacity mechanism for N-doped graphene based nanoporous carbon anode of lithium-ion batteries.

AB The development of a new concept of support for catalytic activity is important in the development of catalysts. Dual-supports, composed of a mixture of two metal oxides, can increase catalytic activities by controlling the oxidation state of metal catalysts, as well as give multi-functionality to the catalyst, including photocatalytic properties and reusability. We report an aqueous-phase synthesis of Pd/and Pt/TiO2/Fe3O4 hybrid nanostructures. The synthesized nanostructures had metal nanoparticles with sizes of less than 2.8 nm. The synthesized nanostructures exhibited high H2O2 selectivity toward the H2O2 generation and also showed potential as a magnetic separable catalyst for both H2O2 synthesis and photocatalytic reaction.

AB The high-order harmonic generation (HHG) from a one-dimensional (1-D) model of H-2 molecule is investigated in the three-color laser fields by numerically solving time-dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE) in the Born- Oppenheimer Approximation (BOA) and Non-Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (NBOA) cases. The harmonic spectra are smooth with few modulations in the three-color laser fields. The semi-classical three-step model and the time-frequency analysis are employed to explain the HHG process. The nuclear and electronic probability density present the ionization and recombination process of the electron, which further explain the underlying physical mechanism of HHG. In addition, the electronic dynamics is demonstrated by the probability density distributions of the coupled electron nuclear wave packet.

AB A free-standing palladium/reduced graphene oxide paper (Pd/rGOP) based on one-pot co-reduction was prepared. The as-prepared Pd/rGOPs contain evenly distributed Pd particles interposing between the rGOP layers. The structure and composition of Pd/rGOP were characterized by SEM, EDX, XRD and Raman spectra. We investigated the glucose sensing performance of Pd/rGOP by chronoamperometry, the sensitivity reach as high as 6.70 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) with the linear range between 0.5 mM and 8 mM. The sensor also exhibits a good anti-interference ability and detection selectivity toward the interference. The proposed sensor has great potential to become a reliable tool in point-of-care medical devices.

TI Discovery of a new quantum spin Hall phase in bilayer plumbene
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
ID 2-DIMENSIONAL TOPOLOGICAL INSULATORS; PREDICTION; TRANSITION
AB Two-dimensional (2D) large-gap quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator are imperative for achieving dissipationless transport devices. The bottleneck preventing applications from QSH phase, however, is lack of feasible 2D films experimentally. By using first-principles calculations, here we propose a new 2D topological phase in the bilayer plumbene. Its geometric stability is confirmed by phonon spectrum simulation and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation. We find that it can turn into a nontrivial QSH phase under tensile strain and its nontrivial gap is highly tunable by external strains. The origin behind QSH effect can be identified by s-p(x,y) band inversion, topological invariant Z(2), and helical edge states within the bulk gap. Also, a heterostructure composed of bilayer plumbene deposited on semiconducting MoS2 substrate remains topologically nontrivial properties with a sizable gap. These findings provide a promising platform to design a large-gap QSH insulator in Pb film, which show potential applications in spintronics devices.

AB Highly crystalline FeWO4 nanorods (FWO NRs) prepared by a hydrothermal reaction is combined with g-C3N4 (gCN) nanosheet as an electrode material for the supercapacitor. Fabricated nanocomposites were analysed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS), and Raman Spectroscopy. Pseudocapacitive performance of the FWO/gCN nanocomposite was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance and galvanometric experiments in an alkaline medium. Thus FWO/gCN nanocomposite exhibited a high specific capacitance of 357 F g(-1) at 5 mV s(-1) and demonstrated a superior long-term cyclic stability, with the specific capacitance retention of about 80% after 1000 cycles.

AB We investigate the ion permeation trends for an aqueous sodium chloride solution through negatively charged carbon nanotubes under the simultaneous effects of a concentration gradient and an electric field using Molecular Dynamics simulations. A two-stage ion transport process was observed that resulted in a tunable effective ion flux toward the low concentration reservoir wherein the first stage resembled an electric-field assisted counter-ion (sodium) migration to the downstream reservoir for a short period of time followed by a second stage consisting of diffusion-driven electrolyte transport governed by the strength of the Donnan potential formed by the fixed charge on the nanotube.

AB In the present work, using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in accordance with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional we studied the adsorption of three harmful gas molecules namely ammonia (NH3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and phosphine (PH3) on the surface of the bismuthene nanotube (BiNT). We studied the response of BiNT as a chemi-resistor sensor for NH3, NO2 and PH3 gas molecules with regards to three essential features, namely energy gap variation, Bader charge transfer as well as the adsorption energy. Our results demonstrate that BiNT can indeed be successfully used as a chemical nanosensor for detection of NH3, NO2, and PH3 molecules.

The composite system was used as an active material for a device to demonstrate the electrical property. The system exhibited a nonvolatile switchable resistive behaviour with a constant ON-OFF current ratio of 2 x 10(3). The current-voltage behaviour of the metal-polymer based device was followed by the Poole-Frenkel emission and ohmic conduction mechanism.

AB The Multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) thin films has been formed on PVC substrate using Langmuir-Blodgett technique as highly promising material for optoelectronics. The layers were annealed at 367 K which has led to significant electrical resistance decrease. The resistance of the obtained layer was investigated in wide temperature range showing the dependence significantly different from that observed for the layers created using CNTs of smaller diameter. The reason of the unusual conductivity temperature dependence is most probably the difference in thermal expansion coefficients of MWCNTs and the polymer combined with relatively high stiffness of the nanotubes with such large diameter.

AB In this work, a uniform thickness of a two-dimensional carbon layer wrapping a three-dimensional flower-like TiO2 (CFT) is used to support Pd nanoparticles (Pd/CFT) as efficient catalyst for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol in a three-phase reaction system. The results of characterization reveal that the Ti-O-C bond plays a key role in establishing interactions between the CFT and Pd. In comparison to the Pd/AC catalyst, Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) with active phases can be effectively anchored on the surfaces of CFT without obvious dynamic change under reaction conditions.

AB ZnO nanorods were grown on ITO substrate by CBD method. The XRD and SEM show that nanorods with hexagonal column structure were uniformly distributed. Then the optical properties of NRs were investigated. The transmittance spectrum shows a sharp absorption edge in the UV region. The reflection spectrum has a certain oscillation frequency, so the thickness of film can be obtained by the principle of light interference. The PL spectrum shows a UV emission peak at about 380 nm and a broad green emission centered at around 550 nm. By readily adjusting the preparation parameters, the green emission was very weak.

AB Free energy barriers associated to the binding of small-molecules at phospholipid zwitterionic membranes have been computed at 323 K for a variety of species: tryptophan, histidine, tyrosine, serotonin and melatonin bound to a model membrane formed by di-palmitoyl-phosphatidyl-choline lipids inside aqueous sodium chloride solution. We have computed the radial distribution functions of all species for a variety of membrane and water-related sites and extracted potentials of mean force through the reversible work theorem. In all cases but histidine, the molecular probes are able to either be fully solvated by water or be embedded into the interface of the membrane. Our results indicate that binding of all species to water corresponds to free energy barriers of heights between 0.2 and 1.75 kcal/mol. Free energy barriers of association of small-molecules to lipid chains range between 0.6 and 3.1 kcal/mol and show different characteristics: all species but histidine are most likely bound to oxygens belonging to the phosphate and to the glycerol groups. Histidine shows a clear preference to be fully solvated by water whereas the aqueous solvation of serotonin is the less likely case of them all. No free permeation through the membrane of any small-molecule has been observed during the time span of the simulation experiments.

AB Poly-e-caprolactone (PCL) has been widely used in nanoparticle based drug delivery devices, owing to its hydrophobicity and biodegradability. In this study, we investigated the interaction of single block copolymer chains of PCL and Methoxy-polyethylene glycol (MePEG), as well as the self-assembled nano-polymeric micelles of these copolymers, with a model dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) lipid bilayer using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with umbrella sampling. Our studies showed that the hydrophilicto- hydrophobic ratio of the micelle plays a crucial role in the interaction with the bilayer. Significant changes in the micelle morphology akin to the 'snorkeling effect' was also observed.

AB First-principles calculations show that when a carbon adatom has been introduced to the surface of U@C-28 superatom, the neutral U@C-29 has (cage)(1)(adatom)(1) electronic state instead of (cage) 2 state in U@C-28. The valence orbitals of U atom keep fully occupied, while the origin of 32-electron principle is changed due to electron rearrangement via introducing the adatom. Furthermore, there exist two transition states when adatom slipping on the surface of U@C-28, indicating that it is a two-step process from [5: 5] to [6: 6] adsorption sites.

AB A transparent magnesium tin oxide thin film was prepared on a 330-nm-thick indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate. UV irradiation led to darkening of the film. The colored film could be reversibly decolorized by an appropriate thermal treatment. As this coloration-decoloration phenomenon did not occur without the ITO layer and the magnesium tin oxide layer was too thin to absorb the incident light sufficiently, the coloring process is thought to occur in the ITO layer. Ab initio calculations indicated that the darkening of the ITO layer was the result of oxidation caused by the magnesium tin oxide layer.

By simultaneous X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry measurements, solid phases were determined at LT. Depending on the molecular interactions, amorphization, crystallization, and cold crystallization were clearly distinguished. In the solid phases, the anion effect differs significantly from the alkyl chain length effect of the 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium cations, [C(n)mim](+).

Analysis of the samples' morphological and structural vibration properties were performed via scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectra show that Zn2SnO4 tetrapods are mainly distributed in the vicinity of the source material. The optical properties of the samples were studied using a fluorescence spectrometer, which showed that Zn2SnO4 tetrapods had an asymmetric, broad emission in the wavelength range of 450-800 nm. The mechanism of the broad emission is discussed.

AB This paper presents a new data processing method for calculating more reliable thermophysical properties of liquid using Green-Kubo Method based molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. In this study, MD simulations of water are first performed using three common water models. A new approach for analysing the simulation data is then developed to obtain statistically meaningful thermophysical properties such as thermal conductivity and viscosity. It is demonstrated that for a given desired standard deviation for a specific simulation, a suitable simulation box size can be determined. The proposed approach can assure the repeatability and reliability of the calculated thermophysical properties of liquid.

AB The crystal structures, electronic structures and oxygen vacancy formation energy of Sr3MgSi2O8-Sr3MgSi2O8-delta materials were investigated by the first-principles calculations. For the Sr3MgSi2O8, the band gap is calculated to be 4.99 eV. For the Sr3MgSi2O8-delta, a new band overlapping the Femi level appeared between the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB). The oxygen vacancy formation energy of Sr3MgSi2O8-delta with delta=0.125 has been calculated. The value is similar to 12.00 eV. In addition, it can be found that the oxygen vacancies trended to be dispersing over the Sr3MgSi2O8-delta lattice rather than getting together.

AB We have investigated the structures and stability of two dimensional (2D) Hf clusters on Ir(1 1 1) surface as the initial stage of hafnene growth using first principles density functional theory (DFT) with the generalized gradient approximation. The study reveals that the Ir supported Hf clusters of n hexagonal rings prefer a nearly flat honeycomb structure, with the exception of n = 1. The 2D Hf clusters, unlike to that of free-standing hafnene monolayer, exhibits no magnetic property mainly due to strong hybridization with the Ir(1 1 1) surface. A thorough investigation has also identifies the most stable structures and corresponding physical properties of free standing Hf-N (N <= 24) clusters.

AB An finite-nuclear-mass (FNM) approach is employed to describe the magnetic orbit-orbit interaction of the electrons and the nucleus orbiting around the center of mass of the helium atom in S-1 and P-1 Rydberg states. The calculations are performed using explicitly correlated Gaussian functions to expand the states' wave functions. The non-linear parameters of the Gaussians are optimized using a variational approach employing the analytical energy gradient. An FNM and INM (infinite-nuclear-mass) approaches are used in the optimization and compared.

AB Halogen bonding is nowadays a consolidated tool in chemistry. Only recently, the importance of halogen bonding has been demonstrated also in biological systems, owing to the presence of halogens in drugs. This interaction is due to the anisotropy of the electron density around the halogen that leads to the formation of the 'sigma-hole', which is responsible for the interaction with a nucleophile site. Unfortunately, classical force fields used in the study of ligand-receptor systems are not able to describe the 'sigma-hole'. Here, we propose a pseudo-atom based methodology able to correctly describe halogen bonding involving chlorine using classical force field.

AB The diatomic dications SrF2+ and SrCl2+ were investigated for the first time at a high level of theoretical approach, SA-CASSCF/MRCI. The overall energetic profile of all Lambda + S states correlating with the three lowest dissociation channels, and the associated Omega states provide reliable results to characterize the lowest-lying states as thermodynamic stable. Einstein spontaneous emission coefficients evaluated for perpendicular A(1/2)-X-1(3/2) transitions, and parallel and perpendicular A(1/2)-X-2(1/2) ones, and the spectroscopic parameters are expected to guide the spectroscopist in the challenging task of probing them experimentally. Similarities and differences with the CaF2+ and CaCl2+ results are discussed.

The whole observed data-set were well fitted by the target analysis using three independent components. Spectral shape of surface carriers and their time evolution obtained by the target analysis have intimate relation in the water-oxidation activities. A series of this type of investigation will contribute to the breakthrough of the material design for promising photocatalyst.

AB In this article, different kinds of volatile basic organic compounds (n-butylamine, morpholine, ethanolamine, triethylamine, pyridine) were investigated by using amperometric techniques with a narrow-gap cell. In case of bare electrode continuous current increase could be observed from beginning of exposure to the saturated vapour of all chemicals during the repetitive amperometric recording at 2 V working potential. The cell did not respond to triethylamine. When the cell was modified with 5-sulpho-salicylic acid the cell responded quickly and it showed high sensitivity to the investigated compounds. Repeatability was investigated which was satisfactory for all compounds except for ethanolamine and morpholine.

Here, we propose a pH-responsive Au cluster capturing-releasing system using the mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) modified by organic molecular tweezers. The pi-pi-pi stacking have been used to capture and stabilize the Au clusters in the pores of MSNs on the neutral or alkaline conditions, and responsively release and manipulate the Au clusters by adjustment of the pH value. The released Au clusters show high catalytic activity.

AB Improving the energy density without compromising the power capability is a classical challenge for electrochemical capacitors. Since energy is quadratically related to voltage by 1/2(Capacitance)(Voltage)(2) the most beneficial strategy to boost the energy density is to target the working voltage window. However, expanding the voltage window beyond 1.23 V in aqueous system is thermodynamically challenged due to parasitic water splitting reactions. We show that the parasitic chemistry can be arrested by decoupling the direct acid-alkali chemistry, and the voltage window in aqueous supercapacitors can be expanded with energy boosting up to similar to 230%.

AB Recent experimental studies of magnetic field dependent kinetics of singlet fission (SF) processes in some organic semiconductors [i.e. splitting of excited singlet (S-1) state into a triplet exciton pair] have revealed the important specific feature of obtained kinetic curves, associated with decaying intensities I (t) of fluorescence from S-1-state. Kinetic curves, measured in different magnetic fields, are found to cross each other. We show that this kinetic curves crossing (KCC) effect is a general feature of geminate condensed phase reactions, resulting from simple characteristic properties of kinetic schemes of processes. Specific features of the KCC-effect are analyzed in detail with some models of SF-processes.

AB The photodissociation dynamics of methyl radical from selected vibrational levels of the 3s and 3p(z) Rydberg states has been studied using the trajectory surface hopping method on one-dimensional potential energy curves along the carbon-hydrogen dissociative coordinate and the non-adiabatic couplings between them, calculated by ab initio methods. Lifetimes and product distributions have been obtained for all the studied vibrational levels and compared with previous theoretical and experimental works. The theoretical lifetimes tend to decrease as vibrational excitation increases in accordance with experimental results. The agreement, however, is only qualitative considering the reduced dimensionality of the model.

AB Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films having large stack of amphiphilic-fatty-acids bearing rare-earth-ions are ideal two-dimensional magnetic systems to study spin-vortex ordering as the distances of the magnetic-ions along the out-of-plane and in-plane directions differ by an order of magnitude. Here we present results of in-situ X-ray scattering measurements on Langmuir monolayer of the amphiphilic stearic acid on the water surface containing Gadolinium ions to understand the formation process of monolayer and multilayer LB films on the substrates. Infrared spectroscopy and microscopy measurements were also carried out to understand the growth and transfer mechanism of the LB films.

AB We have extended the divide-and-conquer (DC) coupled-cluster with singles and doubles (CCSD) to a fractional occupation number (FON) formalism, denoted as FON-DC-CCSD, using the thermal Wick theorem. The motivation is to address the inconsistency in the treatment of orbital occupations between the DC-based Hartree-Fock and the DC-CCSD methods, which adopt the Fermi distribution function and the step function for orbital occupation, respectively. Numerical applications involving polyene chains and single-walled carbon nanotubes confirm that the proposed FON-DC-CCSD method reduces both energy errors and computational costs compared with the conventional DC-CCSD method.

AB DFT and MP2 methods are used to unravel the syn and anti-configurations in the regio-stereoselectivity of carbonyl groups of 5 Fluorouracil paired with HF, CH3OH, H2O, and HCl proton donors. Two configurations of hydrogen-bonded complexes are found: anti-orientated complexes and syn-orientated complexes. The latter are found to be lower in energy than the former when proton donors attack on C=O-1 site, while the contrary is observed when C=O-2 site is attacked by proton donors. In syn-configuration, both C=O-1 and C=O-2 form clusters which are closer in H-bond interaction energies, but C=O-2 is predicted slightly as the preferred interaction site.

AB The effect of an external magnetic field on the radiation-induced fluorescence of tricosane (n-C23H48), doped with luminophore, was studied on the nanosecond timescale. It was found that the characteristic frequency of quantum beats caused by the difference between the Zeeman interactions of dopant radical anions and tricosane radical cations increased substantially upon transition from the liquid to the crystal phase. Experimental data were in agreement with both the quantum-chemical calculations and theoretical spin evolution simulations, assuming that hyperfine couplings and transverse components of the tricosane radical cation g-tensor were averaged out by degenerate positive charge transfer in the tricosane crystal.

AB Previously, we reported pivotal role of P2RX7 in augmenting autophagy in THP-1 cells upon Calcimycin treatment by modulating intracellular Calcium regulated ATP production but the role of immune modulators in Calcimycin induced autophagy is not known. In this study, we demonstrate that treatment with Calcimycin in PMA (Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) differentiated THP-1 (dTHP-1) cells significantly induced interleukin (IL)-12 mRNA expression and its release. IL-12 receptor (IL-12R beta 1 and IL-12R beta 2) was also significantly expressed on the cell surface in dTHP-1 cells upon Calcimycin treatment. We report that small molecule or siRNA based P2RX7 inhibition abrogated IL-12 release upon Calcimycin treatment. P2RX7 inhibition also resulted in reduced Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, I kappa B alpha phosphorylation, p65 translocation and NF-kappa B expression. Further, inhibition of NF-kappa B activation or IL-12-IL-12R interaction led to down-regulation of the expression of autophagy related markers such as Beclin-1, autophagy-related gene (Atg) 3, Atg 7 and impairment of micro tubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3-I (LC3-I) to LC3-II conversion. Finally, blocking of autophagy led to significant growth of intracellular mycobacteria in Calcimycin treated macrophages. Overall, these results reveal that interaction of Calcimycin with P2RX7 modulates intracellular JNK-NF-kappa B signaling pathway. This modulation results in IL-12 release that restricts the mycobacterial growth in THP-1 macrophages.

AB Purpose: Heart failure (HF) is considered to be a complex syndrome associated with neurohormonal and cytokine activation, that contribute to its progression. There are evidences which showed that, carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA 125), a tumor marker widely used for ovarian cancer therapy monitoring, was significantly elevated in HF patients. We hypothesized that inflammatory stimuli may be responsible for amino-terminal fragment of the prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and CA-125 production and release in chronic HF (CHF). We aimed to measure the levels of NT-proBNP, CA 125, pro-anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1 beta, IL-8, TNF-alpha and IL-4), from peripheral venous (PV) and coronary sinus (CS) blood samples, in patients with CHF and to assess their correlation with echocardiographic indices.
   Methods: We enrolled 32 subjects (20M/12F) with CHF (III-IV NYHA functional class) who were to undergo cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device implantation and 30 healthy controls (18M/12F). Two blood samples, from PV and CS, were collected at the time of CRT for each CHF patient. Serum levels of biomarkers were measured by ELISA. Cardiac function was assessed echocardiographically.
   Results: All investigated biomarkers were significantly higher in CHF patients than in non-CHF controls (P < 0.001). There were positive correlations between biomarkers concentrations in PV and CS (r between 0.54 and 0.98, all P < 0.003). NT-proBNP, IL-6 and IL-1 beta levels were 17%, 86% and 36% higher in CS than in PV, these increases being very well correlated each other, while CA 125 levels were 86% higher in PV than in CS. Moreover, CS NT-proBNP, CS IL-6 and CS IL-1 beta serum concentrations were inversely related to the echo cardiographically determined left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (r = -0.61, P < 0.001; r = -0.71, P < 0.001 and r = -0.48, P = 0.005, respectively). A positive relationship was found between CA 125 and IL-1 beta (r = 0.51, P = 0.003) in CS serum and between CA 125 and IL-6 (r = 0.43, P = 0.015), TNF-alpha (r = 0.46, P = 0.008) in PV serum. CA 125 concentrations were closely related to NT-proBNP both in CS (r = 0.46, P = 0.008) and PV (r = 0.52, P = 0.002).
   Conclusions: CS sampling of NT-proBNP, CA 125 and pro-anti-inflammatory cytokines provides an additional insight into the possible mechanisms by which these biomarkers lead to left ventricular remodeling. Our results clearly suggest that serum NT-proBNP and CA 125 levels not only in PV, but also in CS of patients with CHF, may be dependent on inflammation as a consequence of cytokine network activation.

AB Background: Adipokines are chemical mediators released from adipose tissue involved in regulation of appetite, insulin sensitivity, immune system and inflammatory responses. Adipokines contributes to low grade inflammatory response in autoimmune disease like Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) but the pathophysiology is yet not clear. The aim of this study is to understand role of adipokine interactions in SLE disease pathogenesis.
   Methods: Sixty newly diagnosed treatment naive SLE patients fulfilling the ACR criteria and forty age-sex matched healthy subjects were enrolled in thiscase-control study. Disease activity in SLE patients was evaluated using SELENA-SLEDAI.
   Array of adipokines, C1q circulating immune complexes (C1q-CIC), anti-C1q, anti-ribososmal P0 (anti-RibP0) and anti-mitochondria] antibodies (AMA) levels were detected by ELISA. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-dsDNA autoantibodieswere detected by Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF), while antigen specificities were detected by Immunoassay blot. Serum levels of C3 and C4 complement factors were assessed by nephlometer.
   Results: Statistically significant elevation in progranulin, adipsin and resistin levels was seen among SLE patients when compared to healthy controls (p < 0.0001). Leptin and omentin levels were significantly reduced in SLE patients (p < 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference in serum adiponectin, chemerin and visfatin levels when these two groups were compared (p > 0.05). Adiponectin, adipsin and resistin levels were elevated in SLE patients with renal manifestations (p < 0.05). Reduced leptin levels were significantly associated with presence of renal manifestations (p < 0.05). Adiponectin levels positively correlated with disease activity (r = 0.294, p = 0.027) whereas negatively correlated with C3 levels (r = -0.439, p = 0.0007). A positive correlation was observed between hypocomplementemia and leptin levels (p < 0.05). Leptin levels were negatively correlated with disease activity, anti-dsDNA, C1q-CIC and anti-C1q levels (p < 0.05). A significant positive correlation was observed between progranulin levels and anti-ribosomal PO antibodies (r = 0.499, p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: Adipokines levels and associated clinical manifestations suggest involvement of adipokines in disease pathogenesis of SLE. SLE disease activity and complement components may suggest regulatory effect of adipokines (adiponectin and leptin) on disease pathogenesis. Further studies on adipokines in SLE patients with renal manifestations may propose them as prognostic markers in renal damage.

AB Previous studies have highlighted the role of immune dysregulation in suicide behavior. Interleukin (IL)-8 is a chemokine with neuroprotective effects whose lower serum concentrations have been detected in individuals committed suicide. In the present study, we genotyped three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within IL-8 gene (rs4073, rs2227306 and rs1126647) in 229 individuals who attempted suicide with soft suicide methods, 235 suicide victims and 290 individuals without any history of psychiatric disorders or suicide attempt. The T allele of rs4073 was significantly over-represented in suicide attempt group compared with both control and completed suicide groups (adjusted P values of 8.3E-7 and 9.8E-8 respectively). This SNP was associated with suicide attempt in both dominant and co-dominant models (P values of 6.2E - 9 and 4.3 E - 8 respectively). The genotype and allele frequencies of other SNPs were not significantly different among the three study groups. The T C A haplotype (rs4073, rs2227306 and rs1126647 respectively) were significantly less prevalent in completed suicide group compared with suicide attempt group (OR (95% CI) = 0.63 (0.46-0.86), adjusted P value = 0.03). Besides, the A T A haplotype has significant lower frequency in individuals who attempted soft suicide compared with controls (OR (95% CI) = 0.44 (0.26-0.75), adjusted P value = 0.02). However, this haplotype was significantly more prevalent in individuals attempted hard methods compared with those attempted soft methods (OR (95% CI) = 2.21 (1.26-3.87), adjusted P value = 0.04). The present study provided further evidence for the role of IL-8 in suicide behavior.

AB Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) remains a major challenging complication of patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). CD4(+) effector T cells and their related cytokines mediate pathogenesis of aGVHD, in which donor-T-cell derived interleukin-22 (IL-22) was recently indicated to play a role. The role of recipient-derived IL-22 in aGVHD remains to be elucidated. By applying IL-22 knock out (IL-22KO) mice as recipients of allotransplant, we found recipient derived IL-22 alleviated aGVHD and improved survival of allotransplant recipients. Knock out of IL-22 in recipient increased levels of T-helper (Th1) 1 cells but decreased levels of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in target tissues of aGVHD. Levels of IL-22 increased in aGVHD mice. Recipient antigen presenting cells (APCs) are important sources of IL-22. IL-22 reduced activation of APCs in vitro. Defect of IL-22 in APCs resulted in increased polarization of Th1 cells but decreased level of Tregs in an in vitro co-culture system. Our data highlight an immunoregulatory function of recipient-derived IL-22 in aGVHD.

AB This study was based on the hypothesis that IL-1 beta and its central regulator, the inflammasome, may play a role in the inflammatory condition exhibited by placental tissues from mothers with different gestational hyperglycemia levels. Pregnant women were classified according to the glycemic reference as non-diabetic (n = 15), mild gestational hyperglycemia (n = 15), gestational diabetes mellitus (n = 15) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 15). We investigated levels of pro-inflammatory factors in maternal plasma and placental tissues (by ELISA or immunohistochemistry) and, NFKB activity (by electrophoretic mobility shift assay) and inflammasome protein expression (by Western blot) in chorionic villous. Maternal plasma and placental levels of inflammatory factors (IL-1 beta, IL-6, and MCP-1) were increased during all hyperglycemic conditions. Villous stroma cells showed strong immunoreactivity to CD68. In addition, with syncytiotrophoblast, the villous stroma cells were also stained to detect iNOS, MCP-1, TLR2, and TLR4. Although the levels of protein had fluctuated in the groups, NLRP1, NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase 1 were up-regulated in all hyperglycemic groups suggesting the inflammasome may be assembled in these pregnant women. The NFKB activity also exhibited higher levels in hyperglycemic groups, which might imply in pro-inflammatory cytokines production. In summary, increased maternal glucose levels during pregnancy changed systemic and placental inflammatory patterns, which occurred in parallel with the expression of inflammasome factors and processing and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta. These results suggest an inflammatory condition in all gestational hyperglycemic conditions, even in hyperglycemia that is less severe than gestational or overt diabetes, likely associated with inflammasome activation and inflammatory cytokine secretion. Inflammasome activation as a possible source of inflammatory factors may be an important target to be considered while managing hyperglycemia and preventing adverse pregnancy outcomes.

AB This study investigated the effects of a fish oil-based lipid emulsion (FO) on local skeletal muscle and remote renal damage at 72 h post-reperfusion in a murine model of hind limb ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Mice were assigned to 1 sham group and 3 IR groups. The IR groups were treated daily with either saline or FO from 3 days prior to limb ischemia till 3 days after reperfusion. Limb IR was induced by applying a 4.5-oz orthodontic rubber band above the left greater trochanter for 120 min followed by band-released reperfusion for 72 h. Mice were then sacrificed to harvest blood, muscle, and kidney for analysis. The results showed that IR injury led to upregulation of pro-inflammatory monocytes in blood, infiltration of leukocytes into injured muscle, and over expression of pro-inflammatory genes in muscle and kidney tissues. Supplementing FO either before or after IR injury alleviated IR-induced inflammatory gene expressions in muscle and kidney tissues. Furthermore, FO given after IR injury reduced circulating pro-inflammatory monocytes, limited muscle leukocytic infiltration, and improved renal histology. These results suggest that FO may protect the muscles from IR injury. FO given after IR injury can better downregulate the inflammation seen in IR-induced remote kidney injury.

AB Objective: Functions of the Th9 cells and its signature cytokine IL-9 in human autoimmune diseases is currently under extensive research. Here we are reporting new functions of IL-9-receptor (IL-9R); its regulatory role on (i) FLS (fibroblast like synoviocyte) biology and (ii) pannus formation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA).
   Methods: RA, PsA, and OA synovial tissue biopsies were obtained; FLS were derived and cultured from these tissues. T quantify protein and messenger RNA levels of IL9-receptor (IL-9R) Western blot and real-time PCR techniques were used. For Pro-growth/survival effect of IL-9 (rIL-9) Annexin-V (apoptosis assay) and MTT assays were used.
   Results: Immunoblot and RT-PCR studies demonstrated IL9-R in FLS of RA, PsA, and OA. IL9-R was functionally active. rIL-9 induced significant proliferation of FLS (p < 0.001) and had an inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha induced apoptosis. Proliferation of FLS induced by rIL-9 could be significantly inhibited (p < 0.001) with an IL-9R antibody. Further we observed, rIL-9 induced increased secretion of IL-6, IL-8 and also unregulated MMP-3 expression in FLS.
   Conclusions: Proliferation of FLS, induction of pro-nflammatory cytokines and upregulation of metaloprotinase (MMP 3) the key pathologic events for pannus formation are regulated by IL-9 and its recptor. Thus the IL-9/IL-9R system is a new contributing factor in the cytokine network of PsA and RA.

AB Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) causes a persistent, lifelong infection that increases risk for sexually transmitted infection acquisition. Both the lack of a vaccine and the need for chronic suppressive therapies to control infection presents the need to further understand immune mechanisms in response to acute HSV-2 infection. The IL-36 cytokines are recently identified members of the IL-1 family and function as inflammatory mediators at epithelial sites. Here, we first used a well-characterized three-dimensional (3-D) human vaginal epithelial cell (VEC) model to understand the role of IL-36 gamma in the context of HSV-2 infection. In 3-D VEC, IL-36 gamma is induced by HSV-2 infection, and pretreatment with exogenous IL-36 gamma significantly reduced HSV-2 replication. To assess the impact of IL-36 gamma treatment on HSV-2 disease pathogenesis, we employed a lethal genital infection model. We showed that IL-36 gamma treatment in mice prior to lethal intravaginal challenge significantly limited vaginal viral replication, delayed disease onset, decreased disease severity, and significantly increased survival. We demonstrated that IL-36 gamma treatment transiently induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides in murine lower female reproductive tract (FRT) tissue and vaginal lavages. Induction of the chemokines CCL20 and KC in IL-36 gamma treated mice also corresponded with increased polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocyte infiltration observed in vaginal smears. Altogether, these studies demonstrate that IL-36 gamma drives the transient production of immune mediators and promotes PMN recruitment in the vaginal microenvironment that increases resistance to HSV-2 infection and disease. Our data indicate that IL-36 gamma may participate as a key player in host defense mechanisms against invading pathogens in the FRT.

AB Helminth infection can reduce the severity of inflammatory bowel disease. However, the modulatory mechanisms elicited by helminth infection are not yet fully understood and vary depending on the experimental model. Herein we evaluated the effect of acute infection of BALB/c mice with Strongyloides venezuelensis on the clinical course of ulcerative colitis induced by Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS) treatment of these animals. For the experiments, S. venezuelensis-infected BALB/c mice were treated orally with 4% DSS solution for seven days. As controls, we used untreated S. venezuelensis infected, DSS-treated uninfected, and untreated/uninfected BALB/c mice. During DSS treatment, mice from the different groups were compared with regards to the clinical signs related to the severity of colitis and intestinal inflammation. Mice acutely infected with S. venezulensis and treated with DSS had reduced clinical score, shortening of the colon, and tissue inflammation. Moreover, DSS-treated and infected mice showed reduced IL-4, INF-gamma, and IL-17 levels and increase of IL-10 production in the colon and/or in the supernatant of mesenteric lymph nodes cell cultures that resulted in lower eosinophil peroxidase and myeloperoxidase activity in colon homogenates, when compared with DSS-treated uninfected mice. DSS-treated infected mice also preserved the intestine architecture and had normal differentiation of goblet cells and mucus production in the colon mucosa. In conclusion, the data indicate that the clinical improvement reported in DSS-treated infected mice was accompanied by the lower production of Th1/Th2/Th17 pro-inflammatory cytokines, stimulation of IL-10, and induction of mucosal repair mechanisms.

AB Deposition of amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's disease is accompanied by chronic inflammation, which involves raised levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 beta. However, the role of A beta(1-42) in the inflammatory process, before it gets deposited into aggregates has not been investigated thoroughly. Through this study, we are illustrating the dual role of soluble A beta(1-42) (sA beta(1-42)) in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome and simultaneously inhibiting TNF-alpha secretion. Our data suggested that the treatment of chronically induced THP-1 macrophages and N9 microglial cells with sA beta(1-42) can suppress the major inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha without affecting the level of IL-6. However, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was well evidenced by secretion of IL-1 beta, increased expression of NLRP3 and caspase-1, implicating sA beta(1-42) in enhancing and suppressing one or other type of inflammation. Further investigation revealed that sA beta(1-42) was able to severely abrogate the expression of NF-kappa B, p50 and restricting the translocation of NF-kappa B, p65 to nucleus by inhibiting phosphorylation of I kappa B-alpha in THP-1 macrophages. These data indicate that the sA beta(1-42) may play a dual role during inflammatory process, wherein, it may be involved in protecting the cells from inflammatory damage due to TNF-alpha. This ability of sA beta(1-42) might be playing some role in protecting the brain cells during the process of aging and Alzheimer's disease, where, chronic inflammatory environment plays a vital role.

AB Aging is linked with a thymic oxidative damage and some infectious diseases such as Chagas' disease may aggravate this process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the production of distinct cytokines as well as the antioxidant/oxidant status of the thymus and thymocytes populations during Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) infection. Young (5 weeks old) and aged (18 weeks old) male Wistar rats were inoculated with blood trypomastigotes forms of the Y strain of T. cruzi. On the 16th day after T. cruzi infection, increased concentrations of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), interleukin (IL)-12, IL-17 were detected in aged infected subjects as compared to young infected ones. Interestingly, a reduction in the production of tumor necrose factor (TNF)-alpha was observed in aged infected rats when compared to young infected subjects. Aged-infected rats presented increased O-2(-) levels, compared to young counterparts. Significant raise in the generation of O-2 in aged infected animals, as compared to uninfected counterparts was observed. Up-regulated expression of Nox2 in the thymus of young and aged infected animals was observed. An increased SOD2 expression was detected in the thymus of young animals infected with T. cruzi, when compared to uninfected young rats. Aged animals showed reduced thymus weight and the number of thymocytes. Decreased percentages of SPCD4(+) and SPCD8(+)T cells were detected in aged and control groups when compared to young counterparts. In summary, this is the first data to directly examine the influence of aging on age-related dysfunctions during the acute phase of experimental Chagas disease. Concerning to oxidative stress, it is clear from our analysis that aged infected rats suffer a more intense oxidative damage when compared to young and infected ones. Age and infection triggered a dynamic interplay of cytokines, oxidative stress and thymic dysfunctions which led to impaired response from aged and infected rats. Such findings may have significant functional relevance in therapeutic strategies in order to reestablish the thymic immunological function which occurs in aged and T. cruzi infected subjects.

AB HIV infection is associated with chronic inflammation in both non-treated and treated patients. TLR-dependent mechanisms are strongly involved in the maintenance of this inflammation. Indeed, the residual replication of HIV, the potential viral co-infections, or the products issued from microbial translocation provide TLR ligands, which contribute to trigger innate immune responses. Maintaining this chronic inflammation leads to an exhaustion of the immune system. Therefore, the TLR-dependent responses could be altered in HIV-infected patients. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed high-resolution phenotyping using a mass cytometry panel of 34 cell markers. Whole blood cells from healthy, non-treated HIV-infected and ART-treated HIV-infected subjects were stimulated with LPS, R848 or Poly(I:C). We observed the immune responses induced in T-cells, B-cells, polymorphonuclear cells, NK cells, basophils, monocytes and dendritic cells. We observed that, for either LPS or R848 stimulations, the production of cytokines in monocytes and conventional dendritic cells was delayed in treated or non-treated HIV-infected patients, compared to healthy individuals. These results suggest that leukocytes from chronic HIV-infected patients are slower to respond following the sensing of pathogens and danger signals, which may be an important feature of HIV infection.

AB Aims: The proarrhythmic effect of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) was observed in patients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD). However, there is no data on the role of FGF23 and soluble Klotho (sKlotho) in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF) beyond ESKD. The aim of the study was to assess the peripheral vein and left atrial (LA) serum levels of FGF23 and sKlotho along with calcium-phosphates parameters in patients with AF undergoing percutaneous radiofrequency pulmonary vein isolation (PVI).
   Methods and results: Sixty-nine consecutive patients (mean age: 55.8 +/- 9.7 years, F/M: 26/43, CHA2DS2-Vasc: 1.7 +/- 1.1) with paroxysmal/persistent AF undergoing PVI were included into the study. Blood samples were taken during PVI baseline from the peripheral vein, then from the LA immediately after a septal puncture.
   Results: There were significant differences in the concentrations of peripheral and LA serum sKlotho, intact FGF23 (iFGF23), calcium and phosphates; peripheral FGF23, calcium and phosphates levels were significantly higher, and sKlotho levels were significantly lower than the LA concentrations. Serum sKlotho levels correlated with the CHADS2-VASc score (r = 0.254, p = 0.034) and glucose level (r = 0.300, p = 0.005). Serum sKlotho gradient (LA - peripheral vein) correlated with the baseline AF burden in the Holter monitoring (r = -0.389, p = 0.003). PVI efficacy was confirmed in 52 (75%) patients. There was a significant difference in the iFGF23 gradient between patients with AF and without AF (80.3 vs. -47.6 pg/ml, p = 0.009) in the six-month follow-up. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that an iFGF23 gradient > 28.7 pg/ml (AUC = 0.742, p = 0.002) was a predictor for AF recurrence.
   Conclusions: There is a gradient between the LA and peripheral vein in the markers of calcium-phosphate metabolism in patients undergoing PVI. Lower sKlotho and higher iFGF23 serum levels are associated with episodes of AF. Serum iFGF23 gradient is a potent predictor for the recurrence of AF.

AB The immuno-inflammatory origin of schizophrenia in a subset of patients is viewed as a key element of an overarching etiological construct. Despite substantial research, the immune components exerting major effect are yet to be fully clarified. Disrupted T cell networks have consistently been linked to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Amongst the Th cell subsets, the Th17 cells have emerged as a paradigmatic lineage with significant functional implications in a vast number of immune mediated diseases including brain disorders such as schizophrenia.
   The present study was aimed at examining the functional role of the Th17 pathway in schizophrenia. To address this, genotyping of IL17A (rs2275913; G197A) Single Nucleotide Polymorphism was carried out by the PCR-RFLP method in 221 schizophrenia patients and 223 healthy control subjects. Gene expression of two transcription factors STAT3 and RORC was quantified in a subset of drug naive schizophrenia patients (n = 56) and healthy controls (n = 52) by TaqMan assay. The plasma levels of fifteen cytokines belonging to Th17 pathway were estimated in a subset of drug naive schizophrenia patients (n = 61) and healthy controls (n = 50) by using Bio-Plex Pro Human Th17 cytokine assays.
   The AA genotype was associated with higher total score of bizarre behaviour and apathy in female schizophrenia patients. A high gene expression level of RORC was observed in drug naive schizophrenia patients. In addition, significantly elevated plasma levels of IL-6 and IL-22, and reduced levels of IL-1 beta and IL-17F were noted in schizophrenia patients. Taken together, these findings indicate a dysregulated Th17 pathway in schizophrenia patients.

AB Purpose: Inflammation is a crucial but understudied mechanism of neuronal injury after hypoxia-ischemia. The aim was to identify a panel of cytokines involved in brain injury in neonates with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).
   Methods: Ten newborns with HIE undergoing to therapeutic hypothermia (TH, HIE Group) and 8 healthy newborns (CTRL Group) were enrolled. For the HIE group, 5 samples were collected: between 0 and 6 h of life (time 1), 12 h (time 2), 24 h (time 3), 48 h (time 4) and 96 h of life (time 5). For the CTRL group, one sample was collected. A panel of 48 inflammatory cytokines was determined in all samples. Data were analyzed using multivariate statistical analysis (Principal component analysis, PCA)
   Results: 17 cytokines, among 48 analyzed, were found to be significantly different, initially, between the CTRL and HIE groups: 12 with reported pro-inflammatory effects and 5 with reported anti-inflammatory effects. In the HIE group cytokines showed a decreasing trend during the TH and at the end of treatment comparable to the CTRL group. IL-18 did demonstrate a slight increase at time 3 during HT but decreased steadily at sampling times, 4 and 5.
   Conclusions: Our data demonstrates that many pathways of the inflammatory cascade are activated following hypoxic-ischemic injury. This information will increase our understanding of changes in cytokines over time in neonates with HIE undergoing TH.

AB Background: Members of TNF alpha superfamily, A proliferation inducing ligand (APRIL), B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and Transmembrane activator and calcium cyclophylin interactor (TACI) are main regulators of B-cell function. The aim of this study was to evaluate concentrations of APRIL, BAFF and soluble TACI (sTACI) receptor in septic patients compared to healthy controls and compare concentrations of these biomarkers depending on sepsis severity and outcome.
   Materials and methods: A total of 115 septic patients and 30 healthy volunteers were included and concentrations of APRIL, BAFF and sTACI were determined in all subjects at the admission (ELISA R&D Systems tests). Concentrations of these biomarkers in function of sepsis severity (sepsis n = 94 and septic shock n = 21) and outcome (lethal n = 40, recovery n = 75) were tested, as well as correlations with APACHE II and SOFA scores, immunoglobulins, complement, PCT and CRP concentrations.
   Results: Concentrations of all three biomarkers were significantly increased in septic patients compared to controls (AUC(APRIL) = 0.982, AUC(BAFF) = 0.873, AUC(sTACI) = 0.683). Higher concentrations of APRIL and sTACI (p = 0.033, p = 0.037), and lower concentrations of BAFF (p = 0.005) were observed in patients with septic shock compared to sepsis. BAFF concentrations correlated positively with IgM, C3 and C4 levels. sTACI and APRIL were shown to be predictors of lethal outcome (p = 0.003, p = 0.049).
   Conclusions: Concentrations of observed TNFa superfamily members are significantly increased in septic patients, confirming their role in sepsis pathogenesis. Higher concentrations of anti-inflammatory sTACI receptor correlated with severity of sepsis and poorer prognosis, thus potentially indicating domination of anti-inflammatory response in septic patients with worse outcome.

AB Leishmania proteins have been evaluated as vaccine candidates against leishmaniasis; however, most antigens present low immunogenicity and need to be added with immune adjuvants. A low number of licensed adjuvants exist on the market today; therefore, research conducted to produce new products is desirable. The present study sought to evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a recombinant Leishmania hypothetical protein, namely LiHyR, administered with saponin or liposomes in BALB/c mice. Immunological and parasitological parameters were evaluated, and results showed significant protection against Leishmania infantum infection produced by both compositions in the immunized animals; however, this was not identified when the antigen was used alone. In addition, the liposomal formulation was more effective in inducing a polarized Th1 response in the vaccinated animals, which was maintained after challenge and reflected by lower parasitism found in all evaluated organs when the limiting dilution technique and RT-PCR assay were employed. The protected animals showed higher levels of protein and parasite-specific IFN-gamma IL-2, IL-12, GM-CSF, and TNF-alpha, which were evaluated by capture ELISA and flow cytometry, in addition to a higher production of anti-protein and anti-parasite IgG2a antibodies, both before and after challenge. The Lip/rLiHyR combination induced higher IFN-gamma production through both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell subtypes. Results indicate the possibility of using the LiHyR, containing a liposomal formulation, as a vaccine candidate against visceral leishmaniasis.

AB Syndecan-1 (SDC-1) is a transmembrane member that has a profound influence on the resolution of inflammation. Soluble syndecan-1 (sSDC-1) levels have been shown to increase in many inflammatory diseases. However, it remains unknown whether sSDC-1 concentration is elevated in neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The aims of this pilot study were to investigate the relationship between sSDC-1 and disease severity in NMO and MS and whether sSDC-1 has potential as an effective marker for disease severity. We measured sSDC-1 concentrations by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). NMO patients had significantly higher CSF sSDC-1 levels than MS patients or controls. We also found a positive correlation between the increased CSF sSDC-1 levels and increased severity in NMO disease, but not in MS. In NMO, CSF sSDC-1 concentrations were positively correlated with CSF interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and IL-17. Overall, we showed levels of CSF sSDC-1 were higher in NMO patients and had a positive relationship with disease severity of NMO but not with MS. CSF sSDC-1 may be an effective marker of NMO disease severity.

AB Interleukin 33 (IL33) is a cytokine found in the extracellular space (mature 1L33) or in the cell nucleus (full-length IL33). Nuclear accumulation of IL33 has been reported in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) during intestinal inflammation and cancer, but a functional role for this nuclear form remains unclear. To study the role of nuclear IL33 in IEC, we generated transgenic mice expressing full-length IL33 in the intestinal epithelium (Vfl33 mice). Expression of full-length IL33 in the epithelium resulted in accumulation of IL33 protein in the nucleus and secretion of IL33. Over-expression of full-length IL33 by IEC did not promote gut inflammation, but induced expression of genes in the IEC and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) that correlated negatively with genes expressed in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Because the IL33 receptor ST2 is expressed by IEC, there was the potential that both the mature and full-length forms could mediate this effect. To specifically interrogate the transcriptional role of nuclear IL33, we intercrossed the Vfl33 mice with ST2- deficient mice. ST2 deficiency completely abrogated the transcriptional effects elicited by IL33 expression, suggesting that the transcriptional effects of IL33 on IEC are mediated by its mature, not its nuclear form.

AB Secondary bacterial infection contributes to severe inflammation following viral infection. Among foodborne pathogenic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus is known to exacerbate severe inflammatory responses after infection with single-stranded RNA viruses such as influenza viruses. However, it has not been determined if S. aureus infection enhances inflammatory responses after infection with RNA enteric viruses, including rotavirus, which is a double-stranded RNA virus. We therefore investigated the molecular mechanisms by which a cell wall component of S. aureus enhanced inflammatory responses during enteric viral infection using poly I:C-primed macrophages, which is a well-established model for double-stranded RNA virus infection. S. aureus lipoproteins enhanced IL-6 as well as TNF-alpha production in poly I:C-primed macrophages. Pam2CSK4, a mimic of Gram-positive bacterial lipoproteins and S. aureus lipoproteins, also significantly enhanced IL-6 production in poly I:C-primed macrophages. While IFN-beta expression was increased in poly I:C-primed macrophages treated with Pam2CSK4 or S. aureus lipoproteins, the level of IL-6 enhancement in poly I:C-primed macrophages was decreased in the presence of anti-IFN-alpha/beta receptor antibody, suggesting that IFN-beta plays an important role in enhanced IL-6 production. Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, Akt, ERK and NF-kappa B were also involved in the enhanced IL-6 production. Collectively, these results suggest that S. aureus lipoproteins induce excessive inflammatory responses in the presence of poly I:C.

AB Background: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most common respiratory diseases in children. It is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Moderate-to-severe AR decreases the quality of life and social performance in children.
   Objective: To investigate whether polymorphisms in previously published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) allergic disease loci are associated with childhood AR and the severity of AR symptoms in a Chinese Han population.
   Methods: A case-control study was conducted in 503 pediatric patients with AR and 393 control Chinese school-aged subjects. AR severity was classified as mild or moderate-to-severe according to the AR and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) guidelines. Overall, 16 tagged single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of published GWAS associations with allergic diseases were selected. All subjects were genotyped and analyzed for the 16 selected tSNPs using the improved multiplex ligation detection reaction (iMLDR) technique.
   Results: Both rs7130588_AG and rs7927894_CT genotypes in EMSY region were associated with a significantly increased risk of AR (1.75-fold and 1.50-fold) compared to the AA and CC genotypes, respectively, specific to moderate-to-severe AR. The difference of rs7130588 genotypes in cases vs. controls was still statistically significant under the additive model after multiple test correction to adjust the false discovery rate (FDR) with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.818 and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.240-2.664 (P-FDR = 0.0349). The rs7130588_G allele was only associated with a high risk of moderate-to-severe AR (1.85-fold, P-age and gender_adjustment = 0.003). The rs2227284_TG genotype at the IL4 locus was significantly associated with a 0.65-fold decreased risk of AR compared to the TT genotype. The protective effect of the rs2227284_G allele was also found in different severity of AR. Haplotype analysis showed a significantly increased AR risk associated with the haplotype G-T-T (rs7130588-rs2155219-rs7927894) and a protective effect with the haplotype C-G-C (rs2243250-rs2227284-s2243290).
   Conclusions: The loci in EMSY and IL4 can be considered as a hereditary marker for childhood AR. The rs7130588_G allele seems to predispose only to moderate-to-severe AR, though other mechanisms are also likely to be involved.

AB The network of cytokines consists one of the most extensively studied signaling systems of human body. Cytokines appear to modulate pathogenesis and progress of many different diseases in the human body, particularly in regards to cardiovascular system. However, their effects on the electrical system of the heart has been neglected. Over the past decade, attemps to understand this relationship led to the uncovering of the direct and indirect effects of cytokines on action potential propagation and cell depolarization. This relationship has been depicted in clinical practice as serum levels of cytokines are increasingly associated with prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias either isolated or secondary to either a heart condition or a systemic auto-immune disease. Thus, they present an appealing potential as a biomarker for prediction of arrhythmia generation, as well as the ourtcome of electrophysiological interventions.

AB The hybrid training system (HTS) is a special and compact system for effective skeletal muscle training by a combined application of volitional and electrical muscle contraction. Lower limbs' muscle training using HTS has been reported to increase not only muscle strength but also plasma interleukin-6 levels; however, little is known in other cytokines. In this study, we measured 52 cytokines and creatine phosphokinase-MM in the serum of 16 healthy men before and after lower limbs' muscle training by the knee flexion and extension using HTS. Skeletal muscle volume-corrected serum concentrations of cutaneous T-cell-attracting chemokine, erythropoietin, and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand increased immediately after the training. These increased cytokines have been reported to play important roles in wound healing, neuroprotection, and cardiovascular protection.

AB Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis cause significant physical and psychological burdens for afflicted individuals. An accelerated TNF-alpha/IL-23/IL-17 axis is their major pathomechanism; therefore, anti-TNF-alpha/IL-23/IL-17 biologics are very effective for the treatment of skin and joint lesions in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Given that the IL-17 signature is more upregulated in the skin than in synovium in psoriatic arthritis, anti-IL-23/IL-17 agents seem to be superior to anti-TNF-alpha remedies in the treatment of skin lesions. In this review, we focus on the differential efficacy of anti-TNF-alpha/IL-23/IL-17 biologics in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.

AB Objective: Cytokines release by adipocytes could interact with TSH secretion. We evaluated the relationship between adipocytokines and TSH. We further tested for association of cytokines and thyroid autoimmunity.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a community-based sample including 5385 individuals (2964 female) with TSH within the reference range. Subjects who reported taking thyroid medications or drugs that alter thyroid function were excluded. TSH, FT4, adiponectin, leptin, antibody against thyroperoxidase and against thyroglobulin were measured. Linear and logistic regression models were used to test for association.
   Results: Females had higher adiponectin and leptin level and increased frequency of thyroid antibodies. In multiple regression analysis TSH was directly associated with leptin (beta = 0.003, p = 0.001) and the presence of circulating antibody against thyroperoxidase (beta = 0.315, p < 0.001), but negatively associated with age (beta = -0.012, p < 0.001) and FT4 (beta = -0.359, p < 0.001). Adiponectin, the presence of antibody against thyroglobulin and smoking habit were not associated with TSH levels (p = 0.223, p = 0.174 and p = 0.788, respectively). Logistic regression analysis revealed that higher adiponectin levels were associated with thyroid autoimmunity.
   Conclusions: Leptin is positively associated with TSH levels in euthyroid individuals, suggesting an effect of the adipokine on TSH secretion. Our results support the hypothesis that the leptin and pituitary-thyroid axis might interact in the context of energy homeostasis. The effect of adiponectin on thyroid autoimmunity will require more studies.

AB Formation of macrophage-derived foam cells may mark the initial stages of atherosclerosis. We investigated the association between the expression of the leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (LAIR-1) in macrophages and foam cell formation. A foam cell model was established by incubating THP-1-derived macrophages and bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). The role of LAIR-1 in foam cell formation was evaluated via Oil Red O staining and Dil-ox-LDL fluorescence intensities. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), cholesterol metabolism-related genes, and the role of LAIR-1 in activating classically activated (M1) and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages were evaluated by qPCR. Additionally, activation of protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) and cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) were detected by western blotting. Results indicated that silencing LAIR-1 in macrophages modulated the SHP-1/CREB/PPAR gamma pathway, thereby promoting M2 macrophage polarization and increasing foam cell formation. Therefore, Inhibition of LAIR-1 in macrophages may promote foam cell formation and atherosclerosis.

AB All type I interferons share structural homology and bind to a common heterodimeric receptor consisting of the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 subunits, which are expressed on most cell types. Although binding to the same receptor pair, they evoke a broad range of activities within the cell affecting the expression of numerous genes and resulting in profound cellular changes. Differential activation results from multiple levels of cellular and molecular events including binding affinity, receptor density, cell type-specific variations, and post-translational modification of signaling molecules downstream. Within the type I interferon family the Asn-Gly-Arg (NGR) sequence motif is unique to interferon-beta and, together with its deamidated variants Asp-Gly-Arg (DGR) and iso-Asp-Gly-Arg (iso-DGR), imparts additional binding specificities that go beyond that of the canonical IFNAR1/IFNAR2. These warrant further investigations and functional studies and may eventually shed new light on differential effects observed for this molecule in oncology and autoimmune diseases.

AB The balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory macrophage generation, a process known as polarization, is critical for immune homoeostasis. Identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying polarization and the generation of anti-inflammatory macrophages is an area of high current interest. Our previous work has demonstrated that integrin CD11b promotes IL-10 production in macrophages by activating the Sarcoma gene (Src), yet whether and how Src modulates anti-inflammatory macrophages is not known. Here we show that Src inhibitor (Dasatinib)-treated mice were highly susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, with a much more sever inflammation response, accompanying by high TNF-alpha, and low IL-10 expression. Inhibition of Src enhanced the expression of pro-inflammatory macrophage marker inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), but reduced the expression of anti-inflammatory macrophage marker arginase1 (Arg1) in both intestinal macrophages and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Overexpression of constitutively activated Src promoted IL-4-induced expression of Arg1 through STAT6 phosphorylation, and Jak1 was also involved in this process. Our results reveal that the IL-4-Src-STAT6 pathway plays a major role in polarizing anti-inflammatory macrophage generation and suggest a potential anti-inflammatory role for Src in inflammatory diseases.

AB Kawasaki disease is a multi-system vasculitis and a primary cause of acquired heart disease among children. Genetic factors may increase susceptibility to Kawasaki disease. TBXA2R is a G-protein-coupled receptor that participates in tissue inflammation and is associated with susceptibility to several diseases, but its relevance in Kawasaki disease is unclear. We genotyped TBXA2R (rs1131882 and rs4523) in 694 Kawasaki disease cases and 657 healthy controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the intensity of the associations. We found a significantly decreased risk of Kawasaki disease associated with TBXA2R rs4523 G variant genotypes (AG vs AA: adjusted OR = 0.788, 95%CI = 0.626-0.993; GG vs AA: adjusted OR = 0.459, 95%CI = 0.258-0.815; AG/GG vs AA: adjusted OR = 0.744, 95%CI = 0.595-0.929; GG vs AG/AA: adjusted OR = 0.497, 95% CI = 0.281-0.879). In the combined analysis of the two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we found that individuals with two unfavorable genotypes exhibited decreased risk for Kawasaki disease (adjusted OR = 0.754, 95%CI = 0.577-0.985) compared with those who did not have or one unfavorable genotypes. This cumulative effect on protection is effect-genotype dose-dependent (n(trend) = 0.022). Moreover, the combined analysis indicated that the two unfavorable genotypes were associated with a decreased risk of Kawasaki disease in children 12-60 months of age, females and the subgroup with non-coronary artery lesion (NCAL) formation compared with those who did not have or one unfavorable genotypes. In conclusion, the TBXA2R rs4523 G allele may contribute to protection against Kawasaki disease and decreased risk of coronary artery aneurysm complications in a southern Chinese population.

AB The endometrium lines a women's uterus becoming receptive, and allowing embryo implantation to occur, for just a few days during the post-ovulatory mid-secretory phase of each menstrual cycle. We investigated whether concentrations of proposed receptivity biomarkers (VEGF, IL8, FGF2, CSF3 sFlt-1, sGP130 and PlGF) secreted by the endometrium into the uterine cavity and forming the microenvironment for embryo implantation is altered among a population of age-matched women with unexplained (idiopathic) infertility compared to fertile women during the receptive mid-secretory phase (n = 16 fertile, 18 infertile) and the prior pre-receptive early secretory phase (n = 19 fertile, 18 infertile) of their cycle.
   In the mid-secretory cohort significantly elevated concentrations of five biomarkers; PIGF (p = 0.001), IL8 (p = 0.004), sGP130 (p = 0.009), sFlt-1 (p = 0.021), and CSF3 (p = 0.029) was present in uterine fluid of infertile women during the mid-secretory phase, but only CSF3 was significantly elevated in the pre-receptive early secretory phase (p = 0.006). In vitro studies of glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms of CSF3 at representative fertile (20 ng/mL) and infertile (70 ng/mL) effects on endometrium and embryo behaviour were performed.
   Non-glycosylated CSF3 at fertile concentrations significantly (p < 0.001) elevated endometrial epithelial cell proliferation however chronic treatment or elevated (infertile) concentrations of CSF3 in glycosylated form abrogated the positive effects. Both forms of CSF3 increased trophoblast cell invasion (p < 0.001) regardless of concentration. Mouse embryo outgrowth was significantly (p < 0.01) increased at fertile but not at infertile concentrations.
   The study confirmed potential utility of five biomarkers of endometrial receptivity for future application in the mid-secretory phase while highlighting CSF3 is elevated in the earlier pre-receptive phase. Our data provides evidence that CSF3 acts on both human endometrium and embryo in a manner that is concentration and glycosylation dependent.

AB Background: Recently, the roles of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and IL-10 gene polymorphisms in gastric cancer have been extensively studied, with conflicting results. Therefore, we conducted the present study to better assess the potential correlations between these interleukin gene polymorphisms and gastric cancer.
   Methods: Eligible articles were searched in PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of Science and CNKI. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (Cls) were used to detect any potential associations between interleukin gene polymorphisms and the risk of gastric cancer.
   Results: A total of 73 case-control studies were finally included. Significant associations with the risk of gastric cancer were only detected for the IL-8 rs4073 polymorphism in overall analyses. Further subgroup analyses according to ethnicity of participants revealed that the IL-6 rs1800796, IL-8 rs4073, IL-10 rs1800871, IL-10 rs1800872 and IL-10 rs1800896 polymorphisms were all significantly associated with the risk of gastric cancer in Asians. No positive results were found for any investigated interleukin gene polymorphisms in Caucasians.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that IL-6 rs1800796, IL-8 rs4073, IL-10 rs1800871, IL-10 rs1800872 and IL-10 rs1800896 polymorphisms may serve as genetic biomarkers of gastric cancer in Asians.

AB Background & Aims: Gut ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury is a life-threatening condition. The immune response plays an important role in I/R-induced organ injury. Alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) is a potent natural killer T (NKT) cell stimulator. Activation of NKT cells by alpha-GalCer has been shown to reduce I/R-induced injury in the liver and heart. However, whether alpha-GalCer has any protective effects on gut I/R-induced organ injury remained unknown. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that alpha-GalCer attenuates gut I/R-induced local and remote organ injury through modulating immune responses.
   Methods: Gut ischemia was induced by placing a microvascular clip across the superior mesenteric artery for 30 min in male adult mice. After removing the clip, alpha-GalCer (2 mu g/mouse) or normal saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 (Vehicle) was administered intraperitoneally. Blood, gut, lung and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) samples were collected 4 h after reperfusion to detect bacterial translocation, tight junction protein, tissue damage, edema, apoptosis, IL-4, IL-10, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha levels.
   Results: alpha-GalCer significantly reduced bacterial translocation to the MLN, restored tight junction protein and attenuated gut and lung injury after gut I/R. alpha-GalCer markedly stimulated the production of IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-gamma, but had no obvious effects on TNF-alpha production in gut I/R mice. Pretreatment with anti-CD1d, IL-4 or IL-10, but not IFN-gamma blocking antibodies abolished the protective effects of alpha-GalCer in gut I/R.
   Conclusions: alpha-GalCer treatment improved gut barrier function and attenuated gut and lung injury after gut I/R. The beneficial effects of alpha-GalCer in gut I/R were NKT cell dependent and mediated through upregulation of IL-4 and IL-10. Thus, activation of NKT cells by alpha-GalCer may serve as a novel option in the treatment of gut I/R injury.

AB Pneumococcal meningitis, caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, is the most common type of bacterial meningitis. The clinical management of this disease has been challenged by the emergence of multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, requiring the urgent development of new therapeutic alternatives. Over the course of bacterial meningitis, pathogen invasion is accompanied by a massive recruitment of peripheral immune cells, especially neutrophil granulocytes, which are recruited under the coordination of several cytokines and chemokines. Here, we used chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (Ccl3)-deficient mice to investigate the functional role of CCL3 in a mouse model of pneumococcal meningitis.
   Following intrathecal infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae Ccl3-deficient mice presented a significantly shorter survival and higher bacterial load than wildtype mice, paralleled by an ameliorated infiltration of neutrophil granulocytes into the CNS. Blood sample analysis revealed that infected Ccl3-deficient mice showed a significant decrease in erythrocytes, hemoglobin and hematocrit as well as in the number of banded neutrophils. Moreover, infected Ccl3-deficient mice showed an altered cytokine expression profile. Glial cell activation remained unchanged in both genotypes.
   In summary, this study demonstrates that CCL3 is beneficial in Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced meningitis. Pharmacological modulation of the CCL3 pathways might, therefore, represent a future therapeutic option to manage Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis.

AB Zika virus (ZIKV) has caused substantial concern worldwide owing to its association with severe birth defects, such as microcephaly and other congenital malformations. Inflammasomes, i.e., multi-protein complexes that induce inflammation and pyroptosis, are predicted to contribute to the immune response to this flavivirus. Accordingly, in this study, the in situ inflammasome response was evaluated in fatal cases of ZIKV-linked microcephaly. Brain tissue samples were collected from eight babies, including four ZIKV-positive microcephalic neonates who died after birth and four flavivirus-negative neonatal controls who died of other causes and whose central nervous system (CNS) architecture was preserved. In the ZIKV-positive newborn/stillbirth babies, the major histopathological alterations included atrophy of the cortical layer, a predominance of mononuclear cell infiltration in the Virchow Robin space, neuronal necrosis, vacuolization and neuronal degeneration, neuronophagy, and gliosis. An immunohistochemical analysis of tissues in the neural parenchyma showed significantly higher expression of the receptors NLRP1, NLRP3, and AIM2, cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-18, and IL-33, and enzymes caspase 1, iNOS, and arginase 1 in ZIKV-positive microcephaly cases than in flavivirus-negative controls. These results suggest that inflammasome activation can aggravate the neuroinflammatory response and consequently increase CNS damage in neonates with fetal neural ZIKV infection and microcephaly.

AB Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common type of cancer in children worldwide, has one of the highest incidence rates in Mexico. It is a multifactorial disease and different cytokine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), have been associated with ALL expression. Few studies have been published analyzing IFNG + 874 T/A and IL2 -330 G/T in this type of leukemia. These SNPs are involved in high or low expression, and are central to cellular immunity, influencing greatly tumor growth. The purpose of this work was to explore the association of IFNG + 874 A/T (rs2430561) and IL2-330 G/T (rs2069762) SNPs with ALL susceptibility and/or protection in 488 Mexican Mestizos patients, as compared to 950 Mexican Mestizo healthy controls. The results demonstrated that IFNG + 874T allele (pc = 0.00004, OR = 0.673) and the TT genotype (pc = 0.00015, OR = 0.349), protect against ALL expression with no specific gender association; however, the TT homozygote genotype (vs. TA + AA) seems more protective in males (pc = 0.00683). IL2-330 G/T does not contribute to the development of ALL. In healthy Mexicans, the most common genotypes for IL2 and IFNG, are the low cytokine producers, suggesting that the genetic background in this ethnic group, may be partly responsible for the high incidence of ALL. These results show for the first time in Mexicans, the relevant role that IFNG SNP has in the genetic etiology of ALL. Thus, a large group of patients belonging to different ethnicities will be very helpful to study in order to demonstrate if these SNPs contribute to the genetic etiology of ALL, as shown here in Mexican Mestizos.

AB The establishment of latent HIV-1 reservoirs in terminally differentiated cells represents a major impediment to the success of antiretroviral therapies. Notably, macrophages (M phi s) are susceptible to HIV-1 infection and recent evidence suggests that they may be involved in long-term HIV-1 persistence. While the extensive functional heterogeneity seen across the M phi cell lineage parallels the spectrum of HIV-1 susceptibility reported across these cell subsets, the facets of M phi HIV-1 resistance and susceptibility remain to be fully defined. Notably, the differentiation of most M phi subsets depends on signaling through the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR), which in addition to M-CSF, is now known to bind the unrelated interleukin-34 (IL-34) cytokine. The biological need for two M-CSFR ligands awaits full elucidation. Here, we report that M phi s differentiated from human peripheral blood monocytes with IL-34 are substantially more resistant to HIV-1 infection than M-CSF-derived M phi s. Moreover, while both M phi subsets express comparable surface protein levels of the HIV-1 receptor and co-receptor, CD4 and CCR5 respectively, the IL-34-M phi s express significantly greater levels of pertinent restriction factor genes, potentially accounting for their greater resistance to HIV-1 infection than that observed in M-CSF-M phi s. Together, our findings underline previously unexplored differentiation pathways resulting in HIV-1-susceptible and resistant M phi subsets and pave the way for further research that may overcome one of the last major hurdles in developing more successful antiretroviral therapy.

   Methods: Studies related to TNF-alpha-308G/A and PE risk were retrieved from PubMed, the Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang, CBM, VIP Database. The odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to estimate the association between the TNF-alpha-308G/A polymorphism and susceptibility to PE under the models of allelic contrast (A vs. G), recessive (AA vs. AG + GG), dominant (AA + AG vs. GG), and co-dominant (AA vs. GG).
   Results: 22 studies (including 2459 cases and 4246 controls) were included in the meta-analysis. The overall analysis indicated that the significant association between TNF-alpha-308G/A polymorphism and susceptibility to pre-eclampsia existed in allele model (A vs. G: OR = 1.37, 95%CI: 1.06-1.77), but not in dominant model, recessive model, and co-dominant model. In subgroup analysis by ethnicity, pre-pregnancy BMI and pregnancy parity, the results showed the significant association between TNF-alpha-308G/A polymorphism and the risk of PE was obvious in Caucasian (A vs. G: OR = 1.36, 95%CI: 1.13-1.64; AA vs. GG: OR = 1.71, 95%CI: 1.03-2.86; AA + AG vs. GG: OR = 1.32, 95%CI: 1.03-1.71), Iranian (A vs. G: OR = 4.28, 95%CI: 2.01-9.11), and primipara (A vs. G: OR = 1.49, 95%CI: 1.15-1.92; AA vs. GG: OR = 2.15, 95%CI: 1.10-4.21).
   Conclusion: Current evidence demonstrates that carriers of TNF-alpha (308A) allele would increase the susceptibility to PE, especially among Caucasian, Iranian and primipara.

AB Angiogenesis is fundamental to normal placental development, and aberrant angiogenesis contributes substantially to placental pathologies. Placental angiogenesis is a pivotal process that plays a key mechanistic role in the elaboration of the placental villous tree, which is mainly taken by human placental microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs), present in the fetal capillaries of chorionic villi, and macrovascular human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) also play a role in this process. These are the two types of endothelial cells that form the placenta and differ in morphology and function. The placental vasculature represents a distinct territory that is highly specialized in structure and function. To distinguish the differences between HPMECs and HUVECs, we isolated HPMECs by paramagnetic particle separation and HUVECs through trypsinization and validated their characteristics. Then, we examined their response to fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endocrine-gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF), as well as the underlying signaling mechanisms and their transcriptomes. We found that cultured HPMECs and HUVECs took up DiI-Ac-LDL and formed capillary-like tube structures on Matrigel. HPMECs and HUVECs had different expressions of eNOS, PROKR1 and PROKR2, and these characteristics substantiate the endothelial nature of cultured cells. FGF2 and VEGF stimulated the proliferation and migration of HPMECs and HUVECs via activation of PI3K/AKT1 and MEK1/MEK2/ERK1/ERK2. Interestingly, EG-VEGF increased the proliferation and migration of HPMECs via only MEK1/MEK2/ERK1/ERK2 and not PI3K/AKT1. Microarray analysis showed that there were some differentially expressed genes between HPMECs and HUVECs. Gene ontology analysis indicated that the differentially expressed genes were highly related to G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, angiogenesis, L-lysine transmembrane transport and blood vessel remodeling. These data provided evidence of heterogeneity between microvascular HPMECs and macrovascular HUVECs that most likely reflected significant differences in endothelial cell function in the two different cellular environments.

AB Hepcidin, a liver-derived hormone, negatively regulates circulating iron levels through an increase in its expression in response to iron overload. Inflammation also increases production of hepcidin, potentially leading to inflammatory anemia. We previously revealed that proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 beta increased hepcidin expression through its transcriptional stimulation in hepatocytes. Induction of CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) delta and IL-6 in response to IL-1 beta treatment stimulated hepcidin transcription via the C/EBP-binding site (C/EBP-BS) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-BS on the hepcidin promoter, respectively. Here, we show an additional pathway responsible for IL-1 beta-induced hepcidin transcription. IL-1 beta stimulated phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and its substrates c-Jun and JunB. SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, blocked IL-1 beta-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun and JunB as well as IL-1 beta-induced expression and transcription of hepcidin. Reporter assays for hepcidin transcription revealed that reporters with mutations of cAMP response element (CRE) site B, a putative Jun binding element, decreased responsiveness to IL-1 beta, and that activated JunB, but not c-Jun, conferred IL-1 beta-induced hepcidin transcription. Furthermore, binding of JunB to hepcidin promoter was increased by IL-1 beta. The present study indicated that IL-1 beta activates JNK and subsequently stimulates JunB activation, leading to hepcidin transcription via CRE site B on the hepcidin promoter. The present experiment provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying induction of hepcidin by inflammation and alteration of iron homeostasis.

AB The aim of this study was to examine whether cytokines and chemokines expressed in the uterine mucosa play a role in the process of eggshell formation in the chicken uterus. Changes in the expression levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the uterine mucosa during an ovulatory cycle (experiment 1) and effects of aging on their expression (experiment 2) were examined. In experiment 1, the expression of the pro inflammatory cytokines IL1 beta, IL6, TNFSF15, and IFN gamma, and a chemokine CX3CL1 was found to increase during eggshell biomineralization (16 h following oviposition), while anti-inflammatory TGF beta 2 expression was found to increase at 4 h following oviposition. In experiment 2, a higher expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokines TGF beta 2 and TGF beta 3, and chemokines CXCLi2 and CX3CL1, was observed in aged hens than in young hens. A significantly higher number of macrophages and CD8 + T cells were observed in the uterine tissue of aged hens than in young hens. Furthermore, the expression of adhesion molecules associated with leukocytic infiltration was found to be higher in aged hens than in young hens. We conclude that the eggshell formation process may be affected by the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The balanced expressions of these molecules might be disrupted in aged hens.

AB Hospital infections allied to bacterial resistance to antibiotics have become a major worldwide problem. In this context, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are presented as an alternative in the control of these resistant organisms. Besides antimicrobial effects, these molecules play a crucial role in immunity by acting as immunomodulators. These peptides can activate inflammatory cells to produce pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. In this study we will show the activity against multi-drug resistant bacteria (MDRB) of two cathelicidins from South American pit vipers Bothrops atrox and Crotalus durissus temficus, named batroxicidin and crotalicidin. It was observed that both peptides showed activity against MDRB and presented no hemolytic or cytotoxic activity. In addition, the ability of peptides to modulate the production of cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-10 and IL-6 was analyzed using Raw 264.7 cells in the presence of IFN-gamma stimuli, and multi-resistant E. colt and K. pneumoniae antigens. An up-expression or down-expression of TNF-alpha, as well as the IL-10 mediator, was observed. The cytokine IL-6, on the other hand, presented only a down-regulation for Raw 264.7 cell groups. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that both peptides presented a predominantly proinflammatory characteristic to the inflammatory mediators dosed. Overall, even presenting a proinflammatory characteristic, these peptides are still promising for future research and development of new potential antimicrobial molecules.

AB The immune regulatory properties of IL-33 have indicated that this cytokine has the capacity to target several immune cells under a variety of immunological responses, including overt inflammation and tolerance. Due to its versatile mechanistics, we sought to investigate the role of IL-33 on mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), a population of cells with recognizable modulatory functions. Our data indicates that IL-33 does not affect the expression of classical MSC markers such as CD29, CD44 and CD73, or the lack of CD45, CD11 b and CD117. Also, we found that IL-33 greatly induces iNOS expression and stimulates the secretion of TGF-beta and IL-6. Next, we decided to test IFN-gamma/IL-33-treated MSC using a skin transplantation model. Our data indicate that allogeneic skin-grafted animals treated with IFN-gamma/IL-33-modulated MSC reject as controls. Complementing this finding, we observed that ex vivo re-stimulated draining lymph nodes (dLN) cells from these mice secrete lower amounts of IFN-gamma and a slightly higher amount of IL-17. Beside a reduction in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells number, we preliminarily found an increment in the frequencies of CD4 + Foxp3 + IL-17 + T cells. Altogether, our data propose that IL-33 and IFN-gamma modulate MSC phenotype and function, most likely targeting Th1/Th17 axis.

AB TRAF family member-associated NF-kappa B activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) serves as hub molecule at the crossroad of multiple signaling pathways of type I interferon (IFN) induction. The importance of TBK1 in innate immunity has been demonstrated in mammalian, however the characterization and function of TBK1 in avian remains largely unknown. In this study, we cloned duck TBK1 (duTBK1) from duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) for the first time, which encoded 729 amino acids and had a high amino acid identity with goose and cormorant TBK1s. The duTBK1 showed a diffuse cytoplasmic localization in DEFs and was extensively expressed in all tested tissues. Overexpression of duTBK1 induced IFN-beta production through the activation of IRF1 and NF-kappa B in DEFs. The N-terminal kinase domain and the ubiquitin-like domain in middle of duTBK1 played pivotal roles in IFN-beta induction as well as in IRF1 and NF-kappa B activation. Furthermore, knockdown of duTBK1 by small interfering RNA significantly decreased poly(I:C)- or Sendai virus (SeV)-induced IFN-beta expression. In addition, duTBK1 expression dramatically reduced the replication of both duck reovirus (DRV) and duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV) in DEFs. These results suggested that the duTBK1 played a pivotal role in mediating duck antiviral innate immunity.

AB Background: Unregulated inflammatory and thrombotic responses have been proposed to be important causes of early brain injury and worse clinical outcomes after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
   Objective: We hypothesize that SAH is characterized by an increased inflammatory and thrombotic state and disruption of associations between these states.
   Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of 60 patients with SAH. 23 patients with unruptured aneurysms (UA) and 77 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) were chosen as controls. Plasma cytokine levels were measured using a 41-plex human immunoassay kit, and cytokine patterns associated with SAH, UA and TBI were identified using statistical and informatics methods.
   Results: SAH was characterized by an increase in several cytokines and chemokines, platelet-derived factors, and growth factors. Cluster analysis identified several cytokine clusters common in SAH, UA and TBI groups - generally grouped as platelet-derived, vascular and pro-inflammatory clusters. In the UA group, the platelet derived cluster had an inverse relationship with the inflammatory cluster which was absent in SAH. Additionally, a cluster comprising of growth and colony stimulating factors was unique to SAH.
   Conclusions: A cluster of cytokines involved in growth and colony stimulation was unique to SAH. Negative associations between the thrombotic and inflammatory molecules were observed in UA but not in SAH. Further studies to examine the pathophysiology behind the cluster unique to SAH and the associations between the thrombotic and inflammatory cytokines are required.

AB Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a common complication of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is a significant risk factor for hospitalization and shortened life expectancy. Therefore, developing new serum biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis of COPD associated PH is crucial. In the present study, a solid-phase antibody array simultaneously detecting multiple proteins was used to search specific COPD associated PH biomarkers, with COPD patients and healthy subjects as control groups. As a result, compared to the COPD and healthy groups, the levels of MCP-4, SDF-1 alpha, CCL28, Adipsin, IL-28A, CD40 and AgRP were uniquely altered in COPD patient serum with pulmonary hypertension. Among these proteins, CCL28, MCP-4, CD40, AgRP and IL-28A were identified to be differentially expressed in COPD patients with hypertension, indicating that these cytokines may serve as novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of COPD associated pulmonary hypertension.

AB Anacardic acid, which is abundant in nutshell of Anacardium occidentale, has multiple pharmacological activities. In this study, we examined the therapeutic potential of anacardic acid in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We explored the effects of anacardic acid on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice and on the proliferation and invasion of RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs). The underlying molecular mechanism was investigated. Anacardic acid treatment markedly suppressed paw swelling, joint destruction, and arthritis scores in CIA mice. The serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- alpha) and interleutkin-1beta 1 beta) were significantly lowered by anacardic acid. In vitro assays demonstrated that anacardic acid impaired the proliferation and invasion abilities of RA-FLSs in the presence of TNF-alpha or IL-1 beta. Western blot analysis revealed the reduction of Akt protein expression and phoshporylation in RA-FLSs by anacardic acid. However, the mRNA level of Akt remained unchanged. Anacardic acid treatment significantly increased the expression of miR-633 in RA-FLSs. Akt was identified as a novel target of miR-633. Overexpression of miR-633 significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of RA-FLSs, which was rescued by enforced expression of Akt. Depletion of miR-633 prevented anacardic acid-mediated suppression of proliferation and invasion of RA-FLSs, which was accompanied by increased expression of Akt protein. In conclusion, anacardic acid may serve as a promising agent in the treatment of RA.

AB Although serum chemokine levels have been reported to influence the outcome of interferon-based treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C, their effect on the hepatitis C virus (HCV) response to direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), which can achieve high rates of a sustained virological response (SVR), is largely unknown. To clarify this relationship, 9 chemokines (eotaxin, GRO-alpha, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1 alpha, mip-1 beta, RANTES, and SDF-1 alpha) were quantified before, during, and after DAA treatment using serum samples obtained from 57 patients with chronic hepatitis C. All baseline median chemokine levels were significantly higher in patients with chronic hepatitis C than in healthy subjects (P < 0.05). In particular, lower MIP-1 beta (<= 71.5 pg/mL) and higher RANTES ( > 671.5 pg/mL) levels were significantly associated with patients who failed to clear HCV RNA (P = 0.0039 and 0.013, respectively). Prediction of a clinical response based on a combination of these chemokines demonstrated high sensitivity (82%), specificity (85%), negative predictive value (95%), and area under the curve (0.833). The non-SVR rate (56.3%; 9 of 16) was significantly higher in patients with low MIP-1 beta and high RANTES compared with other combinations. Moreover, baseline mip-1 beta and RANTES were both additive and independent for predicting a non-SVR. Apart from an increase in eotaxin, all chemokines became decreased in patients with a SVR. In conclusion, a combination of serum MIP-1 beta and RANTES levels may be predictive of a treatment response to DAAs in Japanese patients with chronic hepatitis C.

AB Introduction: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex and multifactorial disease involving systemic inflammation. Although certain genetic components have been implicated in the development and progression of this disease, few studies have examined the participation of polymorphisms in proinflammatory genes and the extent to which polymorphisms are related to plasma levels of cytokines involved in the inflammatory process.
   Methods: Of the 1125 smokers participating in the study, 438 had COPD, and 687 did not. We determined the genotype of 5 SNPs distributed in the genes: IL6, CXL8, CSF2, CCL1 and IL1B. The plasma protein expression of these genes was also evaluated and categorized according to genotype and the severity of COPD (GOLD grade).
   Results: An analysis using the codominant model showed an association between rs1818879 in IL6 and susceptibility to COPD (GA OR = 1.1, AA OR = 1.77; p < 0.01), as well as an association between rs25882 in CSF2 and a greater severity of the disease (TC OR = 1.84, CC OR = 3.62; p < 0.01). No association was found between the presence of certain alleles in the SNPs and the plasma levels of the corresponding proteins.
   Conclusions: There are genetic polymorphisms related to susceptibility to COPD (rs1818879/A in IL6), as well as to the risk of greater severity of the disease (rs25882/T in CSF2). The presence of the alleles of interest did not significantly affect plasma levels of the codified proteins.

AB Interleukin 1 beta is a pro-inflammatory cytokine important for both normal immune responses and chronic inflammatory diseases. The regulation of the 31 kDa proIL-1 beta precursor coded by the IL1B gene has been extensively studied in myeloid cells, but not in lymphoid-derived CD4 T cells. Surprisingly, we found that some CD4 T cell subsets express higher levels of proIL-1 beta than unstimulated monocytes, despite relatively low IL1B mRNA levels. We observed a significant increase in IL1B transcription and translation in CD4 T cells upon ex vivo CD3/CD28 activation, and a similar elevation in the CCR5+ effector memory population compared to CCR5 - T cells in vivo. The rapid and vigorous increase in IL1B gene transcription for stimulated monocytes has previously been associated with the presence of Spi-1/PU.1 (Spi1), a myeloid-lineage transcription factor, pre-bound to the promoter. In the case of CD4 T cells, this increase occurred despite the lack of detectable Spi1 at the IL1B promoter. Additionally, we found altered epigenetic regulation of the IL1B locus in CD3/CD28-activated CD4 T cells. Unlike monocytes, activated CD4 T cells possess bivalent H3K4me3 + /H3K27me3 + nucleosome marks at the IL1B promoter, reflecting low transcriptional activity. These results support a model in which the IL1B gene in CD4 T cells is transcribed from a low-activity bivalent promoter independent of Spi1. Accumulated cytoplasmic proIL-1 beta may ultimately be cleaved to mature 17 kDa bioactive IL-1 beta, regulating T cell polarization and pathogenic chronic inflammation.

AB Purpose: Biliary atresia (BA) is a rare disease of unknown pathogenesis in infants characterized by an inflammatory, progressive destruction of the biliary system and deterioration of liver function. The standard treatment for BA is a Kasai-hepatoportoenterostomy (KPE). However, liver transplantation (LTX) becomes necessary in about 50-80% of cases. Therefore, some authors advocate for primary LTX in BA, but this would require early markers to predict which children would benefit from KPE or to show rapid progression to liver cirrhosis (RLC) instead.
   Methods: Snap-frozen liver biopsies and sera samples of 57 infants with BA were collected during KPE. Clinical and follow-up data were assessed via the biliary atresia and related diseases registry (BARD-online.com). Protein-levels of 25 pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators of 49 infants were assessed via multiplex protein immunoassay and analyzed by t-test as well as multidimensional principal component analysis.
   Results: 22 different immunomodulatory mediators were detectable in livers of children with BA, while serum protein levels were very low to undetectable. Following KPE, 33 BA patients showed RLC that required early LTX, while 24 had favorable course of disease with long-term survival with native liver (SNL). There were no significant differences between RLC and SNL in terms of local (from liver samples) nor systemic (from sera) immunomodulatory mediators. Protein levels were much lower in sera than in livers without statistical correlation.
   Conclusion: Our data suggest that local or systemic immunomodulatory mediators are unsuitable for predicting the disease course of BA. Thus, no deduction for optimal treatment strategy can be drawn. Collectively, we conclude that in BA, the degree of inflammation and protein microenvironment in the liver at the time-point of KPE are dismissible factors for the future course of disease.

AB Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen at the extremes of age. The elderly are particularly vulnerable to S. pneumoniae, the most common causative agent of bacterial pneumonia in this population. Despite the availability of vaccines and antibiotics, mortality rates associated with pneumococcal pneumonia in this age group remain high. In light of globally increasing life-expectancy, a better understanding of the patho-mechanisms of elderly pneumococcal pneumonia, including alterations in innate immune responses, is needed to develop improved therapies.
   In this study we aimed at investigating how increased susceptibility to pneumococcal infection relates to inflammation kinetics in the aged mouse pneumonia model by determining pulmonary cytokine and chemokine levels and comparing these parameters to those measured in young adult mice.
   Firstly, we detected overall higher pulmonary cytokine and chemokine levels in aged mice. However, upon induction of pneumococcal pneumonia in aged mice, delayed production of certain analytes, such as IFN-gamma, MIG (CXCL9), IP-10 (CXCL10), MCP-1 (CCL2), TARC (CCL17) and MDC (CCL22) became apparent. In addition, aged mice were unable to control excess inflammatory responses: while young mice showed peak inflammatory responses at 20 h and subsequent resolution by 48 h post intranasal challenge, in aged mice increasing cytokine and chemokine levels were measured. These findings highlight the importance of considering multiple time points when delineating inflammatory responses to S. pneumoniae in an age-related context. Finally, correlation between pulmonary bacterial burden and cytokine or chemokine levels in young mice suggested that appropriately controlled inflammatory responses support the host to fight pneumococcal infection.

AB Invasive fungal infections cause approximately 1.5 million deaths per year worldwide and are a growing threat to human health. Current anti-fungal therapies are often insufficient, therefore studies into host-pathogen interactions are critical for the development of novel therapies to improve mortality rates. Myeloid cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, express pattern recognition receptor (PRRs), which are important for fungal recognition. Engagement of these PRRs by fungal pathogens induces multiple cytokines, which in turn activate T effector responses. Interleukin (IL)-12 family members (IL-12p70, IL-23, IL-27 and IL-35) link innate immunity with the development of adaptive immunity and are also important for regulating T cell responses. IL-12 and IL-23 have established roles during anti-fungal immunity, whereas emerging roles for IL-27 and IL-35 have recently been reported. Here, we discuss the IL-12 family, focusing on IL-27 and IL-35 during anti-fungal immune responses to pathogens such as Candida and Aspergillus.

AB Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in rhesus macaques is often characterized by high viremia and CD4 T cell depletion. By contrast, SIV infection in African nonhuman primate natural hosts is typically nonpathogenic despite active viral replication. Baboons are abundant in Africa and have a geographical distribution that overlaps with natural hosts, but they do not harbor SIVs. Previous work has demonstrated baboons are resistant to chronic Sly infection and/or disease in vivo but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Using in vitro SIVmac infections, we sought to identify SIV restriction factors in baboons by comparing observations to the pathogenic rhesus macaque model. SIVmac replicated in baboon PBMC but had delayed kinetics compared to rhesus PBMC. However, SIVmac replication in baboon and rhesus isolated CD4 cells were similar to the kinetics seen for rhesus PBMC, demonstrating intracellular restriction factors do not play a strong role in baboon inhibition of SIVmac replication. Here, we show CD8 T cells contribute to the innate SIV-suppressive activity seen in naive baboon PBMC. As one mechanism of restriction, we identified higher production of MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, and RANTES by baboon PBMC. Contact between CD4 and CD8 T cells resulted in maximum production of these chemokines and suppression of viral replication, whereas neutralization of CCR5-binding chemokines in baboon PBMC increased viral loads. Our studies indicate baboon natural restriction of SIVmac replication is largely dependent on CD4-extrinsinc mechanisms mediated, in part, by CD8 T cells.

AB Background: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is most important cause of viral encephalitis worldwide. The pathogenesis of this is probably attributed to the host genetic makeup. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-) and monocytes chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) play a vital role in host defense mechanism against flavivirus causing encephalitis. We assessed the possible genetic association between ICAM-1 (K469E) and MCP-1-518 A > G polymorphisms and Japanese Encephalitis in North Indian population.
   Methods: We studied ICAM-1(K469E) and MCP-1-2518 A > G polymorphisms with the help of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. Expression of ICAM-1 and MCP-1 were determined at mRNA and protein levels in JE patients and healthy controls by real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
   Results: Homozygous (E/E) genotype of ICAM-1 was associated with clinical severity (p = 0.015) and outcome (p = 0.04) of JE, whereas, heterozygous (A/G) genotype of MCP-1-2518 A > G was associated with outcome in JE patients (p = 0.01). Among severe cases of JE, a higher level of ICAM-1 was observed in patients with E allele (E/K + E/E) of ICAM-1 (K469E) than non-E allele (K/K). The level of MCP-1 was found significantly increased in JE patients with homozygous (G/G) genotype when compared to wild (A/A) genotype of MCP-1-2518 A > G (p = 0.03).
   Conclusion: ICAM-1 (K469E) and MCP-1-2518 A > G polymorphisms lead to increased level of ICAM-1 and MCP-1 in Japanese Encephalitis which may be associated with severity as well as an adverse outcome of the disease. ICAM-1 (K469E) polymorphism may affect host susceptibility to Japanese encephalitis in North Indian population.

AB Background: Potential prognostic biomarkers for patients with sepsis have yet to be identified. The present study evaluated the prognostic value of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels in patients with sepsis.
   Methods: A total of 120 consecutive Chinese patients with sepsis were prospectively included, and serum levels of FGF21 and biomarkers such as interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-10, procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate (LAC) were measured within 24 h after intensive care unit admission. The demographic and clinical characteristics including underlying diseases, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (Delta SOFA), and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) scores were recorded. Patients were categorized into survival and non-survival groups according to the 28-day mortality. Correlations between FGF21, serum indicators, severity score and 28-day mortality were analyzed, and Cox regression analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the optimal cut-off of FGF21 for survival prediction.
   Results: Non-survivors had significantly higher levels of FGF21, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-10, PCT, CRP, and LAC as well as higher SOFA and APACHE II scores compared with the survivors. FGF21 levels were positively correlated with age, waist circumference, levels of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, PCT, CRP, and LAC, Delta SOFA and APACHE II scores. ROC curves showed that FGF21 had a high sensitivity of 81.3% and specificity of 89.8% for predicting 28-day mortality. Patients with a FGF21 levels < 3200 pg/ml had a significantly better survival rate than those with levels > 3200 pg/ml, and thus, FGF21 was an independent prognostic factor for survival.
   Conclusion: FGF21 could serve as a new prognostic biomarker for sepsis survival.

AB Thermogenic fat is a promising target for new therapies in diabetes and obesity. Understanding how thermogenic fat develops is important to develop rational strategies to treat obesity. Previously, we have shown that Tyk2 and STAT3, part of the JAK-STAT pathway, are necessary for proper development of classical brown fat. Using primary preadipocytes isolated from newborn mice we demonstrate that STAT3 is required for differentiation and robust expression of Uncoupling Protein 1 (UCP1). We also confirm that STAT3 is necessary during the early induction stage of differentiation and is dispensable during the later terminal differentiation stage. The inability of STAT3(-/-) preadipocytes to differentiate can be rescued using Wnt ligand secretion inhibitors when applied during the induction stage. Through chemical inhibition and RNAi, we show that it is the canonical beta-catenin pathway that is responsible for the block in differentiation; inhibition or knockdown of beta-catenin can fully rescue adipogenesis and UCP1 expression in the STAT3(-/-) adipocytes. During the induction stage, Wnts 1, 3a, and 10b have increased expression in the STAT3(-/-) adipocytes, potentially explaining the increased levels and activity of beta-catenin. Our results for the first time point towards an interaction between the JAK/STAT pathway and the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway during the early stages of in-vitro adipogenesis.

AB Background: The B cell activating factor (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) are tumor necrosis factor family members that regulate B cell maturation, proliferation, survival and function. We have previously shown that blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum hemozoin (HZ) can act as a T-independent antigen (TI Ag) that induces the production of specific IgG to soluble crude P. falciparum Ag through the BAFF pathway. However, we have not yet clarified whether HZ need APRIL signaling in the TI response. Here, we aimed to clarify whether both BAFF and APRIL signaling pathways play roles in HZ induction of specific antibody production without T-cell help.
   Methods: Normal monocytes alone or co-cultured with naive B cells were stimulated by HZ (10 mu M) in vitro. Naive B cell cultures, with HZ alone or with exogenous recombinant BAFF (rBAFF) and recombinant APRIL (rAPRIL) plus recombinant IL-4 (rIL-4) for 6 and 10 days were used as controls to investigate activation of B cells. At various times, the levels of sBAFF, sAPRIL, and HZ-specific IgG in the culture supernatants were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The BAFF and APRIL expression levels on the HZ-stimulated monocytes and their specific receptors on activated B cells, including the BAFF receptor (BAFF-R), the transmembrane activator and calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI) and the B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), were determined by flow cytometry. mRNA expression levels for the receptors were validated using Real-Time quantitative PCR.
   Results: HZ-activated monocytes released sBAFF and sAPRIL during the 72 h stimulation period. Increased mRNA encoding of their cognate receptors, BAFF-R, TACI, and BCMA, and increased HZ-specific IgG levels were also observed in HZ induction within the monocyte and B cell co-culture. The experiments under control conditions revealed that HZ alone could induce B cell culture to produce a small amount of the specific IgG compared with those in medium alone or rBAFF + rAPRIL + rIL-4.
   Conclusion: Taken together, we suggest that in the TI response HZ stimulates monocyte and B cell co-culture to produce specific IgG through BAFF, APRIL and other independent complimentary signaling pathways.

SO CYTOKINE

ID TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; ANTI-TNF; EXPANSION; RECEPTORS; THERAPY
AB TNF is a multifunctional cytokine that is critical to host defense against pathogens but can also drive the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases. Inhibition of TNF occasionally causes exacerbation of some auto immune diseases, suggesting a role for TNF in the regulation of immune homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that human peripheral blood CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) express membrane-bound TNF, a potent activator of the type 2 TNF receptor. While the type 1 TNF receptor can cause cell death and is expressed ubiquitously, the type 2 receptor promotes cell growth and its expression is limited mainly to immune and endothelial cells. When autocrine TNF is blocked in an in vitro culture without IL-2, activated Tregs stop proliferating. These data indicate a novel role for TNF as a Treg-derived autocrine growth factor.

TI Short-term exercise training reduces anti-inflammatory action of

AB A key pathological component of obesity is chronic low-grade inflammation, which is propagated by infiltration of immune cells into tissues and overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Cytokines that possess anti-inflammatory properties, such as interleukin (IL)-10 and IL6, may also play an important role. This study was designed to determine the impact of short-term exercise on the anti-inflammatory action of IL10 and IL6. Thirty-three inactive obese adults were randomized to two weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or moderate intensity continuous training (MICT). Fasting blood samples were collected before and after training. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production was measured in whole blood cultures in the presence or absence of IL10 or IL6. IL10 and IL6 receptor expression were measured on circulating monocytes, neutrophils, and T cells. HIIT and MICT reduced the ability of IL10 to inhibit LPS-induced TNF alpha production, with a greater effect with HIIT (Group x Time and IL10 x Time interactions, p's < 0.05). This reduction in 1110 function was not explained by altered IL10R1 expression, which was unchanged after training (p > 0.05). HIIT and MICT differentially affected IL6 function (Group x Time and IL6 x Time interactions, p's < 0.05) with evidence of reductions in the anti-inflammatory ability of IL6 with HIIT. Neither HIIT nor MICT altered levels of circulating IL10, IL6, or TNF alpha. The impact of short-term HIIT and MICT resulted in differential effects on anti-inflammatory cytokine function. The clinical implications remain to be determined but these novel findings indicate that measuring anti-inflammatory cytokine action could reveal important immunomodulatory effects of exercise.

AB Aim: Chronic inflammation has been associated to the development of cardiometabolic dysfunctions. The use of an intravenous (IV) catheter is highly recommended for physiology testing. Yet, the presence of an IV catheter triggers local inflammation that does not reflect systemic inflammatory status. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of an IV catheter on serum concentrations of IL-6, IL-8 and hsCRP in a fasting state and after a high-fat meal known to trigger low-grade inflammation.
   Methods: Twenty-two healthy subjects (7 men, 15 women) were included in this study. The trial included 2 visits. After an overnight fast, a venous catheter was inserted into an antecubital vein. A first blood sample was collected through this catheter at T = 0 min. On each visit, participants were requested either to drink only water for the whole duration of the test (WO test), or to consume a high-fat meal (HFM). Blood samples were collected through the catheter at T60, T120, T180 and T300 min. Additional venous punctures were performed on the contralateral arm at T180 and T300 min. Serum inflammatory mediators were measured at each time point of both interventions.
   Results: When serum was collected by venous punctures, IL-6 concentrations remained unchanged during both WO and HFM tests (P-time = 0.15 and P-time = 0.23, respectively), whereas the concentrations increased progressively over time when serum was collected through the catheter (P-time < 0.001). The high-fat meal had no additional effect on IL-6 levels (P-meal = 0.27) neither in serum collected by venous puncture nor in serum collected through the catheter. Serum IL-8 and hsCRP concentrations did not vary over time, and were influenced neither by the meal type nor by the blood collection method.
   Conclusion: The insertion of an indwelling catheter is associated with a local inflammatory response possibly mediated by IL-6 but not IL-8. This inflammatory response was not enhanced by a pro-inflammatory high-fat meal.

AB Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis and often causes injury to vascular endothelial cells. We found that pinocembrin, a natural antioxidant found in honey and certain herbs, protects human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) from ox-LDL-induced injury. Pinocembrin suppresses the expression of pro-inflammatory vascular adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and E-selectin) and cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-8), as well as ROS production induced by ox-LDL. Pinocembrin potently inhibits the attachment of monocytes to HAEC cells. Mechanistically, pinocembrin suppresses activation of the MAPK kinase p38 and NF-kappa B pathways in the context of ox-LDL. Our data indicate that pinocembrin is a promising versatile natural compound that can protect endothelial cells from injury.

AB Background: Quantification of biofluid cytokines is a rapidly growing area of translational research. However, comparability across the expanding number of available assay platforms for detection of the same proteins remains to be determined. We aimed to directly compare a panel of commonly measured cytokines in plasma of typically aging adults across two high sensitivity quantification platforms, Meso Scale Discovery high performance electrochemiluminiscence (HPE) and single-molecule immunosorbent assays (Simoa) by Quanterix.
   Methods: 57 community-dwelling older adults completed a blood draw, neuropsychological assessment, and brain MRI as part of a healthy brain aging study. Plasma samples from the same draw dates were analyzed for IL-10, IP-10, IL-6, TNF alpha, and IL-1 beta on HPE and Simoa, separately. Reliable detectability (coefficient of variance (CV) < 20% and outliers 3 interquartiles above the median removed), intra-assay precision, absolute concentrations, reproducibility across platforms, and concurrent associations with external variables of interest (e.g., demographics, peripheral markers of vascular health, and brain health) were examined.
   Results: The proportion of cytokines reliably measured on HPE (87.7-93.0%) and Simoa (75.4-93.0%) did not differ (ps > 0.32), with the exception of IL-1 beta which was only reliably measured using Simoa (68.4%). On average, CVs were acceptable at < 8% across both platforms. Absolute measured concentrations were higher using Simoa for IL-10, IL-6, and TNF alpha (ps < 0.05). HPE and Simoa shared only small-to-moderate proportions of variance with one another on the same cytokine proteins (range: r = 0.26 for IL-10 to r = 0.64 for IL-6), though platform agreement did not dependent on cytokine concentrations. Cytokine ratios within each platform demonstrated similar relative patterns of up- and down-regulation across HPE and Simoa, though still significantly differed (ps < 0.001). Supporting concurrent validity, all 95% confidence intervals of the correlations between cytokines and external variables overlapped between the two platforms. Moreover, most associations were in expected directions and consistently so across platforms (e.g., IL-6 and TNF alpha), though with several notable exceptions for IP-10 and IL-10.
   Conclusions: HPE and Simoa showed comparable detectability and intra-assay precision measuring a panel of commonly examined cytokine proteins, with the exception of IL-1 beta which was not reliably detected on HPE. However, Simoa demonstrated overall higher concentrations and the two platforms did not show agreement when directly compared against one another. Relative cytokine ratios and associations demonstrated similar patterns across platforms. Absolute cytokine concentrations may not be directly comparable across platforms, may be analyte dependent, and interpretation may be best limited to discussion of relative associations.

A case-control study was performed with a random sample of 72 children with ECC and 80 caries-free children. The explanatory variables were serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha, and NGAL) and the outcome was severity of ECC (number of decayed teeth). The crude analyses were used to estimate the association between each cytokine and ECC. Then, the analyses were adjusted for socioeconomic factors, excess weight and sugar sweetened beverages consumption using Poisson regression models. The estimated coefficients were expressed as Means Ratio (MR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). In the crude analyses, the highest tertiles of IL-6 (MR = 1.47, IC = 1.09-2.00, p = 0.012), TNF-alpha (MR = 1.33, CI = 1.00-1.78, p = 0.040) and NGAL (MR = 2.20, CI = 1.39-3.49, p = 0.001) were associated to ECC. After adjustment, the highest tertiles of IL-6 levels (MR = 1.54, IC = 1.13-2.10, p = 0.005), and NGAL (MR = 1.71, CI = 1.04-2.80, p = 0.032) remained associated to ECC; while TNF-alpha was no longer associated to ECC (MR = 1.31, CI = 0.98-1.75, p = 0.066). Higher serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines were associated to severity of caries in preschoolers, suggesting that chronic inflammation underlies ECC.

AB Objectives: Angiopoietin-like peptide 4 (ANGPTL-4) plays an important role in lipid metabolism by inhibiting the enzyme lipoprotein lipase. This effect of ANGPTL-4 results in suppression of the release of plasma triglyceri-dederived fatty acids. Increase in fatty acid levels entering to the liver and abnormalities in their secretion is one of the main mechanisms in pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of ANGPTL-4 in pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis by determining its levels in patients with fatty liver disease.
   Methods: Totally 51 patients (age: 37.9 +/- 9.9 years, M/F) diagnosed with grade 2-3 hepatic steatosis with ultrasound and 30 healthy volunteers (age: 34.8 +/- 9.5 years, M/F) were included in the study. In both groups, routine biochemical tests including fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin levels, triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL- cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, AST, ALT, ALP, GGT levels were measured together with the ANGPTL-4 levels. In determination of ANGPTL-4 levels, ELISA was performed.
   Results: When compared with the control group, ANGPTL-4 levels were determined to be decreased in patients with hepatic steatosis (369 +/- 243 vs 303 +/- 286 ng/mL, p = 0.014). There was a negative weak correlation observed between ANGPTL-4 and triglyceride levels (r = -0.246, p = 0.027). Among all groups, when patients with and without insulin resistance were compared; ANGPTL-4 levels were determined to be similar. While fasting blood glucose levels were similar between 2 groups; fasting insulin and triglyceride levels were determined to be increased in hepatic steatosis group (Insulin 17.7 +/- 12 vs 7.4 +/- 3.3 mu IU/mL, p < 0.001, triglyceride 158 +/- 46.4 vs 118 +/- 59.8 mg/dL p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: We have determined lower serum ANGPTL-4 levels in patients with hepatic steatosis. ANGPTL-4 that is regulating LPL activity plays an important role in fatty liver disease pathogenesis via free fatty acid metabolism and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPAR-delta). We believe that the results of this study would elucidate the investigations about the mechanism of fatty liver disease development and treatments targeting ANGPTL-4.

AB Background & aims: The chemokines CXCL10 (interferon Y-inducible protein 10 [IP-10]), CXCL11 (Human interferon inducible T cell alpha chemokine [I-TAC]), CXCL12 (stromal cell derived factor 1 [SDF-1]), and CXCL14 (breast and kidney-expressed chemokine [BRAK]) are involved in cell recruitment, migration, activation, and homing in liver diseases and have been shown to be upregulated during acute liver injury in animal models. However, their expression in patients with acute liver injury is unknown. Here, we aimed to provide evidence of the presence of circulating CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL12, and CXCL14 during human acute liver injury to propose new inflammation biomarkers for acute liver injury.
   Methods: We analyzed the serum concentration of the studied chemokines in healthy donors (n = 36) and patients (n = 163) with acute liver injuries of various etiologies.
   Results: Serum CXCL10, CXCL11 and CXCL12 levels were elevated in all the studied groups except biliary diseases for CXCL11. CXCL14 was associated with only acute viral infection and vascular etiologies. The strongest correlation was found between the IFN-inducible studied chemokines (CXCL10 and CXCL11) in all patients and more specifically in the acute viral infection group.
   Conclusion: These data provide evidence for the presence of circulating CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL12, and CXCL14 during acute liver injury and are consistent with data obtained in animal models. CXCL10, CXCL11 and CXCL12 were the most highly represented and CXCL14 the least represented chemokines. Differential expression patterns were obtained depending on acute liver injury etiology, suggesting the potential use of these chemokines as acute liver injury biomarkers.

AB Purpose: The aim of this study was to conduct a randomized clinical trial to assess the effects of 16 weeks of combined training on body composition, lipid profile, adiponectin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and leptin levels in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA).
   Methods: Fifty-eight HIV-infected individuals were randomized into a training group (T) or a control group (C). Combined training consisted of aerobic and resistance exercises performed at the same training session, applied at a frequency of three times a week for a total of 16 weeks. Waist circumference, body mass, body fat percentage (%fat), fat mass, lipid profile, adiponectin, CRP, and leptin levels were measured pre- and post-training in both groups.
   Results: Sixteen weeks of combined training decreased (P < 0.05) body fat in different body segments in PLWHA. Lipodystrophic PLWHA experienced greater reduction in body fat in the android region than non-lipodystrophic PLWHA after combined training. Lipid profile and circulating levels of adiponectin, leptin, and CRP remained unchanged.
   Conclusions: Sixteen weeks of combined training was effective to reduce body fat in different body segments, without altering plasma lipid and cytokine levels.

AB Background: IL-10 family cytokines are associated with the host immune response to pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), but their association with host response in tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBL) is not known.
   Methods: Hence, we examined the circulating levels of the whole panel of IL-10 family cytokines in TBL (n = 44) and compared them to the levels in PTB (n = 44) and healthy control (HC, n = 44) individuals. We also assessed the pre and post-treatment cytokine levels in TBL individuals following the completion of anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT). Next, we also compared the levels of IL-10 family cytokine in circulation versus lymph node (LN) culture supernatants in a subset of TBL individuals (n = 22). Finally, we also measured the levels of IL-10 family cytokines in tuberculosis antigen (purified protein derivative, PPD) stimulated and unstimulated LN culture supernatants.
   Results: TBL individuals exhibit significantly decreased levels of IL-10, IL-19, IL-20, IL-24, IL-28B and IL-29 in the circulation when compared to PTB (except IL-10) and HC (except IL-20 and IL-28B) and significantly increased levels of IL-22 when compared to PTB individuals. Following ATT, TBL individuals exhibit significantly elevated levels of IL-10, IL-19, IL-20, IL-24, IL-28B and IL-29 and significantly diminished levels of IL-26. Similarly, TBL individuals also exhibited significantly increased levels of IL-10, IL-19, IL-20, IL-24, IL-28A and IL-29 in LN culture supernatants compared to plasma and significantly decreased levels of IL-22. This was associated with enhanced levels of IL-19, IL-20, IL-24, IL-28B and IL-29 upon PPD stimulation of LN cultures.
   Conclusions: Therefore, we demonstrate that TBL is associated with significantly diminished plasma and elevated LN culture supernatant levels of most of the IL-10 family cytokines. This to our knowledge is the first comprehensive examination of IL-10 family cytokines in TBL.

AB Objective: This study was aimed to explore whether the omentin-1, a novel adipokine marker, could be a biomarker for stroke, as well as its association with stroke severity.
   Methods: This study included 239 patients with ischemic stroke. The serum omentin-1 level was determined and the stroke was evaluated when the patients were hospitalized. The control groups consisted of 108 patients with matched age, gender and prior vascular risk factors and 120 health control with matched age and gender. The stroke severity was assessed with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) when the patients were hospitalized, and NIHSS score > 6 was evaluated as moderate-to-severe stroke.
   Results: Omentin-1 level in serum samples of 239 stroke patients was determined, with the median value of 109.5 ng/ml [Inter Quartile Range (IQR), 78.4-142.9 ng/ml]. There was a negative relation between omentin-1 level and the infarct volume (r = -0.289, P = 0.001). The level of omentin-1 was significantly reduced in stroke patients than that of in control group 1 [125.3 (IQR, 95.8-158.7); P = 0.002] and control group 2 [146.5 (IQR, 116.2-177.3); P < 0.001]. With the analysis of multivariate model, omentin-1 as a continuous variable was related to lowered stroke risk (odds ratios [OR] 0.994, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.990-0.998; P = 0.006). In addition, omentin-1 was an independent indicator for stroke severity (OR 0.992, 95% CI: 0.989-0.996). Levels of omentin-1 in the Q1 showed a relative risk of 2.66 (95% CI: 1.52-4.18) for moderate-to-severe stroke after adjusting for above possible confounders compared to reference category [Quartile (Q): 2-4].
   Conclusion: The data indicated a negative relation between omentin-1 level and risk of ischemic stroke. The omentin-1 could be promising indicator of stroke and its severity.

AB In human hematologic malignancies, some of the TNF receptor family members are up-regulated and have the ability to evoke reactions favoring tumor progression. Moreover, cell migration molecules, Fascin-1 and Versican are involved in proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cells. They are linked to many human cancers. Therefore, we conducted this study to evaluate both the plasma and leukocytes concentrations of tumor necrosis factor receptor super family 2 (TNFRSF2), TNFRSF9, Fascin-1 and Versican in patients with acute leukemia, as well as to correlate these values with clinical features and treatment outcome. Therefore, forty-eight patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), thirty-two patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and fifteen control subjects were included. TNFRSF2, TNFRSF9, Fascin-1 and Versican were measured in plasma and leukocytes of all subjects by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We found that plasma TNFRSF9 was highly elevated in ALL and AML as compared with the control group. In addition, AML patients who failed to achieve complete remission showed a significant increase in leukocytes TNFRSF9 level. TNFRSF2 is significantly increased in plasma and leukocytes of ALL patients when compared with the control group and AML patients. Fascin-1 significantly increased in AML, but not in ALL cases. Plasma and leukocytes levels of Versican significantly increased in AML compared to both control and ALL subjects. Plasma Versican correlated with poor response to induction of chemotherapy in AML cases. In conclusion, TNFRSF2 and TNFRSF9 could act as a possible prognostic biomarkers for the outcomes of ALL patients and TNFRSF9 could be a potential target in AML. Versican may be used as a diagnostic biomarker and as a predictor of the response to chemotherapy in AML. In addition, plasma Fascin-1 is a potential biomarker for AML.

AB BLT1, the primary functional receptor of Leukotriene B4 (LTB4), is involved in tissue inflammation by mediating leukocyte recruitment, and recently LTB4-dependent inflammation was reported to promote lung tumor growth. Exposure to diesel exhaust particle (DEP), the major component of particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), can elicit lung inflammation, which may increase the risk of lung cancer. However, it remains unknown about the critical factors mediating DEP-induced lung inflammation and the subsequent effect on tumor metastasis. In this study, we found that DEP exposure led to acute lung inflammation, characterized by abundant infiltration of neutrophils and elevated lung levels in LTB4, as well as several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-113, IL-6, TNF-a, CXCL1/2. Furthermore, DEP exposure promoted lung metastasis of 3LL and 4T1 cells. BLT1 blockade by its specific antagonist U75302 significantly inhibited neutrophilic lung inflammation following DEP exposure. Importantly, BLT1 blockade before the onset of inflammation significantly reduced DEPenhanced lung metastasis, which was associated with greatly decreased infiltrating neutrophils in lungs. Interestingly, BLT1 blockade after the occurrence of lung metastases had no effect on the magnitude of lung metastasis, suggesting that inhibition of BLT1-mediated lung inflammation was insufficient to suppress established metastatic tumor. Administration of BLT2 inhibitor LY255283 fails to inhibit DEP-induced lung inflammation and tumor metastasis. Collectively, our results demonstrate that DEP exposure causes BLT1-mediated lung neutrophilic inflammation, which is critical for tumor lung metastasis, and suggest that interruption of the LTB4-BLT1 axis could be useful for preventing PM2.5-induced inflammation and subsequent susceptible to lung metastasis.

AB Endothelial barrier dysfunction leads to increased endothelial permeability and is an early step in the development of vascular inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), a proinflammatory cytokine, is known to cause increased endothelial permeability. However, the mechanisms by which IFN-gamma disrupts the endothelial barrier have not been clarified. This study aimed to investigate how IFN-gamma impairs the endothelial barrier integrity by specifically examining the roles of caldesmon, adherens junctions (AJs) and p38 mitogenactivated protein (MAP) kinase in IFN-gamma-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction. IFN-gamma exhibited a biphasic effect on caldesmon localization and both the structural organization and protein expression of AJs. In the early phase (4-8 h), IFN-gamma induced the formation of peripheral caldesmon bands and discontinuous AJs, while AJ protein expression was unchanged. Interestingly, IFN-gamma also stimulated caldesmon phosphorylation, resulting in actin dissociation from caldesmon at 8 h. Conversely, changes seen in the late phase (16-24 h) included cytoplasmic caldesmon dispersal, AJ linearization and junctional area reduction, which were associated with reduced membrane, cytoskeletal and total AJ protein expression. In addition, IFN-gamma enhanced myosin binding to caldesmon at 12 h and persisted up to 24 h. Furthermore, inhibition of p38 MAP kinase by SB203580 did not reverse either the early or late phase changes observed. These data suggest that IFN-gamma may activate signaling molecules other than p38 MAP kinase. In conclusion, our findings enhance the current understanding of how IFN-gamma disrupts endothelial barrier function and reveal potential therapeutic targets, such as caldesmon and AJs, for the treatment of IFN-gamma-associated vascular inflammatory diseases.

TI Vitamin D pathway activation selectively deactivates signal transducer

AB Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, has been well documented to act directly on immune cells and malignant cells. Activated T cells are one of the best characterized targets of calcitriol, with effects including decreasing inflammatory cytokine output and promoting anti-inflammatory cytokine production. However, the effects of calcitriol on natural killer (NK) cells are less clear. Reports suggest that only immature NK cell populations are affected by calcitriol treatment resulting in impaired cytotoxic function and cytokine production, while mature NK cells may have little or no response. NK cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (NK-LGLL) is a rare leukemia with CD3-CD16 + CD56 +NK cell clonal expansion. The current standard treatments are immunosuppressant therapies, which are not curative. The Janus kinase (JAK) signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway is hyperactivated in LGLL and is one pathway of interest in new drug target investigations. We previously demonstrated the ability of calcitriol to decrease STAT1 tyrosine 701 (p-STAT1) and STAT3 tyrosine 705 (p-STAT3) phosphorylation as well as inflammatory cytokine output of T cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia cells, but did not determine the effects of calcitriol on NK-LGLL. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether NKL cells, a model of NK-LGLL, and NK-LGLL patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are susceptible to treatment with calcitriol or seocalcitol (EB1089), a potent analog of calcitriol. NKL cells are dependent on interleukin (IL)-2 for survival and we show here for the first time that treatment with IL-2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs 1 through 6. Both calcitriol and EB1089 caused significant upregulation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR). IL-2 induction of p-STAT1 and p-STAT3 phosphorylation was significantly decreased after calcitriol or EB1089 treatment. Additionally, IL-10, interferon (IFN)y, and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt-3L) extracellular output was significantly decreased at 100 nM EB1089 and intracellular IL-10 was decreased with either calcitriol or EB1089 treatment We treated NK-LGLL patient PBMCs with calcitriol or EB1089 and found decreased p-STAT1 and p-STAT3 while VDR increased, which matched the NKL cell line data. We then measured 75 serum cytokines in NK-LGLL patients (n = 8) vs. age- and sex-matched normal healthy donors (n = 8), which is the first serum cytokine study for this LGLL subtype. We identified 15 cytokines, including IL-10 and Flt-3L, which were significantly different between normal donors and NK-LGLL patients. Overall, our results suggest that activating the vitamin D pathway could be a mechanism to decrease STAT1 and 3 activation and inflammatory cytokine output in NK-LGLL patients.

AB Endothelial cells (EC) are critical sites of human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) infection in vivo. Infection can induce the production of various EC cytokines, such as interleukin (IL-)6, which can have autocrine and/or paracrine effector functions. Here, we report that hCMV induces the production of EC IL-11, a relatively understudied member of the IL-6-type cytokine family. We detail temporal EC IL-11 translation and protein secretion dynamics in response to hCMV infection, and reveal distinct differences compared to EC IL-6. Viral replication had markedly opposing effects on the regulation of these closely related cytokines, representing a major driving force behind IL-11 production, whilst concurrently suppressing IL-6 expression. This is the first report of any biological agent that stimulates EC IL-11 production.

AB CD9, a member of the tetraspanin superfamily, has been implicated in regulating various physiological processes, including cell motility, adhesion, apoptosis and metastasis. Recently, interleukin-16 (IL-16), a pro-inflammatory cytokine released by normal airway and alveolar epithelial cells, has been implicated as a possible ligand for CD9 as an alternative receptor. In this study, using A549 cells as a model of human alveolar epithelium, CD9 expression was ablated using CRISPR/Cas technology. Decreased expression of CD9 mRNA and protein levels was confirmed through RT-qPCR and flow cytometry, respectively. Individual clones were generated that expressed high levels of CD9 (wild-type, WT) or significantly less CD9 (knockdown, ICD). Both wild type and knockdown A549 cell migration was quantified using a FluoroBloc transwell chemotaxis assay. Our results indicate that wild-type A549 cells migrated towards chemoattractants. Moreover, CD9 expression was required in this process since the CD9 knockdown cells had a significantly reduced migration towards growth serum and IL-16. These results support the migratory properties for CD9 in human lung cells and support the hypothesis that CD9 serves as an alternative receptor for IL-16.

AB The produce of high-efficiency materials in hydrogen evolution technology is a priority. Recent development in graphene-based material shows that it can be a good candidate for this target. Accordingly, the MoCoFeS/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) catalyst was prepared by the hydrothermal method for hydrogen evolution reaction. The catalysts were characterized and the effect of rGO on the electrochemical properties of the catalyst was examined. Our results are encouraging that, the optimized catalyst (MoCoFeS/rG00.4) at -110 mV overpotential with a Tafel slope of 50.26 mV dec(-1) can be a novel candidate for an active non-precious metal hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst.

AB First-principles calculation based on DFT is performed to explore the structural, electronic and optical properties of monatomic Au or Cl adsorption on the bridge and fourfold hollow site of the 1I-terminated BiOI (0 0 1) surface. The results indicate that Au/BiOI and Cl/BiOI adsorption systems not only possess the better structural stability but also exhibit the perfect utilization of the visible light. The range of visible light utilization is broadened after Au or Cl adsorption at the B and H sites thus the photocatalytic performance can be improved. Au adsorption at H site shows the best photocatalytic performance and structural stability. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The structure of Pt-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst which shows high performance for dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane, a prospective hydrogen carrier, was investigated by XAFS and DFT calculations. Mn addition on Pt/Al2O3 brings higher activity, selectivity, and stability for dehydrogenation of MCH than with Pt/Al2O3 alone. Results of XAFS and DFT calculations revealed that MnOx selectively covered the unsaturated coordination of Pt. On the unsaturated step facets such as Pt (1 1 0) and Pt (3 1 1), demethylation proceeds easily. Addition of Mn on Pt/Al2O3 catalyst brought selective dehydrogenation of MCH by coverage of such step sites with MnOx.

AB SrTiO3 and SrTiO3:Er3+ nanoparticles were synthesized by a sol-gel method. The synthesized SrTiO3:Er3+ nanoparticles exhibit green and red emissions under the excitation at 980 nm. Both SrTiO3 and SrTiO3:Er3+ nanoparticles exhibit photocatalytic hydrogen production under the irradiation of simulated sunlight. Moreover, SrTiO3:Er3+ nanoparticles show higher photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production than that of SrTiO3 nanoparticles. The results indicate that SrTiO3 is a good host for Er-3(+) and the incorporation of Er-3(+) is an effect way to enhance the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production.

AB Novel ZnO particles with hierarchical and biomorphic porous microstructures were first synthesized through a bionic method and the individual ZnO, pine cones-like ZnO/rGO composites were prepared via 'one-pot' solvothermal route. All of above samples are characterized by SEM, XRD, Raman spectrometer and XPS. The results of degradation of rhodamine B indicated that ZnO/leaf exhibited better photocatalytic properties than individual ZnO, the ZnO/rGO with ZnO/rGO ratios at 20:1 shows the best photocatalytic performance. Results indicate that both the morphology design of ZnO through a bionic method and graphene doping can enhance the photocatalytic performance of zinc oxide.

The leaves were carbonized and then activated with KOH, and the nitrogen element in the leaves was used as the nitrogen source. The carbon showed a high surface area of 1736 m(2)/g. A high CO2 uptake of 5.86 mmol/g at 1 bar and 273 K was achieved by the carbon activated at 600 degrees C. The test results also revealed that for carbons with similar volume of small micropores, the one with a high nitrogen content tended to achieve better adsorption performances.

AB In organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, the open-circuit voltage (V-oc) is one of the most important parameters that determines the device performance. Generally, the maximum value of V-oc is set by the energy gap (E-gap). However, the E-gap value of the active layer of an operating device will deviate from that based on the energy levels of the individual materials due to the occurrence of complicated interfacial physical and chemical interactions. Here, we systematically investigated the effects of the interfacial energy band alignment with different polymer donors and small-molecule acceptors. The E-gap values increased in the presence of an interfacial dipole, leading to a larger voltage loss (Delta) than expected.

AB We employ the Monte-Carlo Basin-Hopping (MC-BH) global optimisation technique with inter- atomic pair potentials to generate low-energy candidates of stoichiometric alumina octomers ((Al2O3)(8)). The candidate structures are subsequently refined with density functional theory calculations employing hybrid functionals (B3LYP and PBEO) and a large basis set (6-311 + G(d)) including a vibrational analysis. We report the discovery of a set of energetically low-lying alumina octomer clusters, including a new global minimum candidate, with shapes that are elongated rather than spherical. We find a stability limit for these and smaller-sized clusters at a temperature of T similar or equal to 1300-1450 K corresponding to a phase transition in liquid alumina.

AB Ni nanoparticles (NPs) confined within SiO2 networks with interparticle mesopores (Ni/SiO2-IS) were successfully synthesized via in-situ process with a combination of azeotropic distillation and solvothermal methods. Ni/SiO2 -IS catalyst showed 65% high selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol at total conversion (> 99%), which can be due to the confinement of Ni NPs in pores and were inaccessible to reactant molecules. It is expected that this simple and versatile method could be extended to cover many kinds of other selective catalytic reactions in the future.

AB In this study, the decomposition of acetic acid to lower fraction products (i.e., CH4, CH3CHO, CO, and CO2) is elucidated using different possible pathways along with their potential energy surfaces under density functional theory (DFT) framework. Furthermore, a kinetic investigation involving evaluations of rate constants, Arrhenius constants and equilibrium rate constants of all elementary reaction steps is carried out at a wide range of temperature (298-698 K) and a fixed pressure of 1 atm. Briefly, results indicate that overall decomposition of acetic acid is favourable through OH cleavage reaction route over both catalyst clusters involving elementary reaction steps of OH cleavage of acetic acid, CO cleavage of acetyl species, and hydrogenation of methyl to produce methane. The decomposition of acetic acid over both catalysts is highly likely to produce methane and CO2 rather producing acetaldehyde which agrees with the existing experimental results. The formation of water from hydrogenation of hydroxyl group is not favourable over both catalyst clusters especially Ru/MgO catalyst. According to the kinetic investigation, the performance of supported Ru catalyst, i.e., Ru/MgO is superior to that of bare Ru catalyst for the decomposition of acetic acid.

AB A strong polar cyano group was introduced to increase the interfacial polarization between filler and matrix, thereby improving the dielectric properties of polymer composites. 3-Cyanomethyl-1-vinyl imidazolium bromide (CMVImBr) ionic liquid was first synthesized, copolymerized with divinylbenzene on the surface of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to form a core-shell structured hybrid, and then compounded with epoxy to prepare a filler-well-dispersed composite with high dielectric constant. The dielectric constant of the composites reached 139 at 1 kHz when the filler content was 20%, and the dielectric loss was only 0.088. The cyano groups and ionic bonds from CMVImBr played a significant role in increasing the dielectric constant owing to interfacial polarization. Moreover, the crosslinked polymer shells decreased the dielectric loss and served as electrical barriers between CNTs, which are desirable properties for electronic devices.

AB The fabrication of nanocomposite structures for Nano-Optics is facing many challenges due to the special performance requirements. In this work, a novel Ag nanoprism@SiO2@QD composite nanostructure is designed and fabricated to meet the desire of optical experiments. This material has good morphology and high monodispersity, and quantum dots can stably attach to the silica layer through chemical bonds. Simulation results confirm that this nanostructure can generates a Rabi splitting with a maximum value of 112 meV. Our coupling system creates a new combination of Ag nanoprisms and quantum dots, providing a high performance nanostructure for future photonic systems.

AB Organolead-halide-perovskite-based solar cells have recently attracted significant attention due to excellent photovoltaic performance and low cost. To improve the conversion efficiency, lots of efforts have been devoted to optimize chemical components and the film fabrication. However, the kinetics of solutes in solution and its effect on the film quality are less understood. Our results reveal that aging of the precursor solution containing PbI2 and CH3NH3I facilitated crystallization and resulted in a more uniform film. Further analysis indicates that in solution PbI2 flakes were gradually dissociating into small oligomers, and then form complex with CH3NH3I.

AB Porous BiOCl nanocubes with highly crystalline was successfully synthesized via a facile mannitol-assisted hydrothermal route. The results reveal that mannitol has great influence on BiOCl crystal structure and morphology, as well as photocatalytic activity. BiOCl (k = 0.190 min(-1)) exhibits excellent photocatalytic activities by the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) almost completely after 20 min visible-light irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic-activity is owing to its highly crystalline, porous structure and positive valence band. This work provides a green strategy on synthesizing porous Bi-based nanocubes with highly active photocatalysis and offers new inside the importance of mannitol on the photocatalysis preparation process.

DE Resistive switching; C/ZnO/C; White light
ID MEMORY; BEHAVIORS; DEVICES
AB The C/ZnO/C heterostructure is fabricated on single silicon substrate using magnetron sputtering system. The device shows an obvious bipolar resistive switching (RS) memory behavior, which can be modulated by the white light at room temperature. The RS ratio and Set/Reset voltage can be controlled by the white light. A high RS ratio of 10(5) under illumination can be obtained, while the RS ratio in the dark is about 3. Not only the favorable RS ratio can be realized, but also the RS behaviors show excellent stability and endurance characteristics in C/ZnO/C memory cells. Based on the double-logarithm I-V fitting, the electrons trapping and de-trapping should result in the resistive switching behavior of C/ZnO/C memory cells.

AB Cadmium sulfide doped magnesium ions (CdxMg1-xS) one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures have been fabricated through high-temperature solid-vapor deposition process. SEM observation shows that the branched CdxMg1-xS nanowires are vertically aligned over each surface of the nanowire in the radial direction. The multiphoton Raman scattering of the as-prepared samples exhibited the presence of lattice defects in the system. Due to the incorporation of the Mg dopant into CdS, the 1TO, A(1)(TO), E-2(H), and 1LO Raman modes show red-shift and that of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) are broadened. The photoluminescence property shows one broad-band and intensive orange-yellow light emission. The broad-band emission situated at 500-800 nm can be divided into mull-peaks through the Gaussian fitting curves, centered at 535 nm, 607 nm, 652 nm, and 731 nm, respectively. The peaks situated at 535 nm, 607 nm, and 652 nm would be originated by Mg doping to form defects in CdS.

AB The liquid state property and intermetallic compound growth of Zr2Ni alloy were investigated by electrostatic levitation(ESL) technique. The relation between liquid undercooling and superheating followed a sigmoidal curve, which was probably attributed to the liquid structure transition. This assumption was supported by the density and viscosity measurement of liquid Zr2Ni alloy. Meanwhile, the diffusion-limited growth mechanism of Zr2Ni compound phase was demonstrated by the measured dendritic growth velocity. Within the undercooling range of 70-277 K(0.20 T-L), the dendritic growth velocity displayed a parabolic relation versus undercooling, which achieved a maximum value of 27 mm s(-1).

AB Objective: To describe women's experiences with subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) to inform scale-up of self-administered DMPA-SC.
   Study design: We conducted a 12-month randomized controlled trial in Malawi to measure DMPA-SC continuation rates. A total of 731 women presenting at six Ministry of Health clinics or to community health workers (CHWs) in rural communities were randomized to receive DMPA-SC administered by a provider or be trained to self-inject DMPA-SC. Data collectors contacted women after the reinjection window at 3, 6 and 9 months to collect data on satisfaction and use; self-injectors were also queried about storage and disposal of DMPA-SC. We compared frequencies of injection experiences and satisfaction by study group and over time.
   Results: Ninety-two percent of women who self-injected felt it was easy to do the first time. Women in the selfadministered group primarily gave themselves the injection versus having someone else inject them; stored DMPA-SC mostly in bags, often in ways to keep the product away from others; and properly disposed of DMPA-SC in pit latrines. Women in both groups used printed calendars to remember when to get/be given their next injection. Both groups reported high satisfaction with DMPA-SC.
   Conclusions: Women in low-resource settings can be successfully trained by public sector CHWs and clinic-based providers to self-inject and to appropriately store and dispose of DMPA-SC. DMPA-SC and self-injection are acceptable and feasible in a low-resource setting.
   Implications: Self-administered and provider-administrated DMPA-SC should be scaled up, and the lessons learned during our trial should be applied to future scale-up efforts. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to examine continuation of subcutaneous and intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC and DMPA-IM) when administered by facility-based health workers in Burkina Faso and Village Health Teams (VHTs) in Uganda.
   Study design: Participants were family planning clients of health centers (Burkina Faso) or VHTs (Uganda) who had decided to initiate injectable use. Women selected DMPA-SC or DMPA-IM and study staff followed them for up to four injections (providing 12 months of pregnancy protection) to determine contraceptive continuation. Study staff interviewed women at their first injection (baseline), second injection, fourth injection and if they discontinued either product.
   Results: Twelve-month continuation in Burkina Faso was 50% for DMPA-SC and 47.4% for DMPA-IM (p=A1, N=990, 492 DMPA-SC and 498 DMPA-IM). Twelve-month continuation in Uganda was 77.8% for DMPA-SC and 77.4% for DMPA-IM (p=.85, N=1224, 609 DMPA-SC and 615 DMPA-IM). Reasons for discontinuation of DMPA across groups in Burkina Faso included side effects (90/492, 18.3%), being late for injection (68/492, 13.8%) and refusal of spouse (51/492, 10.4%). Reasons for discontinuation in Uganda included being late for injection (65/229, 28.4%), received from non-VHT (50/229, 21.8%) and side effects (34/229, 14.8%). Increased age (adjusted hazard ratio=0.98, p=.01) and partner acceptance of family planning (adjusted hazard ratio=0.48, p<.001) had protective effects against discontinuation in Burkina Faso; we did not find statistically significant variables in Uganda.
   Conclusions: There is no difference in 12-month continuation (through four injections) between DMPA-SC and DMPA-IM whether from facility-based health workers in Burkina Faso or VHTs in Uganda. Continuation was higher through community-based distribution in Uganda than health facilities in Burkina Faso.
   Implications: The subcutaneous formulation of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) is increasingly available in Family Planning 2020 countries. Use of DMPA-SC does not appear to change continuation relative to traditional intramuscular DMPA. Growing evidence of DMPA-SC's suitability for community-based distribution and self-injection may yield indirect benefits for contraceptive continuation and help reach new users.

AB Objectives: To document the experience of three groups of Family Planning service providers participating in task shifting for the provision of subcutaneous depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) at the community level in the DRC.
   Study design: This article compares results from interviews with DMPA-SC providers in two separate pilot studies: 1) 53 medical and nursing school students teaching women how to self-inject (2016-2017); and 2) 34 lay community health workers providing DMPA-SC in rural areas of Lualaba (2017). All providers gave information on socio-demographic characteristics, recruitment,) training, supervision, experience and satisfaction with the provision of DMPA-SC. The paper examines variations in responses from the different provider cadres.
   Results: Despite substantive variations in provider profiles in terms of age, educational and marital status, reported levels of satisfaction with offering DMPA-SC in the community were consistently high. Over 90% of all providers declared being comfortable or very comfortable interacting with FP clients, and more than three quarters of them were very comfortable performing an injection. Over 90% of Lualaba providers and over 80% of student providers gave correct responses to DMPA-SC protocol questions regarding referral of clients to facilities and side-effects management. The vast majority declared being (very) satisfied with their experience providing DMPA-SC.
   Conclusions: Providers with and without a clinical background, when properly trained and supervised, can provide DMPA-SC at the community level in both urban and rural settings of the DRC. Support strategies from the Family Planning environment (continuous contraceptive supplies and adequate referral system to fixed facilities) are key to engaging community health workers and sustainably leveraging task-shifting opportunities.
   Implication statement: This study provides additional evidence on the acceptability and feasibility of task-shifting in relation to DMCP-SC and supports further scale-up efforts. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The thermoregulation of buildings and cities by green roofs is a primary driver of their integration into urban environments. In warm seasons, green roofs cool buildings (thereby reduce interior air conditioning costs), and cities (impervious surfaces contribute to urban heat islands and vegetation mitigates contributions by conventional roof surfaces). In cool seasons, green roofs insulate buildings by reducing heat flux through the roof surface. Here we investigate thermoregulation services provided by extensive green roofs in warm and cool seasons from temperature data points recorded at 5-minute intervals over a four-year period, and from modules containing either Sedum or perennial grasses and herbaceous flowers, mineral- or organic-based substrate, 10 cm or 15 cm substrate depth, and supplemental irrigation or none. We demonstrate that Sedum outperformed a mixture of perennial grasses and herbaceous flowers over the total inter-annual survey period. The meadow mixture was more dependent on supplemental irrigation than Sedum, but more susceptible to inter-annual climate variability. Our findings point to the durability of Sedum as a plant for extensive green roof cooling, as well as the importance of plant selection and identifying traits that match not just microclimatic conditions in summer, but also in winter.

AB The effect of adding rice husk as an electron donor on the genetic and metabolic diversity of denitrifying communities in a long-term flooded constructed wetland (D1) was compared with the control group without external carbon source addition (D2). The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for nitrate removal were quantified under different nitrate loading rates. The results showed that Dl achieved higher and more stable removal efficiencies for NO3--N (90-97%) and total nitrogen (73-87%) under different nitrate loading rates, which were approximately 10 times higher than those of D2. This corresponded with much higher absolute abundances of bacterial and nitrogen functional genes in D1 than D2. Additionally, the vertical distribution of microbial communities in D1 and D2 showed significant differences. This pattern suggested that adding rice husk in flooded CWs had beneficial effects on the denitrifying community. Quantitative response relationships and network analysis indicated that denitrification was the dominant nitrogen removal pathway. Moreover, the present study indicated that using rice husk as an external carbon source could be conducive to completing the nitrification process, which was first confirmed at the molecular level. The present study indicated that using rice husk as an external carbon source can significantly enhance denitrification rates and thus improve nitrogen removal in CWs for wastewater treatment process.

AB Miyun reservoir watershed is a major source of drinking water for China's capital, Beijing, which has a population of 21.75 million. Recently, the capacity of the Miyun reservoir to supply clean drinking water has been threatened by increasing eutrophication (or algae bloom), mainly due to the discharge of wastewater and excessive fertilization application in the upstream watershed. Therefore, there is an urgent need to design effective best management practices (BMPs) to reduce upstream nutrient load and improve water quality in the Miyun reservoir. In this study, we built a watershed model (the Soil and Water Assessment Tool) for the Miyun Reservoir Watershed (MRW) and calibrated and validated it using long-term sediment, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) data. Furthermore, we developed a Markov Chain based multi-objective optimization program to explore optimal BMPs with tradeoffs between economic costs and water quality responses. Using the watershed model and multi-objective optimization algorithms, we explored the potential effectiveness of BMPs under two scenarios that are currently being considered. Scenario 1 assumes that funding for BMP implementation comes from national grants and targets high water quality standards, whereas scenario 2 assumes funding is provided by farmers and targets water quality that meet the drinking water standards. We found substantial discrepancies between the two scenarios with respect to the types and spatial configurations of BMPs and associated economic costs, highlighting the need to reconcile concerns from different stakeholders in order to arrive at a BMP plan that all parties will agree upon. In addition, we found that cross-subwatershed coordination and targeting flood season instead of year-round water quality standards could pronouncedly reduce the economic costs of BMP implementations without substantially degrading water quality. The watershed scale optimization method developed here holds promise to serve as an effective tool to explore tradeoffs between economic costs, water quality improvements, and decision makers' and stakeholders' concerns in BMP design, thereby informing sustainable watershed scale water resources management and ecosystem maintenance.

AB Creation and conservation of urban parks is challenging in arid environments where daily thermal extremes, water scarcity, air pollution and shortage of natural green spaces are more conspicuous. Water scarcity in the arid regions of Iran is major challenge for water managers. Accurate estimation of urban landscape evapo-transpiration is therefore critically important for cities located in naturally dry environments, to appropriately manage irrigation practices. This study investigated two factor-based approaches, Water Use Classifications of Landscape Species (WUCOLS) and Landscape Irrigation Management Program (LIMP), to measure the water demand of two heterogeneous urban landscapes: a botanic garden and a sparse forest park. The irrigation water volume applied was compared with the gross water demand for the period from 2011 to 2013. In this research, WUCOLS estimated the annual water requirement of a botanic garden and a sparse forest park to be 5% and 44% lower, respectively, than LIMP. Comparison of estimated and applied irrigation showed that water savings can be made by the LIMP method. The outcomes of this research stressed the need to modify the irrigation requirements based on effective rainfall throughout the year, rather relying on long-term average data.

AB Understanding changes in soil chemical and microbial properties under different vegetation types on post-mining sites is an important step in developing management practices to enhance ecosystem functions. Changes in soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stock, pH, bulk density and microbial properties (microbial biomass, respiration and ergosterol content) were studied in chronosequences on reclaimed and unreclaimed grasslands on heaps after lignite mining in the northwest of the Czech Republic. Reclaimed sites were established by applying topsoil and seeding cultural grasses and legumes. Unreclaimed sites were only levelled and spontaneously colonized by grassy vegetation dominated by bushgrass (Calamagrostis epigejos (L.) Roth). Topsoil application created more favourable conditions for organic matter accumulation in soil. The C and N contents in the soil of reclaimed sites increased with age, while no significant changes occurred in unreclaimed sites. The results indicated a high potential for C sequestration in reclaimed grasslands with topsoiling, estimated at up to 1.6 t ha y(-1). The P content did not change with age in either reclaimed or unreclaimed sites. Microbial biomass and respiration increased with chronosequence in both sites. However, respiration did not differ between reclaimed and unreclaimed sites, while microbial biomass was significantly higher in reclaimed sites.

AB Tools that provide decision makers with an understanding of ecosystem response to changes in streamflow attributes are necessary to balance human and ecosystem water needs. Flow response curves provide one such approach for informing management based on modeled relationships between environmental control (e.g., flood magnitude) and response (e.g., plant recruitment) variables, although unidirectional relationships may fail to capture the complex interactions between ecological and physical processes in riparian ecosystems. We take advantage of the linkage between plant functional traits important for (a) determining a plant's response to environmental conditions and (b) for predicting its impact on the flow of water and transport of sediment, to build a predictive model of riparian ecosystem dynamics. By using plant functional groups (i.e., guilds), our model accounts for process linkages among streamflow properties, physical processes, and plant community response. The model relies on a series of flow response curves built and tested with data collected along semiarid, canyon-bound rivers in Colorado. We built 2D hydrodynamic models and updated them with a flexible vegetation module to represent plant-hydraulic interactions for three study reaches. Plant guild distributions are well described by the model while predictions of the occurrence and direction of topographic change are less deterministic. Our work is among the first to develop response curves for both physical and ecological processes in the same framework. The shape of the resulting curves indicate that the functioning of riparian ecosystems is driven by nonlinear relationships and that clear, identifiable thresholds exist. As such, changes to the flow regime will have a differential impact on physical and ecological processes, depending on the nature of the shift. We discuss the strength and limitations of our model and make suggestions about its applicability to river management.

AB Physical screens are commonly installed to prevent downstream moving fish from entering dangerous areas (e.g. intakes to hydropower turbines, irrigation canals, and fish farms), and divert them to preferred alternative routes (e.g. bypass systems). In northern temperate regions, assessments of the functioning of screens have largely focused on diadromous species (e.g. salmon and eel), while ignoring those with other life history characteristics. Recent developments in physical screens include the usage of horizontally aligned bars as opposed to traditional vertical ones, but a direct comparison in terms of guidance remains untested. To address this and aid in the development of successful screens for the wider fish community, this study compared the efficacy of wedge-wire screens with horizontally and vertically oriented bars to block and divert downstream moving groups of five chub (Squalius cephalus) to a bypass channel installed in a recirculating flume under two discharge regimes. Hydrodynamics differed between horizontal and vertical screens under both flows; the vertical configuration created a higher velocity gradient towards the bypass. Total guidance (the number of bypass entries as a percentage of the number of approaches) was generally low (mean = 17.3% for all treatments), the highest being recorded for the horizontal screen under low discharge (25.3%). Rejections and holding station events, both proxies for fish exhibiting avoidance of the hydrodynamic conditions created by the screen, were lowest under this treatment. Horizontal performed better than vertical screens in guiding fish to the bypass under low but not high discharge. The results confirm that screen functioning is dependent on hydrodynamic conditions as well as the fish's behavioural response.

TI Relationship between design parameters and removal efficiency for
   constructed wetlands in China
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Review
DE Constructed wetlands; Design parameter; Removal efficiency; Regression
   analysis; China
AB Constructed wetlands (CWs), as an important ecological engineering technology, are designed and built to utilize the natural functions of wetlands for wastewater treatment within a more controlled environment. CWs have been widely used across the world. This review specifically aims at analyzing design parameters, pollutant removal efficiencies and their relationships for CWs built in China. The ANOVA analysis indicated that the design parameters and pollutant removal efficiencies were significantly different in different types of CWs and in different wastewater sources, and that wastewater sources should be considered as important factors for design of CWs operating parameters. Regression analysis of design parameters and pollutant removal efficiencies showed that regression equations were Logarithmic for total suspended solids (TSS), Power for ammonium (NH3-N), Compound for total nitrogen (TN) and Linear for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (CODcr) and total phosphorous (TP). However, the correlation index (R-2) was quite low because of poor correlativity between design parameters and removal efficiencies, probably because of the diverse nature of the data analyzed. The application of CWs is most appropriate and beneficial in decentralized wastewater treatment in small town and rural areas as well as for low polluted water of rivers and lakes due to low costs for construction, operation and maintenance.

AB Natural regeneration and reforestation have been widely adopted to improve the degraded soil and promote ecological services in the karst regions of southwestern China. A better understanding the effects of different vegetation types on soil quality and the nutrient limiting factors is very important for each approach. In this study, a secondary forest (SF) and two plantations, Eucalyptus maideni F. V. Muell. (EM, exotic, deciduous broad-leaved) and Pinus yunnanensis Franch. (PY, native, conifer species), were selected in the karst graben basins of southwest China to explore the soil quality using Total Data Set (TDS) and Minimum Data Set (MDS) methods. The results indicated most soil parameters showed significant differences between the different recovery approaches. The TDS method is more precise than the MDS method, but the MDS method can also adequately represent the TDS method for the evaluation of soil quality with different vegetation restoration schemes. In the MDS method, soil organic carbon, available potassium, ammonium nitrogen, acid phosphatase, microbial metabolic quotient, and the Pielou index of the soil microbes were found to be the most important indicators for assessing soil quality. The pure plantation of PY had a negative effect on the soil quality, causing soil nutrient deficiency, compared to the SF and EM plantation, indicating that natural regeneration may be a more effective approach to the amelioration of soil quality in the karst areas. These findings provide an empirical and theoretical basis for the protection, restoration, and management of forest in the degraded karst areas.

AB Nowadays swine slurry management is a very important environmental issue. Sludge treatment reed bed systems are sludge treatment systems based on constructed wetlands.
   The present study characterizes via 16S rRNA gene high-throughput the bacterial communities contained in untreated swine slurry and treated swine slurry by means of mesocosm-scale sludge treatment reed beds receiving different slurry loadings.
   The bacterial community composition varied between the treated and untreated slurry, with a notable slurry loading influence also observed. Richness, diversity and ordination measurements of the studied communities evidenced profound differences between the untreated and treated swine slurry bacterial communities; and only slight differences among the treated swine slurry communities. Interestingly, the slurry loading allowed to define two groups: mesocosm communities residing in the highest hydraulic slurry loadings and other mesocosm communities. The pH value emerged as an important community composition, diversity and ordination predictor.
   The functional bacterial community composition was predicted through the in silico approach. Results confirmed that the main nitrogen cycle metabolic pathways were present in the mesocosm communities with ammonification and assimilatory nitrate reduction as the most commonly detected nitrogen pathways in treated swine slurry.

AB Numbers of human-made reefs in the world's oceans are increasing, yet questions remain about patterns and speed of fish colonization of these artificial reefs. Here, we tested 1) whether the fish community on a newly deployed artificial reef converged with the fish community on an adjacent, established artificial reef over time and 2) whether fish colonization of the new artificial reef occurred sequentially. To answer these questions, we simultaneously collected time-lapse videos of fishes colonizing a new (2 wks old) artificial reef and those inhabiting a nearby (438 m away) established (> 20 yrs old) artificial reef. We found that fish community composition on the new artificial reef converged with the fish community composition on the established artificial reef over five months. Community development on the new reef followed a trajectory: schooling, planktivorous fishes initially colonized the reef in high numbers, whereas demersal fishes exhibited delayed colonization. These findings suggest that fishes may colonize human-made reefs along a specific trajectory of pelagic fishes followed by demersal fishes and that community convergence between reefs can occur over relatively short temporal scales given similar environmental conditions. When deploying additional structures, including human-engineered habitats, in the marine environment, our findings on fish colonization of artificial reefs are important to consider because they provide new insight into how artificial structures can be utilized to enhance particular fishes over different temporal scales.

AB Several routes are available for the downstream migration of silver eels in the river Rhine system. Very different effects on migration success can result from this choice, such as speed and migration duration or escapement rate. We studied the downstream migration of silver eels in a river section with two different routes. The first route is the initial and old riverbed, with two dams equipped with two rather small or medium sized hydropower plants (HPPs) located at the beginning and at the exit of the bypass stretch. Both HPPs have small bar spacing (10 mm and 20 mm, respectively) and the second HPP has two downstream bypasses. The second route is a power canal, supplying four major HPPs (maximum discharge capacity = 1400 m(3) s(-1)) and a nuclear power plant with cooling water. Firstly, this study focused on highlighting the factors influencing route choice. Secondly, we focused on the consequences of this choice. We demonstrate that water current management in the old riverbed at the study site had a 40% higher negative effect on eel survival than that by a consecutive passage in four turbines.

AB Drug shops and pharmacies have long been recognized as the first point of contact for health care in developing countries, including family planning (FP) services. Drug shop operators and pharmacists should not be viewed as mere merchants of short-acting contraceptive methods, as this ignores their capacity for increasing uptake of FP services and methods in a systematic and collaborative way with the public sector, social marketing groups and product distributors. We draw on lessons learned from the rich experience of earlier efforts to promote a variety of public health interventions in pharmacies and drug shops. To integrate this setting that provides convenience, confidentiality, access to user-controlled contraceptive methods (i.e., pills, condoms and potentially Sayana Press) and a gateway to clinic-based FP services, we propose three promising practices that should be encouraged in future interventions to increase access to quality FP services.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare 12-month continuation rates for subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) administered via self-injection and DMPA-IM administered by a health worker in Uganda.
   Study design: Women seeking injectable contraception at participating health facilities were offered the choice of self-injecting DMPA-SC or receiving an injection of DMPA-IM from a health worker. Those opting for self-injection were trained one-on-one. They self-injected under supervision and took home three units, a client instruction guide and a reinjection calendar. Those opting for DMPA-IM received an injection and an appointment card for the next facility visit in 3 months. We interviewed participants at baseline (first injection) and after 3 (second injection), 6 (third injection) and 9 (fourth injection) months, or upon discontinuation. We used Kaplan-Meier methods to estimate continuation probabilities, with a log-rank test to compare differences between groups. A multivariate Cox regression identified factors correlated with discontinuation.
   Results: The 12-month continuation rate for the 561 women self-injecting DMPA-SC was.81 [95% confidence interval (CI).78-.84], and for 600 women receiving DMPA-IM from a health worker, it was.65 (95% CI.61-.69), a significant difference at the.05 level. There were no differences in pregnancy rates or side effects. The multivariate analysis revealed that, controlling for covariates, self-injecting reduced the hazard for discontinuing by 46%. A significant interaction between injection group and age suggests that self-injection may help younger women continue injectable use.
   Conclusions: The significant difference in 12-month continuation between women self-injecting DMPA-SC and women receiving DMPA-IM from a health worker which remains significant in a multivariate analysis suggests that self-injection may improve injectable contraceptive continuation. Implications: While injectable contraceptives are popular throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa, they have high rates of discontinuation. This study is the second from an African country to demonstrate that self-injection may improve injectable continuation rates and may do so without increasing the risk of pregnancy or adverse events.

AB Objective: To evaluate the 12-month total direct costs (medical and nonmedical) of delivering subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) under three strategies facility-based administration, community-based administration and self-injection compared to the costs of delivering intramuscular DMPA (DMPA-IM) via facility- and community-based administration.
   Study design: We conducted four cross-sectional microcosting studies in three countries from December 2015 to January 2017. We estimated direct medical costs (i.e., costs to health systems) using primary data collected from 95 health facilities on the resources used for injectable contraceptive service delivery. For self-injection, we included both costs of the actual research intervention and adjusted programmatic costs reflecting a lower-cost training aid. Direct nonmedical costs (i.e., client travel and time costs) came from client interviews conducted during injectable continuation studies. All costs were estimated for one couple year of protection. One-way sensitivity analyses identified the largest cost drivers.
   Results: Total costs were lowest for community-based distribution of DMPA-SC (US$7.69) and DMPA-IM ($7.71) in Uganda. Total costs for self-injection before adjustment of the training aid were $9.73 (Uganda) and $10.28 (Senegal). After adjustment, costs decreased to $7.83 (Uganda) and $8.38 (Senegal) and were lower than the costs of facility-based administration of DMPA-IM ($10.12 Uganda, $9.46 Senegal). Costs were highest for facility based administration of DMPA-SC ($12.14) and DMPA-IM ($11.60) in Burkina Faso. Across all studies, direct nonmedical costs were lowest for self-injecting women.
   Conclusions: Community-based distribution and self-injection may be promising channels for reducing injectable contraception delivery costs. We observed no major differences in costs when administering DMPA-SC and DMPA-IM under the same strategy. Implications: Designing interventions to bring contraceptive service delivery closer to women may reduce barriers to contraceptive access. Community-based distribution of injectable contraception reduces direct costs of service delivery. Compared to facility-based health worker administration, self-injection brings economic benefits for women and health systems, especially with a lower-cost client training aid. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of self-injected subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) compared to health-worker-administered intramuscular DMPA (DMPA-IM) in Uganda.
   Study design: We developed a decision-tree model with a 12-month time horizon for a hypothetical cohort of approximately 1 million injectable contraceptive users in Uganda to estimate the incremental costs per pregnancy averted and per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. The study design derived model inputs from DMPASC self-injection continuation and costing research studies and peer-reviewed literature. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from societal and health system perspectives and conducted one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of results.
   Results: Self-injected DMPA-SC could prevent 10,827 additional unintended pregnancies and 1620 maternal DALY5 per year for this hypothetical cohort compared to DMPA-IM administered by facility-based health workers. Due to savings in women's time and travel costs, under a societal perspective, self-injection could save approximately US$1 million or $84,000 per year, depending on the self-injection training aid used. From a health system perspective, self-injection would avert more pregnancies but incur additional costs. A training approach using a one-page client instruction sheet would make self-injection cost-effective compared to DMPA-IM, with incremental costs per pregnancy averted of $15 and per maternal DALY averted of $98. Sensitivity analysis showed that the estimates were robust. The one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that the costs of the first visit for self-injection (which include training costs) were an important variable impacting the costeffectiveness estimates.
   Conclusions: Under a societal perspective, self-injected DMPA-SC averted more pregnancies and cost less compared to health-worker-administered DMPA-IM. Under a health system perspective, self-injected DMPA-SC can be cost-effective relative to DMPA-IM when a lower-cost visual aid for client training is used. Implications: Self-injection has economic benefits for women through savings in time and travel costs, and it averts additional pregnancies and maternal disability-adjusted life years compared to health-worker administered injectable DMPA-IM. Implementing lower-cost approaches to client training can help ensure that self-injection is also cost-effective from a health system perspective. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Client and provider experiences with self-administration of subcutaneous
   depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) in Malawi

ID SAYANA(R) PRESS; PROSPECTIVE COHORT; ACCEPTABILITY; INJECTION; SENEGAL;
   FEASIBILITY; UGANDA
AB Objective: As low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) consider adding self-administration of subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) to their contraceptive method mix, learning about family planning clients' and providers' experiences with self-injectable DMPA-SC during trials will inform introduction and scale-up efforts.
   Study design: We conducted semistructured interviews with 30 randomly selected adult women enrolled in the self-administration group of a 12-month randomized controlled trial studying DMPA-SC continuation rates in rural Malawi. We asked about their experiences learning to self-inject, self-injecting, remembering when to reinject, and storing and disposing of DMPA-SC. We also interviewed 12 providers clinic-based providers (CBPs) and community-based health surveillance assistants (HSAs) who trained clients to self-inject DMPASC during the trial. We asked about their experiences training and supporting women to self-inject DMPA-SC during the trial and their recommendations for scale-up of self-administered DMPA-SC.
   Results: Clients and providers reported positive experiences with DMPA-SC self-injection. Clients felt that DMPASC self-injection saved them time and money, and providers felt that it reduced their workload and saved them time. We found that both CBPs and HSAs successfully trained clients to self-inject DMPA-SC and that clients safely and appropriately stored and disposed of DMPA-SC.
   Conclusions: Our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence of the feasibility of DMPA-SC self-injection in LMIC settings. We recommend that providers plan to train clients for at least 30 min, emphasize the activating and injecting steps during training, use up to four practice injections per client trained and give self-injectors calendars to help them remember when to reinject.
   Implications: DMPA-SC self-administration should be made available in LMIC settings, but because it is a new practice, implementation guidance is needed. We offer practical recommendations for introducing and scaling up DMPA-SC self-administration based on clients' and providers' experiences during a trial investigating this practice in Malawi.

AB Objectives: Given the promise of DMPA-SC to increase community-level access to modern contraception in developing countries, we conducted an observational study to assess the acceptability and feasibility of DMPA-SC self injection among women in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and of medical/nursing (M/N) students as instructors for self-injection.
   Study design: Women who selected DMPA-SC at a community outreach event adjacent to a health center were interviewed upon acceptance (baseline) and then 3, 6 and 12 months later.
   Results: Of 850 clients selecting DMPA-SC at baseline, 640 (75.3%) opted for self-injection over being injected by the M/N students for reasons of convenience and personal agency. Among these 640 self-injectors, 47.5% were anxious at baseline (for fear of needles or injecting incorrectly). Over 80% reported feeling very ready after training, confident that they knew how to self-inject and confident that they would remember the next injection date. By 3 months, 97% described it as easy. Half (54%) experienced side effects, mainly menstrual irregularities, the main reason for discontinuation. At 6-month follow-up, self-injectors cited effectiveness and ease of use as positive elements, though one quarter reported side effects. Their impressions of M/N students as instructors were highly positive.
   Conclusions: Where DMPA-SC was free and easily accessible, the majority of women interested in DMPA-SC opted to learn self-injection. The M/N students performed well in instructing women to self-inject. Clients were highly satisfied with the services received, yet many did not recognize their student status, possibly because outreach occurred near a health facility. Once told, clients remained very favorable, suggesting strong motivation to receive their preferred contraceptive free, whoever the provider.
   Implication statement: This study provides additional evidence on the acceptability and the feasibility of the self injection of DMPA-SC by users from a resource-limited setting. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objectives: In 2015, private healthcare providers in Nigeria introduced DMPA-SC (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate administered subcutaneously) into the method mix. We aimed to [1] examine the sociodemographic predictors of continued DMPA-SC use after 3 months, and [2] characterize the additional influences of contraceptive counseling quality and experiences of side effects on continuation.
   Study design: From March to August, 2016, we conducted phone interviews with a convenience sample of women obtaining DMPA-SC from selected providers to survey them about their experience obtaining an initial dose of DMPA-SC. Study coordinators contacted women again about 3 months later after when they were due for reinjection. We used logistic regressions to examine the likelihood of having obtained a subsequent dose of DMPA-SC at follow-up as predicted by sociodemographic characteristics, a quality of counseling indicator based on responses to a 14-item scale, and reports of side effects experienced.
   Results: Of the 541 DMPA-SC users who completed the first survey, 311 were reached again via phone after 3 months to conduct a second survey. Multivariate results for sociodemographic predictors of continued DMPASC use show that those with some college education or more (OR=2.79; 95% CI: 1.09-7.14), and those with four or more children (OR=2.89; 95% CI: 1.09 0 7.67) were more likely to obtain another dose. Our summary quality measure showed that women overall rated the quality of their initial counseling session high. Logistic regressions indicated that higher quality during the initial counseling session is related to the likelihood of getting another dose of DMPA-SC (OR-=2.04; 95% CI: 1.12-3.47) whereas experiencing more bleeding reduced the likelihood of continuation after 3 months (OR=0.15; 95% CI: 0.07-0.34).
   Conclusions: Among urban Nigerian women, both counseling quality and experiencing side effects were important factors in predicting continued use of DMPA-SC after 3 months. These findings are consistent with previous studies of DMPA and injectable contraception continuation.
   Implications: New contraceptive methods that are designed for increased access and ease of use, combined with high quality provision, have potential to increase contraceptive use in settings with low levels of contraceptive prevalence. Higher quality counseling can help encourage women's continuation of a new injectable contraceptive method at 3 months. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objectives: The subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) injectable contraceptive was introduced in South West Nigeria in 2015 through private sector channels. The introduction included community-based distribution and was supported by a social marketing approach. From program monitoring and evaluation, aimed at understanding performance, market reach and other process measures, we identify lessons learned to inform future scale-up efforts.
   Methods: We synthesized the findings from a core set of key performance indicators collected through different methods: (1) implementer performance indicators, (2) phone survey of DMPA-SC users (n=541) with a followup after 3 months (n=342) and ( 3) in-depth interviews with 57 providers and 42 users of DMPA-SC.
   Results: Distribution of DMPA-SC to private providers was concentrated in states with large urban populations. A shift toward focusing on high-volume family planning facilities coincided with a rapid increase in distribution in late 2016. Users reached in the phone survey were generally older and married with children; few were under age 25. Users and providers reported favorable opinions of DMPA-SC. Many users reported choosing DMPA-SC due to recommendations from providers and friends, and the hope of experiencing reduced side effects compared to other methods. While users reported positive experiences interacting with community-based distributors, the delivery model encountered a number of challenges high turnover, low motivation, lack of an appropriate compensation package and logistical costs and was ultimately disbanded.
   Conclusions: In the DMPA-SC introductory program in Nigeria, distribution was amplified when focused on high volume contraceptive providers. Although community-based distribution can be one effective service delivery model for reaching underserved populations, more consideration for balancing cost recovery and public health goals through private sector approaches are needed in the context of South West Nigeria. Additional communications and outreach efforts are needed to reach younger, unmarried users with contraceptive services. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objectives: The objective of this research is to assess the acceptability of the provision of subcutaneously administered depo medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) by nonclinically trained community health workers (CHWs) among acceptors in the rural province of Lualaba in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
   Study design: In 2017, 34 CHWs received training in provision of DMPA-SC. Among other methods, DMPA-SC by CHWs was offered during household visits and at community outreach events. The initial survey included questions on acceptors' demographic characteristics, contraceptive use history and experience with provision of DMPA-SC by a CHW. The follow-up included questions about side effects experienced and continuation of DMPA-SC by a CHW.
   Results: Seventy-four percent of initial acceptors of DMPA-SC (N=252) were first-time contraception users. Almost all (96.0%) felt very comfortable with a CHW performing the injection rather than a physician or nurse, and 97.6% perceived that the CHW was very comfortable performing the injection. A total of 239 women were interviewed at follow-up. Most expressed satisfaction with the method despite some side effects experienced. Almost all acceptors (97.9%) were satisfied with the information provided by CHWs, and 93.8% were satisfied with the overall service. Most (96.4%) would choose to continue receiving DMPA-SC by a CHW rather than in a health clinic, and 95.2% would recommend DMPA-SC by a CHW to a friend.
   Conclusions: Overall, administration of DMPA-SC by CHWs is acceptable to users in Lualaba. DMPA-SC can be safely provided within the community after proper training.
   Implications: This study validates the use of CHWs (without clinical training) to provide DMPA-SC in a rural sub-Saharan African setting. It also represents an important step in obtaining official MOH authorization for the scale-up of this mechanism of distribution to other underserved regions in the DRC. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB Background: Nigerian policymakers are debating task-shifting injectable contraceptive services to Patent and Proprietary Medicine Vendors (PPMVs).
   Methodology: One hundred fifty-two PPMVs were trained to provide injectable contraceptives in Oyo and Nasarawa states. Data were collected before and 1, 3 and 9 months posttraining. 2 tests were conducted to assess associations between survey time points.
   Main findings: Few PPMVs had the necessary knowledge to provide injectables pretraining. A majority demonstrated increased knowledge after the training. Knowledge required for screening and counseling clients was lower than knowledge on administration.
   Conclusion: PPMVs should be trained before providing injectable services. Additional research is needed on the benefits of job aids for screening and counseling. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The HIV integrase enzyme is a validated drug target. However, its potential has remained largely unexploited until recently due to lack of structural and mechanistic information. Its catalytic core domain (CCD) is crucial for the viral-human DNA integration making integrase an ideal target for inhibitor design. However, in order to do so, force field parameters for the integrase magnesium ion need to be established. Quantum mechanical calculations were used to derive force field parameters which were validated through molecular dynamics studies. Our results show that the parameters determined accurately maintain the integrity of the metal pocket of the integrase CCD.

AB Small angle neutron scattering study reveals that below the isoelectric point of the globular protein lysozyme and in the presence of different divalent (Mg2+, Ca2+ and Ba2+) and monovalent (Na+) ions, the long-range repulsive and the short-range attractive interactions decreases and increases respectively with the increase of salt concentration. In addition with these short- and long-range interactions, fractal aggregates also form even in pure lysozyme solution by a very small amount ( approximate to 0.5%). Protein-protein interactions are mostly dominated by the fractal structure factor only for Na+ and Mg2+ ions at higher salt concentrations as more aggregates are formed.

AB Homogeneous nanoparticles of Li4Ti5O12 are prepared by solid-state method assisted with codoping of Mg and Zr. In this present study, orthogonal test is taken and the optimal case is Li3.9Mg0.1Ti3.95Zr0.05O12 heated at 750 degrees C for 10 h. We find temperature and Mg ions are the more powerful factors on particles size and morphology. The results show Li3.9Mg0.1Ti3.95Zr0.05O12 have the most fine particles with diameters distributed in the range of 10-100 nm and have relatively good rate capacity and cycling stability. Moreover, Li3.9Mg0.1Ti3.95Zr0.05O12 first discharge capacity is 186.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.57C, the pure Li4Ti5O12 is 164.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.57C. The electrochemical of Li3.9Mg0.1Ti3.95Zr0.05O12 improved obviously.

AB The X-1 Sigma(+ )state of MgO shows significant differences between the CCSD(T) and CCSDT results and even some significant differences between the CCSDT and CCSDTQ results. The CCSDT(Q) results for this state do not agree well with the CCSDTQ results, as has been found for other systems. Unlike the X state, the a(3)Pi state, which is well described by a single configuration, shows much less dependence on level of correlation treatment. Despite the slow convergence of the valence treatment of the X state, the effect of core correlation converges rapidly with level of correlation treatment.

AB Vertically Aligned Carbon Nanotube arrays (also termed as VACNTs or CNT forest) have recently found to be transformable to a reflective mirror from a naturally black absorber. The feature of improved reflectance can be attained by the controllable tip bending process using the bottom surface of a rotated cylindrical tool (the process called micro-mechanical bending (M2B)). In this paper, the polarized light reflectance of bent and compacted region of the CNT forest using M2B method has been investigated. We observed that reflectance from the processed CNT zone was highly dependent on the angle of incidence and polarization state of the incident laser. For the first time, the refractive index of the tip bent CNT forests by M2B method was investigated and found to be in a range of similar to 1.8.

AB The choice of optimal calculation method for frequency-dependent polarizabilities (FDPs) is important for many applications. We compare some density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio methods with the quantum defect theory (QDT). Since QDT incorporates the experimental energy spectrum, it should yield more reliable results for FDP near the resonances at the excited states. We show that the DFT and ab initio methods which demonstrate the best accuracy for the static polarizabilities, have poor accuracy of the excited states energies. Such a behavior is a source of some discrepancies between these methods and QDT technique.

AB Based on all-cis-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluor-ocyclohexane C6H6F6 (1), a new class of excess electron compounds, alkaline-earthides, Li-1-M (M = Be, Mg and Ca) with extremely large nonlinear optical (NLO) responses has been designed. Alkaline-earth M plays an important role in obtaining pretty small transition energies (0.520-0.621 eV) between the ground state and the crucial excited state. Consequently, the alkaline-earthides have large first hyperpolarizabilities (beta(0)) up to 3.51 x 10(6)au. Our results indicate that the alkaline-earthides may be a novel idea for designing for high-performance NLO materials.

AB Conversion pathways of prism-C-16 with a D-8h structure to a monocyclic C-8h structure on the potential energy surfaces (PES) were elucidated by quantum chemical calculations. Eight four-membered rings on the side faces of prism-C-16 were broken successively to yield finally a monocyclic C-8h ring, which was found to be the global minimum of C-16. Quantum chemical exploration of PES gave more than two thousands of isomeric structures and transition structures. Intrinsic reaction coordinates along reaction pathways were studied to obtain reaction mechanisms from the linear C-16 structure to cyclic forms.

AB Selection of temperature sequence and bias factor is a critical step for the preparation of Parallel Tempering simulations in a Well-Tempered Ensemble (PT-WTE). We provide a scheme in this study to generate the temperature sequence and the corresponding bias factor optimally. The number of replicas for a complete coverage of a specific temperature range is adjustable in this scheme, while keeping the average acceptance probability (AAP) between neighboring replica-pairs unchanged. Two series of PT-WTE simulations were tested with the number of replicas as 16 and 8 respectively. This work leads to a better understanding and application of PT-WTE simulations.

AB Two mechanisms of formation of long-lived negative molecular ions in TCNQ at resonant electron capture were considered for the case of the nonzero captured electrons. The first mechanism concerned with the ions lying in energy lower than the first molecular triplet was related to inter-systems crossing process providing formation of the long-lived ions with quartet multiplicity. The second mechanism, which yields high lifetime of the ions lying above the first triplet, was determined as a mixing of ion electronic states with the ground state contribution. The results give more knowledge of the long-lived negative ions formation.

Quantum mechanical calculations of energies, geometries and vibrational parameters of DCMDC were done for the first time using density functional theory (DFT) applying B3LYP method with 6-311 + + G(d,p) basis set of Gaussian'09 package. Natural bond orbital (NBO) calculation and AIM analyses were performed to elucidate intra-molecular interactions and delocalisation of electron density within the molecule. Molecular docking studies were carried out using Schrodinger software to find the anti- microbial activity and revealed that DCMDC has potential antifungal activity.

AB Attempt has been made to explain why different aliphatic quaternary ammonium tribromides (QATBs) show different levels of efficiency in bromination reactions. For this study, tetrabutyl ammonium tribromide (TBATB, [N(C4H9)(4)]Br-3), and cetyl trimethyl ammonium tribromide (CTMATB, [N(CH3)(3)C16H33]Br-3) were used as representative examples. UV-Vis Spectroscopic method was employed to measure the thermodynamic parameters of the reactions. Influence of quaternary ammonium cation on tribromide (Br-3(-)) performance was assessed with the aid of Density Functional Theory (B3LYP/6-311 + + G(d,p)) by determining the dissociation energy of the QATBs, energies of pairs of their frontier orbitals, which are HOMO and LUMO and calculation of dipole moments.

AB The vibrational features of 4-fluorobenzonitrile in the first electronically excited state S-1 and cationic ground state D-0 have been studied by two-color resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization and mass analyzed threshold ionization spectroscopy. Most of observed vibrations in the S-1 and D-0 states are related to in-plane ring deformation and CN bending motions. The band origin of the S-1 <- S-0 transition and adiabatic ionization energy of 4-fluorobenzonitrile are determined to be 36,616 +/- 2 and 78,000 +/- 5 cm(-1), respectively. These data provide insight into the substitution effect of fluorine atom and cyano group on the transition energy.

AB The thermal rate constants for the methyl formate hydrogen abstraction reaction by deuterium was investigated by the multipath canonical variational transition state theory with large curvature tunneling (MP-CVT/LCT). The multistructural torsional anharmonicity factor decreases the thermal rate constants for deuterated reaction R1a and increases considerably for R2a. The path-averaged generalized transmission coefficient is dominated by the characteristics of the lowest-energy paths for both reactions. The MP-CVT/LCT rate constants are in excellent agreement with experimental data (T = 1079-1270 K).

AB The photodissociation of H2O2 dilute in argon at 193 nm has been investigated using near infrared frequency modulation laser absorption spectroscopy on selected rotational lines of the OH vibrational overtone bands between 6500 and 7100 cm(-1) to detect the OH and HO2 radical products with the same laser. Sequential OH and HO2 time-dependent profiles have been measured at room temperature and total pressures ranging from 3 to 56 Torr. Kinetic analysis gives the product distribution following H2O2 photolysis of (82 +/- 1) % OH and (18 +/- 1) % HO2 under the present conditions, in excellent agreement with previously reported measurements.

AB The application of the Restricted Active Space Self Consistent Field (RASSCF) quantum chemical method using an extended active space and including sigma-sigma, pi-sigma and pi-pi dynamical electron correlation shows that the transition state structure for the automerization reaction of cyclobutadiene is an isosceles trapezium. This transition state is obtained without any symmetry constraints. The calculated energy barrier height involving the zero point vibrational energy corrections is 9.62 kcal.mol(-1) (0.417 eV), with the corresponding rate constant being equal to 0.18 x 10(9)s(-1) (or 7.1 x 10(10)s(-1) in case of using the vibrational energy splitting tunneling method).

ID CLASSICAL DYNAMICS; QUANTUM; DISTRIBUTIONS; OH+CD4
AB In 2005, Kopin Liu and co-workers used crossed molecular beam and velocity map imaging technics in order to measure pair-correlated product speed distributions for the OH + CH4 reaction and seven isotopic variants. We recently reproduced half of them with good accuracy by means of the classical trajectory method in a quantum spirit, which takes into account the semiclassical quantization of product vibrational motions. The second half are successfully reproduced here by using the same approach. The present results constitute one more proof of the ability of the classical trajectory method to provide satisfying predictions for polyatomic processes provided that a few quantum constraints are included in the calculations.

AB We present first-principles combined GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation on passivation effect between ODC(I) and H/F atoms. The injection of H or F atoms help to form the robust Si-H or Si-F bond which increase the optical band gap, erase the defect state of ODC(I) at 0.74 eV and improve radiation toughness. The reaction of ODC(I) defect with a H atom or F atoms is barrierless, the Si-O length near the ODC(I) sites are all gradually getting shorter and bond energy are getting stronger. Coupled with the atomic structures and electro-optic properties, we found out that F is the better passivator.

AB Based on the fact that the Hamiltonians of the Coulomb many-particle systems are always factorized we develop the two different approaches for analytical solution of the Schrodinger equation written for arbitrary few- and many-particle Coulomb systems. The first approach is the matrix factorization method. Another method is based on the D+-series of representations of the hyper-radial 0(2,1)-algebra. The both these methods allow us to obtain the closed analytical formulas for the bound state energies in an arbitrary many-particle Coulomb system.

It was identified by means of the single crystal X-ray diffraction and characterized using different physicochemical studies to gain deeper insight in its structure. The determination of the crystal structure showed that the compound crystallizes in monoclinic system with the space group P2(1), lattice parameters a = 11.3061 angstrom, b = 20.9911)angstrom, c = 12.2711 angstrom. The UV-Vis shows a good transmittance in the visible range, with an absorption threshold at 255 nm. The thermal behavior divulges a good thermal stability up to 230 degrees C.

AB The sublimation enthalpy of 1-aminoadamantane was estimated using the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) model. An equation has been proposed that describes the relationship between the sublimation enthalpy and computed crystal density, molecular surface area plus four quantities obtained from the surface electrostatic potential. The coefficients in this equation were determined from least-squares fitting to reliable values of sublimation enthalpy of 23 adamantanes. The sublimation enthalpies estimated by MEP model agree within 4 k.J-mol(-1) for all compounds, except for 1-aminoadamantane. The reason for a large difference between experimental and estimated sublimation enthalpy of 1-aminoadamantane is discussed.

AB In recent years, the application of mulch on machine operating trails has gained popularity as a method of reducing post-harvest soil erosion and water runoff following ground-based harvesting operations. Three treatments immediately applied after ground-based skidding operations were sawdust mulch (SM), water diversion structure or contour-felled log erosion barrier (WDS), and untreated/bare trail (U) in May 2011. At the time of skidding, weather conditions had been very dry and warm. The SM treatment was manually spread on the entire trail surface at a rate of 3.65 kg m(-2). WDS was created by placing felled logs with diameters ranging from 25 to 30 cm and 4 m in length in a perpendicular direction to the skid trails with the distance between adjacent WDS set at 10 m. This study aimed to determine and compare the effectiveness of three treatments on the recovery of soil physical properties from compacted soil caused during logging operations over a six-year period (from May 2011 to July 2017) in the Hyrcanian forest, north of Iran. Soil bulk density, total porosity, penetration resistance, and rut depth (wheel rut) were measured to assess the recovery process on three abandoned skid trails with varying longitudinal gradients (10%, 20%, and 30%) exposed to different levels of machine traffic (low, medium, and high). On trails with a 10% gradient, the highest recovery values of bulk density (7.8%) and total porosity (8.5%) were observed in the SM treatment, while on the steepest gradients (20 and 30%), the highest recovery values of bulk density (10.9%) and total porosity (12.9%) were found in the WDS treatment. The average recovery of penetration resistance for soil located in the SM and WDS treatments was 19.1% and 10.5%, respectively. Average rut depth recovery, expressed in percent of post-harvest values, was higher on all trail gradients subjected to the WDS treatment (30.6%) as compared to the SM treatment (13.1%). In general, values of soil bulk density, total porosity, penetration resistance and rut depth continued to show signs of machine-induced disturbance over the 6-year monitoring period, compared to the undisturbed area as a benchmark.

AB Loss of shallow water riparian zones in the St. Clair River has reduced availability of nursery areas and refuge for fishes. To remediate habitat losses and provide fish nursery areas, five remediation projects were carried out along the river's United States bank from 2012 to 2014, replacing seawalls with sloping banks and adding instream structure (e.g., root wads and boulders). Project evaluation is necessary to determine success, however there is no standard sampling protocol for shallow habitat in large rivers, especially when both adults and juvenile fishes should be targeted. Therefore, to assess remediation effectiveness and suggest appropriate sampling techniques for large river shorelines, we employed a multi-gear sampling strategy targeting multiple fish species and life history stages at five shoreline remediation and four control sites. We collected juvenile fishes with minnow traps and backpack electrofishing and adult fishes with gillnets. Poisson models were used to evaluate catch per unit effort (CPUE) differences between remediation and control sites for species of management priority (e.g., game fishes and rare species) and taxonomic groups. Model estimates were then used to calculate proportional abundances and compare species composition between site types. Results indicated that electrofishing CPUEs of Darters, mottled sculpin Comas bairdi, rare threatened and endangered species, and juvenile and adult Centrarchidae were higher at remediation sites than at control sites. Additionally, juvenile Centrarchidae and mottled sculpin had a higher proportional abundance in electrofishing collections at remediation sites than at control sites. In contrast, CPUEs and proportional abundances were similar for all taxonomic and management priority groups of fish collected in minnow traps and gillnets. Electrofishing captured more species and more individuals and is therefore a valuable sampling technique for large river shorelines. Nevertheless, addition of minnow traps and gillnets allowed for a more comprehensive assessment of fish assemblages. Overall, this multi-faceted survey approach demonstrates that shoreline remediation projects were beneficial to recreational and ecologically important species in the St. Clair River.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of initial pH (pH(i) = 4.0-7.0), current density (j = 10-40 A/m(2)), initial phosphorus (P) concentration (C-i of 5.01-52.13 mg/L) and electrocoagulation (EC) time (t(Ec) = 10-100 min) on phosphorus removal from domestic wastewater by a batch EC reactor using hybrid aluminium (Al)-iron (Fe) anodes and titanium cathode. Phosphorus removal from domestic wastewater containing 52.13 mg/L PO4-P was obtained to be 99.99% at optimum conditions (pH(i) = 4, j = 20 A/m(2) and EC time = 80 min). The energy and electrode consumptions at optimum conditions were calculated as 3.422 kWh/m(3) and 0.328 kg/m(3), respectively. The amount of removed P per electrochemically dissolved total metal electrode (q(e)) was calculated as 55.69 mg P/g, while the dissolved metal to removed phosphorus ratio (M-e/P, mol/mol) was 4.40 (Fe/P = 2.63 and Al/P = 1.77) at optimum conditions. It can be concluded that phosphorus removal by hybrid Al-Fe anodes is as effective as using only Fe or Al anodes as per the results present in literature. In addition, the effluent pH after EC treatment process at optimum conditions was 8.8, hence requiring no pH adjustment before discharge.

AB The development of cascade hydropower in the Yalong River has changed the hydrological regime of the river and sharply reduced the Coreius guichenoti population dwelling downstream of the JinPing II power station. In this paper, an eco-hydrological index system for C. guichenoti habitat was constructed based on Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) and Environment Flow Components (EFC), which aimed to coordinate the processes of ecological hydrological and water temperature variations to guarantee the oviposition of C. guichenoti. The analysis revealed that the suitable rise rate and fall rate intervals, which are dimensionless parameters, were 0.05-0.10 and 0.01-0.03, respectively, during the spawning period. The rise and fall durations were both 1-2 days, the cycle of water fluctuations was 3-5 days, the flow pulse duration was 5-7 days, the flow pulse rise rate was 0.56-0.65, and the flow pulse fall rate was 0.23-0.50. Then, the Instream Flow Incremental Methodology (IFIM) method was used to calculate the ecological base flow during the C. guichenoti spawning period. Moreover, the ecological flow regime for C. guichenoti downstream of the JinPing II power station during the spawning period was determined based on eco-hydrological indicators and water temperature requirements. These results showed that the ecological flow regime could not only guarantee oviposition but also meet the drifting conditions required for eggs, and therefore, the ecological operation of diversion-type hydropower stations and cascade hydropower stations needs to be given more attention to provide suitable spawning conditions in target fish habitats.

AB Slow growing, massive stony corals have often been overlooked in reef-restoration activities, despite their resilience to climate change and contribution to reef framework. Techniques to effectively propagate and outplant these species have proven challenging. However, advancement in methodology may increase rates of success. In 2013, Orbicella faveolata and Montastrea cavernosa fragments were outplanted on reefs in the Florida Keys at a nearshore and offshore location, to determine whether "microfragmenting" corals, the process of creating similar to 1 cm(2) fragments, increased outplant survival and growth compared with larger fragments (16-64 cm(2)).
   Arrays of eight microfragments were planted near one larger fragment of similar size at each location. Six replicate pairs were haphazardly placed within each similar to 700 m(2) study site. Fragments at both sites were monitored for growth and survival over 31 months, spanning two bleaching events. Initial predation occurred on microfragments, but was absent in the larger fragments. Survival and growth differed between sites, but did not differ between the larger fragments and microfragment arrays. However, excluding plots with > 40% predation at the nearshore site showed that O. faveolata microfragment arrays produced 10 times more tissue than traditionally used larger fragments. Results from this study suggest that if predation events are reduced, massive corals can be successfully grown and outplanted for restoration purposes.

AB Wood particle biofilters are being used for remediation of nitrate in watercourses but so far, have received little attention for the possibility of phosphorus (P) treatment. Phosphorus export in many agriculture and urban stressed watercourses however, is dominated by particulate rather than dissolved P and particulate P is potentially treatable by physical filtration. Five low cost, highly permeable media types, including woodchips, sawdust, bark mulch, corn cob chips and peastone, were tested in eight pilot scale biofilters over a six month period for their ability to remove suspended solids (TSS) and particulate P from turbid stream water. The biofilters were operated at high loading rates, with retention times averaging 1.9-4.2 h and achieved TSS removal averaging 85-97%. Excluding a 30 day startup period, seven of the eight biofilters removed an average of 53-64% of stream total P (TP) averaging 65.6 mu g/L. The corn cob media provided lower TP removal (1%) because P leached from the media. These filters provided TP removal at hydraulic loading rates that were an order of magnitude higher than when similar media is used for nitrate remediation. These low cost filter media, with capacity for high loading rates, could offer a practical solution for P removal in urban storm water ponds, sewage lagoons and agriculturally impacted water courses.

AB Effects of low-head diversion dam spillways on survival and injury of fish passing downstream are poorly understood, especially for fragile, early life stages. The ubiquitous nature of diversion dams in waterways worldwide led us to assess survival and injury rates for small and large size-classes (nominal mean total lengths 25 and 50 mm, respectively) of morphologically general fishes: fathead minnow Pimephales promelas; hybrid rainbow x cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss x O. clarkii, hereafter trout); and small razorback sucker Xyrauchen texanus. Fish were released in three laboratory spillway models: a 5.7-m-high, free-impinging overfall spillway (0.023 m(3).s(-1).m(-1)) with three stilling basin depths; a 5.4-m-high, smooth-faced ogee-shaped spillway; and the ogee-shaped spillway fitted with energy dissipation steps. Ogee-shaped spillway flows were 0.012-0.24 m(3).s(-1).m(-1). Mean survival proportion, corrected for handling mortality, was high in all models (0.97-1.0) for all species, size-classes, and flow conditions, except in the free-overfall spillway with stilling basin depth of 2.5 cm, where survival was lower (0.78-0.94). Survival rates of fathead minnows and trout were similar in the stepped and smooth spillway experiments, and across all flow levels. Survival of razorback suckers was slightly lower in the stepped than the smooth spillway but differences were likely due to poor fish condition, which may have also reduced their survival at the highest flows in ogee-shaped spillway models. The free-overfall spillway caused negligible injury to small fish if receiving pool depth was 15 cm or deeper. Injury rates in the stepped spillway were slightly higher than in smooth one, but serious injuries were rare. Although mortality and injury rates to fish after passage over the spillway models were typically low, higher cumulative rates from passage over many diversions indicates managers should use structures that reduce injury and mortality rates wherever possible.

AB Soil and Water Bioengineers using plants for civil engineering purposes are faced with challenges to determine the interrelation of dynamic and architectural properties of riparian trees. This study aims to improve the characterization of young riparian trees (Salix purpurea L.) in the framework of such an eco-engineering approach. Dimensioning the mechanical effects of a complex multilevel system in a temporal and spatial context is a key issue understanding the plant-fluid interaction. We investigated the natural frequency (f(n)), the damping ratio (zeta) and the architectural properties of three 4 year old purple willow specimens. From a tree architectural point of view, we found a clear distinction of the specimens in terms of the distribution of the projected area along the tree height, and for the slenderness ratio over the axes orders. The foliage of the specimens had a significant impact on the damping ratio depending on the tree architecture. A high slenderness ratio across the tree axes increased the flexibility of the branching system, and reduced the share of the foliage impact on the damping ratio. In comparison, a low slenderness ratio led to a stiffer tree structure, and therefore the damping ratio, due to the aerodynamic drag of the leaves, had received a higher share of the total damping ratio. Linking tree architectural analysis with its dynamic properties proved to be helpful in advancing the physical characterization of complex riparian trees.

AB This study evaluated the influence of influent surface organic loading (SOL) and aeration mode on nitrogen removal and N2O emission in subsurface wastewater infiltration systems (SWISs). Aeration developed appropriate oxygen conditions, which resulted in high COD, NH4+-N and TN removal and enhanced the abundances of amoA, nxrA, napA, narG, nirS, nirK, qnorB and nosZ under SOL rate of 21.2 and 33.8 g COD/(m(2)d) compared to the non-aerated SWIS. N2O emission decreased with influent SOL rate increasing in non-aerated and aerated SWISs. The SWIS with intermittent aeration had a better performance on TN removal and lower N2O emission compared to the SWIS with continuous aeration under the same SOL rate. It could conclude that intermittent aeration is a feasible method to win high influent SOL rate, high TN removal and low N2O emission for SWISs.

AB On the premise of maximizing nitrogen elimination in wastewater and recharging the effluent directly to groundwater, two groups of subsurface wastewater infiltration systems (SWIS), a turfgrass-covered system (S-G) and a bare soil system (S-B), were examined under a pollution load of 600 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) to investigate the contribution of turfgrass in removing sewage nitrogen. The results showed that compared with S-B, the concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) in S-G effluent were significantly lower. In 2014 and 2015, the average concentrations of NO3--N in S-B effluent were 38.9 and 36.8 mg L-1. None of the NO3--N concentrations in S-B effluent satisfied the international standard for drinking water (10 mg L-1 NO3--N). While the average concentrations of NO3--N in S-G effluent in 2014 and 2015 were 2.96 and 0.80 mg L-1, the proportions of NO3--N concentrations in S-G effluent, which were below 10 mg L-1 NO3--N, were 87.7% and 97.9%, respectively. The TN removal efficiency and removal quantity of the S-G were significantly higher than those of the S-B. In 2014 and 2015, the TN removal quantities of S-G were 646 and 647 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, and the TN removal efficiencies reached 98.1% and 99.1%, for which the contribution efficiencies of turfgrass on nitrogen removal were 52.5% and 61.0%, respectively. Meanwhile, the TN removal quantities of S-B were 269 and 204 kg ha(-1) yr (-1), and the TN removal efficiencies were 40.7% and 31.3% in 2014 and 2015, respectively. These obtained results indicated that plants play an important role in SWIS under these conditions.

AB Topographic heterogeneity affects abiotic and biotic components of vegetated ecosystems and has the potential to provide functions and services such as promoting floral and faunal biodiversity. Yet, few studies have documented the design, implementation, and outcomes of mound-type features in estuarine and tidal freshwater wetland restoration projects. Here we report data from a synoptic survey of soil temperature and moisture on mounds at tidal wetland restoration sites in the Pacific Northwest, together with the results of a literature review, and the insights of regional restoration practitioners regarding ecological and practical considerations for mound construction. Few papers reviewed addressed conditions for plant establishment on mounds, such as soil moisture, which is important in climates with annual dry seasons, like the Pacific Northwest. We report 2015 data on soil moisture and temperature for the tops, sides, and toes of 15 mounds constructed between 2001 and 2013 of fill dirt, or dirt and logs, at 5 tidal wetland restoration sites. Two of the restoration projects studied are located in the lower Columbia River and estuary, one is in the Puget Sound, and two are in outer Pacific coastal estuaries in Oregon. The heights of mounds ranged from 0.5 m to 1.5 m above the marsh plain, and the area of individual mounds ranged from 21 m(2) to 5185 m(2), while most published information treated somewhat smaller topographic features (termed mounds, hummocks, tussocks, ridges, levees, fans, or terraces). Differences in the minimum and maximum values of moisture between the toe and the top of mound in summer ranged from 2.9% to 40%. Statistical analysis strongly suggested stratification of soil moisture by elevation. Analysis of soil temperature was less conclusive, but temperature appeared to be positively correlated with elevation. Soil moisture relative to mound aspect (cardinal direction) was significant in some cases, but inconsistent between mounds. We also report our observations from a third recent restoration project on the tidal Columbia River, and observations made by other practitioners who have designed and installed mounds from San Francisco Bay to northern Puget Sound. Our findings will support design of wetland restoration sites where topographic heterogeneity is an objective.

AB The management of rivers for navigation, hydropower and flood risk reduction involves the installation of in-channel structures. These influence river levels and can affect groundwater flow within hydraulically-connected riparian floodplain aquifers. A comprehensively monitored, peri-urban, lowland river floodplain in the southern United Kingdom was used to explore these dependencies and to examine the implications for the flux exchange of water and nitrate between the river and the floodplain alluvial aquifer. The study demonstrated that rivers maintained at high levels by management structures, result in raised groundwater levels in the adjacent aquifer and complex groundwater flow patterns. Engineered river management structures were shown to promote flow from river to aquifer through the river bed but the majority of the associated nitrate was removed in the hyporheic zone. High-nitrate groundwater recharge to the alluvial aquifer also occurred through overbank flood flows. Across the floodplain, substantial denitrification occurred due to anaerobic conditions resulting from carbon-rich sediments and the shallow water table, the latter linked to the river management structures. An upper limit on the total annual mass of nitrate removed from river water entering the floodplain aquifer was estimated for the study site (2.9 x 10(4) kg), which was three orders of magnitude lower than the estimate of annual in-channel nitrate flux (1.8 x 10(7) kg). However, this capacity of lowland floodplains to reduce groundwater nitrate concentrations has local benefits, for example for private and public water supplies sourced from alluvial aquifers. The insights from the study also have relevance for those considering schemes that include the installation, removal or redesign of river management structures, as the resultant change in groundwater levels may have consequences for floodplain meadows and the nutrient status of the aquatic system.

AB The mechanism of intramolecular charge transfer (CT) and the following radiationless dynamics of ofloxacin pharmaceutical product were investigated using femtosecond absorption spectroscopy combined with quantum chemical calculations. The CT and the intersystem crossing (ISC) processes have been established to be the major relaxation pathways responsible for the ultrafast nonradiation of the excited S-1 state. The CT occurs within a time constant of similar to 1.4 ps. The following ISC is determined to be similar to 158 ps and triplet yield can be measured to keep similar to 0.33. Simultaneous, the quantum yields of CT and triplet-triplet state absorption are contributed to be 0.29 and 0.38, respectively.

ID BOROPHENES; ALUMINUM; DENSITY
AB An optimization strategy combining global semi-empirical quantum chemistry search with all-electron density functional theory was adopted to determine the lowest energy structure of B19Al clusters. B19Al is a nearly perfect planar, which is remarkably different from that of tubular neutral B-20 cluster. The Al atom occupies a peripheral position of the planar, which results from the difference in atomic size and cohesive energy between aluminum and boron atoms. Meanwhile, the planarity of B19Al cluster is attributed to s-p(2) hybridization. Some properties, including chemical bonding, HOMO-LUMO gaps, molecular orbital distribution, electric dipole moments, and charge transfer and distribution, are discussed. The doped planar boron clusters can be created by doping with Al atom.

SEM images show that the pore density is up to 1.2 x 10(7) per square centimeter. The difference of XPS spectra about survey, Ga 3d and N 1s between the non-etched and freshly etched GaN surface can be explained the formation of Ga(BF4)(3).

AB A simple hydrothermal method is adopted to prepare ternary Mn doped ZnO nanoparticles uniformly grafted on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets. The effect of Mn doping on ZnO/RGO nanocomposite has been investigated using different characterization techniques. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images clearly show the uniform distribution of nanoparticles on RGO sheets. The doping of Mn in ZnO/RGO composites have been confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Photocatalytic activities of as-prepared samples were examined by the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and Congo red (CR) under sun light. The prepared ternary heterojunction photocatalyst exhibit the excellent photocatalytic activity for degradation of RhB (degradation rate nearly 99% within 140 min) and CR (degradation rate nearly 100% within 160 min) under sunlight irradiation which is higher than that of binary ZnO/RGO heterojunction. The improved photocatalytic performance of the ternary nanocomposite can be ascribed to extend solar light absorption, enhanced adsorption of the composite catalyst surface and efficient charge separation of photo-induced electrons.

AB The paper studies the transfer of the oxygen atom O from the NO2 molecule to the CO molecule, resulting in the formation of CO2. The methods of quantum mechanics are used to obtain transition states, vibrational frequencies and reaction paths CO + NO2 <-> CO2 + NO, and their key energy characteristics. Two mechanisms of the reaction are determined: a direct one and a stepwise involving the formation of a stable intermediate complex. The rate constants of forward and backward reactions were calculated within the framework of the transition state theory. They are compared with the experimental data available in the references. Their approximations are presented in the form of Arrhenius in a wide temperature range of 300-2500 K.

AB Low temperature hydrothermal method was used to produce a large surface area ZnO NRs on conductive glass. The same method was used to fabricate a photoelectrode of Ag2S quantum dots onto the nanorod arrays. Ag2S QDs/ZnO NRAs heterostructure was employed as photoanode in a standard 3-electrodes photoelectrochemical cell. A significant enhancement in the photoelectrochemical performance was observed for the Ag2S QDs/ZnO upon heat treatment 400 degrees C which displayed an impressive photoconversion efficiency of 4.08% by achieving similar to 10-times higher compared to bare ZnO NRAs. This enhancement was attributed to the improved morphological structure, crystallinity and optical properties of the synthesised heterostructures.

AB We propose a novel technique to prepare carbon fibers from cotton fibers while retaining the unique hollow structure of these natural fibers. We were able to introduce micropores and mesopores into the hollow structure by using zinc nitrate as an activating agent. We revealed that the porosity of the obtained carbon fibers and the pore size increase as the concentration of the activating agents is increased. Moreover, the obtained carbon fibers were applied in electric double-layer capacitors and found to exhibit excellent performance due to the rapid ion transport through the hollow cores and nanopores.

AB Ab initio MP2/aug'-cc-pVTZ calculations demonstrate that protonation of N-Base:ClOH complexes at O leads to complexes (N-Base-Cl)(+):OH2, as a traditional N center dot center dot center dot Cl halogen bond is replaced by a chlorine-transferred Cl center dot center dot center dot O bond. For a fixed base, the binding energies of the latter complexes are more than an order of magnitude greater than the former. As a function of the Cl-N distance, EOM-CCSD Cl-N coupling constants show the evolution of the traditional halogen bond in the N-Base: ClOH complexes, to a chlorine-shared halogen bond in N-2:ClOH2+, to a covalent bond in (N-Base-Cl)(+):OH2. (1)J(Cl-N) values for these complexes resemble (1)J(Cl-N) for the ions (N-Base- Cl)(+).

AB The first-principle method based on the density functional theory (DFT) was used to calculate the electronic structure and optical properties of pure, N-doped, Ni-doped and Ni/N co-doped rutile TiO2 systems. The band structures, electronic density of states and spectral absorption coefficients were calculated after geometrically optimizing the above TiO2 systems. The results show that there are impurity energy levels appear within the band gaps of Ni-, N-doped systems, which provided by N-2p orbit and Ni-3d orbit; meanwhile, more complicated impurity energy levels appear within the band gaps of N/Ni co-doped rutile TiO2. The co-doped rutile TiO2 has a better optical absorption efficiency and stronger absorption cut-off wavelength red-shift. Which can be caused by the hybridization of Ni-3d orbit and N-2p orbit provides local impurity levels, so that electrons transition occurred from the valence band maximum to the impurity levels and also from the impurity levels to the bottom of conduction band, which contributes to the electron transition and enhances the absorption performance of rutile TiO2.

AB Internal and external magnetic fields due to pressure-driven ionic currents inside a two-dimensional nanoslit are obtained theoretically and numerically by finite element solution of governing equations, i.e., Poisson-Nernst-Planck, Ampere, and Navier-Stokes equations. The transport governing equations in this study are non-dimensionalized by Debye screening length, and discretized in a two dimensional finite length nanoslit. The magnetic field components have opposite signs above and below the nanoslit due to opposite directions of the Amperian closed path. Within the nanoslit the non-uniformity of ionic currents resulted in non-uniform magnetic fields however outside the nanoslit, magnetic fields remain relatively constant, independent of the distance from a sufficiently long and wide nanoslit. It is anticipated that non-invasive ionic/streaming current measurements can be conducted by external magnetic fields readouts in sufficiently long and wide nanoslits. For instance, to estimate electrical properties (zeta potential) of solid-liquid interface, and to accurately sequence DNA and biomolecules.

AB A systematic DFT study on production selectivity of Cu single-crystal surfaces are performed at electrochemical interfaces to gain the origin of CO2 electroreduction into C-1 and C-2 species. The results show that CO is a common intermediate on Cu(1 1 1) and Cu(1 0 0) surfaces, and its further reduction is the crucial selectivity-determining step. Simultaneously, a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism is proposed for CO dimerization and the reason for pathway selectivity is explained by geometry analysis. The present studies will provide theoretical support for C-1 and C-2 species formation mechanisms and the rational design of Cu-based alloy electrocatalysts that are active at a lower overpotential.

AB A natural biosorbent prepared from wheat bran (WB) and multiple quaternary ammonium salts (MQAS) was used to remove dye (AR-18) from aqueous solution. The adsorption kinetics and thermodynamic mechanism of the adsorption of AR-18 on MQAS-WB were also examined. Results reveal that adsorption isotherm data can be well described by Langmuir model. The calculated thermodynamic parameters indicate that the adsorption is exothermic and spontaneous. The adsorption kinetics follows the pseudo-second-order model. MQAS-WB shows potential for large-scale wastewater treatment. Dynamic adsorption studies reveal that the dye removal efficiency of the packing column of MQAS-WB is higher than that of raw WB.

AB The combination of self-consistent field theory and density functional theory was extended to investigate the self-assembly behaviors of amphiphilic diblock copolymer/nanoparticle mixture in dilute solution. The presented theoretical system includes solvophobic-solvophilic diblock copolymer and solvophobic nanoparticles, where the nanoparticles are attractive to solvophobic blocks and repulsive to solvophilic blocks. The dumbbell-like micelles were discovered at low loading of nanoparticles, while the sphere-like micelles were formed at relative high loading of nanoparticles. It was found that the nanoparticles favor the center of the cores in the dumbbell-like micelles but prefer to localize in an internal shell between the center of the cores and solvophobic/solvophilic interfaces in the sphere-like micelles. It also revealed that the morphology transformation from dumbbell-like micelles to sphere-like micelles is entropy-driven. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The interaction of CH4 gas molecule on pure graphene and Al, B, N, P doped mono-vacancy graphene by using the density functional theory (DFT) to explore their potential applications as gas sensors. The results demonstrate that the system of Al doped mono-vacancy graphene is the most stable, and Al-doped mono-vacancy graphene performs the largest adsorption energies upon CH4 with the most appreciable effects on the electronic structures. In addition, the adsorption of CH4 can largely enhance the conductivity of these graphene. In summary, we believe that the Al-doped mono-vacancy graphene could be a promising candidate material for the CH4 gas sensors.

AB Pendrin (SLC26A4) is a protein associated with the auditory system. Pendred syndrome (PDS) and DFNB4 are typical auditory disorders caused by mutations in the SLC26A4 STAS domain. We generated an SLC26A4 STAS domain model and six mutated STAS domain models related to PDS, DFNB4, and PDS/DFNB4 by homology modeling. Molecular dynamics simulation was performed to find the equilibration conformation and fluctuation information. Using fluctuation information, we calculated betweenness centrality and edge betweenness to reveal communication between secondary structures of STAS domain. The edge betweenness results showed that mutated models generate communication signals that are less clear than WT models.

AB The dissociation dynamics of ClN3 have been studied by ab-initio classical trajectory and static potential energy surface calculations. The energies and structures of molecular isomers and transition states are obtained from optimization. Three isomers and five transition states of ClN3 are identified, and it is confirmed that the cyclic-N-3 can be generated directly dissociation from one of isomers and from bending linear-N-3 after dissociation. The classical trajectories simulations provide the ultrafast formation dynamics of cyclic-N-3 during the dissociation, and the calculation of dissociation dynamics of ClN3 provides us a new insight on the pathway of formation cyclic-N-3 from molecules.

AB Calcium monohydride is an astronomically important molecule. Despite the long history of work on this molecule, discrepancies still exist between experiment and theory for the higher vibrational levels of the B/B'(2)Sigma(+) state. We report on rotational-vibrational-electronic transitions to the B/B'(2)Sigma(+) state which we have assigned to the B/B'(2)Sigma(+) (v = 9, 10, 11 and 18) - X-2 Sigma(+) (v = 0) transitions. The energy spacing of the higher lying vibrational levels of the B/B'(2)Sigma(+) state alternates strongly with vibrational quantum number as predicted by the coupledchannel calculations of Carlsund-Levin et al. (2002). We confirm that this alternation extends all the way from v = 9 to v = 20.

AB An abiotic synthesis of nucleobases from amino acids is of critical importance as it sheds a light on potential pre-life chemical reactions. However, information about reaction pathway is often not available directly from laboratory experiments. In contrary, computational simulations allow to learn chemical transformations directly. In the present study, we investigated one of promising routes of uracil synthesis from cysteine, using density functional theory at the M06-2X/6-311G(d,p) level. We suggested that the solvent (urea) facilitates the reaction acting as self-catalyst. Proposed reaction pathway involves seven reactions with the highest activation energy barrier equal to 42.8 kcal/mol.

AB F-19 NMR spectra are simulated for blue phase I of FPHG( St(1.5)*Ap (1.5)) based on a model of a double-twisted substructure inside cylinders that form a body-centred cubic lattice. A kinetic matrix is included to describe jump processes over quarter pitch lengths. Though the lines in the NMR spectra are broad and featureless, changes in the widths and positions with temperature are well described by the blue phase model structure. The spectra in the chiral nematic N* phase are also simulated. Dynamics in the BP I are found to be slower than in the N* phase.

AB In this work a novel, low-cost and simple method is used for synthesis of calcium hydroxide nanoparticles having dumb bell like morphology. The composition and purity of the product are analyzed by X-ray diffraction analysis. The morphology of the product is analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The formation mechanism of dumb bell shape from trigonal unit cells is also proposed here. The thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity and specific heat of product are measured in 303-533 K temperature range. Thermal conductivity increases from 0.49 to 0.69 W/mK with increase in temperature from 303 to 533 K. The thermal diffusivity decreases from 79.0 to 46.2 mm(2)/s with increase in temperature from 303 to 333 K and it increases from 46.2 to 53.2 mm(2)/s with increase in temperature from 333 to 533 K. Specific heat of product is sharply increased from 3.1 to 5.4 MJ/m(2) K on increasing temperature from 303 to 333 K temperature. Moreover the physical and combustion characteristics of fuel (diesel) are studied at 0, 10, 20 and 40 ppm dosages of product. The calorific value of fuel is increased from 0.95 to 41.93 MJ/kg with increase in additive dosage from 0 to 40 ppm. Flash point and fire point of fuel are increased by 7.5 and 9.5 degrees C with addition of 40 ppm additive respectively. Specific gravity is increased from 0.1149 to 0.3472 g/cm(3) by increasing the additive dosage from 0 to 40 ppm. Kinematic viscosity of fuel is increased from 2. 68x10(-6) to 3.2 x 10(-6) m(2)/s with increase in additive dosage from 0 to 40 ppm.

AB We characterize structures and electronic excitation of domains from a bacteriophytochrome-based infrared fluorescent protein carrying a covalently bound biliverdin chromophore using the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods. We show that geometry optimization at the density functional theory level and application of the extended multiconfigurational quasidegenerate perturbation theory in quantum subsystems allows us to achieve high calculation accuracy for the model systems mimicking the red-adsorbing and the farred-adsorbing protein forms. Specifically, discrepancies between experimental and theoretical excitation energies are less than 0.05 eV (similar to 20 nm) for the Q-band in both protein forms.

AB Graphene quantum dots exhibit unique electronic and optical properties due to their combined properties of quantum confinements and edge effects and have broad applications like bio-imaging, drug delivery, biosensors and photovoltaic applications. In this paper, we presented a facile and green preparation of pristine graphene quantum dots (PGQDs) from graphite using a shear-assisted supercritical CO2 approach. The effects of the pressure, graphite amount, and shearing speed on the yield of the PGQDs were investigated. The fluorescence quantum yield of the PGQDs achieved 8.6%, and it was highly stable with blue light emission. The mechanism for forming the PGQDs was elucidated.

AB With the rapid demand of white light emitting diodes (w-LEDs), studies on the ultraviolet/near-ultraviolet (UV/NUV) light excited phosphors are becoming more and more important. Herein the novel Na3GdP2O8: Re3+ (Re = Sm, Dy) phosphors were synthesized through a high-temperature solid-state reaction method. The Sm3+-doped Na3GdP2O8 phosphors emitted orange-red light centered at 600 nm, under the NUV excitation at 403 nm. When excited at 350 nm, the Na3GdP2O8: Dy3+ phosphors presented a white light emission, including three peaks at 483, 578, and 670 nm, respectively. In addition, both of the Na3GdP2O8: Sm3+ and Na3GdP2O8: Dy3+ phosphors showed excellent thermal stability at different temperatures, of which the emission intensities at 150 degrees C could maintain about 75% and 79% of those at room temperature, respectively. These results indicate that the as-prepared phosphors can be considered as potential candidates for applications in UV/NUV excited wLEDs.

AB Observation of infrared emission following two-photon absorption has been widely employed to detect atomic oxygen O(P-3(J)) so far. In the present study, a method of detecting O(P-3(J)) with vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) instead of infrared emission has been developed. The scheme of detection is (i) 2p(3)3p P-3(J) <-<- 2p(4) P-3(J) (UV two-photon absorption); (ii) 2p(3)3p P-3(J) -> 2p(3)3s S-3 (transfer to the S-3 state); and (iii) 2p(3)3s S-3 -> 2p(4) P-3(J) (VUV emission). The present method is favorable under the conditions at high ambient pressures because the effect of undesirable collisional quenching is smaller than that on the detection of infrared. An application to the kinetic measurement relevant to O(P-3(J)) also has been demonstrated.

AB We studied the effects of heme distortions on the chemical properties in two protein classes, oxidoreductases and oxygen carrier proteins, in the Protein Data Bank by a combination of statistics and quantum chemistry. A statistical analysis of heme distortion provided the characteristic distortions. They were reasonably correlated with the redox potentials and oxygen affinities evaluated by quantum chemical calculations, implying that heme proteins utilize these distortions to enhance their functions. The combination of statistical analysis and quantum chemical calculations is useful for the elucidation of the structure-function relationships.

AB A theoretical study of linear YX center dot center dot center dot CO complexes (in which YX are diatomic interhalogens or hydrogen halide) has been performed to high-level quantum chemical calculations. Calculations show that at the equilibrium geometry, the stabilizing effect that arises from the Pauli exclusion principle is more important than the electrostatic interactions. In addition, the stabilizing terms of the LMOEDA scheme increase with the sigma-hole magnitude, being the exchange term the most affected one, followed by electrostatics, polarization and dispersion components. The PAEM function measured on the X center dot center dot center dot C interatomic interaction line gives a measure of the covalence of these interactions.

AB Graphene encapsulated MnO nanorods, with a diameter of 60-120 nm and length of 1-1.5 mu m ( MnO@rGO) was synthesized. When evaluated as an anode material for LIBs, the MnO nanorods could not only better accommodate the huge volume change compared with bulk MnO during cycling, but also provide one dimensional charge transportation pathways. Meanwhile, graphene could efficiently alleviate the stress caused by volume change of MnO and improve the electrical conductivity. As a consequence, the as-obtained MnO@rGO hybrid delivers a high reversible capacity of 545 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) after 150 cycles, demonstrating its promising application in LIBs.

AB Hydrogen abstraction by NO2 from asymmetric methyl ethers by NO2 is theoretically investigated based on first-principles calculations in order to constrain their combustion models, including methyl ethyl ether(MEE), methyl n-propyl ether (MNPE), methyl i-propyl ether (MIPE), methyl n-butyl ether (MNBE), and methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE). We obtain the rate constants and branching ratios at 500-2000 K, and the dependence of reactivity on ether sizes and the reaction sites on the ethers. The cis-HONO channel is the most important one, followed by the HNO2 and trans-HONO channels. On the hand, the size of alkyl and the reaction site significantly affect the reactivity. Hydrogen abstraction mainly occurs at the C site (adjacent to the ether bond) of the long-chain alkyl. Moreover, the linear Bell-Evans-Polanyi correlation is observed for the hydrogen abstraction reactions between the asymmetric methyl ether and NO2.

AB Boron-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (B-MWCNTs) were synthesized, treated with hydrochloric acid, "piranha" solution, and decorated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). B-MWCNTs were characterized using Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron-and transmission electron microscopy, and electrochemical techniques. The results exhibit enhanced response and sensitivity of B-MWCNTs upon modification with AuNPs. Analysis of dopamine (DA) and epinephrine (EP) in presence of uric acid (UA) was investigated on B-MWCNTs/AuNPs in pig blood serum. Limits of detection of 0.20 and 0.30 mu M were estimated for DA and EP, respectively. The findings demonstrate that B-MWCNTs/AuNPs is proper for analysis of DA and EP under coexistence of UA.

AB The OH-group connecting bifurcated H-bond (HB) acceptors is one case of the three-centered HBs found in physical and biological systems. An example is the transition state of molecular reorientation jump mechanism in liquid water, ionic solutions, and hydration shells of biomolecules. In this Letter, the orientational time correlation functions of these special OH-groups in water were studied by performing molecular dynamics simulations and using the normal-mode approach developed recently. The reorientation angle of the OH-group before entering the diffusive regime can be estimated through the plateau in the mean-square rotational displacement calculated by several methods.

AB In this article, cesium ions were introduced into the FeCo Prussian blue analogues (PBA) catalyst to increase the styrene conversion and the selectivity in styrene oxide in the reaction of epoxidation of styrene. The conversion of styrene over CsFeCoPBA-1 on the optimal condition reach up to 96%, in comparison to 88% over FeCoPBA. The catalysts were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and N-2 adsorption/desorption, respectively. To further illustrate the phenonmen, the detailed kinetic studies on epoxidation of styrene were carried out. It is found that the rate equations is similar between the catalyst CsFeCoPBA-1 and FeCoPBA, while the reaction activation energy with CsFeCoPBA-1 catalyst is reduced obviously. Meanwhile, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) had also been employed to directly probe thermodynamic changes during the formation of the PBA with or without Cs ions. It is noteworthy that higher enthalpy change in the presence of cesium ions.

AB AlNiCo-8 alloys were synthesized by annealing a mixture of Al/Ni/Co/Cu/Fe/Ti oxides and CaH2 in an inert gas environment. In four parallel experiments, the annealing temperature was controlled as 500, 600, 700 and 800 degrees C, respectively. The magnetic properties were investigated by VSM. The results showed when the temperature was below 700 degrees C, a higher reduction temperature was beneficial to both crystallization and magnetic properties. However, when the temperature was above 700 degrees C, all oxides were reduced, and a further increased temperature did not bring much extra benefits on crystallization or magnetic properties.

AB Water clusters are hydrogen bonded molecular assembly of water molecules. They have been extensively studied using experiments, ab initio calculations and molecular simulations. The molecular arrangement of water in water cluster provide significant insights into behavior of water in bulk, confinement and close to surfaces. Here molecular dynamics simulations of TIP4P/2005 water clusters are performed in weak electrid fields. These fields introduce additional forces of varying magnitude 0.1-25% of forces existing in without-field water clusters. Autocorrelation functions of distance, energy and velocities are analysed. Molecular arrangements in water clusters does not disintegrate under additional forces.

AB As observed at a world scale, in Reunion Island Heteropogon contortus savannas face major pressure and need to be preserved and restored. However, the use of this species in restoration projects is hampered by the limited knowledge about the seed germination ecology and more specifically about dormancy and light requirements. Dormancy state and light requirements for germination of H. contortus seeds were assessed over a 3-year afterripening period (Le. storage). Dormancy loss was observed after one year of storage. Between one and two years of after-ripening, H. contortus seeds exhibit significantly higher mean germination percentages in daily light than in darkness, demonstrating their positive photoblasty (Le. requires light for germination). Smoke solutions significantly enhanced germination in both daily light and darkness during the first two years of dry storage. This study also demonstrated that smoke-infused water with beekeeping smoker fuel could be an efficient method to enhance germination of H. contortus seeds. Overall, this method could be adopted for large scale restoration projects due to its efficiency, its low cost and its reproducibility.

AB Check dams are widely used for soil conservation at the watershed scale. When structurally sound, these engineering control works retain sediment as planned. However, there is limited information describing the influence of site characteristics on post-construction condition including structural stability and sediment retention capacity. More specifically, the effects of channel morphology, check dam geometry and vegetation characteristics as potentially influencing factors on sediment retention capacity at the watershed level are poorly understood. Thus, an investigation applying field and remotely sensed measurements, multi-regression models, redundancy and sensitivity analysis, and correlation analysis was conducted in a Mexican watershed where the characteristics of 273 check dams were evaluated 3-5 years after construction. Vegetation cover and dimensions of the channel were found to be the most important factors influencing check dam fate. Taller structures experienced the greatest failure risk, in contrast to lower and wider structures and associated vegetation cover that retained long and wide sediment wedges, which helped to stabilise the check dams. The potential sediment storage capacity of the check dams mainly depends on the downstream height of the structure, but also on the vegetation cover near the structure walls; check dams constructed across a range of channel dimensions are able to effectively store sediment. Overall, this study provides a quantitative evaluation of the dominant factors influencing the post-construction conditions of check dams and their ability to store sediment, and thus provides land managers insights into the best strategies for soil conservation at the watershed scale using check dams.

AB Nutrient contamination of waterways is a growing concern, instigating the emergence of floating treatment wetland systems (FTWs) to remove nutrients from water. To determine if aeration of water systems enhances nutrient removal efficacy or nutrient fixation within plant tissues, aeration in combination with FTW installation techniques were investigated. During two separate trials with Juncus effusus and Canna flaccida, treatments consisted of either aerated or non-aerated mesocosms, with varying coverage and planting density combinations. Aeration increased the dissolved oxygen levels within each mesocosm, but reduced the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from the water column in comparison to non-aerated systems. Plant samples collected from 100% planting density treatments that were aerated had a greater nitrogen uptake than non-aerated by as much as 55% or 13.5 g/m 2 at harvest. Some discrepancies between plant uptake and water column nutrient levels can be attributed to microbially-mediated nitrogen losses (e.g., denitrification).

AB The paper presents the results of a study of selected parameters of common osier (Salix viminalis) biomass sampled annually, over a 12-year period, from a constructed wetland wastewater treatment plant. The focus of the study was on parameters that were relevant to biomass energy management. The study was conducted in a constructed wetland wastewater treatment plant consisting of one horizontal flow bed with a total area of 186 m(2), planted with osier willows. The following biomass parameters were analysed: biomass yield, volume, humidity, ash content, higher and lower heating values, and contents of N, P, K in different parts of plant stems. The study showed that osier biomass harvested from the investigated constructed wetland system could be used as an energy source in thermochemical processes. The higher and lower heating values were similar to those obtained by other authors (18.13 and 17.38 MJ.kg(-1), respectively). The energy yield (17.49 MJ.m(-2)) and energy density (3486-5411 MJ.m(-3)) were also calculated. Young shoot parts had higher ash and micronutrient contents and lower energy parameters than old parts.

AB The relationships among soil C, N, and P, aboveground plants, and belowground organisms are well-known; however, the impact of the aboveground dynamics of plant communities and their ensuing effects on soil C, N, and P, particularly during secondary succession need clarification. This study explored the effects of plant functional composition and diversity on soil C, N, and P at different soil depths. Soil samples were collected at soil depths ranging from 0 to 60 cm from three grassland sites abandoned for 5, 17, and 30 years in the Yang Qing Chuan catchment. Soil properties and fine root biomass were determined for different soil depths, and the plant community characters at each site were also evaluated. The results revealed that the plant community transitioned from dominance by annual herb to dominance by perennial species during the succession, and the percentage of Leguminosae plants, plant diversity, and species richness increased with succession time. The soil water content, organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorous, C:P ratio, and N:P ratio increased significantly with successional time and decreased significantly with soil depth. In contrast, the soil bulk density and pH decreased significantly with successional time and increased significantly with soil depth. Furthermore, the plant functional group composition and diversity significantly affected soil C, N, and P contents and ratios, but was sensitive to the vertical stratification of soil. Plant functional group composition had a stronger correlation to soil C, N, and P contents and ratios at soil depths of 0-20 cm than that of the 20-60 cm depth primarily due to the fact that the nutrients returned are mostly concentrated on the topsoil and seldom deposited in the deeper soils. However, plant diversity had a stronger impact on soil C, N, and P contents and ratios at soil depths of 20-60 cm than at 0-20 cm depth, because plant diversity exacerbates interspecific competition and forces the roots to grow deeper, which alters nutrients in the deep soil. In addition, the percentage of legumes can be used as a practical indicator of soil quality in the 0-20 cm layer during natural succession of abandoned farmlands. This study provides evidence that plant communities have a strong influence on soil C, N, and P, but that the pathways and degree of influence differ across vertically stratified soil.

AB Amorpha fruticosa is often used to revegetate saline wasteland in the YinNan Irrigation Area, northwest China. However, the survival rate of transplanted A. fruticosa seedlings is constrained by its low tolerance to high soil salinity, drought, and low soil temperatures (T-soil) at the early transplanting stage. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of three different mulches, including plastic mulch (PM), sand mulch (SM) and rice straw mulch (RSM), and control (CK) on the soil microenvironment and A. fruticosa seedling growth. The results indicated that PM (19.1-26.2 degrees C), followed by SM (18.6-26.1 degrees C), provided the highest T-soil at 0-20 cm depth during the whole growing period, while RSM (16.5-21.5 degrees C) exhibited lower T-soil than CK (15.8-22.0 degrees C) M all time except the later growing stage. RSM (7.1%-26.4%) retained soil water most effectively as compared to CK, followed by SM (3.2%-22.5%), and then PM (-0.6%-19.7%). PM (11.4%-18.5%) had the best performance in reduction of ECe M 0-80 cm depth, followed by RSM (10.5%-15.5%), and then SM (3.7%-7.4%). Still, PM exhibited the greatest improvement in soil structure. A. fruticosa seedlings grown in PM achieved the best stand establishment and growth characteristics, in which its root reached to 40-60 cm depth, while the counterparts in RSM showed the poorest performance in three mulching treatments. The results above suggest that PM is a promising strategy to promote the growth of transplanted halophytes in saline wasteland of the YinNan Irrigation Area and other areas with similar ecologies.

AB Constructed wetlands (CWs) is an effective way to removal nitrogen (N) from swine wastewater, which accompanying with the process of ammonia (NH3) volatilization. However, the removal pathway of NH3  volatilization has adverse impacts on the natural biogeochemical cycle of N. Here, this paper presents the first attempt to investigate the potential use of clinoptilolite in reducing NH3  volatilization in integrated vertical-flow constructed wetlands (IVCWs) treating swine wastewater. The NH(3 )volatilization flux was measured via steady-state chambers. Results showed that the removal rate of TAN (total ammonia nitrogen, NH3  and NH4+ -N) in clinoptilolite system was 96.1%, where 93.01% of that was removed by substrate adsorption, it was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that in quartz sand system (29.6%). Moreover, the microporous structure of zeolite is not conducive for the growth of denitrifying microorganisms. The NH3  volatilization flux covered a range of 0.02-3.00 mg N m(-2) h(-1), which was lower than the reported date. Furthermore, the proportion of NH(3 )volatilization in Clite was 0.99%, which was obviously lower (p < 0.05) than that in control (9.01%), and the ammonia volatilization quantities decreased by 180.7% in this study. Results suggest that clinoptilolite plays an important role in reducing NH3  volatilization to the atmosphere.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and diclofenac (DCF) in a mesocosm two-stage constructed wetland system consisting of a subsurface-flow bed (first stage; CW-1) and a surface-flow system (second stage; CW-2) with an emphasis on the effect of artificial aeration as a potential performance intensification option. Furthermore, the additional aim was to identify the transformation products of DCF and SMX along the flow path of the treatment system. This two-stage system was fed for 442 days with an artificial municipal wastewater containing DCF and SMX at a concentration of 2 mg/L each. The removal of SMX in the CW-1 was found to be significantly higher under non-aerated conditions ( > 77%) as compared to aerated conditions (26%), but the aeration of the CW-2 was insignificant for the SMX removal. In contrast, the removal of DCF was not affected by aeration in the CW-1 (removal efficiency of approximately 50%), but was significantly positively influenced by the combined effect of plants and aeration in the CW-2. The overall removal of SMX and DCF in the two-stage system was 95.8% and 77.6%, respectively. The transformation products of SMX and DCF detected in the studied system indicated the potential contribution of both oxic and anoxic transformation pathways, potentially including also abiotic reaction between SMX and Fe(II) leading to the cleavage of the isoxazole ring in this compound. Some of the transformation products found in the CW-1 were not further detected in the CW-2. Based on the literature data the antimicrobial activity and potential activity of the identified transformation products cannot be ruled out. Giant miscanthus growing in the CW-1 was unaffected by the high concentrations of DCF and SMX in contrast to the emergent macrophytes (on the floating island) or the free-floating plants present in the CW-2, which failed to adapt to the presence of the pharmaceuticals. As a result, the CW-2 was colonized by an unidentified species of a water moss and algae.

AB In an era where increasing urbanization is resulting in issues such as urban poverty, malnutrition and unemployment, urban agriculture is increasingly regarded as a multi-functional approach to addressing these issues. However, increasing water scarcity limits the feasibility of urban agriculture and hence alternative water sources for irrigation are required. While stormwater has the potential to be used for urban agricultural irrigation, stormwater contaminants can pose potential health risks. Thus, a column study was conducted to (1) determine whether biofilters planted with vegetable crops are capable of treating urban stormwater, and (2) identify the level of heavy metal uptake into various vegetable crops when irrigated with stormwater. The column study was conducted over nine weeks with nine vegetable species (broad beans (Vicia faba), kohlrabi (Brassica oleracea Gongylodes Group), kale (Brassica oleracea Acephala Group), lettuce (Lacwca saliva), mint (Mentha spicata), mustard spinach (Brassica juncea), radish (Raphanus sativus), spinach (Spinacia oleracea) and sweet corn (Zea mays)) irrigated with stormwater. The treatment function of the system was not compromised by the use of vegetable crops. 70% concentration reduction was achieved for Cu, Pb, Zn, Mn and Ni. The concentration of total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the effluent was reduce by up to 47% and 69%, respectively. Heavy metal accumulation was limited in the edible portions but the levels of Cd and Pb concentration exceeded the Food Standards for Australia and New Zealand and World Health Organization guideline values, deeming it unsafe for consumption. Cultivating vegetable crops in biofilters did not affect plant growth and the biofilter's stormwater treatment functions. However, heavy metal concentrations within plants does raise potential health concerns, requiring further studies to improve crop safety.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of loading frequency (1 pulse per day and 4 pulses per day) and vegetation (monoculture of Phalaris arundinacea 'Picta') on the removal and transformation of a mixture of pharmaceuticals diclofenac (DCF) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in lab-scale unsaturated vertical-flow constructed wetlands. Additionally, the system performance, the ecotoxicity of the wastewater (Microtox bioassay), and the microbial community structure and diversity in the top layer of the system were assessed. In the experiment, elevated concentrations of the pharmaceuticals (0.5 mg/L) were used to reflect the quality of wastewater from single houses or small settlements. The removal of DCF and SMX was deteriorated by the presence of Phalaris arundinacea 'Picta'. The lower loading frequency enhanced the removal of DCF and SMX only in the planted columns, suggesting combined effect of the two factors. For the unplanted systems no significant effect of the loading frequency was observed. The observed removal efficiency of SMX and DCF in the experiment was in the range 52.8-91.2% and 47.3-74.2%, respectively. The pharmaceuticals did not affect markedly the removal of DOC, TKN and N-NH4, but they reduced the bacterial diversity within the rhizosphere and in the adjacent substrate of the systems. The main transformations of SMX were (mono-, di-, tri-)hydroxylation, demethylation, deamination and formation of glutathione conjugates, whereas for DCF only trihydroxylation was observed. The toxicity of the raw and treated wastewater containing the pharmaceuticals was at a level comparable with the control samples. This study showed that vertical-flow constructed wetlands can be efficient in the removal of DCF and SMX. Given that the constructed wetlands are inherently planted systems, it is suggested that the loading frequency is the operational variable that could be adjusted to enhance the removal of these pharmaceuticals.

AB Worldwide, coastlines are becoming increasingly hardened by infrastructure in response to population growth, need for space, and coastal protection. Coastal and marine infrastructure (CMI) supports fewer species and lower abundance and diversity than analogous natural rocky habitats, which can alter community composition and ecosystem functioning. Efforts to develop ecological engineering solutions that offset these negative consequences on biodiversity while retaining engineering function abound, but to date few studies have investigated the role of multiple factors simultaneously driving patterns of biotic colonisation. Here, the role of surface heterogeneity, chemical composition and surface orientation was evaluated over a 6-month period. An increase in habitat heterogeneity, the replacement of shale for ground oyster shell (cue) and downward orientation was predicted to increase species richness, diversity and abundance. Orientation and heterogeneity greatly affected species richness, abundance, and community composition, and the inclusion of ground oyster shell (cue) increased bivalve recruitment but had only a marginal effect on community structure. Community formation was facilitated by low light but inhibited by sedimentation. On upward-facing surfaces, sediment accumulation on high complexity surfaces expanded niche heterogeneity, and supported communities comprised of burrowing polychaetes and predatory species. Surface orientation and heterogeneity are key factors influencing larval recruitment, and in supporting diverse benthic assemblages on artificial structures. These factors should be considered during the design phase of new engineering projects if the negative consequences of artificial structures are to be minimised while ensuring engineering function is maintained.

AB Estuarine storm surge barriers are designed to prevent the flooding of human-developed landscapes. While such barriers may have a range of ecological impacts, including the fragmentation of aquatic habitats and the alteration of water quality, their impact on obligate estuarine fishes is largely unknown. The sparid, Acanthopagrus butcheri, was used as a model species to determine how surge barriers may influence the movements of solely estuarine species and fish kill events. Individual A. butcheri were monitored for one year using passive acoustic telemetry in the Vasse-Wonnerup Estuary (south-western Australia), in which fish kills occur regularly during summer and autumn. Hydrological data and surge barrier operational information were used to make inferences on the movements and habitat use of A. butcheri. Individuals were largely restricted to the waters downstream of the surge barriers. The fish tended to occupy deeper sites in proximity to complex structure with the distribution also influenced by changes in salinity during the spawning period. A strong seasonal trend existed in the daily distance travelled by the fish and this was positively associated with the annual flow period. The majority of fish that successfully passed upstream through one of the surge barriers did so through a fishgate that operated outside of the spawning period. All those fish were then likely trapped with no downstream fish passage occurring in summer and autumn at a time when water quality was characterised by low dissolved oxygen and cyanobacterial blooms. The surge barrier therefore acts as a seasonal trap and increases the risk of mass mortalities. Given a projected increased need to combat flooding and storm surges associated with climate change in low-lying coastal areas, the study highlights the necessity of ensuring that the life-cycles and movement requirements of estuarine fishes are considered in the design and operation of coastal flood mitigation structures.

AB Peatlands, in their pristine state, are important long-term sinks of carbon. The extraction of peat for horticultural purposes or for biofuel however, may lead to a shift in the carbon dynamics. Additionally, the change in environmental conditions after extraction could allow for invasive species to establish and spread across the peatland. While the benefits and advantages of various restoration management practices have been identified, there has been less attention paid to the carbon exchange from unrestored peatlands at the ecosystem level. This study analyzed the carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from a post-extraction, unrestored peatland in Eastern Quebec at both the plant community level, using chamber methods, and at the ecosystem level, using eddy covariance techniques for two successive years. Methane flux at the plant community level was also measured. The site is an overall source of CO2, releasing a cumulative annual total of 173 and 259 g C m(-2) for 2014 and 2015, respectively and a small source of methane, releasing an average annual cumulative total of 1 g C m(-2). Results from this study will help managers assess the importance of post-extraction peatland restoration, by comparing the differences in CO2 exchange between restored and unrestored peatlands.

AB The effectiveness of instream restoration measures in improving habitats has been extensively examined; however, the evidence is inadequate to infer that these measures have positive effects on benthic macroinvertebrates. In this study, we compared the effects of the instream wetland (IW), groin (GR), artificial drop (AD) and boulder placement (BP) measures on the physical habitat and benthic macroinvertebrates. On a five-year scale (two to six years after the implementation of the restoration project), the sample sites treated with the four restoration measures and the unrestored upstream control sample site were compared. The results show that the instream restoration measures had significant positive effects on the physical habitat and benthic macroinvertebrates in the agricultural headwater stream, that the physical habitat quality was a key factor affecting the restoration of the benthic macroinvertebrates, and that the restorative effects were affected by the interaction between the restoration measure and time. The five-year observation period showed continuous improvement in the habitat quality as well as a continuous increase in the taxon richness and diversity of the benthic macroinvertebrates at the restored sample sites. The AD and BP measures had the most significant positive effects on the richness and diversity of the benthic macroinvertebrates. The density of the benthic macroinvertebrates in the habitat at the sample site treated with the IW continuously remained at a high level. The benthic macroinvertebrates in the habitat at the sample site treated with the GR exhibited outstanding durability against and resilience to a flood. Schemes involving densely placed instream restoration measures had continuous positive effects on the physical habitat and benthic macroinvertebrates in agricultural headwater streams on a medium time scale (six years).

AB Constructed wetlands have become a widespread mean to reduce nutrient loading from file drained agricultural areas. As a supplement to emergent plants usually present in these wetlands, submerged plants may, if present, enhance nutrient retention by occupying the deeper zones of the wetland basins. The nutrient retention efficiency may, however, vary among submerged species and also vary between mull-species communities compared to single-species communities. In this study we performed a mesocosm experiment to quantify the inorganic nitrogen (NH4-N and NO3-N) and phosphorus (PO4-P) uptake kinetic parameters (V-max and C-min) in constructed wetlands (1) in habitats with and without plants; and (2) in mull-species communities and single-species communities using four submerged plant species relevant for use in these wetlands. We found that uptake rates of PO4-P and NH4-N was three and five times higher, respectively, in habitats with plants compared to habitats without plants, whereas the uptake rates of NO3-N was similar. Mull-species communities were not more efficient in nutrient retention than single-species communities, although a residual analysis indicated that mull-species communities might be better in taking up and depleting NH4-N but not PO4-P and NO3-N. Overall, our study shows that submerged plants in deeper waters of drainage wetlands can be an important nutrient retaining component, and that a high biomass of one efficient plant species (e.g. R. aquatilis) is working similarly well as mull-species communities in this context.

AB The technique of C-13 natural abundance provides new information that can be applied to study carbon (C) incorporation into soil aggregates and to improve our understanding of the aggregate hierarchy theory. The organic matter (OM) in soil undergoes microbial decomposition, which preferentially removes the lighter C-12 isotope, enriching the remaining soil in the heavier C-13 isotope. We hypothesized that the soil aggregate turnover would gradually lead to C isotope fractionation, and changes in the C-13 natural abundance are closely linked to C turnover that, in turn, is influenced by aggregates turnover. We examined how land use affects soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics in soil aggregate with the following objectives: (1) evaluate the influence of land uses (woodland, orchard, paddy and upland) on aggregate-associated C isotope compositions and the distribution of new and old SOC in the Danjiangkou Reservoir area of central China, and (2) propose an extended scheme of C transfers between the aggregate size classes. The results showed that SOC content in aggregates generally increased with increasing aggregate size but the delta C-13 values of aggregates decreased. The SOC contents in bulk soil decreased in the order of paddy > woodland > upland > orchard. The most negative delta C-13 values in bulk soil and aggregates were observed in the paddy and woodland soils, whereas maximum delta C-13 values were obtained in the orchard and upland soils. The stable C isotope results suggest that SOC sequestration of fresh OM generally starts in macro-aggregates (> 0.25 mm), and, after disaggregation processes and microbiological consumption, the resulting degraded OM is sequestered in micro-aggregates (< 0.25 mm). This general trend is consistent with the concept of SOM stabilization by association with aggregate hierarchy theory. We conclude that different land uses and management practices significantly affect C incorporation in the aggregate system and C transfer in soil aggregates was considerably greater in the orchard and upland soils than in the woodland and paddy soils. These findings help improve the theory of soil aggregates.

AB Agriculture is a major contributor of nutrients to surface waters in large parts of the world and affects hydro-morphological conditions of rivers eventually altering their ecological status. Increasing attention has been given to those aspects of river functioning which refer to the processes able to modulate the concentration of nutrients exported downstream. This study aimed to evaluate the nutrient retention in agricultural groundwater-fed lowland streams, also known as "fontanili", contaminated by elevated nitrate loadings. We used the nutrient spiraling method to assess ammonium (NH4) and phosphate (PO4) retention in two fontanili reaches, that significantly differed in presence/absence of aquatic macrophytes and tree canopy in the riparian zone. The results indicate that the overall nutrient retention was higher in the macrophyte-rich than in the unvegetated stream channel. The metric better reflecting the biological removal (i.e. the uptake velocity-V-f) was 9.8-fold and 4.4-fold higher, respectively for NH4 and PO4, in the vegetated than in the unvegetated reach. Temperature was an important driver of nutrient retention in vegetated condition, while discharge explained most variation of the uptake length of both nutrients in the reach where macrophytes were lacking. The role of the autotrophic compartment was further highlighted by the positive association between the uptake velocity (V-f-NH4 and V-f-PO4) and the gross primary production. The relationships observed between some retention metrics and the relative nutrient availability suggest that primary producers strongly controlled NH4 retention despite the extremely high N:P water ratio. The median NH4 uptake rate at the macrophyte-rich spring (30.5 mu g m(-2) min(-1)) was 5.5 fold higher than that at the unvegetated one, and was in the range reported for pristine streams. A few simple management actions are suggested that might be helpful to mitigate nitrogen and phosphorous pollution in the hydraulic networks of the Po Plain.

AB We attempted to assess the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) rates estimated by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in an arid region by comparing other regional-based ETa estimates: the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) products, the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Global Evapotranspiration product (MOD16), and the Generalized Complementary Relationship (GCR) model. The results by the SWAT model clearly showed that ETa rates in the SWAT model are limited by soil water availability. From the comparison of the annual ETa estimates, the GCR model among those ETa estimation methods simulated slightly higher values than the water-balance derived ETa rates (i.e., the difference between annual precipitation and annual stream flow rates). The annual ETa rates of the SSEBop products showed the closest slope of the regression line to 1.0, while the highest R-2 (coefficient of determination) value was found from the annual ETa estimates by the SWAT model. The monthly ETa by the GCR model had the highest linear relationship with those of the SSEBop products. However, the SWAT model did not have a strong linear relationship with the monthly ETa of the SSEBop products unlike the comparison against the MOD16 products. This study recommends a further study on more reliable ETa estimates in arid or semi-arid regions by the SWAT model.

AB Latent variables (i.e., normally distributed random noise) provide valuable information regarding model input uncertainty. Watershed processes have been explored with sophisticated simulation models in the past few decades and researchers have found that incorporating the uncertainty attributed to forcing inputs, model parameters, and measured data, can help improve simulation results, however, not in all cases. Latent variable use requires careful consideration to determine if results are better or worse. In this study, latent variables were implemented to both precipitation and air temperature data to investigate the influence on model predictions and associated predictive uncertainty by using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Results indicated that model predictions in terms of statistics, behavior solutions, and predictive uncertainty were substantially affected by applying latent variables on precipitation data but it does not guarantee improved performance. On the other hand, model responses did not denote similar performance by conducting the same approach to air temperature data. Ultimately, incorporating latent variables a priori proportionally may or may not improve model predictive uncertainty. Researchers should carefully consider latent variable potential benefits on model predictions before committing to further work or making important model-supported decisions.

AB Water infiltration is a basic parameter to understand the hydrological response of semi-arid or arid soils - where runoff generation is dominated by infiltration-excess - subjected to wildfire. To evaluate the hydrological effects of straw application on a sandy loam soil after wildfire, the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, water content and temperature of mulched and nonmulched (considered as control) soils were monitored throughout eight months. Compared to untreated soils, straw maintained higher temperatures and water contents in mulched plots, but reduced their unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, particularly in the drier season. These results suggest that straw release may lead to a decrease of water infiltration capacity of soils subjected to wildfire, with particular evidence in summer in the case of heavy storm occurrence.

AB A dam will be built in the upper reaches of the Mekong River, obstructing fish migration and gene exchange, and a fish lift will be constructed to mitigate these impacts. Target species for the lift were selected based on five criteria: (1) passage demand, (2) passage utility, (3, 4) protection worthiness (protection class and economic value) and (5) fish resource status. Swimming performance of target fish species were assessed and the results were used to recommend velocity criteria for the lift. Swimming performance was assessed by measuring induced flow velocity (U-ind, the lowest water velocity that induces continuous fish motion against the flow), critical swimming speed (U-crit) and burst speed (U-burst). The relationship of swimming performance to body length was also investigated. The research led to three primary findings: (1) The absolute U-ind and U-crit (m/s) were positively correlated with body length, whereas the relationship between the absolute U-burst (m/s) and body length were inconsistent. (2) The flow that was 90% effective in reaching the desired endpoint (EF90) was used to set fish lift design criteria for flow velocity. The EF90 value for U-ind (90% induction rate) was 0.17 m/s and the values for U-crit and U-burst (90% success rates), were 0.62 m/s and 0.87 m/s. (3) Recommended velocity criteria for the fish lift are as follows: entrance velocity, 0.37-0.87 m/s (0.6 Ucrit-EF90-Uburst-EF90), with mean velocity 0.50 m/s (0.8 Ucrit-EF90); passageway velocity, 0.17-0.50 m/s (Uind-EF90-0.8 Ucrit-EF90), with mean velocity 0.37 m/s (0.6 Ucrit-EF90); holding chamber velocity, 0.17-0.37 m/s (Uind-EF90-0.6 Ucrit-EF90), with mean velocity 0.27 m/s [(Uind-EF90 + 0.6 Ucrit-EF 90)/2]. The approach developed in this case study has good potential as a general method for selecting target fish species and setting site-specific flow velocity criteria for fish passage design.

AB Oyster reefs are important foundational habitats and provide many ecosystem services. A century of habitat degradation has resulted in substantial reductions in the extent and quality of oyster reefs in many estuaries, thus spurring restoration efforts. In this study, a 1.5 ha oyster reef complex was constructed in Copano Bay, Texas to restore habitat for oysters and associated fauna. Oysters and resident and transient fishes and crustaceans were monitored at the restored reef as well as at nearby natural oyster reef and unrestored bottom (i.e., dense mud with shell hash) habitats for two years following reef construction. The restored reef had substantial oyster recruitment and growth, with oyster abundance and size comparable to nearby habitats within the first year. Resident and transient fauna communities recruited to the restored reef within six months post-construction, and abundance and diversity were comparable to nearby habitats. Significant changes observed in oyster densities between the first and second year post-restoration demonstrate the importance of monitoring over multiple years to capture multiple recruitment cycles and growth to market size. Nekton densities did not change significantly after the first year, but changes in community assemblages were observed through the end of the study. The high densities of oysters and resident nekton relative to other studies indicate that this restoration project was successful in restoring suitable habitat. The design of the reef complex, consisting of relatively high-relief reef mounds and deeper corridors, likely contributed to the relatively high oyster and nekton densities observed in this study. Overall, the restored reef in this study showed tremendous near-term success in providing important ecological functions associated with habitat provision and oyster production.

ID PERFORMANCE; INFRASTRUCTURE; RUNOFF; STORMWATER; MANAGEMENT
AB This paper evaluates the potential of living green facades in intercepting precipitation and delaying 'canopy through-flow' (i.e. total precipitation minus canopy interception). Precipitation interception and delayed through-flow (i.e. discharge) from two visually distinct mixed-species green facade configurations - one, fully-foliated and the other twiggy (respectively as proxies for well-managed and degenerated stands) - were monitored using rain gauges located at their base. The precipitation interception levels for the fully-foliated and the twiggy stands respectively ranged between 54 and 94% and 10-55% of the total precipitation. Regression of the experimental data showed interception volumes were proportional to the ambient precipitation up to a maximum tested event size of 35 mm. The fully-foliated facade gave a delay of at least 30 min from the start of precipitation events to the first measured through-flow, compared to about 15 min for the twiggy facade. This highlights the potential for well-foliated and maintained facades to contribute to reducing peak flows within urban drainage infrastructure, and the importance of facade maintenance in ensuring good interception and delay properties.

AB Treatment wetland technologies for wastewater treatment can be easily applied for removal of all pollutants except phosphorous. They are applicable in a small towns and rural areas, places where conventional wastewater treatment plant cannot properly operate because of common economic constraints. In Poland only the 8% of rural areas are equipped with sewer system, thus treatment wetlands might be an alternative, effective and low-cost method to treat wastewater from households. The aim of this study was to optimise the operational parameters for Phoslock (R) application on treated wastewater and to prove that Phoslock (R) may also be successfully used to remove phosphorus compounds from treated wastewater and possibly recover them. Phoslock (R) also known as lanthanum-modified bentonite (LMB) is an adsorbent material developed by the Land and Water Division of Australia's CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization). Experimental trials were carried out in the laboratory with batch reactors pilot units in three separate stages to establish sorption capacity of material, define characteristic constants of isotherms of adsorption and verify kinetic parameters by using pseudo-second order model. Carried out research confirmed high sorption capacity of LMB Phoslock (R) for removal of phosphorous compounds from wastewater both synthetic and effluent from treatment wetland. Performed kinetic studies have shown that LMB is much less effective in case of real effluent from WWTP (2.09 mg/g) than in synthetic wastewater (4.31 mg/g). Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models have shown relatively good matching of isotherms in graphical. Results obtained for kinetic studies have shown correlation coefficient close to 1.0 both for synthetic and effluent from WWTP. Application of LMB caused not only a rapid decrease of PO43--P concentration, but also no other meaningful influence on the water solution was discovered.

AB Acid mine drainage (AMD) treatment processes were investigated for removal of anions including bromide, fluoride, chloride, nitrate, phosphate, and sulfate. The study selected a passive process consisting of an aerated lagoon and aerobic wetlands and an active process composed of a lime dosing silo and a sedimentation pond. The results showed both processes were capable of removing fluoride, nitrate, and phosphate. The passive process removed 21% bromide and 26% chloride as a result of biotic mechanisms which could not be achieved by the active process. Additionally, higher temperature and longer hydraulic retention time promoted the removal of many anions. With abiotic mechanisms such as precipitation, the active process was capable of removing sulfate, which was found unsuccessful by the passive process due to unfavorable conditions for the growth of sulfate reducing bacteria. Although the anions in the AMD waters were not high enough to generate substantial environmental and health concerns, their removals, especially the removals of bromide, phosphate and sulfate, would reduce burdens at downstream drinking water treatment plants.

AB Various newly discovered novel biological nitrogen removal (BNR) routes via nitrite offer great potential for improving nitrogen removal efficiency of constructed wetlands. In these novel routes, nitrite is required as the substrate or intermediary media. Hence, in the present study, the tolerance and physiological responses of sweet flag (Acorus calamus L.) to nitrite stress were investigated. Results showed that the physiology of sweet flag was not significantly affected when exposed to nitrite up to 20 mg/L. High nitrite levels (>= 30 mg/L) led to changes in its cell membrane permeability, plant photosynthesis and activities of antioxidant enzymes. Particularly, when exposed to a nitrite level of 40 mg/L, sweet flag displayed trends of significant increase in the percentage of electrolyte leakage and contents of malondialdehyde and proline, whereas the chlorophyll content and plant height decreased and antioxidant defence systems were disrupted. Therefore, for CWs with sweet flag, 30 mg/L is the recommended threshold value for nitrite.

AB Eryngium viviparum is a very rare species with a fragmented distribution between the NW of the Iberian peninsula and Brittany. In France, the species is only maintained in one locality, thanks to management efforts. The plant is currently included in a National Action Plan that encompasses reintroductions into restored and ecologically favorable historic locations.
   In 2015, an experimental reintroduction study had been implemented in order to define the optimal establishment method in relation to site ecological factors. The period of implantation, the demographic stage of introduced individuals and local conditions, including microtopography, were tested. Population dynamic was evaluated during the two first years, through the observation of survival rates and the establishment of a new generation.
   The introduced seeds showed very low germination rates for both sites whereas contrasted results were obtained with adult transplantations. Survival rates appeared to be influenced by the microtopography but not by the season of transplantation. The establishment of a new generation has been observed, leading to the increase of the population size on both sites. The results of this experiment demonstrate that the reestablishment of Eryngium viviparum' populations in restored sites may encourage the reintroduction of the species on a larger scale.

AB When engineers and ecologists face a fishway design, many issues need to be considered, the type of fishway being the first and foremost. It is an especially complex issue in areas with species whose migratory and swimming behavior are as yet poorly known as Mediterranean barbels. The present study focuses on the fish passage of two of the most common types of technical fishways: Vertical Slot (VS), and Submerged Notch with Bottom Orifice (SNBO). Both types were studied and compared in terms of ascent ability (as the success rate and transit time) and motivation (as the proportion of attempts and attempt rate), with Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus bocagei) as the target species.
   Ascent ability in VS and SNBO were similar. More than 90% of fish ascended the fishways successfully and the median transit time to ascend a total water height of 2.25 m was less than 23 min. Fish length had an effect on ascent time, with the biggest ones being faster. Motivation was greater for VS, although not seeming to have a relevant influence in the passage.
   These results support the use of VS and SNBO in areas with Iberian barbel and provide new data of fishways performance helping ecologists and engineers with their decision making, mainly in Mediterranean areas with similar habitats and species.

ID DOMESTIC WASTE-WATER; CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; GREYWATER; PLANTS
AB A prototype artificial wetland was designed to treat greywaters from the community of El Carrizo in Durango, Mexico, to remove the surfactants derived from used detergents. For this study, 6 '' PVC tubes with a water depth of 40 cm were used, in which the water was replaced after 3, 8 and 15 days. Tezontle, gravel and agave fibre were used as supports, and Schoenoplectus americanus, which is an emergent aquatic plant, was used as biological material. The different levels of the factors resulted in 24 treatments, whose differences were validated with a factorial ANOVA of 4 x 2 x 3 with three repetitions. At the beginning and end of each period, it was determined the removal of detergents, oils and grease, total solids, total volatile solids, total suspended solids, changes in pH and electrical conductivity and toxicity of the effluent through bioassays with lettuce seeds. The results show that the best percentage removal of detergents (surfactants linear alkylbenzene sulfonates, LAS) of 90% was obtained with the agave fibre, with or without S. americanus, at a hydraulic residence time of 15 days; however, the treated water showed low seed germination indexes. This was followed by the gravel-S. americanus system, which had a removal percentage of 78% and showed decreases in all of the measured parameters and the lowest toxicity value on germination and root growth of Lactuca saliva. These characteristics define the optimal parameters for the implementation of artificial wetlands in the community of El Carrizo, Durango, Dgo., Mexico.

AB Restoring the longitudinal connectivity of rivers is becoming a conservation priority in countries with high hydroelectric plant (HEP) development. Newly designed downstream passage solutions for fish are being installed in small and medium-sized HEPs in France, and an accurate evaluation of their functionality is needed. Here we addressed the efficiency of protection systems for the downstream migration of Atlantic salmon smolts a four HEPs (three 26 degrees horizontally inclined racks and one 15 degrees oriented to the flow rack in the bank alignment, all with 20 mm spaced bars). Between 239 and 300 hatchery-reared salmon smolts were PIT-tagged and released in 5-6 groups 100 m upstream of each studied HEP. Their passages through the HEPs were detected with radio frequency identification (RFID) antenna in the bypasses for downstream migration and the fish passes for upstream migration. On average between 82.8% and 92.3% of released smolts successfully passed the HEP through one of the two non-turbine routes. Resulting mean bypass passage efficiency ranged from 80.9 to 87.5% and all fish groups reached over 70% passage efficiency. Excepting one she, 50% of smolts passed through the bypass in less than 23 min after release, and 75% of them in less than 2 h 15 min. Combining our findings with previously estimated fish entrainment rates into the intake channel and turbine-related mortality rates, we assessed the overall fish survivals a the studied dam/HEPs which are between 98.24% and near 100%. Our results confirm recommended design criteria for inclined and oriented racks and the interest of the tested devices for the protection of downstream migrating salmon smolts.

AB Since their inception in larger pond systems, the focus of anaerobic ponds has shifted from solids removal to optimising biogas production and reducing physical footprint to minimise land requirements. In this study, a horizontally baffled (HBAP) and vertically baffled (VBAP) anaerobic pond were compared. Distinct differences in the removal efficiency of COD fractions were observed, with particulate COD removal of 78% and 32%, and soluble COD removal of -26% and 19% in the HBAP and VBAP, respectively. A staged pond (SAP) was constructed through an HBAP placed upstream of a VBAP, with an additional HBAP used as a control (CAP). The SAP demonstrated superior biogas recovery potential over the control: methane production by the conclusion of the study was 6.09 and 9.04 LCH4 m(-3) wastewater treated for the CAP and SAP, respectively. Methanogenic activity in the ponds was higher closer to the outlet, and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis dominated over acetoclastic pathways.

AB Adequately designed fishways mitigate the negative effects of barriers in rivers, restoring longitudinal connectivity. To do so, they must present suitable hydraulic conditions, with velocity and turbulence fields adequate for multiple fish species. In the present study, numerical modelling was used to compare the hydrodynamics of two widely used vertical slot fishways (VSF) configurations and three multi slot fishway (MSF) configurations. The MSF configuration needs a lower discharge to operate than the VSF, while keeping similar flow depths, which is vital in regions where water availability is limited, such as most Mediterranean regions. By reducing the discharge, the velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, and Reynolds shear stress values in the studied MSF configurations are much lower than the values for VSF configurations. Thus, besides requiring smaller discharges than similar VSF geometries, the MSF additionally could be less selective for fish species, particularly smaller-sized individuals, and individuals with weaker swimming capacities, and a better option for a multiple-species fishway.

Batch scale studies for the biosorption potential of novel biosorbent Phragmites australis (Reeds). The study was supported at different constraints to obtain prime conditions of biosorbent dose, time of contact, pH, agitation speed and initial organic loads concentration. To dissect the propriety of the procedure and decided amount of organic loads removal, Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were connected. The ideal estimations of contact time and agitation speed were found at 120 min and 150 rpm respectively. The ideal biosorption limits were seen at pH 7. Both pseudo-first and pseudo-second order models were connected and it was discovered that information fitting best to the pseudo-second-arrange active model. The outcomes demonstrated that Phragmites australis was an empowering adsorbent for the biosorption treatment of oily derivatives industrial wastewater.

AB Best management practices (BMPs) for forestry activities have been developed to mitigate the impacts of timber harvesting on stream ecosystems in New South Wales, Australia. These BMPs include selective harvesting within the catchment, exclusion of harvesting in riparian zones, and restrictions on harvesting and machinery operations during wet weather or on steep slopes. The few studies assessing the ecological effects of forestry BMPs have largely focussed on operations in temperate climates and are often based on a single pair of control and impact streams. But what are the effects in subtropical regions where climatic and hydrological variability may be greater? Are the effects of selective harvesting dependent on the proximity of harvesting to the locations of monitoring? We used a multiple paired-catchment study to assess effects of forestry BMPs on standing stocks of benthic coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) and densities of invertebrate detritivores in streams draining subtropical eucalypt catchments that were either harvested using BMPs ('impact') or unharvested ('control'). CPOM and detritivores in three pools in each of the four streams were sampled multiple times before and after the impact catchments were harvested. Harvesting intensity and proximity of harvesting to stream monitoring sites differed between 'impact' catchments. Benthic CPOM was dominated by leaves and leaf fragments in all streams. There were no post-harvesting differences in CPOM composition, standing stocks of different CPOM fractions or densities of detritivorous stream invertebrates in two feeding groups (collector-gatherers and shredders) between stream pairs despite differences in the proximity (minimum of similar to 50 m and 1.6 km) of harvesting to monitoring sites. We conclude that relative to matched control sites, selective forestry BMPs do not alter CPOM stocks and stream detritivore densities in this subtropical Australian eucalypt forest, implying that these BMPs are effective in mitigating effects of harvesting across similar subtropical forests.

To try to address this, various culvert remediation designs have been implemented, including the installation of vertical baffles and the provision of naturalistic (rock) substrates. While remediation strategies generally aim to reduce the velocity of water flowing through the structure, there is often resistance to their use because the resultant reduction in culvert discharge can negatively impact upstream flooding while also resulting in debris clogging and increased culvert maintenance costs. In addition, baffles markedly increase water turbulence that may be detrimental to passage by some fish species or size classes. Here we present some novel remediation designs that exploit the reduced water velocity in boundary layers along the culvert wall to enhance fish passage without significantly compromising discharge capacity. These longitudinal designs produce an expanded reduced velocity zone along the culvert margins that generate minimal turbulence. We show that these novel designs are significantly advantageous to the swimming endurance and traversability for six small-bodied Australian fish species. We also provide data on how and why some culvert baffle designs may impede small-bodied fish passage. This data scales with increasing water velocity, encompassing inter-specific differences in swimming capacity. These results have broad implications for the movement of small-bodied fish species, and the successful recruitment of large-bodied commercially important species, where baffles have been implemented.

AB The separate and combined effects of climate change and forest clearcutting on discharge, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and particulate organic carbon (POC) load at a seasonal and annual scale were evaluated for the Oka catchment.
   Compared to the baseline scenario (1970-2000), climate change displayed a decrease in annual rainfall (RCP4.5: 27% and RCP8.5: 28%) and an increase in mean temperature (12% for both emission scenarios). Together with the decrease in rainfall, a decrease in discharge and, consequently, in SPM and POC load was also displayed. In RCP4.5, annual discharge, SPM and POC load decreased by 16%, 68% and 38%, respectively. A slightly larger decrease was found in RCP8.5: 21% for discharge, 70% for SPM load and 41% for POC load. Evapotranspiration (ET) increased relative to the baseline, with a change of 15% (RCP4.5) and 16% (RCP8.5).
   With regard to forest clearcut scenarios, annual discharge ranged between 3% (Scenario 1) and 15% (Scenario 3). At the same time, ET decreased by between 2% (Scenario 1) and 13% (Scenario 3) relative to the baseline (2001-2012). The model predicted a rise in SPM load of between 19% (Scenario 1) and 106% (Scenario 3). The predicted annual POC load ranged between 9% (Scenario 1) and 47% (Scenario 3).
   The combination of climate change and forest clearcutting scenarios showed a reduction in discharge, SPM and POC load compared to the baseline. Discharge, SPM and POC load decrease ranged between 2-18%, 30-63% and 12-36% in scenarios 8 and 7, respectively.

AB In our theoretical investigation for small Ag-Au alloy clusters, we found that pronounced polarization of their electrostatic charge occurs with some generic regularities. We propose a set of "rules" for the charge distribution, which may be extended to larger Ag-Au alloy clusters or even bulk solids: (1) atoms in lower-coordinated sites tend to be charged more negatively or less positively; (2) the charge of Au is affected by nearest neighbor atoms only, contrary to the case of Ag. The origins of these phenomenological rules may include site-dependent electronic polarization and the difference in s/p hybridization between Ag and Au.

AB Hard spheres mixed with penetrable hard spheres display an isostructural solid-solid transition. This phase transition is fully driven by the entropy gain of the depletants without invoking explicit pair potentials between the colloidal particles. The solid-solid phase coexistence terminates at a critical endpoint with a size ratio q approximate to 0.09. Colloid-polymer mixtures are an excellent candidate for the experimental realization of this intricate solid-solid transition, first predicted by Bolhuis and Frenkel for hard spheres with short range pair attractions

AB First principle calculations are performed to study the charge transfer and recombination dynamics at the interface of dye-(ZnO)(n) hollow quantum dot (QD). It has been revealed that the extent of dye-ZnO interaction depends on the size of the QD which severely affects the driving force for charge transfer and recombination. The deep level conduction band of a particular sized-QD, (ZnO)(36) effectively couples with the donor orbital of dye resulting faster charge injection and slower recombination which demonstrates that the size of the QD is pivotal for determining the performance of such devices.

AB Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent (TD-DFT) computations have been carried out to study the nonlinear optical response of C24S12 and C16S8 sulflowers with lithium atom. The Li interaction surprisingly causes the remarkable first hyperpolarizability enhancement. Also, the HOMO-LUMO gaps of C24S12 and C16S8 sulflowers are significantly narrowed due to the interaction. The Li interaction with these sulflowers is found to be thermodynamically favorable with negative interaction energies. These sulflowers interacted with Li atom could be introduced as innovative nonlinear optical nanomaterial.

AB In this study, chemical de-alloying method was used to prepare nanoporous gold (NPG) from the Au containing amorphous alloy, with chemical composition of Au20Cu48Ag7Pd5Si20. Gold nanostructures were electrodeposited on the nanoporous gold by adjusting the applied potentials and deposition times. Using Rhodamine 6G (R6G) as probe molecule, the surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity of various Au nanostructures on nanoporous gold were compared. The dendritic nanostructures electrodeposited for 3000 s on NPG exhibited strongest SERS effect and high reproducibility. Using this best SERS active substrate for melamine sensing, the detection limit of 10(-7) M was achieved.

AB In this study, the size effects of graphene oxide (GO) sheets on the phase change behaviors of crosslinking polyurethane system have been investigated. The experimental results show that phase change performance of the system is connected closely to the heterogeneous nucleation, physical confinements from GO and interactions in the system, which are inseparable from the specific surface area and the contents of oxygen functional groups depending on the size. This work has a theoretical significance to design thermal energy storage materials with desired properties.

AB First-principles calculations were carried out to predict the electronic and optical properties of PtS2 monolayer. We interpreted that the band gaps of monolayer (ML) PtS2 can be tuned continuously via strain engineering. In this thesis, both tensile and shear strains were investigated. It was testified that mechanical strains reduce the band gap of ML PtS2 causing an indirect-to-direct band gap transition. These transitions, in turn, significantly depend on the type of applied strain. The optical properties were calculated and a clear red shift was observed with the increasing strain.

AB The quantum chemical study of phenols cytotoxicity extended to their metabolites is presented. Based on O-H bond dissociation enthalpies (BDE) and octanol-water partition coefficients (Log P) calculated using density functional theory (M06-2X and B3LYP functionals) with 6-311++ G(d, p) basis set, their toxicity, in terms of Log (1/C), is described. The characterization of quinoid metabolites is also performed. Observed toxicity of phenols can be correlated with the properties of their ortho-quinone oxidation products/metabolites, i.e. Log P and partial atomic charges at C2 or O2 atoms, too. Found results indicate that ortho-quinones contribute to the overall experimentally determined toxicity of phenols.

AB Ion selectivity by cylindrical pores has been investigated using the primitive model of electrolytes and the classical density functional theory. It is found that a neutral pore always exhibits the preferential adsorption of large ions, regardless of the pore size and the bulk electrolyte composition. For a charged nanopore, however, the pore selectivity depends not only on the ion size but also on the pore radius as well as the surface electrical potential. While a nanopore prefers adsorption of small counterions when its radius is sufficiently large, it can be large-ion selective when its size becomes comparable to the ion diameters.

AB Extracellular sulfatases, sulfatase 1 (Sulf1) and sulfatase 2 (Sulf2), play a pivotal role in cell signaling and carcinogenesis. Chemokine CCL5 inhibits Ang II-induced hypertensive mediators via angiotensin II (Ang II) type 2 receptor (AT(2) R) pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In this study, we investigated the effect of Sulfs on anti-hypertensive effects of CCL5 in SHR VSMCs. CCL5 attenuated Ang II-induced inhibition of sulfatase activity in SHR VSMCs. Inhibition of Ang II-induced 12-lipoxygenase (12-LO) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression by CCL5 was reduced in Sulf1 small interfering RNA (siRNA)-transfected SHR VSMCs. In addition, attenuation of Ang II-induced dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH-1) inhibition by CCL5 was reduced in Sulf1 siRNA-transfected SHR VSMCs. Downregulation of Sulf2 did not affect inhibitory effects of CCL5 on Ang II-induced 12-LO and ET-1 expression and Ang II induced inhibition of DDAH-1 expression in SHR VSMCs. Downregulation of Sulf1 abrogated the expression of CCL5-induced AT(2) R messenger RNA (mRNA) and synergistic effect of CCL5 on Ang II-induced AT(2) R expression in SHR VSMCs. These findings suggest that Sulf1 is a potential up-regulatory factor in anti-hypertensive actions of CCL5 via AT(2) R pathway on Ang II-induced hypertensive effects in SHR VSMCs.

AB Background: Interleukin (IL)-17A is proinflammatory cytokine produced by Th17 cells, which play key, but sometimes inconsistent role in autoimmunity and cancer. Polymorphic variants in IL-17A gene were differentially associated with susceptibility to cancer, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Aim We investigated the association between six IL-17A gene variants (rs3819024, rs2275913, rs3819025, rs10484879, rs7747909, and rs3748067) with CRC susceptibility in Tunisians.
   Subjects and Methods: Retrospective case-control study. Study subjects comprised 293 patients with CRC, and 268 age-, gender-, and BMI-matched healthy controls. IL-17A genotyping was done by real-time PCR, with defined clusters.
   Results: Of the seven tested IL-17A tag-SNPs, minor allele frequency (MAF) of rs10484879 was significantly higher in CRC patients than control subjects. Heterozygous rs10484879 [OR (95% CI) = 2.63 (1.64-4.21)] was associated with higher risk, while carriage of heterozygous rs3748067 genotype was associated with reduced risk of CRC [OR (95% CI) = 0.56 (0.37-0.84)], respectively. Carriage of rs10484879 minor allele correlated with positive family history of CRC and other cancers (P = 0.002), CRC staging (P = 0.044), CRC treatment (P = 0.038), and with chemo body reaction (P = 0.001). Of the 7 IL-17A variants, 4 were in linkage disequilibrium, hence allowing for construction of 4-locus haplotypes. Varied linkage disequilibrium (LD) was noted between the even tested IL-17A variants, and further analysis was limited to only 4-locus (rs3819024-rs2275913-rs10484879-rs7747909). Haploview analysis identified the 4-locus IL-17A haplotypes AGTG (P < 0.011), and GATG (P = 0.036) to be positively associated with CRC, after controlling key covariates.
   Conclusion: IL-17A rs10484879 SNP, and IL-17A haplotypes AGGTG and GAGTG constitute independent factors of CRC susceptibility. We propose that IL-17A may be a target for future CRC immunotherapy.

AB Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a viral encephalitis disease caused by infection with the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). The virus can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause death or long-term sequela in infected humans or animals. In this study, we first investigated the distribution of JEV infection in brain and further analyzed the dynamic change in inflammation related genes, chemokines, as well as pathological characteristics. Results demonstrated that CCR2 and CCR5 antagonist could significantly inhibit the inflammation. The mice treated with CCR2 and CCR5 antagonists had a higher survival rate between 60% and 70%, respectively. In summary, our study thoroughly illustrated the characteristics of the dynamic change in inflammation related genes and chemokines induced by JEV infection. We further indicated that CCR5 and CCR2 are potential targets for treatment of JE.

AB Background: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin from the outer membrane of Gram negative bacteria has been reported to cause neuroinflammation and learning and memory deficits. There are reports describing the beneficial effects of Imperatorin (IMP), a naturally occurring furanocoumarin in central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as anxiety and epilepsy.
   Objective: In the current study, we investigated whether IMP protects against LPS mediated memory deficits and neuroinflammation.
   Methods: Mice pretreated with IMP (5, 10 mg/kg po) were administered LPS (250 mu g/kg ip) for 7 days. Memory was evaluated in the Morris water maze (MWM) and Y maze. The mice were euthanised and different biochemical assessments were carried out to measure oxidative stress and acetyl choline esterase (AChE). Further, evaluation of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in hippocampus and cortex of brain were performed.
   Results: LPS administration caused poor memory retention in both, MWM and Y maze, and caused distinct oxidative stress since decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and increased lipid peroxidation were observed. Also, a significant rise was observed in the levels of AChE. Moreover, a rise in TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels and depleted levels of BDNF were noted. IMP pretreatment reversed LPS induced behavioral and memory disturbances and significantly decreased the oxidative stress and AChE levels. It also reduced TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels and caused a significant upregulation of BDNF levels.
   Conclusion: Present study highlights the potential neuroprotective role of IMP against LPS mediated cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation.

AB Adiponectin is considered an adipokine that has essential anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitivity actions. The adaptor protein containing the pleckstrin homology domain, the phosphotyrosine-binding domain, and leucine zipper motif 1 (APPL1) is a protein involved in adiponectin signaling that plays a role in many physiological and pathophysiological processes. In the central nervous system, adiponectin can potentiate the effects of leptin in the arcuate proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons. However, the role of APPL1 in the hypothalamus is not well understood. Therefore, in this study, we explored the effects of acute physical exercise on APPL1 protein content in the hypothalamus and food intake control in leptin stimulated-obese mice. Here we show that acute exercise increased serum adiponectin levels and APPL1 content in the hypothalamus, which were followed by reduced food intake in obese mice. Further, at the molecular level, the exercised obese mice increased the protein kinase B (Akt) signaling in the hypothalamus and attenuated the mammalian homolog of Drosophila tribbles protein 3 (TRB3) levels. In conclusion, the results indicate physical exercise is capable of increasing APPL1 protein content in the hypothalamus of leptin stimulated-obese mice and modulating food intake.

AB Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a chronic syndrome that affects the urinary bladder. The etiology of this disease is unclear, and no effective therapies are available at this time. Although inflammation is suspected, no clear evidence for a role of conventional mediators of inflammation, such as cytokines and their downstream molecules, has been obtained to date. Our previous studies indicated that primary cell cultures derived from IC urothelium abnormally express molecules associated with cell adhesion. Here we describe a mechanism by which transcriptional changes in tight junction and adhesion molecules are mediated. Oncosuppressor proteins p53 and cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor p21 directly associate with regulatory sites on the ZO-1 and E-cadherin genes, identifying important roles for p53 and p21 in driving non-oncogenic pathologies. These data also suggest that interference with these factors offers a potential therapeutic opportunity.

AB Background: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are considered as a pro inflammatory and interleukin-10 (IL 10) anti inflammatory have been shown to predict the risk of incident of coronary artery disease (CAD). The polymorphism at promoter of TNF-alpha and IL-10 has been shown to increase transcriptional activity of the gene and play a important role in patho physiology of CAD. Aim of present study is to examine the impact of the TNF-alpha and IL-10 variant allele on various markers of the CAD and to study its relation with circulating TNF-alpha and IL-10 levels.
   Methods: The 308 G/A & - 238 G/A of TNF-alpha and -1082 G/A & -819 C/T of IL-10 gene polymorphism has been studied in 301 diagnosed CAD subjects (Age 51.50 +/- 9.28; BMI 25.30 +/- 3.58) and 305 healthy controls (Age 51.57 +/- 9.50; BMI 24.06 +/- 7.26). These polymorphism of TNF-alpha and IL-10 were detected by real time PCR by using Taqman SNP genotyping assay. Furthermore serum TNF-alpha and IL-10 levels were also measured by ELISA.
   Results: Allelic and genotypic frequencies did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the controls (p > 0.05). On allele contrast, significant association with susceptibility to CAD was detected with polymorphisms in TNF-alpha-308 G/A, that variant genotype GA + AA (dominant model) (p = 0.030: OR = 1.61: 95% CI = 1.06-2.44) and variant allele (A) (p = 0.006: OR = 1.71: 95% CI = 1.17-2.51) of TNF-alpha 308 G/A gene was significant highly observed in the cases as compared to control group. Furthermore, variant genotype CT + TT (dominant model) (p = 0.004: OR = 1.62: 95% CI = 1.17-2.24) and variant allele (T) (p < 0.001: OR = 1.49: 95% CI = 1.17-1.89) of IL-10 819 C/T gene was significant highly observed in the cases as compared to control group.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that the TNF-alpha G-308A polymorphism independently associated with DBP, cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL, TNF-alpha and IL-10 levels which may be leads to the development of coronary artery disease of North Indians.

AB Obesity is a serious and growing world healthy problem affecting developed and developing countries. The new conception of obesity as a basal inflammatory condition has opened a new window of possibilities to identify inflammatory biomarkers to be used in the diagnosis or prognosis of obesity-associated comorbidities. This present work aims the identification of the adipokines (leptin and resistin), chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL16) and the BMP-2 and their association with the clinical, biochemical (fasting glucose, hemogram, cholesterol, T3, T4 and TSH) and anthropometric (weight, height, body circumferences, skinfold thickness and percentage of body fat) parameters in young adults (18-30 years old) presenting obesity and overweight. Our data showed increasing in anthropometric parameters and in the plasma inflammatory levels in those individuals presenting overweight and obesity. We observed a higher plasma levels of CCL2, CCL5, CXCL16, leptin and resistin in those overweigh and obese individuals. In addition, the CCL2, CCL5 presented a positive correlation with the body mass index and the body fat percentage. Assuming the obesity as a systemic inflammatory process, in this current study, the overweight individuals possess a close similar pattern of circulating inflammatory mediators which might be a potential risk of the development of obesity comorbidities. Further studies are still needed to precise the role of the biomarkers CCL2, CCL5, CXCL16 and BMP-2 in the clinical prognosis related to the overweight or obese individuals.

AB Background: The nature of a link between poor oral health and obesity is not fully understood. It is also unclear if saliva contributes to it and whether the properties of saliva change as a result of an increase in body mass or rather as a consequence of obesity-associated comorbidities. This pilot study was undertaken in an attempt to determine if salivary biomarkers can identify obesity per se.
   Methods: Whole mixed saliva was analysed for 16 soluble parameters covering 4 categories (inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, adipokines). In the discovery group, 19 obese and 25 non-obese women matched for age, with similar hygiene habits, with no comorbidities and not taking any medication known to affect saliva secretion were analysed. In the validation group, a cohort of no-preselected 81 individuals (34 obese) were analysed.
   Results: Individuals with obesity had significantly higher salivary concentrations of several cytokines and adipokines, of which TNF-R1, serpin A12 and PAI-1 were identified as parameters discriminating between obese and non-obese subjects with the highest sensitivity and specificity.
   Conclusions: Obesity per se leads to distinct changes in the concentration of several parameters in saliva. These findings may have diagnostic implications for distinguishing the effects of obesity and obesity-linked co-morbidities on oral health.

AB Objectives: The goal of this study is to profile the metabolic changes in the plasma of HIV patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) relative to their treatment-na ve phase, aimed to identify precision therapy for HIV for improving prognosis and predicting dyslipidemia caused by LPV/r.
   Methods: 38 longitudinal plasma samples were collected from 19 HIV-infected patients both before and after antiretroviral therapy, and 18 samples from healthy individuals were used as controls. Untargeted metabolomics profiling of these plasma samples was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
   Results: A total of 331 compounds of known identity were detected among these metabolites, a 67-metabolite signature mainly mapping to tryptophan, histidine, acyl camitine, ketone bodies and fatty acid metabolism distinguished HIV patients from healthy controls. The levels of 19 out of the 67 altered metabolites including histidine, kynurenine, and 3-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), recovered after LPV/r-based antiretroviral therapy, and histidine was positively correlated with the presence of CD4 + T lymphocytes. Furthermore, using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, we discovered that butyrylcarnitine in combination with myristic acid from plasma in treatment-na ve patients could predict dyslipidemia caused by LPV/r with 87% accuracy.
   Conclusions: Metabolites alterations in treatment-na ve HIV patients may indicate an inflammatory, oxidative state and mitochondrial dysfunction that is permissive for disease progression. Histidine may provide a specific protective function for HIV patients. Besides, elevated fatty acids levels including butyrylcarnitine and myristic acid after infection may indicate patients at risk of suffering from dyslipidemia after LPV/r-based HAART.

AB HIV infection markedly increases the likelihood of latent tuberculosis infection progressing to active TB. Information on expression of TLR-2, myeloid differentiation factor (MyD88), IL-1R- associated kinase-4 (IRAK4) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) in HIV +LTBI + and HIV + patients with active TB disease is limited. We found significantly higher percentages of CD14 + TLR2 + cells in PBMCs of HIV + LTBI + patients compared to HIV LTBI + individuals. gamma-irradiated Mtb was unable to induce MyD88, IRAK4 expression and IL-1 beta, MCP-1, IP-10 production in HIV + LTBI + patients. Pleural fluids from HIV + TB+ patients had low IL-1 beta, MCP-1, IP-10 and high IL-10, TNF-alpha production. gamma-irradiated Mtb stimulated CD14 + cells from HIV + TB + patients had low IL-1 beta, MCP-1, IP-10 production and MyD88, IRAK4 and similar NF-kB expression compared to those from of HIV TB+ patients. Our results suggest defective MyD88, IRAK4 but not NF-kB inhibit IL-1 beta, MCP-1 and IP-10 production by CD14 + cells of HIV + individuals with LTBI and active TB disease in peripheral blood and at the site of disease.

AB The "danger" model of immunology states that the immune system detects and responds to danger by releasing endogenous molecules called alarmins. Strenuous exercise perturbs physiological homeostasis, increasing circulating alarmins to drive the inflammatory response. We describe a working concept of exercise-induced High Mobility Group Box (HMGB)1, a prototypical alarmin, in modulating immune responses and adaptations.

AB Peptic ulcer is a lesion in the mucosa of the digestive tract affecting many people all around the world. Recent investigations have indicated that produced inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta in response to gastric infection by Helicobacter pylori play an important role in the development of peptic ulcer. With regard to the significance of these cytokines in peptic ulcer development and the high prevalence of this disease in the developing countries, this study aimed to investigate the association of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta with peptic ulcer in the presence of H. pylori. This case-control study enrolled 61 patients with peptic ulcer disease (PUD) as cases and 59 people without peptic ulcer (NPUD) as controls. Blood samples and endoscopic biopsies were collected. H. pylori infection was confirmed by using rapid urease test (RUT), specific IgG measurement and histopathological examination. Then, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha levels were evaluated using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The seropositivity of H. pylori was 62.5% in the studied population, while by considering RUT and histopathological examination along with specific-IgG antibody, H. pylori infection decreased to 56.7%. In addition, H. pylori infection was significantly (OR = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.17-0.82; P =.02) associated with peptic ulcer development. The TNF-alpha level in PUD and infected H. pylori subjects was significantly higher than that of control and un-infected H. pylori individuals. However, no significant difference of IL1 beta level was observed between PUD and control groups as well as between H. pylori infected and un-infected individuals. Interestingly, IL-1 beta level in PUD patients without H. pylori infection was significantly higher than infected ones. Moreover, a significant correlation between specific-IgG antibody with TNF-alpha level was observed. Taken together, our results showed that increased level of TNF-alpha could probably play pivotal role in pathogenesis of peptic ulcer in the presence of H. pylori infection. These findings also highlighted the importance of IL-1 beta in the absence of H. pylori infection in peptic ulcer development.

AB Objective: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic inflammatory liver disease mediated by an autoimmune reaction to hepatocytes, the present study aimed to assess the possible associations between interleukin-4 (IL-4) variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) and IL-4-590 promoter polymorphisms and susceptibility to autoimmune hepatitis type 1 in children.
   Subjects and methods: The study was performed on 101 children diagnosed with AIH and 104 apparently healthy, age and sex-matched control children, diagnosis of AIH was based on the simplified score for the diagnosis of AIH. Genotyping for the IL-4 VNTR and IL-4-590 were performed using PCR-RFLP.
   Results: The distribution of genotype frequencies of IL-4 gene intron 3 VNTR polymorphism were not significantly different between AIH patients and controls for 3R/2R and 2R/2R genotypes, while the 2R allele distribution was significantly higher among AIH patients than the control group. The frequency of IL-4-590 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) CT and TT genotypes was statistically higher among AIH patients than controls.
   Conclusion: This study revealed the presence of an association between IL-4-590 TT genotype and T alleles with increased AIH risk in pediatric patients, also assess its severity as they were detected with Child Plugh scores B and C.

AB Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) triggers a cascade of secondary biological and physiological effects that are variable, depending on the severity, location, and complexity of the injury. Improved diagnosis and prognosis of brain injury may be possible by examining changes in protein biomarker concentrations and, determining their role in long-term outcomes may improve treatment. One promising direction for biomarker research surrounds pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines which may have utility for predicting short and long-term prognosis after and may also be therapeutic targets in shaping neuronal recovery following a TBI. The purpose of this review is to examine the relationship between TBI symptoms and changes in pro- and anti- inflammatory biomarkers. Eighteen (18) published articles met criteria for inclusion. Fourteen studies focused on individuals with severe TBI. Increased levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, IL-8, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) were associated with worse outcomes, with most studies focusing on morbidity and mortality. It is important to identify the biochemical changes that may influence or initiate the presentation of health outcomes after a um. Earlier identification of symptoms associated with these biochemical changes can be used to support better treatment planning, targeted interventions and ultimately, improvement in patient outcomes.

AB This study examined the acute and chronic effects of euhydrated and hypohydrated heat exposure, on biomarkers of stress and inflammation. Eight trained males [mean (SD) age: 21 (3) y; mass: 77.30 (4.88) kg; (V)over dot(2max): 56.9 (7.2) mL kg(-1) min(-1)] undertook two heat acclimation programmes (balanced cross-over design), once drinking to maintain euhydration and once with restricted fluid-intake (permissive dehydration). Days 1, 6, and 11 were 60 min euhydrated exercise-heat stress tests (40 degrees C; 50% RH, 35% peak power output), days 2-5 and 7-10 were 90 min, isothermal-strain (target rectal temperature: 38.5 degrees C) exercise-heat sessions. Plasma was obtained pre- and post- exercise on day 1, 2, and 11 and analysed for cortisol, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Cortisol and CRP were also assessed on day 6. IL-6 was elevated following the initial (acute) 90 min isothermal heat strain exercise-heat exposure (day 2) with permissive dehydration ((pre exercise: 1.0 pg mL(-1) [0.9], post-exercise: 1.8 pg mL(-1) [1.0], P =.032) and when euhydrated (pre-exercise: 1.0 pg mL(-1) [1.4], post-exercise: 1.6 pg mL(-1) [2.1], P =.048). Plasma cortisol levels were also elevated but only during permissive dehydration (P =.032). Body mass loss was strongly correlated with Delta cortisol (r =- 0.688, P =.003). Although there was a trend for post-exercise cortisol to be decreased following both heat acclimation programmes (chronic effects), there were no within or between intervention differences in IL-6 or CRP. In conclusion, acute exercise in the heat increased IL-6 and cortisol only when fluid-intake is restricted. There were no chronic effects of either intervention on biomarkers of inflammation as evidenced by IL-6 and CRP returning to basal level at the end of heat acclimation.

AB Background: Zinc deficiency may play an important role in the development of atopic asthma. The aim of the work: To assess serum zinc levels in adult atopic, non-atopic asthmatic patients, and in healthy controls and to investigate its modulatory effect on production of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in vitro.
   Methods: Sixty asthmatics and 30 apparently healthy volunteers were included in this study. All patients were subjected to history taking, clinical examination, pulmonary function tests, skin prick test (SPT), serum zinc assessment by a colorimetric method as well as serum total IgE measurement by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). PBMCs were activated in vitro in the presence and absence of zinc, and then cell culture supernatants were analyzed for IFN-gamma and IL-10 by ELISA.
   Results: Serum zinc levels were significantly lower in atopic asthmatics than non-atopic asthmatics and healthy controls. In atopic asthmatics, highly significant correlations were found between zinc levels and total Ig E levels as well as FEV1. In culture, zinc triggers IFN-gamma and inhibits IL-10 production by PBMCs, in atopic asthmatics. In non atopic asthmatics and healthy controls, IFN-gamma and IL-10 were slightly affected by zinc supplementation in culture.
   Conclusion: Serum zinc levels affect asthma phenotypes. Atopic asthmatics might benefit from zinc supplements.

AB Sterile cure from visceralized Leishmania donovani (L. donovani) needs Thl cell support along with the assistance from innate immune cells, NK cells and NKT cells. NKT cells play as a connecting link between innate and adaptive immune cell and support T helper cell function. Earlier, a categorical function of CD56 positive CD4(+) or CD8(+) NKT cells was reported in visceral leishmaniasis (VL). It was observed in in vitro that CD4 CD56 +NKT cells, but not CD8 CD56 +NKT cells, were accumulated at the L. donovani infection site. Therefore, in vitro experiments have been carried out to decipher the mechanism behind preferential accumulation of CD4 (+)CD56 'NKT cells at infection site. In this study, 1.89 fold higher expression of CCL4/MIP-113 was noticed in infected macrophages. The higher expression of CCL4 was correlated with preferential accumulation of CCR5(+)CD4(+)CD56 +NKT cells and apoptosis of CD8 CD56 +NKT cells at in vitro infection site. The CD4 (+)CD56(+)NKT cells were also observed expressing TGF-beta dominantly. Interaction of CCL4 chemotaxis was interrupted by blocking, which led to drift back the TGF-beta producing CD4 CD56(+)NKT cells and promoted CD8(+) CD56 +NKT cells recruitment in in vitro infection site. CCR5 blockade also reduced CD25 and FoxP3 positive CD4 CD56(+)NKT cells in in vitro infection site. Therefore, it was concluded that Leishmania promotes strategic expression of CCL4, which alternately attracts CCR5 cells, mostly expressing regulatory cytokines, at infection site. This reduces the CD8 CD56 NKT cells at infection site through Smad4 mediated TGF-beta expression and activation of caspases. Data indicates that L. donovani induces higher expression of CCL4 in host cell to attract CCR5(+) cells under its strategic plan to downregulate host immune response.

AB In the present report we describe the involvement of transforming growth factor B1 (TGF) in functional regression and structural luteolysis in the mare. Firstly, TGF and its receptors activin-like kinase (ALK) 5 and TGF receptor 2 were identified in corpus luteum (CL) steroidogenic, endothelial and fibroblast-like cells. Also, TGF and ALK5 protein expression were shown to be increased in Mid-, and Late-CL (p < 0.05). Subsequently, using an in vitro model with Mid-CL cells, we studied the role of TGF on secretory activity and cell viability. Cell treatment with TGF decreased progesterone (P4) and prostaglandin (PG) E2 concentrations in culture media (p < 0.05), and downregulated mRNA and protein of StAR, CYP11A1, cPGES and mPGES1 (p < 0.05). Conversely, TGF augmented PGF2a concentration in culture media, through PTGS2 and PGFS gene expression activation (p < 0.05). When cells were incubated with PGF2a, both TGF and ALK5 were upregulated (p < 0.05). Additionally, treatment with the pharmacological inhibitor of ALK5, ALK4 and ALK7- SB431542 (SB) attenuated PGF2a functional and structural luteolytic actions. Indeed, SB blocked: (i) PGF2a inhibitory effect on StAR, CYP11A1, 3BHSD and mPGES1; (ii) PGF2a auto-amplification signal via PTGS2 and PGFS expression (p < 0.05); (iii) the PGF2a-induced BAX and FASL expression (p < 0.05). Finally, TGF decreased cell viability (p < 0.05) and promoted caspase 3 activity (p = 0.08) and the expression of pro-apoptotic FASL and BAX (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that TGF supports functional regression and structural luteolysis, and also confirm the importance of ALK5, ALK4 and ALK7 activation during PGF2a mediated luteolysis in mares.

AB The present investigation was undertaken to assess the result of pretreatment of luteolin in sepsis-induced acute lung injury in mice and its mechanism of action. Luteolin was administered intraperitoneally one hour before caeca] ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery in mice. Acute lung injury was assessed by estimation of different parameters like lung edema, protein content, cytokines level, oxidative stress, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expression and histopathology. Pretreatment of mice with luteolin showed decrease lung edema and protein content in tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). However, mice pretreated with luteolin showed reduction (p = 0.92) in blood and lung tissue bacterial counts however it was non significant. Further, luteolin showed significant reduction in interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1 beta in lung tissue which are the proinflammatory cytokines. However, plasma IL-1 beta and tissue tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha level decrease (p = 0.24; p = 0.19) with this pretreatment. Further, ICAM-1 mRNA expression and nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B protein expression were significantly (p < 0.01) decreased in luteolin pretreated septic mice. The lung iNOS level, iNOS mRNA and protein expressions were markedly (p = 0.25; p = 0.50; p = 0.06) altered with luteolin pretreatment, respectively. Also, significant reduction in lipid peroxidation and increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase was noted with luteolin pretreatment. However, luteolin did not alter (p = 0.36) the non enzymatic antioxidant GSH activity in septic mice. Histopathology of lung tissue showed reduction in lung injury with the luteolin pretreatment in septic mice. The study suggests that luteolin showed attenuation in sepsis-induced acute lung injury in mice through suppression in ICAM-1, NF-kappa B, oxidative stress and partially iNOS pathways.

AB Poly-gamma-D-glutamic acid (PGA) of anthrax is an important pathogenic factor due to its anti-phagocytic activity. Additionally, PGA has the ability to activate mouse macrophages for the secretion of cytokines through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2. Peptidoglycan (PGN), a major bacterial cell-wall component, induces inflammatory responses in the host. We assessed whether PGA can induce maturation and cytokine expression in immature mouse dendritic cells (DCs) in the existence of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), the minimum motif of PGN with immunostimulatory activity. Stimulation of immature DCs with PGA or MDP alone augmented expression of costimulatory molecules and MHC class II proteins, which are all cell surface markers indicative of maturation. The observed effects were further enhanced by costimulation of PGA and MDP. PGA alone was sufficient to induce expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, MCP-1, and MIP1-alpha, whereas MDP alone did not under the same conditions. Treatment with MDP enhanced PGA-induced expression of the tested inflammatory mediators; however, the synergistic effect found for PGA and MDP was not observed in TLR2- or nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) 2 knockout DCs. Additionally, MDP augmented PGA-induced MAP kinases and NF-kappa B activation, which is crucial for expression of cytokines. Furthermore, MAP kinase and NF-kappa B inhibitors attenuated MDP enhancement of PGA-induced cytokine production. In addition, co-culture of splenocytes and PGA/MDP-matured DCs induced higher expression of IL-2 and IFN-gamma compared to that of splenocytes and PGA-matured DCs. Collectively, our results suggest that PGA and MDP cooperatively induce inflammatory responses in mouse DCs through TLR2 and NOD2 via MAP kinase and NF-kappa B pathways, subsequently leading to lymphocyte activation.

AB Resistin, a previously discovered cysteine-rich adipokine known to regulate glucose metabolism, has been emerged as a mediator in inflammation and immunity. Its level was supposed to be related to the expression of indicators, such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in inflammation. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was reported to be a receptor for resistin in cells, like leukocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). However, the pro-inflammatory role of resistin and its intracellular mechanisms in alveolar macrophages have not been thoroughly validated. Here we found that the pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) was positively correlated with resistin. Our results also showed that resistin induced the expression of TLR4, intracellular molecules myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88), TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) in PAMs. In contrast, inhibition of TLR4, MyD88, TRAM and NF-kappa B abrogated the pro-inflammatory effect of resistin on PAMs. Additionally, the associations among TLR4, MyD88/TRAM and NF-kappa B were investigated by introducing TLR4-siRNA, MyD88-siRNA and TRAM-siRNA respectively into PAMs prior to the treatment with resistin. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that resistin promoted the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine in PAMs via TLR4/NF-kappa B-mediated pathway (TLR4/MyD88/TFtAM/NF-kappa B).

AB The efficiency of the immune system has been shaped throughout the evolutionary process allowing adaptations. In a Plasmodium vivax infection, the host attempts to develop an innate immune response to keep in check the parasite that is associated with inflammatory and regulatory processes. Production of pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines simultaneously appears to be a balancing mechanism for the host to prevent the onset of severe disease. Changes in the dynamics of circulating cytokines production can influence the pathogenesis, severity of the disease and episodes of recurrent Plasmodium vivax malaria (Pv-malaria). A cross-sectional study was conducted in endemic areas for Pv-malaria in the Amazonas State, Brazil. Several SNPs in TLR genes were genotyped by PCR-RFLP in 137 patients infected with P. vivax. Circulating cytokines IL-6, TNF, IL-2, IL-10, IFN-y and IL-4 were measured by CBA. Influence of the studied SNPs on circulating cytokines was investigated by applying the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunns' multiple comparison post-test. A Spearman correlation test also was performed to elaborate circulating cytokine networks and to demonstrate the level of interaction between each molecule. Individuals with genotypes A/G (TLR4 A299G), C/C (TLR6 S249P) and T/T (TLR9-1486C/ T) appear to produce less/gain IL-6, IFN-y, IL-10, IL-2 and IL-4 compared to patients with wild-type and heterozygous genotypes. In addition, these genotypes seem to influence the interaction network between the molecules studied, causing a lower interaction, absence or even negative interaction between the cytokines. Data presented in this study suggests the influence of polymorphisms TLR4 (A299G), TLR6 (S249P) and TLR9 (-1486C/T) on the production of circulating cytokines during Pv-malaria.

AB Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani, is a potentially fatal disease. The only orally bioavailable drug miltefosine is toxic and the effective liposomal Amphotericin B (AmBisome) is limited by its prohibitive cost and requirement for parenteral administration. Therefore, finding a new potential drug candidate and an alternative delivery system is imperative. We report that Betulinic acid (BA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid from Betula alba bark, was loaded onto uniformly spherical PLGA nanoparticles (BANPs; diameter 187.5 5.60 nm) coated with Lactoferrin (Lf-BANPs). The amastigotes count in macrophages was more effectively reduced by Lf-BANP than BA and BANP. Lf-BANPs reduced the pro-parasitic, anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, but increased nitric oxide (NO), production in L. donovani-infected macrophages indicating that LfBANP possesses a significant anti-leishmanial activity.

AB The Resistin-Like Molecules (RELM) alpha, beta, and gamma and their namesake, resistin, share structural and sequence homology but exhibit significant diversity in expression and function within their mammalian host. RELM proteins are expressed in a wide range of diseases, such as: microbial infections (eg. bacterial and helminth), inflammatory diseases (eg. asthma, fibrosis) and metabolic disorders (eg. diabetes). While the expression pattern and molecular regulation of RELM proteins are well characterized, much controversy remains over their proposed functions, with evidence of host-protective and pathogenic roles. Moreover, the receptors for RELM proteins are unclear, although three receptors for resistin, decorin, adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1), and Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) have recently been proposed. In this review, we will first summarize the molecular regulation of the RELM gene family, including transcription regulation and tissue expression in humans and mouse disease models. Second, we will outline the function and receptor-mediated signaling associated with RELM proteins. Finally, we will discuss recent studies suggesting that, despite early misconceptions that these proteins are pathogenic, RELM proteins have a more nuanced and potentially beneficial role for the host in certain disease settings.

AB This study aims to investigate the clinical significance of serum soluble CD163 (sCD163) levels as a predictor of the disease activity of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (s-JIA). In this study, we examined 63 patients with sJIA, four with Epstein-Barr virus-induced hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH), and seven with Kawasaki disease (KD), along with 14 healthy controls. We quantified serum cytokine levels (sCD163, neopterin, IL-18, IL-6) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared the results with the clinical features of s-JIA. Serum sCD163 levels were significantly elevated in patients with s-JIA associated macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and EBV-HLH compared to those in patients with acute-phase s-JIA and KD. In addition, serum sCD163 levels profoundly increased with the progress of MAS and correlated positively with the disease activity of s-JIA, even in patients receiving tocilizumab. Furthermore, serum sCD163 levels significantly decreased in the inactive phase compared to those in the active phase and normalized in remission. The correlation between macrophage activation and serum sCD163 levels might be a unique indicator of the disease activity and a potential diagnostic laboratory criterion for clinical remission in patients with s-JIA, including those receiving tocilizumab.

AB Sepsis, as a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) subtype, is generally characterized by infection. Emerging evidence has highlighted dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the progression of sepsis. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of miR-335-5p on inflammatory responses in a septic mouse model. The hypothesis was subsequently asserted that the FASN gene and AMPK/ULK1 signaling pathway may participate in the regulation of miR-335-5p. A septic mouse model was established in order to validate the effect of miR-335-5p on the inflammatory response by means of suppressing the endogenous expression of FASN by siRNA against FASN in endothelial cells. A target prediction program and luciferase activity was employed to ascertain as to whether miR-335-5p targets FASN. The levels of inflammatory factors including IL-6 and IL-1 beta were determined by means of ELISA assay. RT-qPCR and western blot analysis were used to determine the AMPK/ULK1 signaling pathway-, apoptosis- and autophagy-related genes. Flow cytometry was employed in order to evaluate sepsis-induced cell apoptosis in response to miR-335-5p and FASN alternations. FASN was identified as a target gene of miR-335-5p. Gain- and loss-of-function studies revealed that miR-335-5p acted to enhance autophagy, reduce cell apoptosis, promote cell cycle entry in endothelial cells, and reduce inflammatory response through the modulation of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors in endothelial cells. The effect of miR-335-5p on endothelial cells was increased when FASN was suppressed by siRNA as well as when the AMPK/ULK1 signaling pathway was activated, suggesting that miR-335-5p influences sepsis by targeting and inhibiting FASN, and activating the AMPK/ULK1 signaling pathway. Our study provides evidence indicating that overexpressed miR-335-5p enhances autophagy by targeting FASN through activation of the AMPK/ULK1 signaling pathway working to alleviate the inflammatory response in septic mouse models, emphasizing the value of the functional upregulation of miR-335-5p as therapeutic strategy for sepsis.

AB The construction of check dams and terraces, and the 'Grain-for-Green' project are major soil and water conservation measures on the Loess Plateau, China. The sediment load of the Yellow River has decreased by approximately 90% over the past 60 years and its average annual runoff has reduced from 55.9 billion m(3) to 45.6 billion m(3). However, whether watersheds act as sources or sinks of soil nitrogen following ecological construction measures is unknown. To understand the impacts of check dams combined with forests, grasslands, and terraces on soil nitrogen content, soil samples were collected at 20-cm intervals down to a depth of 60 cm across a small watershed of the Loess Plateau. The probability density function of the Weibull distribution was used to analyze the nitrogen sources in dammed farmland. The results indicated the mean soil total nitrogen (STN) concentrations at soil depths of 0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm in the watershed were 0.45, 0.32 and 0.29 g/kg, respectively. The STN concentrations among the three soil layers showed significant differences (p < 0.01). The mean STN concentration decreased as follows: dammed farmland > grassland > forestland > terrace > sloping cropland. Slope and soil texture had a significant impact on STN concentration across the watershed. The STN density of terrace, grassland, forestland, sloping cropland and dam farmland at a soil depth of 0-60 cm were 0.271, 0.289, 0.279, 0.264, and 0.288 kg/m(2), respectively. The source percentages of STN deposited in dam farmland were 51% (grassland), 34% (forestland) and 15% (sloping cropland). Thus, check dam constructions have made the role of gully in the small watershed as a sink for soil nitrogen.

AB Uneven water distribution, misuse of water and inefficient watering techniques are some of the major causes playing devastation with water security, therefore, the aim of this work was to explore managing drip irrigation of wheat grown under heavy soil conditions as a tool for increasing crop yield, enlarging water productivity and saving irrigation water for newly reclaimed areas. A field investigation was conducted to study the impact of drip irrigation lateral arrangements (single and double lateral line a bed) and irrigation intervals (4-, 8-, and 12-days) on yield and water efficiency of wheat. Results revealed the grain yield was marginally influenced by irrigation intervals under double and single line a bed. As well, the grain yield got at 8- and 12-day intervals with double lateral line (8.28 and 7.62 Mg.ha(-1), respectively), were higher compared with 4-day and the less grain yield was achieved by surface irrigation (control). Distributing water and salts were better under double lines a bed compared to single line under the same irrigation intervals. The highest value of water use efficiency of grain yield was 7.4 at 8-day followed by 6.62, 5.50 and 1.58 kgm(-3) for 12-, 4-day and surface irrigation, respectively performed for double lines a bed with water saving 6.7% and 65% compared to 12-day and surface irrigation respectively.

AB Soils polluted by persistent organic pollutants threatens habitats for plants and animals as well as basic human needs such as food security and provision of potable water. Toxaphene is a persistent organic pollutant that was heavily used as a pesticide in Central America, Brazil, Soviet Union etc. until it was banned in 1993. The objective of this study was to determine the bioaccumulation and translocation characteristics of three different cultivars of amaranth in soils contaminated with field-weathered toxaphene and other POPs in former cotton fields in Chinandega, Nicaragua to identify safety issues for human consumption and/or potential for phytoremediation. The concentration of toxaphene and other POPs in the edible parts of the amaranth (leaves and seeds) exceeded the maximum residue level for human consumption established by the European Union for most of the tested compounds. Concentrations of toxaphene congeners and other POPs were found in all vegetative organs. Many substances were accumulated to concentrations more than 10 times higher than in the soil. Of the three cultivars, A. caudatus 'CAC48 Peru' and A. cruentus 'Don Leon' presented the highest average BAF. None of the 3 cultivars can be considered a panacea hyperaccumulator for either toxaphene alone or in conjunction with other POPs but since many agricultural soils comprise a range of different contaminants, the broad-spectrum bioaccumulating capacity of amaranth can make it an interesting candidate for phytoremediation.

AB Dense-foliage tamarisk (Tamarix chinensis) varieties are widely planted for landscape construction projects in the highly saline coastal soil of northern China. Because these plants are salt-secreting halophytes, their growth in arid land usually leads to soil salinization and water loss. In this work, a tamarisk plantation was established in a coastal area within a semi-arid region of China, and the water content, salinity levels and spatial distribution patterns in the soil were analysed in 1 x 1 m grids of a 10 x 10 m sample plot in July 2014 and July 2016. Four layers of soil within the 0-80 cm profile were sampled, and the soil water, salt, Na+ and Cl- contents and pH were determined. In 2016, the soil water content had decreased slightly, and the soil salt content had increased by 0.49 g kg(-1), representing a 7.0% increase compared with the value in 2014. Both the soil Cl- and Na+ content increased from 2014 to 2016, accounting for a greater fraction of the total salt, and the mean soil pH also increased by approximately 0.4. The spatial variation was weaker in the deeper layers but moderate in the surface layer. After tamarisk establishment, the spatial variation in soil salinity declined and showed a trend toward homogeneity. The secreted salt and litterfall from the tamarisk might explain the higher soil salinity and increased homogeneity, which suggests that tamarisk growth will lead to increased soil salinity and a more homogeneous salt distribution throughout the soil.

AB Engineered biochars were prepared by slow pyrolysis of three types of biomass pretreated with eggshell waste. The resulting biochars were composite materials with eggshell particles on carbon surface within the pore networks, which were confirmed by various characterization tools. The engineered biochars showed relatively fast adsorption kinetics to Pb2+ aqueous solutions. In addition, adsorption isotherms showed that the Langmuir maximum Pb2+ adsorption capacities of the engineered biochars (103-261 mg/g) were higher than those of the pristine biochars (32.9-56.0 mg/g). The adsorption of Pb2+ onto the biochars were affected by adsorbent dosage, initial solution pH, and ionic strength. Findings from this work indicated that the engineered biochar from eggshell-treated biochar can be used as an effective agent for soil and water remediation and conservation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Waste drilling fluids (WDF) is a complex mixture of different additives with different chemical and biologic properties, which have no biodegradability and seriously pollute the soil system without any disposal. After the later stage treatments, like landfill and solidification, waste drilling fluids also have potential detrimental to the environment and health. In this paper, a formula has been studied that can turn the waste water-based drilling fluids into an environment friendly soil. The treatment process can realize the harmless disposal and effective utilization of water-based drilling wastes. In the laboratory column study, by assessing the germination time and growth of ten kinds of plants which were grown on the high quality soil mixture with the waste drilling fluids (10:1, wt:wt), the Festuca arundinacea seed was selected to evaluate the quality of the soil. The formulas were used as a treatment agent mixing with drilling wastes collected from drilling well sites in Dagang, Tianjing, China with design of orthogonal experiment. The analysis was comprised of evaluation of heavy metals, chemical oxygen demand (COD), soluble salt content, and pH. The formula (20%coal + 10%solid sludge +5%chips) was proposed as a low-cost strategy to reduce leaching of toxic elements, and improve plant establishment. The concentrations of heavy metals in leachate solution exacting from the soil were lower than the EPA toxicity limit set by USEPA. The pH was approximately 7 similar to 8. COD was less than 100 mg O-2/L and the soluble salt content was less than 25 g/kg. In the Field application, the environment friendly formula developed in this study has been successfully applied to Dagang Oilfield. The treated waste drilling fluids are favorable to the growth of the plants (the soil organic matter is more than 30 g/kg, the porosity is more than 50%). The treatment process is easy to handle, low-cost (< 100RMB/m(3)) and realizes a new, sustainable soil resources for landscaping. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objectives: To assess factors associated with pregnancy fatalism among U.S. adult women.
   Study design: I used data from the Change and Consistency in Contraceptive Use study, which collected information from a national sample of 4634 U.S. women aged 18-39 at baseline (59% response rate). I assessed pregnancy fatalism based on agreement with the statement: "It doesn't matter whether I use birth control, when it is my time to get pregnant, it will happen." I compared fatalism among all respondents to fatalism among respondents who were trying to get pregnant and those who did not want to get pregnant but were not using contraception. I used logistic regression to assess associations between nonuse of contraception and pregnancy fatalism at baseline and whether respondents were trying to get pregnant 6 months later.
   Results: Overall, 36% of the sample expressed some degree of pregnancy fatalism, and proportions were higher for respondents trying to get pregnant (55%) and those not using contraception (57%). The association between pregnancy fatalism and trying to get pregnant was maintained after controlling for other characteristics [odds ratio (OR) 1.4, p=.01], as was the association for nonuse of contraception (OR 2.08, p<.001). Contraceptive nonusers at baseline were more likely than users to be trying to get pregnant 6 months later, especially if they expressed a fatalistic outlook at baseline.
   Conclusions: Pregnancy fatalism may be a common outlook among women who are trying to get pregnant. Associations between fatalism and nonuse of contraception may be more complex than previously recognized. Implications: Gaining a better understanding of the dynamics of pregnancy planning might inform our understanding of why some women do not use contraception. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: We examined whether the experience of a "pregnancy scare" is related to subsequent changes in contraceptive use that increase the risk of unintended pregnancy.
   Methods: We used data from the Relationship Dynamics and Social Life (RDSL) study, which interviewed a random, population-based sample of 1003 young women weekly for 2.5 years. We used multivariate regression models to predict the effect of experiencing a pregnancy scare on change in contraceptive use.
   Results: We found pregnancy scares are associated with changes in contraceptive use that increase the risk of pregnancy. Experiencing a pregnancy scare is related to discontinued contraceptive use, change from consistent to inconsistent use of contraception, and change from a more effective to a less effective method of contraception. We also found pregnancy scares are associated with continued inconsistent use of contraception.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the experience of a pregnancy scare does not serve as a "wake-up call" to start using contraception, to start using it consistently, or to switch to a more effective method to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy. Instead, contraceptive use after a pregnancy scare typically remains the same or worsens. Implications: Clinicians should be aware that young women who have experienced pregnancy scares may be at increased risk of unintended pregnancy, relative to young women who did not experience a pregnancy scare.

DT Article
DE Transgender; Contraception; Family planning; Female-to-male; Transman
ID UNITED-STATES; PREGNANCY
AB Objectives: Female-to-male (FTM) transgender men (affirmed males) can experience planned and unplanned pregnancy during and after testosterone therapy. We conducted an exploratory study to understand current contraceptive practices and fertility desires among transgender men during and after transitioning.
   Study design: Self-identified transgender and transmasculine individuals assigned female at birth, ages 18-45, completed an anonymous online survey derived from standardized family planning surveys. We recruited participants from LGBT health centers, online listservs, and online groups for transgender men and used a mixed methods analysis to evaluate quantitative and qualitative data.
   Results: Of the one hundred and ninety-seven participants included in the study, the median age was 30 years old, most respondents were white, and 86% were taking masculinizing hormones (testosterone). Of the 60 pregnancies reported, 10 (17%) pregnancies occurred after stopping testosterone, 1 (1.6%) while taking testosterone irregularly, and 5 of 7 abortions occurred in participants who had been using testosterone in the past. Over half of the respondents desired at least one child, and a quarter reported fears of not getting pregnant. The majority of participants reporting using contraception (n=110, 60.1%), with condoms and pills used most commonly (n= 90, 49.2% and n=62, 33.9% respectively). Methods of contraception used did not differ between testosterone users and non-users, except for hormonal IUDs (20% testosterone versus 7% non-testosterone). Thirty participants (16.4%) believed that testosterone was a form of contraception, and 10 (5.5%) participants reported that their healthcare providers advised testosterone as contraception.
   Conclusion: Transgender men use contraception and can experience pregnancy and abortion, even after transitioning socially and hormonally. Transgender men need counseling and care regarding reproductive health, including contraceptive and conception counseling.
   Implications: Providers should be aware that transgender men may desire pregnancy and use contraception; this study highlights the need for further research regarding fertility, fertility desires, and optimal contraception among transgender men. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of sexual-minority women among clients in family planning centers and explore differences in LARC uptake by both sexual identity (i.e., exclusively heterosexual, mostly heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian) and sexual behavior in the past 12 months (i.e., only male partners, both male and female partners, only female partners, no partners) among those enrolled in the survey arm of the HER Salt Lake Contraceptive Initiative.
   Methods: This survey categorized participants into groups based on reports of sexual identity and sexual behavior. We report contraceptive uptake by these factors, and we used logistic and multinomial logistic models to assess differences in contraceptive method selection by sexual identity and behavior.
   Results: Among 3901 survey respondents, 32% (n=1230) identified with a sexual-minority identity and 6% had had a female partner in the past 12 months. By identity, bisexual and mostly heterosexual women selected an IUD or implant more frequently than exclusively heterosexual women and demonstrated a preference for the copper T380 IUD. Exclusively heterosexual and lesbian women did not differ in their contraceptive method selection, however, by behavior, women with only female partners selected IUDs or implants less frequently than those with only male partners.
   Conclusion: One in three women attending family planning centers for contraception identified as a sexual minority. Sexual-minority women selected IUDs or implants more frequently than exclusively heterosexual women. Implications: Providers should avoid care assumptions based upon sexual identity. Sexual-minority women should be offered all methods of contraception and be provided with inclusive contraceptive counseling conversations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Young women may experience social barriers to achieving their reproductive goals. This analysis explored whether low social support may contribute to the high incidence of undesired pregnancy in young women in the United States.
   Study design: Using 6 months of data from a prospective cohort of 970 women ages 18-22 years in the United States, we described contraceptive use and applied multivariable logistic regression and standardization to estimate adjusted odds and absolute risk of undesired pregnancy among women reporting low social support versus higher social support. We investigated several measures of contraceptive use as possible explanations for this pathway.
   Results: Sixty-five pregnancies were reported in the 6 months of the study, of which 30 (46%) were classified as undesired prior to conception. Among young women who reported low social support, 8% reported an undesired pregnancy during the study period as compared to 3% of the young women who reported higher levels of social support. Among non-black women, those who reported low social support had nearly seven times the odds of an undesired pregnancy as compared to women who reported higher social support (aOR: 6.8, 95%Cl: 1.7, 27.1). We found no association between social support and undesired pregnancy among young black women. Contraceptive method use differed by social support at baseline, and throughout follow-up.
   Conclusions: Low social support defined as the feeling of not having anyone to turn to- may be a risk factor for persistently high levels of undesired pregnancy among young women in the U.S. This association may be driven by differences in contraceptive use by level of social support.
   Implications: Interventions to increase young women's perceptions of social support may reduce the risk of undesired pregnancy for some individuals. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To evaluate the effect of miPlan, a waiting-room contraceptive counseling mobile application (app), on interest in discussing long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) during the clinical encounter and LARC uptake.
   Study design: This randomized controlled trial evaluated the miPlan contraceptive counseling app. African American and Latina young women ages 15-29 years attending four family planning clinics in a large Midwestern city were randomized to either: (1) use miPlan (intervention) prior to the contraceptive clinic visit or (2) contraceptive clinic visit alone (control). Groups were compared on knowledge of contraceptive effectiveness, interest in discussing LARC, behavioral intentions to use LARC, and LARC uptake.
   Results: From February 2015 to January 2016, 207 young women were randomized to intervention (n=104) or control (n=103) group. Immediately following app use, the intervention group had an increase in knowledge and interest in learning about the implant. Immediate post visit, there was no significant difference in uptake of LARC between the two groups (p>.05). At three months post intervention, app users reported more knowledge of IUD effectiveness (52.3% vs 30.8%, p=.001) compared to controls. There was no significant difference in LARC use.
   Conclusion: App use was not associated with an increase in using LARC methods. It was associated with increased knowledge of contraceptive effectiveness, an interest in learning about the implant, and behavioral intentions to use LARC methods.
   Implications: The miPlan app is a feasible clinic adjunct for increasing contraceptive knowledge and intentions, however, it is not associated with increased LARC use. Mobile applications can offer an accessible complement to the contraceptive counseling visit. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: This study describes the perspectives of patients and providers about intrauterine device (IUD) self-removal.
   Study design: This qualitative study is a subanalysis of two datasets from a single project, which included semistructured individual interviews with 15 patients and 12 physicians. We derived the data for this analysis from portions of the interviews pertaining to IUD self-removal and provider removal. We analyzed data using deductive and inductive techniques to perform content and thematic analyses.
   Results: The majority of patients and physicians cited both concerns about and potential benefits of IUD self removal. Patients cited concerns about safety as the reason they did not wish to remove their own IUD, but physicians did not share these concerns; instead, physicians were apprehensive about not being involved in the discussion to remove the IUD. Both patients and physicians valued having the provider "in the loop" and reported fears about hasty or coerced removal.
   Conclusions: IUD self-removal is an option that some patients may be interested in. Addressing concerns about safety may make self-removal more appealing to some patients. Addressing physicians' concern about "hasty" removal may require additional training so that providers are better able to support patients' decision making around contraceptive use.
   Implications: The option of self-removal could have a positive impact on reproductive autonomy and patient decision making. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc, All rights reserved.

   POPULATION
AB Objective: The objective was to identify predictors of postabortion long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) initiation to increase providers' understanding of motivators of contraceptive choices.
   Study design: We prospectively enrolled a cohort of women having abortions at <13 weeks' gestational age who were eligible to receive no-cost contraceptive methods immediately postprocedure (N=1662) to evaluate the demographic and reproductive factors associated with choosing and receiving a long-acting contraceptive versus a short-acting method. We used stepwise logistic regression to identify independent predictors of LARC initiation.
   Results: During the study period, 1072 (64.5%) chose an immediate postabortion LARC method and 590 (35.5%) chose another method. Compared to the group of women who chose a non-LARC method, women who chose a LARC method were more likely to have a surgical abortion and were younger, more likely to be Hispanic, more likely to live greater than 70 miles from the clinic, more likely to have a nonurban address and less likely to have had a prior abortion.
   Conclusions: We found that the differences in the demographic and reproductive factors of women choosing and receiving postabortion LARC were those which have been shown to be associated with difficulty in accessing contraception. Providers should offer a full range of contraceptive options to women immediately postabortion.
   Implications: Postabortion LARC is more likely to be utilized by women from groups who have been shown to have difficulty accessing traditional family planning clinical care: those who are young, do not live in a city and are from groups with recognized health disparities. Offering postabortion LARC increases the options for these women. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: To evaluate whether conducting a bimanual examination prior to medication abortion (MAB) provision results in meaningful changes in gestational age (GA) assessment after patient-reported last menstrual period (LMP) in Nepal.
   Study design: Women ages 16-45 (n=660) seeking MAB at twelve participating pharmacies and government health facilities, between October 2014 and September 2015, self-reported LMP. Trained auxiliary nurse midwives assessed GA using a bimanual exam after recording LMP. We compared GA assessments as measured via patient-reported LMP alone versus via LMP plus bimanual exam.
   Results: Overall, 660 women (326 at pharmacies, 334 at health facilities) presented for MAB, and 95% were able to provide an LMP. Overall agreement between LMP alone and LMP with bimanual exam was 99.3%. If LMP alone had been used without bimanual exam, fewer than one in 200 women would have been given MAB beyond the legal gestational limit. Among the three women who were <= 63 days by LMP but >63 days by bimanual exam, only one would have received MAB beyond 70 days gestation. Fewer than one in 600 women would not have received MAB care when eligible by adding a bimanual exam.
   Conclusion: There was high agreement between LMP alone and LMP plus bimanual exam. Routine bimanual exam may not be essential for safe and effective MAB care for women who are able to report an LMP. Removing the bimanual exam requirement could decrease barriers to provision outside of currently approved clinical settings and allow for expanded abortion access through provision by providers without bimanual exam training or facilities.
   Implications: Routine bimanual exams may not be essential for safe medication abortion provision by trained clinicians in pharmacies and health facilities in low resource settings like Nepal. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION; UNITED-STATES; CALIFORNIA
AB Objective: College students are known to experience unintended pregnancy and seek abortions. However, few student health centers currently offer abortion services. In this exploratory study, we aimed to expand understanding of student perspectives regarding on-campus abortion services.
   Study design: We invited UC Davis students to complete an anonymous web-based survey using 16 campus listservs and in-person recruitment. We elicited student knowledge of and opinions about on-campus Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS) with 29 questions.
   Results: The 502 participating students primarily identified as female (80%) and heterosexual (86%); most (90%) were undergraduates. In the past year, 9% of female respondents had used emergency contraception (EC), and 9% had sought clinic-based pregnancy testing. Only 68% of respondents were aware that SHCS provides EC. Although SHCS has not yet offered abortions, 24% of respondents believed that SHCS currently offers medication abortion and 13% believed that SHCS clinicians perform abortion procedures. Most respondents (64%) believed that SHCS should offer abortion services; 12% of respondents felt SHCS should not. Reasons for support of on-campus abortion services included the need to compassionately care for campus survivors of sexual assault and abortion's role in allowing students facing undesired pregnancy to complete their education. Reasons for opposition included concerns regarding SHCS's ability to offer high-quality abortion services, the potential for controversy related to on-campus abortion services and personal opposition to abortion.
   Conclusion: Most responding students favor on-campus abortion services, and a number of students incorrectly believe that abortion services are currently offered on the UC Davis campus.
   Implications: Student health centers should offer medication abortion on campus. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   Study design: SHC staff completed an online survey: we conducted site visits and conference calls with a subset of SHCs. The survey focused on barriers to abortion, resources needed for MA, and potential benefits and challenges.
   Results: 11 UCs (100%) and 20 CSUs (87%) completed surveys. All facilities provided basic primary care, including sexual and reproductive health services and some contraceptive services, but not abortion. All sites had adequate staffing and physical plant, but most would require training, access to ultrasound when needed, 24-hour hotlines (CSUs), and back-up care to provide MA. lusion: It would be feasible to provide MA at SHCs, but investment is needed to support staff training, equipment, 24-hour hotlines, back-up care, and minimal security upgrades, in order to implement MA services.
   Implications: If SB320 is passed, provision of MA services at student health centers could improve access to early abortion for students in California. This model may be scaled up at other universities around the country. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Women's decision making for postpartum sterilization: does the Medicaid
   waiting period add value?
SO CONTRACEPTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Postpartum sterilization; Decision making; Waiting period; Sterilization
   consent form
ID BARRIERS
AB Objectives: Currently, patients with federally funded insurance are required to sign a sterilization consent form (SCF) at least 30 days prior to sterilization, while privately insured patients are not. Although this policy was designed to protect the reproductive rights of vulnerable populations, it has had the unintended effect of creating a disparity in access to an effective contraceptive method. Our qualitative study aims to clarify the decision-making process surrounding postpartum sterilization and assess if patients perceive that the SCF adds value.
   Study design: We interviewed 25 women who underwent postpartum sterilization procedures, 10 with private insurance and 15 with Medicaid. Topics discussed included reproductive history, reason for choosing sterilization, decision-making timeline and value of the SCF. We transcribed and coded the interviews and identified themes.
   Results: Participant responses indicated that decision-making processes were similar between patients with private insurance and those with Medicaid. For most women, the decision to undergo sterilization took place over the course of their reproductive lives. Participants expressed that nonbiased provider counseling, autonomy and information from other women were helpful to their decision making. Most subjects felt that the SCF might benefit other women but did not/would not affect their own decision making.
   Conclusions: We did not find evidence suggesting that women with private insurance and women with Medicaid should be subjected to disparate restrictions on sterilization based on differences in decision-making processes. Characteristics of the decision-making process that women value, which in this population did not include the SCF, should be prioritized.
   Implications: Given the potential negative consequences associated with the SCF including its disproportionate burden on women of low socioeconomic status, the lack of value added to the decision-making process for postpartum sterilization reported by our participants provides further evidence for reevaluation of the policy.

   following mifepristone treatment

AB Objective: The progesterone receptor modulator (PRM) mifepristone holds the potential to be developed for regular contraception. However, long-term treatment can cause thickening of the endometrium and PRM-associated endometrial changes (PAEC). The objective of this study was to explore the molecular expression of endometrium displaying PAEC after mifepristone treatment in order to understand the future implications of PAEC and safety of long-term use.
   Study design: Endometrial biopsies were obtained from premenopausal women following 3 months of continuous mifepristone treatment. The biopsies were evaluated regarding occurrence of PAEC and followed up by a comparative analysis of gene expression in PAEC endometrium (n=7) with endometrium not displaying PAEC (n=4). Methods used included microarray analysis, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction.
   Results: Three genes relevant within endometrial function were up-regulated with PAEC: THY1 (p=.02), ADAM12 (p=.04) and TN-C (p=.04). The proliferation marker MKi67 was not altered (p=.31). None of the differentially regulated genes were involved in the endometrial cancer-signaling pathway (based on IPA knowledge database).
   Conclusion: The genes altered in endometrium displaying PAEC after 3 months of mifepristone exposure are mainly involved in the structural architecture of tissue.
   Implications: PAEC features may be explained by the altered genes and their networks affecting tissue architecture although not involved in endometrial cancer signaling pathways, and thus, treatment with mifepristone at this dosage does not show any adverse effect at endometrial level.

AB Objective(s): This study aimed to determine whether intrauterine placement of a novel composite material [copper (Cu) microparticles, low-density polyethylene, and methyl vinyl silicone rubber (Cu/LDPE/MVQ)] could prevent pregnancy in rabbits, and to evaluate the effects of Cu/LDPE/MVQ on the endometrial environment.
   Study Design: Eighty sexually mature female rabbits were randomly divided into four groups (n=20 each group): control (sham-operated), LDPE/MVQ Cu/LDPE/MVQ microcomposite, and bare Cu. Ten rabbits from each implant-bearing group were randomly selected for a mating experiment beginning 30 days after insertion. Pregnancy outcomes were observed 15 days after mating. Factors associated with endometrial bleeding and inflammation in the remaining rabbits in each group, and the surface conditions of the implants, were investigated 90 days post-insertion.
   Results: The Cu (0 embryo) and Cu/LDPE/MVQ (0 embryo) groups had significantly fewer embryos than the LDPE/MVQ (1.0 +/- 0.6 embryos, p<.05) and sham-operated groups (4.1 +/- 1.3 embryos, p<.05). Compared with bare Cu, the Cu/LDPE/MVQ composite material was associated with considerable reductions in injuries and factors associated with abnormal endometrial bleeding and inflammation, such as matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)). Additionally, the surface of implanted Cu/LDPE/MVQ remained much smoother than that of implanted bare Cu.
   Conclusion(s): This novel Cu-containing intrauterine device material exhibits a similar effect in prevention of pregnancy with bare copper, and lower levels of inflammatory markers.
   Implications: This study demonstrates the potential of the novel Cu/LDPE/MVQ microcomposite material as a future substitute for conventional intrauterine device materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Water quality in aguadas within a protected karstic rain forest: The
   role of the vegetation-soil-water interactions

AB Hydrological aspects in ecosystems are defined as those that support the availability of water. This involves the analysis of ecosystems establishing their ecological interactions as well as external factors such as humans' presence, changes in seasonal patterns of flow, physicochemical characteristics of water bodies, and the type and amount of pollutants entering these water bodies mostly due to surface but also some subsurface runoff. The aim of this article is to establish if soil type, vegetation or land use changes have a major impact affecting water quality in aguadas (a type of cenotes) and therefore its availability as a source of water in a rain forest ecosystem with karst soil and shortages. For this, nine aguadas were monitored in a Natural Protected area, whose importance is based on sustaining the ecosystem of different species, as well as to provide a source of water supply. The monitoring work considered soil and vegetation characteristics and water quality, in the aguadas, with and without direct human impact. Results showed that the studied sites at the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve (RBC) can be divided into three areas according to several factors some of them soil type, vegetation and climate. For each of the studies sites, sample tests of microorganisms, physico-chemical parameters and metals were performed. It was observed that deforestation around water bodies, transforming jungle into agricultural land, is critical since it creates a climatic transition zone affecting the water balance, and generates erosion moving nutrients and soil materials into water bodies. Additionally, the presence of total coliforms due to the combined use of water for human and animal use was observed. The natural influence by rock washing or erosion in the subsurface and surface has an effect on production systems due to the presence of carbonates, sodium, calcium, magnesium and potassium. Besides these elements, all aguadas also have high concentrations of: cadmium, manganese, cupper, iron, aluminium, barium and strontium but they are agreed with the Water Quality Criteria. La Ceiba aguada has some traces of arsenic 0.019 mg/L and vanadium 0.041 mg/L. The presence of these elements need to be specified (natural or anthropogenic causes) in order to propose a treatment process. Based on this, soil and vegetation are clue to define water quality in a natural reserve, thus it is necessary to reduce deforestation and recovering the capacity of the resilience through a sustainable forest management.

AB To reveal the performance of stem powder of Solidago canadensis as a putatively advantageous biosorbent for removal of Cd(II) from simulated waste water, the kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics of biosorption, the effects of ionic strength, humic acid and the physio-chemical factors on biosorption, as well as the desorption and regeneration processes were investigated comprehensively. The stem of S. canadensis was oven-dried and processed into fine powder then mixed with 5 mg/L, 10 mg/L or 20 mg/L Cd(II) solution. The residual concentration was measured using flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The reacting conditions were optimized to pH = 6.0 with a dosage of 0.5 g/L for contact of 240 min. The results showed that: the biosorption reaction is best described by Langmuir monolayer isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic models; thermodynamic analysis indicates an exothermic and entropy-decreasing biosorption process; at the optimal temperature 298 K, the saturated biosorption capacity was 19.34 mg/g, greater than that of rise husk and wheat straw reported literally; the increase of ionic strength was beneficial to the capacity of biosorption, for example 0.01 mmol/L and, 0.1 mmol/L Na+ increased the biosorption capacity from 17.58 mg/g to 19.03 mg/g and 19.50 mg/g; the presence of 20 mg/L Ca (II) Mg(II) or humic acid reduced the biosorption capacity by 62.2%, 44.0% and 51.9%, respectively; growing additional amounts of alkaline earth metal ions or humic acid increasingly reduce the biosorption capacity; using 0.01 mmol/L HCl as an agent to regenerate the Cd(II)-loaded biosorbent, the biosorption efficiency decreased to 69.11% of the first round biosorption after 4 cycles. Our results demonstrate that the stem powder of S. canadensis is a promising biomass-based biosorbent for the removal of Cd(II) from waste water for its fine capacity of biosorption and regeneration.

AB Soil and water come under the category of the most important renewable natural resources on earth. But due to their indiscriminate use, they can be seriously endangered. Hence it is essential to manage natural resources sustainably to preserve them for the future. For soil prevention, Morphometric analyses only drainage pattern. However, Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) and soil characteristics should also be considered. Thus, it is necessary to combine all methods of prioritization to provide reliable results. As the Ganga watershed in India is currently under environmental distress, therefore in the present study, Morphometric, land use/land cover and Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) analysis are done in this watershed using ArcGIS and ArcSWAT. To identify the erosion prone areas for effective planning and management of groundwater resources the study area was divided into seventeen sub-watersheds for the analysis. The mainstream of the basin is of eighth order, and drainage patterns of sub-basins are mostly of sub dendritic to dendritic. Various linear, areal and relief parameters of each sub-watersheds have been determined, and sub-watersheds are prioritized by ranking them according to erodibility characteristic. The results reveal that according to Morphometric analysis out of seventeen sub-watersheds, Rajpura Region, Narahi Region and Mughal Sarai Region Sub-watersheds are subjected to more soil erosion, and Sarai Meer Region, Balia Region and Ghazipur Region Sub-watersheds are subjected to least soil erosion. Whereas according to LULC and USLE analysis Narahi Region, Pipra Region, Gahmar Region Sub-watersheds and Rajpura Region and Mughal Sarai Region Sub-watersheds are likely to be subjected to more soil erosion respectively. Sarai Meer Region, Lalganj Region, Pindra Region Sub-watersheds and Sarai Meer Region, Lalganj Region, Magharia Region Sub-watersheds are subjected to least soil erosion according to LULC and USLE analysis respectively. Integrating all the three methods, we found that Chandauli Region, Narahi Region and Mirzapur Region Sub-watersheds are suffering from severe soil erosion problem and Sarai Meer Region, Lalganj Region and Ghazipur Region Sub-watersheds have least soil erosion. These results can be further used for soil erosion and sediment yield modeling projects.

AB The application of agricultural by-products as filter bed material for the treatment of oily wastewater is preferable due to their biodegradability and availability. The goal of this paper was to examine the sorption and filtration properties of sunflower (Lat. Helianthus annuus) fibres in a raw state. SEM imaging and nitrogen adsorption at -196.15 degrees C were applied to evaluate sorbent morphology. FTIR spectroscopy was used to determine the chemical composition of the pith. Studies on sorption in static conditions (pith fragmentation 1.5-4.0 mm) allowed process kinetics to be specified. The experimental kinetics was fitted to pseudo first-order and pseudo second-order kinetics by a non-linear method. To better predict kinetic parameters, a new modified logistic equation was proposed. Sunflower fibre was found to have high oil sorption capacity (12.67 g/g) and good retention properties.
   During filtration experiments, an artificial reservoir brine (0.1, 2.0, and 20.0 g/l of oil) was used as an oil-in-water emulsion; sunflower pith was used as a filter medium. The influence of four process parameters (pH, bed height, initial oil concentration, and flow rate) on removal efficiency was studied. Oil concentrations were determined by gas chromatography. The results demonstrated that the prepared filters operated better at a lower pH, lower flow, a deeper bed material, and higher concentration of inlet oil. The filtration efficiency for the removal of crude oil from oily brines reached more than 99% in the initial stage of the process. The results obtained suggest that natural plant fibres can be an effective bed material to separate oil from oily brine. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this research is to investigate the application of three different soil additives on existing selected draught resistant plants in 2016 and 2017 and how these can help improve soil conditions and the reduction of desalinated water for landscape irrigation in the UAE. The methodology of this Doctorate in Sustainable Built Environment (D.SBE) action research project, designed, developed and implemented by the first author, uses a mixed method. The case study is a 364 beds hospital located in Abu Dhabi, capital city of the UAE, with a vegetated open space and decorative water features representing more than 50% of the building footprint. The primary source of the medical facility landscape irrigation and water feature is designed to be air conditioning condensate water to avoid usage of any desalinated water in an arid environment. For four months of the year, the irrigation demand will not be met by the condensate water in winter because peak condensate formation occurs in summer. This shortfall availability during the winter months is proposed to be met by soil amendment and by use of other alternative water types. The soil test results show rapid plant growth with one of the soil conditioner solution whereas water savings is inconclusive due to irrigation system hydraulic irregularities and the lack of irrigation standardized rating for building operation. The next steps are to firstly balance the soil pH with a gypsum solution, to secondly reprogram the irrigation system controller with tested and audited hydraulic building parameters and to thirdly include all adequate parameters including ETo and rainfall to estimate the irrigation demand so that water savings can be accurately monitored. This intervention study will help understand the correlation between soil water quality together with irrigation rate and irrigation distribution system's audit and how these factors impact on the environment, operation and maintenance cost and practices, greenhouse gas emissions, and building systems water and energy consumption. The results may be relevant to local authorities responsible for making and adjusting standards for outdoor irrigation strategy for all types of building. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of nitrate treatment as a restoration method is to bring about a reduction of the high potential reactivity of sediments by the oxidation of biodegradable organic matter. As a consequence, oxygen uptake by sediments is reduced, sulphate reduction is lowered, hydrogen sulphide formation diminished and iron present in sediments binds phosphorus (P) effectively. This approach was applied in Uzarzewskie Lake, where innovative nitrate treatment of sediments was proposed through the diversion of subsurface waters to the lake hypolimnion. Nitrate-rich and oxygenated water from two tributaries was directly delivered to the hypolimnion through pipelines in order to increase redox potential and eliminate sediments as a P source. Research on selected physico-chemical and biological water characteristics was conducted in the years 2005-2015 to determine the results of restoration measures.
   P concentrations in lake waters were reduced both in surface water layers and the hypolimnion, hence epilimnetic chlorophyll-a content was diminished as well. Statistically significant changes in phytoplankton community structure were noted as the biomass of cyanobacteria had decreased in 2010 and 2013-2014 in comparison to 2006, while cryptophytes biomass increased in 2011-2013 in relation to 2007. Unfortunately, planktivorous fish domination in fish fauna exert a distinct pressure on zooplankton, thus Rotifera dominated and Cladocera were rarely noted. Additionally, the morphometric lake features (steep slopes, small surface surrounded by forest) create unfavorable conditions for submerged macrophyte development, and hinder the effectiveness of the restoration. Long-term studies revealed that the reconstruction of the phytoplankton community was not permanent, hence further restoration activity is required, with the inclusion of new techniques.

AB Current inorganic chemical-based fertilizers for soils have adverse impacts on human health and environment. In the present work, two nitrifying bacteria, i.e. Nitrosomonas sp. DSM 28437 and Nitrobacter sp. DSM 10236, were explored for the production of nitrate in vegetable wastes. For this purpose, the nitrite production by Nitrosomonas sp. and nitrate production by Nitrobacter sp. in two synthetic media containing ammonium and nitrite, respectively were investigated. Also, simultaneous growth of both bacteria in a single synthetic medium containing ammonium was investigated. Finally, the performance of both bacteria in a mixture of vegetable wastes, where a consortia of microorganisms present in cattle-based compost produced ammonium, were investigated. Highest concentration of nitrite (13.2 ppm) and nitrate (1600 ppm) in Nitrosomonas sp. and Nitrobacter sp. inoculated synthetic media were achieved after 12 and 28 days, respectively. The simultaneous growth of both bacteria in synthetic media and both bacteria along with compost microorganisms in vegetable wastes resulted in 12 and 20 ppm nitrate, respectively. Also, it was observed that with increasing time, the optical density of Nitrobacter sp. population increased from 0.04 to 0.72 after 35 days, but for Nitrosomonas sp., until 12 days, the optical density increased 0.3 from to 0.6 and then decreased to 0.2 on day 21 because of nitrite toxicity to the microorganism. The transformation of ammonium to nitrate using Nitrosomonas sp. and Nitrobacter sp. in synthetic media and a mixture of vegetable wastes was studied to develop a new organic fertilizer containing nitrogen source.
