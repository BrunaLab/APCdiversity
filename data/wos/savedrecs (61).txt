AB A step-wise, 'test-all-positive-gluten' analytical methodology has been developed and verified to assess kernel-based gluten contamination (i.e., wheat, barley and rye kernels) during gluten-free (GF) oat production. It targets GF claim compliance at the serving-size level (of a pouch or approximately 40-50 g). Oat groats are collected from GF oat production following a robust attribute-based sampling plan then split into 75-g sub-samples, and ground. R-Biopharm R5 sandwich ELISA R7001 is used for analysis of all the first 15-g portions of the ground sample. A > 20-ppm result disqualifies the production lot, while a > 5 to < 20-ppm result triggers complete analysis of the remaining 60-g of ground sample, analyzed in 15-g portions. If all five 15-g test results are < 20 ppm, and their average is < 10.67 ppm (since a 20-ppm contaminant in 40 g of oats would dilute to 10.67 ppm in 75-g), the lot is passed.

AB Guabiroba fruit has been highlighted for its high phytochemical content, particularly of phenolic compounds. The stability, bioavailability, and bioactivity of these compounds can be enhanced by nanoencapsulation, to improve functionality. Poly(D, L-lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles containing phenolic extract of guabiroba (GPE) were synthesized by an adapted emulsion-evaporation method and their physico-chemical and functional properties were studied at two lactic to glycolic acid ratios (50:50 and 65:35). Higher (P < 0.05) or equivalent antioxidant capacity compared to free GPE were observed for GPE-loaded nanoparticles. Free extract and PLGA nanoparticles were effective inhibitors of Listeria innocua, with lower (P < 0.05) GPE concentrations required for inhibition when nanoencapsulated. Also, reduction of ROS generation in non-cancer cells was achieved with lower GPE concentrations (P < 0.05) after encapsulation. These results suggest that PLGA nanoparticles can be used as a delivery system for phenolic compounds at lower levels than originally required for enhanced functional properties.

AB Tomato fractions were subjected to pulsed electric fields treatment combined or not with heating. Results showed that pulsed electric fields and heating applied in combination or individually induced permeabilization of cell membranes in the tomato fractions. However, no changes in beta-carotene and lycopene bioaccessibility were found upon combined and individual pulsed electric fields and heating, except in the following cases: (i) in tissue, a significant decrease in lycopene bioaccessibility upon combined pulsed electric fields and heating and heating only was observed; (ii) in chromoplasts, both beta-carotene and lycopene bioaccessibility significantly decreased upon combined pulsed electric fields and heating and pulsed electric fields only. The reduction in carotenoids bioaccessibility was attributed to modification in chromoplasts membrane and carotenoids-protein complexes. Differences in the effects of pulsed electric fields on bioaccessibility among different tomato fractions were related to tomato structure complexity.

AB This study investigated the potential use of atmospheric pressure plasma (APP) treatment as a curing process for canned ground ham. APP treatment for 60 min while mixing increased the nitrite content in the meat batters from 0.64 to 60.50 mg kg(-1) while the pH and the total content of aerobic bacteria in the meat batters were unchanged. The canned ground hams cured by the APP treatment for 30 min displayed no difference in their physicochemical qualities, such as nitrosyl hemochrome, color, residual nitrite, texture, lipid oxidation, and protein oxidation, compared with those of canned ground hams cured with sodium nitrite or celery powder at 42 mg kg(-1) of nitrite. The canned ground hams cured by the APP treatment received a higher score in taste and overall acceptability than those cured with sodium nitrite. Canned ground ham can be cured by the APP treatment without nitrite additives.

AB In the palm oil industry, the deacidification process is performed by steam stripping which causes the loss of most of palm oil's natural antioxidants due to high temperature. The liquid-liquid extraction process which is carried out at low temperature is preferable in order to preserve these compounds. The use of hydrated ethanol can reduce the losses of antioxidants, but the ability of this solvent to extract free fatty acids also decreases. Betaine monohydrate-based natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) have extensive potential for this process. The selectivity of these NADES was determined to select a preferable solvent. The betaine monohydrate-glycerol NADES in a molar ratio of 1: 8 was determined to be the preferred solvent with the highest selectivity. This solvent has an efficiency of palmitic acid extraction of 34.14%, and the amount of antioxidants can be preserved in the refined palm oil up to 99%. The compounds are stable during extraction.

AB Seafood is highly perishable and has a short shelf-life. During storage many reactions occur leading to changes in quality such as endogenous chemical and enzymatic reactions. The safety and shelf-life are related to the presence of food spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms. Despite improved manufacturing facilities and implementation of effective process control procedures such as the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point system by seafood companies, the number of seafood-related foodborne illnesses has increased. Edible coatings can improve the quality of fresh and frozen products by retarding microbial growth, reducing lipid oxidation and moisture loss, and functioning as a carrier of food additives such as antimicrobial and antioxidant agents. Biodegradable edible coatings have various advantages over synthetic coatings such as being edible and generally being more environmentally friendly. This paper reviews the application of various types of natural bio-polymer and different active ingredients incorporated into the films and their effects on seafood quality attributes.

AB Proton high-resolution magic angle spinning (H-1 HR-MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in combination with principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to characterize dry-fermented sausages salchichcn type throughout the manufacturing process. H-1 HR-MAS NMR metabolite profiling was achieved from a small sample of intact sausage after 0, 2, 4, 7, 11 and 14 days of drying. Intriguingly, the obtained results enabled the identification of the three main stages in the traditional production of salchichcn. Formulation, fermentation and drying-ripening periods showed distinct and characteristic metabolomic profiles. Compositional changes related to microbial activity, as well as proteolytic and lipolytic phenomena, decisive steps in such a ripening process, could be monitored through the NMR spectra. This study shows the potential of H-1 HR-MAS as a rapid method for probing metabolomic profiles and compositional changes during sausages processing.

AB A novel polysaccharide AAMP-A70 (5.6 kDa) has been purified from the fruiting bodies of Amillariella mellea. Compositional analysis and 1H and 13C NMR spectra indicate that AAMP-A70 is a branched beta-glucan with a main chain that consists of beta-D-(1 -> 6) linked Glc rho residues substituted at O-3 by beta-Glc rho or alpha-D-(1 -> 6)-linked Gal rho side chains. AAMP-A70 increases macrophage phagocytosis and secretion of NO, ROS, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 beta. Mechanistically, AAMP-A70 promotes degradation of I kappa B-alpha and nuclear translocation of the NF-kappa B p65 subunit, and enhances phosphorylation of MAPKs. In particular, the function blocking antibody to TLR2 substantially suppresses TNF-a and IL-6 production. Our data demonstrate that AAMP-A70 activates macrophages via NF-kappa B/MAPK signaling pathways and the TLR2 receptor. Overall, AAMP-A70 may serve as a good food supplement to enhance immunity.

AB In this report, the amylose composition and molecular structure of starches from the core and outer pericarp of 3 golden kiwifruit varieties were characterised, using enzymatic and chromatographic techniques. Starches from the core tissues of kiwifruit tend to have higher amylose contents (by similar to 3-5%) and longer unit chains of both amylopectins and their phi, beta-limit dextrins (LDs) than those of the outer pericarp starches. The contents of short B-chains of the phi, beta-LDs of amylopectins from the outer pericarp were higher (by similar to 3%) than those of phi, beta-LDs of the core amylopectins. Overall, the composition and structure of starches from the outer pericarp and core tissues of a golden kiwifruit were different. This study provides a structural basis to further investigate the starch degradation in kiwifruit, which may be of importance for the storage and eating quality of the fruit. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nitrogen is an important element for grapevine and winemaking, which affects plant development, grape juice fermentation and has a potential effect in modulating wine quality. The aim was to study the influence of foliar applications of riboflavin (vitamin B2) to vineyard on grape nitrogen composition. This vitamin has a reported capacity to protect different plant species, but its application to favor grape and grape juice quality had not previously been studied. This work reports the oenological properties and the effect on amino acid concentration of grape juices obtained from grapes treated with riboflavin at two different doses compared to control. Results showed that probable alcohol, malic acid, color intensity and hue had significant differences when the riboflavin treatments were applied. Most of the amino acids presented the highest concentrations when the lowest riboflavin dose was used. These results are promising in terms of fermentation development and grape juice nitrogen composition.

AB Among many functional foods and their phytochemicals, ingestion of soybean (Glycine max) is highly correlated to reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases. Validation of potential health benefits of functional foods requires information about the bioavailability and metabolism of bioactive compounds. In this context, several phase I and II metabolites of isoflavones were target-analyzed in the plasma of rats acutely supplemented with soybean embryo extract. A daidzein metabolite, 7,8,4 '-trihydroxyisoflavone (7,8,4 '-THI), was found to have the highest average area under curve value (574.3 +/- 112.8). Therefore, its potential prevention effect on atherosclerosis was investigated using monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion assay. Different from its precursor daidzein or daidzin, 7,8,4 '-THI attenuated adhesion of THP-1 monocytes to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In addition, 7,8,4 '-THI significantly downregulated TNF-alpha stimulated the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and phosphorylation of I.B kinase and I.Ba involved in the initiation of atherosclerosis in HUVECs. Therefore, 7,8,4 '-THI, a highly bioavailable hydroxylated isoflavone metabolite, has potential anti-atherosclerotic effect via inhibiting monocyte-endothelial adhesion.

AB A QuEChERS based methodology was developed for the simultaneous identification and quantification of acetamiprid, imidacloprid, and spirotetramat and their relevant metabolites in pistachio by liquid chromato-graphy-tandem mass spectrometry for the first time. First, sample extraction was done with MeCN:citrate buffer: NaHCO3 followed by phase separation with the addition of MgSO4: NaCl. The supernatant was then cleaned by a primary-secondary amine (PSA), GCB, and MgSO4. The proposed method provides a linearity in the range of 5-200 mu g L-1, and the linear regression coefficients were higher than 0.99. LOD and LOQ were obtained to be 2 and 5 mu g kg(-1) for the studied insecticides, respectively, with the exception of imidacloprid-olefin (5 and 10 mu g kg(-1)). Acceptable recoveries (91-110%) were obtained for all the analytes with good intra-and interprecisions (0.4 >= RSD >= 11.0). The method was then used for the pistachio samples collected from a field trial to estimate the maximum residue limits (MRLs) in next step.

AB The antioxidative role of Hsp90 purified from duck muscle on phospholipid was investigated in this study. Lipid oxidation was assessed by ferric thiocyanate method, and particle size, zeta potential measurements and transmission electron microscopy were employed to detect physical and chemical changes during oxidation of liposomes. Increase of the peroxidation products, decrease of the particle size and disruption of the spherical unity of the liposomes were detected when liposome was exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) oxidation, and Hsp90 was shown to protect liposome against oxidation. To further test the protection of Hsp90 on cell membrane, the Hsp90 transformed E. coli cell model was built. The Hsp90-containing E. coli showed higher survival and better membrane integrity as compared to the control upon H2O2 exposure. It is expected that Hsp90 plays an important role in the prevention of phospholipids oxidation in meat and has potential use as a food antioxidant.

AB Marinated meat in soy sauce was produced using hind leg by washing, rubbing salt, marinating with soy sauce and spices, and air dry-ripening for 15 d. The effect of high pressure (HP) (150 and 300 MPa for 15 min) on the metabolite profiles of products was characterized using H-1 NMR and multivariate data analysis. The results showed that the metabonome was dominated by 26 metabolites, including amino acids, sugars, organic acids, nucleic aides and their derivatives. PC1 and PC2 explained a total of 75.4 and 11.9% of variables, respectively. HP treatments increased most of the metabolites, especially PC1, glutamate, sugars, nucleotides, anserine, lactate and creatine compared to the control. The increase of metabolites under HP was not dependent on pressure level except for alanine, lactate, acetate, formate, fumarate, glucose and 5'-IMP. These findings demonstrated that HP treatment at 150 MPa was economical to improve the taste of marinated meat in soy sauce.

AB Carotenoids are important phytonutrients responsible for the yellow endosperm color in cereal grains. Five carotenoids, namely lutein, zeaxanthin, antheraxanthin, a-and alpha-carotene, were quantified by HPLC-DAD-MS in fourteen genotypes of wheat, barley and tritordeum harvested in Czechia in 2014 and 2015. The highest carotenoid contents were found in yellow-grained tritordeum HT 439 (12.16 mu g/g DW), followed by blue-grained wheat V1-131-15 (7.46 mu g/g DW), and yellow-grained wheat TA 4024 (7.04 mu g/g DW). Comparing carotenoid contents, blue varieties had lower whereas purple ones had the same or higher levels than conventional bread wheat. Lutein was the main carotenoid found in wheat and tritordeum while zeaxanthin dominated in barley. The majority of cereals contained considerable levels of esterified forms (up to 61%) of which lutein esters prevailed. It was assessed that cereal genotype determines the proportion of free and esterified forms. High temperatures and drought during the growing season promoted carotenoid biosynthesis.

AB A novel, rapid, simultaneous analysis method for five sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose, maltose, and lactose) and eight sugar alcohols (erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol, inositol, maltitol, lactitol, and isomalt) was developed using UPLC-ELSD, without derivatization. The analysis conditions, including the gradient conditions, modifier concentration and column length, were optimized. Thirteen sugars and sugar alcohols were separated well and the resolution of their peaks was above 1.0. Their optimum analysis condition can be analyzed within 15 min. Standard curves for sugars and sugar alcohols with concentrations of 5.0-0.1% and 2.0-0.05% are presented herein, and their correlation coefficients are found to be above 0.999 and the limit of detection (LOD) was around 0.006-0.018%. This novel analysis system can be used for foodstuffs such as candy, chewing gum, jelly, chocolate, processed chocolate products, and snacks containing 0.21-46.41% of sugars and sugar alcohols.

AB Amino acids and volatile compounds play an important role in wine aroma and sensory characteristics. The concentrations of these compounds might be altered by climate interanual variability and by management practices such as irrigation. The aim of the current study was to assess the amino acid profile of musts and wines, volatile composition and sensory profile of wines from Vitis vinifera (L.) cultivar 'Treixadura' obtained from vines under rain-fed and irrigation conditions over three consecutive vintages (2012-2014). Musts and wines from the irrigation treatment tended to be higher in acidity than those from rain-fed. However, amino acid and aromatic profiles were mostly affected by climate conditions of each year; although irrigation exerted a significant effect on several compounds (proline, cysteine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, alpha-terpineol and geraniol). Wines from both treatments received similar marks in the sensory tests, suggesting that irrigation did not greatly modify wine quality under the conditions of this study.

AB Colored-grain spring and winter wheat, spring tritordeum and barley (blue aleurone, purple pericarp, and yellow endosperm) from the harvests 2014 and 2015 were evaluated for tocol contents by HPLC-FD. Higher content of total tocols was found in spring wheat varieties compared with winter varieties. Four tocols (beta-tocotrienol, alpha-tocotrienol, beta-tocopherol, and a-tocopherol) were identified in wheat and tritordeum varieties. Dominant tocols in purple-and blue-grained wheat and yellow-grained tritordeum were alpha-tocopherol and beta-tocotrienol, whereas spring barley varieties differed from wheat and tritordeum by high alpha-tocotrienol content. Tocol content was significantly affected by genotype and in a lesser extent in some varieties and lines also by rainfall and temperatures during crop year. Higher rainfall and lower temperatures caused in most varieties higher tocol contents. Purple-and blue-grained wheat lines with higher tocol, anthocyanin and phenolic acids with health benefits may be useful for breeding new varieties.

AB In this work, an enzymatic route for synthesizing phytosteryl lipoate was successfully set up for the first time. The structure of final product phytosteryl lipoate was determined by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Mass Spectrometry (MS) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The maximum conversion of 71.2% was achieved when the following conditions were employed: 150 mmol/L phytosterol, 1:2.5 M ratio of phytosterol to lipoic acid, 10 g/L of 4 angstrom molecular sieves and 60 g/L Candida rugosa in 2-methyl-2-butanol/n-hexane (1:1, v/v) at 55 degrees C for 96 h. The physicochemical properties including solubility and antioxidant ability of phytosteryl lipoate in oil were assessed. The results revealed that phytosteryl lipoate possessed over twice as much oil solubility as free phytosterol and also showed better antioxidant ability. Investigation on its biological functions will be the main object in the future work.

AB Mesoporous nanomaterials were used to prevent protein haze in Muscat Ottonel and Pedro Ximenez wines. Major volatile compounds, polyols and turbidity were analyzed in fined wines and the results were compared with untreated and fined with bentonite wines. Two commercial mesoporous nanomaterial labelled as SBA-15 and MCM - 41 provided a notable turbidity reduction and prevent protein haze as was demonstrated by the heat stability tests. Only, the siliceous material labelled as KIT-6 was not suitable for wine fining. All the chemical families were affected by the fining agents, although the loss of aroma compounds was lower with nanomaterials than with bentonite. The impact on volatile compounds concentration depends on tested wine, independently on the fining agent used. Wines were distinguished by principal components analysis, which was carried out using the volatile compounds as classifying variables. Wines treated with SBA-15 were closest to the control wine in terms of volatile compounds concentration.

AB Authentication of food or food supplements with medicinal values is important to avoid adverse toxic effects, provide consumer rights, as well as for certification purpose. Compared to morphological and spectrometric techniques, molecular authentication is found to be accurate, sensitive and reliable. However, DNA degradation and inclusion of inhibitors may lead to failure in PCR amplification. This paper reviews on the existing DNA extraction and PCR protocols, and the use of small size DNA markers with sufficient discriminative power for molecular authentication. Various emerging new molecular techniques such as isothermal amplification for on-site diagnosis, next-generation sequencing for high-throughput species identification, high resolution melting analysis for quick species differentiation, DNA array techniques for rapid detection and quantitative determination in food products are also discussed.

AB We developed a colorimetric sensor array (CSA) that is sensitive to highly contributory volatile compounds of coffee aroma for discrimination of coffee samples roasted to different roast degrees. Strecker aldehydes and alpha-diketones were significantly higher for the medium roast than the other roast degrees. The development of several sulfur compounds was pronounced in the medium-dark and dark roasts, except for dimethyl sulfide, which was only detected in the light roast. The CSA method coupled with principal component analysis or hierarchical cluster analysis successfully distinguished the roasted coffee samples according to roast degree. Partial least squares regression results showed that the CSA responses were well-correlated with the concentrations of volatile compounds in the coefficient of determination (r(p)(2)) range of 0.686-0.955. These results demonstrate that the CSA rapidly responded to coffee aroma compounds and was capable of predicting coffee aroma development.

AB Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the world's third largest food crop after wheat and corn. Geographic authentication of rice has recently emerged as an important issue for enhancing human health via food safety and quality assurance. Here, we aimed to discriminate rice of six Asian countries through geographic authentication using combinations of elemental/isotopic composition analysis and chemometric techniques. Principal components analysis could distinguish samples cultivated from most countries, except for those cultivated in the Philippines and Japan. Furthermore, orthogonal projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis provided clear discrimination between rice cultivated in Korea and other countries. The major common variables responsible for differentiation in these models were delta S-34, Mn, and Mg. Our findings contribute to understanding the variations of elemental and isotopic compositions in rice depending on geographic origins, and offer valuable insight into the control of fraudulent labeling regarding the geographic origins of rice traded among Asian countries.

AB To investigate the effect of preparation methods of cottonseed meals on protein properties, the physicochemical and functional properties of proteins isolated from hot-pressed solvent extraction cottonseed meal (HCM), cold-pressed solvent extraction cottonseed meal (CCM) and subcritical fluid extraction cottonseed meal (SCM) were investigated. Cottonseed proteins had two major bands (at about 45 and 50 kD), two X-ray diffraction peaks (8.5 degrees and 19.5 degrees) and one endothermic peak (94.31 degrees C-97.72 degrees C). Proteins of HCM showed relatively more beta-sheet (38.3%-40.5%), and less beta-turn (22.2%-25.8%) and alpha-helix (15.8%-19.5%), indicating the presence of highly denatured protein molecules. Proteins of CCM and SCM exhibited high water/oil absorption capacity, emulsifying abilities, surface hydrophobicity and fluorescence intensity, suggesting that the proteins have potential as functional ingredients in the food industry.

AB Effects of propyl gallate on metabolisms of respiration and energy of harvested 'Fuyan' longans and its relationship to pericarp browning were investigated. Compared to control longans, propyl gallate could reduce ascorbic acid oxidase (AAO) activity, lower cytochrome C oxidase (CCO) activity during early-storage and mid-storage, increase NADK activity, elevate contents of NADP and NADPH, decrease contents of NAD and NADH, in addition, lower the decreases of ATP content and energy charge (E.C.), increase activities of mitochondrial H+ -ATPase, Ca2+ -ATPase and Mg2+ -ATPase during early-storage and mid-storage. Above results suggested that propyl gallate-retarded browning development in pericarp of harvested longans was resulted from decreases in activities of respiratory terminal oxidases like CCO and AAO, increase in proportion of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to Embden-Meyerh of pathway (EMP) and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and maintenance of mitochondrial integrity via retaining higher levels of ATP content and energy charge, as well as higher activities of mitochondrial ATPase.

AB The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between the effect of regulated deficit irrigation, cluster, developmental stages and two seasons (autumn 2015 and spring 2016) on the commercial and functional quality (carotenoids and plenolics levels) in 'Lazarino' and 'Summerbrix' tomatoes. Autumn had a positive effect on the commercial quality, with larger fruits (22% in 'Summerbrix'; 26% in 'Lazarino') and higher soluble solids (16% in 'Summerbrix'; 12% in 'Lazarino'). Total carotenoids did not change significantly with irrigation and variety while total phenolics did with the cluster and season. In most cases, the main amounts of carotenoids and phenolic were found in the higher cluster and carotenoids in ripe fruit. Thus, irrigation of such varieties could be reduced drastically (ca. 80%) without affecting considerably the overall quality of their fruits (changes not greater than 30%).

AB The adsorption and desorption characteristics of seven macroporous resins on the antioxidants in soy sauce were investigated. SP-207 and SP-825 resins possessing good adsorption and desorption capacities were studied further. The pseudo-second-order kinetics and Langmuir isotherm models were demonstrated to be appropriate to describe the whole exothermic and physical adsorption processes of antioxidants onto resins. The 60% ethanol eluted fraction from soy sauce purified by SP-825 resin column possessed the strongest antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activities and contents of typical soy isoflavones, furanones, pyranones, and phenolic acids in soy sauce were determined. These compounds contributed to 50.02% of the total antioxidant activity of the SP-60% fraction. The key small molecule antioxidant compounds in soy sauce were identified as 4-ethylguaiacol, catechol, daidzein, and 4-ethylphenol by the antioxidants omission experiments. Additionally, the purified active fraction with high contents of antioxidants from soy sauce could be applied as bioactive ingredient in food industry.

AB Brown algae are rich in polyphenolic compounds, phlorotannins, which have been found to possess high in vitro antioxidant capacity, especially DPPH radical scavenging activity, due to the high number of hydroxyl groups. Whereas, the overall antioxidant capacity of brown algae extracts has been widely studied, the antioxidant capacity of individual phlorotannins has been rarely explored. The aim of this study was to determine the structure dependant antioxidant capacity of phlorotannins from Icelandic brown algae, Fucus vesiculosus. The antioxidant capacity of individual phlorotannins was determined by an on-line method using liquid chromatography and an electrochemical detector followed by quadrupole Time of Flight mass spectrometry (UHPLCDAD-ECD-QTOFMS). Tentative structural elucidation of 13 phlorotannin isomers from EAF was obtained by LCDAD-QTOFMS, ranging from 374 to 870 Da. On-line determination of antioxidant capacity of the individual phlorotannins generally showed that low molecular phlorotannins exhibited higher antioxidant capacity and that the capacity decreased with polymerisation.

AB The application of a high-voltage electrostatic field (HVEF) is a novel method for thawing. To determine the effects of HVEF thawing (voltage range: - 25 kV to 0 kV) on myofibrillar protein oxidation and/or denaturation and to provide a theoretical understanding of this process, pork tenderloin was thawed by traditional and HVEF methods. Based on the total sulfhydryl and carbonyl contents, further protein oxidation did not occur during HVEF thawing. It was proposed that the free radical-mediated oxidation of myofibrillar proteins was hindered by HVEF. The results of dynamic rheological analysis, protein aggregation and gel texture studies showed that HVEF thawing, especially-10 kV HVEF thawing, led to better indicators than those achieved under air thawing. A higher abundance of proteins extracted from - 10 kV HVEF-thawed samples compared with air-thawed samples was found. Finally, this study showed that thawing under-10 kV conditions did not affect the structure of myofibrillar proteins.

AB Phenolic compounds in oilseeds occur in the free, esterified and insoluble-bound forms and serve as natural antioxidants by preventing food oxidation as well as oxidative stress and various disorders in the body. In this work, free, esterified and insoluble-bound phenolics were extracted from defatted camelina and sophia seeds. Samples were evaluated for their total contents of phenolics (TPC), flavonoids (TFC) and proanthocyanidins (PC) as well as the antioxidant activity of their various phenolic fractions. Several in vitro methods, namely Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), reducing power (RP) and metal chelation activity were used for all fractions. High performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLCDAD-MS/MS) identified 29 phenolics belonging to phenolic acids and their derivatives, flavonoids and procyanidins in different fractions of camelina and sophia extracts. Esterified fraction was the predominant form of phenolics in both seeds. Thus, camelina and sophia seeds may serve as viable functional food ingredients with protective antioxidant potential.

AB This study examined, for the first time, the effect of mild or moderate intensity pulsed electric field (PEF) processing on cherries, in particular changes in physicochemical properties, release of anthocyanins and polyphenols, and the potential growth of lactic acid bacteria. Cherry samples were treated at a constant pulse frequency of 100 Hz and a constant pulse width of 20 mu s with different electric field strengths between 0.3 and 2.5 kV/cm. Titratable acidity and total soluble solids values of most PEF samples stored for 24 h significantly decreased compared to other samples. Stored samples also had increased cyanidin glucoside content. However, concentration of rutin, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and isorhamnetin rutinoside significantly decreased in samples stored for 24 h. In conclusion, sweet cherries were only influenced by storage after PEF processing. PEF processing did not affect the growth of probiotic bacteria.

AB Phytoferritin cage has a nano-sized cavity to encapsulate bioactive molecules. In this work, a novel approach is presented that guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) (2 mM) can expand the channel of apo-soybean seed ferritin (apoSSF) and promote the encapsulation of rutin molecules in apoSSF at pH 7.0 without the disassembly of the protein cage. Upon removal of GuHCl from SSF, a rutin encapsulation ratio of 10.1% was obtained; and the prepared rutin-loaded ferritin nanoparticles were homogeneously distributed, showing a shell-like morphology with a size of 12 nm. By virtue of this interesting method, core molecules can be encapsulated within the ferritin cage in a benign condition without extreme pH changes, which is beneficial for the stability and bioactivity of the pH-sensitive molecules in food encapsulation and delivery of functional molecules.

AB Spectral characteristics and heat stability (90 degrees C, 5 h) of six isolated, structurally related cyanidin-3-O-glycosides from black carrot were investigated in aqueous solutions (pH 3.6 and 4.6) supplemented with chlorogenic acid (molar anthocyanin: co-pigment ratios 1: 62.5-1: 250). Chlorogenic acid supplementation generally increased absorbance of non-acylated anthocyanins by up to 97.9 and 122.9% at pH 3.6 and 4.6, respectively, being mainly attributed to the formation of intermolecular anthocyanin: co-pigment complexes. The effect significantly decreased when the chain length of the 3-O-linked non-acylated anthocyanins was increased from mono-to di-to triglycosyl moieties, possibly due to steric interferences of bound sugars and co-pigments. Intermolecular copigmentation was investigated for the first time for feruloylated and sinapoylated cyanidin-3-O-triglycosides. They exhibited weaker effects (10.8-16.0%) at pH 4.6, and no spectral response was observed at pH 3.6. Chlorogenic acid addition evoked weak enhancement of thermal pigment stability at pH 3.6, while it was highly detrimental for all anthocyanins at pH 4.6.

AB Metal-rich thermal-solid enzymatic processing of rice combined with yeast fermentation was investigated. 8 Metal ions were exogenously supplied at 0.05, 0.5 and 5 mmol/100 g (MG) rice prior to static high pressure enzymatic cooking (HPEC) and dynamic enzymatic extrusion cooking (EEC). Treated rice and its fermentation efficiency (FE) were characterized by rapid viscosity analyzer (RVA), UV-Vis, FT-IR and atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS). The optimum pH range of enzyme in solid system (> 4.9) was broader than in a liquid system (> 5.5). Cations decreased enzymatic activity in HPEC probably due to metal-induced aggregation of rice matrix with reduced reacting area as well as strengthened structure of starch/polysaccharides modified by metals. While using the EEC with mechanical mixing/shearing, relative activity was activated to 110 and 120% by Mg2+ (0.05-0.5 MG) and Ca2+ (0.05-5 MG), respectively. Furthermore, the effectiveness of residual ions to promote further FE was found to follow the order: Ca2+ > K+ > Zn2+ > Mg2+ > Mn2+ > Na+ approximate to Control > Fe2+ > Cu2+, individually.

AB The physicochemical and functional properties of tree peony seed protein were investigated. Tree peony seed protein with a favourable amino acid profile was composed of a 60 kDa protein with two subunits of 38 and 23 kDa. The isoelectric points of the two subunits were 3.6 and 9.0. Moreover, acid- Schiff staining indicated both of them were glycoproteins. Diagonal and 2-D electrophoresis data indicated the 38 kDa subunit included three types, which two types had inter-disulphide bonds and one type had no-disulphide bonds. So did the 23 kDa subunit. Circular dichroism spectra indicated the tree peony seed protein had predominantly a beta-sheet structure. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis indicated the denaturation temperatures of the tree peony seed protein at pH 5.0, 7.0 and 9.0 were 92.0, 97.1 and 95.2 degrees C, respectively. Tree peony seed protein could be a food ingredient in the food industry due to its desirable physicochemical and functional properties.

AB This study describes an optimisation and validation process using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to quantify acrylamide in foods mainly consumed by infants and toddlers. A limit of quantification of 5 mu g.kg(-1) for both solid and liquid samples was achieved, except for unprepared infant cereals (LOQ of 18 mu g.kg(-1)). The method was then applied to 141 food samples from the first French total diet study on infants and toddlers. Acrylamide was detected in most samples at mean LB/UB concentrations ranging from 0.14 to 102 mu g.kg(-1). The "Follow-on formula" and "Infant formula" products contained the lowest average content (LB/UB of 0.14/2.2 mu g. kg(-1) and 0.60/2.9 mu g. kg(-1) respectively) and the "Sweet and savoury biscuits and bars" (102 mu g. kg(-1); n = 1 represented by a plain dry biscuit) contained the highest.

AB This study provides the first investigation of the physical traits, pasting properties and volatile compounds of Cambodian rice cultivars, including traditional, improved, and improved traditional varieties, allowing for their differentiation as high and low quality rice. Analysis of the grain quality traits illustrates interesting features of traditional varieties and correlations between traits that assist with understanding texture. Untargeted profiling of volatile compounds shows that high quality fragrant varieties not only contain 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline but also several other compounds, including aldehydes, alcohols and 2-alkylfurans that contribute to overall aroma. Moreover, low odour threshold volatile compounds, which can be derived from the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, were more abundant in the fragrant varieties. The percentage area of both oleic and linoleic acid were found to be significantly different among the rice varieties tested. Such findings suggest that unsaturated fatty acids in milled rice contribute to rice fragrance, and thereby to overall quality.

AB Encapsulation of lipophilic bioactive compounds using plant-derived proteins as delivery systems has received increasing interest. In this study, proso millet protein was extracted by either wet milling or 60% (v/v) aqueous ethanol and then used as the wall material to encapsulate curcumin. Millet protein was composed of prolamines that showed a significant difference in surface hydrophobicity depending on extraction procedure. The millet protein-curcumin nanoparticles were spherical with diameter around 250-350 nm. The entrapment efficiency ranged from 11.2% to 78.9%, with millet protein extracted by ethanol showing better performance than that by wet milling process. The encapsulated curcumin exhibited a lower degradation rate than free curcumin at 60 degrees C. The encapsulation showed no negative effect on the antioxidant activity of curcumin as assessed by the DPPH and ABTS assays. These results suggested that MP could be a promising encapsulant for the delivery of lipophilic compounds.

AB Two QuEChERS-based methods were developed and validated, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric detection, in order to accurately determine residues of imidacloprid and oxamyl in green beans and chili peppers after treatment via irrigation system under field conditions in Egyptian farms. The validation included experiments for specificity, linearity, trueness, precision, matrix effect and limits of detection and quantification according to European Commission standards. The dissipation rates of both pesticides in green beans and chili peppers were studied and the pre-harvest intervals (PHIs) were calculated. The LOQ values of imidacloprid were 0.47 and 2.6 mu g/kg in green beans and chili peppers, respectively, while for oxamyl the LOQs were 2.9 and 0.67 mu g/kg, respectively. No PHI of imidacloprid is required, while for oxamyl it was found that still after 21 days, its residues' concentration on both crops was significantly higher than the maximum residue limit.

AB The present study explored the potential of ternary aggregates composed of lactoferrin (LF), high methylated pectin (HMP) and EGCG in stabilizing beta-carotene emulsions. Different ternary aggregates were fabricated by mixing the three components in different sequences, followed by spray drying. Fluorescence measurement and FTIR analysis indicated that ternary aggregates and LF-HMP binary complex were formed mainly through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. The mixing sequences of three components and the spray drying process resulted in different structures of ternary aggregates. When applied to stabilizing beta-carotene emulsions, ternary aggregates were effective in retarding droplet aggregation and creaming, and protecting beta-carotene from degradation, compared to the binary complexes of LF, HMP or EGCG. The least loss of beta-carotene was observed in the emulsions stabilized by spray-dried ternary aggregates. The conclusion obtained from the present study would be useful in the development of novel delivery systems for bioactive compounds.

AB In this study, 111 phenolic acids and their derivatives were chosen to investigate their structure-affinity relationships when binding to human serum albumin (HSA), and effects on their antioxidant activity. A comprehensive mathematical model was employed to calculate the binding constants, using a fluorescence quenching method, and this was corrected for the inner-filter effect to improve accuracy. We found that a hydroxy group at the 2-position of the benzene ring exerted a positive effect on the affinities, while a 4-hydroxy substituent had a negative influence. Both methylation of the hydroxy groups and replacing the hydroxy groups with methyl groups at the 3- and 4-positions of the benzene ring enhanced the binding affinities. Hydrophobic force and hydrogen bonding were binding forces for the phenolic acids, and their methyl esters, respectively. The antioxidant activity of the HSA-phenolic acid interaction compounds was higher than that of the phenolic acids alone.

AB The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of the different methods of preparation of the blue honeysuckle (Lonicera caerulea L. var. Kamtschatica) cv. 'Wojtek' and their influence on the iridoid content of fruit juices and fresh and freeze-dried pomaces. Compounds were identified by UPLC-ESI-qTOF-MS/MS in negative ion mode. Five iridoids - loganic acid, 7-epi-loganic acid 7-O-pentoside, loganin, sweroside, and secologanin - were determined in blue honeysuckle fruits and products. The results revealed no differences in iridoid content between the fresh pomace from skin and flesh, or between the juice from skin and flesh. A higher content of iridoids was obtained in juice from crushed than from whole berries, and in freeze-dried pomace from whole than from crushed berries. Freeze-dried pomace from blue honeysuckle can be an excellent source of bioactive iridoids.

AB Composition and changes in free volatiles have been extensively studied in citrus fruit such as mandarin. However, components of glycosidically bound volatiles and changes during fruit ripening have been rarely investigated. A total of 56 glycosidically-bound volatiles were identified in fruit peel at four ripening stages. The highest concentrations in glycosidically-bound volatiles were observed for methyl salicylate in ripening fruit. Concentration of total bound volatiles increased from color conversion stage at 150 days after bloom (DAB), peaked at yellow stage (190DAB), followed by a decrease at orange stage (210DAB). Satsuma mandarin fruit at different ripening stages could be separated in a partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) plot using glycosidically bound volatiles as variables. In total 35 glycosidically bound volatiles were identified with variable importance in projection (VIP) score exceeding 1, which may be potential markers for separating fruit at different ripening stages.

AB The present study was attempted to determine organoleptically acceptable concentration of betel leaf essential oil (BLEO) in raw apple juice using fuzzy logic approach, and to evaluate the efficacy of the acceptable concentration in the juice under refrigerated storage. The presence of BLEO components in treated juice was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. Based on similarity values, the acceptable concentration in the juice was found to be 0.19 mu l/ml of BLEO. Total antioxidant capacity of untreated juice was found to be 16% less than treated juice at the end of storage. The treated juice exceeded total aerobic plate count of 2 log(10) (cfu/ml) on 15th day of storage. Based on safe limits of microbial load, the shelf life of treated juice was extended by 6 days as compared to untreated juice under refrigerated storage. BLEO contributes to green consumerism and its application as food preservative will add value to the product.

AB Refined wheat flour and hulless barley bran (from 9 different cultivars) were blended to create nine composite flours and their functionality compared with a control wheat flour. Mixolab studies revealed that replacing wheat bran with barley bran increased dough water absorption up to 71.5% and consistency at peak during heating up to 2.11 Nm, and reduced starch retrogradation by 26.44%. The composite flours contained up to three-times more beta-glucan and significantly more total phenolics including flavonoids. Chapattis prepared from the composite blends had significantly more slowly digestible and resistant starches. Incorporating barley bran lowered starch retrogradation, based on more soluble starch and soluble amylose, and the starch retrogradation index correlated positively with decreases in soluble starch and soluble amylose. Total beta-glucan correlated negatively (r = -0.846, p < 0.05) with starch retrogradation index, indicating that beta-glucan is associated with starch retrogradation.

AB The volatile profile of crushed rocket leaves (Eruca sativa and Diplotaxis tenuifolia) was investigated by applying Headspace Solid-Phase MicroExtraction (HS-SPME), combined with GC-MS, to an aqueous extract obtained by homogenization of rocket leaves, and stabilized by addition of CaCl2. A detailed picture of volatile products of the lipoxygenase pathway (mainly C6-aldehydes) and of glucosinolate hydrolysis (mainly isothiocyanates), and their dynamics of formation after tissue disruption was given. Odor-active compounds of leaves were characterized by GC-Olfactometry (GC-O) and Aroma Extract Dilution Analysis (AEDA): volatile isolates obtained by HS-SPME from an aqueous extract and by Stir-Bar Sorptive Extraction (SBSE) from an ethanolic extract were analyzed. The most potent odor-active compounds fully or tentatively identified were (Z)-and (E)-3-hexenal, (Z)1,5- octadien-3-one, responsible for green olfactory notes, along with 4-mercaptobutyl and 4-(methylthio) butyl isothiocyanate, associated with typical rocket and radish aroma. Relatively high odor potency was observed for 1-octen-3-one, (E)-2-octenal and 1-penten-3-one.

AB Nuts, a class of fatty natural food, are associated with a series of health benefit. Lipid, which is the most abundant nutrient in nuts, could be one of the major contributors to many beneficial effects. In previous studies, only the composition of fatty acids was investigated. To better understand the nutritional value of nuts, phospholipids (PLs), with widely confirmed bioactivities, should be profiled as well. In this work, a HILIC-ESI-IT-TOFMS system is applied to characterize PL profiles in six kinds of nut, including almonds, cashews, pecans, pistachios, walnuts and peanuts. A total of 165 PL molecular species were characterized and quantified. The obtained results showed that pistachios, cashews and walnuts are favorable nuts with diverse and high content of PLs; peanuts consist of abundant PL species but lower concentration of PLs; almonds and pecans might not be the first choice for PLs with relatively low species abundance and content.

AB Raw peanuts in the USA are subjected to thermal processing, such as dry-roasting, prior to consumption. A multi-instrument metabolomics-based platform along with targeted analyses was used to determine changes in the low-molecular-weight compound composition of peanuts due to dry-roasting. Runner and virginia-type peanut seeds were characterized using several analytical platforms including (RP)/UPLC-MS/MS (positive and negative ion mode ESI) and HILIC/UPLC-MS/MS with negative ion mode ESI. Of the 383 compounds identified, 16 compounds were unique to the roasted peanuts. Using pathway analysis, compounds associated with arginine and proline metabolism were found to be the most changed. Products of chemical degradation and compounds contained within the vesicular bodies of the peanut increased after roasting. Dry-roasting had a significant impact on the levels and types of low-molecular-weight compounds present. These findings provide useful information about composition changes due to roasting.

AB In this study, aroma compounds produced by three marine microalgae species (Crypthecodinium cohnii, Schizochytrium limacinum and Tetraselmis chuii) and two fresh water microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris and Chlorella protothecoides) important for nutritional applications were identified by means of solid-phase microextraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), GC-olfactometry (GCO) and a sensory panel. Principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to the instrumental and sensory analysis data to visualize differences between the samples in terms of descriptive attributes and volatile compounds. Accordingly, C. cohnii was characterised by a high level of sulfur compounds (dimethyl sulfide, ethanethiol), and ester and alcohol compounds associated with distinct 'sulfur-cabbage', 'fruity', 'rosy', and 'boiled potato' aroma notes. While S. limacinum was characterised more by aldehydes and alcohol compounds associated with 'mushroom', 'cucumber', and 'fatty-grassy' aroma characteristics, the other three samples showed relatively higher levels of ketone and terpene compounds with 'woody' and 'cereal-like' sensory characteristics.

AB A novel method for simultaneous determination of pyrethroids residues in Litchi fruit has been developed by HPLC-UV detection using microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) coupled with ultrasonic-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (UADLLME). Extraction conditions of MAE and UADLLME were respectively investigated by single-factor experiments and response surface methodology. Optimized experimental conditions included 310 mu L of chlorobenzene as extraction solvent, 1.3 mL of ethanol as dispersive solvent and 3 min of extraction time for UADLLME. In the case of MAE, extraction temperature of 70 degrees C, extraction time of 4 min and solvent-to-materials ratio of 40: 1 were adopted. Results demonstrated that the proposed method had good performance with linearity of 0.0050-4.98 mg/L, recovery of 83.3-91.5%, RSDs below 5.6% and detection limit (LOD) of 1.15-2.46 mu g/L for six pyrethroids, offering higher extraction efficiency and larger enrichment factor. MAE-UADLLME provided a sensitive and efficient alternative to determination of trace amounts of pesticides residues in food samples.

AB In this work, a highly selective molecular imprinted polymer (SBA-15@MIP) was prepared using dicyandiamide (DCD) as the template molecule and mesoporous silica SBA-15 as the carrier. The resulting polymers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and FT-IR spectra. A highly ordered mesoporous nanostructure was observed for the fabricated polymer. The performance tests showed that the adsorption capacity of SBA-15@MIP for DCD was higher than those of non-imprinted mesoporous silica polymer (SBA-15@NIP) and SBA-15. SBA-15@MIP was successfully used as the solid-phase extraction (SPE) sorbent coupled with HPLC for trace DCD determination in bovine milk and milk powder. Under selected conditions, a favorable linearity between 1 mu g/mL and 100 mu g/mL was obtained and the detection limit was estimated to be 0.08 mu g/mL (bovine milk) and 0.10 mu g/mL (milk powder). These results indicated that SBA-15@MIP could be used as an efficient SPE adsorbent for enrichment of DCD in bovine milk and milk powder.

AB This paper presents the first report of sauropod tracks from the Upper Jurassic of Shanxi Province, China. Dinosaur tracks appear concentrated in five trackways, in different stratigraphic levels of the Late Jurassic Tianchihe Formation. Tracks are dominantly small and medium-size sauropod tracks and are tentatively assigned to Brontopodus based on preserved track morphology, trackway pattern and statistical analysis. The Tianchihe Formation in which the tracks appear shows a gradual change from meandering fluvial to sandy braided fluvial depositional systems developed in a seasonally arid environment. Comparisons of the evaluated speed of bipedal to quadruped trackways indicate that the slower walk more easily produces pes-dominated overprints. Trackways in the Guxian tracksite appear following different orientations, suggesting that these trackways were produced by different sauropods at different times. An unusual trackway following a curved pattern has been identified in the site and could represent a special locomotion character or a social behavior. The presence of eolian deposits in central Shanxi Province could have acted as a paleogeographic and paleoenvironmental barrier for the dispersion of the Yanliao Biota that survived in northern Hebei-westem Liaoning and northestern Shanxi Province to the Ordos Basin during the Late Jurassic.

ID INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS DEFINITIONS; HEALTH RECORD; MORTALITY
AB The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) in healthcare has provided vast new amounts of data for statistical machine learning researchers in their efforts to model and predict patient health status, potentially enabling novel advances in treatment. In the case of sepsis, a debilitating, dysregulated host response to infection, extracting subtle, uncataloged clinical phenotypes from the EMR with statistical machine learning methods has the potential to impact patient diagnosis and treatment early in the course of their hospitalization. However, there are significant barriers that must be overcome to extract these insights from EMR data. First, EMR datasets consist of both static and dynamic observations of discrete and continuous-valued variables, many of which may be missing, precluding the application of standard multivariate analysis techniques. Second, clinical populations observed via EMRs and relevant to the study and management of conditions like sepsis are often heterogeneous; properly accounting for this heterogeneity is critical. Here, we describe an unsupervised, probabilistic framework called a composite mixture model that can simultaneously accommodate the wide variety of observations frequently observed in EMR datasets, characterize heterogeneous clinical populations, and handle missing observations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a large-scale sepsis cohort, developing novel techniques built on our model-based clusters to track patient mortality risk over time and identify physiological trends and distinct subgroups of the dataset associated with elevated risk of mortality during hospitalization.

AB Numerical schemes to simulate the deformation of vesicles membranes via minimizing the bending energy have been widely studied in recent times due to its connection with many biological motivated problems. In this work we propose a new unconditionally energy stable numerical scheme for a vesicle membrane model that satisfies exactly the conservation of volume constraint and penalizes the surface area constraint. Moreover, we extend these ideas to present an unconditionally energy stable splitting scheme decoupling the interaction of the vesicle with a surrounding fluid. Finally, the well behavior of the proposed schemes are illustrated through several computational experiments. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme with suitable quadrature rules [15] for ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations on structural meshes. The semi-discrete scheme is analyzed to be entropy stable by using the symmetrizable version of the equations as introduced by Godunov [32], the entropy stable DG framework with suitable quadrature rules [15], the entropy conservative flux in [14] inside each cell and the entropy dissipative approximate Godunov type numerical flux at cell interfaces to make the scheme entropy stable. The main difficulty in the generalization of the results in [15] is the appearance of the non-conservative "source terms" added in the modified MHD model introduced by Godunov [32], which do not exist in the general hyperbolic system studied in [15]. Special care must be taken to discretize these "source terms" adequately so that the resulting DG scheme satisfies entropy stability. Total variation diminishing / bounded (TVD/TVB) limiters and bound-preserving limiters are applied to control spurious oscillations. We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of this new scheme on standard MHD examples. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The impetus of this research is to present a generalized Bernoulli Trial collision scheme in the context of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. Previously, a subsequent of several collision schemes have been put forward, which were mathematically based on the Kac stochastic model. These include Bernoulli Trial (BT), Ballot Box (BB), Simplified Bernoulli Trial (SBT) and Intelligent Simplified Bernoulli Trial (ISBT) schemes. The number of considered pairs for a possible collision in the above-mentioned schemes varies between N-(l)(N-(l) - 1)/2in BT, 1 in BB, and (N-(l) - 1) in SBT or ISBT, where N-(l) is the instantaneous number of particles in the lthcell. Here, we derive a generalized form of the Bernoulli Trial collision scheme (GBT) where the number of selected pairs is any desired value smaller than (N-(l) - 1), i.e., N-sel < (N-(l) - 1), keeping the same the collision frequency and accuracy of the solution as the original SBT and BT models. We derive two distinct formulas for the GBT scheme, where both formula recover BB and SBT limits if N-sel is set as 1 and N-(l) - 1, respectively, and provide accurate solutions for a wide set of test cases. The present generalization further improves the computational efficiency of the BT-based collision models compared to the standard no time counter (NTC) and nearest neighbor (NN) collision models.

AB The Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) scheme has served the computational electrodynamics community very well and part of its success stems from its ability to satisfy the constraints in Maxwell's equations. Even so, in the previous paper of this series we were able to present a second order accurate Godunov scheme for computational electrodynamics (CED) which satisfied all the same constraints and simultaneously retained all the traditional advantages of Godunov schemes. In this paper we extend the Finite Volume Time Domain (FVTD) schemes for CED in material media to better than second order of accuracy.
   From the FDTD method, we retain a somewhat modified staggering strategy of primal variables which enables a very beneficial constraint-preservation for the electric displacement and magnetic induction vector fields. This is accomplished with constraintpreserving reconstruction methods which are extended in this paper to third and fourth orders of accuracy. The idea of one-dimensional upwinding from Godunov schemes has to be significantly modified to use the multidimensionally upwinded Riemann solvers developed by the first author. In this paper, we show how they can be used within the context of a higher order scheme for CED.
   We also report on advances in timestepping. We show how Runge-Kutta IMEX schemes can be adapted to CED even in the presence of stiff source terms brought on by large conductivities as well as strong spatial variations in permittivity and permeability. We also formulate very efficient ADER timestepping strategies to endow our method with sub-cell resolving capabilities. As a result, our method can be stiffly-stable and resolve significant sub-cell variation in the material properties within a zone. Moreover, we present ADER schemes that are applicable to all hyperbolic PDEs with stiff source terms and at all orders of accuracy. Our new ADER formulation offers a treatment of stiff source terms that is much more efficient than previous ADER schemes. The computer algebra system scripts for generating ADER time update schemes for any general PDE with stiff source terms are also given in the electronic supplements to this paper.
   Second, third and fourth order accurate schemes for numerically solving Maxwell's equations in material media are presented in this paper. Several stringent tests are also presented to show that the method works and meets its design goals even when material permittivity and permeability vary by an order of magnitude over just a few zones. Furthermore, since the method is unconditionally stable and sub-cell-resolving in the presence of stiff source terms (i.e. for problems involving giant variations in conductivity over just a few zones), it can accurately handle such problems without any reduction in timestep. We also show that increasing the order of accuracy offers distinct advantages for resolving sub-cell variations in material properties. Most importantly, we show that when the accuracy requirements are stringent the higher order schemes offer the shortest time to solution. This makes a compelling case for the use of higher order, sub-cell resolving schemes in CED. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Cave dripwater chemistry of Oregon Caves National Monument (OCNM) was studied, where the parameters pH, total alkalinity, calcium, magnesium, strontium, sodium and barium were analyzed at quasi monthly intervals from 2005 to 2007. Different statistical analyses have been used to investigate the variability of the chemical parameters in the different sites in the OCNM cave system. The dripwater varies in response to seasonal changes in rainfall. The drip rates range from zero in summer to continuous flow in winter, closely following the rainfall intensity. Spatial variations of dripwater chemistry, which is nonlin-early related to dripwater discharge likely, reflect the chemical composition of bedrock and overlying soil, and the residence time of the ground water within the aquifer. The residence time of infiltrated water in bedrock cracks control the dissolution carbonate bedrock, reprecipitation of calcium carbonate and the degree of saturation of dripwater with respect to calcium carbonate minerals. Spatiotemporal fluctuations of dripwater Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios are controlled by dissolution of carbonate bedrock and the degree of calcite reprecipitation in bedrock cracks. This suggests that trace elements in speleothem deposits at the OCNM may serve as paleoclimatological proxies for precipitation, if interpreted within the context of understanding local bedrock chemistry.

AB A framework methodology is proposed for streamflow prediction in poorly-gauged rivers located within large-scale regions of sparse hydrometeorologic observation. A multi-criteria model evaluation is developed to select models that balance runoff efficiency with selection of accurate parameter values. Sparse observed data are supplemented by uncertain or low-resolution information, incorporated as 'soft' data, to estimate parameter values a priori. Model performance is tested in two catchments within a data-poor region of southwestern China, and results are compared to models selected using alternative calibration methods. While all models perform consistently with respect to runoff efficiency (NSE range of 0.67-0.78), models selected using the proposed multi-objective method may incorporate more representative parameter values than those selected by traditional calibration. Notably, parameter values estimated by the proposed method resonate with direct estimates of catchment subsurface storage capacity (parameter residuals of 20 and 61 mm for maximum soil moisture capacity (C-max), and 0.91 and 0.48 for soil moisture distribution shape factor (B); where a parameter residual is equal to the centroid of a soft parameter value minus the calibrated parameter value). A model more traditionally calibrated to observed data only (single-objective model) estimates a much lower soil moisture capacity (residuals of C-max = 475 and 518 mm and B = 1.24 and 0.7). A constrained single-objective model also underestimates maximum soil moisture capacity relative to a priori estimates (residuals of C-max = 246 and 289 mm). The proposed method may allow managers to more confidently transfer calibrated models to ungauged catchments for stream flow predictions, even in the world's most data-limited regions.

AB Precipitation plays an important role in both environment and human society and is a significant factor in many scientific researches such as water resources, agriculture and climate impact studies. The onset and retreat of rainy season are useful features to understand the variability of precipitation under the influence of climate change. In this study, the characteristics of onset and retreat in mainland China are investigated. The multi-scale moving t-test was applied to determine rainy season and K-means cluster analysis was used to divide China into sub-regions to better investigate rainy season features. The possible linkage of changing characteristics of onset and retreat to climate factors were also explored. Results show that: (1) the onset started from middle March in the southeast of China to early June in the northwest and rainy season ended earliest in the northwest and southeast while the central China had the latest retreat; (2) Delayed onset and advanced retreat over time were observed in many parts of China, together with overall stable or increased rainy-season precipitation, would likely lead to higher probability of flooding; (3) The onset (retreat) was associated with the increased (decreased) number of cyclones in eastern China and anticyclone near the South China Sea. Delayed onset, and advanced retreat were likely related to cold and warm sea surface temperature (SST) in the conventional El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) regions, respectively. These results suggest that predictability of rainy season can be improved through the atmospheric circulation and SST, and help water resources management and agricultural planning.

AB Indirect measurements of field-scale (hectometer grid-size) spatial-average near-surface soil moisture are becoming increasingly available by exploiting new-generation ground-based and satellite sensors. Nonetheless, modeling applications for water resources management require knowledge of plot-scale (1-5 m grid-size) soil moisture by using measurements through spatially-distributed sensor network systems. Since efforts to fulfill such requirements are not always possible due to time and budget constraints, alternative approaches are desirable. In this study, we explore the feasibility of determining spatial-average soil moisture and soil moisture patterns given the knowledge of long-term records of climate forcing data and topographic attributes. A downscaling approach is proposed that couples two different models: the Eco-Hydrological Bucket and Equilibrium Moisture from Topography. This approach helps identify the relative importance of two compound topographic indexes in explaining the spatial variation of soil moisture patterns, indicating valley- and hillslope-dependence controlled by lateral flow and radiative processes, respectively. The integrated model also detects temporal instability if the dominant type of topographic dependence changes with spatial-average soil moisture. Model application was carried out at three sites in different parts of Italy, each characterized by different environmental conditions. Prior calibration was performed by using sparse and sporadic soil moisture values measured by portable time domain reflectometry devices. Cross-site comparisons offer different interpretations in the explained spatial variation of soil moisture patterns, with time-invariant valley-dependence (site in northern Italy) and hillslope-dependence (site in southern Italy). The sources of soil moisture spatial variation at the site in central Italy are time-variant within the year and the seasonal change of topographic dependence can be conveniently correlated to a climate indicator such as the aridity index.

AB The Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) is a region of utmost importance to Vietnam's national food security. However, the availability of required freshwater resources (from both surface and groundwater sources) is currently under great threats due to dry season salinity intrusion, surface water pollution, and over-exploitation of groundwater. Global climate change, sea level rise, and upstream and in situ development activities may worsen the situation. Assuming that adaptive management could be a promising strategy to address the increasingly complex and unpredictable water-related problems in the VMD, we design and apply a framework to identify the extent to which the governance regime in this region exhibits conditions that are likely to promote adaptive freshwater management. Using both primary and secondary data, our analysis reveals that the prospects for adaptive water management in the study area are limited since several conditions were not present. We observe among others limitations in vertical and horizontal integration and public participation, restraints in knowledge and information sharing, inadequate policy development and implementation, and insufficient diversification of financial resources. Following our findings, we conclude the paper with recommendations both for national, regional and local policy interventions and for future research. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing of mountain rivers are susceptible to climate change. Trends and variability in streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing in four mountain basins in the southern Tianshan were analyzed in this study. Streamflow trends were detected by Mann-Kendall tests and changes in snowmelt runoff timing were analyzed based on the winter/spring snowmelt runoff center time (WSCT). Pearson's correlation coefficient was further calculated to analyze the relationships between climate variables, streamflow and WSCT. Annual streamflow increased significantly in past decades in the southern Tianshan, especially in spring and winter months. However, the relations between streamflow and temperature/precipitation depend on the different streamflow generation processes. Annual precipitation plays a vital role in controlling recharge in the Toxkon basin, while the Kaidu and Huangshuigou basins are governed by both precipitation and temperature. Seasonally, temperature has a strong effect on streamflow in autumn and winter, while summer streamflow appears more sensitive to changes in precipitation. However, temperature is the dominant factor for streamflow in the glacierized Kunmalik basin at annual and seasonal scales. An uptrend in streamflow begins in the 1990s at both annual and seasonal scales, which is generally consistent with temperature and precipitation fluctuations. Average WSCT dates in the Kaidu and Huangshuigou basins are earlier than in the Toxkon and Kunmalik basins, and shifted towards earlier dates since the mid-1980s in all the basins. It is plausible that WSCT dates are more sensitive to warmer temperature in spring period compared to precipitation, except for the Huangshuigou basin. Taken together, these findings are useful for applications in flood risk regulation, future hydropower projects and integrated water resources management. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There are numerous hydrologic studies using satellite altimetry data from repeat-orbit missions such as Envisat or Jason over rivers. This study is one of the first examples for the combination of altimetry from drifting-ground track satellite missions, namely CryoSat-2, with a river model. CryoSat-2 SARIn Level 2 data is used to improve a 1D hydrodynamic model of the Brahmaputra River in South Asia, which is based on the Saint-Venant equations for unsteady flow and set up in the MIKE HYDRO River software. After calibration of discharge and water level the hydrodynamic model can accurately and bias-free represent the spatio-temporal variations of water levels. A data assimilation framework has been developed and linked with the model. It is a flexible framework that can assimilate water level data which are arbitrarily distributed in time and space. The setup has been used to assimilate CryoSat-2 water level observations over the Assam valley for the years 2010-2015, using an Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (ETKF). Performance improvement in terms of discharge forecasting skill was then evaluated. For experiments with synthetic CryoSat-2 data the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) was improved by up to 32%, whilst for experiments assimilating real data it could be improved by up to 10%. The developed methods are expected to be transferable to other rivers and altimeter missions. The model setup and calibration is based almost entirely on globally available remote sensing data.

AB Stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) has been widely used to derive operating policies for reservoirs considering streamflow uncertainties. In SDP, there is a need to calculate the transition probability matrix more accurately and efficiently in order to improve the economic benefit of reservoir operation. In this study, we proposed a stochastic optimization model for hydropower generation reservoirs, in which 1) the transition probability matrix was calculated based on copula functions; and 2) the value function of the last period was calculated by stepwise iteration. Firstly, the marginal distribution of stochastic inflow in each period was built and the joint distributions of adjacent periods were obtained using the three members of the Archimedean copulas, based on which the conditional probability formula was derived. Then, the value in the last period was calculated by a simple recursive equation with the proposed stepwise iteration method and the value function was fitted with a linear regression model. These improvements were incorporated into the classic SDP and applied to the case study in Ertan reservoir, China. The results show that the transition probability matrix can be more easily and accurately obtained by the proposed copula function based method than conventional methods based on the observed or synthetic streamflow series, and the reservoir operation benefit can also be increased.

AB Hydrological model parameters are typically calibrated by observed streamflow data. This calibration strategy is questioned when the simulated hydrological variables of interest are not limited to stream flow. Well-performed streamflow simulations do not guarantee the reliable reproduction of other hydrological variables. One of the reasons is that hydrological model parameters are not reasonably identified. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)-derived total water storage change (MSC) data provide an opportunity to constrain hydrological model parameterizations in combination with stream flow observations. In this study, a multi-objective calibration scheme based on GRACE-derived TWSC and streamflow observations was compared with the traditional single-objective calibration scheme based on only streamflow simulations. Two hydrological models were employed on 22 catchments in China with different climatic conditions. The model evaluations were performed using observed streamflows, GRACE -derived TWSC, and actual evapotranspiration (ET) estimates from flux towers and from the water balance approach. Results showed that the multi-objective calibration scheme provided more reliable TWSC and ET simulations without significant deterioration in the accuracy of streamflow simulations than the single-objective calibration. The improvement in TWSC and ET simulations was more significant in relatively dry catchments than in relatively wet catchments. In addition, hydrological models calibrated using GRACE-derived TWSC data alone cannot obtain accurate runoff simulations in ungauged catchments. This study highlights the importance of including additional constraints in addition to streamflow observations to improve performances of hydrological models. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Water resources in coastal areas can be profoundly influenced by both climate change and human activities. These climatic and human impacts are usually intertwined and difficult to isolate. This study developed an integrated model-based approach for detection and attribution of climatic and human impacts and applied this approach to the Luanhe Plain, a typical coastal area in northern China. An integrated surface water-groundwater model was developed for the study area using GSFLOW (coupled groundwater and surface-water flow). Model calibration and validation were performed for background years between 1975 and 2000. The variation in water resources between the 1980s and 1990s was then quantitatively attributed to climate variability, groundwater pumping and changes in upstream inflow. Climate scenarios for future years (2075-2100) were also developed by downscaling the projections in CMIP5. Potential water resource responses to climate change, as well as their uncertainty, were then investigated through integrated modeling. The study results demonstrated the feasibility and value of the integrated modeling-based analysis for water resource management in areas with complex surface water groundwater interaction. Specific findings for the Luanhe Plain included the following: (1) During the historical period, upstream inflow had the most significant impact on river outflow to the sea, followed by climate variability, whereas groundwater pumping was the least influential. (2) The increase in groundwater pumping had a dominant influence on the decline in groundwater change, followed by climate variability. (3) Synergetic and counteractive effects among different impacting factors, while identified, were not significant, which implied that the interaction among different factors was not very strong in this case. (4) It is highly probable that future climate change will accelerate groundwater depletion in the study area, implying that strict regulations for groundwater pumping are imperative for adaptation.

AB Coastal areas submitted to seawater intrusion and with discharges from urban and industrial wastewaters, municipal landfill leachates, rivers, recreational waters and other sources are sensitive to be polluted with parabens. Understanding the fate of these compounds in environmental studies, it requires previously the knowledge of the reactive processes in controlled conditions. In this research, laboratory columns experiments were carried out with a group of parabens (methyl-, ethyl-, propyl- and butylparaben) and their main degradation compound (4-hydroxybenzoic acid) to study mainly the dynamic sorption processes in different aquifer materials (100% sand and heterogeneous: 81% sand, 9% silt and 10% clay) and with fresh and sea waters, the end members of seawater intrusions. To the column hydrodynamic characterization, tracer assays with increase and decrease of salinity were performed, to obtain the mean residence time of each column and other transport parameters which allow us to compare parabens' sorption in different conditions. The results of the adsorption and desorption of parabens in the sand column demonstrated be fast and simultaneous, with a short delay and without influence of the water salinity. Very different results were found in the column experiments with heterogeneous material, where the presence of clay and organic matter increase the time of adsorption/desorption as the length of the alkyl chain paraben increased, according with their hydrophobicity. It should be noted that despite the quick desorption of the major quantities of parabens, the elution of their trace concentrations was very slow (for the seawater, the buthylparaben required a dimensionless time of 800). Planning the restoration of a coastal aquifer with freshwater, and in the conditions of the studied sand column experiment, it will need a dimensionless time of 160. However, it is necessary to take into account that the studied parabens and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid are biodegradable substances, as can be seen in long term experiments, when bacterial proliferation could occur, despite starting the experiment under sterile conditions.

AB Drought is an extreme natural disaster that can lead to huge socioeconomic losses. Drought prediction ahead of months is helpful for early drought warning and preparations. In this study, we developed a statistical model, two weighted dynamic models and a statistical-dynamic (hybrid) model for 1-6 month lead drought prediction in China. Specifically, statistical component refers to climate signals weighting by support vector regression (SVR), dynamic components consist of the ensemble mean (EM) and Bayesian model averaging (BMA) of the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) climatic models, and the hybrid part denotes a combination of statistical and dynamic components by assigning weights based on their historical performances. The results indicate that the statistical and hybrid models show better rainfall predictions than NMME-EM and NMME-BMA models, which have good predictability only in southern China. In the 2011 China winter-spring drought event, the statistical model well predicted the spatial extent and severity of drought nationwide, although the severity was underestimated in the mid-lower reaches of Yangtze River (MLRYR) region. The NMME-EM and NMME-BMA models largely overestimated rainfall in northern and western China in 2011 drought. In the 2013 China summer drought, the NMME-EM model forecasted the drought extent and severity in eastern China well, while the statistical and hybrid models falsely detected negative precipitation anomaly (NPA) in some areas. Model ensembles such as multiple statistical approaches, multiple dynamic models or multiple hybrid models for drought predictions were highlighted. These conclusions may be helpful for drought prediction and early drought warnings in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Resolving the potential groundwater yield zonation of sandstone aquifers occurring at depths of several hundred meters has been an important and challenging objective of the hydrogeological research focused on preventing flood hazards in coal mines. Using accessible geological exploration data we put forward a method of predicting the spatial distribution of groundwater storage potential in sandstone aquifers from Permian-age coal deposits in Juye Coalfield, Shangdong, China. A Geological, Tectonic and Lithological Composition Index (GTLCI) model was created using the following parameters: sandstone depth and thickness, faults length density (FaLD), faults density (FaD), fault frequency density (FaFD), fault scale density (FaSD), variation coefficient of the slope (VCS) of the coal seam, intensity index of folds in horizontal direction (IIFoH), and lithological composition index (LCI). Each of these factors was subsequently divided into 5 classes. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and trapezoidal fuzzy number (TFN) method was applied to calculate the weight of the conditioning factor and their respective sub-classes. Groundwater yield potential contour map, which was initially constructed using the GTLCI values revealed four groundwater abundance zones. The map was further refined by taking into account hydro geologic data collected during mining activities. The GTLCI model predictive success rate of 80% was explained by the limited number of boreholes available for validation. It is considered that the GTLCI model is effective at predicting zonation of groundwater yield in the sandstone aquifers from Permian-age coal deposits in Juye Coalfield, China.

AB Recent observations indicate that over the last decades, climate change has increasingly influenced the frequency, intensity and duration of extreme climatic and hydrologic events. The main aim of this study is to determine the hydrologic response, especially the flood evolution, of the Lena River in Eastern Siberia to ongoing climate change. Draining the coldest region of the Northern Hemisphere, the Lena River is impacted by global warming, which is particularly pronounced in periglacial areas characterized by deep and continuous permafrost. We document the hydrologic variability of the Middle Lena River, first by characterizing trend and stationarity of monthly discharges. Second, we analyze on the basis of the peak over threshold method (POT) the temporal evolution of intensity and duration of three discharge classes: bar-full discharge, bank-full discharge and large floods. Finally, we also determined the dates of the flood beginning and of the flood peak. Data on mean monthly discharge and flood peaks are available since 1936 and daily discharges since 1954. Our results provide evidence for a net hydrologic change with an increase in the intensity and duration of floods in the two decades ending in 2012. The frequency of high floods is unprecedented, and small floods no longer occur. The tail of the temporal distribution of the flood peak is also changing. More frequent early floods are occurring in spring with secondary flood peaks in summer, the latest probably represents the most striking change. Furthermore, the changes have been accelerating since 2004. Finally, two islands were instrumented (2008-2012) in order to study the flooding dynamics with a better precision. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The In-Well Point Velocity Probe (IWPVP) is a novel device designed for obtaining rapid, initial measurements of groundwater velocity at the centimeter-scale using a standard monitoring well to access the subsurface. IWPVP measurements of groundwater speed are quantified on the basis of a mini-tracer test that is conducted within the body of the probe. Information regarding horizontal flow directions is obtained from differential responses at detectors placed in the four quadrants of the probe. The viability of the IWPVP design was confirmed by (1) numerical modeling that accounted for laminar flow in the porous medium outside the well and turbulent flow inside the well (and probe), and (2) a series of laboratory tank experiments in which the probe was calibrated to quantify seepage rates in a medium-grain sand. Laboratory tests were completed in less than 20 min in all cases, when seepage velocity was between 50 and 400 cm/day. The magnitude of the groundwater velocity was determined with a precision of +/- 7% on average, and accuracy of +/- 11% for seepage velocities up to 400 cm/day. The flow direction was determined within +/- 15 degrees. The IWPVP appears to be a viable tool for rapid assessment of groundwater velocity. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Determining groundwater discharge to streams using dissolved gases is known to be useful over a wide range of streamflow rates but the suitability of dissolved gas methods to determine discharge rates in high gradient mountain streams has not been sufficiently tested, even though headwater streams are critical as ecological habitats and water resources. The aim of this study is to test the suitability of using dissolved gases to determine groundwater discharge rates to high gradient streams by field experiments in a well-characterized, high gradient mountain stream and a literature review. At a reach scale (550 m) we combined stream and groundwater radon activity measurements with an in-stream SF6 tracer test. By means of numerical modeling we determined gas exchange velocities and derived very low groundwater discharge rates (similar to 15% of streamflow). These groundwater discharge rates are below the uncertainty range of physical streamflow measurements and consistent with temperature, specific conductance and streamflow measured at multiple locations along the reach. At a watershed-scale (4 km), we measured CFC-12 and delta O-18 concentrations and determined gas exchange velocities and groundwater discharge rates with the same numerical model. The groundwater discharge rates along the 4 km stream reach were highly variable, but were consistent with the values derived in the detailed study reach. Additionally, we synthesized literature values of gas exchange velocities for different stream gradients which show an empirical relationship that will be valuable in planning future dissolved gas studies on streams with various gradients. In sum, we show that multiple dissolved gas tracers can be used to determine groundwater discharge to high gradient mountain streams from reach to watershed scales. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Cost-benefit analysis and flood frequency analysis have been integrated into a comprehensive framework to estimate cost effective design values. However, previous cost-benefit based extreme flood estimation is based on stationary assumptions and analyze dependent flood variables separately. A Non-Stationary Cost-Benefit based bivariate design flood estimation (NSCOBE) approach is developed in this study to investigate influence of non-stationarities in both the dependence of flood variables and the marginal distributions on extreme flood estimation. The dependence is modeled utilizing copula functions. Previous design flood selection criteria are not suitable for NSCOBE since they ignore time changing dependence of flood variables. Therefore, a risk calculation approach is proposed based on non-stationarities in both marginal probability distributions and copula functions. A case study with 54-year observed data is utilized to illustrate the application of NSCOBE. Results show NSCOBE can effectively integrate nonstationarities in both copula functions and marginal distributions into cost-benefit based design flood estimation. It is also found that there is a trade-off between maximum probability of exceedance calculated from copula functions and marginal distributions. This study for the first time provides a new approach towards a better understanding of influence of non-stationarities in both copula functions and marginal distributions on extreme flood estimation, and could be beneficial to cost-benefit based non-stationary bivariate design flood estimation across the world.

AB Europe has experienced a series of major floods in the past years which suggests that flood magnitudes may have increased. Land degradation due to soil compaction from crop farming or grazing intensification is one of the potential drivers of this increase. A literature review suggests that most of the experimental evidence was generated at plot and hillslope scales. At larger scales, most studies are based on models. There are three ways in which soil compaction affects floods at the catchment scale: (i) through an increase in the area affected by soil compaction; (ii) by exacerbating the effects of changes in rainfall, especially for highly degraded soils; and (iii) when soil compaction coincides with soils characterized by a fine texture and a low infiltration capacity. We suggest that future research should focus on better synthesising past research on soil compaction and runoff, tailored field experiments to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the coupled mechanical and hydraulic processes, new mapping methods of soil compaction that combine mechanical and remote sensing approaches, and an effort to bridge all disciplines relevant to soil compaction effects on floods.

AB Estimating continental water availability is of great importance for water resources management, in terms of maintaining ecosystem integrity and sustaining society development. To more accurately quantify the predictability of water availability, on the basis of univariate probabilistic Budyko framework, a bivariate probabilistic Budyko approach was developed using copula-based joint distribution model for considering the dependence between parameter omega of Wang-Tang's equation and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and was applied globally. The results indicate the predictive performance in global water availability is conditional on the climatic condition. In comparison with simple univariate distribution, the bivariate one produces the lower interquartile range under the same global dataset, especially in the regions with higher NDVI values, highlighting the importance of developing the joint distribution by taking into account the dependence structure of parameter omega and NDVI, which can provide more accurate probabilistic evaluation of water availability.

AB It is vital to identify drought events and to evaluate multivariate drought characteristics based on a composite drought index for better drought risk assessment and sustainable development of water resources. However, most composite drought indices are constructed by the linear combination, principal component analysis and entropy weight method assuming a linear relationship among different drought indices. In this study, the multidimensional copulas function was applied to construct a nonlinear multivariate drought index (NMDI) to solve the complicated and nonlinear relationship due to its dependence structure and flexibility. The NMDI was constructed by combining meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural variables (precipitation, runoff, and soil moisture) to better reflect the multivariate variables simultaneously. Based on the constructed NMDI and runs theory, drought events for a particular area regarding three drought characteristics: duration, peak, and severity were identified. Finally, multivariate drought risk was analyzed as a tool for providing reliable support in drought decision-making. The results indicate that: (1) multidimensional copulas can effectively solve the complicated and nonlinear relationship among multivariate variables; (2) compared with single and other composite drought indices, the NMDI is slightly more sensitive in capturing recorded drought events; and (3) drought risk shows a spatial variation; out of the five partitions studied, the Jing River Basin as well as the upstream and midstream of the Wei River Basin are characterized by a higher multivariate drought risk. In general, multidimensional copulas provides a reliable way to solve the nonlinear relationship when constructing a comprehensive drought index and evaluating multivariate drought characteristics.

ID GLOBAL SURVEY; EXTREME; PRECIPITATION
AB Frequency analysis of hydrometeorological and hydrological extremes is needed for the design of hydraulic and civil infrastructure facilities as well as water resources management. A multitude of distributions have been employed for frequency analysis of these extremes. However, no single distribution has been accepted as a global standard. Employing the entropy theory, this study derived five generalized distributions for frequency analysis that used different kinds of information encoded as constraints. These distributions were the generalized gamma (GG), the generalized beta distribution of the second kind (GB2), and the Halphen type A distribution (Hal-A), Halphen type B distribution (Hal-B) and Halphen type inverse B distribution (Hal-IB), among which the GG and GB2 distribution were previously derived by Papalexiou and Koutsoyiannis (2012) and the Halphen family was first derived using entropy theory in this paper. The entropy theory allowed to estimate parameters of the distributions in terms of the constraints used for their derivation. The distributions were tested using extreme daily and hourly rainfall data. Results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) values were very small, which indicated that the five generalized distributions fitted the extreme rainfall data well. Among them, according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC) values, generally the GB2 and Halphen family gave a better fit. Therefore, those general distributions are one of the best choices for frequency analysis. The entropy based derivation led to a new way for frequency analysis of hydrometeorological extremes.

AB In this research, an export coefficient based inexact fuzzy bi-level multi-objective programming (EC-IFBLMOP) model was developed through integrating export coefficient model (ECM), interval parameter programming (IPP) and fuzzy parameter programming (FPP) within a bi-level multi-objective programming framework. The proposed EC-IFBLMOP model can effectively deal with the multiple uncertainties expressed as discrete intervals and fuzzy membership functions. Also, the complexities in agricultural systems, such as the cooperation and gaming relationship between the decision makers at different levels, can be fully considered in the model. The developed model was then applied to identify the optimal land use patterns and BMP implementing levels for agricultural nonpoint source (NPS) pollution management in a subcatchment in the upper stream watershed of the Miyun Reservoir in north China. The results of the model showed that the desired optimal land use patterns and implementing levels of best management of practices (BMPs) would be obtained. It is the gaming result between the upper- and lower-level decision makers, when the allowable discharge amounts of NPS pollutants were limited. Moreover, results corresponding to different decision scenarios could provide a set of decision alternatives for the upper- and lower-level decision makers to identify the most appropriate management strategy. The model has a good applicability and can be effectively utilized for agricultural NPS pollution management. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate indices characterize climate systems and may identify important indicators for long-term precipitation, which are driven by climate interactions in atmosphere-ocean circulation. In this study, we investigated the climate indices that are effective indicators of long-term precipitation in South Korea, and examined their relationships based on statistical methods. Monthly total precipitation was collected from a total of 60 meteorological stations, and they were decomposed by ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) to identify the inherent oscillating patterns or cycles. Cross-correlation analysis and step-wise variable selection were employed to select the significant climate indices at each station. The climate indices that affect the monthly precipitation in South Korea were identified based on the selection frequencies of the selected indices at all stations. The NINO12 indices with four- and ten-month lags and AMO index with no lag were identified as indicators of monthly precipitation in South Korea. Moreover, they indicate meaningful physical information (e.g. periodic oscillations and long-term trend) inherent in the monthly precipitation. The NINO12 indices with four- and ten-month lags was a strong indicator representing periodic oscillations in monthly precipitation. In addition, the long-term trend of the monthly precipitation could be explained by the AMO index. A multiple linear regression model was constructed to investigate the influences of the identified climate indices on the prediction of monthly precipitation. Three identified climate indices successfully explained the monthly precipitation in the winter dry season. Compared to the monthly precipitation in coastal areas, the monthly precipitation in inland areas showed stronger correlation to the identified climate indices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The objective of this study was to exploit the synergy between SMOS and SMAP based on vegetation optical depth (VOD) to improve brightness temperature (TB) simulations and land surface soil moisture (SM) retrievals in arid regions of the world. In the current operational algorithm of SMAP (level 2), vegetation water content (VWC) is considered as a proxy to compute VOD which is calculated by an empirical conversion function of NDVI. Avoiding the empirical estimation of VOD, the SMOS algorithm is used to retrieve simultaneously SM and VOD from TB observations. The present study attempted to improve SMAP TB simulations and SM retrievals by benefiting from the advantages of the SMOS (L-MEB) algorithm, This was achieved by using a synergy method based on replacing the default value of SMAP VOD with the retrieved value of VOD from the SMOS multi angular and bi-polarization observations of TB. The insitu SM measurements, used as reference SM in this study, were obtained from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) over 180 stations located in arid regions of the world. Furthermore, four stations were randomly selected to analyze the temporal variations in VOD and SM. Results of the synergy method showed that the accuracy of the TB simulations and SM retrievals was respectively improved at 144 and 124 stations (out of a total of 180 stations) in terms of coefficient of determination (R-2) and unbiased root mean squared error (UbRMSE). Analyzing the temporal variations in VOD showed that the SMOS VOD, conversely to the SMAP VOD, can better illustrate the presence of herbaceous plants and may be a better indicator of the seasonal changes in the vegetation density and biomass over the year.

   reflectometer; Tipping bucket rain gauge
AB Permeable pavement is a stormwater control measure commonly selected in both new and retrofit applications. However, there is limited information about the clogging mechanism of these systems that effects the infiltration. A permeable pavement site located at the Seitz Elementary School, on Fort Riley, Kansas was selected for this study. An 80-space parking lot was built behind the school as part of an EPA collaboration with the U.S. Army. The parking lot design includes a permeable interlocking concrete pavement section along the downgradient edge. This study monitored the clogging progress of the pavement section using twelve water content reflectometers and three buried tipping bucket rain gauges. This clogging dynamic investigation was divided into three stages namely pre-clogged, transitional, and clogged. Recorded initial relative water content of all three stages were significantly and negatively correlated to antecedent dry weather periods with stronger correlations during clogged conditions. The peak relative water content correlation with peak rainfall 10-min intensity was significant for the water content reflectometers located on the western edge away from the eastern edge; this correlation was strongest during transition stage. Once clogged, rainfall measurements no longer correlated with the buried tipping bucket rain gauges. Both water content reflectometers and buried tipping bucket rain gauges showed the progress of surface clogging. For every 6 mm of rain, clogging advanced 1 mm across the surface. The results generally support the hypothesis that the clogging progresses from the upgradient to the downgradient edge. The magnitude of the contributing drainage area and rainfall characteristics are effective factors on rate and progression of clogging. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The skill of hydrologic models, such as those used in operational flood prediction, is currently restricted by the availability of flow gauges and by the quality of the streamflow data used for calibration. The increased availability of remote sensing products provides the opportunity to further improve the model forecasting skill. A joint calibration scheme using streamflow measurements and remote sensing derived soil moisture values was examined and compared with a streamflow only calibration scheme. The efficacy of the two calibration schemes was tested in three modelling setups: 1) a lumped model; 2) a semi-distributed model with only the outlet gauge available for calibration; and 3) a semi-distributed model with multiple gauges available for calibration. The joint calibration scheme was found to slightly degrade the streamflow prediction at gauged sites during the calibration period compared with stream flow only calibration, but improvement was found at the same gauged sites during the independent validation period. A more consistent and statistically significant improvement was achieved at gauged sites not used in the calibration, due to the spatial information introduced by the remotely sensed soil moisture data. It was also found that the impact of using soil moisture for calibration tended to be stronger at the upstream and tributary sub-catchments than at the downstream sub-catchments.

AB Biotic leaf transpiration (T) and abiotic evaporation (E) are the two major pathways by which water is transferred from land surfaces to the atmosphere. Earth system models simulating the terrestrial water, carbon and energy cycle are required to reliably embed the role of soil and vegetation processes in order to realistically reproduce both fluxes including their relative contributions to total evapotranspiration (ET). Earth system models are also being used with increasing spatial resolutions to better simulate the effects of surface heterogeneity on the regional water and energy cycle and to realistically include effects of subsurface lateral flow paths, which are expected to feed back on the exchange fluxes and their partitioning in the model.
   Using the hydrological component of the Terrestrial Systems Modeling Platform (TerrSysMP), we examine the uncertainty in the estimates of T/ET ratio due to horizontal model grid resolution for a dry and wet year in the Inde catchment (western Germany). The aggregation of topography results in smoothing of slope magnitudes and the filtering of small-scale convergence and divergence zones, which directly impacts the surface-subsurface flow. Coarsening of the grid resolution from 120 m to 960 m increased the available soil moisture for ground evaporation, and decreased T/ET ratio by about 5% and 8% for dry and wet year respectively. The change in T/ET ratio was more pronounced for agricultural crops compared to forested areas, indicating a strong local control of vegetation on the ground evaporation, affecting the domain average statistics.

AB Mean response time (MRT) is a metric describing the propagation of catchment hydraulic behavior that reflects both hydro-climatic conditions and catchment characteristics. To provide a comprehensive understanding of catchment response over a longer-time scale for hydraulic processes, the MRT function for baseflow generation was derived using an instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH) model that describes the subsurface response to effective rainfall inputs. IUH parameters were estimated based on the "match test" between the autocorrelation function (ACFs) derived from the filtered base flow time series and from the IUH parameters, under the GLUE framework. Regionalization of MRT was conducted using estimates and hydroclimate-landscape indices in 22 sub-basins of the Jinghe River Basin ORB) in the Loess Plateau of northwest China. Results indicate there is strong equifinality in determination of the best parameter sets but the median values of the MRT estimates are relatively stable in the acceptable range of the parameters. MRTs vary markedly over the studied sub-basins, ranging from tens of days to more than a year. Climate, topography and geomorphology were identified as three first-order controls on recharge-baseflow response processes. Human activities involving the cultivation of permanent crops may elongate the baseflow MRT and hence increase the dynamic storage. Cross validation suggests the model can be used to estimate MRTs in ungauged catchments in similar regions of throughout the Loess Plateau. The proposed method provides a systematic approach for MRT estimation and regionalization in terms of hydroclimate and catchment characteristics, which is helpful in the sustainable water resources utilization and ecological protection in the Loess Plateau.

AB The mechanical performances of alkali-activated granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS) based geopolymer modified with polyacrylic resin were investigated in this paper. The water-to-binder ratio, alkaline activator content (Na2O wt%) and SiO2/Na2O molar ratio in this experiment maintained at 0.5, 6% and 0.8, respectively. Geopolymer samples were synthesized by alkaline solution and GBFS with incorporating amount of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 3.0 and 5.0 wt% polyacrylic resin. The mechanical properties of samples were measured using compression tests, flexure tests and bending toughness tests. The results show that the compressive and flexural strength were both up to the maximum value while doping 1 wt% polyacrylic resin, the ratio of flexural-compressive strength and bending toughness at curing 28 days were increased by 36.3% and 104.6% respectively, compared with the control samples. The structural evolutions of specimen after incorporating polyacrylic resin were characterised by FTIR as well as Si-29 NMR spectroscopy. It indicated that a new absorption peak namely Si-O-C bond at wavenumber of about 1180 cm(-1) in the FAIR spectra appeared while incorporating polyacrylic resin whatever 1 wt% or 5 wt%, the chemical shifts corresponding resonance peaks of siliceous species moved towards to low field, and the polymerization degree of Si transformed from Q(3), Q(4) to Q(0), Q(1), Q(2).

AB Volatile loss of technetium (Tc) during vitrification of low-activity wastes is a technical challenge for treating and immobilizing the large volumes of radioactive and hazardous wastes stored at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site. Various research efforts are being pursued to develop technologies that can be implemented for cost effective management of Tc, including studies to understand the behavior of Tc during vitrification, with the goal of eventually increasing Tc retention in glass. One of these studies has focused on identifying the form or species of Tc and Re (surrogate for Tc) that evolve during the waste-to-glass conversion process. This information is important for understanding the mechanism of Tc volatilization. In this paper, available information collected from the literature is critically evaluated to clarify the volatile species of Tc and Re and, more specifically, whether they volatilize as alkali pertechnetate and perrhenate or as technetium and rhenium oxides after decomposition of alkali pertechnetate and perrhenate. The evaluated data ranged from mass spectrometric identification of species volatilized from pure and binary alkali pertechnetate and perrhenate salts to structural and chemical analyses of volatilized materials during crucible melting and scaled melter processing of simulated wastes.

AB The non-isothermal crystallization kinetics and fragility of Zr56CO28Al16 and Zr56CO24Ag84Al16 bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and microhardness test were used to investigate the glassy alloys structure. DSC traces exhibited two crystallization processes for both alloys. The activation energies of characteristic temperatures were obtained by Kissinger and Ozawa methods. Also, the heating rate sensitivity of characteristic temperatures was determined. The Ag-bearing Zr-based BMG presented higher activation energies and lower heating rate sensitivity in regard to characteristic temperatures, indicating a higher stabilization of the supercooled liquid, which can be correlated with the existence of strong icosahedral short range order (ISRO) clusters in the structure. In addition, the local Avrami exponents at various heating rates were calculated by the Johnson Mehl Avrami equation. The is value variations for each crystallization process pursued almost similar trends for both alloys with n > 2.5, revealing that the transformation kinetics is dominated by a diffusion controlled three-dimensional growth, as well as an increase in the nucleation rate. Moreover, both BMGs were classified into "strong glasses", depending on the fragility index calculated values.

DE Alkali-free boro-aluminosilicate glass; Substrate glass; Y2O3 doped
AB Alkali-free boro-aluminosilicate glasses were prepared by the melt quenching method. The effect of Al2O3 replaced by different contents of Y2O3 on the structure and various properties of alkali-free boro-aluminosilicate glasses was studied. The changes of glass structure with varying components were investigated by the Fourier transform infrared spectra. Simultaneously, the relationship between the glass structure and the coefficient of thermal expansion, density, vickers hardness, bending strength, glass transmittance and chemical stability was discussed. The results show that the coefficient of thermal expansion and the density of glass increase with the increase of Y2O3 content. While, the chemical stability of the glass is reduced. The vickers hardness and bending strength decrease first and then increase with the Y2O3 content increasing. All the glasses have excellent optical transmittance, reaching more than 85%.

AB The electron paramagnetic resonance parameters and local structures for V4+ in xV(2)O(5)-(100 - x)[0.8NaPO(3)-0.2ZnO] glasses are theoretically investigated by using the perturbation formulas for tetragonally compressed octahedral 3d(1) clusters. Polynomial, custom and power law functions are applied to describe the concentration variations of covalency factor N, relatively tetragonal compression ratio rho, core polarization constant kappa and reduction factor H. The concentration dependences of the measured electron paramagnetic resonance parameters are suitably reproduced, and the PL functions are found to be the optimal with the lowest mean absolute percentage deviation from the experimental data. The [VO6](8-) clusters exhibit moderately decreasing N, rapidly increasing rho, slightly decreasing kappa and moderately increasing H with x. The calculated decreasing local optical basicity A(loc) also supports the declining trend of covalency factor. The theoretical study of the microscopic mechanisms for the concentration dependences of the relevant quantities are discussed in view of the impurity local behaviors with x due to mixed alkali effect.

AB This study continues our previous investigations on non-traditional silver selenite molybdate amorphous materials. A glass containing SeO2, MoO3 and Ag2O was obtained by the melt quenching method in a sealed silica ampoule using Ag2SeO3 and MoO3 as precursors. The real bulk chemical composition of the glass was verified by the LA-ICP-MS method. The amorphous sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), UV-Vis, XPS and IR spectroscopy. The as prepared glass was subjected to two different heat treatments: i) at 200 degrees C for 8h in air and ii) at 300 degrees C for 4h it a N-2 + H-2 (80%) gas flow. The obtained results were different depending on the heat treatment conditions. By IR analysis the main units building up the amorphous network were found to be SeO3 and MoO6. The XPS spectroscopy reveals the existence of bridging oxygen bonds (Mo-O-Mo) and mixed bridging bonds (Ag-O-Se and Se-O-Mo). It was established by UV-Vis that the absorption edge of the glass is about 540 nm. It was also found that the silver plasmon resonance band appeared about 380 nm.

AB Notable improvements in the glass-forming ability (GFA) of Zr-based metallic glasses with melt hydrogenation have been reported in our previous studies. The effects of hydrogen on GFA are usually explained via short-range structural order, local symmetry, structural free-volume, and bonding character. To fundamentally understand why hydrogen enhances GFA, thermal analyses were carried out on a Zr55Cu30Ni5Al10 amorphous alloy to assess how hydrogen affected viscosity, fragility, critical cooling rate, and Gibbs free energy difference, AG. Amorphous alloys subjected to melt hydrogenation were found to possess higher viscosity and lower fragility, indicating increased GFA. The critical cooling rate of hydrogenated alloy melts gradually decreased and the lowest critical cooling rate was 10 K/s when the alloy was fabricated in Ar + 10%H-2. The liquid/solid AG of melt-hydrogenated alloy was significantly smaller than that of the equivalent non-hydrogen alloy. From thermodynamic and dynamic perspectives, viscosity, fragility, critical cooling rate, and AG demonstrated that melt hydrogenation improved these alloys' GFA and explained the present experimentally observed improvements in GFA.

PL spectra for all the Dy3+-doped samples show emission bands at 453 nm (blue), 482 nm (blue), 573 nm (yellow), 662 nm (red), and 752 nm (red) corresponding to the I-4(35/2) -> H-6(15/2) -> F-4(9/2) -> H-6(15/2), F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2), F-4(9/2) -> H-6(11/2), and F-4(9/2) -> (6)H(9/)2 transitions, respectively, upon excitation at 350 nm. Here, Dy3+: Li-Na glass shows the highest PL intensity for all identified emissions. The yellow-to-blue (Y/B) emission intensity ratio (varied within the range 1.257-L376), CIE chromaticity coordinates (x,y) (slight variation between (0.3410, 0.3802) and (0.3495, 0.3872), and correlated color temperatures (CCT5) (changed from 4953 K to 5212 K) are calculated following the PL spectra. Dy3+ F-4(9/2) decay curves show non-exponential behavior and are fitted by the Inokuti-Hirayama (I-H) model, where S = 6 shows best fit, indicating dipole-dipole (d-d) interactions for Dy3+ excited (donor) and ground state (acceptor) ions.

Based on the obtained spectral data it was suggested that in the absence of La2O3, tungsten incorporates into boro-bismuthate network in small quantities through Bi3+ and B-O-W bonds are not formed. Accumulation of Bi-O-W bonds stimulates crystallization processes. La2O3 is crucial to connect tungstate units with boro-bismuthate glass matrix and to realize amorphous network with their participation. It was supposed that in glasses with higher WO3 content (30 and 40 mol%) two inconsisted glass networks are formed bismuth borate one built up by BO3, BO4, BiO6 units and tungstate one, built up mainly by WO6. These networks are interconnected through lanthanum.

ID SUPERCOOLED LIQUID; CU47TI34ZR11NI8; THERMODYNAMICS; TRANSFORMATION
AB Understanding the crystallization behavior of metallic glasses (MGs) during laser processing is important in additive manufacturing of MGs, which would overcome the limitation of section-thickness. Experiments were conducted to study the crystalline phase evolution, particularly in the heat-affected zone (HAZ), during laser processing of LM105 (Zr52.5Ti5Al10Ni1.46Cu17.9 (at.%)) MG plates. Three regions with distinct degree of crystallization in HAZ were found, which were caused by different thermal histories. The crystallization can be suppressed, however, by increasing the laser scan speed (100 mm/s in this study) while the laser power is fixed (100 W in this study). A complete model integrating the heat transfer and the classical nucleation/growth theory was developed to calculate the thermal history and the evolution of crystalline volume fraction. Modeling predictions on the depth of fusion zone (FZ) and thickness of HAZ for different laser processing parameters were validated by comparing with the experimental measurements. This study has demonstrated that at a specific location in the MG material, the use of critical cooling rate alone is not adequate to determine if the material is crystallized; instead the thermal history that the material experienced during both the laser heating and cooling processes is the key factor affecting the fmal crystallization. The model provides comprehensive understanding of the crystallization behavior during laser-MG interaction.

DE Crystallization; ZBLAN; Rapid cooling; Critical cooling rate;
   Microscopy; Diffraction experiment
AB ZBLAN glass is a heavy metal fluoride glass that shows great potential in the application of long-haul telecommunication cables. However, during processing in the fiber-drawing temperature region, the material tends to undergo heavy devitrification, resulting in a crystalline fiber that is not usable as an optical waveguide. In this study, ZBLAN glass was processed with different cooling rates to discern how the rate of tooling affects the process of crystallization. Rapidly cooled ZBLAN glass test samples were then analysed with a wide range of spectroscopy and imaging techniques including EDS, SEM, TEM and XRD. These techniques revealed there are two predominant crystal phases, one rich in zirconium and barium, the other in zirconium and sodium. Ultimately, a critical cooling rate was established to be somewhere between 900 degrees C/min and 4000 degrees C/min, with a theoretically predicted value of 1081 degrees C/min for a test sample volume size of 9.4 x 10(-8) m(3). Cooling above this critical cooling rate yielded fully amorphous ZBLAN test samples that were completely free of nano-crystalline inclusions. Using Kramers-Kronig relations, an attenuation loss for the fully amorphous ZBLAN test samples was estimated to be 0.09 dB/Km at a wavelength of 1800 nm.

AB Glass-ceramics with a mass fraction composition (wt%) of 19MgO center dot 23Al(2)O(3)-53SiO(2)center dot 4TiO(2)-xV(2)O(5) (x = 2.5, 3 and 3.5, abbreviated as samples V2.5, V3 and V3.5) were prepared by two-step heat treatment of the parent glass at selected nucleation and crystallization temperatures for different holding time (2 h and 20 h), respectively. The effects of V2O5 on crystalline phases, microstructures and microwave dielectric properties of the glass-ceramics were investigated in detail. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses revealed that the main phases could be identified as alpha-cordierite and SiO2 phases, and also some amount of-cordierite phase and a trace of Al2Si4O10, Mg(VO4)(2) and TiO2 phases were also detected in all these glass-ceramics' XRD patterns. In addition, an appropriate V2O5 addition with 3.0-3.5 wt% was found to cause an increase in the content of the precipitated crystalline phases. Based on the EDM observation, a fraction of Ti4+ and V5+ ions were remained in the residual glass matrix of the crystallized specimens. Additionally, the microwave dielectric properties were closely depended on not only the different two-step heat treatment temperatures and holding time, but also the relative densities and degree of crystallization of the glass matrix. Wherein, the fully densified V3 glass-ceramic sample heat-treated at 850 degrees C/2 h + 950 degrees C/20 h exhibited a lower dielectric constant (60 of 3.79, a higher quality factor (Q x f) of about 12,520 GHz (at 13.693 GHz) and a near-zero temperature coefficient of resonant frequency (rf) of 5.4 ppm/ degrees C, which provided a promising candidate for LTCC applications.

AB In this paper, the Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ (YAG) phosphor-in-glass (PIG) was successfully fabricated by one-step low-temperature co-sintering technology, which showed excellent thermal behavior and high visible transparency in the sintering case of 600 degrees C without noticeable interaction with phosphor. The luminescence performance of PiG-based WLEDs could be easily improved by tuning the phosphor concentration and specimen thickness. Experimental results demonstrated that the ideal phosphor content and specimen thickness are 8 wt%, 0.8 mm, respectively. Notably, the obtained WLED with an 8% phosphor content and 0.8 nun thickness exhibits a high luminous efficacy (LE) of 102.6 lm/w, a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 6290 K and a color rendering index (CRI) of 71.4, under the operating current of 20 mA. In addition, the test of temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) indicated that the thermal stability of PiGs was superior to the phosphor-in-silicone (PiS) up to 200 degrees C. Therefore, we fabricate a high transparent PiG with promising candidate for applications in the WLEDs.

AB In this paper, we report the existence of new bulk chalcogenide glasses free of germanium and transparent up to 18 gm. The investigation of the Ga-Sb-Se ternary diagram has allowed bringing out the presence of a small glassy domain mainly formed for compositions with low contents of Ga. Thermal, optical and mechanical characteristics of these glasses have been studied. In order to enhance the low stability against crystallization pure iodine was successfully added. At last, structural analysis by Raman spectroscopy was performed to point out the iodine addition effect.

AB The amorphous-forming ability (AFA), crystallization structure and magnetic properties of the melt-spun Fe-85 - xSi2B8P4Cu1Mox (x = 0-2) alloys were investigated. The addition of 1-2 at% Mo in the Fe85Si2B8P4Cu1 alloy enhances the AFA with increasing the critical thickness for amorphous formation from similar to 14 to similar to 20 mu m. The Mo alloying refines the microstructure and reduces the coercivity of the annealed alloys, and weakens the dependence of the coercivity on the heating rate, although it decreases the saturation magnetic flux density. After annealing under a low heating rate of 50 K/min, the average alpha-Fe grain size and coercivity of the Fe84Si2B8P4Cu1Mo1 alloy are similar to 25 nm and 23.9 A/m, respectively, which are lower than those of similar to 32 nm and 40.5 A/m for the base alloy. In addition, the mechanism related to the effects of Mo on the structure and magnetic properties was discussed in term of the crystallization activation energy.

AB Cu-Zr based alloys have been used as metallic glass alloys owing to their high glass forming ability (GFA). Ni is added into these alloys to enhance their mechanical property and improve GFA. These Cu-Ni-Zr ternary alloys have a high potential to be used as metallic glass alloys. Herein, we investigated and assessed thermodynamically the phase equilibria of the Cu-Ni-Zr ternary system at 800 degrees C using the calculation of phase diagram (CALPHAD) method based on the experimental data. Thirty-three alloys were prepared using the arc melting method. At 800 degrees C, the isothermal section of the Cu-Ni-Zr ternary system composed of 15 single-phase regions, 20 two-phase regions, and 8 three-phase regions; no ternary intermetallic compounds were found. In addition, a continuous solid solution was formed by the Cu10Zr7 and Ni10Zr7 phases at 800 degrees C. Furthermore, the thermodynamic parameters were optimized using the phase equilibrium data. The calculated isothermal section and metallic glass region prediction of the Cu-Ni-Zr ternary system were reasonable and satisfactory compared with the literature data.

AB We have previously described a highly diverse library of artificial repeat proteins based on thermostable HEAT like repeats, named alpha Rep. alpha Reps binding specifically to proteins difficult to crystallize have been selected and in several examples, they made possible the crystallization of these proteins. To further simplify the production and crystallization experiments we have explored the production of chimeric proteins corresponding to covalent association between the targets and their specific binders strengthened by a linker. Although chimeric proteins with expression partners are classically used to enhance expression, these fusions cannot usually be used for crystallization. With specific expression partners like a cognate alpha Rep this is no longer true, and chimeric proteins can be expressed purified and crystallized. alpha Rep selection by phage display suppose that at least a small amount of the target protein should be produced to be used as a bait for selection and this might, in some cases, be difficult. We have therefore transferred the alpha Rep library in a new construction adapted to selection by protein complementation assay (PCA). This new procedure allows to select specific binders by direct interaction with the target in the cytoplasm of the bacteria and consequently does not require preliminary purification of target protein. alpha Rep binders selected by PCA or by phage display can be used to enhance expression, stability, solubility and crystallogenesis of proteins that are otherwise difficult to express, purify and/or crystallize.

AB Designed armadillo repeat proteins (dArmRPs) were developed to create a modular peptide binding technology where each of the structural repeats binds two residues of the target peptide. An essential prerequisite for such a technology is a dArmRP geometry that matches the peptide bond length. To this end, we determined a large set (n = 27) of dArmRP X-ray structures, of which 12 were previously unpublished, to calculate curvature parameters that define their geometry. Our analysis shows that consensus dArmRPs exhibit curvatures close to the optimal range for modular peptide recognition. Binding of peptide ligands can induce a curvature within the desired range, as confirmed by single molecule FRET experiments in solution. On the other hand, computationally designed ArmRPs, where side chains have been chosen with the intention to optimally fit into a geometrically optimized backbone, turned out to be more divergent in reality, and thus not suitable for continuous peptide binding. Furthermore, we show that the formation of a crystal lattice can induce small but significant deviations from the curvature adopted in solution, which can interfere with the evaluation of repeat protein scaffolds when high accuracy is required. This study corroborates the suitability of consensus dArmRPs as a scaffold for the development of modular peptide binders.

AB In nature, assembled protein structures offer the most complex functional structures. The understanding of the mechanisms ruling protein-protein interactions opens the door to manipulate protein assemblies in a rational way. Proteins are versatile scaffolds with great potential as tools in nanotechnology and biomedicine because of their chemical, structural, and functional versatility. Currently, bottom-up self-assembly based on biomolecular interactions of small and well-defined components, is an attractive approach to biomolecular engineering and biomaterial design. Specifically, repeat proteins are simplified systems for this purpose.
   In this work, we provide an overview of fundamental concepts of the design of new protein interfaces. We describe an experimental approach to form higher order architectures by a bottom-up assembly of repeated building blocks. For this purpose, we use designed consensus tetratricopeptide repeat proteins (CTPRs). CTPR arrays contain multiple identical repeats that interact through a single inter-repeat interface to form elongated superhelices. Introducing a novel interface along the CTPR superhelix allows two CTPR molecules to assemble into protein nanotubes. We apply three approaches to form protein nanotubes: electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and pi-pi interactions. We isolate and characterize the stability and shape of the formed dimers and analyze the nanotube formation considering the energy of the interaction and the structure in the three different models. These studies provide insights into the design of novel protein interfaces for the control of the assembly into more complex structures, which will open the door to the rational design of nanostructures and ordered materials for many potential applications in nanotechnology.

AB Polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat-containing proteins are widespread in the human proteome but only nine of them are associated with highly incapacitating neurodegenerative disorders. The genetic expansion of the polyQ tract in disease-related proteins triggers a series of events resulting in neurodegeneration. The polyQ tract plays the leading role in the aggregation mechanism, but other elements modulate the aggregation propensity in the context of the full-length proteins, as implied by variations in the length of the polyQ tract required to trigger the onset of a given polyQ disease. Intrinsic features such as the presence of aggregation-prone regions (APRs) outside the polyQ segments and polyQ-flanking sequences, which synergistically participate in the aggregation process, are emerging for several disease-related proteins. The inherent polymorphic structure of polyQ stretches places the polyQ proteins in a central position in protein-protein interaction networks, where interacting partners may additionally shield APRs or reshape the aggregation course. Expansion of the polyQ tract perturbs the cellular homeostasis and contributes to neuronal failure by modulating protein-protein interactions and enhancing toxic oligomerization. Post-translational modifications further regulate self-assembly either by directly altering the intrinsic aggregation propensity of polyQ proteins, by modulating their interaction with different macromolecules or by modifying their withdrawal by the cell quality control machinery. Here we review the recent data on the multifaceted aggregation pathways of disease related polyQ proteins, focusing on ataxin-3, the protein mutated in Machado-Joseph disease.

AB This paper presents a novel approach for fabricating aluminum foam reinforced by graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) through the direct melt foaming method. With regard to this approach, GNFs coupled with the foaming agent were embedded on the surface of assistant agent via a cryomilling process. Experimental results showed most of GNFs were detected on the pore surface, only slight of GNFs were observed inside pore wall mixing with composite oxides. Besides, slight content of GNFs can significantly improve the pore structures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Synthesis and characterization of the rope morphology of the MCM-41 mesoporous material, was investigated by electrospinning technique. The synthesis was performed in basic condition. The MCM-41 morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement. Wheat stem (WS), an agricultural waste, and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were used as a silica and template sources for MCM-41 microfibers synthesis, respectively. The XRD study revealed a long range structural ordering of mesoporous materials. The TEM results indicated rough surfaces with uniform average diameter 2 mu m for microropes. According to SEM images, the micrometer-scaled ropes of MCM-41 materials were made from nanometer-sized fibers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Continuous mullite nanofibers with highly aligned structure were fabricated by conjugate electrospinning technique combined with the sol-gel method. Aluminum acetate stabilized with boric acid and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) were used as raw materials. Aligned and continuous as-spun nanofibers were prepared first. After calcining at 1000 degrees C, the obtained mullite nanofibers retained decent alignment and continuous structure despite the decomposition of PVP and other organics. Such fibers were composed of Al4B2O9 phase and amorphous SiO2. The elastic modulus of a single mullite nanofiber was 12.27 +/- 1.77 GPa and the tensile strength of the aligned mullite nanofiber bundle was 32.21 +/- 3.73 MPa. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Octacalcium phosphate (OCP) foam with an interconnected porous structure was fabricated through phase conversion via a dissolution-precipitation reaction using calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CSH: CaSO4.1/2H(2)O) granules as precursors in a sodium dihydrogen phosphate (NaDP: NaH2PO4) solution. The diametral tensile strength and porosity of the OCP foam were 0.15 +/- 0.04 MPa and 69.4% +/- 0.04%, respectively. When the OCP foam was implanted into bone defects in a rabbit femur, the OCP foam showed an excellent tissue response, and the bone penetrated into the porous structure. The osteoconductivity and bone-replacement rate were significantly higher than those of an OCP compact. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Si-CaP containing coatings were deposited on a Mg-Zn-Ca alloy by the two-step micro-arc oxidation processes. The surface and cross-section morphologies, EDS analysis, phase composition and polarization curves of MAO coatings were investigated. With the increasing of the two-step voltages, the number of micro-pores tended to decrease and the surfaces became more compact while the thickness of coatings continually increased. In addition, the corrosion resistance of Mg alloy was greatly improved with the SiCaP coatings, and the Mg alloy with Si-CaP coating prepared at 400 V had the best corrosion resistance.

AB In recent years, colloidal metallic nanoparticles (CM NPs) have gained popularity due to their unique size, shape and composition dependent physicochemical properties and their potential use in a variety of scientific and technical fields. Although it was the general trend to use the two traditional methods, the physical and chemical methods, in the synthesis of NPs, for a long time the drawbacks of those methods have recently moved the focus to the use of biomolecules (DNA, protein, enzyme and plant extracts) in preparation of NPs. While the physical methods cannot provide adequate control of size, shape and monodispersity, the chemical methods rely on the usage of toxic solvents and reducing agents.
   To address these issues, to offer a solution to the problems posed by the traditional, i.e. physical and chemical methods, DNA, proteins, enzymes and plant extracts have been actively utilized as reducing agent and/or capping agent for both the reduction metal ions and growing of biocompatible NPs. Thus, the application of biomolecules-directed-NPs has increased, especially in medicine as molecular imaging, drug delivery, theranostic and antimicrobial agents. This review is mainly focused on the biosynthesis of metallic NPs and their potential applications in medicine. Thus, using biomolecules is become one of the most emerging and exciting research in synthesis of CM NPs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The laser beam was focused on the centerline of Ta and Fe sheets respectively to ensure that V interlayer was not completely melted. Two pass welding was employed involving creation of a joint with two weld zones separated by remaining unmelted V. Composite interlayer Ta/V/Fe was used to prevent the formation of Ti-Fe intermetallics and improve microstructure and properties of the Ti alloy-SS joint. The joint fractured at the unmelted V with the tensile strength of 627 MPa. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Magnesium and its alloys are getting more attention in the field of tissue engineering as it is biodegradable as well as biocompatible. An open cell structure in particular offers the advantage of body fluid transportation through it and allows the growth of new tissues. Open cell Mg foams with pore interconnectivity are difficult to fabricate from conventional techniques. In the present work, a novel approach has been successfully developed to fabricate the open cell Mg structures with pore interconnectivity using powder metallurgy route and Ti-woven wire mesh as a space holding material. Pore morphology and percentage porosity can be easily altered by adjusting the Ti-wire diameter and shape of construct. Ti-woven wire mesh in the shape of netted wire gave the best result in terms of homogeneity of pores and strength. Maximum porosity achieved is 60% and ultimate tensile strength is measured to be 78 MPa for the porous structure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Novel high quality phenolic resin (PR) microspheres encoded by Fluorescence and Surface Enhanced Raman Spectra (SERS) were fabricated in the present work. The PR microspheres possessed autofluorescence property and could be jointly encoded with other fluorescent molecules including fluorescein isothiocyanate. The fluorescent encoded PR microspheres were modified with Ag nanoparticles and Raman label molecules for combination of SERS encoding, which is rarely reported. The dual-mode encoded microspheres were evaluated by MIT assay and flow cytometry. The results showed the high quality encoded microspheres presented promising application prospect in biomarker and detection of antibody, DNA and RNA. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Average particle sizes are found to be 11 nm, 50 nm and 151 nm for green, blue and brown, respectively. Nanocolorants exhibit fluorescent properties under blue, green and UV filters and possess good antibacterial efficiency (9-12 mm zone of inhibition). They are nontoxic and efficient for live cell fluorescent imaging with L929 cells. Cells stained with green nanocolorant show highest fluorescent intensity among all synthesized colorants and pure lignin. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Perovskite-type oxide of SmMnO3 sheet with mesoporous structures was successfully synthesized for the first time by a simple one-step calcination. Citric acid was utilized as the propellant for the construction of SmMnO3 perovskite structure and the mesoporous formation. The characterization results showed that a large number of mesoporous were evenly distributed into the SmMnO3 perovskites sheets by the effect of citric acid. The as-prepared catalyst showed superior catalytic activity and stability for toluene oxidation; the toluene conversion kept ca. 99.9% at 240 degrees C during the reaction of 36 h. This work could supply an impactful technique to prepare high catalytic activity of ABO(3) perovskites with mesoporous structure for the practical applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB We demonstrated a facile synthesis of carbon-doped g-C3N4 (donated as C-CN) photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution. The obtained C-CN photocatalyst showed a H-2 production rate of 40.37 mu molh 1 under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm), which is about 2.9 times of that over bare CN. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of C-CN can be ascribed to enhanced visible light adsorption and improved charge carrier separation, which is probably resulted from the delocalized TC bonds generated after C doping. It is anticipated that our work could provide a feasible way to improve the photocatalytic performance of CN. (C) 2017 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, the highly uniform hybrid nanoporous carbons (HPCs) have been prepared by employing chemical vapor deposition (CVD) approach to grow carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks (ZIF-67) and then subjected to anode for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). In terms of HPCs, CNTs act as bridge linking NPCs, resulting in net-work structure and thus improved conductivity. When employed as anode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), the HPCs deliver a high initial capacity of 677 mAh/g at current density of 50 mAh/g. Significantly, the capacity can be maintained at 312 mAh/g after 100 cycles, exhibiting 46% remaining. Even at high charge rate of 1.0 A/g, a decent capacity of 261.3 mAh/g can still be achieved, exhibiting excellent cycling stability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The visible light induced ferroelectric property for Pb(Zr0.53Ti0.47)O-3/La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (PZT/LSMO) film is investigated, and the temperature dependent ferroelectric responses is discovered. When temperature is lower than the metal-insulator transition temperature (T-MI) of LSMO, both of the remanent polarization and coercive field of PZT are significantly depressed by the laser irradiation, whereas they keep unchanged once temperature rises higher than T-MI. The temperature-dependent variation of ferroelectricity may be caused by photoinduced demagnetization in LSMO layer and photovoltage produced in the PZT/LSMO heterojunction. The optical modulation on ferroelectricity makes this heterojunction potential application in new ferroelectric devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Preparing CIGS thin films with grain size above 1 mu m based on quaternary CIGS target is difficult, which is a barrier for the further enhancement of CIGS cell efficiency. We proposed a two-stage method to overcome this problem. Cu-rich CIGS thin film was prepared from quaternary CIGS and Cu target and then converted into Cu-poor CIGS by depositing the In2Se3 layer on the Cu-rich CIGS with the subsequent annealing. CIGS absorbers with micrometer-sized crystal based on quaternary CIGS target was prepared. The influence of the In2Se3 deposition on the physical properties of the CIGS absorber and CIGS cells has been investigated. The thickness of In2Se3 layer has been optimized which can result in the highest conversion efficiency of 9.5% in Cu-rich CIGS based solar cells. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sub-micron phase N-Fe2O3 powders were synthesized by doping Mg, Cu and Zn, whilst varying the concentrations of Mg and Zn. We chose to prepare the compounds by the molten salt method: a simple and cost effective method that yields crystalline, chemically purified and single-phase powders under low temperatures. The N-Fe2O3 powders were characterised using X-ray diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy and surface area studies. Subsequently, the electrochemical properties of the N-Fe2O3 powders were investigated. Notably, the aforementioned tests showed the powders had a corundum structure; high density to surface area ratios; and high reversible capacities with low capacity fading after 50 charge-discharge cycles. Thus, sub-micron phase N-Fe2O3 are suitable anode material for Li-ion batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The KxWO3 nanorods with a broad optical absorbance in near infrared (NIR) region have been synthesized by a facile solvothermal reaction in this work. On the merits of this unique photoabsorption, KxWO3 nanorod exhibited an excellent photothermal conversion effect upon NIR 1064 nm laser excitation as evidenced by a rapid, distinct and recyclable photothermal effect both for KxWO3 powder and aqueous dispersion. Further, KxWO3 was finally proved to be an eligible phototherapeutic agent for antitumor treatment and great success has been made in in vitro cancer cell killing and in vivo elimination of solid tumor in living mice, manifesting a potential application prospect of KxWO3 nanorod as photothermal material.

AB In this study, a weight ratio of 50:30:20 of ZnO:CaO:P2O5 was calcined using microwave and conventional thermal treatment at 800 degrees C to synthesize zinc oxide calcium phosphorous oxide (ZCAP) ceramics. X-ray diffraction data indicated that microwave synthesized ZCAP ceramics was less crystalline than conventionally synthesized ZCAP. Micro-Raman spectroscopy and FTIR confirmed the presence of ZnO, phosphate and carbonate groups in both heat treatment methods. The reported TGA-DSC results demonstrated that carbonate amount was very less (approx. 0.1%) in microwave synthesized ZCAP while in comparison to carbonate amount was high (approx. 0.69%) in conventionally prepared ZCAP. FESEM image analysis showed that particle sizes were comparatively smaller for microwave synthesized ZCAP than conventionally synthesized ZCAP. Hence, microwave calcinations of ZnO, CaO and P2O5 is a promising method to synthesize ZCAP ceramics compared to conventional thermal calcination treatment. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID GAS SENSORS
AB A hydrogen sensor has been proposed by coating Pd nanoparticles-PMMA composite organic sol on silica microfiber independent on any expensive or complex chemical process. The thickness of cladding layer and the diameter of elaborated microfiber were determined as similar to 20 mu m and similar to 57.93 mu m, respectively. Due to the evanescent wave excited by silica microfiber and the amorphous structure of PMMA film, the Pd nanoparticles effectively absorbed the hydrogen molecules and resulted in the shift of resonance wavelength. The experimental results match well with an exponential curve with an average sensitivity of 5.58 nm/%, which is comparable to other electrochemical hydrogen sensors reported recently.

AB The present study focused on the synthesis of hollow zirconia sub-microspheres through simple one-pot hydrothermal approach. First, autoclaving zirconyl chloride octahydrate as the oxide precursor and glucose monohydrate as the sacrificial template together at 180 degrees C for 20 h resulted in an in-situ formation of core@shell composite. Thereafter, calcination of the composite at 550 degrees C for 4 h was lead to the removal of the template and the formation of the hollow spheres. Results inferred from the XRD, TEM, SEM and IR analysis revealed that hollow zirconia sub-microspheres were readily produced with diameter approximately of 400 nm and the walls of the hollow spheres composed of ZrO2 nanocrystalline particles with a size of 8 nm.

AB A series of 2,6-diarylethene-4H-pyran-4-one organic functional materials (pp-s) were designed and successfully synthesized, characterized by PL spectra. It was found that all of them displayed the aggregation induced emission enhancement (AIEE) phenomenon, and three of them presented different emission spectra in different solvents i.e. solvatochromism, which was confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculation on the ICT process. Remarkably, an inverted U-shaped mechanochromic behavior (MFC) and red-shifted phenomenon of their emission spectra (bathochromism) was observed along with the increasing of conjugation degree. In which, the compound containing triphenylamine units (pp-3) showcasing the best MFC nature. PXRD profiles indicated the transformation between two different crystalline states upon grinding. Thus, we offer a way to manipulate the chromism performance via conjugation-regulating strategy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel porous and magnetic Fe/FeNx composite fibers for Cr (VI) ions adsorbent were prepared by electro-blown spinning technology coupled with high temperature nitrided way. The X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry-Thermo Gravimetric Analyzer (DSC-TGA) revealed metallic iron and FeNx mainly existed in these fibers. Furthermore, the effect of spinning voltage, air pressure and solution concentration on the morphology for the as-spun fibers were investigated. Meanwhile, the effect of calcination temperature on morphology and structure, crystalline property and hysteresis loop also were discussed. The obtained fibers had a uniform morphology and structure, and a high specific surface area (151 m(2) g(-1)) during the calcination temperature of 800 degrees C. The Fe/FeNx fibers showed effective sorption affinity for Cr (VI) ions, achieving maximum adsorption capacities of 79.21 mg/g at 25 degrees C. It mainly was ascribed to the existence of metallic iron in the obtained fibers. Meanwhile, the FeNx contents in the fibers were extremely beneficial to the adsorbent recovery. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Different from earlier researches, we study low frequency acoustic characteristics of mesophase pitch based carbon foams by impedance tube, and prove that carbon foams has low frequency absorption characteristics besides the application of thermal insulation and foreign matter adsorption. Three different samples are made of three asphalt raw materials: PNJ, PTZ and PDD. By carbonation and graphitization of the asphalt foam, different samples are prepared and corresponding sound absorption experiments display the porosity, density and micropore size of samples have a strong relationship with sound absorption capacity; increasing thickness of samples could heighten low frequency sound absorption coefficient, but increasement of back cavity would has almost no effects on low frequency. Combined with SEM images, the large porous microstructure with layered distribution is beneficial to absorption coefficient improvement of porosity material. This research shows carbon foams to be as the porous lightweight materials has a potential application in acoustics field, mechanism analysis in this research provides guidelines for design of sound absorption material having a microstructure porosity properties.

AB (0 0 1) Co(2)Z filled random Co(2)Z powders were synthesized via a two-step method, which was mixed in a organics matrix of tape cast to investigate the electromagnetic (EM) wave absorption properties in a wide frequency region. The results suggest that in comparison with the commonly random Co(2)Z powder, (0 0 1) Co(2)Z filled random Co(2)Z powder exhibits significantly enhanced EM wave absorption properties in terms of both the maximum reflection loss and absorption bandwidth.

AB We deposited polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) microporous membrane on the surface of palladium loaded tin dioxide (Pd-SnO2) gas-sensitive film by phase separation to reduce the sensitivity loss of Pd-SnO2 gas-sensitive film at high humidity. The sensitivity loss of the PVDF-Pd-SnO2 gas-sensitive film to 50 ppm H-2 at 100 RH% is 22% which is almost one-third of the Pd-SnO2 film (70%). At 100 RH%, the sensitivity loss of Pd-SnO2 film is direct proportional to the H-2 concentration, but it become inversely after PVDF microporous membrane deposition. PVDF microporous membrane significantly improved the stability of Pd-SnO2 film under high humidity, and verified the feasibility of non-conductive polymer materials improving the performance of gas-sensitive materials.

AB Enhancing the performance of individual micro/nanowires based room temperature gas sensors is a big challenge for real-time detection of toxic gases. In this work, we developed a surface etching method to increase the sensitivity of individual ZnO microwire (MW) based gas sensor. The etching of the MW increases the adsorption sites for gas molecules on it by increasing the specific surface area and the surface density of single ionized oxygen vacancies. This leads to a similar to 20-fold increase of the gas sensor's sensitivity. When working under 148.8 mu W cm(-2) of UV light, the sensitivity is further increased to 411%. Meanwhile, the response and the recovery time decreases to similar to 20% and similar to 2% of the values in dark condition, respectively. As a result, the individual ZnO microwire based gas sensor's performance was greatly enhanced, and it has great potential to be used as a room temperature gas sensor towards NO2.

AB In this paper, Cu2O films were prepared by an anodisation method in 1.0 wt% NH3N2O electrolyte. The influence of preparation conditions on photoelectrochemical properties was investigated. Results show that anodisation voltage and reaction time exerted significant influence on semiconductor types and photocurrent values. Only under the conditions of appropriate voltage and time could n-Cu2O films be prepared. When the voltage was 10 V and anodisation time was 30 to 90 min, the films had a larger oxidation photocurrent (n-type semiconductor), with a current density of -101 mu A/cm(2) to -143 mu A/cm(2). The reasons for formation of n-Cu2O films have been discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved.

AB Restructured B/F codoped carbon nitride (r-CN-B/F) with enhanced photocatalytic H-2 evolution was prepared by post-thermal treatment of B/F codoped carbon nitride (CN-B/F), which is obtained from direct condensation doping using ionic liquid as doping dopant. Characterization results show that B and F doped in the skeleton and surface layer of CN material respectively. It is found that the post-annealing strategy makes for compact interlayer accumulation and large surface area for doped CN. In particular, decreased surface graphitic carbon, increased B doping content and optimized conjugate aromatic ring structure of catalyst after post-sintering treatment are favorable for the photo-generated charge transfer and separation, thereby, the photocatalytic H-2 production of r-CN-B/F was much enhanced. This study demonstrates a facile way for optimizing the polymeric structure of heteroatom doped semiconductor materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SnO2 QDs were prepared in the presence of g-C3N4 NLs and the average crystallite size of SnO2 QDs was achieved below 3 nm. The interactions between both SnO2 QDs and g-C3N4 NLs are strong, as established by differences in binding energies. The sunlight driven photocatalytic activity of SnO2-g-C3N4 composite was carried out by the degradation of methyl orange (MO) and it shows 94% degradation under sunlight within 180 min. The improved photocatalytic activity under sunlight is attributed to the synergetic effect of SnO2 QDs and layered g-C3N4. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Yttrium-doped BaZrO3 powders have been synthesized by sol-gel method. Powder XRD confirms that BaZr1-xYxO3-delta (X = 0.00, 0.05, 0.10) crystallize with the perovskite-type unit cell (space group Pm (3) over barm). The effects of doping and hydration on the band gap of BaZr1-xYxO3-delta have been evaluated through the analysis of the diffuse reflection spectra. An additional absorption band is observed near the fundamental absorption edge in the doped samples annealed in dry oxygen. These findings are explained by the impact of defects on O(2p)-Zr(4d) charge transfer transitions and by trapping of electrons by oxygen vacancies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Ti-based bulk metallic glass Ti47Cu38Zr7.5Fe2.5Sn2Si1Ag2 was fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM). The crystalline phases in the gas-atomized powder disappear after additive manufacturing and the SLM parts are fully glassy. All SLM samples reach a high relative density above 98.5% and a high compressive strength around 1700 MPa despite failing prematurely in comparison with as-cast rods. Our work identifies a Ti-based glass-forming alloy suitable for laser-based additive manufacturing and opens up new vistas for overcoming the intrinsic limitations of Ti-based BMGs in terms of size and geometry and for making them accessible to (biomedical) applications.

AB A series of tetra substituted phthalocyanines bearing 2-mercaptobenzimidazole or 2-mercaptobenzothiazole units With different central metals (Zn and In) were synthesized. Their photo physical properties including the parameters of fluorescence and triplet state were studied. The benzothiazole substituted phthalocyanines exhibit stronger third-order nonlinear optical properties (NLO) absorption effects, higher triplet quantum yield (Phi(T)) and faster intersystem crossing rate compared to the benzimidazole substituted phthalocyanines. With the same central metals, benzothiazole substituted phthalocyanine complexes have the lower fluorescence quantum yield (Phi(F)), the higher triplet quantum yield (Phi(T)) and the larger third-order NLO properties as a result of larger conjugated structure and spin orbit coupling induced by sulphur atoms. The influences of the central metal atoms and the peripheral substituents on the third-order NLO properties are discussed using photophysical parameters. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of post-annealing atmospheres (air and Ar-H-2) on the optical properties of La2-xYxSiO5 (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2) co-doped Pr-0.25(3+) and Dy-0.25(3+) powder phosphors were studied. The X-ray diffraction patterns showed that the as-prepared samples have higher full width at half maximum (FWHM) than the annealed samples. The elemental composition, oxidation states, and chemical and electronic states of the phosphors were determined using the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The band gap values determined from the diffuse reflectance spectra were shown to increase following the post-annealing treatments (with the values increasing in the following manner: Ar-H-2-annealed > air-annealed > as prepared). The photoluminescence intensities of the phosphors also followed the same trend as the band gap values. Two different cases of the photoluminescence mechanisms were proposed for the La2-xYxSiO5:Pr-0.25(3+),0.25DY3+ phosphors. Case 1: The 4f5d energy level of Pr3+ lies within the band gap of the host and energy transfer was observed from Pr3+ to Dy3+ via the overlapping 4f5d emission peak of PO+ and the I-4(15/2) excitation peak of Dy3+. Case II: The 4f5d energy level of Pr3+ lies close or inside the conduction band of the host and the energy transfer was not observed from Pr3+ to Dy3+. The CIE colour coordinates of the phosphors showed tunable emission colours (blue, red and white). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It can be efficiently excited by blue light of GaN chips, the cold white light of GaN-based LEDs using only Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ (YAG:Ce, 7.0 wt% in silicone) as phosphors can become warmer when it was blended in. When blending concentrations were 0.1 wt% and 0.2 wt%, the cold white light became neutral white light, the correlated color temperature (CCT) decreased from 6157 K to 524010, then to 4043 K, the color rendering index (CRI) changed from 72.7 to 81.3, then to 78.6, the luminous efficiency (no changed from 134.1 lm.w(-1) to 61.9 lm.w(-1), then to 46.3 lm.w(-1), the Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates changed from (0.32, 0.33) to (0.34, 0.33), then to (038, 0.36). At 0.3 wt%, the light became warm white light, the corresponding CCT was 3475 K, CRI was 75.6, eta(L) was 36.9 lm.w(-1), and CIE value was (0.41, 0.40). The results suggest the coordination polymer is a promising red-emitting phosphor candidate for neutral and warm white LEDs, especially for warm white LEDs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The samples of Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) have been implanted with 500 keV C+-ions at different ion fluences ranging from 93 x 10(13) to 8.4 x 10(14) ions/cm(2). The structural modifications are examined by Fourier Transform Infrared and Raman spectral studies. For the investigation of optical, electrical and surface morphological properties of implanted samples UV Visible spectrometer, four probe apparatus and optical microscope have been employed. The FTIR spectra confirmed the cleavage of chemicals bonds as a consequence of polymer chain scission, whereas, Raman studies revealed the transformation of PMMA structure into quasi-continuous amorphous carbon with increasing ion fluences. A continuous reduction has been observed in the optical band gap of PMMA from 3.16 to 1.42 eV. Moreover, the refractive index, extinction coefficient and electrical conductivity of implanted PMMA are found to be an increasing function of the ion fluence. The micrographic images revealed the signatures of ion-induced defects like cracking, dehydrogenation, stress and swelling on the surface of PMMA. These implanted samples have a potential to be used in the field of optical communications and thin plastic flexible electronics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is shown experimentally that in photo-thermo-refractive glasses the transformation of charged silver subnanosized molecular clusters to neutral state by UV irradiation results in the increase of glass refractive index. The increment of the refractive index reaches Delta n = 0.76. 10(-4). Computer simulation has shown that the polarizability of neutral molecular clusters is by 20-40% larger than of charged ones. The reason of this is the increase of electron density and volume of electron density surfaces during the transformation of molecular cluster to the neutral state. The transition molecular cluster from the ground state to the excited state also results in the increase of its polarizability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peculiarities of the polarization holographic recording in the samples with the films of copolymer poly[4-((2-nitrophenyl)diazenyl)phenylmethacrylate-co-octylmethacrylate] with free surface and in the sandwich-structures with solid covering layer are investigated. Time of the holographic recording and its storage is less in the sandwich-structures. It was concluded, that in the sandwich-structures, geometric relief of the film surface does not appear during the recording. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The photoluminescence characteristics of praseodymium (Pr3+) doped zirconia/polyethylene glycol (ZrO2/PEG) samples were studied using optical absorption and emission spectra. The optical properties were theoretically analysed using standard and modified Judd-Ofelt (J-O) models. The oscillator strength of the observed transitions and J-O intensity parameters were calculated using these J-O models. The radiative properties such as radiative transition probability (A(T)), branching ratio (beta(R)), stimulated emission cross-section (sigma(e)) and gain band width (sigma(e) x Delta lambda(eff)) for the excited states of Pr3+ in ZrO2/PEG composite have been determined. The experimental branching ratios obtained from the emission spectra were compared with the theoretical values. The excitation spectra of Pr3+ doped samples show overlapping of Pr3+ excitation peak at 448 nm at the end of the broad excitation band of the host, indicating the charge transfer between the host and Pr3+ ions. Luminescence decay analysis confirmed concentration quenching in the prepared samples and the lifetime values are found to be in the microsecond range. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The need to utilize TiO2 based metal oxide hetero nanostructures for the degradation of environmental pollutants like Rhodamine B and reactive red 152 from the wastewater using stratified WO3/TiO2 catalyst under sunlight illumination. WO3, TiO2 and stratified WO3/TiO2 catalysts were prepared by a spray pyrolysis method. It was found that the stratified WO3/TiO2 heterostructure has high crystallinity, no mixed phase formation occurs, strong optical absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum, and large surface area. The photocatalytic activity was tested for degradation of Rhodamine B (Rh B) and reactive red 152 in an aqueous medium. TiO2 layer in stratified WO3/TiO2 catalyst helps to extend its absorption spectrum in the solar light region. Rh B and Reactive red 152is eliminated up to 98 and 94% within the 30 and 40 min respectively at optimum experimental condition by stratified WO3/TiO2. Moreover, stratified WO3/TiO2 photoelectrode has good stability and reusability than individual TiO2 and WO3 thin film in the degradation of Rh B and reactive red 152. The photoelectrocatalytic experimental results indicate that stratified WO3/TiO2 photoelectrode is a promising material for dye removal. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we present a residue-and-polymer-free graphene transfer method by using the adhesive force between graphene and a target substrate, the hydrophobic property of graphene, and the surface tension of the solutions. We used an n-type GaN substrate as the target substrate to make a photodiode (PD). Recently, the inclusion of biomolecules in photodetection technology has attracted considerable attention in the electronics and photonics research, particularly due to the rapid evolution of organic inorganic bio-hybrid PDs (Bio-HPDs). This report presents a significant photoresponse of the bioinspired graphene-based PD fabricated with deoxyribonucleic acid-cetyltrimetylammonium chloride (DNA-CTMA) biomolecules on the n-type GaN substrate. Bio-HPDs respond to the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet wavelengths. Moreover, the Bio-HPDs show photosensitivities (l(photo)/I-dark) of 21,143, and 1194 for infrared, visible, and ultraviolet wavebands, respectively, which can be attributed to the integration of high-mobility graphene and photosensitive DNA-CTMA biomolecules. In addition, the corresponding charge transfer mechanisms in the PDs are explained by energy band diagrams. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work presents the results of photoluminescence, excitation and radiative decay time for a ceramic system containing Mg2Al4Si5O18-Al2O3-MgAl2O4-SiO2 with Fe3+ and Cr3+ as impurity ions. Emission data were obtained using several excitation wavelengths and the excitation data were acquired for the most intense emission bands. The optical results were analyzed according to the Tanabe-Sugano (TS) theory from which the crystalline field parameter Dq and Racah parameters B and C were obtained for the Fe3+ and Cr3+ sites. The results indicate that the Fe3+ and Cr3+ ions occupy tetrahedral and octahedral sites, respectively. The emission from Fe3+ and Cr3+ ions causes an intense and broad band ranging between 350 nm and 850 nm, showing that this material is a potential tunable radiation source at room temperature.

AB Herein is presented a comparative performance analysis of heterojunction organic-based light-emitting field-effect transistors (OLEFETs) with symmetric (Au only) and asymmetric (Au and LiF/Al) electrode contacts. The devices had a top source drain contact with long-channel geometry and were produced by sequentially depositing p-type pentacene and n-type N,Ni-ditridecylperylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (P13) using a neutral cluster beam deposition apparatus. The spectroscopic, structural and morphological properties of the organic thin films were examined using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) method, laser scanning confocal and atomic force microscopy (LSCM, AFM). Based upon the growth of high-quality, well-packed crystalline thin films, the devices demonstrated ambipolar field-effect characteristics, stress-free operational stability, and light emission under ambient conditions. Various device parameters were derived from the fits of the observed characteristics. The hole mobilities were nearly equal irrespective of the electrode contacts, whereas the electron mobilities of the transistors with LiF/Al drain electrodes were higher due to the low injection barrier. For the OLEFETs with symmetric electrodes, electroluminescence (EL) occurred only in the vicinity of the hole injecting electrode, whereas for the OLEFETs with asymmetric electrodes, the emission occurred in the vicinity of both hole- and electron-injecting electrodes. By tuning the carrier injection and transport through high- and low-work function metals, the hole-electron recombination sites could be controlled. The operating conduction and light emission mechanism are discussed with the aid of EL images obtained using a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we propose a potential high efficiency Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)(4)/CdS (CZTS) solar cell design based on graded band-gap engineering that can offer the benefits of improved absorption behavior and reduced recombination effects. Moreover, a new hybrid approach based on analytical modeling and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed to determinate the optimal band-gap profile of the amended CZTS absorber layer to achieve further efficiency enhancement. It is found that the proposed design exhibits superior performance, where a high efficiency of 16.9% is recorded for the optimized solar cell with a relative improvement of 92%, compared with the reference cell efficiency of 8.8%. Likewise, the optimized CZTS solar cell with a graded band-gap enables achieving a higher open circuit voltage of 889 mV, a short-circuit current of 28.5 mA and a fill factor of 66%. Therefore, the optimized CZTS-based solar cell with graded-band gap paradigm pinpoints a new path toward recording high-efficiency thin-film solar cells through enhancing carrier collection and reducing the recombination rate.

AB Nanoparticles represent a promising platform for diagnostics and therapy of human diseases. For biomedical applications, these nanoparticles are usually coated with photosensitizers regularly activated in a spectral window of 530-700 nm. The emissions at 530 nm (green) and 660 nm (red) are of particular interest for imaging and photodynamic therapy, respectively. This work presents the Mg2SiO4:Et3+ system, produced by reverse strike co-precipitation, with up to 10% dopant and no secondary phase formation. These nanoparticles when excited at 985 nm show upconversion emission with peaks around 530 and 660 nm, although excitation at 808 nm leads to only a single emission peak at around 530 nm. The direct upconversion of this biomaterial without a co-dopant, and its tunability by the excitation source, renders Mg2SiO4:Er3+ nanoparticles a promising system for biomedical applications.

AB In rapidly changing regional economies, less innovative European regions (henceforth referred to as lagging behind regions) must actively work to reduce the gap between them and knowledge-intensive regions. Recent literature has stressed that the lack of efficient institutional settings reduces the opportunities of local knowledge spillover and increases the need for local organisations to exploit collaborative networks to better support their innovation performance. In this light, since increasing attention has recently been directed at the role of inter-regional collaborations, we have measured the capacity of local innovative organisations embedded in lagging behind European regions to develop internal and external regional inventors' networks by exploring their collaborative patenting processes. Then, a seven-year panel dataset (2002-2008) was organised using patents data at a regional level to validate the research hypothesis that collaborations, and specifically with highly innovative (knowledge-intensive) regions, positively affect the innovation performances of lagging-behind regions. Finally, the implications of EU policies for supporting lagging-behind regions are discussed.

ID PEOPLES SCIENCE MOVEMENT; POLITICS; GLOBALIZATION; TECHNOLOGY; GROWTH
AB The concept of 'inclusive innovation' for development has become increasingly prominent in both academic and policy discourses, raising important questions as to how this is being framed. Results from case studies conducted in India suggest inclusive innovation to be interpretively flexible and. contested. One case presents a grassroots framing emphasising social and political empowerment, rooted in community self-sufficiency, autonomy and traditional belief systems. In contrast, the other cases co-opt the language of inclusion to present a predominantly market-based framing, heavily emphasising market readiness and participation. This framing is transforming rural social practices (including the organisation of space and time, the meaning of production and the role of women), introducing the potential for market dependency.

AB The paper critically reviews the work of David Collingridge in the light of contemporary concerns about responsibility and accountability in innovation, public engagement with science and technology, and the role of scientific expertise in technology policy. Given continued interest in his thoughts on the 'social control of technology', and the 'dilemma of control', this attention is both timely and overdue. The paper illuminates a mismatch between the prevalence of citations to Collingridge's work on the dilemma of control in the literature on responsible innovation, and the depth of engagement with his arguments. By considering neglected aspects of Collingridge's substantive, methodological and philosophical analysis, important implications can be drawn for theory and practice relating to the governance of innovation and co-evolution between technology and society. The paper helps to improve understandings of wider political contexts for responsible innovation, especially in relation to anticipatory, participatory and institutional aspects of governance.

AB This paper analyses how knowledge-based practices adopted by innovation intermediaries enable them to generate value for themselves when collaborating with their clients. While the literature focuses on value creation for their client organisations, little is known about how innovation intermediaries create internal value even though this is essential for ensuring their long-term survival and sustaining their key facilitating role in the innovation system. This understudied issue is explored using empirical evidence from a sub-set of innovation intermediaries, Research and Technology Organisations (RTOs). The results indicate that by capitalising on existing knowledge vested in employees and collaborators as well as understanding and shaping the knowledge base of the innovation ecosystem, innovation intermediaries generate internal value from their involvement in collaborative innovation, which range from different financial to non-financial types of value. Implications for intermediaries, their collaborators and for policymakers are then discussed.

AB In the UK, higher education is increasingly a marketised service sharing many characteristics with other professional services such as legal, medical or financial services. With marketisation comes competition, and the need for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to develop and maintain strong programmes to attract and retain high-class faculty and fee-paying students. Here, we consider the drivers of programme innovation i.e. the introduction of new programmes and the withdrawal of existing programmes in UK universities. Our focus is on undergraduate programmes as these account for three-quarters of all student enrolments. Using panel data for UK universities we identify significant resource, internationalisation and business engagement effects. Financial stringency and more extensive international market engagement both encourage programme introduction. Collaboration with businesses has offsetting effects depending on the nature of the interaction. The results have both strategic and systemic implications.

AB Strategic alliances are important channels for interfirm learning, especially for small firms that are resource constrained. Of the several alliance attributes, technological distance between partners (measured as the distance between partners' innovative outcomes) is shown to have a significant influence on the learning benefits from strategic alliances. Drawing upon the theory of recombination, our study argues that the influence" of technological distance on learning is best understood by not only measuring the distance between innovative outcomes, but by also taking into consideration the knowledge elements underlying the innovative outcomes. We develop a concept of knowledge base homogeneity that captures the extent to which the innovative outcomes of partnering firms draw upon similar sets of knowledge elements. Using patent and alliance data from 201 small biotechnology firms during the period 1996-2010, we confirm that the technological distance has an inverted u-shaped relationship on interfirm learning. We further demonstrate that this u-shaped relationship is moderated by the knowledge base homogeneity between partners, such that benefits of technological distance are enhanced and the costs of technological distance are mitigated when the knowledge base homogeneity between alliance partners is high. The results have important implications for interfirm learning, especially in the context of small firms that are limited in their knowledge stocks.

The purpose of "this paper is to show that serendipity can come in different forms and come about in a variety of ways. The archives of Robert K Merton, who introduced the term to the social sciences, were used as a starting point for gathering literature and examples. I identify four types of serendipity (Walpolian, Mertonian, Bushian, Stephanian) together with four mechanisms of serendipity (Theory-led, Observer-led, Error-borne, Network-emergent). I also discuss implications of the different types and mechanisms for theory and policy.

AB We examine the determinants of firms' innovation success, using the firm-level data from the Japanese National Innovation Survey. We focus on the relationship between organizational and human resource management practices for research and development (R & D) and product/process innovation. We find that interdivisional cooperation/teams and the creation/relocation/integration of R & D centers are positively associated with both product and process innovation. Having board members with an R & D background is positively associated with product innovation, implying that top-down R & D decision-making may be important for firms to introduce new products. Among the factors examined, personnel assessment reflecting R & D outcomes appears to have an especially strong relationship with product innovation. Moreover, the positive relationship between the creation/relocation/integration of R & D centers and innovation success suggests that drastic organizational changes can work as a clear signal of firms' determination to pursue an innovation-oriented strategy and help to accelerate innovation success.

AB The use of external knowledge for innovation (i.e., inbound or outside-in open innovation) has received substantial attention in the innovation literature, However, the "human side" of open innovation is still poorly understood. We consider the role of employee characteristics with respect to predicting firm-level openness. Drawing on the human capital, learning and creativity literatures, we theorize that knowledge diversity of the firm's employees is positively associated with employees' ability to identify and absorb external knowledge, which aggregates to increased firm-level openness that is, firms' use of external knowledge in their pursuit of innovation. Based on a combination of three data sources, namely, two survey data sources and register data, we find support for our hypothesis that employees' educational diversity is positively associated with firm-level openness. However, we find no direct association between employees' work history diversity and firm-level openness but rather as also hypothesized a conditional relationship based on educational background, which implies that diverse work history only has a positive impact at higher levels of educational diversity. To reduce endogeneity concerns, we undertake a series of robustness checks.

AB How does Internet use affect well-being? This paper presents a survey of the literature investigating this question, and it develops a framework to analyze both positive effects and potential risks. We point out four distinct channels through which Internet can shape well-being: it changes time use patterns, creates new activities, facilitates access to information, and acts as powerful communication tool. We show how these four channels impact well-being in distinct domains of life. A central point emerging from the literature review is that the effects of Internet on well-being are mediated by a set of personal characteristics that are specific to each individual: psychological functioning, capabilities, and framing conditions (culture and beliefs). Hence, it is the interaction between human beings' activities in distinct domains of life and their own personal characteristics that explains why the use of Internet has stronger positive effects for some individuals and social groups than others.

AB Background: Bronchial hypersecretion is a poorly studied symptom in asthma. The aim of the study was to determine the specific characteristics of asthmatics with bronchial hypersecretion.
   Methods: A total of 142 asthmatics (21.8% men; mean age 49.8 years) were prospectively followed for one year. Mucus hypersecretion was clinically classified into two severity categories: daily sputum production and frequent expectoration but not every day. Clinical and pulmonary function variables associated with mucus hypersecretion were assessed by multiple logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Daily cough was recorded in 28.9% of patients and sputum production daily or most of the days in 52.1%. Patients with mucus hypersecretion had more dyspnoea, poorer asthma control and quality of life, had suffered from more exacerbations and showed anosmia associated with chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis more frequently. Factors associated to mucus hypersecretion were anosmia, one exacerbation or more in the previous year and FEV1/ FVC < 70% (AUC 0.75, 95% CI 0.66-0.85) for the first definition of hypersecretion, and anosmia, poor asthma control and age (AUC 0.75, 95% CI 0.67-0.83) for the second definition.
   Conclusions: Mucus hypersecretion is frequent in patients with asthma, and is associated with chronic upper airways disease, airway obstruction, poor asthma control and more exacerbations.

AB Background: This Danish study evaluated the association between psychiatric comorbidity and the course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer and tuberculosis (TB) of an entire nation.
   Methods: Data from the Danish National Patient Registry (1998-2009), material status, gender, educational level, comorbidities, age at diagnosis and death, medication, and causes of death were extracted from national databases. We identified 71,874 patients with COPD and found 32,282 with a pre-index psychiatric comorbidity, 20,787 patients with lung cancer and found 8406 with a pre-index psychiatric comorbidity, and 3495 patients with TB and found 797 with a pre-index psychiatric morbidity. Within the three groups we compared the patients with/without a pre-index psychiatric comorbidity.
   Results: We found a reduced survival in patients with COPD or TB and a pre-existing psychiatric comorbidity. For all three pulmonary diseases, we found significantly higher age (p < .001) at time of diagnosis, higher Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index (p < .001), and an overrepresentation of singles (p < .001) in patients with a psychiatric comorbidity. COPD and lung cancer patients with a psychiatric comorbidity were significantly overrepresented by women (p < .001). Patients with COPD and a psychiatric comorbidity died most frequently of lung cancer (24%). Advancing age and Deyo-Charlson index were associated with a higher mortality rate whereas being a woman and married/co-habiting yielded a lower mortality rate for patients with a psychiatric comorbidity.
   Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first epidemiological study investigating the influence of a psychiatric comorbidity on the course of COPD, lung cancer and TB at a national level. Our results emphasize the importance of detecting these major respiratory diseases in patients with psychiatric comorbidities and intensifying the treatment and follow up of these patients.

AB Background: Epidemiologic studies have found an association between sleep duration and obesity. However, the relationship between sleep duration and metabolic body size phenotype in children and adolescents remains unknown.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 3650 participants (1946 boys and 1704 girls) from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2012 were classified into four phenotypes according to body mass index and metabolic heath status based on the definition of metabolic syndrome by NCEP-ATP III or the International Diabetes Federation. The four phenotypes were: metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW), metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW), metabolically healthy overweight (MHO), and metabolically unhealthy overweight (MUO). The associations between the four metabolic body size phenotypes and sleep duration, categorized as very short (<= 5 h), short (6-7 h), normal (8-10 h), or long (>= 11 h), were evaluated.
   Results: Sleep duration was shorter in the MUO group (7.0 +/- 1.5 h) than in the MHNW (7.3 +/- 1.4 h) or MUNW (7.8 +/- 1.6 h) groups. After adjusting for age, sex, household income, and physical activity, compared with a normal sleep duration, very short sleep duration (<= 5 h) was associated with a higher prevalence of being overweight/obese (26.4% vs 17.4%, p = 0.001), lower risk of being MHNW (0.711 (0.538-.940), p = 0.017) or MUNW (0.478 (0.237-.962), p = 0.039), and higher risk of being MHO (1.702 (1.193-.428), p = 0.003). By contrast, long sleep duration (>= 11 h) was associated with a higher risk of being MUNW (2.581 (1.124-.928), p = 0.025).
   Conclusions: Sleep duration may be independently associated with metabolic body size phenotype in children and adolescents. (C 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To determine the frequency of sleep breathing disorders in multiple systemic atrophy (MSA, combining Parkinsonism, cerebellar syndrome, and dysautonomia) and evaluate the benefit/tolerance of various modes of ventilation.
   Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 45 patients with MSA having undergone a videopolysomnography. Their sleep characteristics were compared to those of 45 patients with Parkinson's disease and 45 healthy controls, matched for age and sex. Patients with MSA received fixed continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) when stridor was isolated, auto-adjusting CPAP when it was combined with obstructive sleep apnea, and adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) when combined with central sleep apnea.
   Results: Higher periodic leg movements index and more frequent REM sleep behavior disorder were observed in MSA patients, compared to patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls. In MSA, 28/45 (62.2%) patients had sleep breathing disorders, including (overlapping samples) stridor (n = 17, 38%), obstructive sleep apnea (n = 14, 31%), central sleep apnea (n = 4, 9%), and ataxic breathing (n = 1). Except for three initial refusals and two yet untreated patients, fixed CPAP (n = 9), auto-adjusting CPAP (n = 8) and ASV (n = 2) were well-tolerated (limited leaks and good compliance) and successfully controlled stridor plus sleep apnea. Treated patients had survival times similar to those of patients without any sleep breathing disorder.
   Conclusion: In this small group, tailored management of stridor in MSA as an independent issue or combined with obstructive and central sleep apnea, yields a survival similar to survival in patients without sleep breathing disorders. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rock bream iridovirus (RBIV) causes severe mass mortalities in rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus) in Korea. In this study, we investigated the potential of viral membrane protein to induce antiviral status protecting rock bream against RBIV infection. We found that fish administered with ORF008L (myristoylated membrane protein, MMP) vaccine exhibited significantly higher levels of survival compared to ORF007L (major capsid protein, MCP). Moreover, ORF008L-based DNA vaccinated fish showed significant protection at 4 and 8 weeks post vaccination (wpv) than non-vaccinated fish after infected with RBIV (6. 7 x 10(5)) at 23 degrees C, with relative percent survival (RPS) of 73.36% and 46.72%, respectively. All of the survivors from the first RBIV infection were strongly protected (100% RPS) from re-infected with RBIV (1.1 x 10(7)) at 100 dpi. In addition, the MMP (ORF008L)-based DNA vaccine significantly induced the gene expression of TLR3 (14.2-fold), MyD88 (11.6-fold), Mx (84.7-fold), ISG15 (8.7-fold), PKR (25.6-fold), MHC class I (133-fold), Fas (6.7-fold), Fas ligand (6.7-fold), caspase9 (17.0-fold) and caspase3 (15.3-fold) at 7 days post vaccination in the muscle (vaccine injection site). Our results showed the induction of immune responses and suggest the possibility of developing preventive measures against RBIV using myristoylated membrane protein -based DNA vaccine.

AB To eliminate the problems associated with the use of extraneous adjuvants we have designed a Self Assembling Protein Nanoparticle (SAPN) containing epitopes from the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) (designated FMP014) and portions of the TLR5 agonist flagellin (designated FMP014(D0D1)) as an intrinsic adjuvant. By combining different molar ratios of FMP014 to FMP014(D0D1) monomers before self-assembly, we generated multiple nanoparticles and investigated their biophysical characteristics, immunogenicity and protective efficacy. Immunization with the construct formulated with the ratio 58:2 of FMP014 to FMP014(D0D1) had the highest protective efficacy against a challenge with a transgenic P. berghei sporozoite expressing PfCSP. Increasing the proportion of flagellin per particle resulted in an inverse relationship with levels of both antibody titers and protection. The cytokine profiles of the various immunization groups were evaluated and quantitative amounts of the cytokines IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL -12/p70 (Th1); IL4, IL5 (Th2); TNF-alpha, IL1 beta, IL-6, KC/GRO (pro-inflammatory), and IL-10 (immunomodulatory) were measured. The relationship of the cytokines to each other revealed a strong immunomodulatory effect depending on the proportion of flagellin in the construct. Our results demonstrate that SAPNs with flagellin may be a promising strategy for the development and delivery of a safe vaccine for infectious diseases. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The environmental risks of carbon nanotubes have received considerable attention. In this work, the effects of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on the adsorption of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) by riverine sediment and the transport of SDBS in sediment were studied. MWCNTs could significantly increase the adsorption capacity of the sediment for SDBS, thus affecting the transport of SDBS in sediment. Maximum adsorption capacity of the sediment for SDBS increases from 2.29 to 2.99 mg/g with the increasing content of MWCNTs from 0% to 1.5%. Breakthrough curves (BTCs) of SDBS obtained from the column experiments were described by the convection-dispersion equation, Thomas model, and Yan model. The estimated retardation factor R increases with the incorporation of MWCNTs, either in water or sediment. Additionally, the value of R is well correlated to the content of MWCNTs in sediment. Compared with Thomas model, Yan model is more suitable for fitting the BTCs with all the values of R-2 >= 0.951, but it tends to overestimate the maximum adsorption capacity when the content of MWCNTs in sediment is relatively higher. The results of SDBS retention in sediment indicate that MWCNTs can increase the accumulation of SDBS in the top sediment layer, while they can impede the transport of SDBS into deeper sediment layer when incorporated into the sediment. These effects should be taken into consideration for risk assessment of CNTs in the aquatic environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the mechanisms of solute transfer across the sediment-water interface plays a crucial role in water quality prediction and management. In this study, different arranged particles are used to form typical rough and permeable beds. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is used to model the solute transfer from the overlying water to sediment beds. Three rough wall turbulence regimes, i.e., smooth, transitional and rough regime, are separately considered and the effects of bed roughness on solute transfer are quantitatively analyzed. Results show that the classic laws related to Schmidt numbers can well reflect the solute transfer under the smooth regime with small roughness Reynolds numbers. Under the transitional regime, the solute transfer coefficient (K-L(+)) is enhanced and the effect of Schmidt number is weakened by increasing roughness Reynolds number. Under the rough regime, the solute transfer is suppressed by the transition layer (Brinkman layer) and controlled by the bed permeability. Moreover, it is found that water depth, friction velocity and bed permeability can be used to estimate the solute transfer velocity (K-L) under the completely rough regime. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Reliable modelling of sulfide and methane production in sewer systems is required for efficient sewer emission management. Wastewater compositions affect sulfide and methane production kinetics through both its short-term variation influencing the substrate availability to sewer biofilms, and its long-term variation affecting the sewer biofilm structure. While the short-term effect is well considered in existing sewer models with the use of Monad or half-order equations, the long-term effect has not been explicitly considered in current sewer models suitable for network modelling. In this study, the long-term effect of wastewater compositions on sulfide and methane production activities in rising main sewers was investigated. A detailed biofilm model was firstly developed, and then calibrated and validated using experimental data measured during the entire biofilm development period of a laboratory sewer reactor. Based on scenario simulations using the detailed biofilm model, empirical equations describing the long-term effect of sulfate and 5COD (soluble chemical oxygen demand) concentrations on k(H2S) (the maximum sulfide production rate of sewer biofilm) and k(CH4) (the maximum methane production rate of sewer biofilm) were proposed. These equations require further verification in future studies before their potential integration into network-wide sewer models. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Electro-dewatering (EDW) is an alternative emerging and energy-efficient technology that provides improved liquid/solids separations in the dewatering of wastewater sludge. The EDW technology is not only an innovative dewatering method for significantly reducing the volume of wastewater sludge before re-utilization or disposal, but is also a promising emerging method which may potentially be used for decontamination purposes. In this study, the influence of the sludge properties (e.g. electrical conductivity, zeta potential, specific cake resistance, among others) on their mechanical and electrical behaviour in terms of dewaterability and electro-dewaterability, the applied current (current density from 20 to 80 A/m(2)), and filter cloth position relative to the electrode was investigated. A two-sided filter press at lab scale with moving anode was used, and the treatment performance of the EDW process on two different types of wastewater sludge (activated and digested) was thoroughly assessed from both an electrochemical viewpoint and in terms of the dewatering rate. The results showed that the conditioned digested sludge was more easily dewatered by mechanical dewatering (MDW) with 34-35% (w%) of dry solids content compared to 19-20% (w%) for the activated sludge, thanks to the lower content of both the microbial extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and the volatile suspended solids fraction.
   For the EDW results, the electrical conductivity of the sludge was pivotal to the dryness of the final solids and therefore also to the dewatering kinetics. The results demonstrated that the activated sludge arrived at an equilibrium much faster (after approximately 3600 s) compared with digested sludge, thanks to its lower electrical conductivity (0.8 mS/cm) providing a greater voltage drop across the cathode and therefore more repulsion of the solids from the cathode leading to continuously high filtrate flowrate. Also the EDW performance was analysed by comparing the ratio of the filtrate volume collected at the anode to the volume collected at the cathode side. For digested sludge at 5 bar, 40 A/m(2) different positions of the filter cloth were tested but these configurations barely impacted the EDW performance, despite having a significant impact on the energy requirements. At industrial scale, it would be useful to position the filter cloths at some distance from the electrodes, but this study shows that this benefit may be quickly outweighed by the loss in EDW energy efficiency.

AB The feasibility of using Fe-0/S2O82- conditioning (zero valence iron (ZVI)/persulfate (ps)) integrated with horizontal electro-dewatering (HED) to improve the dewaterability of activated sludge (AS) was evaluated. The removal and migration of free and bound water in the ZVI/ps-HED process were determined, along with the organic matter migration between the solid and liquid phases of AS biosolids. Results showed that the optimum conditioning dosages were determined as 0.35 g ZVI/g dry solids (DS) and 0.15 g ps/g DS on the basis of capillary suction time variation. The lowest final water content (WC) of 83.67% in AS occurred after the HED treatment at 40 V and 120 min as determined using the response surface methodology. Despite the disruption of AS flocs and microbial cells through SO4-center dot oxidation during the ZVI/ps conditioning, the particle size and mass fractal dimension of the AS flocs remained relatively stable as the zeta potential increased from -8.5 mV to -4.6 my. The coagulation of Fe3+ from the oxidation of Fe2+ by ps contributed to the relatively stable condition, which favored the subsequent momentum of the electroosmotic flow. Moreover, the ZVI/ps conditioning decreased the bound water content (BWC, from 1.83 g/g DS to 1.38 g/g DS) and increased the free water content (FWC, from 60.27 g/g DS to 60.91 g/g DS), indicating a transformation from free water to bound water. After the ZVI/ps-HED process, the FWC and BWC were removed significantly with ratios of 96.32% and 79.78%, respectively. Along with water removal through the ZVI/ps-HED process, the organic matter in the supernatant/filtrate initially increased and further rose at the HED stage. The analysis of the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) content showed that the proteins (PNs) and polysaccharides (PSs) at the liquid and solid phases decreased due to oxidative degradation. Furthermore, the ZVI/ps stage significantly reduced the PNs content of slime to 57.22%, the PSs content of EPS to 68.50%, and the PN-like substances in the slime and tightly bound EPS to 74.90% and 52.47%, respectively. In addition, the WC of AS correlated with the contents of PN and microbial by-product-like material in slime, as well as tryptophan in TB-EPS, and the low EPS content in AS indicated good dewaterability. Thus, ZVI/ps should be selected as a pretreatment prior to HED. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Breakpoint chlorination can be commonly observed in the chlorination of water treatments when ammonia is present. In this study, it was found that breakpoint chlorination can remarkably eliminate a ubiquitous and chlorine-refractory micropollutant, carbamazepine (CBZ), with the removal of 72% at neutral condition. At neutral pH, low CBZ elimination was observed at a chlorine/ammonia molar ratio (Cl/N) of 1.0 and higher CBZ elimination was observed as Cl/N ratio increased from 1.0 to 1.6 (breakpoint), indicating that CBZ elimination was closely related to the generation and decomposition of chloramines. The chloramines generation and decomposition rates were affected by the pH, so that the CBZ elimination rate was highest at pH 7.0 and lower in acidic and basic solutions (pH 5.5 and pH 9.5, respectively). The CBZ elimination at pH 7.0 was 72.4% after 10 min of breakpoint chlorination, while reaction times about 30 min and 60 min were required to achieve the same elimination at pH 5.5 and pH 9.5, respectively. Breakpoint chlorination of CBZ was strongly suppressed by radical scavenger tBuOH and moderately suppressed by N-2 purging, the inhibiting ratios being 87.7% and 27.8% at breakpoint, respectively. Electron spin resonance experiments suggested that unidentified radicals were generated by breakpoint chlorination. The center dot OH and unidentified radical species contributions to CBZ elimination were <23.7% and >76.3%, respectively, when a pseudo steady state breakpoint chlorination was performed in a microinjection system with nitrobenzene as center dot OH probe. Although CBZ were efficiently eliminated, breakpoint chlorination of CBZ generated adsorbable organic chlorine. The cytotoxicity of the CBZ solution was therefore increased by breakpoint chlorination, suggesting that biological risk caused by the breakpoint chlorination of micropollutants should be taken into consideration.

AB Characteristics of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in activated sludge strongly depend on wastewater substrates. Proteinaceous substrates (ProS) present in heterogeneous polymeric form are intrinsic and important parts of wastewater substrates for microorganisms in activated sludge systems. However, correlations between ProS and characteristics of EPS are scarce. This study systematically explored the impacts of monomeric (Mono-), low polymeric (Lop-) and high polymeric (HiP-) ProS on compositions and functional groups of EPS in activated sludge. The results showed that the change of polymerization degree of ProS significantly altered the composition of EPS. Compared to EPSmono-pros, the proportion of proteins in EPSLop-pros and EPSHip-pros increased by 12.8% and 27.7%, respectively, while that of polysaccharides decreased by 22.9% and 63.6%, respectively. Moreover, the proportion of humic compounds in EPSLOP-Pros and EPSHiP-Pros were similar to 6 and similar to 16-fold higher than that in EPSMono-ProS, respectively. The accumulation of humic compounds in EPS increased the unsaturation degree of EPS molecules, and thereby reduced the energy requirement for electrons transition of amide bonds and aromatic groups. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analyses detected more molecular clusters in EPSHiP-ProS, indicating more complex composition of EPS in HiP-ProS fed activated sludge. Spectroscopic characterization revealed the dominance of hydrocarbon, protein, polysaccharide and aromatic associated bonds in all three EPS. Nevertheless, with the increase of polymerization degree of ProS, the protein associated bonds (such as -CO-NH-, C=O, N-C, N-H) increased, while the polysaccharide associated bonds (such as C-O-C, C-O-H, O=C-OH) decreased. This paper paves a path to understand the role of ProS in affecting the production and characteristics of EPS in biological wastewater treatment systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed at evaluating the contribution of low voltage electric field, both alternating (AC) and direct (DC) currents, on the prevention of bacterial attachment and cell inactivation to highly electrically conductive self-supporting carbon nanotubes (CNT) membranes at conditions which encourage biofilm formation. A mutant strain of Pseudomonas putida S12 was used a model bacterium and either capacitive or resistive electrical circuits and two flow regimes, flow-through and cross-flow filtration, were studied. Major emphasis was placed on AC due to its ability of repulsing and inactivating bacteria. AC voltage at 1.5 V, 1 kHz frequency and wave pulse above offset (+0.45) with 100 Omega external resistance on the ground side prevented almost completely attachment of bacteria (>98.5%) with concomitant high inactivation (95.3 +/- 2.5%) in flow-through regime. AC resulted more effective than DC, both in terms of biofouling reduction compared to cathodic DC and in terms of cell inactivation compared to anodic DC. Although similar trends were observed, a net reduced extent of prevention of bacterial attachment and inactivation was observed in filtration as compared to flow-through regime, which is mainly attributed to the permeate drag force, also supported by theoretical calculations in DC in capacitive mode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis suggests a pure resistor behavior in resistance mode compared to involvement of redox reactions in capacitance mode, as source for bacteria detachment and inactivation. Although further optimization is required, electrically polarized CNT membranes offer a viable anti-biofouling strategy to hinder biofouling and simplify membrane care during filtration.

AB Microplastics are anthropogenic contaminants which have been found in oceans, lakes and rivers. Investigations focusing on drinking water are rare and studies have mainly been using micro-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (mu-FT-IR). A major limitation of this technique is its inability to detect particles smaller than 20 mu m. However, micro-Raman spectroscopy is capable of detecting even smaller particle sizes. Therefore, we show that this technique, which was used in this study, is particularly useful in detecting microplastics in drinking water where particle sizes are in the low micrometer range. In our study, we compared the results from drinking water distributed in plastic bottles, glass bottles and beverage cartons.
   We tested the microplastic content of water from 22 different returnable and single-use plastic bottles, 3 beverage cartons and 9 glass bottles obtained from grocery stores in Germany. Small (-50-500 mu m) and very small (1-50 mu m) microplastic fragments were found in every type of water. Interestingly, almost 80% of all microplastic particles found had a particle size between 5 and 20 mu m and were therefore not detectable by the analytical techniques used in previous studies. The average microplastics content was 118 +/- 88 particles/l in returnable, but only 14 +/- 14 particles/l in single-use plastic bottles. The micro plastics content in the beverage cartons was only 11 +/- 8 particles/l. Contrary to our assumptions we found high amounts of plastic particles in some of the glass bottled waters (range 0-253 particles/l, mean 50 +/- 52 particles/l). A statistically significant difference from the blank value (14 +/- 13) to the investigated packaging types could only be shown comparing to the returnable bottles (p < 0.05).
   Most of the particles in water from returnable plastic bottles were identified as consisting of polyester (primary polyethylene terephthalate PET, 84%) and polypropylene (PP; 7%). This is not surprising since the bottles are made of PET and the caps are made of PP. In water from single-use plastic bottles only a few micro-PET-particles have been found. In the water from beverage cartons and also from glass bottles, microplastic particles other than PET were found, for example polyethylene or polyolefins. This can be explained by the fact that beverage cartons are coated with polyethylene foils and caps are treated with lubricants. Therefore, these findings indicate that the packaging itself may release microparticles. The main fraction of the microplastic particles identified are of very small size with dimensions less than 20 mu m, which is not detectable with the mu-FT-IR technique used in previous studies.

AB A novel Phototrophic Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal (Photo-EBPR) system, consisting of a consortium of photosynthetic organisms and polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs), was studied in this work. A sequencing batch reactor was fed with a mixture of acetate and propionate (75% -25%) and subjected to dark/light cycles in order to select a photo-EBPR system containing PAOs and photosynthetic organisms, the latter likely providers of oxygen to the system. The results from the selection period (stage 1) showed that the photo-EBPR culture was capable of performing P release in the dark and P uptake in the presence of light, under limited oxygen concentrations. During the optimization period, the aeration period, which was initially provided at the end of the light phase, was gradually reduced until a nonaerated system was achieved, while the light intensity was increased. After optimization of the operational conditions, the selected consortium of photosynthetic organisms/PAOs showed high capacity of P removal in the light phase in the absence of air or other electron acceptor. A net P removal of 34 +/- 3 mg-P/L was achieved, with a volumetric P removal rate of 15 +/- 2 mg-P/L.h, and 79 +/- 8% of P removal from the system. Also, in limiting oxygen conditions, the P uptake rate was independent of the PHA consumption, which demonstrates that the organisms obtained energy for P removal from light. These results indicated that a photo-EBPR system can be a potential solution for P removal with low COD/P ratios and in the absence of air, prospecting the use of natural sunlight as illumination, which would reduce the costs of EBPR operation regarding aeration.

AB Potassium ferrate (K2FeO4) is an effective oxidant that may be used as a pre- or post-oxidant in the purification of source water with cyanobacterial issues. To provide a better basis for the application of this oxidant during water treatment processes, the impacts of K2FeO4 on the cell viability of Microcystis aeruginosa and the fate of associated microcystins (MCs) were investigated in various water matrices. The results showed that a water matrix can significantly affect the effectiveness of K2FeO4 on cyanobacteria inactivation. 10 mg L-1 K2FeO4 induced significant cell lysis of M. aeruginosa in Ran Yi Tan Reservoir (RYTR) water while the membrane integrity was relatively unaffected in ASM-1 media and Cheng Kung Lake (CKL) water. The reduced efficiency of K2FeO4 oxidation may be attributed to the manganese (Mn2+) and organic matter (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, EDTA) in the ASM-1 media and high concentrations of natural organic matters (NOMs) in the CKL water. A delayed Chick-Watson model was applied to simulate the experimental data for cyanobacterial cell rupture, and the cell lysis rates of the M. aeruginosa samples were determined to be 128-242 M-1 s(-1) (mol L-1 s(-1)). Generally, no significant increases in extracellular MCs were observed in the three different waters, even in the RYTR water where the membrane integrity of the cyanobacterial cells was severely disrupted. Therefore, K2FeO4 could be a potential pre-oxidant to enhance subsequent treatments for cyanobacteria removal without affecting the cell integrity, or could serve as a post-oxidant to inactivate cyanobacterial cells and degrade MCs effectively, depending on the specific water matrix.

AB An upsurge in the study of antibiotic resistance in the environment has been observed in the last decade. Nowadays, it is becoming increasingly clear that urban wastewater is a key source of antibiotic resistance determinants, i.e. antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes (ARB&ARGs). Urban wastewater reuse has arisen as an important component of water resources management in the European Union and worldwide to address prolonged water scarcity issues. Especially, biological wastewater treatment processes (i.e. conventional activated sludge), which are widely applied in urban wastewater treatment plants, have been shown to provide an ideal environment for the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance. The ability of advanced chemical oxidation processes (AOPs), e.g. light-driven oxidation in the presence of H2O2, ozonation, homogeneous and heterogeneous photocatalysis, to inactivate ARB and remove ARGs in wastewater effluents has not been yet evaluated through a systematic and integrated approach. Consequently, this review seeks to provide an extensive and critical appraisal on the assessment of the efficiency of these processes in inactivating ARB and removing ARGs in wastewater effluents, based on recent available scientific literature. It tries to elucidate how the key operating conditions may affect the process efficiency, while pinpointing potential areas for further research and major knowledge gaps which need to be addressed. Also, this review aims at shedding light on the main oxidative damage pathways involved in the inactivation of ARB and removal of ARGs by these processes. In general, the lack and/or heterogeneity of the available scientific data, as well as the different methodological approaches applied in the various studies, make difficult the accurate evaluation of the efficiency of the processes applied. Besides the operating conditions, the variable behavior observed by the various examined genetic constituents of the microbial community, may be directed by the process distinct oxidative damage mechanisms in place during the application of each treatment technology. For example, it was shown in various studies that the majority of cellular damage by advanced chemical oxidation may be on cell wall and membrane structures of the targeted bacteria, leaving the internal components of the cells relatively intact/able to repair damage. As a result, further in-depth mechanistic studies are required, to establish the optimum operating conditions under which oxidative mechanisms target internal cell components such as genetic material and ribosomal structures more intensively, thus conferring permanent damage and/or death and preventing potential post-treatment re-growth.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) contained in lake sediments is a carbon source for many microbial degradation processes, including aerobic and anaerobic mineralization. During anaerobic degradation, DOM is partially consumed and transformed into new molecules while the greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are produced. In this study, we used ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry to trace differences in the composition of solid-phase extractable (PPL resin) pore water DOM (SPE-DOM) isolated from surface sediments of three boreal lakes before and after 40 days of anoxic incubation, with concomitant determination of CH4 and CO2 evolution. CH4 and CO2 production detected by gas chromatography varied considerably among replicates and accounted for fractions of similar to 2-4 x 10(-4) of sedimentary organic carbon for CO2 and similar to 0.8-2.4 x 10(-5) for CH4. In contrast, the relative changes of key bulk parameters during incubation, such as relative proportions of molecular series, elemental ratios, average mass and unsaturation, were regularly in the percent range (1-3% for compounds decreasing and 4-10% for compounds increasing), i.e. several orders of magnitude higher than mineralization alone. Computation of the average carbon oxidation state in CHO molecules of lake pore water DOM revealed rather non-selective large scale transformations of organic matter during incubation, with depletion of highly oxidized and highly reduced CHO molecules, and formation of rather non-labile fulvic acid type molecules. In general, proportions of CHO compounds slightly decreased. Nearly saturated CHO and CHOS lipid-like substances declined during incubation: these rather commonplace molecules were less specific indicators of lake sediment alteration than the particular compounds, such as certain oxygenated aromatics and carboxyl-rich alicyclic acids (CRAM) found more abundant after incubation. There was a remarkable general increase in many CHNO compounds during incubation across all lakes. Differences in DOM transformation between lakes corresponded with lake size and water residence time. While in the small lake Svarttjarn, CRAM increased during incubation, lignin-and tannin-like compounds were enriched in the large lake Bisen, suggesting selective preservation of these rather non-labile aromatic compounds rather than recent synthesis. SPE-DOM after incubation may represent freshly synthesized compounds, leftover bulk DOM which is primarily composed of intrinsically refractory molecules and/or microbial metabolites which were not consumed in our experiments. In spite of a low fraction of the total DOM being mineralized to CO2 and CH4, the more pronounced change in molecular DOM composition during the incubation indicates that diagenetic modification of organic matter can be substantial compared to complete mineralization.

AB This study provides an innovative application of virtual water trade in the traditional allocation of physical water resources in water scarce regions. A multi-objective optimization model was developed to optimize the allocation of physical water and virtual water resources to different water users in Beijing, China, considering the trade-offs between economic benefit and environmental impacts of water consumption. Surface water, groundwater, transferred water and reclaimed water constituted the physical resource of water supply side, while virtual water flow associated with the trade of five major crops (barley, corn, rice, soy and wheat) and three livestock products (beef, pork and poultry) in agricultural sector (calculated by the trade quantities of products and their virtual water contents). Urban (daily activities and public facilities), industry, environment and agriculture (products growing) were considered in water demand side. As for the traditional allocation of physical water resources, the results showed that agriculture and urban were the two predominant water users (accounting 54% and 28%, respectively), while groundwater and surface water satisfied around 70% water demands of different users (accounting 36% and 34%, respectively). When considered the virtual water trade of eight agricultural products in water allocation procedure, the proportion of agricultural consumption decreased to 45% in total water demand, while the groundwater consumption decreased to 24% in total water supply. Virtual water trade overturned the traditional components of water supplied from different sources for agricultural consumption, and became the largest water source in Beijing. Additionally, it was also found that environmental demand took a similar percentage of water consumption in each water source. Reclaimed water was the main water source for industrial and environmental users. The results suggest that physical water resources would mainly satisfy the consumption of urban and environment, and the unbalance between water supply and demand could be filled by virtual water import in water scarce regions.

AB Bioilms are ubiquitous throughout aquatic environments and they are thought to promote the acquisition and dissemination of antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs). This study focused on the occurrence and distribution of five types of ARG in naturally-occurring biofilms, in comparison to associated sediment and water samples, from the Yangtze Estuary, which borders the meta-city of Shanghai, China. The detection frequency and abundances of most ARGs showed the following order: biofilm > sediment > water, which can be attributed to a high level of antibiotics and metals that can accelerate the generation and propagation of ARGs in biofilms. Most of ARG abundances were contributed by extracellular DNA (eDNA) in biofilm and sediment samples. ARGs (sul1, sul2, tetA and tetW) in eDNA were significantly correlated with TOC in both biofilm and sediment samples. Furthermore, both intracellular DNA-associated ARGs per gram of microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and eDNA-associated ARGs per gram of non-MBC and were higher in biofilms than sediments, and the partitioning coefficients of ARGs in eDNA between biofilm and water were higher than those between sediment and water. Our results provide new insight for evaluating the occurrence and abundance of ARGs in aquatic environments, confirming that biofilms are a significant sink for ARGs in the estuarine environment.

AB Environmental concerns regarding the potential ecological risks of metallic oxide nanoparticles (MNPs) in aquatic ecosystems are increasing; sediment is considered a sink for these MNPs. Although several studies have studied the potential impact of MNPs on microbial communities in freshwater and estuarine sediments, limited information is available regarding the influence of MNPs on the metabolic activity of surficial sediment microbial communities and related biogeochemical conditions. To address these issues, a microcosm approach was established to study the metabolic response of surficial sediment microbial communities to a single addition of TiO2 or CeO2 NPs (5 mg/L) using oxygen microelectrodes, enzyme activity measurements, and high-throughput sequencing. Rapid sedimentation of MNPs (regardless of NP type) was observed in freshwater samples, and most (up to 85%) accumulated in surface sediments (<5 mm). Microelectrode profile measurements in pre-incubated sediments treated with MNPs showed that the oxygen concentration decreased at a slower rate with increasing sediment depth compared to that in untreated controls. Biological oxygen consumption in the uppermost sediment layer (0-1500 mu m) was significantly inhibited by MNPs, as calculated from steady-state microprofiles, with CeO2 NPs resulting in enhanced acute toxicity than TiO2 NPs. High-throughput sequencing showed that MNP exposure increased the bacterial diversity and altered the bacterial community structure, regardless of NP type. The abundance of three dominant bacterial genera, Methylotenera, Cytophagceae_uncultured (classified as an aerobic bacterium), and Cyanobacteria_norank (a facultative bacterium), was markedly reduced by MNPs, which was primarily responsible for inhibiting microbial-mediated oxygen consumption in surficial sediments. In summary, short-term exposure to MNPs negatively affected the metabolic activity of benthic microbial communities, which could influence the biogeochemical functions along the sediment-water interface.

AB The estimation of stormwater pollutant concentrations is a primary requirement of integrated urban water management. In order to determine effective sampling strategies for estimating pollutant concentrations, data from extensive field measurements at seven different catchments was used. At all sites, 1-min resolution continuous flow measurements, as well as flow-weighted samples, were taken and analysed for total suspend solids (TSS), total nitrogen (TN) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). For each of these parameters, the data was used to calculate the Event Mean Concentrations (EMCs) for each event. The measured Site Mean Concentrations (SMCs) were taken as the volume-weighted average of these EMCs for each parameter, at each site. 17 different sampling strategies, including random and fixed strategies were tested to estimate SMCs, which were compared with the measured SMCs. The ratios of estimated/measured SMCs were further analysed to determine the most effective sampling strategies. Results indicate that the random sampling strategies were the most promising method in reproducing SMCs for TSS and TN, while some fixed sampling strategies were better for estimating the SMC of E. coli. The differences in taking one, two or three random samples were small (up to 20% for TSS, and 10% for TN and E. coli), indicating that there is little benefit in investing in collection of more than one sample per event if attempting to estimate the SMC through monitoring of multiple events. It was estimated that an average of 27 events across the studied catchments are needed for characterising SMCs of TSS with a 90% confidence interval (CI) width of 1.0, followed by E.coli (average 12 events) and TN (average 11 events). The coefficient of variation of pollutant concentrations was linearly and significantly correlated to the 90% confidence interval ratio of the estimated/measured SMCs (R-2 = 0.49; P < 0.01) as well as the number of events required to achieve certain accuracy, and hence could be a promising surrogate for determining the sampling frequency needed to accurately estimate SMCs of pollutants.

AB Iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) is considered as one of iodine sources for formation of toxic iodinated disinfection byproducts (I-DBPs) during disinfection. This study investigated transformation of a typical ICM, iopamidol (IPM) by zero valent iron (ZVI) and the effect of transformation on the formation of I-DBPs during chloramination. It was found that the presence of ZVI could deiodinate IPM into I- and the transformation of IPM exhibited a pseudo-first-order kinetics. Acidic circumstance, SO42-, Cl- and monochloramine could promote the transformation of IPM by ZVI, while SiO32- inhibited the transformation of IPM. Moreover, the transformation of IPM by ZVI changed both the formed species and amounts of I-DBPs during chloramination. During the chloramination of IPM-containing water, CHCl2I and iodoacetic acid were the predominant iodinated trihalomethanes (I-THMs) and iodinated haloacetic acids (I-HAAs), respectively in the absence of ZVI, while CHI3 and triiodoacetic acid became the predominant ones with 1.0 g L-1 ZVI. The addition of 5.0 g L-1 ZVI increased I-DBPs formation amounts by 6.0 folds after 72 h and maximum formation of I-DBPs occurred at pH 5.0. Enhanced I-DBPs formation was also observed with various real water sources. Given that ZVI ubiquitously exists in the unlined cast iron distribution pipes, the deiodination of IPM by ZVI during distribution may increase the formation of I-DBPs, which needs receive enough attention.

AB Here we detail a previously unappreciated loss mechanism inherent to capacitive deionization (CDI) cycling operation that has a substantial role determining performance. This mechanism reflects the fact that desalinated water inside a cell is partially lost to re-salination if desorption is carried out immediately after adsorption. We describe such effects by a parameter called the flow efficiency, and show that this efficiency is distinct from and yet multiplicative with other highly-studied adsorption efficiencies. Flow losses can be minimized by flowing more feed solution through the cell during desalination; however, this also results in less effluent concentration reduction. While the rationale outlined here is applicable to all CDI cell architectures that rely on cycling, we validate our model with a flow-through electrode CDI device operated in constant-current mode. We find excellent agreement between flow efficiency model predictions and experimental results, thus giving researchers simple equations by which they can estimate this distinct loss process for their operation.

AB Fouling mechanisms underlying the filtration behaviors of alginate solution caused by calcium addition were investigated by Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and density functional theory (DFT) techniques. Filtration tests showed that specific filtration resistance (SFR) of alginate solution (0.75 g L-1) monotonously increased with calcium addition at a relatively low range of calcium concentration (0-1.0 mM), and SFR (2.61 x 10(15) m kg(-1)) of alginate solution with 1.0 mM calcium addition was extremely high as compared with sludge suspension. Characterizations by X-ray photoelectric spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the composition of functional groups, elements and thermal stability of alginate was not apparently affected by calcium concentration. Howbeit, THz-TDS spectra showed that calcium addition caused structural variation of alginate polymer in solution. DTF calculation results showed that initial binding of alginate chains induced by calcium ions preferentially occurred in intermolecular other than intramolecular, and moreover, the two alginate chains bridged by a calcium atom tend to stretch in a tetrahedron structure (cross to each other) other than parallel to each other. According to these results, "chemical potential gap" depicted by Flory-Huggins theory was suggested to be responsible for the filtration behaviors of alginate solution caused by calcium addition. This study provided the mechanistic insights into membrane fouling. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Advanced reduction by the extremely strong reducing species, hydrated electron (e(aq)(-)), is a promising and viable approach to eliminate a wide variety of persistent and toxic contaminants. In this study, we proposed a sulfite/iodide/UV process, which offered efficient production of e(aq)(-) for contaminant reduction. Using monochloroacetic acid (MCAA) as a simple e(aq)(-) probe, the availability of e(aq)(-) was assessed, and the mechanism involving the roles of S(IV) and iodide in the process was elucidated. A pronounced synergistic effect of S(IV) and iodide was observed in MCAA reductive dechlorination. The efficiency was much more dependent on the iodide concentration due to its higher absorptivity and quantum yield of tat. S(IV) played a dual role by producing e(aq)(-) via photoionization of SO32- and by reducing the reactive iodine species formed to avoid their scavenging of e(aq)(-). When S(IV) was available, cycling of iodide occurred, favoring the constant eai production. The formation and transformation kinetics of sulfite radical were studied to verify the roles of S(IV) and iodide in the process. A kinetic model of MCAA dechlorination was also developed to quantify the earinitiated reduction efficiency, highlighting the effects of S(IV), iodide, and pH. High pH favored the reduction, and the process was still effective in field surface water. This study underscores the importance of producing e(aq)(-) efficiently and of minimizing the e(aq)(-) scavenging of intermediates inherently formed and accumulated, and highlights the potential of the sulfite/iodide/UV process to efficiently eliminate recalcitrant contaminants.

AB The transport of nano scale iron particles (NIP) in fractures is of concern for remediation of both fractured aquifers and porous aquifers when hydro-fracking and flow in preferential pathways takes place. In this study the transport of various NIP in a natural discrete fractured chalk core was investigated and their mass recoveries calculated. Four different types of NIP were tested and characterized in two ionic strength (IS) solutions at a particle concentration of 100-200 mg/l. The effect of IS, stability (sedimentation rate), particle size, solution viscosity and stabilizer were studied. NIP stability ranged from 1 to 100% following 120 min of stability tests and recoveries ranged from about 6 to 69%. The stabilizer type and concentration were shown to have significant role in NIP recoveries, especially at increased IS. It was evident that gravitational stability is the most crucial factor dominating transport of NIP. Accordingly, stability tests were shown to be a reliable indicator of NIP mobility. The high recoveries of some NIP tested, combined with the lack of clogging effect illustrates the enhanced mobility of NIP in fractures. The wide range of recoveries indicates NIP transport manipulation potential in such media. We therefore suggest that application of NIP in contaminated fractures has considerable potential as a remediation measure. In order to achieve NIP distribution in the aquifer while avoiding leakage to the environment, NIP stabilizer concentration should be adjusted according to the site-specific hydrogeochemical properties of the contaminated media.

AB A novel phosphorous (P) removal and recovery process using a membrane bioreactor (MBR) with ferric iron dosing and acidogenic co-fermentation was developed for municipal wastewater treatment. The very different solubility of Fe(III)-P and Fe(II)-P complex and the microbial transformation of Fe(III) to Fe(II) were utilized for P removal and recovery. By means of Fe-induced precipitation, chemical P removal was effectively achieved by an MBR with a flat-plate ceramic membrane; however, the Fe(III)-P solids accumulated in the MBR that constituted a significant fraction of the activated sludge. Anaerobic co fermentation of the MBR sludge and food waste in a side-stream allowed the extraction of P and Fe from the sludge into the supernatant. The P in the supernatant was recovered as a fertilizer resource, while the sludge was returned to the MBR tank. The experimental results show that by adding FeCl3\ at 20 mg Fe/L into the influent of domestic wastewater, about 95.6% of total P could be removed by the MBR. One fifth (20%) of the sludge in the MBR was circulated daily through the side-stream fermenters for co fermentation with cooked rice as the model food waste. The sludge underwent acidogenesis and dissimilatory iron reduction, resulting in a drop of the pH to below 5.0 and reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II). Owing to the high solubility of the Fe(II)-P complex, P and Fe were then dissolved and released from the sludge into the supernatant. By simply adjusting the solution pH to 8.0, the P and Fe(II) in the supernatant readily re-precipitated to form vivianite for the P recovery. Using the iron dosing MBR and side stream sludge fermentation, an overall P recovery efficiency of 62.1% from wastewater influent can be achieved, and the problem of inorganic build-up in the MBR is effectively alleviated.

AB Little is known about the occurrence and fate of synthetic phenolic antioxidants (SPAs) and their metabolites in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this study, inventory, source, mass loading, and discharge of five SPAs, including 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT) and four of its metabolites were examined, based on the concentrations determined in wastewater influent, primary effluent, final effluent, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and sludge collected from two WWTPs (denoted as WWTPA and WWTPB) in the Albany area of New York State. The respective median concentrations of sum of SPAs (Sigma SPAs = 6 compounds including metabolites) and SPA-metabolites (Sigma metabolites = 4 metabolites) were 2455-3330 and 290-465 ng/L in influents, and 1580-1604 and 511-822 ng/L in final effluents. Adsorption to sludge (Sigma SPAs ranged as 2420-4680 ng/g dry wt) accounted for similar to 1% of the SPA removal. The removal efficiency (RE) for BHT in WWTP5 ranged between 62.3% and 76.2%, whereas negative REs were found for SPA-metabolites a ([-3020%]-[-65.6%]). WWTP-based mass loading of BHT accounted for similar to 4%-10% of the total production volume reported in the USA, whereas similar to 1.0% of the annual production of BHT was discharged from WWTP through effluents. BHT present in personal care products was estimated to explain for >91% of the mass loading source into WWTPs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Shale gas produced water (SGPW) treatment imposes greater technical challenges because of its high concentration of various contaminants. Membrane distillation crystallization (MDC) has a great potential to manage SGPW since it is capable of recovering both water and minerals at high rates, up to near a zero liquid discharge (ZLD) condition. To evaluate the feasibility of MDC for SGPW treatment, MDC performance indicators, such as water recovery rate, solid production rate (SPR) and specific energy consumption (SEC), were systematically investigated, to our knowledge for the first time, by using actual SGPW from Eagle Ford Shale (USA). The main operating parameters including feed cross-flow velocity (CFV) and crystallization temperature (T-Cr) were optimized by performing a series of MDC experiments. The results reported that water and minerals were effectively recovered with 84% of recovery rate and 2.72 kg/m(2)day of SPR under respective optimal operating conditions. Furthermore, the scale mechanism was firstly identified as limiting factor for MDC performance degradation. Lastly, SEC of MDC was estimated to be as low as 28.2 kWh/m(3) under ideal optimal operating conditions. Our experimental observations demonstrated that MDC could sustainably and effectively recover water and mineral with low energy consumption from SGPW by optimizing operating condition.

AB Here, we evaluated the removal of three representative human enteric viruses - adenovirus (AdV) type 40, coxsackievirus (CV) B5, and hepatitis A virus (HAV) IB - and one surrogate of human caliciviruses - murine norovirus (MNV) type 1 - by coagulation-rapid sand filtration, using water samples from eight water sources for drinking water treatment plants in Japan. The removal ratios of a plant virus (pepper mild mottle virus; PMMoV) and two bacteriophages (MS2 and phi X174) were compared with the removal ratios of human enteric viruses to assess the suitability of PMMoV, MS2, and phi X174 as surrogates for human enteric viruses. The removal ratios of AdV, CV, HAV, and MNV, evaluated via the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, were 0.8-2.5-log(10) when commercially available polyaluminum chloride (PACl, basicity 1.5) and virgin silica sand were used as the coagulant and filter medium, respectively. The type of coagulant affected the virus removal efficiency, but the age of silica sand used in the rapid sand filtration did not. Coagulation-rapid sand filtration with non-sulfated, high-basicity PACls (basicity 2.1 or 2.5) removed viruses more efficiently than the other aluminum-based coagulants. The removal ratios of MS2 were sometimes higher than those of the three human enteric viruses and MNV, whereas the removal ratios of phi X174 tended to be smaller than those of the three human enteric viruses and MNV. In contrast, the removal ratios of PMMoV were similar to and strongly correlated with those of the three human enteric viruses and MNV. Thus, PMMoV appears to be a suitable surrogate for human enteric viruses for the assessment of the efficacy of coagulation-rapid sand filtration to remove viruses. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB To protect the ecosystem and drinking water resources in Switzerland and in the countries of the downstream catchments, a new Swiss water protection act entered into force in 2016 aiming to reduce the discharge of micropollutants from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). As a consequence, selected WWTPs must be upgraded by an advanced treatment for micropollutant abatement with suitable and economic options such as (powdered) activated carbon treatment or ozonation. WWTP Neugut (105'000 people equivalent) was the first WWTP in Switzerland to implement a long-term full-scale ozonation. Differing specific ozone doses in the range of 0.35-0.97 g O-3/g DOC were applied to determine the adequate ozone dose to fulfill the requirements of the Swiss water protection act. Based on this assessment, a specific ozone dose of 0.55 g O-3/g DOC is recommended at this plant to ensure an average abatement of the twelve selected indicator substances by >= 80% over the whole treatment. A monitoring of 550 substances confirmed that this dose was very efficient to abate a broad range of micropollutants by >79% on average. After ozonation, an additional biological post-treatment is required to eliminate possible negative ecotoxicological effects generated during ozonation caused by biodegradable ozonation transformation products (OTPs) and oxidation by-products (OBPs). Three biological treatments (sand filtration, moving bed, fixed bed) and granular activated carbon (GAC, fresh and pre-loaded) filtration were evaluated as post-treatments after ozonation. In parallel, a fresh GAC filter directly connected to the effluent of the secondary clarifier was assessed. Among the three purely biological post-treatments, the sand filtration performed best in terms of removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), assimilable organic carbon (AOC) and total suspended solids (TSS). The fresh activated carbon filtration ensured a significant additional micropollutants abatement after ozonation due to sorption. The relative abatement of the indicator substances ranged between 20 and 89% after 27'000 bed volumes (BV) and was still substantial at 50'000 BV. In an identical GAC filter running in parallel and being fed with the effluent of the secondary clarifier, the elimination was less efficient. Seven primary OTPs (chlorothiazide and six N-oxides) formed during ozonation could be quantified thanks to available reference standards. Their concentration decreased with increasing specific ozone doses with the concomitant formation of other OTPs. The seven OTPs were found to be stable compounds and were not abated in the biological post-treatments. They were sorbed in the fresh GAC filter, but less efficiently than the corresponding parent compounds. Two OBPs, bromate (BrO3-) and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), were formed during ozonation but did not exceeded 5 mu g/L for bromate and 30 ng/L for NDMA at the recommended specific ozone dose of 0.55 g O-3/g DOC. NDMA was well abated in all post-treatments (minimum 41% during fixed bed filtration, maximum 83% during fresh GAC filtration), while bromate was very stable as expected. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Little is known about the forces that determine the assembly of diverse bacterial communities inhabiting drinking water treatment filters and how this affects drinking water quality. Two contrasting ecological theories can help to understand how natural microbial communities assemble; niche theory and neutral theory, where environmental deterministic factors or stochastic factors predominate respectively. This study investigates the development of the microbial community on two common contrasting filter materials (quartz sand and granular activated carbon-GAC), to elucidate the main factors governing their assembly, through the evaluation of environmental (i.e. filter medium type) and stochastic forces (random deaths, births and immigration). Laboratory-scale filter columns were used to mimic a rapid gravity filter; the microbiome of the filter materials, and of the filter influent and effluent, was characterised using next generation 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and flow-cytometry. Chemical parameters (i.e. dissolved organic carbon, trihalomethanes formation) were also monitored to assess the final effluent quality. The filter communities seemed to be strongly assembled by selection rather than neutral processes, with only 28% of those OTUs shared with the source water detected on the filter medium following predictions using a neutral community model. GAC hosted a phylogenetically more diverse community than sand. The two filter media communities seeded the effluent water, triggering differences in both water quality and community composition of the effluents. Overall, GAC proved to be better than sand in controlling microbial growth, by promoting higher bacterial decay rates and hosting less bacterial cells, and showed better performance for putative pathogen control by leaking less Legionella cells into the effluent water.

AB Perfluorinated organic compounds (PFC) are an important group of pollutants, which are difficult to be degraded in conventional water treatment. Even hydroxyl radical based processes are not capable to degrade these compounds. Sulfate radicals can oxidize a group of PFC, i.e., perfluorinated carboxylic (PFCAs) acids. However, information in literature on kinetics and reaction mechanism is largely based on model simulations which are prone to errors. The present study provides mechanistic insights based on product formation, material balances, competition kinetics experiments and quantum chemical calculations. Furthermore, energy requirements for sulfate radical based degradation of PFCA is evaluated in the present study. PFCAs can be partly mineralized in chain reactions initiated by sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-). The perfluorinated acetic acid (TFA), propionic acid, and butanoic acid are largely degraded in a primary reaction with sulfate radicals. In case of PFCA with a chain length of > 4 carbons low yields of PFCA products were observed. Regarding reaction kinetics sulfate radicals react very slow with PFCAs (approximate to 10(4) M-1 s(-1)). Thus, the energy demand required for generation of SO4 center dot- by photolysis of S2O82- (UV/S2O82-) is very high. A 90% degradation of a PFCA by UV/S2O82- was estimated to be 55 kW h m(-3) in pure water. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Calvarium; Cavernous hemangioma; Dural involvement; Skull neoplasm
ID FRONTAL BONE; TUMORS; SCALP
AB BACKGROUND: Cavernous hemangioma (CH) of the bone is a rare, benign neoplasm found usually in the vertebral body. This tumor rarely develops in the calvaria, with predilection to occur in the frontal and temporoparietal bones.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old man with a right frontal palpable mass was admitted to our hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large extra-axial tumor in the right frontal bone. Intraoperatively, the bony mass involved the multilayers composed of extracranium-skull-dura-intradura-cortex. Pathologic examination revealed a typical calvarial CH penetrating dura mater.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the second reported case of calvarial CH with complete erosion of the dural plane and extension into subdural space. Although surgical resection is generally safe and easy, the possibility of dural invasion should be kept in mind for safe resection of calvarial CH, especially overlying the eloquent brain area.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Anomaly; Bilateral; Cervical spinal cord; Compression; Vertebral artery
ID C2 SEGMENTAL TYPE; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; SEVERE NAPE; MYELOPATHY; PAIN
AB BACKGROUND: Anomalies of the vertebral arteries are rare and usually detected incidentally. However, very rarely, they can manifest with clinical symptoms. We describe such a symptomatic case of high cervical spinal cord compression associated with persistent C2 segmental arteries.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 67-year-old man presented with a 5-year history of worsening left-sided weakness and gait disturbance. Magnetic resonance imaging, 3-dimensional computed tomography, and digital subtraction angiography revealed anomalous courses of the vertebral arteries, which compressed the cervical spinal cord at the C1 level from both sides. Interestingly, the left vertebral artery had fenestration, which supposedly reflected that the intradural paramedian longitudinal axis had developmentally persisted until more distally on the left. Microvascular decompression was performed to transpose the offending vertebral arteries. With vascular tapes made of polyglycolic acid sheets and fascia, the vertebral arteries compressing the cervical spine were anchored to the dura mater of the vertebral arch. This maneuver effectively relieved the neurovascular conflict created by the bilateral anomalous vertebral arteries, and the patient's myelopathy improved after surgery. To our knowledge, this is the first report to clearly demonstrate this combination of vertebral artery anomalies causing clinical symptoms and its successful treatment by microvascular decompression.
   CONCLUSIONS: Transposition of the vertebral artery by anchoring to the dura mater of the vertebral arch could be an effective and safe option for these disease conditions.

   ADULT
AB BACKGROUND: Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt is the most frequent treatment for hydrocephalus. VP shunt malfunction is a very common problem in neurosurgical practice, often requiring shunt revision procedures. In some cases, complete removal of a VP shunt may present difficulties, leading the surgeon to leave the ventricular catheter in situ. This decision is often made to avoid possible adverse events, primarily risk of life-threatening hemorrhage. However, a nonfunctioning catheter left in the ventricular system may lead to further complications.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of an adult man who presented with a tumor-like cystic lesion, with mural and nodular postcontrast enhancement, caused by a huge granuloma formed around the tip of a retained ventricular catheter.
   CONCLUSIONS: This occurrence is extremely rare, and this is the first reported case in the literature. Preoperative differential diagnosis was challenging and included infection, metastasis, dysembryogenetic lesions, and rare reversible porencephalic cysts. According to several physiopathogenetic theories recently reported in the literature, the granuloma may develop as the result of persistent chronic inflammatory reactions between the ventricular catheter left in situ and the brain parenchyma. Application of neuroendoscopic techniques is improving management of VP shunt revisions, allowing safe removal of catheters stuck or lost in the ventricular system. Neuroendoscopy may represent an additional option to avoid possible complications related to retained ventricular catheters.

DT Article
DE Atlanto-occipital dislocation; Halo fixation; Trauma
ID ATLANTO-OCCIPITAL DISLOCATION; MANAGEMENT; SURVIVAL; VEST
AB BACKGROUND: Atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD) is the most uncommon form of traumatic cervical spine injury. The majority of patients die before reaching higher-level care, and only a small percentage of patients with AOD survive the initial injury after receiving tertiary care. As such, there is a paucity of evidence-based management guidelines for treating this condition. Halo vest fixation has been a proposed method for interim stability while these patients undergo medical optimization for surgical intervention. There have been several reports of worsening AOD after halo placement. Reverse Trendelenburg position after halo fixation has been previously described to aid in the reduction of AOD, as well as concomitant atlantoaxial dislocation by gravitational downward force.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In this series we present 2 cases of obese patients (body mass index >30) with AOD treated by halo fixation that had increased distraction after head of bed elevation.
   CONCLUSION: Our theorized mechanism for this phenomenon is due to the downward pull of subaxial forces secondary to a large body habitus.

DT Article
DE Bilateral foot drop; Endoscopic spine surgery; Minimally invasive
ID LUMBAR DECOMPRESSION; STENOSIS; OLDER
AB BACKGROUND: Acute bilateral isolated foot drop due to lumbar disk prolapse with canal stenosis is rare with only 3 cases reported in literature. Our patient was managed using the percutaneous full endoscopic technique. This is mainly to highlight the ease of access and patient outcome with preoperative and postoperative images to support our minimally invasive treatment for this rare condition.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 46-year-old male presented with sudden-onset severe back pain with bilateral foot drop. Clinical examination showed a bilateral L5 radiculopathy with normal perianal sensation. Investigations excluded other causes of bilateral foot drop. A magnetic resonance imaging scan showed disk herniation at the right L4-L5 (inferior migrated) and L5-S1 level (paracentral and extraforaminal) with spinal canal stenosis at the L2-L3 and L5-S1 levels due to ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. The patient underwent percutaneous endoscopic stenosis lumbar decompression at the L2-L3 and L5-S1 level. At the right L4-L5, L5S1 level, transforaminal endoscopic diskectomy was done using the conventional percutaneous approach. The inferior migrated disk of the L4-L5 level was removed using a left L5-S1 contralateral approach. The patient recovered with favorable outcome and added benefits of minimally invasive surgery.
   CONCLUSION: Lumbar disk prolapsewith canal stenosis should be considered in patients presenting with bilateral isolated foot drop. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of percutaneous endoscopic treatment to address multiple-lumbarlevel pathology for this rare condition of acute bilateral isolated foot drop.

AB BACKGROUND: The causes of chronic diskogenic back pain have not yet been clearly identified. Neural ingrowth around the annulus is widely considered to be one of the possible cause. However, neuropathy around the annulus has yet to be observed visually. We report a case of a hotspot that was observed in an epiduroscopic view, but not in imaging findings.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 46-year-old woman was admitted with pain in the back, left buttock, and posterior thigh for 2 years. A straight leg raising test was positive on the left side, and left great toe dorsiflexion was decreased to grade 3/5. The Visual Analog Scale pain score was 7/10. On the basis of her symptoms, epidural block, medial branch block, sacroiliac joint block, piriformis muscle injection, physical therapy, and medication were attempted, but no improvement in symptoms was observed. A provocation test was performed at the L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1 intervertebral disks, and severe pain was induced in the L5-S1 intervertebral disk, which was not suspicious on magnetic resonance imaging. We performed transforaminal epiduroscopic laser ablation on L5-S1 and found a hotspot on L5-S1 during the procedure. During laser provocation of the hotspot, the patient complained of severe pain in her lower back and legs, and her pain decreased after ablation of hotspot with laser and improvement in motor weakness was noticed.
   CONCLUSION: In this study, we observed annulus hotspots, which have not been observed in imaging studies such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in patients with chronic back pain and leg pain, and observed remarkable symptom improvement after transforaminal epiduroscopic laser ablation.

AB BACKGROUND: We report a series of 3 cases of metastatic thymoma to the spine with spinal cord compression. An extensive literature review of thymic metastases to the spine was completed to provide a comprehensive appraisal of current prognostic indicators and potential treatment algorithms to help guide clinicians in treatment management.
   CASE DESCRIPTIONS: Between 2000 and 2017, 3 patients received diagnoses of thymic metastases to the spine at our institution. Metastasis presentation occurred from 2 to 8 years after the initial diagnosis with thymic cancer. All 3 patients presented with signs and symptoms of spinal cord/cauda equina compression, and underwent surgical intervention. Postoperative treatments varied among all 3 patients, 1 receiving chemotherapy, another undergoing radiation, and the third having had no further treatment because of extensive systemic disease.
   CONCLUSIONS: Upon review of the literature, 16 case reports/series described 28 total patients with spine metastases secondary to thymoma/thymic carcinoma. The presentations varied widely, including age, neurologic deficits, time from initial diagnosis to metastasis, and histologic grading. The only widely accepted prognostic factor is completeness of tumor resection, whereas clinical staging, histologic type, or both may also have prognostic value. Thus, gross total resection and spinal decompression should be prioritized in cases of surgical intervention. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are generally recommended. However, given the lack of standardized treatment algorithms, individualized regimens should be formulated on a case-specific basis.

AB BACKGROUND: Although schwannomas are commonly found in the head and neck region, sinonasal tract involvement is extremely rare, estimated as <4%. The presence of these lesions in the frontal sinus is even less common.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Two patients presented with schwannomas originating in the frontal sinus with variable degrees of extension. These patients underwent resection of the tumors via an endoscopic or combined approach. The histologic diagnosis confirmed schwannoma in both cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although these lesions have traditionally been approached through larger craniotomies and open procedures, we describe less invasive approaches for these rare frontal sinus schwannomas and demonstrate them as a valid alternative with minimal morbidity for patients.

AB BACKGROUND: The arcuate foramen (AF), or ponticulus posticus, is an anatomic variant of the first cervical vertebra that consists of a complete or partial osseous bridge over the groove for the vertebral artery and extends from the posterior aspect of the superior articular facet to the superior lateral border of the posterior arch. The AF has been associated with clinical symptoms, such as headache, migraine, neck pain, shoulder pain, arm pain, and vertebral artery dissection. We aimed to test whether the prevalence of the AF has decreased in the modern human population over the past centuries as a result of reduction in inbreeding and endogamy.
   METHODS: Possible reduction in the prevalence of the AF was assessed by comparing a 17th century rural sample (n=108) with a 20th century modern urban sample (n=192).
   RESULTS: When comparing the 17th and the 20th century samples, we found a statistically significant (P = 0.003) reduction of 14.5% (95% confidence interval 4.5-24.5) in the prevalence of the AF.
   CONCLUSIONS: Prevalenceof the AF has been decreasing over the past centuries.

AB BACKGROUND: Multilevel spine fusion surgery for adult deformity correction is associated with significant blood loss and coagulopathy. Tranexamic acid reduces blood loss in high-risk surgery, but the efficacy of a low-dose regimen is unknown.
   METHODS: Sixty-one patients undergoing multilevel complex spinal fusion with and without osteotomies were randomly assigned to receive low-dose tranexamic acid (10 mg/kg loading dose, then 1 mg.kg(-1).hr(-1) throughout surgery) or placebo. The primary outcome was the total volume of red blood cells transfused intraoperatively.
   RESULTS: Thirty-one patients received tranexamic acid, and 30 patients received placebo. Patient demographics, risk of major transfusion, preoperative hemoglobin, and surgical risk of the 2 groups were similar. There was a significant decrease in total volume of red blood cells transfused (placebo group median 1460 mL vs. tranexamic acid group 1140 mL; median difference 463 mL, 95% confidence interval 15 to 914 mL, P = 0.034), with a decrease in cell saver transfusion (placebo group median 490 mL vs. tranexamic acid group 256 mL; median difference 166 mL, 95% confidence interval 0 to 368 mL, P = 0.042). The decrease in packed red blood cell transfusion did not reach statistical significance (placebo group median 1050 mL vs. tranexamic acid group 600 mL; median difference 300 mL, 95% confidence interval 0 to 600 mL, P = 0.097).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of low-dose tranexamic acid during complex multilevel spine fusion surgery to decrease total red blood cell transfusion.

AB BACKGROUND: The effects of chronic corticosteroid therapy on complications, readmission, and reoperation after posterior lumbar fusion (PLF) remain under-investigated, and were examined to determine differences in outcomes.
   METHODS: We analyzed patients undergoing PLF between 2006 and 2013 using the National Surgery Quality Improvement Program database (NSQIP). Patients taking steroids for a chronic condition were compared with those not taking steroids. Multivariable regression identified factors independently associated with complications, readmission, and reoperation. A risk score was calculated for predicting complications.
   RESULTS: A total of 8492 patients were identified, of whom 353 used steroids. The patients using steroids were older (mean age, 65.4 years vs. 61.0 years; P < 0.001), were more likely to be female (61.2% vs. 55.1%; P = 0.025), had a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists class (P < 0.001), were less likely to be functionally independent (90.3% vs. 96.5%; P < 0.001), and were more likely to have a history of hypertension (69.1% vs. 58.3%; P < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (21.8% vs. 17.4%; P = 0.033), cardiac disease (74.8% vs. 66.1%; P = 0.001), and/or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (10.5% vs. 4.2%; P < 0.001). The rates of readmission (9.4% vs. 6.0%; P = 0.023), reoperation (6.5% vs. 3.6%; P = 0.004), overall complications (14.5% vs. 9.6%; P = 0.003), and infections (9.6% vs. 5.1%; P < 0.001) were higher in the steroid group. On multivariable regression, steroids were independently associated with overall complications (odds ratio [OR], 1.38; P = 0.044) and infectious complications (OR, 1.65; P < 0.001), but not with medical complications, readmission, or reoperation. Patients with higher risk scores had higher complication rates.
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of corticosteroid therapy is associated with a moderately increased risk of overall complications, but no association was found with readmission or reoperation.

ID RADIATION NECROSIS; GLIOMA RECURRENCE; THERAPY
AB BACKGROUND: Treating recurrent posterior fossa metastases after previous radiation therapy and surgical resection remains challenging. Magnetic resonance laser-induced thermal therapy (MR-LITT) is a promising treatment for recurrent lesions, but data on safety, efficacy, and postablation volume change in the posterior fossa are lacking.
   METHODS: All patients with recurrent posterior fossa metastatic lesions treated with MR-LITT by the senior neurosurgeon were included in the study. Preoperative and postoperative follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were used to measure lesional and perilesional edema volume. These measurements were compared to calculate percent ablation volume. All patients' clinical examinations were followed closely.
   RESULTS: Four patients with recurrent cerebellar metastases were treated with MR-LITT. The average percent lesion ablated was 97.1% (range, 88.2%-100%). The average preoperative lesion volume was 3.3 cm(3) (range, 1.1-7.2 cm(3)), and the average final postoperative volume was 3.8 cm(3) (range, 0.5-7.6 cm(3)). Lesion volume increased to maximum volume on postoperative day 1, with an average increase of 486.9%. The extrapolated average time for the lesion to shrink to below the initial size was 294.5 days. There was a trend toward a decrease in average edema volume from the preoperative MRI of 17.8 cm(3) to final postoperative follow-up MRI of 3.4 cm(3) (P = 0.0952). No postoperative hydrocephalus or complications occurred.
   CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study shows that LITT appears to be a safe and promising treatment for recurrent posterior fossa metastatic lesions up to 7.2 cm(3). Further randomized controlled studies are warranted to further characterize the long-term efficacy of this therapy.

AB BACKGROUND: The natural history of hemodynamic aneurysms (HAs) associated with brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains controversial, with no single approach to treatment. The purpose of this study was to justify preventive treatment tactics for HAs that pose an increased risk of rupture based on hemodynamic studies demonstrating hypertension in the afferent bed after AVM exclusion.
   METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 131 of 1740 patients (8%) with brain AVMs and at least 1 aneurysm treated at Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute between 2000 and 2016. Treatment consisted of microsurgery, endovascular interventions, or a combination of modalities. Patients were evaluated with the modified Rankin Scale before and after treatment.
   RESULTS: A total of 205 aneurysms were discovered. Multiple HAs were found in 46 patients (35%), and were significantly more often associated with posterior fossa AVMs; in addition, most were distally located. There was no difference in the incidence of hemorrhage between proximal and distal HAs. Microsurgical treatment was marked by high radicalism; 85% of HAs and 94% of AVMs were totally excluded based on control studies. In 10 cases, aneurysms were found after AVM removal, including 4 de novo aneurysms. In 1 case, the aneurysm regressed after AVM treatment. The mortality rate was 2.3%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative imaging should be carefully examined for associated aneurysms before and after surgical treatment. Our data suggests that HA exclusion, either as the first step or simultaneously with AVM treatment, is most beneficial to patients.

ID BRAIN NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; DEFINITION
AB BACKGROUND: Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality in patients with aneurysmal sub-arachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and cerebral salt wasting (CSW) are the most common etiologies. Whether or not the location of the ruptured aneurysm is associated with the etiology of hyponatremia is unknown. We sought to determine whether or not the incidence of SIADH and CSW after aSAH differed based on aneurysm location.
   METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 335 consecutive patients who presented with aSAH at a single institution was performed. Patients were included if they developed hyponatremia before postbleed day 14. Electronic health records were reviewed to obtain data regarding aneurysm location, treatment, etiology of hyponatremia, and modified Rankin Scale score at hospital discharge.
   RESULTS: Inclusion criteria were met by 114 patients. There were 67 (59%) anterior circulation aneurysms and 47 (41%) posterior circulation aneurysms. Of patients, 85 (75%) had hyponatremia owing to SIADH, 14 (12%) had CSW, and 15 (13%) did not fit either etiology. SIADH was more common than CSW in anterior circulation aneurysms (90%) compared with posterior circulation aneurysms (75%). This trended toward, but did not reach, statistical significance (P = 0.08). More severe Hunt and Hess grades were associated with the development of CSW rather than SIADH (P = 0.002).
   CONCLUSIONS: SIADH is much more common than CSW in patients with aSAH. Anterior circulation aneurysms may be associated with a higher rate of SIADH than posterior circulation aneurysms.

AB BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have revealed an association between SRY-box 17 (SOX17) gene and intracranial aneurysm (IA) formation. However, results were mainly derived from European and Japanese populations. We investigated the association between SOX17 gene polymorphisms and IA in a homogeneous Korean population. We performed a meta-analysis to assess these results in East-Asian populations.
   METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 187 age-and sex-matched patients with IA and 372 control subjects. Genetic association analysis was performed in the generalized linear model to identify associations between 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms and IA, including 95 patients with ruptured aneurysms and 92 with unruptured aneurysms. The East-Asian meta-analysis of 5100 IA cases and 7930 control cases was conducted under an inverse variance model.
   RESULTS: Among 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms that passed quality control tests, the minor C allele of rs1072737 was significantly associated with IA (odds ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.49-0.96, P = 0.03). None of the 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms showed a significant association between patients with ruptured and unruptured aneurysms. Meta-analysis revealed that G alleles of rs10958409 and rs9298506 were significantly associated with IA in the East-Asian population after removing study heterogeneity (odds ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.19, P = 0.0023 and odds ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.32, P = 0.0016).
   CONCLUSIONS: Identification of genetic variants located near SOX17 is likely to be clinically significant for IA formation. rs10958409 and rs9298506 may increase risk of IA in East-Asian populations. Our findings may help in the identification of IA pathogenesis.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine a neurosurgeon's learning curve of surgical treatment for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients.
   METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis. Forty-six patients were treated by a single neurosurgeon between 2011 and 2017 using posterior segmental instrumentation and fusion. According to the time period, the former and latter 23 patients were divided into group 1 and group 2, respectively. Patients' demographic data, curve magnitude, number of levels treated, amount of correction achieved, radiographic/clinical outcomes, and complications were compared between the groups.
   RESULTS: The majority were females (34 vs. 12) with average ages of 15.0 versus 15.6, respectively. The mean follow-up period was 24.6 months. The average number of fusion levels was similar with 10.3 and 11.5 vertebral bodies in groups 1 and 2, respectively. The average Cobb angle of major curvature was 59.8 degrees and 58.5 degrees in groups 1 and 2, respectively. There observed significant reductions of operative time (324.4 vs. 224.7 minutes, P = 0.007) and estimated blood loss (648.3 vs. 438.0 mL, P = 0.027) in group 2. The correction rate of the major structural curve was greater in group 2 (70.7% vs. 81.0%, P = 0.001). There was no case of neurologic deficit, infection, and revision for screw malposition. One patient of group 1 underwent fusion extension surgery for shoulder asymmetry.
   CONCLUSION: Radiographic and clinical outcomes of AIS patients treated by a neurosurgeon were acceptable. AIS surgery may be performed with an acceptable rate of complications after about 20 surgeries. With acquisition of surgical experiences, neurosurgeons could perform deformity surgery for AIS effectively and safely.

AB OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord astrocytoma with intracranial dissemination carries a poor prognosis. The mechanisms leading to dissemination remain to be elucidated. A stem cell marker, CD133, was reported to predict recurrence patterns in intracranial glioblastoma. We evaluated the significance of CD133 as a putative prognostic biomarker to predict intracranial dissemination in spinal cord astrocytoma.
   METHODS: This study included 14 consecutive patients with primary spinal cord astrocytoma treated from 1998 to 2014. Six of the patients were women and the patients' ages ranged from 12 to 75 years. Seven and 6 patients underwent open biopsy and partial resection of the tumors, respectively. After confirmation of the histologic diagnoses, all patients were treated with postoperative radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of both. To identify factors predictive of intracranial dissemination, we analyzed their clinical data including Ki-67 labeling index, and CD133 expression. -
   RESULTS: Intracranial dissemination was observed in 6 of 14 patients. All 6 patients died during the follow-up period. Of the 8 patients without intracranial dissemination, 5 survived (P = 0.02). Median survival for the patients with intracranial dissemination was 22.7 months. CD133 expression was significantly higher in patients with intracranial dissemination (P = 0.04), whereas other variables did not indicate the dissemination.
   CONCLUSIONS: The expression of CD133 can be an efficient biomarker to predict intracranial dissemination in spinal cord astrocytoma. Recognition of high CD133 expression in surgical specimens and early detection of intracranial dissemination is important for the clinical management of spinal cord astrocytoma.

AB INTRODUCTION: The use of mobile exoskeletons is becoming more and more common in the field of spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation. The hybrid assistive limb (HAL) exoskeleton provides a tailored support depending on the patient's voluntary drive.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: After a pilot study in 2014 that included 8 patients with chronic SCI, this study of 21 patients with chronic SCI serves as a proof of concept. It was conducted to provide further evidence regarding the efficacy of exoskeletal-based rehabilitation. Functional assessment included walking speed, distance, and time on a treadmill, with additional analysis of functional mobility using the following tests: 10-meter walk test (10MWT), timed up and go (TUG) test, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and the walking index for SCI II (WISCI-II) score.
   RESULTS: After a training period of 90 days, all 21 patients significantly improved their functional and ambulatory mobility without the exoskeleton. Patients were assessed by the 6MWT, the TUG test, and the 10MWT, which also indicated an increase in the WISCI-II score along with significant improvements in HAL-associated walking speed, distance, and time.
   CONCLUSION: Although, exoskeletons are not yet an established treatment in the rehabilitation of spinal cord injuries, the devices will play a more important role in the future. The HAL exoskeleton training enables effective, body weight-supported treadmill training and is capable of improving ambulatory mobility. Future controlled studies are required to enable a comparison of the new advances in the field of SCI rehabilitation with traditional over-ground training.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence, bacteriologic features, and risk factors of posttranssphenoidal surgery (post-TSS) meningitis and/or bacteremia.
   METHODS: This retrospective study included 3242 patients who underwent TSS for pituitary adenoma at the Department of Neurosurgery of Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 2012 and December 2016. Clinical data for patients with and without post-TSS meningitis and/or bacteremia were compared and analyzed.
   RESULTS: Meningitis and bacteremia developed after 27 (0.8%) and 26 (0.8%) procedures, respectively, and 6 patients (0.2%) developed both. Gram-positive organisms (coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumonia, and S viridans) predominated in meningitis, whereas gram-negative organisms (Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Escherichia coli) predominated in bacteremia. All identified species were sensitive to amikacin, imipenem, and meropenem. Antibiotic treatment cured 52 patients (7 died). In a multivariate analysis, the risk of meningitis and/or bacteremia was independently associated with diabetes (P < 0.001; odds ratio [OR], 6.06), previous surgery at the same location (P < 0.001; OR, 4.23), intra-operative cerebrospinal fluid leakage (P < 0.001l; OR, 4.63), and an endoscopic approach (P = 0.001; OR, 2.50).
   CONCLUSIONS: Meningitis and/or bacteremia remain critical postoperative complications of TSS for pituitary adenoma. The pathogens with drug sensitivity to antibiotics differed between meningitis and bacteremia. Early blood and cerebrospinal fluid bacterial cultures, drug susceptibility analyses, and appropriate antibiotic treatment can help control the rate of infection.

AB BACKGROUND: Hospital length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmission rate, and other metrics are increasingly being used to evaluate quality of surgical care. The factors most relevant to cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) are not yet established.
   OBJECTIVE: To identify perioperative factors associated with extended LOS and 30-day readmission following elective surgery for CSM.
   METHODS: Surgical CSM patients at institutions represented by the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) during 2010-2012 were included. Patients with fracture, 9 or more levels fused, or cancer were excluded. Extended LOS was defined as 75th percentile of the cohort. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression identified predictors for extended LOS, 30-day readmission, and reoperation. Linear regression modeling was used to evaluate variables.
   RESULTS: Three thousand fifty-seven surgical CSM cases were isolated. Age (odds ratio [OR], 1.496), diabetes (OR, 1.691), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class (OR, 2.081), posterior surgical approach (OR, 2.695), and operative time (OR, 1.008) were all positive predictors (P < 0.05) for extended LOS (>= 4 days). Thirty-two percent of the cohort (976 patients) had 30-day readmission data. Among these, 915 patients were not readmitted (93.8%), while 61 (6.2%) were readmitted. Diabetes (OR, 1.460) and ASA class (OR, 2.539) were significant positive predictors for hospital readmission. Age (OR, 0.918) was a negative predictor of re-operation in readmitted patients, and pulmonary comorbidities (OR, 4.584) were a positive predictor (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with diabetes and higher ASA class were at increased risk for extended LOS and readmission within 30-days. Patients with increased operative time have greater risk for extended LOS. Preoperative pulmonary comorbidities increased reoperation risk, whereas increased age reduced the risk. Attention to these factors may benefit CSM patients.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Craniopharyngioma (CP) adherence represents a heterogeneous pathologic feature that critically influences the potentially safe and radical resection. The aim of this study was to define the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) predictors of CP adherence severity.
   METHODS: This study retrospectively investigated a cohort of 200 surgically treated CPs with their corresponding preoperative conventional MRI scans. MRI findings related to the distortions of anatomic structures along the sella turcica-third ventricle axis caused by CPs, in addition to the tumor's shape and calcifications, were analyzed and correlated with the definitive type of CP adherence observed during the surgical procedures.
   RESULTS: CP adherence is defined by 3 components, as follows: 1) the specific structures attached to the tumor, 2) the adhesion's extent, and 3) its strength. Combination of these 3 components determines 5 hierarchical levels of adherence severity with gradually increasing surgical risk of hypothalamic injury. Multivariate analysis identified 4 radiologic variables that allowed a correct overall prediction of the levels of CP adherence severity in 81.5% of cases: 1) the position of the hypothalamus in relation to the tumor-the most discriminant factor; 2) the type of pituitary stalk distortion; 3) the tumor shape; and 4) the presence of calcifications. A binary logistic regression model including the first 3 radiologic variables correctly identified the CPs showing the highest level of adherence severity (severe/critical) in almost 90% of cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: A position of the hypothalamus around the middle portion of the tumor, an amputated or infiltrated appearance of the pituitary stalk, and the elliptical shape of the tumor are reliable predictors of strong and extensive CP adhesions to the hypothalamus.

AB OBJECTIVES: To report the outcome of patients with very small intracranial aneurysm (VSIA) undergoing surgical clipping using a double-clip technique.
   METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Namazi Hospital, the main referral neurovascular center in Southern Iran during a 6-year period from September 2010 to March 2016. All patients with VSIAs (<= 3 mm) undergoing surgery with double-clip technique were included. This technique reduces the clip slippage. The short- and long-term outcomes determined by Glasgow outcome score (GOS), modified Rankin Scale (MRS), and complications.
   RESULTS: Operations were performed on 32 VSIAs in 26 patients with a mean +/- SD age of 55.7 +/- 10.1 years. Middle cerebral artery was the most common location for VSIA (50.0%). There was no neck remnant, and the complete occlusion rate was 100%. The rate of intraoperative aneurysm rupture was 30.8%, and none of the patients experienced rebleeding. The 6-month mortality rate was 0% in ruptured VSIAs and 6.25% in unruptured VSIAs. Most of the patients had favorable outcomes (88.5%), and the overall mortality rate was 11.5%. The rate of permanent neurologic deficit was 10.0% in ruptured and 12.5% in unruptured VSIAs. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed no association between baseline and clinical characteristics and outcome in this series.
   CONCLUSION: VSIAs are difficult to treat because of their small sizes; therefore, with a double-clip technique, one can reduce complications related to the treatment of small aneurysms.

AB BACKGROUND: The middle temporal artery (MTA) is the proximal medial branch of the superficial temporal artery (STA), supplying the temporalis muscle along with deep temporal arteries. Its use in vascularized flaps for reconstructive and otologic procedures has been described, yet its potential use in neurosurgery has not been studied. We report a novel technique for exposing the MTA and evaluated its characteristics for extracranial-eintracranial cerebrovascular bypass.
   METHODS: After a curvilinear frontotemporal incision in 10 cadaveric specimens, the STA was dissected from distal to proximal. The horizontal portion of MTA was found posterolateral to the posterior end of the zygomatic root and was followed proximally until its origin and distally until its 2 terminal branches. The total length, visible branches, and caliber of MTA were measured.
   RESULTS: The mean total harvested length of MTA was 31.7 +/- 5.1 mm, with an average proximal caliber of 1.7 +/- 0.4 mm, and distal caliber of 1.3 +/- 0.5 mm. There were 4-6 terminal MTA branches. The caliber of the proximal STA trunk was 2.5 +/- 0.5 mm. The origin of the MTA was visible with a mean distance of 16.9 +/- 4.8 mm inferior to the PEZR. The parotid gland was traversed and a communicating auriculotemporal nerve to the temporal branch of the facial nerve crossed MTA in 2 specimens.
   CONCLUSIONS: MTA can be safely harvested with an anterolateral approach, following its horizontal portion at the level of the zygomatic root, which is constant. The length and caliber of MTA makes it a potential alternative donor vessel or interposition graft for extracranial-intracranial bypass, especially when other donors are unavailable.

ID 30-DAY READMISSION; ADMINISTRATIVE DATA; STROKE
AB INTRODUCTION: The acute complications of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) often lead to readmissions, which are linked to hospital reimbursement. The national rates, causes, risk factors, and outcomes associated with 30-day and 90-day readmission after aSAH have not previously been reported.
   METHODS: The Nationwide Readmissions Database was queried from January to September 2013 for all patients (age >= 18 years) with a diagnosis of aSAH. Data points included demographics, comorbidities, complications, and discharge outcomes. Causes and risk factors for 30-day and 90-day readmission were identified in univariate and multivariable analysis.
   RESULTS: In 12,777 patients discharged alive after hospitalization for aSAH, 962 (7.5%) were readmitted within 30 days and 2153 (16.7%) within 90 days. Common causes of readmission included stroke, hydrocephalus, septicemia, and headache. At 30-day and 90-day readmission, 39.7% and 51.2% of patients with diagnosis of hydrocephalus underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, respectively. In multivariable analysis, cannabis use and diabetes were predictors of both 30-day and 90-day readmission and older patients were uniquely susceptible to 30-day readmissions. Risk factors for 90-day readmission included Medicare insurance, hypothyroidism, initial discharge to skilled nursing facility, and several index complications including bowel obstruction, gastrostomy, acute lung injury, and cerebral edema. Average cost and length of stay were calculated at 30-day ($16.647, 7.1 days) and 90-day readmission ($17,926, 6.7 days). Mortality was 2.8% within 30 days and 3.8% within 90 days.
   CONCLUSIONS: Many readmissions occur outside the 30-day follow-up period in patients subarachnoid hemorrhage and possess unique risk factors, which may help identify high-risk patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Of all specialists, neurosurgeons have the highest probability of facing a medical malpractice claim. Here we report the first specialty-wide review of malpractice claims in neurosurgery performed using a well-established national online legal database.
   METHODS: The Westlaw legal research service (Thomson Reuters, Eagan, Minnesota, USA) was queried for jury verdicts and settlements related to neurosurgery and medical malpractice between 1985 and 2015. Case files were examined, and factors recorded included the age and sex of the patient, the state and year in which the verdict was reached, defendant specialties, award payouts, and alleged reasons for malpractice. Case files were sorted into neurosurgical subspecialties based on the nature of the condition and the type of treatment administered.
   RESULTS: A total of 516 cases were identified, and 343 cases were analyzed. A defendant's verdict was reached in 165 (48.1%) cases, and a plaintiff's verdict was reached in 93 (27.1%) cases. A settlement was reached in 81 cases (23.6%). The median payout for plaintiff's verdicts was $2,550,000 (range, $80,000-$216,849,187), and that for settlements was $1,300,000 (range, $100,000-$13,300,000). Procedural error (45.5%), a failure to diagnose (41.4%), or a failure to treat (42.9%) were the most commonly cited reasons for litigation. Neurosurgeons accounted for 21.1% of defendants. The median plaintiff award payout was highest for pediatric cases ($10,100,000).
   CONCLUSIONS: A defendant's verdict was reached in nearly one-half of the cases. In instances where a plaintiff's verdict was reached, large payouts were common, especially in pediatric and cerebrovascular cases. An emphasis on reducing procedural error, and making timely differential diagnoses, may reduce future litigation.

AB BACKGROUND: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) induces widespread inflammation leading to cellular injury, vasospasm, and ischemia. Evidence suggests that progesterone (PROG) can improve functional recovery in acute brain injury owing to its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, which could also be beneficial in SAH. We hypothesized that PROG treatment attenuates inflammation-mediated cerebral vasospasm and microglial activation, improves synaptic connectivity, and ameliorates functional recovery after SAH.
   METHODS: We investigated the effect of PROG in a cisternal SAH model in adult male C57BL/6 mice. Neurobehavioral outcomes were evaluated using rotarod latency and grip strength tests. Basilar artery perimeter, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1)/synaptophysin colocalization, and Iba-1 immunoreactivity were quantified histologically.
   RESULTS: PROG (8 mg/kg) significantly improved rotarod latency at day 6 and grip strength at day 9. PROG-treated mice had significantly reduced basilar artery vasospasm at 24 hours. GluR1/synaptophysin colocalization, indicative of synaptic GluR1, was significantly reduced in the SAH+Vehicle group at 24 hours, and PROG treatment significantly attenuated this reduction. PROG treatment significantly reduced microglial cell activation and proliferation in cerebellum and cortex but not in the brainstem at 10 days.
   CONCLUSIONS: PROG treatment ameliorated cerebral vasospasm, reduced microglial activation, restored synaptic GluR1 localization, and improved neurobehavioral performance in a murine model of SAH. These results provide a rationale for further translational testing of PROG therapy in SAH.

ID INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; MANAGEMENT; STRATEGIES; WALL
AB BACKGROUND: Supraclinoid blister aneurysms (BAs) of the internal carotid artery are uncommon and deadly, and appropriate treatment is controversial. Endovascular reconstruction may allow treatment through aneurysm isolation. We report a single-institution experience in the use of Enterprise stent-assisted coiling (ESAC) for treating BAs to appraise the safety and efficacy of this technique.
   METHODS: Patients treated with ESAC for a BA at our institution between 2013 and 2016 were retrospectively included in this study. Patients' aneurysm characteristics, progression status, aneurysm occlusion on follow-up angiography, and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score were recorded and analyzed. Occlusion rates and neurologic outcomes were compared between patients treated with a single stent and those treated with multiple telescoping stents.
   RESULTS: Forty-four patients were included (17 males; average age, 47.3 years), and ESAC was successfully performed in all patients. Immediate postprocedure angiography revealed complete occlusion in 23 patients (52.3%), residual neck in 15 (34.1%), and residual aneurysm in 6 (13.6%). Twenty patients (45.5%) suffered perioperative cerebral vasospasm, and 3 (6.8%) died of secondary ischemic stroke. The duration of follow-up ranged from 2.5 to 27 months (mean, 11.59 +/- 5.76 months). One patient with recurrence was treated with additional coiling, and another patient was treated with a covered stent. The use of telescoping stents was associated with a better complete aneurysm occlusion rate compared with the use of single stents (84.4% [27 of 34] vs. 44.4% [4 of 9]; P = 0.04). Follow-up mRS score was <= 1 for 32 of 41 patients (78.4%).
   CONCLUSIONS: ESAC to treat BAs is safe, effective, and provides good clinical outcomes. ESAC with telescoping stents has a higher follow-up complete occlusion rate compared with ESAC with single stents.

AB BACKGROUND: Sedation therapy is vital for treating severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Yet, types of sedation assessment tools and sedation levels that are suitable for sedation treatment have not been investigated.
   OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of different sedation levels guided by the Bispectral Index (BIS) on the therapeutic effects for severe TBI.
   METHODS: According to inclusion, exclusion, and rejection criteria, 35 patients were prospectively included and divided into Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), BIS(I), and BIS(II) groups. The RASS group was controlled the level of sedation to within -2 or -3, and the BIS(I) and (II) groups within the range of 40-50 and 50-60, respectively. In addition to clinical data, RASS, BIS, and intracranial pressure (ICP) values were collected. RASS and ICP variability were introduced to investigate the different of sedative control effect with or without BIS monitor, and the control effect of ICP between different sedation levels. Statistical analysis was performed to estimate the effectiveness of different sedation levels guided by BIS in sedation treatment within 72 hours.
   RESULTS: There were no significant differences in de-mographics among the 3 groups. RASS variability of the BIS(I) and (II) groups was significantly lower than that of the RASS group (P < 0.05), and in the BIS(I) group it was insignificantly lower than in the BIS(II) group. The ICP of the BIS(I) and (II) groups declined to < 13.5 mm Hg significantly earlier than that of the RASS group (P < 0.05), and the difference between BIS(I) and (II) was insignificant. ICP variability of RASS group was higher than those of the BIS(I) and (II) groups (P < 0.05), and ICP variability of the BIS(I) group was significantly lower than that of the BIS(II) group (P < 0.05). Differences in days in the neurosurgery intensive care unit and outcomes among the 3 groups were insignificant.
   CONCLUSIONS: BIS is more reliable than RASS for maintaining a stable sedation status and ICP. Deeper sedation levels (BIS 40-50) cause ICP to decrease more quickly, with lower ICP variability.

   ETIOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND: Microvascular decompression (MVD) is useful treatment for hemifacial spasm (HFS) with refractory hypertension (RHTN). The biomedical glue sling technique is a new method for MVD. In this study, we retrospectively compared the outcome of the biomedical glue sling technique with traditional technique in MVD for HFS with RHTN.
   METHODS: A retrospective study of HFS with RHTN treated by MVD was conducted between January 2010 and June 2016. Among 155 patients who underwent their first MVD at our institution, traditional technique was performed in 73 cases of patients and the biomedical glue sling technique was performed on 82 patients.
   RESULTS: At 3 days, 7 days, 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year after MVD surgery, in the traditional technique group the effective rates of MVD for HFS were 86.30%, 84.93%, 87.14%, 84.06%, and 83.33%. The effective rates for RHTN were 68.49%, 67.12%, 65.71%, 57.97%, and 57.58%. The incidence rates of complication were 5.48%, 5.48%, 4.29%, 2.90%, and 3.03%. In the biomedical glue sling technique group, the effective rates of MVD for HFS were 97.56%, 97.56%, 98.75%, 96.15%, and 94.59% (P < 0.05). The effective rates for RHTN were 85.37%, 82.93%, 81.25%, 79.49%, and 75.68% (P < 0.05). The incidence rates of complication were 6.10%, 6.10%, 5.00%, 3.85%, and 2.70% (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSION: When HFS is associated with RHTN, the efficacy of the biomedical glue sling technique for MVD is higher than that of the traditional technique for both HFS and RHTN.

   Region: Anatomic Study and Clinical Applications
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

ID TRANSSPHENOIDAL APPROACH
AB BACKGROUND: Complications of the internal carotid artery (ICA) in surgery are rare but severe. This study aimed to locate the ICA with 5 stationary bony structures in the sellar region: the anterior clinoid process, the tuberculum sellae, the bottom of the hypophyseal fossa, the posterior edge of the hypophyseal fossa, and the postclinoid process and to do measurements to determine their anatomic relationship with the ICA.
   METHODS: After multiple planar reconstructions on computer tomographic angiography images of 120 ICA in 60 individuals, we defined the 5 bony structures as 5 origins in the horizontal, sagittal, and vertical planes with the 3D coordinate system and got the cross-sections of bilateral ICA on the coronal plane passing through each origin. We measured the distances between the cross-sections and the origins and angles between the horizontal plane and the line passing through the origin and the cross-sections on each coronal plane. We also measured the distances between the bilateral ICA on the 5 coronal planes. Besides, we measured the coordinate of the anterior edge of bilateral ICA, taking the anterior clinoid process as the origin.
   RESULTS: With the 3-dimensional coordinate system, we located the ICA to the bony structures in skull base. The distance between the bilateral ICA on coronal planes were 18.8 +/- 2.9 mm, 23.6 +/- 3.7 mm, 19.9 +/- 3.4 mm, 24.7 +/- 4.3 mm, and 23.5 +/- 3.5 mm, from anterior to posterior, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: The 3D coordinate system used in this study is of value in preoperational assessment, and data we obtained indicate the safety ranges avoiding damage to the ICA in surgery.

AB In this paper, a Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM) based approach is proposed to evaluate and monitor body motion during a rehabilitation training program. The approach extracts clinically relevant motion features from skeleton joint trajectories, acquired by the RGB-D camera, and provides a score for the subject's performance. The approach combines different aspects of rule and template based methods. The features have been defined by clinicians as exercise descriptors and are then assessed by a HSMM, trained upon an exemplar motion sequence. The reliability of the proposed approach is studied by evaluating its correlation with both a clinical assessment and a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm, while healthy and neurological disabled people performed physical exercises. With respect to the discrimination between healthy and pathological conditions, the HSMM based method correlates better with the physician's score than DTW. The study supports the use of HSMMs to assess motor performance providing a quantitative feedback to physiotherapist and patients. This result is particularly appropriate and useful for a remote assessment in the home.

AB Poor usability of health technology is thought to diminish work system performance, increase error rates and, potentially, harm patients. The present study (i) used a combination of usability evaluation methods to highlight the chain that leads from usability flaws to usage problems experienced by users and, ultimately, to negative patient outcomes, and (ii) validated this approach by studying two different discharge summary production systems. To comply with quality guidelines, the process of drafting and sending discharge summaries is increasingly being automated. However, the usability of these systems may modify their impact (or the absence thereof) in terms of production times and quality, and must therefore be evaluated. Here, we applied three successive techniques for usability evaluation (heuristic evaluation, user testing and field observation) to two discharge summary production systems (underpinned by different technologies). The systems' main usability flaws led respectively to an increase in the time need to produce a discharge summary and the risk of patient misidentification. Our results are discussed with regard to the possibility of linking the usability flaws, usage problems and the negative outcomes by successively applying three methods for evaluating usability (heuristic evaluation, user testing and in situ observations) throughout the system development life cycle.

AB The application of wireless devices has led to a significant improvement in the quality delivery of care in telemedicine systems. Patients who live in a remote area are able to communicate with the healthcare provider and benefit from the doctor consultations. However, it has been a challenge to provide a secure telemedicine system, which captures users (patients and doctors) mobility and patient privacy. In this work, we present several secure protocols for telemedicine systems, which ensure the secure communication between patients and doctors who are located in different geographical locations. Our protocols are the first of this kind featured with confidentiality of patient information, mutual authentication, patient anonymity, data integrity, freshness of communication, and mobility. Our protocols are based on symmetric-key schemes and capture all desirable security requirements in order to better serve our objectives of research for secure telemedicine services; therefore, they are very efficient in implementation. A comparison with related works shows that our work contributes first comprehensive solution to capture user mobility and patient privacy for telemedicine systems.

AB Modern medical information systems enable the collection of massive temporal health data. Albeit these data have great potentials for advancing medical research, the data exploration and extraction of useful knowledge present significant challenges. In this work, we develop a new pattern matching technique which aims to facilitate the discovery of clinically useful knowledge from large temporal datasets. Our approach receives in input a set of temporal patterns modeling specific events of interest (e.g., doctor's knowledge, symptoms of diseases) and it returns data instances matching these patterns (e.g., patients exhibiting the specified symptoms). The resulting instances are ranked according to a significance score based on the p-value. Our experimental evaluations on a real-world dataset demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.

ID MISSING DATA; DISEASE; VISUALIZATION; PREDICTION; TIME; TOOL
AB Aims: Despite growing interest in using electronic health records (EHR) to create longitudinal cohort studies, the distribution and missingness of EHR data might introduce selection bias and information bias to such analyses. We aimed to examine the yield and potential for these healthcare process biases in defining a study baseline using EHR data, using the example of cholesterol and blood pressure (BP) measurements.
   Methods: We created a virtual cohort study of cardiovascular disease (CVD) from patients with eligible cholesterol profiles in the New England (NE) and Southeast (SE) networks of the Veterans Health Administration in the United States. Using clinical data from the EHR, we plotted the yield of patients with BP measurements within an expanding timeframe around an index date of cholesterol testing. We compared three groups: (1) patients with BP from the exact index date; (2) patients with BP not on the index date but within the network specific 90th percentile around the index date; and (3) patients with no BP within the network-specific 90th percentile.
   Results: Among 589,361 total patients in the two networks, 146,636 (61.0%) of 240,479 patients from NE and 289,906 (83.1%) of 348,882 patients from SE had BP measurements on the index date. Ninety percent had BP measured within 11 days of the index date in NE and within 5 days of the index date in SE. Group 3 in both networks had fewer available race data, fewer comorbidities and CVD medications, and fewer health system encounters.
   Conclusions: Requiring same-day risk factor measurement in the creation of a virtual CVD cohort study from EHR data might exclude 40% of eligible patients, but including patients with infrequent visits might introduce bias. Data visualization can inform study-specific strategies to address these challenges for the research use of EHR data.

AB Objectives: A coordinated collaboration among different healthcare professionals in Emergency Room (ER) processes is critical to promptly care for patients who arrive at the hospital in a delicate health condition, claiming for an immediate attention. The aims of this study are (i) to discover role interaction models in (ER) processes using process mining techniques; (ii) to understand how healthcare professionals are currently collaborating; and (iii) to provide useful knowledge that can help to improve ER processes.
   Methods: A four step method based on process mining techniques is proposed. An ER process of a university hospital was considered as a case study, using 7160 episodes that contains specific ER episode attributes.
   Results: Insights about how healthcare professionals collaborate in the ER was discovered, including the identification of a prevalent role interaction model along the major triage categories and specific role interaction models for different diagnoses. Also, common and exceptional professional interaction models were discovered at the role level.
   Conclusions: This study allows the discovery of role interaction models through the use of real-life clinical data and process mining techniques. Results show a useful way of providing relevant insights about how healthcare professionals collaborate, uncovering opportunities for process improvement.

ID LANGUAGE
AB To date, the methods developed for automated extraction of information from radiology reports are mainly rule based or dictionary-based, and, therefore, require substantial manual effort to build these systems. Recent efforts to develop automated systems for entity detection have been undertaken, but little work has been done to automatically extract relations and their associated named entities in narrative radiology reports that have comparable accuracy to rule-based methods. Our goal is to extract relations in a unsupervised way from radiology reports without specifying prior domain knowledge. We propose a hybrid approach for information extraction that combines dependency-based parse tree with distributed semantics for generating structured information frames about particular findings/abnormalities from the free-text mammography reports. The proposed IE system obtains a F-1-score of 0.94 in terms of completeness of the content in the information frames, which outperforms a state-of-the-art rule-based system in this domain by a significant margin. The proposed system can be leveraged in a variety of applications, such as decision support and information retrieval, and may also easily scale to other radiology domains, since there is no need to tune the system with hand-crafted information extraction rules.

AB We study the question of how to represent or summarize raw laboratory data taken from an electronic health record (EHR) using parametric model selection to reduce or cope with biases induced through clinical care. It has been previously demonstrated that the health care process (Hripcsak and Albers, 2012, 2013), as defined by -measurement context (Hripcsak and Albers, 2013; Albers et al., 2012) and measurement patterns (Albers and Hripcsak, 2010, 2012), can influence how EHR data are distributed statistically (Kohane and Weber, 2013; Pivovarov et al., 2014). We construct an algorithm, PopKLD, which is based on information criterion model selection (Burnham and Anderson, 2002; Claeskens and Hjort, 2008), is intended to reduce and cope with health care process biases and to produce an intuitively understandable continuous summary. The PopKLD algorithm can be automated and is designed to be applicable in high-throughput settings; for example, the output of the PopKLD algorithm can be used as input for phenotyping algorithms. Moreover, we develop the PopKLD-CAT algorithm that transforms the continuous PopKLD summary into a categorical summary useful for applications that require categorical data such as topic modeling. We evaluate our methodology in two ways. First, we apply the method to laboratory data collected in two different health care contexts, primary versus intensive care. We show that the PopKLD preserves known physiologic features in the data that are lost when summarizing the data using more common laboratory data summaries such as mean and standard deviation. Second, for three disease laboratory measurement pairs, we perform a phenotyping task: we use the PopKLD and PopKLD-CAT algorithms to define high and low values of the laboratory variable that are used for defining a disease state. We then compare the relationship between the PopKLD-CAT summary disease predictions and the same predictions using empirically estimated mean and standard deviation to a gold standard generated by clinical review of patient records. We find that the PopKLD laboratory data summary is substantially better at predicting disease state. The PopKLD or PopKLD-CAT algorithms are not meant to be used as phenotyping algorithms, but we use the phenotyping task to show what information can be gained when using a more informative laboratory data summary. In the process of evaluation our method we show that the different clinical contexts and laboratory measurements necessitate different statistical summaries. Similarly, leveraging the principle of maximum entropy we argue that while some laboratory data only have sufficient information to estimate a mean and standard deviation, other laboratory data captured in an EHR contain substantially more information than can be captured in higher-parameter models.

AB Managers in complex organisations often have to make decisions on whether new software developments are worth undertaking or not. Such decisions are hard to make, especially at an enterprise level. Both costs and risks are regularly underestimated, despite the existence of a plethora of software and systems engineering methodologies aimed at predicting and controlling them. Our objective is to help managers and stakeholders of large, complex organisations (like the National Health Service in the UK) make better informed decisions on the costs and risks of planned new software systems that will reuse or extend their existing information infrastructure.
   We analysed case studies describing new software developments undertaken by providers of health care services in the UK, looking for common points of risk and high cost. The results highlighted the movement of data within and between organisations as a key factor. Data movement can be hindered by numerous technical barriers, but also by other challenges arising from social aspects of the organisation. These latter aspects are often harder to predict, and are ignored by many of the more common software engineering methodologies.
   In this paper, we propose data journey modelling, a new method aiming to predict places of high cost and risk when existing data needs to move to a new development. The method is lightweight and combines technical and social aspects, but relies only on information that is likely to be already known to key stakeholders, or will be cheap to acquire.
   To assess the effectiveness of our method, we conducted a retrospective evaluation in an NHS Foundation Trust hospital. Using the method, we were able to predict most of the points of high cost/risk that the hospital staff had identified, along with several other possible directions that the staff did not identify for themselves, but agreed could be promising.

AB The quality of usability testing is highly dependent upon the associated usability scenarios. To promote usability testing as part of electronic health record (EHR) certification, the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) for Health Information Technology requires that vendors test specific capabilities of EHRs with clinical end-users and report their usability testing process - including the test scenarios used - along with the results. The ONC outlines basic expectations for usability testing, but there is little guidance in usability texts or scientific literature on how to develop usability scenarios for healthcare applications. The objective of this article is to outline key factors to consider when developing usability scenarios and tasks to evaluate computer-interface based health information technologies. To achieve this goal, we draw upon a decade of our experience conducting usability tests with a variety of healthcare applications and a wide range of end-users, to include healthcare professionals as well as patients. We discuss 10 key factors that influence scenario development: objectives of usability testing; roles of end-user(s); target performance goals; evaluation time constraints; clinical focus; fidelity; scenario-related bias and confounders; embedded probes; minimize risks to end-users; and healthcare related outcome measures. For each factor, we present an illustrative example. This article is intended to aid usability researchers and practitioners in their efforts to advance health information technologies. The article provides broad guidance on usability scenario development and can be applied to a wide range of clinical information systems and applications.

AB Computer-based clinical decision support (CDS) has been pursued for more than five decades. Despite notable accomplishments and successes, wide adoption and broad use of CDS in clinical practice has not been achieved. Many issues have been identified as being partially responsible for the relatively slow adoption and lack of impact, including deficiencies in leadership, recognition of purpose, understanding of human interaction and workflow implications of CDS, cognitive models of the role of CDS, and proprietary implementations with limited interoperability and sharing.
   To address limitations, many approaches have been proposed and evaluated, drawing on theoretical frameworks, as well as management, technical and other disciplines and experiences. It seems clear, because of the multiple perspectives involved, that no single model or framework is adequate to encompass these challenges. This Viewpoint paper seeks to review the various foci of CDS and to identify aspects in which theoretical models and frameworks for CDS have been explored or could be explored and where they might be expected to be most useful.

AB From the perspective of clinical decision-making in a Medical IoT-based healthcare system, achieving effective and efficient analysis of long-term health data for supporting wise clinical decision-making is an extremely important objective, but determining how to effectively deal with the multi-dimensionality and high volume of generated data obtained from Medical IoT-based healthcare systems is an issue of increasing importance in IoT healthcare data exploration and management. A novel classifier or predicator equipped with a good feature selection function contributes effectively to classification and prediction performance. This paper proposes a novel bagging C4.5 algorithm based on wrapper feature selection, for the purpose of supporting wise clinical decision-making in the medical and healthcare fields. In particular, the new proposed sampling method, S-C4.5 SMOTE, is not only able to overcome the problem of data distortion, but also improves overall system performance because its mechanism aims at effectively reducing the data size without distortion, by keeping datasets balanced and technically smooth. This achievement directly supports the Wrapper method of effective feature selection without the need to consider the problem of huge amounts of data; this is a novel innovation in this work.

AB The development of Internet of Things (loT) and latest Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have changed the nature of healthcare monitoring and health behaviour intervention in many applications. Water hygiene and water conservation behaviour intervention as important influence factors to human health are gaining much attentions for improving sustained sanitation practice. Based on face-to-face delivery, typical behaviour intervention method is costly and hardly to provide all day access to personalised intervention guidance and feedbacks. In this study, we presented a behavioural information system and water use behaviour model using loT platform. Using Expanded Theory of Planned Behaviour (ETPB) and adopted structure equation model, this study offers a solution for understanding the behaviour intervention mechanism and methodology for developing empirical model. A case study of behaviour intervention model is presented by utilising residential water conservation behaviour data collected in China. Results suggested that cultural differences have significant influences on the understanding of intervention drivers, promoting projects and increasing awareness, which could improve the behaviour intervention efficiency and further facilitate the improvement of water hygiene practice. The performance evaluation of water saving dimension is discussed as well in the paper.

AB SNOMED CT terminology is not backed by standard norms of encoding among pathologists. The vast number of concepts ordered in hierarchies and axes, together with the lack of rules of use, complicates the functionality of SNOMED CT for coding, extracting, and analyzing the data. Defining subgroups of SNOMED CT by discipline could increase its functionality. The challenge lies in how to choose the concepts to be included in a subset from a total of over 300,000. Besides, SNOMED CT does not cover daily need, as the clinical reality is dynamic and changing. To adapt SNOMED CT to needs in a flexible way, the possibility exists to create extensions.
   In Catalonia, most pathology departments have been migrating from SNOMED II to SNOMED CT in a bid to advance the development of the Catalan Pathology Registry, which was created in 2014 as a repository for all the pathological diagnoses. This article explains the methodology used to: (a) identify the clinico-pathological entities and the molecular diagnostic procedures not included in SNOMED CT; (b) define the theoretical subset and microglossary of pathology; (c) describe the SNOMED CT concepts used by pathologists of 1.17 million samples of the Catalan Pathology Registry; and (d) adapt the theoretical subset and the microglossary according to the actual use of SNOMED CT.
   Of the 328,365 concepts available for coding the diagnoses (326,732 in SNOMED CT and 1576 in Catalan extension), only 2% have been used. Combining two axes of SNOMED CT, body structure and clinical findings, has enabled coding most of the morphologies.

TI Auditing SNOMED CT hierarchical relations based on lexical features of
   concepts in non-lattice subgraphs
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS

DE Biomedical ontologies; SNOMED CT; Quality assurance; Non-lattice
   subgraphs; Lexical attributes
ID ABSTRACTION NETWORK; COMPLEX CONCEPTS
AB Objective: We introduce a structural-lexical approach for auditing SNOMED CT using a combination of non lattice subgraphs of the underlying hierarchical relations and enriched lexical attributes of fully specified concept names. Our goal is to develop a scalable and effective approach that automatically identifies missing hierarchical IS-A relations.
   Methods: Our approach involves 3 stages. In stage 1, all non-lattice subgraphs of SNOMED CT's IS-A hierarchical relations are extracted. In stage 2, lexical attributes of fully-specified concept names in such non-lattice sub graphs are extracted. For each concept in a non-lattice subgraph, we enrich its set of attributes with attributes from its ancestor concepts within the non-lattice subgraph. In stage 3, subset inclusion relations between the lexical attribute sets of each pair of concepts in each non-lattice subgraph are compared to existing IS-A relations in SNOMED CT. For concept pairs within each non-lattice subgraph, if a subset relation is identified but an IS-A relation is not present in SNOMED CT IS-A transitive closure, then a missing IS-A relation is reported. The September 2017 release of SNOMED CT (US edition) was used in this investigation.
   Results: A total of 14,380 non-lattice subgraphs were extracted, from which we suggested a total of 41,357 missing IS-A relations. For evaluation purposes, 200 non-lattice subgraphs were randomly selected from 996 smaller subgraphs (of size 4, 5, or 6) within the "Clinical Finding" and "Procedure" sub-hierarchies. Two domain experts confirmed 185 (among 223) suggested missing IS-A relations, a precision of 82.96%.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that analyzing the lexical features of concepts in non-lattice subgraphs is an effective approach for auditing SNOMED CT.

AB Computational protein design methods have enabled the design of novel protein structures, but they are often still limited to small proteins and symmetric systems. To expand the size of designable proteins while controlling the overall structure, we developed Elfin, a genetic algorithm for the design of novel proteins with custom shapes using structural building blocks derived from experimentally verified repeat proteins. By combining building blocks with compatible interfaces, it is possible to rapidly build non-symmetric large structures (>1000 amino acids) that match three-dimensional geometric descriptions provided by the user. A run time of about 20 min on a laptop computer for a 3000 amino acid structure makes Elfin accessible to users with limited computational resources. Protein structures with controlled geometry will allow the systematic study of the effect of spatial arrangement of enzymes and signaling molecules, and provide new scaffolds for functional nanomaterials.

AB In recent years, a number of new protein structures that possess tandem repeats have emerged. Many of these proteins are comprised of tandem arrays of beta-hairpins. Today, the amount and variety of the data on these beta-hairpin repeat (BHR) structures have reached a level that requires detailed analysis and further classification. In this paper, we classified the BHR proteins, compared structures, sequences of repeat motifs, functions and distribution across the major taxonomic kingdoms of life and within organisms. As a result, we identified six different BHR folds in tandem repeat proteins of Class III (elongated structures) and one BHR fold (up-and-down beta-barrel) in Class IV ("closed" structures). Our survey reveals the high incidence of the BHR proteins among bacteria and viruses and their possible relationship to the structures of amyloid fibrils. It indicates that BHR folds will be an attractive target for future structural studies, especially in the context of age-related amyloidosis and emerging infectious diseases. This work allowed us to update the RepeatsDB database, which contains annotated tandem repeat protein structures and to construct sequence profiles based on BHR structural alignments.

AB An integrin-like beta-propeller domain contains seven repeats of a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet motif (blades). Previously we described a 3D structural motif within each blade of the integrin-type beta-propeller. Here, we show unique structural links that join different blades of the beta-propeller structure, which together with the structural motif for a single blade are repeated in a beta-propeller to provide the functional top face of the barrel, found to be involved in protein-protein interactions and substrate recognition. We compare functional top face diagrams of the integrin-type beta-propeller domain and two non-integrin type beta-propeller domains of virginiamycin B lyase and WD Repeat-Containing Protein 5.

To reveal the unique physical features of repeat proteins we have studied the structural and mechanical properties of three repeats of chicken brain alpha-spectrin (R15, R16 and R17) at the atomic level under stretching at constant velocities (0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 angstrom.ps(-1)) and constant forces (700 and 900 pN) using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at T = 300 K. 114 independent MD simulations were performed and their analysis has been done. Despite structural similarity of these domains we have found that R15 is less mechanically stable than R16, which is less stable than R17. This result is in agreement with the thermal unfolding rates. Moreover, we have observed the relationship between mechanical stability, flexibility of the domains and the number of aromatic residues involved in aromatic clusters.

TI The repeat structure of two paralogous genes, Yersinia ruckeri invasin

AB Inverse autotransporters comprise the recently identified type Ve secretion system and are exemplified by intimin from enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli and invasin from enteropathogenic Yersiniae. These proteins share a common domain architecture and promote bacterial adhesion to host cells. Here, we identified and characterized two putative inverse autotransporter genes in the fish pathogen Yersinia ruckeri NVH_3758, namely yrInv (for Y. ruckeri invasin) and yrIlm (for Y. ruckeri invasin-like molecule). When trying to clone the highly repetitive genes for structural and functional studies, we experienced problems in obtaining PCR products. PCR failures and the highly repetitive nature of inverse autotransporters prompted us to sequence the genome of Y. ruckeri NVH_3758 using PacBio sequencing, which produces some of the longest average read lengths available in the industry at this moment. According to our sequencing data, YrIlm is composed of 2603 amino acids (7812 bp) and has a molecular mass of 256.4 kDa. Based on the new genome information, we performed PCR analysis on four non-sequenced Y. ruckeri strains as well as the sequenced. Y. ruckeri type strain. We found that the genes are variably present in the strains, and that the length of yrIlm, when present, also varies. In addition, the length of the gene product for all strains, including the type strain, was much longer than expected based on deposited sequences. The internal repeats of the yrInv gene product are highly diverged, but represent the same bacterial immunoglobulin-like domains as in yrIlm. Using qRT-PCR, we found that yrIlm and yrInv are differentially expressed under conditions relevant for pathogenesis. In addition, we compared the genomic context of both genes in the newly sequenced Y. ruckeri strain to all available PacBio-sequenced Y. ruckeri genomes, and found indications of recent events of horizontal gene transfer. Taken together, this study demonstrates and highlights the power of Single Molecule Real-Time technology for sequencing highly repetitive proteins, and sheds light on the genetic events that gave rise to these highly repetitive genes in a commercially important fish pathogen.

AB Large Li2BaAl2F10 single crystals of optical quality were grown using the vertical Bridgman method. X-ray diffraction method was used to determine the crystal structure (orthorhombic symmetry Cmc2(1)), lattice parameters, atomic coordinates. The luminescent properties were investigated using selective photo excitation by synchrotron radiation (E = 3.7-21 eV, T = 8 K, time integrated and time-resolved spectra) as well as upon excitation with unfiltered X-ray beam (synchrotron radiation or X-ray tube). We revealed both the broadband luminescence at E (m) = 4.0 eV (E (ex)=11.72 eV) attributed to the radiative annihilation of self-trapped excitons (STE) and the excitonic-type near-defect luminescence at E (m) = 3.0-3.2 eV (E (ex)=11.25 eV) attributed to radiative relaxation of electronic excitations in nonequivalent structural units of the crystal lattice. The fast exponential component with lifetime of 5.6 ns, a low-intensity intermediate component with a lifetime of 75-100 ns, a constant level - pedestal (sum of the micro- and millisecond decay components) were revealed in luminescence decay kinetics. The electronic structure parameters (bandgap E (g) = 13.0 eV, low-energy onset of the intrinsic host absorption E (c) = 11.2 eV), the energy threshold for the excitation of STE-luminescence (E t(h) = 11.2 eV) are determined from spectroscopic data. Thermoluminescence cm has been studied (90-350 K) using spectral-integral regime. Four partially overlapping TL glow peaks were revealed, their deconvolution was done and thermal activation parameters were determined using TGCD method. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) from disperse orange 11 (DO11) dye-doped polylactic acid (PLA) was used to monitor photodegradation while the material was being damaged by a strong pump laser. The ASE signal fully recovers over two hours time when the pump beam is blocked. The fluorescence spectra was also observed to recover after partial photobleaching the dye-doped polymer.

Using a b-cut sample, a maximum output power of 181 mW is achieved at similar to 747 nm with slope efficiency of 12.7% with respect to the absorbed power. Using a c-cut sample, a dual-wavelength laser at similar to 743 and similar to 753 nm is obtained with a total maximum output power of 72 mW by using the blue diode pumping, for the first time to our knowledge. These laser emissions are all linearly polarized and M-2\ factors of these output laser beams are also measured.

AB Transition metal-doped lead sulfide nanoparticles (PbS-NPs) were synthesized by co-precipitation method. The crystallite phase and morphological studies were carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Optical studies were performed by UV-Visible absorption, fluorescence emission spectroscopy and Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). XRD analysis reveals that the pure and transition metal-doped PbS- NPs have a single crystalline phase with cubic structure devoided of any other secondary phase. The notable effect on optical absorbance and band gap was observed with transition metal doping in lead sulphide. The optical energy band gap values were found to increase with the doping of transition metal. UV Visible absorption and fluorescence emission spectra display a blue shift with subsequent transition metal doping which may arise due to quantum confinement effect making it worth for having applications in optoelectronic devices.

AB In this study, we developed Li3PO4-B2O3 glasses doped with different concentrations of Tb (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 10.0%) as well as undoped glass, and then the prepared glasses were studied for the optical, dosimeter and scintillator properties. The Tb-doped samples indicated radioluminescence and photoluminescence (PL) due to the 4f-4f transitions of Tb3+ with sharp spectral features peaking around 375, 410, 435, 480, 540, 590 and 620 nm. The luminescence decay times of radioluminescence and PL were 23 -2.7 ms and 2.7-2.9 ms, respectively. The shorter radioluminescence decay time than that of PL indicated quenching effect of excited states in radioluminescence. As the concentration of Tb increased, both the radioluminescence intensity and PL quantum yield (QY) increased, and the 10.0% Tb-doped sample showed the highest radioluminescence intensity and QY (54.3%). In addition, thermally-stimulated luminescence (TSL) was observed after irradiating with X-rays. The sensitivity was the highest for the 3.0% Tb-doped sample having a dynamic range from 0.1 mGy to 10 Gy, which was equivalent to commercial dosimeters. The comprehensive studies suggested that X-ray generated charges are captured at TSL-active centers more effectively at lower concentrations of Tb whereas the recombination probability at Tb center during irradiation increases with the concentration of Tb. Consequently, the optimal Tb concentration was 10% as scintillator and 3.0% for TSL dosimeter, among the present samples. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The investigation of the fluorescence intensity ratio and the lifetime thermometry techniques for two rare earth perovskites-type oxide (LaGdO3:Er3+ and LaGdO3:Er3+/Yb3+) has been carried out. We have demonstrated that the intensity ratio of thermally coupled levels of erbium (H-2(11/2) and S-4(3/2)) is temperature dependant in the range from 283 to 393 K. The sensitivity parameter was found to reach a maximum value of 31 x 10(-4) K-1 and 34 x 10(-4) K-1 at 393 K and the temperature resolution to be equivalent to 1.61 and 3.1 K, for Er3+ and Er3+/Yb3+ doped oxide, respectively. By studying the temperature dependence of the normalized lifetimes in the range from 293 to 348 K, we proved that the sensitivity of the green emission (S-4(3/2)) is higher than the red one (F-4(9/2)) for both samples, and that it increases from 144 x 10(-4) K-1 for LaGdO3:Er3+ to 179 x 10(-4) K-1 for LaGdO3:Er3+/Yb3+. The thermal coefficients were quite large in comparison to those calculated for different luminescent materials and reported in literature. The repeatability of measurements was tested by performing heating and cooling cycles for both methods and the results show that these optical techniques have a good repeatability performance. Hence, the LaGdO3: Er3+, Yb3+ oxide has a precise and a satisfying sensitivity associated to a good thermal and chemical stability, suggesting that it can be a potential candidate in temperature sensing.

AB Tetrathia-rubyrin and graphene oxide (GO) covalent adduct was synthesized, characterised and optical properties were studied. GO-Rubyrin adducts showed fluorescence quenching of rubyrin clue to electron or energy transfer from rubyrin to graphene oxide, which also reflected in UV-vis absorbance spectroscopy. The non-linear optical responses were measured through Z scan technique in nano-second regime. The enhanced optical non-linearity was observed after attachment of GO with rubyrin, can be ascribed to the photo-induced electron or energy transfer from the electron rich rubyrin moiety to the electron deficient GO.

AB Nanostructured CeO2:Eu3+ was synthesized by low temperature thermolysis (500 degrees C, 1 h) of RE3+-benzenetricarboxylate precursors (RE: Rare Earth). This preparation method is shown to produce easily dispersible highly crystalline nanoparticles with sharp crystallite size distribution, presenting large advantage over widespread available processes. The resulting nanomaterial (empty set 7-48 nm obtained from TEM and PXRD analysis) presents exclusively Ce-IV oxidation state according to XANES measurements. The doping process provides a solid solution with Eu3+ occupying the octahedral Celv site, indicated by the photoluminescent characterization of the nanoparticles. The use of aqueous solvent, simple experimental apparatus, low energy input and easily accessible precursors make the benzenetricarboxylate method attractive for low cost nanoparticle synthesis.

AB Single-phased Ca8ZnCe(PO4)(7):Eu2+,Mn2+ phosphors with whitlockite-type structure have been prepared via the combustion-assisted synthesis technique. The XRD pattern show that the as-obtained phosphors crystallize in a trigonal phase with space group of R-3c (161). Ca8ZnCe(PO4)(7) host is full of sensitizers (Ce3+) and the Ce3+ emission at different lattice sites has been discussed. The efficient energy transfers from Ce3+ ions to Eu2+/Mn2+ ions and from Eu2+ to Mn2+ have been validated. Under UV excitation, the emitting color of Ca8ZnCe(PO4)(7):Eu2+/Mn2+ samples can be modulated from violet blue to green and from violet blue to red-orange by the energy transfers of Ce3+ -> Eu2+ and Ce3+ -> Mn2+, respectively. Additionally, white emission has been obtained through adjusting the relative concentrations of Eu2+ and Mn2+ ions in the Ca8ZnCe(PO4)(7) host under UV excitation. These results indicate that as-prepared Ca8ZnCe(PO4)(7):Eu2+,Mn2+ may be a potential candidate as color-tunable white light-emitting phosphors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two polyethers containing electroactive pendent 4-(carbazol-2-yl)-7-arylbenzo[c]-1,2,5-thiadiazole moieties have been synthesized by the multi-step synthetic route. Full characterization of their structures is presented. The polymers represent derivatives of very high thermal stability with initial thermal degradation temperatures of 425 degrees C and 431 degrees C. Glass transition temperatures of the amorphous materials were also very high and reached values of 154 degrees C and 163 degrees C. The electron photoemission spectra of thin layers of the polymers showed ionization potentials of 5.84 eV and 5.93 eV. Hole-transporting properties of the polymeric materials were tested in the structures of organic light emitting diodes with Alq(3) as the green emitter and electron transporting material. An electroluminescent device containing hole-transporting layer (HTL) of the polymer with electroactive 4-carbazolyl-7-phenylbenzo[c]1,2,5-thiadiazole moieties exhibited turn on voltage of 6.2 V, maximum photometric efficiency of 2.5 cd/A and maximum brightness exceeding 300 cd/m(2). The device containing HTL of the polymer with 4carbazolyl-7-(1-naphtyl)benzo[c]-1,2,5-thiadiazole moieties demonstrated turn on voltage of 5.2 V, maximum photometric efficiency of 1.6 cd/A and maximum brightness exceeding 1500 cd/m2. The efficiencies were about 30-90% higher than that of the device containing widely used hole transporting layers of poly(9-vinylcarbazole). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The ultrafast nonlinear optical response of SnS2 layered compound, excited by high-repetition-rate ultrashort (fs) pulses at 1550 nm wavelength, is investigated for the first time by optical third harmonic generation. In this nonlinear process, only the ultrafast nonlinear optical effect of pure electronic origin is involved, in spite of the thermo-optic effect that arises due to the temperature rise induced in the sample by high-repetition-rate laser pulses. From the experimental dependence of the third harmonic intensity on fundamental harmonic intensity, the third-order nonlinear optical susceptibility and the corresponding nonlinear refractive index of SnS2 are determined.

AB A conjugated polyschiff base (poly(N-thieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl)methylene)-1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-amine) poly(TTMA)) was synthesized by condensation polymerization between thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2,5-dicarboxaldehyde and 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole. The poly(TTMA) was characterized by FT-IR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR spectra and thermal analysis. The number average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index of the poly(TTMA) were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). In addition, the optical properties of the poly(TTMA) solutions were investigated at different molarities. The band gap E-g value of the poly(TFMA) decreased with the increasing molarity. The absorption band edge values of the poly(TTMA) decreased as the molarity increased. The average transmittance values of the poly(TTMA) increased with the increasing molarity and the highest values of molar extinction coefficient also were found in the near ultraviolet region. Its values decreased with the increasing molarity. These results showed that the poly(TTMA) can be used for the fabrication of many optoelectronic devices due to its suitable optical properties and low optical band gap. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study zinc borate glasses doped with different concentrations Ta2O5 were synthesized and were crystallized by heat treatment for prolonged times. The samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, IR and Raman spectroscopy techniques. The SEM images of the crystallized samples have indicated that the samples contain randomly distributed crystal grains with size similar to 1 mu m entrenched in the residual amorphous phase. XRD studies have exhibited diffraction peaks identified as being due to the reflections from (1 1 1) planes of monoclinic Zn3Ta2O8 crystal phase that contains intertwined tetrahedral zinc and octahedral tantalate structural units. The concentration of such crystal phases in the bulk samples is observed to increase with increase of Ta2O5 up to 3.0 mol%. The IR and Raman spectroscopy studies have confirmed the presence of ZnO4 and TaO6 structural units in the glass network in addition to the conventional borate structural units. For measuring third harmonic generation (THG) in the samples, the samples were irradiated with 532 nm laser beam and the intensity of THG of probing beam (Nd:YAG) lambda = 1064 nm 20 ns pulsed laser (omega)) is measured as a function of fundamental beam power varying up to 200 J/m(2). The intensity of THG is found to be increasing with increase of fundamental beam power and found to be the maximal for the glass crystallized with 3.0 mol% of Ta2O5. The intensity of THG of the ceramicized samples is found to be nearly 5 times higher with respect to that of pre-crystallized samples. The generation of 3 omega is attributed to the perturbation/interaction between Zn3Ta2O8 anisotropic crystal grains and the incident probing beam. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We study the magnetic field induced optical transparency and its origin in magnetic nanoemulsion of droplets of average size similar to 200 nm containing superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. Beyond a certain volume fraction (Phi > 0.0021) of magnetic nanoemulsion and a critical magnetic field (H-c1), the transmitted light intensity increases drastically and reaches a maximum at another critical magnetic field (H-c2), beyond which the transmitted light intensity decreases and reaches a plateau. Interestingly, the transmitted light intensity at H-c2 is found to increase linearly with rh and the critical magnetic fields Ho and Ha follow power law decay with Phi (i.e. H-c similar to Phi(-X)), with exponents 0.48 and 0.27, respectively. The light intensity recovers to its initial value when the magnetic field is switched off, indicating the perfect reversibility of the field induced transparency process. The observed straight line scattered patterns above H-c2, on a screen placed perpendicular to the incident beam, confirms the formation of rod like anisotropic nanostructures perpendicular to the direction of light propagation. The magneto-optical measurements in the emulsion confirm that the observed field induced transparency in magnetic emulsions for Phi > 0.0021 is due to the optical birefringence caused by the rod like nanostructures. The reduced birefringence is found to be proportional to the square of the applied magnetic field. This finding offers several possibilities in using magnetic nanofluids in tunable optical devices.

AB Infrared spectroscopy allows for highly selective and highly sensitive detection of gas species and concentrations. Conventional gas spectrometers are generally large and unsuitable for on-chip applications. Long absorption path lengths are usually required and impose a challenge for miniaturization. In this work, a gas spectrometer is developed consisting of a microtube photonic crystal structure. This structure of millimetric form factors minimizes the required absorption path length due to slow light effects. The microtube photonic crystal allows for strong transmission in the mid-infrared and, due to its large void space fraction, a strong interaction between light and gas molecules. As a result, enhanced absorption of light increases the gas sensitivity of the device. Slow light enhanced gas absorption by a factor of 5.8 in is experimentally demonstrated at 5400 nm. We anticipate small form factor gas sensors on silicon to be a starting point for on-chip gas sensing architectures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1 at.% Nd: CaF2 nanoparticles doped with different concentrations of La3+ ions (from 0 to 5 at.%) were synthesized by co-precipitation method. Phase identification, morphology of the nanoparticles were investigated by XRD and SEM measurements. The Nd, La: CaF2 ceramics were fabricated by hot-pressed method in the vacuum environment. The transmittance of all the ceramics reached 88% at the wavelength of 1400 nm. The luminescence intensities and decay lifetimes enhanced significantly with the increasing of La3+ concentration. The Nd, La: CaF2 ceramics have broad and flat emission band at 1050 nm with the largest FWHM of 28.16 nm. In addition, the spectrum results indicated that the fluorescence lifetime of Nd, La: CaF2 ceramics was longer than that of the Nd, Y: CaF2 ceramics with the same doping concentration.

AB A near-infrared (nIR) light actuated tunable transmission optical grating based on graphene nanoplatelet (GNP)/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and PDMS is proposed. A simple fabrication protocol is studied that allows integration of the grating with the actuation mechanism; both components are made from soft elastomers, and this ensure the tunability and the light-driven operation of the grating. The resulting grating structure demonstrates continuous period tunability of 2.7% under an actuation power density of 220 mW cm(-2) within a period of 3 s and also demonstrates a time-independent characteristic. The proposed infrared activated grating can be developed for wireless remote light splitting in bio/chemical sensing and optical telecommunications applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The luminescence and scintillation characteristics of Czochralski-grown (GdxY3-xAl2Ga3O12:Ce (x = 1,2,3) single crystals are presented. With increasing Gd content in this garnet host, the 5d(2) absorption band was blue-shifted while the 5d(1) absorption and 5d(1) -> 4f emission bands were red-shifted due to an increase in the crystal field splitting of the 5d levels. In addition, the luminescence quenching temperature of the Ce3+ emission and activation energy for thermal quenching decreased with increasing Gd content. The Gd3+ -> Ce3+ energy transfer was evidenced by photoluminescence excitation spectra of Ce3+ emission. At 662 keV gamma - rays, the light yield (LY) of 48,600 ph/MeV and energy resolution of 6.5% was measured for a Gd3Al2Ga3O12:Ce crystal. Scintillation decay measurements were performed using the time-correlated single photon counting technique. Superior time resolution of Gd3Al2Ga3O12:Ce is due to its high LY and fast scintillation response. The total mass attenuation coefficients at 60 and 662 keV gamma - rays were also determined.

AB Borate glasses containing a large amount of Tb3+ ions have been prepared by containerless processing. The content of Tb2O3 reached 60 mol%. The glass bearing the highest content of Tb3+ ions showed a large Faraday effect; the Verdet constant was 234 rad/T m. Annealing of the glasses in H-2/N-2 atmosphere resulted in a low optical absorption coefficient, leading to an extremely large magneto-optical figure of merit that was similar to 1.7 times higher than that of Tb3Ga3O12 single crystal.

AB To investigate the cause of the thermal instability of Yb3+-ions doped Ba3Gd(BO3)(3) crystal grown from Czochralski technique, the low temperature phase beta-Ba3Gd(BO3)(3) powder was synthesized at the temperature of 800 degrees C. To inhibit the phase transition of high temperature phase Yb-alpha-Ba3Gd(BO3)(3) during the crystal growth process, co-doping ions Sr2+, Ca2+ and La3+ ions were introduced in Yb:alpha-Ba3Gd(BO3)(3) crystal. The melting point increased and the thermal stability of Yb:alpha-Ba3Gd(BO3)(3) crystal was improved by co-doping ions. The absorption peaks of co-doped crystals centered at 976 nm with FWHM of 11, 11 and 12 nm and the absorption cross sections were 3.40 x 10(-21) cm(2), 4.00 x 10(-21) cm(2) and 2.66 x 10(-21) cm(2), respectively. The emission cross sections at 1040 nm were 2.19 x 10(-21) cm(2), 2.53 x 10(-21) cm(2) and 1.93 x 10(-21) cm(2), respectively. The fluorescence times of co-doped by Sr2+, Ca2+ and La3+ ions were shorter than that of Yb:alpha-Ba3Gd(BO3)(3) crystal. So Yb:alpha-Ba3Gd(BO3)(3) crystals co-doped by Sr2+, Ca2+ and La3+ ions will be more suitable for LD-pumping laser. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of new fluorescent styryl dyes based on anchoring ester containing carbazole as donor appended to different acceptor groups to have a conjugated pi-system with push-pull geometry are studied. The NLO properties have been determined using solvatochromic and computational methods. Three different TD-DFT functional are used namely, B3LYP, BHandHLYP, and CAM-B3LYP, with aim of elucidating better functional for NLOphores. Further, the two photon properties (sigma(2pA)) have been described theoretically by two level model considering the dipole moment difference between the ground and the final electronic states and bypassing the intermediated resonance state. The compounds with a high charge transfer from the acceptor group to the carbazole ring have relatively high two-photon absorption cross-sections (60-317 GM). The linear polarizability (alpha(CT)), first order hyperpolarizability (beta) and second order hyperpolarizability (gamma) for 4c dye was the highest among the studied dyes which is attributed to the lesser energy gap evident by both the methods. But in contrary, the sigma(2pA) cross-section value was low for dye 4c which is due to the presence of freely rotatable twisted phenyl ring in the conjugation path, pulling the electron density towards itself and thus lead to decrease in sigma(2pA) cross-section. Structure-property relationship is better understood by the correlation of bond length alternation/bond order alternation (BLA/BOA) with NLO properties of dyes. Thus by simple solvatochromic method and computational method, we have screened the carbazole styryls as NLO candidates with good first order hyperpolarizability and good two photon cross-section.

The present work reports on a new concept for realizing such waveguides on a planar substrate by capillary filling microchannels (cladding) with monomer solution (core). A graded-index profile is obtained by intermixing between the core and cladding material at the microchannel interface. To this end, various ratios of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and octafluoropentyl methacrylate (OFPMA) were evaluated as starting monomers and the results showed that the polymers P50:50 (50:50 MMA:OFPMA) and P0:100 (100% OFPMA) were suitable to be applied as waveguide core and cladding material respectively. Light guiding in the resulting P50:50/P0:100 waveguides was demonstrated and the refractive-index profile was quantified and compared with that of conventional step-index waveguides. The results for both cases were clearly different and a gradual refractive index transition between the core and cladding was found for the newly developed waveguides. Although the concept has been demonstrated in a research environment, it also has potential for upscaling by employing drop-on-demand dispensing of polymer waveguide material in pre-patterned microchannels, for example in a roll-to-roll environment.

AB In this report, a series of 3-(4-(Dimethylamino) phenyl)-1-(4,3 di-substituted phenyl)-(2E) - propen -1-one chalcones was synthesised and examined as optical materials. The influence of functional groups (FG) and solvents on their photophysical properties was investigated. These include absorption, fluorescence, Stokes shift, and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). The absorption spectra of all compounds showed a wavelength band in the range 404-429 nm, whereas the fluorescence spectra exhibited a band at 470-535 nm. We found that the fluorescence intensity was inversely proportional to the concentration of chalcones. The FGs and solvents had an amazing effect on the photophysical properties of the synthesised materials. Unexpectedly, the electron withdrawing group showed a highly red shift, whereas the electron donating group exhibited a blue shift. Further, these compounds showed large Stokes shifts (up to 5800 cm(-1)). ASE was observed under pump pulse laser excitation, and the wavelengths were tuned from 509 to 566 nm.

AB Hybrid inorganic/organic one dimensional photonic crystal based on alternating layers of Si/HMDSO is elaborated. The inorganic silicon is deposited by radiofrequency magnetron sputtering and the organic HMDSO is deposited by PECVD technique. As the Si refractive index is n = 3.4, and the refractive index of HMDSO layer depend on the deposition conditions, to get a photonic crystal with high and low refractive index presenting a good contrast, we have varied the radiofrequency power of PECVD process to obtain HMDSO layer with low refractive index (n = 1.45). Photonic band gap of this hybrid structure is obtained from the transmission and reflection spectra and appears after 9 alternative layers of Si/HMDSO. The introduction of defects in our photonic crystal leads to the emergence of localized modes within the photonic band gap. Our results are interpreted by using a theoretical model based on transfer matrix. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The combination of Eu3+ and Dy3+ in co-doped glassy materials provides interesting applicability for white light emission devices. In this work, Dy:Eu doped Calcium Boroaluminate (CaBAl) glasses were prepared by conventional melting quenching, with 3 wt% of Dy2O3 and Eu2O3 content varying from 0 to 3 wt%, and results of absorption spectra, photoluminescence and photoluminescence lifetime are discussed in terms of Eu2O3 content. The photoluminescence of the samples was studied under excitation of 365 and 405 nm light source. The 365 nm excitation shows favor to the Dy3+ ion emission. The results of photoluminescence lifetime at 575 nm (Dy3+) shows a decrease due to Eu2O3 addition, which suggests an energy transfer from Dy3+ (donor) to the Eu3+ (acceptor). On the other hand, under excitation of 405 nm, the photoluminescence lifetime at 575 nm (Dy3+), shows no significant changes due to Eu2O3 amount, which indicates that the energy transfer from Dy3+ to Eu3+ (under lambda(exc) = 405 nm) is negligible. However, the results of photoluminescence under 405 nm excitation present a white yellowish emission in the CIE diagram, which shifts to red with Eu2O3 addition. The combination of a Blue LED (BL) emission with the emission of the samples was also studied in the CIE diagram, in order to improve light emission and to obtain ideal White Light (WL). The results show that by modifying the emission intensity of BL, it is possible to achieve a route for smart lighting, close to the circadian light cycle. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Present study performs an extensive exploration of the profiles of DC-Kerr effect (DCKE) of doped GaAs quantum dot (QD) under the control of Gaussian white noise. A large number of important physical parameters have been varied over a range and the resultant changes in the DCKE profiles have been thoroughly analyzed. The said physical parameters comprise of electric field, magnetic field, confinement potential, dopant location, dopant potential, noise strength, aluminium concentration (only for AlxGa1-xAs alloy QD), carrier density, relaxation time, position-dependent effective mass (PDEM), position-dependent dielectric screening function (PDDSF), anisotropy, hydrostatic pressure (HP) and temperature. The particular physical quantity being varied, presence of noise and its pathway of application, in combination, lead to emergence of diverse features in the DCKE profiles. As a technologically significant aspect we often find maximization of DCKE for some typical combinations as mentioned above. Presence of multiplicative noise, in general, causes greater shift and greater augmentation of DCKE profiles from a noise-free condition than its additive counterpart. The outcomes of the study indicate ample scope of tailoring DCKE of doped QD systems in presence of noise by minute adjustment of several control parameters. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Yttrium-alumina-borate glasses activated by the Yb3+ ions with compositions close to the huntite-like (Y(1-x)Ln(x))Al-3(BO3)(4) crystals have been synthesized by conventional melt-quenching technique in a platinum crucible, and their spectral-luminescent and laser properties have been investigated. It is established that this activator forms in the given glass one type of optical centers having the radiation decay time of 870 +/- 40 mu s. The limiting quantum yield of its luminescence in the case of complete dehydration of the glass will amount to approximate to 94%. The main laser parameters have been calculated and the nonlinearity of the refractive index and the threshold of laser-induced destruction of the glass surface have been determined. The lasing has been obtained on the glass plate of 2.1 mm thickness with a threshold of approximate to 60 W/mm(2) estimated by specific absorbed power. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A highly luminescent europium complex obtained with two different ligands, succinimide (SI) and 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA), was synthetized with different TTA concentrations. The photoluminescence (PL) emission from these materials corresponds to the characteristic inter-electronic energy level transitions of the Eu3+ ions. However, the excitation spectrum is strongly dependent on the presence of TTA, having an optimum response when 0.75 mmol of this compound is added to the EuL3(H2O)(3) complex. The quantum yield obtained by these powders were around 72%+/- 1.7% indicating an optimum sensitization of these complex. The EuL(3)TTA complex with the best PL properties was embedded in a styrene butadiene copolymer (SBC) film, produced by the drop casting method, obtaining similar PL behavior at different concentrations, the highest intensity was observed at 1.2% (w/v) of EuL(3)TTA complex and the quantum yield of these composite films was 60.5%+/- 2%. These films were exposed to continuous UV irradiation and after 141 h no photo-bleaching effect was observed in contrast with the EuL3TTA complex that exhibited a noticeable photoluminescence intensity degradation at much shorter exposure times. Both the Eu-complexes and the composite films were characterized by FT-IR, XRD, SEM and fluorescence spectroscopy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An inverse analysis of the phosphor layer of a commercially available, conformally coated, white LED is done based on tomographic and spectrometric measurements. The aim is to determine the radiative transfer coefficients of the phosphor layer from the measurements of the finished device, with minimal assumptions regarding the composition of the phosphor layer. These results can be used for subsequent opto-thermal modelling and optimization of the device. For this purpose, multiple integrating sphere and gonioradiometric measurements are done to obtain statistical bounds on spectral radiometric values and angular color distributions for ten LEDs belonging to the same color bin of the product series. Tomographic measurements of the LED package are used to generate a tetrahedral grid of the 3D LED geometry. A radiative transfer model using Monte Carlo Ray Tracing in the tetrahedral grid is developed. Using a two-wavelength model consisting of a blue emission wavelength and a yellow, Stokes-shifted re emission wavelength, the angular color distribution of the LED is simulated over wide ranges of the absorption and scattering coefficients of the phosphor layer, for the blue and yellow wavelengths. Using a two-step, iterative space search, combinations of the radiative transfer coefficients are obtained for which the simulations are consistent with the integrating sphere and gonioradiometric measurements. The results show an inverse relationship between the scattering and absorption coefficients of the phosphor layer for blue light. Scattering of yellow light acts as a distribution and loss mechanism for yellow light and affects the shape of the angular color distribution significantly, especially at larger viewing angles. The spread of feasible coefficients indicates that measured optical behavior of the LEDs may be reproduced using a range of combinations of radiative coefficients. Given that coefficients predicted by the Mie theory usually must be corrected in order to reproduce experimental results, these results indicate that a more complete model of radiative transfer in phosphor layers is required.

AB We propose a simple hollow-core circular lattice photonic crystal fiber (PCF) based surface plasmon resonance (SPR) refractive index sensor. The sensing performance is investigated by using the finite element method (FEM). Silver is used as the plasmonic material for this design, which is placed on the outer surface of the PCF to facilitate the fabrication. The proposed sensor shows a maximum wavelength sensitivity of 4200 nm/RIU with a sensor resolution of 2.38 x 10(-5) RIU. Besides, a maximum amplitude sensitivity of 300 RIU-1 and a resolution of 3.33 x 10(-5) RIU is reported for an analyte refractive index of 1.37. Moreover, the effect of varying structural parameters on the sensing performance such as pitch, air hole diameter and silver layer thickness are also discussed thoroughly. Sensitivity analysis of the proposed sensor is performed in order to investigate the impact on loss depth and amplitude sensitivity. Thanks to high sensitivity and linearity characteristics, the proposed sensor can be potentially employed in practical bio-sensing and chemical sensing applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Holographic polymer dispersed liquid crystals (HPDLCs) are the result of the optimization of the photopolymer fabrication techniques. They are made by recording in a photopolymerization induced phase separation process (PIPS) in which the liquid crystal molecules diffuse to dark zones in the diffraction grating originated. Thanks to the addition of liquid crystal molecules to the composition, this material has a dynamic behavior by reorientation of the liquid crystal molecules applying an electrical field. In this sense, it is possible to use this material to make dynamic devices. In this work, we study the behavior of this material working in low frequencies with different spatial periods of blazed gratings, a sharp profile whose recording is possible thanks to the addition of a Holoeye LCoS-Pluto spatial light modulator with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels (HD) and a pixel size of 8 x 8 mu m(2). This device allows us to have an accurate and dynamic control of the phase and amplitude of the recording beam. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we focused on the syntheses, structure and spectroscopic properties of GdVO4:Dy3+ and DyVO4 (nano)particles of different sizes and shapes (spherical nanoparticles of 2 nm, 4 nm, and 20 nm in size, nanorods with a few nanometers in diameter and up to 10-20 nm in length and microparticles of 1 -8 mu m) obtained by four synthetic methods. The size effect on the structure, Raman active modes, and photoluminescence emission intensities was analyzed by X-ray diffraction, Raman and photo-luminescence spectroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and diffuse reflection spectroscopy. All X-ray diffraction patterns clearly indicated presence of a single tetragonal zircon-type phase; absence of impurity phases indicate that the dopant Dy3+ ions were successfully and uniformly incorporated into the GdVO4 host lattice due to the equal valence and similar ionic radii. Micro-Raman measurements support the XRD measurements and showed Raman-active modes of the REVO4 systems (RE = Gd, Dy). The difference between the two hosts in the diffuse reflectance spectra was observed and it could be attributed to more effective Gd3+ ions on the charge transfer bands and different polarization (compared to bulk material) in smaller nanoparticles. Photoluminescence spectroscopy showed several bands in the visible and near-infrared regions which can be exclusively attributed to the f-f transitions of Dy3+ ions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB We report a two-step fabrication of zinc oxide-polyvinylpyrrolidone (ZnO-PVP) composites for potential phosphor-based applications. The composites are fabricated by initially preparing ZnO microrods using hydrothermal growth method and then dip-coating the microrods into aqueous PVP solutions with varying molar concentrations. The as-prepared ZnO microrods exhibit smooth surfaces and broad visible emissions, while the ZnO-PVP composites have pitted surfaces with shifted and reduced visible emissions. These changes in the structural and optical properties, which are found to depend on the PVP concentration, are attributed to the adsorption of PVP on the microrod surface. Although the surface morphology and visible emission are modified by PVP, the composites still maintain a hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure and near-band-edge ultraviolet (UV) emission similar with the as-prepared microrods. Our results therefore suggest that the ZnO-PVP composites can be used as phosphors that offer not only properties found in both ZnO and PVP but also tunable visible emissions which can be controlled during material fabrication.

AB In this paper, (Lu1-xGdx)(2)O-3:Eu (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) ceramics were consolidated by the solid-state reaction method combined with vacuum sintering without sintering aids. We investigated the effect of the varying contents of Gd2O3 on the structure and spectroscopic properties of (Lu1-xGdx)(2)O-3:Eu ceramics. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicate that proper amount of Gd2O3 can incorporate well with Lu2O3 and form Lu2O3-Gd2O3 solid solution. However, excessive Gd3+-doping in Lu2O3 will lead to the cubic phase transforming into monoclinic even hexagonal phase. The Gd3+ substitution no more than 50% of Lu2O3 enhances the radioluminescence, and reduces the fluorescence lifetime. Transmittance, photoluminescence, and radiation damage of the (Lu1-xGdx)(2)O-3:Eu scintillation ceramics were also studied. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A feasible method was used to synthesize YVO4:Eu nanocrystals in nanoporous high-silica glass (YVOE-HSG). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and photoluminescence spectroscopy were used to investigate its morphology, structure, and optical properties, respectively. The Eu ions were introduced as luminescence centers into the sample YVOE-HSG. Under 291 nm excitation, the samples exhibit the characteristic transitions of Eu3+ and Eu2+. With the increase of Eu3+ doping concentration, the positions of main excitation peaks shift to long waves. The reduction of Eu3+ to Eu2+ is observed, and the chromaticity coordinates (x, y) can move from the red light to cool white and then to blue light. The efficient energy transfer from VO43- to Eu3+ and Eu2+ is confirmed. Results indicated that the sample has potential application in white light-emitting diodes under UV excitation.

AB Freely dispersed carbon nanodots (CNDs) were introduced into a 3-glycidoxy-propyltrimethoxysilane modified silicate gel glass (i.e. an organically modified silica or ORMOSIL) by a highly efficient and simple sol-gel process, which could be easily extended to prepare functional molecules/nanoparticles solid state optoelectronic devices. Scanning electron microscope imaging, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, pore structure measurements, ultraviolet visible spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to investigate the surface characteristics, structure, texture, and linear optical properties of the CND/SiO2 ORMOSIL gel glasses. Images and UV/Vis spectra confirmed the successful dispersion of CNDs in the ORMOSIL gel glass. The surface characteristics and pore structure of the host SiO2 matrix were markedly changed through the introduction of the CNDs. The linear optical properties of the guest CNDs were also affected by the sol-gel procedure. The nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of the CNDs were investigated by a nanosecond open-aperture Z-scan technique at 532 nm both in liquid and solid matrices. We found that the NLO response of the CNDs was considerably improved after their incorporation into the ORMOSIL gel glasses. Possible enhancement mechanisms were also explored. The nonlinear extinction coefficient gradually increased while the optical limiting (OL) threshold decreased as the CND doping level was increased. This result suggests that the NLO and OL properties of the composite gel glasses can be optimized by tuning the concentration of CNDs in the gel glass matrix. Our findings show that CND/SiO2 ORMOSIL gel glasses are promising candidates for optical limiters to protect sensitive instruments and human eyes from damage caused by high power lasers.

AB Ground and excited states of four excitonic series (A, B, C and D) were discovered in HgGa2Se4 crystals at 10 K. Parameters of excitons and bands were determined. An effective mass of electrons me is equal to 0.26m(0) and masses of holes m(v1), m(v2) and m(v3) are equal to 2.48m(0), 2.68m(0) and 1.6m(0) respectively in point of Brilloin zone. Valence bands splitting by crystal field (Delta(cf) = 70 meV) and spin-orbital interaction (Delta(so) = 250 meV) were estimated in Brillouin zone center. Optical functions (n, epsilon(1) and epsilon(2)) for polarizations E perpendicular to c and E parallel to c in electron transitions region (2-6 eV) were calculated by Kramers-Kronig method. The discovered features were discussed on a base of the existing theoretical energetical band structure calculations and excitonic bands symmetries in k = 0 Brillouin zone for chalcopyrite crystals. The resonance Raman scattering was investigated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper demonstrates the behavior of defect reduction in un-doped GaN (u-GaN) grown on a commercial dome-shaped patterned-sapphire substrate (CDPSS). Residual strain inside the u-GaN grown on the CDPSS have been investigated as well. As verified by the experimentally measured data, the limited growth rate of the u-GaN on the sidewall of the CDPSS enhances the lateral growth of the GaN on the trench region while increasing the growth time. This subsequently contributes to improve the crystalline quality of the GaN on the CDPSS. The more prominent dislocations occur in the u-GaN epilayers on the CDPSS after reaching the summit of the accumulated strain inside the epilayers. Such prominent bent dislocations improve their blocking abilities, followed by the achievement of the better crystalline quality for the growth of the u-GaN on the CDPSS. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Red opaque glasses of two different sites in central Germany, a medieval glassworks in Glashutten, Taunus Mountains, and an early modern glassworks in Wieda, Harz Mountains, were analysed with regard to their optical appearance. By scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, metallic copper nanoparticles were identified as a conspicuous constituent in these glasses. In addition, similar opaque red glasses were reproduced in the laboratory in order to better understand the manufacturing process. Detailed analysis of the optical scattering was conducted in order to evaluate the role of Cu-0 nanoparticles in the colouring mechanism relative to other possible reasons of colouration.
   We find clear differences between the possible contributions of Cu2O (cuprite) particles and metallic copper (Cu-0) nanoparticles. Through simulated backscattering spectra we were able to calculate an average copper particle radius in the archaeological glass samples resulting in a value of up to 95 nm, which matches well the results of SEM investigation (minimum 65 nm). Using the methods we applied in this study, it becomes possible to reconstruct various processing conditions as they were applied in medieval manufacture of these particular materials.

AB Tunable terahertz (THz) reflection spectrum, ranged from 0.2 to 8 THz, in band gaps of gallium phosphide (GaP) materials excited by ultrasonic is investigated in the present paper, in which tunable ultrasonic and terahertz wave collinear transmission in the same direction is postulated. Numerical simulation results show that, under the acousto-optic interaction, band gaps of transverse optical phonon polariton dispersion curves are turned on, this leads to a dis-propagation of polariton in GaP bulk. On the other side, GaP material has less absorption to THz wave according to experimental studies, as indicates that THz wave could be reflected by the band gaps spontaneously. The band gaps width and acousto-optic coupling strength are proportional with ultrasonic frequency and its intensity in ultrasonic frequency range of 0-250 MHz, in which low-frequency branch of transverse optical phonon polariton dispersion curves demonstrate periodicity and folding as well as. With the increase of ultrasonic frequency, frequency of band gap is blue-shifted, and total reflectivity decreased with -1-order and -2-order reflectivity decrease. The band gaps converge to the restrahlen band infinitely with frequency of ultrasonic exceeding over 250 MHz, total reflectivity of which is attenuated. As is show above, reflection of THz wave can be accommodated by regulating the frequency and its intensity of ultrasonic frequency. Relevant technology may be available in tunable THz frequency selection and filtering. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB YVO4: Yb3+,Er3+ upconverting nanocrystals were synthesized via a hydrothermal method using different compounds as surfactants. Structure and morphology of the nanocrystals were investigated by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Tetragonal crystal structure of the nanocrystals appeared irrespective of the type of surfactant used. The average crystallite size was estimated by TEM images. The obtained products were composed of small nanoparticles, in the size range of 10-60 nm, depending on the surfactant used. The morphology of the nanoparticles was also regulated by the type of surfactant. Spectroscopic analysis of the materials obtained was carried out by measuring the emission and excitation spectra and the intensity of luminescence as a function of laser energy and luminescence decays. The nanocrystals prepared exhibited a green upconversion emission attributed to the H-2(11/2) -> I-4(15/2) and S-4(3/2) -> I-4(15/2) transitions of Er3+, under NIR (985 nm) pulse laser irradiation, and their emission lifetimes were in the range 3.84-4.90 mu s. On the basis of the spectroscopic investigation, the upconversion mechanism was proposed and chromaticity coordinates were calculated. Surfactants were found to influence on chromaticity of luminescence. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Cranioplasty is considered a low-risk operation in the field of neurosurgery following decompression craniectomy. Well-known complications after cranioplasty, such as infection, seizure, and titanium plate exposure, may not threaten the lives of patients. Unfortunately, there are many fatal complications that are underreported. In this study, we report a case and perform a literature review to introduce malignant cerebral swelling, which is regarded as a devastating complication.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 51-year-old man who was a victim of traumatic brain injury underwent emergency clot removal and decompression craniectomy. His neurologic condition improved with subsequent rehabilitation therapy, and he had left sinking skin flap syndrome where the skull was defective. Six months after the initial surgery, he underwent a cranioplasty; however, he did not recover from the uneventful anesthesia. A vacuum suction drain showed 300 mL of flow outflow had drained when his pupils dilated and fixed. An immediate computed tomography scan showed ipsilateral diffuse cerebral swelling with diffuse cerebral hemorrhage. Despite all approaches that were considered, the cerebral swelling continued to worsen until death.
   CONCLUSION: Cranioplasty is a high-risk procedure in some cases. Sinking skin flap syndrome and vacuum suction drain may be the main risks of a postoperative venous congestion and stasis, which may result in diffuse cerebral swelling. Once the computed tomography scan shows malignant cerebral swelling, the patient is expected to have a poor prognosis.

TI Rapid Progression of Ossification of the Posterior Longitudinal Ligament

ID POSTOPERATIVE PROGRESSION; FLOATING METHOD; LAMINOPLASTY; MYELOPATHY;
   DECOMPRESSION; SPINE; AREA
AB BACKGROUND: Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) has a reported incidence of 1.9%-4.3%. Disease progression is associated with surgery, with most studies focusing on OPLL progression after laminoplasty. The continued range of motion following surgery is believed to place strain on adjacent levels, driving calcification of the ligament. We present a case of marked progression of OPLL at levels adjacent to a previous anterior cervical discectomy and fusion.
   CASE REPORT: A 59-year-old man initially presented for progressive loss of balance and dexterity and underwent a C4-6 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion procedure. Computed tomography performed 1 year postoperatively showed fusion across C4-6 with no evidence of OPLL at any level. Two years following index surgery, the patient reported right-side arm pain. Computed tomography revealed new minimal OPLL opposite the C3-4 level that was not causing cord compression. A sparing midline bilateral C3-7 laminotomy was performed to correct stenosis seen on magnetic resonance imaging. At 7 years after the index procedure, the patient presented with myelopathic symptoms exceeding symptoms at his index presentation. Computed tomography revealed marked progression of OPLL. The patient underwent C2-T2 posterior fusion with laminectomy from C2-C7 and responded well with gradual improvements in balance and arm pain after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our report demonstrates that OPLL progression, which is largely reported following laminoplasty, may similarly occur following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion and supports the concept of motion-related OPLL progression.

AB BACKGROUND: Although the Woven EndoBridge (WEB [Sequent Medical, Aliso Viejo, California, USA]) is a highly innovative technique for the endovascular treatment of wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms (WNBAs), there are no studies available comparing this technique with surgical results or other endovascular results of stent-assisted coiling or balloon-assisted coiling for WNBAs. The purpose of this study was to assess complications, complete occlusion rate, and morbidity and mortality of the WEB in WNBA treatment.
   METHODS: Published literature citing embolization results for WNBAs using the WEB was reviewed. A systematic review was performed to evaluate the complications, complete occlusion rate, and morbidity and mortality.
   RESULTS: We identified 19 studies, including 935 patients. The most frequent aneurysm locations were the bifurcation of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) (42.8%), the anterior communicating artery (23%), and the basilar bifurcation (20.8%). The technical success rate of the WEB was 97% (95% confidence interval [CI], 96%-98%). The thromboembolic complication rate was 8% (95% CI, 6%-11%). The thromboembolic complication rate was 10% (95% CI, 7%-13%) in cases before 2013, which was higher than in cases after 2013 (6%; 95% CI, 4%-9%; P = 0.045). MCA bifurcation aneurysm has a higher thromboembolic complication rate than posterior circulation aneurysm. The overall bleeding complication rate of the WEB was 2% (95% CI, 1%-3%). The adequate occlusion rate was 81% (95% CI, 76%-85%). Morbidity during follow-up was 3% (95% CI, 1%-4%) (I-2 [30.4%), and mortality was 2% (95% CI, 1%-3%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Adequate aneurysm occlusion was found in 81% of WEB cases with low morbidity and mortality.

   Spinal cord injury; Subarachnoid-to-subarachnoid shunt
ID PAIN
AB BACKGROUND: Perhaps the most disabling condition seen in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) is spasticity. Spasticity is characterized as hyperreflexia and hypertonicity as a result of damage to the supraspinal tracts in the aftermath of SCI. Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) is the mainstay therapy for spasticity unresponsive to oral baclofen. One of the problems associated with post-SCI spasticity unresponsive to ITB is the development of scar tissue that prevents the diffusion of baclofen in the desired spinal cord area. This case offers a unique strategy to deal with multilevel scar tissue.
   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: This 46-year-old paraplegic male with a T8 SCI whose spasticity had been well managed with ITB therapy for many years recently suffered intractable spasticity necessitating multiple reoperations for a nonfunctioning ITB catheter secondary to extensive scar tissue and intrathecal adhesions. Placement of a subarachnoid-to-subarachnoid shunt eliminated the problem of extensive scar tissue preventing adequate baclofen therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: After undergoing multilevel thoracic and lumbar laminectomies with subarachnoid-to-subarachnoid spinal shunt, the patient's spasticity was finally brought under control with adequate daily baclofen infusion. This case demonstrates a creative way to address ITB catheter failure before considering other measures, such as neuroablative procedures (e.g., rhizotomy, myelotomy). This case reinforces the recommendation that ablative procedures, which have far greater complications, should be reserved for patients who have failed medical or other nonablative therapies.

ID OCCIPITAL ENCEPHALOCELE; RECONSTRUCTION; CEPHALOCELES; DEFECTS;
   MALFORMATIONS; EXCISION
AB BACKGROUND: Management of encephaloceles is challenging when massive brain herniation is present. In such instances, an expansile cranioplasty may be attempted so as to preserve some herniated brain tissue. Complications such as wound dehiscence, cerebrospinal fluid leak, and scalp necrosis are postoperative concerns. The treatment of scalp necrosis with dural and brain exposure is certainly a challenge due to the complexity of flap techniques in such a young age. Herein we describe the use of a novel technique for the management of a scalp necrosis and dehiscence in an infant.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A patient with a giant parietal encephalocele and massive brain herniation underwent an expansile cranioplasty. A large scalp necrosis ensued as a complication and later progressed to a suture dehiscence despite a new surgical intervention, with resultant brain exposure. A scalp reconstruction was subsequently performed using an artificial dermal substitute, laid directly onto the brain, followed by a split-thickness skin graft. We observed a rapid engraftment, without any further complications, with an acceptable cosmetic result in the long-term follow-up.
   CONCLUSION: A simple technique, such as the use of an artificial dermal matrix with simultaneous split-thickness skin graft, may be an effective treatment for the repair of scalp defects, even when coverage of exposed brain tissue is necessary, when no other techniques are found to be suitable.

AB BACKGROUND: Subdural hygroma is a rare disease most commonly encountered in posttraumatic patients. Even more rarely, it has been described as a complication of cerebellopontine angle tumor requiring surgical evacuation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This report discusses 2 patients who underwent surgery for cerebellopontine angle tumor and who both developed symptomatic subdural hygromas a few days later. Both became highly symptomatic but symptoms resolved spontaneously and promptly before planned surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: These 2 cases highlight the 2 principal pathogenesis theories for the development of subdural hygromas (arachnoid tear and effusion) and suggest a theory for their sudden and spontaneous resolution: the pressure equilibrium opening the valve created by the arachnoid tear. Eventhough surgical treatment remains the recommended attitude, these cases show that conservative treatment can be an option in some cases.

AB BACKGROUND: Pituitary ependymoma is exceptionally rare. Its etiology, clinical presentation, radiologic feature, and treatment strategy are still a matter of debate. Only 7 human cases with limited data were reported in the English literature, and now we described another case of pituitary ependymoma. We also systematically reviewed previously reported cases and described its potential etiology, clinical presentation, radiologic features, pathology, immunohistochemical analysis, and ultrastructural examinations.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A lesion in pituitary fossa was discovered in a 40-year-old man after suffering a progressive deterioration of vision in his right eye for >1 year with intermittent headache. The lesion was microsurgically resected and proved to be ependymoma upon pathologic and histologic examination. The patient made a fully recovery after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, only 7 patients with ependymoma in the sellar region have been described in the English literature. We reported 1 more case of pituitary ependymoma and discussed the potential etiology, clinical presentation, radiologic features, pathology, immunohistochemical analysis, ultrastructural examinations, treatment, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and prognosis of pituitary ependymoma. The case report may serve as a helpful reference for clinicians and radiologists.

AB Cavernous malformations (CMs) are uncommon lesions occurring in the central nervous system, with an incidence of approximately 0.5% in the general population and constituting 5%-10% of all intracranial vascular malformations. Among CMs, prevalence within the brainstem as reported in the literature has ranged from 4% to 35%. With their precarious location and potentially devastating clinical events, brainstem CMs have attracted attention from neurosurgeons, and with these surgeons' unrelenting efforts, the microsurgical techniques to treat these lesions in the brainstem have greatly improved in recent decades. Although surgical outcomes reported in the literature have been satisfying, surgical intervention has become increasingly contraindicated because of the tendency for a benign clinical course in brainstem CMs, after weighing this fact against the high risk of surgical morbidity. Thus, it is advisable to operate on patients with symptomatic lesions abutting the pial or ependymal surface of the brainstem or where lesions are accessible to safe entry zones, which have caused more than 1 significantly symptomatic hemorrhage and can be defined as aggressive. However, treatment remains controversial for deep-seated lesions away from the surface of the brainstem or lesions that are inaccessible to safe entry zones. Other treatments, such as radiosurgery and medication, are still debatable, which might be as an alternative for lesions amenable to but at high risk with surgery.

TI Case of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Caused by Tuberculous Aneurysm
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Aneurysm; Subarachnoid hemorrhage; Tuberculosis
ID MENINGITIS
AB BACKGROUND: Subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by rupture of tuberculosis associated aneurysm is a rare complication. In this paper, we report a case of intracranial tuberculum with adjacent intracerebral inflammatory aneurysm which caused subarachnoid hemorrhage and brain abscess formation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 28-year-old man presented with sudden onset of severe headache. He was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis 8 years ago, and had been treated with antituberculosis medications for 6 months. Head computed tomography showed a small hematoma in the left sylvian fissure with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral digital subtraction angiography was performed and no aneurysm was found. He was discharged after nonsurgical treatment. Three weeks later, he came back to our department with complaint of aphasia. Magnetic resonance images showed a cystic lesion with mass effect. During operation, we encounter the brain abscess and were surprised to find a middle cerebral artery aneurysm while dissecting. The abscess was totally removed, and the aneurysm was secured by clipping. The aneurysm was suspected of being inflammatory in nature and associated with the patient's tuberculosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis in the central nervous system may present as tuberculoma and tuberculous meningitis. Vasculitis secondary to tuberculous meningitis can cause infarcts, and, rarely, aneurysm formation. This case report illustrated a rare case of intracranial infectious aneurysm related to tuberculosis and complicated by hemorrhage and brain abscess.

AB BACKGROUND: A presacral Tarlov cyst is an unusual cause of abdominal pain. The unusual location of a presacral Tarlov cyst can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. To guide appropriate diagnosis and treatment, we reviewed causes, clinical presentations, radiologic features, and management options of this extremely rare lesion.
   METHODS: We performed an English-language literature search using PubMed to identify reports of patients with presacral Tarlov cysts. The diagnosis was based on classic radiologic signs. Seven patients described in 7 publications met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed in conjunction with 3 new patients described by our team.
   RESULTS: A congenital arachnoidal defect may be the primary causative factor of a presacral Tarlov cyst. Lumbosacral pain, leg pain, and bowel and bladder dysfunction are common clinical complaints, while abdominal pain is uncommon. Myelography and magnetic resonance imaging are considered useful diagnostic techniques. Myelography provided the definitive diagnosis for 33% of the patients, and magnetic resonance imaging was diagnostic for 67%. Surgical interventions may be appropriate for symptomatic presacral lesions. Two patients who received conservative treatment continued to experience their presenting symptoms, whereas 7 patients who underwent surgical treatment experienced favorable outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although extremely rare, presacral Tarlov cysts should be suspected in patients with abdominal pain, especially when pain occurs along with other neurologic symptoms. This review provides a systematic description of this rare disease, which may be helpful in guiding the appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

   CAVE; EXPOSURE
AB BACKGROUND: Surgical removal of giant vestibular schwannomas with severe petrous bone involvement remains challenging due to the high risk of complications. The retrosigmoid intradural suprameatal-inframeatal approach (RISIA) allows for safe exposure extending from Meckel's cave to the petrous internal carotid artery (ICA).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 27-year-old man presented with recurrence of a giant vestibular schwannoma (4.5 cm) invading Meckel's cave and the left petrous ICA. Symptoms included complete left facial palsy and hearing loss due to tumor invasion and previous operations, as well as left-sided trigeminal hypesthesia, abducens nerve palsy, and lower cranial nerve dysfunction due to tumor compression. The patient also exhibited severe discoordination and ataxia. The tumor was completely resected via the RISIA, which involved drilling of the suprameatal and inframeatal portions of the petrous bone. No approach-related complications were observed. Full recovery of cranial nerve functions (with the exception of those related to the facial and cochlear nerves) and balance were observed postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The RISIA allows for safe and effective surgical access during complete tumor resection, even when severe involvement of Meckel's cave and the petrous ICA are observed. The present report is the first to demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in patients with recurrent giant vestibular schwannoma.

ID SPHENOID SINUSITIS; CUSHINGS-DISEASE; DIAGNOSIS; SEIZURES; RISK
AB BACKGROUND: Cushing disease, induced by a pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting adenoma, is associated with high risk of stroke. At present, transsphenoidal surgery remains the first line of therapy. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is an uncommon form of stroke with variable presentations. There are no previous reports of its occurrence in patients with Cushing disease following transsphenoidal surgery.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a patient with Cushing disease who sustained CVST several days after a second transsphenoidal surgery. With adequate care and treatment, along with timely diagnosis, the patient made a near-complete recovery with only minor sequelae.
   CONCLUSIONS: In view of the poor outcome of untreated CVST, symptoms such as severe headache, nausea and vomiting, and cerebrospinal fluid leakage after transsphenoidal surgery could be of valuable assistance in early diagnosis, allowing immediate medical intervention with consequent improved prognosis.

   DISSOCIATION; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Atlanto-occipital rotatory dislocation (AORD) has rarely been reported in the literature; for this reason, the clinicoradiologic characteristics of this injury are not well described.
   METHODS: We describe the case of a 67-year-old man who sustained a cervical spine trauma. He reported only neck pain and was neurologically intact. A computed tomography scan showed a rotatory displacement of the atlanto-occipital joints associated with a widened condylar-C1 interval; in addition, magnetic resonance imaging showed injuries to the stabilizing ligaments of this area. A systematic literature review was also performed to identify previous cases of patients with AORD.
   RESULTS: The patient was treated with craniocervical fixation from occipital to C1, achieving a good outcome. The literature review yielded 9 cases of patients with AORD. Compared with patients with atlanto-occipital dislocation, patients with rotatory dislocations have a less severe degree of displacement of the atlanto-occipital joints and better clinical outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with previously classified atlanto-occipital dislocations, AORD is an independent and unique variation. AORD presents with different biomechanical, clinicoradiologic, and prognostic characteristics and represents an important addition to the spectrum of atlanto-occipital dislocation injuries.

LA English
DT Article
DE Atlantoaxial dislocation; Axis; C2-C3 dislocation; Posterior fusion
ID ATLANTOAXIAL DISLOCATION; CERVICAL-SPINE; FACETAL; C1-2
AB BACKGROUND: Congenital absence of C2 posterior arch may present with C2-C3 dislocation. Previously these cases were managed by fusing occiput-C1C4 without including C2 in the construct. Such constructs are likely to immobilize the long segment of the cervical spine, and exclusion of C2 may not yield the best result.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case with congenital absence of posterior arch of axis with C2-3 and C1-C2 dislocation who presented with progressive spastic quadriparesis. The inferior facets of C2 were rudimentary. In our patient the C1-C2-C3 dislocations were stabilized with C1 and C3 lateral mass along with C2 pedicle screws. Clinical improvement with radiologic realignment occurred.
   CONCLUSION: Absence of the posterior arch of axis may be associated with adjacent C1-C2 along with C2-C3 dislocation, so both levels need to be addressed. The radiology should be critically evaluated for other structures developing from the C2 neural arch.

TI Decompressive Craniectomy for Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage: A
   Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DE Complication; Decompressive craniectomy; Intracerebral hemorrhage;
   Meta-analysis; Spontaneous
ID TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; SURGICAL-TREATMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) is a devastating disease with high mortality and morbidity, and the application of decompressive craniectomy (DC) in sICH is controversial. We conducted a systematic review to verify the effects of DC on improving outcome in sICH.
   METHODS: Through searching several electronic databases, we screened eligible publications. Respective risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated, data were synthesized with a fixed-effect model, and sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were performed. Publication bias was measured with Begg and Egger tests.
   RESULTS: Overall effect showed that DC significantly reduced the poor outcome compared with the control group (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84-0.99; P = 0.03). But in the subgroup analyses, only studies published after 2010, studies using hematoma evacuation as control, and studies measuring outcome with Glasgow outcome score showed better outcomes in the DC group than in the control group. The other subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses achieved inconsistent results. Compared with the control group, DC effectively decreased mortality (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.53-0.85; P = 0.0008). The sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses achieved consistent results.
   CONCLUSIONS: The application of DC effectively reduced mortality in patients with sICH. DC might improve functional outcomes in certain populations and needs further verification. DC is not associated with increased incidences of postoperative rebleeding and hydrocephalus.

DT Article
DE Fusion; Sacral; Spondyloptosis
ID SPONDYLOLISTHESIS; SACRUM; SPINE
AB BACKGROUND: Spondyloptosis is grade V on the Meyerding classification. Traumatic spondyloptosis can occur throughout the spinal column, particularly at junctional levels, and finding an ideal surgical strategy to address it remains a challenge for spinal surgeons. The sacrum is considered a united bone in adults, and sacral intersegmental spondyloptosis is extremely rare.
   CASE REPORT: Herein, we present an unusual case of S2/S3 spondyloptosis in a 27-year-old female patient with spontaneous solid fusion.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates that similar distal sacral pathologies may be managed conservatively when there is no associated neurologic deficit, and the osteodiskoligamentous integrity of the lumbosacropelvic unit remains intact. Our report plus the very few published papers in the literature illustrate the natural history of uncomplicated traumatic spondyloptosis and support the role of in situ fusion and instrumentation as a reliable alternative to circumferential fusion in patients who cannot tolerate staged or prolonged operations.

AB BACKGROUND: Recently, neuromodulation through deep brain stimulation (DBS) has appeared as a new surgical procedure in the treatment of some types of dementia and epilepsy. The mammillothalamic and mammillotegmental tracts are involved among the new targets. To our knowledge, a review article focused specifically on these mammillary body efferents is lacking in the medical literature. Their contribution to memory is, regrettably, often overlooked.
   METHODS: A review of the relevant literature was conducted.
   RESULTS: There is evidence that mammillary bodies can contribute to memory independently from hippocampal formation, but the mechanism is not yet known. Recent studies in animals have provided evidence for the specific roles of these mammillary body efferents in regulating memory independently. In animal studies, it has been shown that the disruption of the mammillothalamic tract inhibits seizures and that electrical stimulation of the mammillary body or mammillothalamic tract raises the seizure threshold. In humans, DBS targeting the mammillary body through the mammillothalamic tract or the stimulation of the anterior thalamic nucleus, especially in the areas closely related to the mammillothalamic tract, has been found effective in patients with medically refractory epilepsy. Nonetheless, little knowledge exists on the functional anatomy of the mammillary body efferents, and their role in the exact mechanism of epileptogenic activity and in the memory function of the human brain.
   CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive knowledge of the white matter anatomy of the mammillothalamic and mammillotegmental tracts is crucial since they have emerged as new DBS targets in the treatment of various disorders including dementia and epilepsy.

ID ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE; INTRAVENOUS
   THROMBOLYSIS; ENDARTERECTOMY; RISK; THROMBECTOMY
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS) is known to be a rare but devastating complication of carotid artery revascularization. Because patients with acute ischemic stroke due to acute major cerebral and/or cervical artery occlusion treated with endovascular reperfusion therapy may have impaired autoregulation in the cerebral vasculature, these patients may also develop CHS. Despite the growing number of endovascular reperfusion procedures for acute ischemic stroke, this complication has only rarely been reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 77-year-old man developed acute cerebral infarction as the result of occlusions of the right internal carotid artery and right middle cerebral artery. After systemic intravenous injection of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, endovascular reperfusion therapy was initiated. The occluded arteries were successfully recanalized with thrombectomy by using a stent retriever for the middle cerebral artery and stent placement for the origin of the internal carotid artery. However, head computed tomography obtained 12 hours after treatment showed acute intracranial hemorrhage that did not involve the ischemic lesions. Under evaluation with transcranial near-infrared spectroscopy and single-photon emission computed tomography, the hemorrhage was considered to have been caused by CHS after reperfusion therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: CHS may lead to unfavorable outcomes after reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke. Recognizing clinical deterioration caused by CHS can be challenging in patients with neurologic disorders of acute ischemic stroke. Therefore, it is important to perform routine monitoring of regional cerebral oxygen saturation by using near-infrared spectroscopy, perform single-photon emission computed tomography promptly to evaluate cerebral blood flow, and maintain strict antihypertensive therapy to prevent CHS after reperfusion therapy.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Brown-Sequard injury; Nerve transfer; Surgical outcomes
ID UPPER-LIMB
AB BACKGROUND: Use of distal nerve transfer for improving upper limb function has been well described for patients with tetraplegic spinal cord injury and brachial plexus injuries but has not previously been described for Brown-Sequard type spinal cord injury. We describe our experience with 2 cases of combined Brown-Sequard injury and unilateral brachial amyotrophy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Patient 1, a 43-year-old woman, was involved in a motor vehicle accident and sustained left-side C5-7 level hemicord injury causing ipsilateral proximal arm weakness and sensory loss with contralateral hemi-sensory changes, neuropathic pain, and spasms. At 6 months after injury, she underwent a spinal accessory to suprascapular nerve, radial nerve triceps branch to axillary nerve, and ulnar fascicle to biceps transfer. At 2-year followup, she had improved function with Medical Research Council grade 4 power of shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, and internal and external rotation. Patient 2, a 38-year-old man, sustained a C4-5 fracture-dislocation in a motor vehicle accident and associated right-side hemicord injury involving the C5 and C6 myotomes with relatively preserved distal function. At 9 months after injury, he underwent radial nerve triceps branch to axillary nerve division and ulnar nerve fascicle to musculocutaneous nerve brachialis branch transfer. At 8 months after surgery, electromyography demonstrated evidence of further reinnervation of the deltoid muscle.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our early experience of nerve transfer with 2 patients with combined Brown-Sequard cord injury and brachial amyotrophy indicated acceptable surgical safety and demonstrated encouraging results.

AB BACKGROUND: PulseRider (Pulsar Vascular, Los Gatos, California, USA) is a new endovascular device designed to treat wide-neck bifurcation intracranial aneurysms. Deployment of a stent through a PulseRider to treat an aneurysm's recurrence has never been described before.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 55-year-old man who underwent coiling of an 8-mm anterior communicating artery aneurysm with assistance of a PulseRider neck reconstruction device. The 6-month digital subtraction angiography control showed aneurysm recurrence, so we deployed an Enterprise 2 closed-cell stent (Codman, Miami Lakes, Florida, USA) in the A1-A2 segment passing across the previously implanted PulseRider. Enterprise correctly expanded and allowed for adequate coiling of the aneurysm.
   CONCLUSION: An Enterprise stent can be safely opened through a PulseRider in order to treat aneurysm recurrence.

DT Review
DE Embryological lipoma classification; Failed primary neurulation;
   Intradural-extramedullary cervical lipoma
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal lipomas are generally thought to occur as a result of failed primary neurulation. Failed primary neurulation allows invasion of mesenchymal tissue of mesodermic origin into the neural structure, leading to the formation of a spinal lipoma. Despite most spinal lipomas being regarded as the result of failed primary neurulation, some confusion in terms of the embryogenesis of spinal lipomas remains. Recently, a novel classification of spinal lipomas based on embryonic changes seen during primary and secondary neurulation was has been proposed.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of an intradural-extramedullary spinal cord lipoma, associated with a subjacent subcutaneous lipoma at the cervicothoracic region. The patient presented with worsening neurologic symptoms, indicating ongoing cervical myelopathy. A subtotal resection along with posterior cervical stabilization was achieved, with mild improvement of neurologic symptoms. Clinical, pathologic, and radiologic records are reviewed.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first described case of a spinal cord lipoma with at such a location, one that cannot be fully categorized within the newly proposed classification system.

   RECANALIZATION; DEVICE; TRIAL
AB OBJECTIVE: In acute ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion, the interaction between the clot retriever and the stent is critical for achieving successful recanalization. The ideal time of stent deployment (dwell time [DT]) to improve revascularization is currently unknown. We systematically analyzed the effect of different DT on final angiographic and clinical outcomes of patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy.
   METHODS: The DT was progressively increased from 3 minutes to 5 minutes and then 8 minutes during the study period. The effect of DT on recanalization attempts, successful angiographic outcome (thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia [TICI] 2b or TICI 3), total revascularization time, and immediate and 3-month clinical outcomes were evaluated. The DT of 3 minutes and 5 minutes (DT3-5) was compared against DT of 8 minutes (DT8).
   RESULTS: Forty patients were included in the analysis. Good angiographic outcome was observed in 94.1% of patients in the DT8 cohort with an average attempt of 1.2 compared with 78.3% with average attempts of 2.0 in other group. Single-pass good recanalization (TICI 2b or 3) and single-pass complete revascularization (TICI3) was significantly higher in the DT group compared with the DT3-5 group (82.4% vs. 43.5% [P = 0.013] and 42.9% vs. 8.7% [P = 0.003], respectively). A favorable trend toward a reduced overall procedural time (34.59 vs. 55.59 minutes) was observed, but was not statistically significant (P = 0.15).
   CONCLUSIONS: Mild prolongation of DT to 8 minutes improves revascularization outcome with fewer attempts, possibly because of better clot-stent interaction.

AB BACKGROUND: Glioblastomas in the sellar region are very rare; in most cases, the tumor originates from the optic nerve or optic chiasm. Only 4 cases of sellar glioblastoma with a nonoptic origin have been reported. We present such a case with detailed clinical, imaging, and histopathologic information. We also review similar published cases.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 42-year-old woman presented with endocrinologic abnormalities, including amenorrhea and lactation, symptoms of diabetes insipidus, and signs of elevated intracranial pressure. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a giant, heterogeneously enhancing lesion involving the intrasellar, parasellar, and suprasellar regions, with hypercellularity and signs of infiltration of adjacent structures. Intraoperative examination revealed the tumor to be independent from the optic pathways, but it showed infiltration of the hypothalamic region. Histopathologic examination demonstrated uniformly packed small cells and negative staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein, which was consistent with a diagnosis of small cell glioblastoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a small cell glioblastoma in the sella turcica region. Glioblastomas in the sellar region with no clear evidence of an optic origin should be viewed as an independent disease entity. The typical characteristics of this tumor indicate it should be considered a rare subtype of glioblastoma. Further accumulation of experience is needed to better differentiate these cases and to offer optimal treatment.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify symptomatic vasospasms as a rare complication after transsphenoidal surgery, with emphasis on management and outcomes.
   METHODS: In this retrospective study, the medical records of 1997 patients who underwent microscopic transsphenoidal surgery at our hospital between 2008 and 2016 were analyzed regarding postoperative vasospasm events, clinical management, and neurologic outcomes.
   RESULTS: Four patients (0.2%) were identified who developed neurologic deficits in the postoperative phase caused by proven vasospasms due to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). All 4 patients were treated according to current state-of-the-art recommendations for SAH-triggered vasospasms and, as ultima ratio, intra-arterial spasmolysis. Nonetheless, all patients developed multilocular ischemic infarctions. Three patients recovered with no or only slight neurologic deficits (2 with a Glasgow Outcome Score [GOS] of 5; 1 with a GOS of 4), and 1 patient died, at 24 days after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although a rare complication, vasospasms after transsphenoidal surgery can lead to severe and multilocular ischemic infarctions with a wide variety of neurologic impairments. This rare complication should be considered in patients with unexpected postoperative neurologic deficits. Computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging and (contrast-enhanced) CT/magnetic resonance angiography are appropriate diagnostic tools. Treatment of vasospasms, including the option of intra-arterial spasmolysis, should not be delayed.

ID ANTERIOR CHOROIDAL ARTERY; MICROSURGICAL ANATOMY; TERRITORY; INFARCTION;
   STROKE
AB BACKGROUND: Entrapment of the temporal horn, known as isolated lateral ventricle (ILV), is a rare type of noncommunicating focal hydrocephalus, and standard treatment has not been established. We report 2 cases of endoscopic surgery for ILV and highlight the anatomic surgical nuances to avoid associated surgical risks.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The first patient presented with recurrent ILV following initial shunt placement for ILV, owing to shunt malfunction. In the second patient, ILV recurred secondary to choroid plexus inflammation caused by cryptococcal infection. Endoscopic temporal ventriculocisternostomy was effective in both cases. However, in the second case, the choroidal fissure was fenestrated, which led to cerebral infarction in the territory of the choroidal artery zone, attributed to damage of the branches of the choroidal segment of the anterior choroidal artery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although endoscopic temporal ventriculocisternostomy is considered a safe and less invasive procedure for treatment of symptomatic ILV, the technique is still associated with risks. To avoid complications, it is necessary to be familiar with the anatomy of the choroidal arteries and the pertinent endoscopic intraventricular orientation. Additionally, sufficient experience is required before it can be recommended as the treatment of choice.

AB BACKGROUND: Pediatric nonmissile penetrating head injury (NMPHI) is usually accidental attributed mainly to the softer skulls of growing children. However, it is a rare entity, and therefore no consensus exists regarding treatment to effectively prevent immediate and long-term complications. Throughout the literature, these injuries are mostly discussed in case reviews and case series in the general population. No data originating from randomized studies are available because of ethical and practical limitations.
   METHODS: We retrospectively studied and present 5 cases of children with NMPHI treated in the last 6 years in the Neurosurgery Department of Children's Hospital "Aghia Sofia". We performed a review of the literature in PubMed, using the key words "non-missile," "penetrating head injury," and "pediatric." We included case reports and case series involving pediatric cases since 2008 and selected older reports as well as certain literature reviews focusing on analysis of complications and treatment suggestions. We compared reported practice in various institutions with suggestions from the literature.
   RESULTS: In the last year, 4 literature reviews were published suggesting treatment algorithms of NMPHIs. Surgery timing and method as well as anticonvulsant and antibiotic therapy still remain debatable. The only review concentrating on pediatric populations dates back to 1994, based on patient outcome studies from the 1980s. In our review, treatment steps were similar among various institutions and resembled recently suggested algorithms, with better treatment outcomes than originally reported 30 years ago.

AB BACKGROUND: Hematoma evacuation is regular treatment for acute traumatic epidural hematoma (ATEDH) patients meeting with surgery indications. However, it is an invasive approach performed under general anesthesia. Here, a novel minimally invasive method of endovascular embolization with subsequent drainage surgery and use of urokinase was established to treat ATEDH under local anesthesia.
   METHODS: A novel minimally invasive method of endovascular embolization with subsequent drainage surgery and use of urokinase was established to treat ATEDH under local anesthesia. Firstly, 23 ATEDH patients with hematomas in the temporal area underwent digital subtraction angiography detecting the bleeding point. Next, embolization was performed. After embolization, drainage surgery was taken and urokinase was injected into the hematoma cyst by drainage tube to lyse hematoma twice per day.
   RESULTS: The results showed that the middle meningeal artery was the bleeding source. Embolization immediately ceased bleeding. Most clots were resolved and drained after treatment. No recurrence of hematoma or infection was observed.
   CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the combined treatments can be an alternative minimally invasive option for ATEDHs, especially for elderly patients or those contraindicated for general anesthesia.

ID EVOKED-POTENTIALS; OPTIC-NERVE
AB BACKGROUND: Diverse methods have been developed for intraoperative monitoring of the integrity of the visual pathways. We performed a review of the literature to determine the methodology of each technique as well as their recent development. The predictive power of each eligible technique was determined based on a meta-analysis.
   METHODS: A literature review was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Techniques adopted for intraoperative monitoring of the integrity of the visual pathways were extracted and described. The power of each eligible technique to predict the visual outcome was tested.
   RESULTS: Visual evoked potentials showed marked methodologic improvement in recent studies. Predictive power for visual deterioration after surgery was approximately 60% and reached 100% when coupled with simultaneous monitoring of electroretinography. The sensitivity of visual evoked potentials for detection of deterioration was 47.2%. The decrease of fractional anisotropy of the optic chiasma showed significant correlation with improvement of vision after chiasma compression and showed 100% predictive power for improvement.
   CONCLUSION: Each technique had limitations. Visual evoked potentials had a high predictive power for detection of deterioration but with low sensitivity. Fractional anisotropy of the optic chiasma had high predictive power for improvement of vision with low predictive power for deterioration.

AB INTRODUCTION: In sub-Saharan Africa, the management of ruptured intracranial aneurysms (RIAs) is difficult for many reasons. In this retrospective, 3-year study, the authors will demonstrate the particularities of the management of RIAs in Senegal.
   METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively 102 consecutive cases of RIAs operated on between May 2013 and December 2016 in Neurosurgical Department of Fann Hospital in Dakar, Senegal. Patients characteristics, imaging results, aneurysms, treatment, and outcome were analyzed.
   RESULTS: One hundred two cases were operated in this 3-year period of a total of 129 cases of RIAs received in our department in the same period. A total of 65% of the patients were female. According to the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) scale, 49% were WFNS I, and 33% WFNS III. Fisher scale showed 29% of Fisher 2 and 45% of Fisher 4. The aneurysms were located on anterior communicating complex in 38%, on the internal carotid artery in 28%, on the middle cerebral artery in 27% of cases and on posterior circulation in 9 cases. The pterional approach was used in 93 cases. According to the modified Rankin Scale, 67 patients (65.6%) had good outcome, 22 (21.5%) had poor outcome, and the mortality rate was 12.7% (13 patients) at last follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates encouraging results if one refers to the global patient postoperative outcomes. However, the large number of patients not undergoing treatment also requires us to improve preoperative management conditions.

   DESTRUCTION
AB BACKGROUND: Aortic pseudoaneurysms are a rare cause of chronic back pain, usually resulting from compression of the adjacent neurovasculature. It is uncommon for patients with pseudoaneurysms of the abdominal aorta to present in a delayed fashion after initial traumatic injury.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe an unusual case of delayed pseudoaneurysm formation with subsequent erosion into the adjacent L1 vertebral body. This pseudoaneurysm was secondary to a gunshot wound with retained ballistic fragment that had occurred 27 years previously. Herein, we discuss the patient's presenting symptoms, imaging, and overall treatment. In this particular case, we used a combined surgical and endovascular (hybrid) approach after the patient experienced recurrent low back pain, weeks after a primary endovascular treatment was performed. We additionally review the current literature on the management of aortic pseudoaneurysms causing vertebral body erosion and back pain.
   CONCLUSIONS: In our patient, a combined surgical and endovascular (hybrid) approach led to the complete resolution of his back pain symptoms and to complete exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm on follow-up imaging. Endovascular management of aortic pseudoaneurysms may be a reasonable alternative to open surgery in high-risk patients; however, this approach may result in a higher recurrence of pseudoaneurysm and initial presenting symptoms. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the efficacy of endovascular treatment of these lesions.

TI Hypoglossal Schwannoma of Neck: Case Report and Review of Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Hypoglossal nerve; Paraganglioma; Schwannoma
ID SUBMANDIBULAR SPACE; NERVE; NEURINOMA; TONGUE
AB BACKGROUND: Schwannomas are benign, slow-growing neoplasms of the myelin-producing Schwann cells of peripheral nervous system that most commonly affect sensory nerves. Hypoglossal schwannomas, tumors of purely motor nerves, comprise <5% of all head and neck schwannomas. Since the first description of a hypoglossal schwannoma in 1933, there have been few case reports of extracranial origins. The most common location of an extracranial hypoglossal schwannoma is in the parapharyngeal space and can mimic paragangliomas. We describe the case of a woman presenting with an enlarging neck mass originally thought to be a paraganglioma but ultimately discovered to be a hypoglossal schwannoma at surgery.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 63-year-old woman had a well-circumscribed, mobile, nontender, 3-cm firm mass at the mandibular angle. On computed tomography, the mass was at the level of the carotid bifurcation, splaying the branching vessels. It was further evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed a homogeneous, T2-hyperintense, T1-isointense mass with homogeneous contrast enhancement and scant flow voids. Biopsy revealed a spindle cell mass with positive S-100 staining. She underwent resection with the mass originating from the hypoglossal nerve.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hypoglossal schwannomas are rare lesions with a variable location along the course of the nerve. An extracranial lesion was described here, which was initially mistaken for a paraganglioma. Surgical resection is the consensus recommendation and is often well tolerated with low risk of long-term recurrence.

TI A Novel Skin and Fascia Opening for Subfascial Inserting of Intrathecal

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to introduce a new skin and fascia opening for intrathecal baclofen pump implantation in the abdomen, with the purpose of reducing complications related to wound breakdown.
   METHODS: We introduce a novel way of cutaneous and fascial opening that leads two opposed "L shaped" incisions.
   RESULTS: This method entails numerous advantages. The first advantage is avoiding the direct alignment of overlapped sutures, which creates a locus minoris resistentiae that can weaken and break under the push of the pump. Another advantage consists of an increased obstruction against deep extension of infective processes from cutaneous origin. The wide opening of the subfascial pocket permits the implantation of any type of pump available, and it reduces complexities in reopening the pouch for pump replacement. It also permits the fastening of all anchoring systems usually present in pumps. Another advantage is the improved possibility of careful muscle cauterization thanks to the wide fascia opening, with reduced risk of postsurgical hematoma. Our results showed a reduction of wound complications with this method.
   CONCLUSIONS: This method could contribute to reducing the rate of wound complications and patient discomfort.

AB BACKGROUND: Reconstruction of the skull base after resection of skull base meningiomas is of paramount importance. Here we describe a safe and effective method of skull base reconstruction using autologous free fat grafts.
   METHODS: In this retrospective analysis of patients operated for skull base meningioma from 2007 to 2014. We analyzed the surgical technique, efficiency and safety as well as the graft-related complications.
   RESULTS: Autologous free fat grafts were used in 55 patients, including 39 patients with posterior fossa meningiomas related to the petrous bone and 16 patients with anterior fossa meningiomas related to the paranasal sinuses. Three patients experienced postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak and were managed with temporary continuous lumbar drainage. One patient developed pneumocephalus and required revision. The occurrence of CSF leak was related to aggressive resection with resulting large skull base defects, especially in anterior skull base meningiomas. There were no donor site-related complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of autologous free fat grafts is an effective and safe technique for reconstructing skull base defects after microsurgical resection of skull base meningiomas.

   fractures
ID MANAGEMENT; ELEVATION; NEWBORN; INFANT; NEONATE; TRAUMA
AB BACKGROUND: Spontaneous intrauterine depressed skull fractures (IDSFs) are rare fractures that often require neurosurgical evaluation and therapy. Most of the reported congenital depressions are secondary to maternal abdominal trauma or instrumentation during delivery. Spontaneous IDSFs occur in the setting of uneventful normal spontaneous vaginal delivery or cesarean section, without obvious predisposing risk factors. The etiology and optimal management of spontaneous IDSFs remain controversial.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe 2 cases of spontaneous IDSF who underwent cranioplasty at our institution using an absorbable mesh, as well as review the current state of knowledge regarding the diagnosis and management of spontaneous IDSF. The 2 neonates, 1 male and 1 female, presented at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital with spontaneous IDSF after uneventful normal spontaneous vaginal deliveries. The fractures were located in the left frontal and right parietotemporal calvarium, respectively. Both patients underwent open craniotomy and elevation of their IDSFs with mesh cranioplasty. At last followup, both patients were normocephalic and neurologically intact.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgery consultation is necessary for initial evaluation of spontaneous IDSF. Surgical intervention is indicated for larger defects and/or intracranial involvement. Expectant management and negative-pressure elevation have also been shown to be effective.

TI Endovascular Mechanical Thrombectomy in Large-Vessel Occlusion Ischemic
   Stroke Presenting with Low National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale:
   Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator; Large vessel occlusion;
   Mechanical thrombectomy; Stroke
ID MILD; SYMPTOMS; OUTCOMES
AB INTRODUCTION: Mechanical thrombectomy has become the standard of care for management of most large vessel occlusion (LVO) strokes. When patients with LVO present with minor stroke symptomatology, no consensus on the role of mechanical thrombectomy exists.
   METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to identify studies that focused on mechanical thrombectomy, either as a standalone treatment or with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA), in patients with mild strokes with LVO, defined as a baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score <= 5 at presentation. Data on methodology, quality criteria, and outcome measures were extracted, and outcomes were compared using odds ratio as a summary statistic.
   RESULTS: Five studies met the selection criteria and were included. When compared with medical therapy without IV tPA, mechanical thrombectomy and medical therapy with IV tPA were associated with improved 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Among medical patients who were not eligible for IV tPA, those who underwent mechanical thrombectomy were more likely to experience good 90-day mRS than those who were not. There was no significant difference in functional outcome between mechanical thrombectomy and medical therapy with IV tPA, and no treatment subgroup was associated with intracranial hemorrhage or death.
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mild strokes due to LVO, mechanical thrombectomy and medical therapy with IV tPA led to better 90-day functional outcome. Mechanical thrombectomy plays an important role in the management of these patients, particularly in those not eligible for IV tPA.

AB OBJECTIVE: During the past few decades, Chinese endoscopic neurosurgery has rapidly developed in synchrony with the rest of the world. The aim of this article is to review the development of Chinese endoscopic neurosurgery, including its birth, growth, current situation, and prospects.
   METHODS: The history of Chinese endoscopic neurosurgery development can be divided into 3 stages: cognition and initial stage (1964-1995), exploration and maturity stage (1995-2006), and rapid development and promotion stage (2006-present).
   RESULTS: In the first stage, we mainly began to become aware of endoscopic neurosurgery from the translation and review of literature. In the mid to late 1990s, Chinese neurosurgery pioneers began using neuroendoscopic techniques. In the following decade, many leading neurosurgeons made persistent efforts to push the development of Chinese endoscopic neurosurgery forward, focusing on advocating for and promoting and popularizing neuroendoscopic technology. In the rapid development and promotion stage, many representative national and regional neurosurgical centers became skilled and efficient in the application of neuroendoscopic technology and became new advocates of the technology. The number of cases, level of technology, and treatment effectiveness are gradually nearing international standards. However, future development requires promotion of balanced development to decrease regional disparities, further strengthen international exchanges, follow the latest developments, and constantly innovate for continuous improvement.
   CONCLUSIONS: Following the dramatic efforts of several pioneers, development of Chinese endoscopic neurosurgery has been considerable, and it has become an important component of neurosurgery worldwide.

AB INTRODUCTION: Pilocytic astrocytoma is a classically benign tumor that most often affects pediatric patients. Rarely, it occurs during adulthood. We present a case series and systematic literature review of adult pilocytic astrocytoma (APA) to examine the clinical presentation, extent of resection, and recurrence rate associated with this tumor in this population.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our institutional records were retrospectively reviewed for cases of pilocytic astrocytoma in adults. A PubMed search identified English-language studies of pathology-proven APA. A meta-analysis was performed to determine the relationship between extent of tumor resection and recurrence.
   RESULTS: Forty-six patients with APA were diagnosed at our institution (mean age 33.6 +/- 13.3; 24 [52%] female). Twenty-four patients (52%) underwent gross total resection, 11 (24%) subtotal resection, 4 (9%) near total resection, 4 (9%) observation after biopsy, and 3 (6%) radiotherapy alone. Tumors recurred or progressed in 6 (13%) patients, of whom 4 were treated by STR and 2 were treated by radiotherapy alone. Thirty-nine (95%) patients were still alive at last follow-up. A systematic literature review identified 415 patients with APA in 38 studies. Including our case series, 7 studies reported extent of resection, followup, and recurrence. Of 254 patients with a weighted mean follow-up of 77.7 +/- 49.6 (31-250) months, 129 (51%) were treated with gross total resection, and 125 (49%) underwent subtotal resection. Tumor recurred in 79 (31%) patients, 22 (27%) after gross total resection and 57 (73%) after subtotal resection (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Pilocytic astrocytoma rarely presents during adulthood. Overall, prognosis is favorable and survival rates are high. APA recurrence is more likely after STR, and the goal of surgery should always be GTR when feasible.

   PATHOGENESIS
AB BACKGROUND: Ligamentum flavum cysts are thought to develop due to facet joint hypermobility; however, the etiology of these lesions is not completely elucidated. These cysts may lead to compressive pathologies of the spine requiring surgical intervention.
   CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 63-year-old male with chronic back pain and progressive neurogenic claudication for 6 months. He was found to have a ligamentum flavum cyst situated along the dorsal midline of the lumbar spinal canal contributing to spinal stenosis. The patient underwent a decompressive L4 laminectomy and en bloc excision of the ligamentum flavum cyst with complete resolution of his symptoms postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that chronic mechanical stress leads to degeneration of the ligamentum flavum and contributes directly to cyst formation.

AB L2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (L2-HGA) is a rare neurometabolic disease characterized by accumulation of L2-hydroxyglutarate (L2-HG), a potential oncome-tabolite resulting in significant lifetime risk for cerebral tumors. Herein, we present a case of intraventricular glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in a 16-year-old child with L2-HGA who presented with rapid functional decline and persistent vomiting. The tumor was completely resected, and the patient remained well at 2-year follow-up. Clinicians should be aware of the usual insidious nature of the disease. Rapid deterioration is unusual and should raise the suspicion of tumor development. This case also illustrates the importance of surveillance neuroimaging in patients with L2-HGA. To the best of our knowledge, only 1 case of GBM has been reported and it was sited in the temporal lobe, unlike the unusual intraventricular location in our case.

AB Postoperative continuous bloody cerebral spinal fluid drainage with external ventricular drainage catheter could decrease the incidence of inflammation. But the drainage catheter left in place will interrupt the watertight dura matter closure. To prevent the related cerebrospinal fluid leakage and subgaleal pseudomeningocele after the catheter removal, we developed a patched closure method to seal the dural outlet of the drainage catheter with a favorable clinical outcome.

AB BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) is a rare phenomenon in the dento-rubro-olivary pathway caused by lesion or disruption of the fibers of the Guillain-Mollaret triangle. Hemorrhage of pontine and midbrain cavernous angiomas can rarely lead to HOD portending neurologic deterioration and possible concomitant life-threatening complications; for this reason, it may define a poignant consideration in planning intervention.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 57-year-old woman with known midbrain-pontine cavernous angioma. For several years, the lesion had been stable, as shown by imaging follow-up, until 10 months before the patient presented with falls, dysarthria, and headache. Imaging showed some decrease in size as well as blood product around the cavernous angioma, suggesting interim period hemorrhage and interval development of HOD.
   CONCLUSIONS: The literature regarding imaging recommendations for stable cavernous angioma in the midbrain-pontine junction is reviewed. The implication of HOD for patient outcome is discussed and a comment is made on how the development of HOD may affect management of the cavernous angioma.

ID ORBIT
AB A 38-year-old woman presented with rapidly worsening, painless right monocular vision loss. An examination revealed a visual acuity of 1.4/10 and a central scotoma in the right eye. The orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a well-delineated ovoid intraconal mass of the right eye, hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI with homogenous enhancement after contrast injection. The mass abutted and displaced the optic nerve. A diagnosis of cavernous hemangioma was evoked, which is the most common benign adult orbital mass with these MRI features. A biopsy was performed, and the histopathologic examination yielded a diagnosis of optic nerve sheath meningioma based on a positive antiprogesterone receptor antibody immunostaining.
   Our case highlights the problem with establishing a specific pathologic diagnosis based on MRI alone, even though the morphologic aspect is evocative. It is recommended to always conduct a histopathologic examination before establishing a specific diagnosis as pathology remains the gold standard, especially when the course of action or treatment may change, as in our case.

TI The Enigma of Orbital Compartment Syndrome After Lumbar Spine Surgery in

ID PERIOPERATIVE VISUAL-LOSS; RETINAL ARTERY-OCCLUSION; OPHTHALMIC
   COMPLICATIONS; INTRAOCULAR-PRESSURE; BLINDNESS
AB BACKGROUND: Perioperative visual loss after spinal surgery is a devastating complication for the patient and the surgical team. Two known major causes are ischemic optic neuropathy and central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). Traditional understanding of CRAO has been consistently related to occurrence of periocular trauma and signs of increased intraorbital pressure in addition to visual loss. However, such orbital signs are not a feature of any common perioperative visual loss syndrome.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 55-year-old woman underwent prolonged lumbar decompression and fusion for spinal stenosis under general anesthesia in the prone position. At the end of surgery, periocular hyperemia, corneal edema, and a tense orbit on the right side were noted. Complete internal and external ophthalmoplegia was observed on examination. Orbital computed tomography confirmed the clinical diagnosis of orbital compartment syndrome. Bony decompression was performed, but the treated eye remained blind. Resolution of the complete ophthalmoplegia was observed during late follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: In retrospect, patients diagnosed with often misunderstood CRAO and ischemic optic neuropathy with orbital signs after spinal surgery most likely had orbital compartment syndrome. The inclusion of orbital signs in the clinical picture of ischemic optic neuropathy and CRAO is not only incorrect but also gives the impression of therapeutic futility, thereby preventing successful orbital decompression in a timely fashion.

DT Article
DE CSF leakage; Giant prolactinoma; Skull base
ID SKULL BASE; RECONSTRUCTION; DEFECTS
AB BACKGROUND: Leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) because of large prolactinomas represents a complex issue. Because of limited anatomic space, multiple leakage sites, and scarce locally available tissue for repair, surgical possibilities are limited. We report an initial case of using a radial fasciocutaneous flap applied subfrontally to cover a large skull base defect, supported by preoperative three-dimensional (3D) printing for surgical planning.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 29-year-old woman developed severe nuchal pain that was caused by destruction of large parts of her skull base by a prolactinoma. After occipitocervical fusion, medical treatment showed good tumor response but led to CSF leakage after 12 months. An endoscopic approach and ventriculoperitoneal shunt implantation failed to stop the leakage. A 3D model of the skull improved the understanding of the expanded osseous destruction and multiple CSF leakage sites and supported surgical planning. For an extensive coverage of the former clivus and sella region, an intracranially applied radial flap was planned. Dopamine-agonist medication was increased before the operation. Intraoperatively, the flap was brought into position subchiasmatically and wound around the pituitary stalk. CSF leakage was not observed on follow-up (10 weeks). Long-term follow-up will determine the effectiveness of this method.

AB A 30-year-old right-handed man with a history of schizophrenia presented with 2 self-inflicted drywall screws in the skull. The patient was sleepy but easily arousable; blood tests showed he had taken methamphetamines. Computed tomography and computed tomography angiography of the head showed the frontal screw abutted left of the superior sagittal sinus, and the posterior screw went through the superior sagittal sinus with no extravasation of contrast material at either site. Both screws were removed with exposure of the sagittal sinus using U-shaped craniectomies. There was no bleeding on the removal of the screws. It appears the posterior screw entered between the leaflets of the sagittal sinus dura mater. The patient had returned to work without any sequelae 1 month after injury.

AB BACKGROUND: Subdural empyema can present as a spinal subdural empyema (SSE) or a cranial subdural empyema (CSE). Although they differ somewhat in epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, and symptomatology and occur separately, they rarely manifest together. The aim of this article is to review the literature concerning the clinical presentation, clinical course, and treatment options for managing concurrently occurring SSE and CSE.
   METHODS: The literature in the Medline database was reviewed with key words including but not limited to subdural empyema, retroclival empyema, and Streptococcus mitis. No similar reports were found in the database involving infection with this type of microorganism in this anatomical region.
   RESULTS: Only 3 cases with concurrent CSE and SSE were found in the literature caused by various etiologic agents. Two of the patients recovered with no neurologic deficit, whereas one fatality was reported. One new illustrative case caused by Streptococcus mitis is also presented.
   CONCLUSIONS: CSE and SSE are neurosurgical emergencies, often requiring prompt surgical evacuation. Although very rare, Streptococcus mitis can cause spinal subdural empyema or retroclival abscesses. Natural history of this disease is grave without treatment. Delays in diagnosis and treatment are directly related to mortality and severe morbidity in patients with intracranial and spinal subdural empyema. Prompt recognition and treatment are essential to preclude severe neurologic disabilities or in rare cases a fatal outcome. A treatment paradigm for cranio-spinal empyema is proposed.

AB BACKGROUND: 5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-fluorescence-guided resection of malignant glioma is well established in many neuro-oncology departments. In addition, the use of 5-ALA has been reported for cerebral metastases, meningioma, and spinal tumors. We report a case of a patient with a leptomeningeal spread of a K27M-mutated spinal anaplastic astrocytoma (World Health Organization degrees [WHO] III), which was detected by its faint 5-ALA-induced fluorescence.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 26-year-old female patient with an incomplete resection of a spinal astrocytoma (WHO II) at Th1-Th3 was treated with adjuvant combined radiotherapy/chemotherapy. After 4 years the patient suffered from a progressive paraplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system showed no local progression of the spinal astrocytoma but an extensive disseminated leptomeningeal tumor formation. The cerebrospinal fluid of the patient obtained by lumbar puncture showed no indication of malignant cells in the cytopathologic examination. An open biopsy with preoperative administered 5-ALA with excision of the sensory nerve root from the cauda equina was performed. The biopsy showed a clearly light pink 5-ALA-induced fluorescence. The histopathologic examination confirmed a leptomeningeal spread of a K27Mmutated anaplastic astrocytoma (WH0 degrees III) without R132H-IDH1 mutation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Previous application of 5-ALA might intraoperatively help to visualize and identify leptomeningeal spread.

AB BACKGROUND:Giant intracranial aneurysms (>25 mm) are uncommon. These lesions typically manifest clinically due to mass effect, acute hemorrhage, or thromboembolic events. To minimize the risk of poor clinical outcome, detailed operative planning and a consideration of all neurosurgical and endovascular techniques are essential before proceeding with microsurgical clipping of ruptured giant aneurysms.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a case involving a 15-year-old male with a ruptured giant middle cerebral artery aneurysm treated with microsurgical clipping. After clip application, poor distal flow was demonstrated intraoperatively, and emergent angiography demonstrated an M1 occlusion with thrombus, A salvage procedure using endovascular mechanical thrombectomy reestablished distal flow resulting m a good neurologic outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case report to describe microsurgical clipping of an aneurysm followed by successful postoperative endovascular mechanical thrombectomy,

AB BACKGROUND: Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare, non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis that typically occurs in middle-aged patients. It is usually characterized by multifocal osteosclerotic lesions of the long-bones, however many cases have extraskeletal involvement. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is common, but isolated CNS involvement at presentation has rarely been reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we report two cases of dural-based ECD mimicking meningioma on imaging with no other identified sites of disease.
   CONCLUSION: ECD is a rare disease, with isolated CNS involvement reported only a few times in the literature. The significance of this presentation requires additional study and long-term follow up.

   DECOMPRESSION
AB BACKGROUND: The transnasal approach to lesions involving the craniovertebral junction represents a technical challenge because of limited inferior exposure. The endoscopic transseptal approach (EtsA) with posterior nasal spine (PNS) removal is described. This technique can create a wide exposure of the craniovertebral junction, thereby increasing the caudal exposure.
   METHODS: On patients undergoing anterior craniovertebral junction decompression, we calculated the degree of exposure on the sagittal plan through a paraseptal route, an EtsA without and with PNS removal. The horizontal exposure and working area with the latter approach were also evaluated.
   RESULTS: Five patients underwent the transnasal procedure. The age of patients ranged from 34-71 years. All patients harbored basilar impression. The mean post-operative Nurick grade (1, 8) was improved versus the average preoperative grade (3). The average follow-up duration was 16 months. All patients underwent occipito-cervical fixation. The mean vertical distances, from the clinoid recess to the inferior most limit with the paraseptal approach, EtsA without and with PNS removal were 38.52, 44.12, and 51.16 mm, respectively. The difference between our approach and a standard paraseptal route was statistically significant (P = 0.041; P<0.05). The mean horizontal distances were 31.68 mm (mononostril entry) and 35.37 mm (binostril entry). The mean working area was 1795.53 mm(2).
   CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic endonasal approaches to the craniovertebral junction are increasing, but the downward extension on the anterior cervical spine represents a limit. Therefore, many surgeons prefer transoral or transcervical approaches. The EtsA with PNS removal allows for a more caudal exposure than the standard paraseptal approach, with reduced nasal trauma.

AB BACKGROUND: Collet-Sicard syndrome is a rare manifestation of skull base disease involving the jugular and hypoglossal foramina. We report the first case of Collet-Sicard attributable to extramedullary plasmacytoma-multiple myeloma (EP-MM) and the second case of EP-MM precipitating a jugular foramen syndrome (JFS)-spectrum disorder.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 59-year-old woman presented with 4 months of left aural fullness and pulsatile tenderness, positional vertigo, hoarseness, and dysphagia. Examination identified left tongue weakness and nonspecific sensory abnormalities of the ear, pharynx, and throat localizing to cranial nerves IXeXII. Imaging revealed a 3.4 x 1.4 x 2.8 cm lytic lesion extending from the left jugular foramen into the posterior fossa, for which she was referred to neurosurgery and otolaryngology for consideration of resection. A second, much smaller (1.1-cm) lytic lesion in the left posterior occipital bone was incidentally discovered by the surgeon during preoperative consultation. A stereotactic biopsy of the occipital lesion was subsequently recommended, which identified plasma cell neoplasm. Serum studies and skeletal survey were consistent with MM, and a definitive pathologic diagnosis of MM with cranial EP was confirmed by bone marrow biopsy.
   CONCLUSION: Tumors of the jugular foramen present with a diverse array of lower cranial nerve deficits, including Collet-Sicard syndrome, a rare subset of JFS-spectrum diseases. Paragangliomas are the most common jugular foramen neoplasms, followed by schwannomas and meningiomas; however, many other rare entities have been reported as masqueraders, and diligent work-up with consideration for preliminary biopsy is recommended, particularly in the presence of additional lesions, equivocal imaging findings, or cases arousing high suspicion.

AB BACKGROUND: Flexible endoscopes have both a wide range of movement and a wide field of view and are therefore widely used for endoscopic third ventriculostomy and biopsy. However, tumor resection around the aqueduct of Sylvius using flexible endoscopes has scarcely been reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report 2 cases of tumor resection around the aqueduct of Sylvius. The first case is a 38-year-old man presenting with progressive headache, nausea, and diplopia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 1.4 cm nonenhancing mass at the entry of the aqueduct of Sylvius and occlusive hydrocephalus. We performed tumor resection and endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) simultaneously. His symptoms disappeared after the operation. Final pathologic diagnosis was ancient schwannoma. The second case is a 78-year-old woman presenting with progressive disturbance of consciousness (coma). MRI showed 0.7 cm nonenhancing mass at the entry of the aqueduct of Sylvius and occlusive hydrocephalus. We performed tumor resection and ETV similarly. Her consciousness improved after the operation. Final tumor diagnosis was cavernous malformation. In both cases there was no additional neurologic deficit after the surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: By using a flexible endoscope for tumor dissection, resection of a tumor without a neck, which cannot be removed through aspiration alone, becomes possible. To our knowledge, the presented cases are the first to describe the effectiveness of complete resection of a tumor in the third ventricle using flexible endoscopy.

AB BACKGROUND: There is no standard salvage treatment for recurrent and/or unresectable brainstem low-grade gliomas after failure from carboplatin and vincristine chemotherapy. Recombinant human endostatin (rh-ES), a mild inhibitor of angiogenesis, has been used for treating lung cancer. But so far as we know, there is no experience for brainstem gliomas.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The authors present a pediatric case of recurrent brainstem pilocytic astrocytoma with neuraxis dissemination who experienced tumor progression with carboplatin and vincristine chemotherapy but then had a dramatic and long-term remission for at least 29 months after combined treatment of rh-ES with carboplatin and vincristine.
   CONCLUSION: This case suggests that the addition of rh-ES to carboplatin and vincristine regimens may be synergistic and results in a long-term remission in patients with brainstem low-grade gliomas, even if the tumor is widely spread in the central nervous system.

AB BACKGROUND: Spontaneous acute arterial subdural hematoma (SDH) is a rare entity caused by hemorrhage from a cortical perisylvian artery without a known precipitant.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 53-year-old man presented with a 2-day history of acute-onset headache and dysphasia. He had a generalized seizure on arrival to hospital and no history of trauma. A computed tomography demonstrated an acute left-sided SDH. A computed tomography angiogram and a digital subtraction angiogram demonstrated active contrast extravasation into the SDH. A craniotomy was performed to evacuate the hematoma; the bleeding perisylvian artery was visualized and coagulated.
   CONCLUSIONS: We report a rare case of acute SDH and present a review of the literature. The etiology, investigation, and management of this rare neurosurgical emergency are discussed.

ID FISTULA; LIPOMYELOMENINGOCELE; LIPOMYELODYSPLASIA; LIPOMENINGOCELE
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal vascular malformations as a group are rare, and coexistence of a spinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in or around the spinal dysraphism is extremely rare. We report 2 cases of combined spinal dysraphism and vascular malformations of the spinal cord.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The first case was an AVM located in a filum terminale lipoma fed by the artery of the filum terminale. This case was managed by multiple endovascular embolizations followed by surgery. The second case was an AVM located in a lumbar lipomyelocele managed by endovascular embolization. These cases illustrate the imaging findings of a rare entity and present the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular embolization combined with surgical resection is the most commonly used treatment for spinal dysraphism with spinal cord AVM. Careful analysis of spinal angiography is necessary owing to the distorted vascular and surgical anatomy of the region affected by spinal dysraphism.

AB BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) simulators have become useful tools in various fields of medicine. Prominent uses of VR technologies include assessment of physician skills and presurgical planning. VR has shown effectiveness in multiple surgical specialties, yet its use in neurosurgery remains limited.
   OBJECTIVE: To examine all current literature on VR-based simulation for presurgical planning and training in cranial tumor surgeries and to assess the quality of these studies.
   METHODS: PubMed and Embase were systematically searched to identify studies that used VR for presurgical planning and/or studies that investigated the use of VR as a training tool from inception to May 25, 2017.
   RESULTS: The initial search identified 1662 articles. Thirty-seven full-text articles were assessed for inclusion. Nine studies were included. These studies were subdivided into presurgical planning and training using VR.
   CONCLUSIONS: Prospects for VR are bright when surgical planning and skills training are considered. In terms of surgical planning, VR has noted and documented usefulness in the planning of cranial surgeries. Further, VR has been central to establishing reproducible benchmarks of performance in relation to cranial tumor resection, which are helpful not only in showing face and construct validity but also in enhancing neurosurgical training in a way not previously examined. Although additional studies are needed to better delineate the precise role of VR in each of these capacities, these studies stand to show the usefulness of VR in the neurosurgery and highlight the need for further investigation.

AB Cavernous sinus hemangiomas (CSHs) are rare vascular tumors, which are infrequently encountered in everyday neurosurgical practice. Attempted resection of this lesion without preoperative planning carries a high risk for significant blood loss and cranial neuropathies. Radiation treatments can provide an alternative and safe treatment modality for these lesions. Therefore an increased awareness is warranted for their clinical suspicion. We reported on a patient who presented with visual deficits and a mass in the sellar, suprasellar, and middle fossa regions. Given the high suspicion for a CSH due to characteristic radiologic findings, a keyhole craniotomy approach was safely used for an open biopsy. The final pathology was consistent with a CSH, and the patient subsequently underwent radiation therapy without complications.

   BRAIN; METAANALYSIS
AB OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the diagnostic performance of increased signal intensity within the resection cavity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences for detection of progression in patients with glioma through performing a meta-analysis.
   METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure were searched for potentially relevant literature. The study characteristics and relevant data were extracted. We estimated the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratios, negative likelihood ratios, and diagnostic odds ratio and constructed summary receiver operating characteristics curves to identify the diagnostic value of FLAIR signal increase for detection of glioma progression.
   RESULTS: A total of 4 studies with 438 patients were included. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of increased signal intensity in FLAIR sequences in the resection cavity for detection of glioma progression were 0.36 (95% confidence interval 0.31-0.42) and 0.93 (95% confidence interval 0.86-0.97), respectively. The area under the curve was 0.7505. Subgroup analyses also were performed according to different patient sources, tumor grades, and definitions of progression. No significant publication bias was found in the meta-analysis (P = 0.85).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that increased signal intensity within the resection cavity on FLAIR sequences could indicate tumor progression early with high specificity in patients with glioma. This readily accessible sign could implicate closer monitoring and could be crucial for therapeutic decisions and outcome. However, because of the limited number of studies, more well-designed studies are warranted to further verify our results and elucidate the underlining mechanisms.

AB BACKGROUND: A bibliometric uses the citation count of an article to determine its impact on the clinical world. There is a paucity of literature concerning top article citations on spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The main objective of this investigation was to bridge this gap and to provide understanding of the trends on the most influential articles written on this subject.
   METHODS: The Scopus Library database was searched to determine the citations of all articles published on spontaneous ICH. Articles that focused on other forms of ICH, such as trauma-related hemorrhages, subarachnoid hemorrhages, or hemorrhages caused by anticoagulation, vascular malformations, or cavernomas, were excluded from our list. The articles were divided into 2 groups: "specific" articles, which focused specifically on spontaneous ICH, and "generalized" articles, which were about ICH in general, including spontaneous as well as other forms of ICH. We did not apply any time or study-type restriction in our search. The top 100 cited articles were selected and analyzed by 2 independent investigators.
   RESULTS: J. Broderick was the author with most publications in the list (n = 21). The largest subset of spontaneous ICH articles was published in the 5-year periods from 1996 to 2000 and 2001 to 2005 (n = 27 each). The United States had the highest number of articles (n = 49). The journal with the highest number of top 100 cited articles was Stroke, with 39, followed by Neurology with 16.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies the trends related to spontaneous ICH by analyzing the citation frequency of the most-cited articles in the field.

AB BACKGROUND: Suboccipital decompressive craniectomy (SDC) for cerebellar infarction has been traditionally performed with minimal high-quality evidence. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate the impact of SDC on functional outcomes, mortality, and adverse events in patients with cerebellar infarcts.
   METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Our primary outcome was the proportion of patients with moderate-severe disability after SDC. Secondary outcomes included mortality and adverse events. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the roles of age, pre-operative neurologic status, external ventricular drain insertion, and debridement of infarcted tissue on SDC outcomes.
   RESULTS: Eleven studies (with 283 patients) met our inclusion criteria. The pooled event rate for moderate-severe disability was 28% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20%-37%) and for mortality, it was 20% (95% CI, 12%-31%). The estimated overall rate of adverse events for SDC was 23% (95% CI, 14%-35%). Sensitivity analysis found less mortality with mean age <60 years, higher rates of concomitant external ventricular drain insertion, and debridement of infarcted tissue. Several factors were identified for heterogeneity between studies, including follow-up time, outcomes scale, extent of infarction, and other neuroimaging features.
   CONCLUSIONS: The best available evidence for SDC is based on retrospective observational studies. SDC for cerebellar infarction is associated with better outcomes compared with decompressive surgery for hemispheric infarctions. Lack of standardized reporting methods for SDC is a considerable drawback to the development of a better understanding of the impact of this surgery on patient outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Posterior fossa decompression without (PFD) or with duraplasty (PFDD) for the treatment of type 1 Chiari malformation (CM-1) is controversial. We thus performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies to assess the effect on clinical and imaging improvement, operative time, complications, and recurrence rate between PFD and PFDD in patients with CM-1.
   METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Knowledge, and ClinicalTrials. gov for retrospective or prospective studies comparing PFD with PFDD. Our main end points were clinical and imaging improvement, operative time, complications, and recurrence rate. We assessed pooled data by use of a fixed-effects or random-effects model according to the between-study heterogeneity.
   RESULTS: Of 214 identified studies, 13 were eligible and were included in our analysis (N=3481 patients). Compared with PFD, PFDD led to a mean greater increase in operative time than did PFD [standardized mean difference, -2.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], (-2.70 to -1.99)], a higher likelihood of clinical improvement in patients with syringomyelia (relative risk [RR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.49-0.98), no increased RR of clinical improvement in patients without syringomyelia, no increased RR of imaging improvement, but an increased RR of cerebrospinal fluiderelated complications (RR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.15-0.58), cerebrospinal fluid leak, aseptic meningitis, pseudomeningocele, and a decreased likelihood of recurrence rate.
   CONCLUSIONS: PFDD can be an optimal surgical strategy because of its higher clinical improvement and lower recurrence rate in the patients with syringomyelia. In patients without syringomyelia, PFD can be a preferred choice because of its similar clinical improvement and lower costs. Future randomized studies with large numbers and the power to provide illumination for surgical decision making in CM-1 are warranted.

AB BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical educators strive to identify the best applicants, yet formal study of resident selection has proved difficult. We conducted a systematic review to answer the following question: What objective and subjective preresidency factors predict resident success?
   METHODS: PubMed, ProQuest, Embase, and the CINAHL databases were queried from 1952 to 2015 for literature reporting the impact of preresidency factors (PRFs) on outcomes of residency success (RS), among neurosurgery and all surgical subspecialties. Due to heterogeneity of specialties and outcomes, a qualitative summary and heat map of significant findings were constructed.
   RESULTS: From 1489 studies, 21 articles met inclusion criteria, which evaluated 1276 resident applicants across five surgical subspecialties. No neurosurgical studies met the inclusion criteria. Common objective PRFs included standardized testing (76%), medical school performance (48%), and Alpha Omega Alpha (43%). Common subjective PRFs included aggregate rank scores (57%), letters of recommendation (38%), research (33%), interviews (19%), and athletic or musical talent (19%). Outcomes of RS included faculty evaluations, intraining/board exams, chief resident status, and research productivity. Among objective factors, standardized test scores correlated well with in-training/board examinations but poorly correlated with faculty evaluations. Among subjective factors, aggregate rank scores, letters of recommendation, and athletic or musical talent demonstrated moderate correlation with faculty evaluations.
   CONCLUSION: Standardized testing most strongly correlated with future examination performance but correlated poorly with faculty evaluations. Moderate predictors of faculty evaluations were aggregate rank scores, letters of recommendation, and athletic or musical talent. The ability to predict success of neurosurgical residents using an evidence-based approach is limited, and few factors have correlated with future resident performance. Given the importance of recruitment to the greater field of neurosurgery, these data provide support for a national, prospective effort to improve the study of neurosurgery resident selection.

TI The Relationship Between Hematoma and Pachymeninges in an Interdural
   Hematoma: Diagnosis and Surgical Strategy

AB BACKGROUND: The exact location of a hematoma in relation to the pachymeninges contributes to typical radiographic presentations. However, because of the complexity of hematoma evolution and neomembrane formation, an unexpected intraoperative finding can lead to a change of surgical strategy. In addition, the concentration of hemoglobin and its degradation products, the integrity of red blood cells, and the infiltration of fibroblasts, polymorphonuclear neutrophils, and macrophages are factors that affect the imaging characteristics on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging as the hematoma ages.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An interdural hematoma (IDH)-a hemorrhage that splits the periosteal dura mater from the meningeal dura mater-is an extremely rare occurrence, and the diagnosis requires confirmation by surgical or pathologic findings. By presenting a case of an IDH that was misdiagnosed as a chronic subdural hematoma before surgery, and reviewing the literature, we propose the radiologic characteristics of presenting both dural border sign and dural beak sign on magnetic resonance imaging as a specific indicator for IDH preoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: A careful evaluation of cerebral expansion before membranectomy was mandatory intraoperatively. For IDH, wide inner membranectomy (i.e., excision of meningeal dura mater) should not be necessary. An IDH should be considered as a distinct disease category when evaluating an extra-axial hematoma despite its rarity, because the characters of radiologic, histopathologic findings are different. In addition, surgical strategy varies for epidural or subdural hematoma in different hematoma stages.

AB OBJECTIVE: A precise anatomical description of the alar ligaments is important to better understand their biomechanical and pathologic implications. Although there are several studies regarding their anatomy, the literature is inconsistent. To our knowledge, there are no reports that compare cadaveric morphologic findings with computed tomography (CT) images of the alar ligaments.
   METHODS: Eight sides from 4 fresh-frozen cadaveric specimens were used in this study. After routine dissection of the craniocervical junction, the alar ligaments were exposed. We carried out measurements of the alar ligaments, their position within the craniovertebral junction, and their relation to the dens and adjacent structures. Fine-cut CT of the specimens was performed, and the measurements were later compared with the original cadaveric dissections.
   RESULTS: Alar ligaments were attached to the upper half of the lateral surface of the dens and ran laterally to its insertion just medial to the occipital condyle. The ligaments were found to have an ovoid cross-sectional area with a nearly horizontal caudocranial trajectory and comparable diameters in both anteroposterior and superoinferior directions between the CT and cadaveric measurements.
   CONCLUSIONS: There were small but not statistically significant differences in the measurements between the cadaver specimens and the CT images. There was however, a strong correlation between the proximal and distal insertions, as well as the orientation of the fibers, that suggests CT images can be an appropriate approach to the study of the anatomical and 3-dimensional features of the alar ligaments.

AB BACKGROUND: To date, trabecular morphology studies have been conducted on thin-section computed tomography (CT) scans of cadaveric bone. Here we describe the trabecular anatomy of the axis vertebra as revealed by an innovative imaging tool.
   METHODS: Ten patients who underwent thin-slice CT scans for suspected cervical spine injury were prospectively subjected to shaded volume-rendered 3-dimensional reconstruction of the images. The trabecular anatomy thus depicted was recreated, and the mechanical vectors were deduced independently by a senior radiologist and spine surgeon and then matched. The clinical implications were postulated.
   RESULTS: The most striking trabeculae are the vertical compression trabeculae connecting the C1 facet to the C3 body. The center of the body of C2 has a space with sparse trabeculae; similarly, the pars interarticularis also has a clear void. The dens contain predominantly tensile trabeculae that are retained even in older patients. Midline remnants of the odontoid body synchondrosis persist even into late adulthood.
   CONCLUSIONS: Shaded volume-rendered imaging appears to be an excellent tool for studying the trabecular anatomy of cancellous bone. The weight-bearing trabeculae run from the C1-2 facet to the C3 body; the inferior facet contributes little to weight-bearing.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the musculoskeletal and soft tissue neural alterations in cases with group A basilar invagination.
   METHODS: Between January 2007 and August 2016, 510 patients with group A basilar invagination were surgically treated. The radiologic images of these patients were reviewed retrospectively. The patients were divided into 4 groups: group A1, comprising 60 patients with syringomyelia; group A2, comprising 354 patients with "external syrinx," marked by excessive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the extramedullary space; group A3, comprising 51 patients with both syringomyelia and external syrinx; and group A4, comprising 45 patients with no abnormality of CSF cavitation in the spinal canal.
   RESULTS: A number of musculoskeletal and neural parameters, including the extent of basilar invagination, degree of angulation of the odontoid process, and facet malalignment, were evaluated in each of the 4 groups. The degree of basilar invagination was 6-27.4 mm (average, 15.85 mm) in group A1, 4.3-24.5 mm (average, 12.56 mm) in group A2, 5.6-17.6 mm (average 10.8 mm) in group A3, and 5.2-17.3 mm (average, 11.74 mm) in group A4. The angle of inclination of the odontoid process was 61.1-90.7 degrees (average, 71.4 degrees) in group A1, 30.5-79.8 degrees (average, 60.05 degrees) in group A2, 68.5-78.3 degrees (average, 73.4 degrees) in group A3, and 62.2-87.4 degrees (average, 71.2 degrees) in group A4.
   CONCLUSIONS: The nature of bone malformations directly influences the presence or absence of external syrinx and syringomyelia.

AB BACKGROUND: We compiled a comprehensive literature review on the anatomic and clinical results of endoscopic approaches to the craniocervical junction (CVJ) to better contribute to identify the best strategy.
   METHODS: An updated literature review was performed in the PubMed, OVID, and Google Scholar medical databases, using the terms "Craniovertebral junction," "Transoral approach," "Transnasal approach," "Transcervical approach," " Endoscopic endonasal approach," " Endoscopic transoral approach," " Endoscopic transcervical approach." Clinical series, anatomic studies, and comparative studies were reviewed.
   RESULTS: Pure endonasal and cervical endoscopic approaches still have some disadvantages, including the learning curve and the deeper surgical field. Endoscopically assisted transoral surgery with 30 degrees endoscopes represents an emerging option to standard microsurgical techniques for transoral approaches to the anterior CVJ. This approach should be considered as complementary rather than an alternative to the traditional microsurgical transoral-transpharyngeal approach.
   CONCLUSIONS: The transoral approach with sparing of the soft palate still remains the gold standard compared with the pure transnasal and transcervical approaches because of the wider working channel provided by the former technique. The transnasal endoscopic approach alone appears to be superior when the CVJ lesion exceeds the upper limit of the inferior third of the clivus.

LA English
DT Article
DE Atlantoaxial instability; Cervical trauma; Odontoid fracture
ID ANTERIOR; PLATE; AXIS
AB OBJECTIVE: The authors analyze 124 cases with fracture of odontoid process. All patients were surgically treated by posterior atlantoaxial fixation.
   METHODS: There were 96 male and 28 female patients. The ages of the patients ranged from 12 to 80 years. Apart from Anderson and D'Alonzo type I (6 cases), type II (93 cases) and type III (25 cases), three sub-types of odontoid fractures were included in the classification. In type A (118 cases), there was vertical compression fracture that resulted in malalignment of the fractured odontoid process segments. Type B (49 cases) resulted when the fracture resulted in malalignment of the facets of atlas and axis. Type C (25 cases) included cases in which the fracture line involved the facet of axis. Fractures were divided into acute type when the injury was less than 3 months old (50 cases), delayed type when the injury was between 3 months to one year (34 cases) and chronic type when the injury was more than 1 year in duration (40 cases). All patients were treated with posterior atlantoaxial fixation with the techniques described in 1994 and 2004. Follow-up period ranged from 6 to 156 months (average 72 months).
   RESULTS: All patients improved in symptoms after surgery. There were no significant postoperative complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Posterior atlantoaxial stabilization forms a safe surgical strategy for all kinds of odontoid fractures. Additional characteristics of odontoid fractures further subclassified them and assisted in surgical decision-making and in formulating the surgical strategy.

   BASILAR INVAGINATION; REDUCTION; RELEASE; FUSION
AB BACKGROUND: The transoral approach provides the most direct exposure to extradural lesions of the ventral craniovertebral junction. The morbidity and mortality from this approach greatly limits its use because they are still feared and debated. Using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses, this study aims to identify the factors associated with short-term complications in patients undergoing the transoral approach.
   METHODS: A consecutive cohort analysis of prospectively collected data in several neurosurgery spine departments evaluated 143 consecutive patients who had undergone craniovertebral junction transoral approach surgery. The mean age at the time of surgery was 45.1 +/- 19.1 years. The study analyzed the comorbidities, the operative procedure, and postoperative morbidity and mortality.
   RESULTS: Seventeen patients (11.9%) had a postoperative complication in the first month. In our univariable analysis: age, smoking, tumor etiology, preoperative posterior fixation, posterior bone graft, preoperative external lumbar shunt, and the transoral approach pathway were significantly associated with postoperative mortality and morbidity. In our multivariable analyses, preoperative external lumbar shunt was significantly associated with complication risks (odds ratio [OR] 6.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1-21.7, P < 0.001), whereas preoperative posterior fixation (OR 0.28; 95% CI 0.08-1.1, P < 0.04) and posterior bone graft (OR 0.14; 95% CI 0.03-0.6, P < 0.008) were significantly associated with lower complication risks.
   CONCLUSIONS: To reduce complications, it is essential to be aware of and to manage these preoperative risk factors. In such manner, we insinuate that postoperative complications depend on the surgeon's familiarity with the transoral approach.

ID NERVE SHEATH TUMORS; FIXATION; SURGERY; SERIES
AB OBJECTIVE: We report our experience with surgery in 50 patients with C2 neurinomas. The anatomic subtleties of these discrete forms of tumors and their surgical implications are analyzed.
   METHODS: During the period 2006-2016, we operated on 50 patients with 55 C2 neurinomas. Type A tumors were located within the spinal canal, type B tumors were located in the lateral gutter, and type C tumors had a paraspinal extension. By working within the dural confines of the tumor and appropriately angulating the microscope, the entire tumor bulk extending into 1 or all 3 compartments was resected. Follow-up duration ranged from 3 months to 10 years (mean 68 months).
   RESULTS: This series included 36 male and 14 female patients. Age range of patients was 14-70 years (mean age 36 years). Progressive symptoms of myelopathy were present in 41 patients. There were 16 type A + B tumors, 27 type B tumors, 10 type BDC tumors, and 2 type A + B + C tumors. All patients experienced symptom improvement after surgery and were able to resume their normal lifestyle.
   CONCLUSIONS: C2 neurinomas arise in the region of the C2 ganglion, and despite the fact that some achieve a large size, they remain confined within the dura. Radical tumor resection can be achieved by working within the layers of the dural cover. Bone removal and opening of spinal dura for tumor exposure and resection can be avoided.

AB OBJECTIVE: Craniovertebral junction (CVJ) meningiomas are one of the most surgically complex conditions in neurooncologic surgery. The aim of this work is to correlate our data with clinical outcome to outline factors leading to a worse functional prognosis.
   METHODS: We analyzed sex, age, clinical presentation, topography, surgical approach, Simpson grade resection, postoperative lower cranial nerve deficits, consistency, histology, site of origin, presence of a capsule, and radiologic and clinical follow-up at 1, 6, and 12 months of 61 patients affected by CVJ meningiomas, operated on in our institution from 1992 to 2014.
   RESULTS: 78.7% of patients were women (mean age, 52.85 years); the onset symptom was pain in 65.5% of cases. The mean preoperative Nurick grade of the sample was 3.78; the most frequent histologic type was endotheliomatous (42.8%). We treated 22 patients with a posterior median approach (5 with lateral and 17 with posterolateral axial topography); in 39 cases (30 anterolateral and 9 anterior) we performed a posterolateral approach. Gross total removal was achieved in 85.2% of cases. We recorded a final follow-up step overall neurologic improvement in the cohort (average preoperative Nurick grade, 3.81, and at 12 months, 2.13). Twenty-nine patients presented with lower cranial nerve deficit (permanent or transient) and no statistically significant association was found between surgical approach and temporary or permanent postoperative complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: We selected, in our experience, some predictors of worse outcome: preoperative sphincter impairment, absence of a capsule, cranial site of origin, a poor preoperative functional status, and firm consistency of the tumor.

AB OBJECTIVE: For many years, the microsurgical transoral approach (TOA) has been accepted as the "gold standard" for the surgical treatment of a variety of congenital, developmental, and acquired pathologies affecting the craniovertebral junction. In the present study, we try to investigate both experimental and clinical fronts of such a challenging surgery, starting from the updated literature experience. TOA is actually presented as an "old-fashioned" surgical technique dealing with possible bacterial contamination, the need of postoperative nose gastric tube feeding for a week, the possible nasopharyngeal incompetence, and the postoperative tongue swelling. Otherwise, the endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) appears strongly supported by the modern literature as the true "minimally invasive" procedure.
   METHODS: Our clinical experience deals with 23 anterior procedures in paediatric and adult patients (17 TOA and 6 EEA). We further report on our experimental cadaver laboratory study of 12 subjects.
   RESULTS: All the patients of TOA group but one were discharged after posterior procedures within two weeks and improved or remained unchanged after surgery and during the follow-up. No mayor complications occurred in TOA group. In EEA group two patients died for cerebrospinal fluid infection, for disease progression and for heart attack.
   CONCLUSION: Our and other available data suggest that no clear superiority of EEA over endoscopic TOA can be assessed so far; on the other hand, EEA can produce complications similar to TOA in craniovertebral junction surgery.

ID ATLANTOAXIAL DISLOCATION; CONGENITAL ABSENCE; BASILAR INVAGINATION;
   FIXATION; PLATE; AXIS
AB BACKGROUND: We present 2 cases involving a previously unreported clinical situation in which basilar invagination, atlantoaxial instability, and C2-3 instability were associated with a bifid posterior arch of the axis bone.
   CASE DESCRIPTIONS: Two young males presented with limb weakness, spasticity, and paresthesias. Both patients had altered voice quality, with reduced and thin volume, and difficulty sleeping supine. Radiologic imaging showed an absence of the posterior elements of the C2 vertebrae. The C3 spinous process mimicked the C2 spinous process in shape and size. C1-2 and C2-3 posterior fixations were performed.
   CONCLUSIONS: C1-2 and C2-3 fixation resulted in firm fixation of the region and a remarkable clinical recovery. The most significant features were an immediate postoperative improvement in voice quality and the ability to sleep comfortably in the supine position.

TI Traumatic Atlantoaxial Spondyloptosis Associated with Displaced Odontoid
   Fracture: Complete Reduction via Posterior Approach Using "Joint
   Remodeling" Technique

ID BASILAR INVAGINATION; DISLOCATION; FIXATION; DISTRACTION; COMPRESSION;
   EXTENSION; SCREW
AB BACKGROUND: Atlantoaxial spondyloptosis (AAS), which is defined as complete displacement of facets of atlas anterior to the facets of axis such that there is no contact between the 2 articulating surfaces, is an extremely rare manifestation of atlantoaxial instability. The reason for an extreme rarity of traumatic AAS is probably the severity of injury in traumatic AAS that is usually incompatible to life. It represents the most severe form of atlantoaxial dislocation, and complete reduction in such a case presents a real technical challenge because of the interlocking of C1-C2 facets. Cranial traction fails to achieve reduction in such cases.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In this report, we describe a case of traumatic odontoid fracture associated with AAS and discuss our technique of complete reduction of deformity via posterior approach. An 11-year-old child presented to us 4 months after a road traffic accident with progressive spastic quadriparesis. On evaluation, displaced type II odontoid fracture with AAS was detected. The patient underwent surgery via posterior approach. The techniques of "joint manipulation" and "joint remodeling" were used to achieve complete reduction of spondyloptosis. Postoperative imaging showed complete reduction of deformity. The patient also improved neurologically after surgery.
   CONCLUSION: This case report aims to present the ability of "joint manipulation" and "joint remodeling" techniques in achieving excellent reduction in even one of the most difficult post-traumatic deformities that affect the craniovertebral junction.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine whether preoperative chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with inferior perioperative outcomes in patients undergoing lumbar arthrodesis.
   METHODS: Medical records of 293 adult (>= 18 years old) patients with spine deformity undergoing elective lumbar spine decompression and fusion at a major academic institution from 2006 to 2015 were reviewed. We identified 18 (6.1%) patients with a clinical diagnosis of CKD (CKD group, n = 18; no-CKD group, n = 275). Patient demographics, comorbidities, and intraoperative and postoperative complication rates were collected for each patient. The primary endpoint was incidence of postoperative complications.
   RESULTS: Patient demographics, including age, sex, and body mass index, and comorbidities were similar between cohorts. The CKD group had a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and anemia compared with the no-CKD group. Median number of fusion levels, length of surgery, and estimated blood loss were similar between both cohorts. Postoperative complication profile was significantly different between the cohorts, with the CKD group having a significantly higher proportion of patients transferred to the intensive care unit (52.9% vs. 29.3%, P = 0.04) with episodes of delirium (27.8% vs. 8.4%, P = 0.007), urinary tract infection (27.8% vs. 6.9%, P = 0.0002), and deep vein thrombosis (5.6% vs. 0.4%, P = 0.01). Although not significant, the CKD group had a 2-fold higher rate of 30-day readmissions compared with the no-CKD group (CKD group: 27.8% vs. no-CKD group: 12.7%, P = 0.07).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that patients with CKD may be more likely to develop perioperative complications after lumbar arthrodesis. Future studies are necessary to corroborate our findings.

ID NON-HOME DISCHARGE; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; IMPAIRMENT; RISK; PREDICTION; CARE
AB BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to determine whether preoperative scores on a screening measure for cognitive status (the Saint Louis University mental status examination), were associated with discharge to a location other than home in older patients undergoing surgery for deformity.
   METHODS: Older patients (>= 65 years) undergoing a planned elective spinal surgery for correction of adult degenerative scoliosis were enrolled in this study. Preoperative baseline cognition was assessed using the validated Saint Louis University mental status (SLUMS) test. SLUMS is 11 questions with a maximum of 30 points. Mild cognitive impairment was defined as a SLUMS score of 21-26 points, and severe cognitive impairment as a SLUMS score of 20 points or greater. Normal cognition was defined as a SLUMS score of 27 points or more. Postoperative length of stay and discharge location were recorded on all patients.
   RESULTS: Eighty-two subjects were included, with mean +/- standard deviation age of 73.26 +/- 6.08 years; 51% of patients were discharged to a facility (skilled nursing or acute rehabilitation). After adjustment for demographic variables, comorbidities, and baseline cognitive impairment, patients with preoperative cognitive impairment were 4-fold more likely to be discharged to a facility (skilled nursing or acute rehabilitation) compared with patients with normal cognitive status (odds ratio [OR], 3.93). In addition, patients who were not ambulatory before surgery were also more likely to be discharged to a facility (OR, 7.14).
   CONCLUSIONS: In geriatric patients undergoing surgery for deformity correction, cognitive screening before surgery can identify patients with impaired cognitive status who are less likely than those with normal cognitive status to return home after surgery.

TI An Evaluation of Commonly Used External Ventricular Drain Securement
   Methods in a Porcine Model: Recommendations to Improve Practice
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Cerebrospinal fluid; External ventricular drain; Securement; Technique;
   Ventriculitis
ID INFECTIONS; PLACEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: External ventricular drain (EVD) dislodgement is common and leads to significant morbidity and mortality. Many securement techniques to prevent this are described. There are, however, no objective studies comparing them. This study aimed to determine the most secure method of securing an EVD.
   METHODS: A survey was distributed through the British Neurosurgical Trainee Research Collaborative to determine common EVD securement methods and select techniques for testing. Securement methods were tested in a pig cadaver model. Peak pull force before EVD failure was measured. Failure was defined as catheter displacement 1 cm from the insertion site, catheter fracture, or suture fracture.
   RESULTS: Twenty-three neurosurgical units responded. Five basic EVD securement methods were in common use. These were tested in isolation and in combination so that in total 15 common methods were tested. The most secure method was a triple construct, consisting of an anchoring suture, sutures around a coil of the catheter, and either a soft plastic flange (25.85 N, 95% confidence interval 24.95 N-26.75 N) or a hard plastic flange (29.05 N, 95% confidence interval 25.69 N-32.41 N). Of the individual methods, single anchoring sutures, soft flanges, VentriFix, and staples were found to be the least secure, whereas multiple sutures and hard flanges were the most secure.
   CONCLUSIONS: An anchoring suture followed by a coil of the catheter and finally a flange is the most secure method for securing EVDs. This simple technique can withstand up to 8.2 times the force of a single anchoring suture, is easily used, and decreases the likelihood of EVD dislodgement and associated complications.

AB BACKGROUND: Low-grade glioma (LGG) is a slow-growing tumor often found in young adults with minimal or no symptoms. As opposed to true low-grade lesions such as dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors, they are associated with continuous growth and inevitable malignant transformation.
   METHODS: Case series of patients who have had en bloc resection of LGG with foci of anaplasia found embedded within the tumor specimen and not at margins. Patients were offered and agreed to a conservative approach avoiding adjuvant therapy.
   RESULTS: In the current case series, we describe a small subset of LGG that have shown foci of high-grade glioma but have shown behavior and growth tendencies similar to LGG after radical surgical resection. No patient to date has shown recurrent disease requiring adjuvant therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case series supports the use of early aggressive surgical treatment of grade II gliomas that are premalignant. It acts as proof of concept that after radical resection, the presence of small foci of transformation embedded within grade II tumor may be treated with close radiologic surveillance rather than immediate adjuvant therapy.

AB BACKGROUND: Endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery (ETPS) has become increasingly popular for resection of pituitary tumors, whereas microscopic transsphenoidal surgery (MTPS) also remains a commonly used approach. The economic sustainability of new techniques and technologies is rarely evaluated in the neurosurgical skull base literature. The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of ETPS compared with MTPS.
   METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to conduct a cost-utility analysis of ETPS versus MTPS from a single-payer health care perspective. Data were obtained from previously published outcomes studies. Costs were based on Medicare reimbursement rates, considering covariates such as complications, length of stay, and operative time. The base case adopted a 2-year follow-up period. Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were conducted.
   RESULTS: On average, ETPS costs $143 less and generates 0.014 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with MTPS over 2 years. The incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER) is -$10,214 per QALY, suggesting economic dominance. The QALY benefit increased to 0.105 when modeled to 10 years, suggesting that ETPS becomes even more favorable over time.
   CONCLUSIONS: ETPS appears to be cost-effective when compared with MTPS because the ICER falls below the commonly accepted $50,000 per QALY benchmark. Model limitations and assumptions affect the generalizability of the conclusion; however, ongoing efforts to improve rhinologic morbidity related to ETPS would appear to further augment the marginal cost savings and QALYs gained. Further research on the cost-effectiveness of ETPS using prospective data is warranted.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze the surgical and oncologic treatment of a Brazilian cohort of patients with grade II and III meningioma at a follow-up time of 15 years to get an overview of these patients' outcomes.
   METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 43 patients (26 women, 17 men; age range 20 to 83 years; average 57.72 +/- 14.54) operated on from 2000 to 2014 at a single institution, with the neuropathologic diagnosis of meningioma grade II (39 patients) and grade III (4 patients).
   RESULTS: Radiotherapy: 24 patients (55.81%) underwent radiotherapy; the time between the surgical procedure and the beginning of radiotherapy was 5 months; 7 patients with a diagnosis of AM underwent a new surgical procedure, albeit of adjuvant therapy, because of tumor recurrence, and only 3 of them underwent radiotherapy after the first resection. Mortality: in total, 19 deaths (44.18%) were identified in this sample: 15 (38.46%) with GII and 4 (100%) with GIII. The 10-year survival was expected in 35% of GII patients and 0% of GIII patients.
   CONCLUSION: Surgery is still the main form of treatment and the mainstay for prolonging survival. Radiotherapy is still controversial; however, we observed its positive impact on recurrence and progression-free survival.

AB OBJECTIVE: Intraoperative digital subtraction angiography (ioDSA) is touted as the gold standard imaging evaluation for aneurysm clip constructs. Candid evaluations of its limitations are sparse.
   METHODS: A prospectively collected hospital billing database was queried to identify craniotomies for aneurysm clipping from January 2010 to December 2013. We evaluated the rate of occult residual and parent vessel stenosis determined on follow-up angiography for patients undergoing ioDSA and those not undergoing ioDSA. Comparisons were performed via Fisher exact test, with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant.
   RESULTS: From our database search, we found 187 patients who underwent ioDSA after aneurysm clipping and an additional 91 patients who did not. Results from ioDSA influenced operative management in 17% of cases. Sixtyfour patients with 70 treated aneurysms undergoing ioDSA had postoperative angiography; 7 occult residuals were discovered, yielding a 10% false-negative rate, with 10% of aneurysms showing residual. Occult residuals at the middle cerebral artery bifurcation represented most discovered residuals (6/7). Thirty-two patients with 37 treated aneurysms did not undergo ioDSA and had angiographic follow-up; 24% of patients were found to have residual aneurysms (P = 0.08 compared with patients undergoing ioDSA). Residuals at the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) represented 56% of all residuals, whereas the ACoA represented only 18% of aneurysms clipped. The rate of residuals was significantly higher than that for patients with clipped ACoA aneurysms undergoing ioDSA (P = 0.008).
   CONCLUSIONS: ioDSA influenced management in nearly one fifth of cases. It can be particularly beneficial in detecting residuals for ACoA aneurysms; its benefit was less apparent for middle cerebral artery aneurysms.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The parahippocampal gyrus plays an important role in the epileptogenic pathways of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy caused by hippocampal sclerosis (mTLE-HS); its resection could prevent epileptic seizures with fewer complications. This study evaluates the initial efficacy and safety of anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL), selective amygdalohipppocampectomy (SAH), and parahippocampectomy (PHC) surgical approaches in mTLE-HS.
   METHODS: A randomized comparative pilot clinical trial (2008-2011) was performed that included patients with mTLE-HS who underwent ATL, trans-T3 SAH, and trans-T3 PHC. Their sociodemographic characteristics, visual field profiles, verbal and visual memory profiles, and Engel scale outcome at baseline and at 1 and 5 years are described, using descriptive statistics along with parametric and nonparametric tests.
   RESULTS: Forty-three patients with a mean age of 35.2 years (18-56 years), 65% female, were analyzed: 14 underwent PHC, 14 ATL, and 15 SAH. The following percentages refer to those patients who were seizure free (Engel class IA) at 1-year and 5-year follow-up, respectively: 42.9% PHC, 71.4% ATL, and 60% SAH (P = 0.304); 28.6% PHC, 50% ATL, and 53.3% SAH (P = 0.353). Postoperative visual field deficits were 0% PHC, 85.7% ATL, and 46.7% SAH (P = 0.001). Verbal and/or visual memory worsening were present in 21.3% PHC, 42.8% ATL, and 33.4% SAH (P = 0.488) and preoperative and postoperative visual memory scores were significantly different in the SAH group only (P = 0.046).
   CONCLUSIONS: PHC, ALT, and SAH show a preliminary similar efficacy in short-term seizure-free rates in patients with mTLE-HS. However, PHC efficacy in the long-term decreases compared with the other surgical techniques. PHC does not produce postoperative visual field deficits.

AB BACKGROUND: The interpretation of the results of prior studies on the association of hospital teaching status with surgical outcomes is limited by selection bias. We investigated whether undergoing surgical operations in teaching hospitals is associated with improved outcomes.
   METHODS: We performed a cohort study of all patients undergoing spine and cranial operations who were registered in the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System database from 2009 to 2013. We examined the association of teaching status (defined as academic affiliation for the primary analysis) with inpatient case fatality, discharge to a facility, and length of stay (LOS). An instrumental variable analysis was used to control for unmeasured confounding and to simulate the effect of a randomized trial.
   RESULTS: During the study period, 186,483 patients underwent surgical operations that met the inclusion criteria. Instrumental variable analysis demonstrated that hospitalization in teaching hospitals was associated with higher rates of case fatality (adjusted difference, 25%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4%-46%), discharge to a facility (adjusted difference, 5.7%; 95% CI, 4.5%-7.0%), and longer LOS (adjusted difference, 31.4%; 95% CI, 16.0%-46.1%) in comparison with nonteaching hospitals. The same associations were present in propensity score adjusted mixed effects models. These persisted in prespecified subgroups stratified on particular operations and for different definitions of teaching hospitals.
   CONCLUSIONS: Using a comprehensive all-payer cohort of surgical patients in New York State, we identified an association of treatment in teaching hospitals with increased case fatality, rate of discharge to rehabilitation, and longer LOS. Further research into the factors contributing to superior outcomes in nonteaching institutions is warranted.

AB OBJECTIVE: Especially since the establishment of mechanical thrombectomy as part of standard stroke therapy, artificial thrombi have become important in the training of interventionalists as well as for the development and testing of devices. So far, these in vitro clots have lacked direct comparisons with ex vivo thrombi. We therefore compared the histologic appearance of dynamically produced clots with that of stroke thrombi acquired during mechanical recanalization.
   METHODS: Thrombi of 145 consecutive patients with stroke with large-vessel occlusions were histologically compared with 10 artificial clots, dynamically created from human blood and pig's blood using a Chandler loop system. Quantified FP/RBC ratios (fibrin/platelets divided by red blood cell fraction) and white blood cell (WBC) fractions were identified and compared between artificial (human and pig) and ex vivo thrombi obtained from patients with various stroke causes.
   RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the analysis of FP/RBC ratios between artificial thrombi and ex vivo thrombi (P = 0.42) or in the more precise analyses considering etiologic subgroups. Distinct differences were observed for the WBC fraction, with lower values in artificial thrombi (median, 1.34%) than in ex vivo thrombi (median, 5%) (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: The main clot components, FP and RBC, are presumably the most influential factors for clot stability and mechanical resistance. Similarities between artificially generated and ex vivo stroke clots (and when considering different stroke subgroups) support the usefulness of these artificial thrombi in the pre-evaluation of thrombus extraction devices and as appropriate training material.

AB INTRODUCTION: Myelomeningocele (MMC) is a complex neural tube defect. Few studies report the results of modern postnatal management. The goal of this study was to report the long-term outcome of a multidisciplinary approach of patients with MMC.
   METHODS: Forty-six MMCs were included. Clinical status was evaluated prospectively.
   RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 8.1 years. The level of the malformation was sacral or lower lumbar (<= L4) in 27 cases, higher lumbar (between L1 and L3) in 5 cases, and thoracic in 14 cases. A Chiari II malformation was present at birth in 78.3% of the cases. Seventy-six percent of the patients were operated on within the first 24 hours of life. Sixty-one percent needed a cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedure. Seven patients underwent a second surgery for a retethering of the spine. Eighty percent presented with orthopedic problems. Sixty-five percent of our patients were able to walk. Only 13% of patients had a normal urinary elimination. Two groups of patients were identified: one group with a malformation at the level of L4 or below (group 1) and another group with a malformation strictly above L4 (group 2). Group 1 had significantly better outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: This series proves that modern multidisciplinary postnatal management of MMC is effective. In the light of these results and of the results of prenatal management of MMC, prenatal surgery seems to be a highly valuable tool to improve the outcome of patients with high lesions (level >= L3).

AB BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab (BVZ) is an antiangiogenic agent approved by the Food and Drug Administration that is used for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. Complications related to impaired healing may adversely affect patients resected for recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG) after treatment with BVZ.
   OBJECTIVE: To examine the complication rate, outcome, and tumor vasculature in patients resected for recurrent HGG after treatment with BVZ.
   METHODS: Data were reviewed retrospectively from patients undergoing surgery for recurrent HGG after treatment with BVZ. Results were compared with a control group of recurrently operated BVZ-naive HGG. Tumor samples and magnetic resonance imaging scans were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Fifteen patients underwent HGG resection after progression after BVZ. Forty-four BVZ-naive patients who underwent surgeries for tumor recurrence were included as controls. Median time from BVZ treatment to surgery was 30 days (2-107). Median overall survival from time of tumor diagnosis was 21.0 months (12-83.0), and median survival from post-BVZ surgery was 5.0 months (2.0-19.0), compared with 8.1 months in BVZ-naive controls measured from time of their last reoperation. Five of the 15 patients survived 6 or more months after post-BVZ surgery. Nine patients developed postsurgical complications requiring intervention. Complication rates for surgery after BVZ treatment were 66.7% compared with 38.6% in the control group (P = 0.077). We did not see overt changes in histopathology or immunohistochemistry staining; however, tumor vasculature in tumors resected after treatment with BVZ showed a significant decrease in mean vessel density.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgery for recurrent HGG may be feasible in a select group of patients. Mean tumor vessel density may be decreased after treatment with BVZ.

AB BACKGROUND: With the aging of our society comes a rising number of elderly patients with progressive degeneration of the spine associated with synovial cysts. Surgical treatment may be particularly challenging in elderly patients because of comorbidities.
   METHODS: Patients treated in our department between 1999 and 2014 for spinal synovial cysts were screened. The 28 patients >= 75 years old were classified as elderly and were compared with 96 patients 50-74 years old. No patient underwent fusion as part of cyst resection.
   RESULTS: Despite a significantly higher frequency of muscle reflex changes in elderly patients at presentation, symptoms, cyst levels, rate of complications, and surgical method were not different between groups. Cyst adherence to the dura and subtotal resection were observed significantly more often in the elderly group (18% vs. 3%; P < 0.05). Outcome according to the Oswestry Disability Index was classified as no disability or minimal disability in 85% of the elderly group and in 82% of the control group. Recurrent cyst and delayed fusion rates were lower in the elderly group (4% and 4%) compared with the control group (7% and 8%).
   CONCLUSIONS: The clinical course of elderly patients with surgical treatment of spinal synovial cysts did not differ compared with younger patients. Good or excellent results could be achieved and persisted for a long time in most cases. Fusion should be performed only in cases of severe instability. Nonaggressive cyst removal in cases of dural attachment enables low cerebrospinal fluid fistula rates without increasing cyst recurrence rates.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) provides an excellent anatomic characterization of cerebral vasculature, but hemodynamic assessment is often qualitative and subjective. Various clinical algorithms have been produced to semiquantify flow from the data obtained from DSA, but few have tested them against reliable flow values.
   METHODS: An arched flow model was created and injected with contrast material. Seventeen injections were acquired in anterior-posterior and lateral DSA projections, and 4 injections were acquired in oblique projection. Image intensity change over the angiogram cycle of each DSA run was analyzed through a custom MATLAB code. Time-density plots obtained were divided into 3 components (timeedensity times, TDTs): TDT10%-100% (time needed for contrast material to change image intensity from 10% to 100%), TDT100%-10% (time needed for contrast material to change image intensity from 100% to 10%), and TDT25%-25% (time needed for contrast material to change from 25% image intensity to 25%). Time-density index (TDI) was defined as model cross-sectional area to TDT ratio, and it was measured against different flow rates.
   RESULTS: TDI10%-100%, TDI100%-10%, and TDI25%-25% all correlated significantly with flow (P < 0.001). TDI10%-100%, TDI100%-10%, and TDI25%-25% showed, respectively, a correlation coefficient of 0.91, 0.91, and 0.97 in the anteriore-posterior DSA projections (P < 0.001). In the lateral DSA projection, TDI100%-10% showed a weaker correlation (r = 0.57; P = 0.03). Also in the oblique DSA projection, TDIs correlated significantly with flow.
   CONCLUSIONS: TDI on DSA correlates significantly with flow. Although in vitro studies might overlook conditions that occur in patients, this method appears to correlate with the flow and could offer a semiquantitative method to evaluate the cerebral blood flow.

   RISK-FACTORS; ARUBA; HEMORRHAGE; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Recent literature strongly challenged indications to perform preventive surgery in unruptured arteriovenous malformation (AVM) claiming that invasive AVM treatment is associated with a significant risk of complications and thus conservative management may be a preferable alternative in many patients. On the other hand, the recent improvement of surgical instrumentation and treatment strategies (both surgical and interventional) yielded better outcomes than those achieved only a decade ago. Therefore, even among specialists, a wide variety of opinions, concerning the treatment of unruptured AVM, can be found.
   METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study analyzes a consecutive series of 545 surgically treated AVMs in 10 different hospitals in Italy.
   RESULTS: Patients with AVMs treated after hemorrhage had an unfavorable (modified Rankin Scale score >1) outcome in more than one third (37.69%) of the cases. Conversely, with proper indications, unruptured AVMs treated preventively have a good outcome in 93.8% of cases, increasing to 95.7%, with no death, if only Spetzler-Martin grades 1-3 are considered (P < 0.05).
   Outcomes on discharge significantly (P < 0.05) improve at 6 months with the disappearance of many of the initial neurologic deficits that turn out to be transient.
   CONCLUSIONS: In unruptured low-risk AVMs (Spetzler-Martin grades 1-3), over time, the risk of surgery-associated neurologic deficits becomes lower than that linked to spontaneous hemorrhage, with a crossover point at 6.5 years. Because the average bleeding age is less than 45 years, preventive surgery can be advocated to safeguard the patient and overcome the risks associated with the natural history of AVMs.

AB OBJECTIVE: To summarize therapeutic efficacy of modified pial synangiosis in children with moyamoya disease and our experience with this method.
   METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to analyze clinical efficacy of modified pial synangiosis in children with moyamoya disease who were treated between October 2002 and August 2015 at our center. Clinical characteristics of these rare cases were summarized, and surgical efficacy was assessed based on longterm follow-up results.
   RESULTS: We employed modified pial synangiosis to treat 10 children with moyamoya disease; 18 modified pial synangiosis procedures were performed. The study included 2 boys and 8 girls (mean age at disease onset, 6.5 years +/- 2.6). According to preoperative digital subtraction angiography, Suzuki grade III was noted in 80% (16/20) of hemispheres, and Suzuki grade II was noted in the remaining hemispheres (4/20). Mean follow-up period was 63.4 months +/- 36.0. During the follow-up period, 2 cases of transient ischemic attack were reported. The remaining patients had no evidence of cerebral ischemia, seizures, or cerebral hemorrhage. Postoperative assessments based on Matsushima classification scores showed that patients with grade A revascularization accounted for 66.7% (12/18) of treated hemispheres, patients with grade B accounted for 27.8% (5/18), and patients with grade C accounted for 5.6% (1/18).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our clinical findings provide data on efficacy and safety of modified pial synangiosis, but analysis of more cases is necessary to draw solid conclusions. A randomized controlled study is required to verify improved surgical efficacy of modified pial synangiosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Midline shift (MLS) has been a known predictor for prognosis after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), whereas it is secondary to lateral ventricular compression. In this study, we investigated whether lateral ventricular volume (LVV) asymmetry caused by ventricular compression was independently associated with poor outcome of ICH.
   METHODS: We retrospectively studied clinical patients with spontaneous ICH from January 2010 to January 2017. LVV was calculated using slicer software. LVV ratio (LVR) was then determined to quantitatively evaluate LVV asymmetry, and its relationship with poor outcome was tested by logistic regression model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to identify the optimized baseline LVR cutoff point to predict poor outcome.
   RESULTS: 188 patients were included, of whom 41% (77/188) experienced a poor outcome. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified baseline LVR as an independent predictor for poor outcome after ICH. The predictive value of baseline LVR was confirmed by ROC analysis (area under the curve [0.742; P < 0.001). The optimized baseline LVR cutoff point was 3.7, with a sensitivity of 64.9% and specificity of 80.2%. Using LVR >3.7 as an exposure factor yielded an odds ratio of 7.49 (P < 0.001), and a risk ratio of 2.98 (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: LVV asymmetry was associated with clinical prognosis after ICH, and high LVR (>3.7) might independently predict poor outcome.

AB BACKGROUND: Postoperative central nervous system infections (PCNSIs) are serious complications following neurosurgical intervention. We previously investigated the incidence and causative pathogens of PCNSIs at a resource-limited, neurosurgical center in south Asia. This follow-up study was conducted to analyze differences in PCNSIs at the same institution following only one apparent change: the operating room air filtration system.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective study of all neurosurgical cases performed between December 1, 2013, and March 31, 2016 at our center. Providers, patient demographic data, case types, perioperative care, rate of PCNSI, and rates of other complications were reviewed. These results were then compared with the findings of our previous study of neurosurgical cases between June 1, 2012, and June 30, 2013.
   RESULTS: All 623 neurosurgical operative cases over the study period were reviewed. Four patients (0.6%) had a PCNSI, and no patients had a positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture. In the previous study, among 363 cases, 71 patients (19.6%) had a PCNSI and 7 (1.9%) had a positive CSF culture (all Gram-negative organisms). The differences in both parameters are statistically significant (P < 0.001). Between the 2 studies, there was no change in treatment providers, case types, case durations, antibiotic administration practices, and patient demographics.
   CONCLUSIONS: The rates of PCNSI and positive CSF culture were significantly lower in our present cohort compared with the cohort in our previous study. The sole apparent change involves the air filtration system inside the neurosurgical operating rooms; this environmental change occurred during the 5 months between the 2 studies. This study demonstrates the impact of environmental factors in reducing infections.

AB OBJECTIVE: Surgery in patients with highly eloquent glioblastoma (GB) remains challenging. The aim of this study was to evaluate influence of use of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) on extent of resection (EOR), clinical outcome, and survival in patients with pre-operatively intended subtotal resection of GB.
   METHODS: Retrospective assessment was performed in 3 neurosurgical centers (2008-2013). All patients with primary GB, unilocular growth, and adjuvant radiochemotherapy in whom subtotal resection was intended were included. Imaging data were pseudonymized and volumetrically assessed by a central reviewer. Clinical outcome was evaluated based on complications, new permanent neurologic deficits, and survival. Based on subtraction of potential EOR (as defined by reviewer) from effective EOR, EOR change (Delta EOR) was calculated for each case. We calculated multivariate linear regressions to assess influence on effective EOR and Delta EOR, binary regressions to assess influence on complications and new permanent neurologic deficits, and Cox regression models to assess survival.
   RESULTS: Assessment included 70 patients. In iMRI group, a significantly lower Delta EOR (4% vs. 22%, P = 0.008) was found. In linear regression model controlling for age, tumor volume, neurophysiologic mapping, and iMRI, only iMRI influenced Delta EOR significantly (P = 0.03, odds ratio 0.27). In binary regression model controlling for age, tumor volume, effective EOR, neurophysiologic mapping, and iMRI, none of the variables showed a significant difference concerning complications and new permanent neurologic deficits. Overall survival was significantly influenced by age (P = 0.03, odds ratio 1.02) and iMRI (P = 0.026, odds ratio 0.51).
   CONCLUSIONS: Maximum safe resection is an important prognostic factor for patients with eloquent GBs. iMRI seems to be a relevant tool to achieve this goal.

AB BACKGROUND: In some fluoroscopy machines, the dose-rate output of the fluoroscope is tied to a selectable patient size. Although patient size may play a significant role in visceral or cardiac procedures, head morphology is less variable, and high dose outputs may not be necessary even in very obese patients. We hypothesized that very small patient size setting can be used to reduce dose for cerebral angiography without compromising image quality.
   METHODS: Patients who underwent endovascular neurosurgical procedures during the 2015-2016 academic year were identified, and estimated procedural air kerma (AK) was tabulated retrospectively. Technologists were instructed to begin using the very small patient size setting for all procedures performed using our Philips Allura Xper FD20 biplane fluoroscopy system beginning in March 2016. No changes were made in a second procedure room using a Toshiba Infinix system. Student t tests and logistic regression models were used to compare radiation exposure before and after March 1, 2016, for both machines.
   RESULTS: For diagnostic cerebral angiograms performed on the Philips system (n = 302), AK was reduced by approximately 17% (1277 vs. 1061 mGy; P = 0.0006.) Changes in table height, total fluoroscopy time, patient weight, and body mass index did not contribute to this difference. No significant change was seen in total AK using the Toshiba system (n = 237). Blinded review by a neuroradiologist did not demonstrate any change in image quality.
   CONCLUSIONS: Using the very small patient size reduces fluoroscopy dose by 17% for cerebral angiography without impacting image quality.

TI Transtentorial Distortion Syndrome: Consistent Complication Following
   Lateral and Fourth Ventricular Shunting in Adults

DT Article
DE Cerebrospinal fluid; Cranial nerve palsy; Fourth ventricle;
   Hydrocephalus; Ventriculoperitoneal shunt
ID NERVE PALSIES; FACIAL-NERVE; 4TH-VENTRICLE
AB BACKGROUND: Complex hydrocephalus affecting lateral and fourth ventricles separately is occasionally managed with cerebrospinal fluid diversion via supratentorial and infratentorial ventricular catheters. The optimal configuration to reduce complications is currently unknown in adults. We describe a consistently similar clinical presentation of patients with complex hydrocephalus and a fourth ventricle separately drained by infratentorial shunt insertion.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective single-center case series. Medical notes were reviewed for clinical presentation, brain imaging, and neurophysiologic tests results. All patients underwent intracranial pressure monitoring (ICPM). Outcomes were determined by ventricular appearance on brain imaging computed tomography and symptomatic improvements postoperatively.
   RESULTS: Five adult patients referred to the hydrocephalus service had separate infratentorial and supratentorial shunt systems. A common clinical presentation was observed, including lower motor neuron facial palsy (confirmed with electrophysiology), ophthalmoplegia, dysarthria, impaired gait headache, and nausea. We refer to this as transtentorial distortion syndrome. Twenty-four-hour ICPM demonstrated clear low pressures. All patients underwent shunt revision connecting the transtentorial shunts via a Y-connector and the addition of a distal valve. All subjects had improved ventricular appearance on computed tomography scans post revision, and normalization of ICPM was observed. In the follow-up period of 6 months, no patient required further shunt revision.
   CONCLUSION: To prevent transtentorial distortion syndrome, supratentorial and infratentorial shunt constructs in adults with encysted fourth ventricles should be similar to the shunt systems widely known in the pediatric population with Dandy-Walker syndrome (i.e., joint output to a single valve distal to the connection of the 2 proximal drainage catheters).

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In-stent restenosis (ISR) remains a challenge for vertebrobasilar artery stenting (VBAS). We aimed to investigate the incidence and risk factors of ISR.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective study. From July 28, 2005, to July 30, 2015, patients who received VBAS with an angiographic follow-up time of 6 to 12 months after surgery were enrolled. The clinical and angiographic issues were recorded and analyzed.
   RESULTS: In total, 283 patients with 335 stents were incorporated into the study. Vertebral ostial lesions accounted for 73.4% (246/335) of the lesions. During the follow-up period, 58 patients with 60 stents experienced ISR (>50%). Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that the degree of residual stenosis, stent diameter, and alcohol consumption were independent predictors of ISR.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the incidence and risk factors of ISR after VBAS. This retrospective study with the largest cohort to date provided insight into the occurrence of ISR after VBAS.

AB OBJECTIVE: Surgery for syringomyelia generally aims to treat the underlying cause, if it is known. Optimal management is unclear for idiopathic syringomyelia, or when treatment of the putative cause has failed or is high risk. Syrinx to subarachnoid shunting is an option for these cases; a series is reported to assess the outcomes of this approach.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and radiologic features of a consecutive series of patients with syringomyelia treated with syrinx to subarachnoid shunting.
   RESULTS: Forty-one patients (19 male, 4e79 years old) were treated from 2000 to 2016, including 15 patients with idiopathic syringomyelia, 13 with spinal trauma, 5 with Chiari malformation, 4 with arachnoiditis, 3 with tethered cord, and 1 with arachnoid bands. The patients were treated with a syrinx to subarachnoid shunt, and a subset also underwent expansile duraplasty. At follow-up (3e108 months, mean 36 months) syrinx size was reduced in 37 patients, and there was improvement or stabilization of symptoms in all but 1 patient. Three patients had temporary lower limb sensory symptoms after surgery. Other complications were 2 transient cerebrospinal fluid leaks, a pseudomeningocoele, and 1 postoperative myocardial infarction. Two cases of shunt dislodgement required reoperation, and a third case required early reoperation for an enlarging syrinx. There were no cases of shunt blockage or infection.
   CONCLUSIONS: Syrinx to subarachnoid shunting is a safe and effective treatment for idiopathic syringomyelia and for patients who are not suitable for, or have not responded to, other treatment.

   IMMUNIZATION; ERA
AB BACKGROUND: In previous studies of pneumococcal meningitis in adults within general hospitals or national cohorts, the most common predisposing conditions were otitis media, sinusitis, pneumonia, immunosuppression, alcoholism, and diabetes. The epidemiology of pneumococcal meningitis is changing because of the use of vaccines in childhood, and antibiotic resistance has increased.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of patients with diagnoses of pneumococcal meningitis proved by an inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a positive culture, treated during a period of 14 years at an adult neurosurgical neurologic referral center. Our aim was to define their clinical course, predisposing conditions, antimicrobial susceptibilities, and outcome.
   RESULTS: We reviewed the cases of 30 patients, 17 men and 13 women, with a mean age of 36.7 years. Fourteen patients (46.6%) had previous neurosurgery, 12 patients (40%) had CSF fistula, 8 had remote head trauma, and 8 also presented recurrent meningitis. Resistance to ceftriaxone or vancomycin was less than 5%, and penicillin resistance was 53%. Eight patients (26.7%) had died. An increased risk of death was associated with coma at admission, septic shock, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, mechanical ventilation, thrombocytopenia, and a low CSF opening pressure.
   CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that patients with pneumococcal meningitis treated at neurosurgical neurologic centers have different predisposing conditions with severe disease and high mortality, thus prompting us to recommend aggressive pneumococcal vaccination in patients with CSF leaks and severe head trauma. Prospective studies to identify which neurosurgical patients may benefit in the long term from a pneumococcal vaccine are urgently needed.

AB BACKGROUND: Preoperative recognition of the anatomic individualities of each patient can help to achieve more precise and less invasive approaches. It also may help to anticipate potential complications and intra-operative difficulties. Here we describe the use, accuracy, and precision of a free tool for planning microsurgical approaches using 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   METHODS: We used the 3D volume rendering tool of a free open-source software program for 3D reconstruction of images of surgical sites obtained by MRI volumetric acquisition. We recorded anatomic reference points, such as the sulcus and gyrus, and vascularization patterns for intraoperative localization of lesions. Lesion locations were confirmed during surgery by intraoperative ultrasound and/or electrocorticography and later by postoperative MRI.
   RESULTS: Between August 2015 and September 2016, a total of 23 surgeries were performed using this technique for 9 low-grade gliomas, 7 high-grade gliomas, 4 cortical dysplasias, and 3 arteriovenous malformations. The technique helped delineate lesions with an overall accuracy of 2.6 +/- 1.0 mm. 3D reconstructions were successfully performed in all patients, and images showed sulcus, gyrus, and venous patterns corresponding to the intraoperative images. All lesion areas were confirmed both intraoperatively and at the postoperative evaluation.
   CONCLUSIONS: With the technique described herein, it was possible to successfully perform 3D reconstruction of the cortical surface. This reconstruction tool may serve as an adjunct to neuronavigation systems or may be used alone when such a system is unavailable.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of direct oral anti-coagulants (DOACs) compared with warfarin on the 30-day readmission rates in patients with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients fromour hospital's trauma database admitted between June 2011 and October 2015 to our level II trauma center after sustaining a traumatic ICH while receiving anticoagulant therapy. Patients were stratified based on the anticoagulation drug (DOAC or warfarin) prescribed on admission. The readmission rates between the 2 groups were compared using chi(2) analysis and multivariate logistic regression. Patients who died during their initial admission were excluded.
   RESULTS: Over the 4-year period, 160 patients were admitted with traumatic ICH. Seventy-nine were receiving warfarin and 57 were receiving a DOAC at admission. Data collected included age, sex, injury severity score, admission Glasgow Coma Score, Abbreviated Injury Scale (head), mechanism of injury, hospital and intensive care unit lengths of stay, discharge destination (eg, home, rehabilitation facility, nursing facility), comorbidities, operative interventions, readmissions, and reasons for the readmissions. The rate of readmission for rebleeding of ICH was significantly lower in the DOAC group compared with the warfarin group (5.3% vs. 17.7%; P = 0.04). Multivariate logistic regression suggests that warfarin use, but not DOAC use, is associated with increased readmission both for all causes and for ICH rebleeding.
   CONCLUSIONS: Warfarin use is associated with higher readmission rates in patients with intracranial bleeding for both all-cause readmissions and for intracranial rebleeding.

AB OBJECTIVE: Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) occurs at any spinal level, but the clinical characteristics of lumbosacral DAVF have not been well documented. The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical characteristics of lumbosacral DAVF and compare these features with those in thoracic DAVF.
   METHODS: Twenty-five consecutive patients with 16 thoracic and 9 lumbosacral DAVFs were included (mean age, 63.9 years; 20 men). All patients presented with progressive myelopathy. Preoperative and postoperative neurologic deficits were compared between thoracic and lumbosacral DAVF groups. Using magnetic resonance imaging, the extent of T2 high-intensity areas and signal flow voids were documented. Follow-up after surgical interventions ranged from 6 to 96 months (mean, 38.1 months).
   RESULTS: Preoperatively, patients suffering lumbosacral DAVF tended to be more severely disabled compared with thoracic DAVF patients. Lumbosacral DAVF patients exhibited diminished patellar (P = 0.04) and Achilles tendon reflexes (P < 0.01), while most thoracic DAVF patients exhibited hyperreflexia. In magnetic resonance imaging, signal flow voids around the spinal cord were evident in only 4 of 9 lumbosacral DAVF patients (P = 0.012). Rather, a serpentine signal flow void of the filum terminale was a hallmark of lumbosacral DAVFs to distinguish them from thoracic DAVFs. In the lumbosacral DAVF group, postoperative improvements were significantly better in micturition function (P = 0.02).
   CONCLUSIONS: In lumbosacral DAVF, postoperative micturition function recovery was superior to thoracic DAVF. Intradural lumbar signal flow void is indicative of lumbosacral DAVF. For appropriate management, it is important to recognize these differences between lumbosacral and thoracic DAVF.

AB BACKGROUND: Parasagittal meningiomas arise from the arachnoid cells of the angle formed between the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and the brain convexity. In this retrospective study, we focused on factors that predict early recurrence and recurrence times.
   METHODS: We reviewed 125 patients with parasagittal meningiomas operated from 1985 to 2014. We studied the following variables: age, sex, location, laterality, histology, surgeons, invasion of the SSS, Simpson removal grade, follow-up time, angiography, embolization, radiotherapy, recurrence and recurrence time, reoperation, neurologic deficit, degree of dependency, and patient status at the end of follow-up.
   RESULTS: Patients ranged in age from 26 to 81 years (mean 57.86 years; median 60 years). There were 44 men (35.2%) and 81 women (64.8%). There were 57 patients with neurologic deficits (45.2%). The most common presenting symptom was motor deficit. World Health Organization grade I tumors were identified in 104 patients (84.6%), and the majority were the meningothelial type. Recurrence was detected in 34 cases. Time of recurrence was 9 to 336 months (mean: 84.4 months; median: 79.5 months). Male sex was identified as an independent risk for recurrence with relative risk 2.7 (95% confidence interval 1.21-6.15), P = 0.014. Kaplan-Meier curves for recurrence had statistically significant differences depending on sex, age, histologic type, and World Health Organization histologic grade. A binary logistic regression was made with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test with P > 0.05; sex, tumor size, and histologic type were used in this model.
   CONCLUSIONS: Male sex is an independent risk factor for recurrence that, associated with other factors such tumor size and histologic type, explains 74.5% of all cases in a binary regression model.

AB OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study reports the epidemiology, clinical aspects, and management of spinal trauma in children and adolescents.
   METHODS: Multicenter study of 215 cases of spinal trauma in individuals <18 years of age. All patients were submitted to preoperative and postoperative radiologic and clinical evaluation. The fractures were classified according to the AOSpine fracture classification. Neurological evaluation was performed using the Frankel scale at admission to hospital and at the last follow-up.
   RESULTS: Mean age was 14.7 (+/- 2.5) years and most of the patients were male (72.6%). Falls were responsible for 52.6% of the spinal trauma. Compression fracture was the most common type of fracture, observed in 48.4% of the cases. Most spinal fractures were located at the thoracic level (58.7%). Associated injuries were observed in 37.2% of the cases. The complication rates were 15.8%. Normal neurological examination was observed in 160 cases (74.4%) at the final follow-up. Neurological impairment was mostly observed due to shallow water diving, dislocation fractures types, and fractures located between the lower cervical spine and the thoracic spine. Surgical treatment was performed in 73.8% of the cases. Better neurological outcome was observed in fractures due to falls, fractures located in the upper cervical (C1-C2) and lower lumbar spine injuries (L3-L5).
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment is often necessary in children and adolescents after spinal trauma. Higher incidence of spinal cord injury was observed after shallow water diving, fractures located in the lower cervical spine and thoracic spine, and type B and C fractures.

   RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; INFARCTION; EMBOLISM; THERAPY; DEVICE;
   REVASCULARIZATION; HYPOPERFUSION
AB BACKGROUND: Endovascular treatment (EVT) is an effective therapy for acute ischemic stroke due to large artery occlusion of the anterior circulation. Yet some patients do not experience clinical improvement despite successful recanalization and reperfusion. The reasons are unknown, but one possible explanation is microvessel obstruction downstream. The aim of this study was to assess the presence of microembolic signals (MES) with transcranial Doppler and define their role as predictors of clinical outcome in stroke patients after EVT.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 40 consecutive patients (23 men, mean age 65.8 +/- 7.6 years) with an acute ischemic stroke caused by large artery occlusion of the anterior circulation who underwent EVT. Presence and rate of MES were assessed by 60-minute transcranial Doppler monitoring at the end of the procedure and after 15 days from stroke onset.
   RESULTS: MES were detected in 65% (26/40) of patients after EVT. Ipsilateral carotid occlusion (P = 0.05), >= 50% ipsilateral carotid stenosis (P = 0.05), incomplete recanalization (P = 0.03), and inadequate collaterals (P = 0.04) were associated with a significantly higher MES count, which was correlated with a worse functional prognosis (P = 0.03), higher mortality (P = 0.02), higher distal embolization burden even outside the original ischemic territory (P = 0.02), and higher risk of cardiovascular events (P = 0.04).
   CONCLUSIONS: MES monitoring in stroke patients after EVT provides useful prognostic information, sheds light on the lack of clinical improvement despite successful recanalization, and might guide medical treatment in higher risk patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the clinical utility of the buccal fat pad flap (BFPF) for closing a variety of skull base defects.
   METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 5 consecutive patients who underwent endoscopic cranial base surgery with endoscopic harvest of BFPF pedicled along the internal maxillary artery for reconstruction of the skull base between October 2013 and November 2014.
   RESULTS: All 5 patients had complete take of the BFPFs with mucosalization on postoperative follow-up with no reported complications or cerebrospinal fluid leak.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on the application of endoscopic BFPF. Our experience suggests that this recently described flap is viable and a useful addition to the armamentarium of the skull base surgeon.

AB BACKGROUND: The Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need tool (SOSAS) was created to evaluate the burden of surgically treatable conditions in low-and middle-income countries. The goal of our study is to describe the face, head, and neck (FHN) conditions that need surgical care in Uganda, along with barriers to that care and disability from these conditions.
   METHODS: A 2-stage cluster randomized SOSAS survey was administered in a cross-sectional manner between August and September 2014. Participants included randomly selected persons in 105 enumeration areas in 74 districts throughout Uganda with 24 households in each cluster. The SOSAS survey collected demographic and clinical data on all respondents. Univariate and multivariate logistic models evaluated associations of demographic characteristics and clinical characteristics of the FHN conditions and outcomes of whether health care was sought or surgical care was received.
   RESULTS: Of the 4428 respondents, 331 (7.8%) reported having FHN conditions. The most common types of conditions were injury-related wounds. Of those who reported an FHN condition, 36% reported receiving no surgical care whereas 82.5% reported seeking health care. In the multivariate model, literacy and type of condition were significant predictors of seeking health care whereas village type, literacy, and type of condition remained significant predictors of receiving surgical care.
   CONCLUSIONS: Many individuals in Uganda are not receiving surgical care and barriers include costs, rural residency, and literacy. Our study highlights the need for targeted interventions in various parts of Uganda to increase human resources for surgery and expand surgical capacity.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess effectiveness of Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKRS) in improving quality of life (QoL) in patients with idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (TN).
   METHODS: Between January 2001 and October 2013, 166 patients with medically resistant TN were treated at our institution with GKRS. Patients were divided into 2 groups: patients with typical TN (TTN) and patients with atypical TN (ATN).
   All patients underwent clinical evaluation using Marseille and Barrow Neurological Institute pain and numbness scales; in addition, they completed the Short-Form 36 Health Survey, Activities of Daily Living, and Excellent Good Fair Poor questionnaires and underwent psychological and neurologic examination.
   RESULTS: Mean follow-up time was 64.7 months. All Short-Form 36 domains were significantly improved in both groups after treatment, with an evident trend to reach the median values of healthy Italian population. Mean postoperative Activities of Daily Living score in the TTN group and ATN group were 5.8 and 5.4, respectively, and Karnofsky Performance Status increased to 94.2 and 86.4, respectively.
   Pain recurrence negatively affected patients' QoL and psychofunctional performance without reaching statistical significance. At the last follow-up, 73% of patients were clustered in the pain-relief group.
   CONCLUSIONS: GKRS significantly improves QoL and functional and psychosocial performance of patients with idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. A trend was observed toward a more favorable outcome in patients with TTN, compared with patients with ATN, without reaching a statistically significant distinction.

AB BACKGROUND: No study to date has established how commonly spontaneous fusion occurs after stand-alone percutaneous pedicle screw fixation in adult population. In this retrospective single-center study, we investigated the effectiveness, long-term solidity and safety of stand-alone percutaneous pedicle screw fixation without in situ fusion and the influence of presence or absence of fusion on the clinical outcome of patients with low-grade lumbar segmental instability.
   METHODS: Eighty-eight patients with symptomatic low-grade spondylolisthesis were treated with posterior stand-alone percutaneous pedicle screw fixation without bone graft. Radiographic evaluation was used to determine if spontaneous fusion or absence of fusion was present. The solid fusion and absence of fusion groups were analyzed clinically (visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index) and with a validated self-administered questionnaire.
   RESULTS: The average duration of follow-up was 70.5 months (range, 48-120 months). Radiologic signs of spontaneous fusion were present in 45.5% of the cohort and absent in 54.5%. Clinical outcome was excellent to good in 73.8% of the cohort (in 70.9% of cases with spontaneous fusion and in 67.5% of cases with absence of fusion). No significant differences in visual analog scale scores for residual back and lower limb pain between the 2 groups were seen at the final follow-up. At the final follow-up, 5 of 88 patients (5.6%) underwent revision surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous pedicle screw fixation offers several advantages that help minimize approach-related morbidity, while achieving similar clinical outcome as seen with more traditional invasive procedures. A solid fixation without bone graft provides long-term clinical benefits. In our patients, the appearance of a spontaneous solid fusion and the absence of fusion after stand-alone pedicle screw fixation were correlated with similar improved clinical outcomes at long-term follow-up.

AB OBJECTIVE: The management issues of 15 cases of giant and dumbbell-shaped facial neurinomas that extended both in the middle and posterior cranial fossa are reported.
   MATERIAL AND METHODS: During the period 2002 to June 2017, we surgically treated 15 cases of giant and dumbbell shaped facial neurinomas: 10 males and 5 females ranging from 17-59 years (average 34.2 years). Average duration of facial nerve weakness before seeking surgical relief was 49.46 months. Fourteen patients had varying degrees of hearing disturbance. Seven patients had ataxia. The sizes of the tumor ranged from 5.2-8 cm (average being 6.2 cm). The tumors were in an "interdural" location, both in the middle and in the posterior cranial fossa. An extradural subtemporal "interdural" approach was used to resect the tumor in both compartments. The dural cover of the tumor provided a well-defined surgical plane of dissection. Tumor recurrence was observed in 3 cases. The tumor was interdural even at the time of recurrence.
   CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the fact that the facial nerve neurinomas are interdural in nature and soft and necrotic in character can allow quick and safe surgery with a relatively small surgical exposure.

AB OBJECTIVE: The authors report their successful experience of treating 14 cases of pial arteriovenous fistula (PAVF) by direct surgery.
   METHODS: During the period January 2010 to April 2017, 14 patients with PAVF were treated by surgery. Only those patients were selected who had a single arterial feeding channel. There were 9 male patients and 5 female patients, and their ages ranged from 5 to 53 years (average, 19 years). Ten patients were younger than 20 years of age. Five patients presented clinical and radiologic features that suggested hemorrhage from the PAVF. Ten patients had seizures. Two patients had hemispheric symptoms or neurologic deficits at the time of presentation. In 12 patients, there were no gross neurologic deficits. The diagnosis was made on the basis of digital subtraction angiography in all patients and computed tomographic angiography in 8 patients. Angiography revealed that the PAVFs in 8 patients were supplied by the middle cerebral artery, in 5 patients by the anterior cerebral artery, and in 1 patient by branches of the basilar artery. Surgical procedures involved identification of the site of fistula, obliteration of the feeding artery, and resection of the entire venous varix.
   RESULTS: The PAVF was successfully excluded from circulation in all patients. There were no neurologic deficits related to the surgical procedure.
   CONCLUSIONS: Direct surgical resection of the entire PAVF is a safe, effective, and probably curative method of treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite significant improvement in clinical care, operative strategies, and technology, neurosurgery is still risky, and optimal preoperative planning and anatomical assessment are necessary to minimize the risks of serious complications. Our purpose was to document the dural venous sinuses (DVS) and their variations identified during routine 3-dimensional (3D) venography created through 3D models for the teaching of complex cerebral anatomy.
   METHODS: 3D models of the DVS networks were printed. Compared with the controls, cases with cortical venous thrombosis have altered venous anatomy, which has not been previously compared.
   RESULTS: Geometrical changes between the neighboring DVS could be easily manipulated and explored from different angles. Modeling helped to conduct the examination in detail with reference to geometrical features of DVS, degree of asymmetry, its extension, location, and presence of hypoplasia/atresia channels. Challenging DVS anatomy was exposed with models of adverse anatomical variations of the DVS network, including highly angulated, asymmetrical view, narrowed lumens, and hypoplasia and atresia structures. It assisted us in comprehending spatial anatomy configuration of life-like models.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patient-specific models of DVS geometry could provide an improved understanding of the complex brain anatomy and better navigation in difficult areas and allow surgeons to anticipate anatomical issues that might arise during the operation. Such models offer opportunities to accelerate the development of expertise with respect to new and novel procedures as well as new surgical approaches and innovations, thus allowing novice neurosurgeons to gain valuable experience in surgical techniques without exposing patients to risk of harm.

AB BACKGROUND: Headache is the main and often isolated symptom of patients with Chiari type 1 malformation (CM1). Classically described as occipital and exacerbated by cough, headaches may be poorly characterized, making it difficult to establish CM1 as the underlying cause. Current guidelines for surgical posterior fossa decompression are undefined. The challenge is to distinguish headaches related to CM1 from headaches coincidentally coexisting with CM1. We aimed to determine predictive factors of headache resolution after surgery and applied to our cohort the Chiari Severity Index, a recently developed predictive prognostic score.
   METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 49 patients with CM1 and preoperative headache. Standardized telephone interviews regarding headaches before and after surgery were conducted by the same neurologist; magnetic resonance imaging morphometric analyses were performed by an independent neuroradiologist. Headache resolution was defined as >= 50% reduction in frequency of headache days.
   RESULTS: Preoperative factors of headache resolution after multivariate analysis were attack duration <5 minutes (P = 0.001), triggering by Valsalva maneuvers (P = 0.003), severe intensity of attack (P = 0.05), occipital location (P = 0.05), and greater number of headache days per month (P = 0.04). These characteristics are part of International Headache Society diagnostic criteria for headache attributed to CM1. No radiologic predictive factor was demonstrated. Postoperative improvement was inversely correlated with Chiari Severity Index.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the relevance of International Headache Society criteria to identify headaches related to CM1. We propose their systematic use in a preoperative questionnaire.

AB PURPOSE: A retrospective study was conducted to clarify the risk factors of postoperative sacroiliac joint pain (SIJP) for posterior open lumbar surgery.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 472 patients who underwent posterior lumbar surgery between January 2011 and December 2014 were included in this analysis. We recorded basic characteristics, surgical characteristics, and SIJP information for each patient.
   RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative SIJP is 13.8% in our study. Comparison of the incidence of SIJP between diskectomy and posterior lumbar interbody fusion indicated that SIJP incidence tended to be higher in posterior lumbar interbody fusion patients (P = 0.029). Compared with the single-segment group, SIJP occurred more frequently in the multiple operative segments group (P = 0.025). Comparing the incidence of SIJP among different types of lumbar diseases, SIJP incidence is significantly higher in the lumbar stenosis group (P = 0035).
   CONCLUSION: Lumbar fusion surgery and multiple operative segments are interdependent risk factors for the postoperative SIJP. The incidence of postoperative SIJP also increases in patients with lumbar stenosis compared with lumbar disk herniation and lumbar spondylolisthesis.

   GLAND
AB BACKGROUND: Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a major complication of transsphenoidal surgery (TSS). DI usually occurs within a couple of days after TSS. Delayed occurrence of postoperative DI is rarely observed and its developing mechanisms remain unknown.
   METHODS: Six patients were identified as having postoperative delayed DI, which was defined as DI that first occurred 2 or more weeks after TSS. They consisted of 1 male and 5 females, and their mean age was 38.3 years (range, 10-76 years). Five patients were histologically diagnosed with Rathke cleft cyst (RCC), and one had RCC coexisting with prolactin-secreting adenoma. Sequential T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was evaluated for hyperintensity (HI) in the pituitary stalk and the posterior lobe, indicating the location of antidiuretic hormone.
   RESULTS: No patients had any DI before TSS. Delayed DI occurred 2 weeks to 3 months after TSS and persisted for 2 weeks to 5 months. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed that the HI in the posterior lobe became faint but did not disappear after DI occurrence, and their intensities increased with recovery from DI. In contrast, the HI in the pituitary stalk was found faintly preoperatively and turned clear postoperatively and decreased with recovery from DI. The morphologic patterns were dependent on DI duration.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the delayed occurrence of DI, it was suggested that preoperative antidiuretic hormone transport was mildly congested yet not completely blocked when DI manifested postoperatively. Gradual spreading of inflammation to the infundibulum after RCC removal was considered as 1 possible mechanism of this delayed DI development.

ID EPIDEMIOLOGY; GUIDELINES; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) is a significant global health problem disproportionately affecting low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Management of intracranial hypertension in sTBI is crucial to survival and optimal recovery. Practitioners in high-income countries routinely use intracranial pressure (ICP) monitors although their usefulness has been questioned. ICP monitors are usually unavailable in LMICs. No consensus-based/tested protocols or literature exists for sTBI treatment without ICP monitoring.
   METHODS: Investigators developed serial SurveyMonkey surveys for Latin American neurointensivists and neurosurgeons to determine current practice. These clinicians had extensive routine ongoing experience in sTBI without ICP monitoring. Surveys were administered and analyzed before/during/after a 2015 Buenos Aires consensus conference. Investigators identified areas of convergence blinded from colleagues' responses. A 47-clinician task force, representing 15 countries, who routinely manage patients with sTBI without monitors developed consensus-based treatment guidelines during a 3-day facilitated conference.
   RESULTS: Elements were added to the protocol at an 80% agreement threshold. Follow-on surveys resolved remaining elements to 97% agreement. The protocol addresses both tapering (on improvement) and neuroworsening. Staged treatment options were identified, plus unique clinical practice issues. This process introduced a research method to a large multidisciplinary group of LMIC clinicians. This report describes the process used to develop an LMIC-specific protocol that is transferable to other diseases/injuries. The protocol is being tested in 5 LMICs. -
   CONCLUSIONS: We derived consensus-based guidelines for sTBI treatment without ICP monitoring, and introduced a research method to a large multidisciplinary group of LMIC clinicians naive to such methods.

   COLUMN; FOLLOW-UP; MANAGEMENT; SURGERY; ANOMALIES
AB BACKGROUND: Cervical ribs (CR) are supernumerary ribs that arise from the seventh cervical vertebra. In the presence of CR, the boundaries of the interscalene triangle can be further constricted and result in neurovascular compression and thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). The aim of our study was to provide a comprehensive evidence-based assessment of CR prevalence and their association with TOS as well as surgical approach to excision of CR and surgical patients' characteristics.
   METHODS: A thorough search of major electronic databases was conducted to identify any relevant studies. Data on the prevalence, laterality, and side of CR were extracted from the eligible studies for both healthy individuals and patients with TOS. Data on the type of TOS and surgical approach to excision of CR were extracted as well.
   RESULTS: A total of 141 studies (n = 77,924 participants) were included into the meta-analysis. CR was significantly more prevalent in patients with TOS than in healthy individuals, with pooled prevalence estimates of 29.5% and 1.1%, respectively. More than half of the patients had unilateral CR in both the healthy and the TOS group. The analysis showed that 51.3% of the symptomatic patients with CR had vascular TOS, and 48.7% had neurogenic TOS. Most CR were surgically excised in women using a supraclavicular approach.
   CONCLUSIONS: CR ribs are frequent findings in patients with TOS. We recommended counseling asymptomatic patients with incidentally discovered CR on the symptoms of TOS, so that if symptoms develop, the patients can undergo prompt and appropriate workup and treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established treatment for refractory essential tremor (ET). Initially, the target of choice was the thalamic ventralis intermedius nucleus (VIM). However, the zona incerta (ZI) has been suggested as a superior target. Both targets are considered safe and effective, but a direct comparison between these targets is lacking.
   METHODS: We analyzed a single-center cohort of 44 patients with ET treated with DBS between 1998 and 2017, targeting the VIM and/or ZI. Patient-reported outcome on the Washington Heights-Inwood Genetic Study of Essential Tremor rating scale, adverse events, and stimulation-induced side effects were assessed.
   RESULTS: Patient-reported outcome of ZI DBS (-2.2 +/- 1.2; 18 patients with 28 electrodes) was superior to VIM DBS (-1.2 +/- 1.4; 10 patients with 19 electrodes) (P < 0.01). There was no difference in adverse events between implantations in VIM (45%) and ZI (46%). Dysarthria stimulation-induced side effects were significantly more often reported after VIM DBS (P = 0.01), whereas visual stimulation-induced side effects occurred more often after ZI DBS (P = 0.04).
   CONCLUSIONS: In this study, ZI DBS was superior to VIM DBS in terms of patient-reported effectiveness. There was a comparable number of complications between both targets. This finding further supports ZI over VIM as the principal DBS target in essential tremor.

ID POSTOPERATIVE-PATIENT POSTURE; SPONTANEOUS RESOLUTION; NONSURGICAL
   TREATMENT; MANAGEMENT; RECURRENCE
AB BACKGROUND: Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is a common entity in neurosurgical practice. However, as a result of the high rate in recurrence, morbidity, and mortality for surgical management, conservative management of CSDH is emerging as a new treatment strategy. Head trauma is a known risk factor of CSDH and plays as an initiator in the genesis of CSDH. We hypothesized that physical activity might also play an important role in the progression of an asymptomatic CSDH.
   METHODS: A prospective pilot study aiming to evaluate the efficacy of reinforced restriction of physical activity for the management of asymptomatic or mild symptomatic CSDH was conducted. Twenty-six patients were enrolled in this study.
   RESULTS: All 26 patients experienced complete resolution of the CSDH ranging from 32 to 182 days (73.1 +/- 19.6 days) since the initiation of reinforced restriction of physical activity. Ages ranged from 43 to 84 years old (64.4 +/- 9.6 years). No patient experienced recurrence of CSDH during the follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: According to our study, physical activity might play a role in the progression of CSDH. Further prospective randomized controlled study is warranted in stable patients without evident intracranial hypertension and impending cerebral herniation.

AB OBJECTIVE: We describe our technique and evaluate clinical and radiographic outcomes for patients undergoing L4/5 posterior lumbar interbody fusion with 3D-navigation guided cortical bone trajectory screws (PLIF-CBT) for grade 1 or 2 degenerative spondylolisthesis with a minimum follow-up time of 12 months.
   METHODS: A single-institution series of 18 patients was evaluated with data prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Pain and disability scores were collected preoperatively and at aminimum of 12 months postoperatively, including back and bilateral leg pain visual analog scores (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores. Radiographic fusion was assessed as complete, partial, or none based on the presence of bridging bones across the disc space, posterior elements, or both.
   RESULTS: Patients demonstrated statistically significant reductions in back pain VAS (P = 0.0025), leg pain VAS (P < 0.0001), and ODI (P < 0.0001) at a minimum of 12 months postoperatively. Radiographic fusion at an average of 14.9 months postoperatively was available for 16/18 patients, with 6 patients demonstrating fusion (4/6 with complete fusion; 2/6 with partial fusion). There were no instances of intraoperative complications or delayed complications requiring subsequent interventions.
   CONCLUSIONS: PLIF-CBT can be performed in a safe and reproducible fashion with excellent clinical outcomes at 1 year postoperatively. The outcomes did not correlate with fusion status, which was unexpectedly low at 37.5% without significant hardware abnormalities necessitating reoperations. PLIF-CBT offers several perioperative advantages compared with traditional open PLIF and requires longer-term studies to demonstrate its durability with regard to improvement in clinical pain and radiographic endpoints, including anterior and/or posterior element fusion.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the anatomic trajectory of the extracranial needle for percutaneous rhizotomy and correlate this with structures at risk during such a procedure.
   METHODS: Six sides from 3 frozen fresh Caucasian heads were used in this study. Hartel anatomic landmarks for percutaneous trigeminal rhizotomy procedures were used. A free hand technique was then used, and intra-procedural visualization of the needle was performed with fluoroscopy. When the procedure was completed, the face was dissected along with the needle pathway up to the foramen ovale in order to evaluate for any damaged structures.
   RESULTS: On all sides, the needle passed lateral to the buccinator muscle and near the parotid duct to then pierce the superior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle to enter the infratemporal fossa. This placed the needle near the buccal nerve on all sides, although no direct injury was noted. Although very near, no branches of the facial nerve or artery were damaged. On 1 side, the maxillary artery was pierced.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the detailed extracranial anatomic needle pathway using the Hartel approach. Such data might help surgeons better recognize potential complications from such procedures.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to prospectively compare the radiographic and clinical outcomes between the posterior fossa decompression (PFD) and PFD with duraplasty (PFDD) procedures in adolescent patients with Chiari malformation type I (CMI).
   METHODS: Ninety adolescent patients with CMI were randomly assigned to undergo either PFDD or PFD. In both groups, a dissection from the occipital bone was performed. The dura was not opened in the PFD group, and the outer layer of dura was resected. However, in the PFDD group, the dura mater was opened and expanded. Data were analyzed for clinical outcome, complications, and syrinx resolution.
   RESULTS: The age, gender, and preoperative neurologic status were similar between the 2 groups. Compared with the PFD group, patients undergoing PFDD had significantly longer operation time, longer postoperative drainage time, and higher drainage volume. At the latest follow-up, no statistically significant difference was found between the 2 groups in terms of syrinx resolution. The clinical outcomes were similar in the PFDD and PFD group. Compared with the PFD group, patients in the PFDD group had a higher incidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak.
   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the more aggressive decompression with duraplasty, PFD without duraplasty produces comparable radiologic and clinical outcomes and is associated with a lower risk of complications.

DT Article
DE Microvascular decompression; Nest shape; Teflon; Trigeminal neuralgia
ID HEMIFACIAL SPASM; GRANULOMA; MANAGEMENT
AB OBJECTIVE: To develop an improved technique for microvascular decompression (MVD) surgery using nestshaped Teflon fibers.
   METHODS: Eighteen consecutive patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) who underwent MVD using nest-shaped Teflon fibers between January 2012 and December 2013 were included in this investigation. During the surgery, the Teflon prosthesis was formed into a nest shape by gently pushing it from the center toward the periphery. Immediate postoperative outcomes were evaluated using a numerical rating scale score, and patients were followed up for recurrence.
   RESULTS: Immediately after the surgery, pain was completely relieved in 16 patients (88.9%) and partially relieved in 2 patients (11.1%). Seven patients (38.9%) developed postoperative complications. All complications were successfully mitigated before discharge. The patients were followed up for 2.0-3.4 years. During follow-up, recurrence was observed in 2 patients (11.1%). No Teflon adhesion or Teflon-induced granuloma was found.
   CONCLUSIONS: The nest-shaped Teflon fibers in MVD surgery for TN is safe and applicable. The long-term outcomes and the comparison between hollow nest-shaped implants and the standard cigar-shaped implants should be assessed in future investigations with larger sample sizes.

AB OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the long-term effects of Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) on remnants in the cavernous sinus (CS) after transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) for acromegaly and to identify its possible adverse effects.
   METHODS: Thirty patients who had remnant tumors only inside the CS after TSS and who consequently underwent GKS were included. They were followed for a median period of 47 months after GKS with regular hormonal and radiologic examinations.
   RESULTS: The mean tumor volume and margin dose irradiated by GKS was 3.7 cm(3) and 26.2 Gy, respectively. Radiologic tumor control was identified in all patients, and no tumor regrowth or recurrent tumors were identified. For 14 patients who achieved endocrinologic remission, the median duration from GKS until remission was 35 months. The actuarial rates of remission at 2, 5, and 10 years were 7.1%, 43.6%, and 65.6%, respectively. The degree of decrease in the nadir GH level in the OGTT at 6 months after GKS was a statistically significant predictor of remission. Newly developed hypopituitarism frequently developed in a time-dependent manner. Radiation necrosis developed in 4 patients with relatively large remnant volumes.
   CONCLUSIONS: GKS is an effective adjuvant treatment option for remnant tumors inside the CS after TSS. Maximal surgical resection, leaving minimal volume of remnants only inside the CS, allows the safe and sufficient delivery of a radiation dose to tumors, thereby increasing the possibility of remission. However, the risk of new hypopituitarism and radiation necrosis should be considered when tumors inside the CS are treated with GKS.

AB BACKGROUND: Cervical transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) is considered one of the most effective treatments for radicular pain induced by cervical foraminal stenosis.
   PURPOSE AND DESIGN: We sought to evaluate the treatment outcome of TFESI according to the severity of cervical foraminal stenosis. In our retrospective study there were 53 patients with cervical radiculopathy due to cervical foraminal stenosis.
   OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain intensity was evaluated using a numeric rating scale (NRS) at pretreatment, 2 weeks, and 1, 2, and 3 months after TFESI.
   METHODS: Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the severity of stenosis by cervical axial magnetic resonance imaging findings. Twenty-two patients were assigned to group A (nonsevere stenosis), and 31 patients were assigned to group B (severe stenosis).
   RESULTS: Thirty-seven (69.8%) of 53 patients showed successful treatment outcome (>50% reduction in the NRS score at 3 months). The patients in both groups showed a significant decrease in NRS scores at 2 weeks and at 1, 2, and 3 months after TFESI. However, the effect of TFESI was not significantly different between patients with nonsevere cervical foraminal stenosis and those with severe cervical foraminal stenosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: The treatment outcome of cervical TFESI did not different according to the severity of cervical foraminal stenosis. However, on the basis of our results, we suggest that TFESI can be a beneficial clinical option for managing radicular pain due to cervical foraminal stenosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Prosthetic replacement of the ocular surface ecosystem (PROSE) treatment is an effective, nonsurgical therapeutic option for patients with ocular surface disease related to cranial nerve deficits secondary to skull base tumor resection.
   METHODS: This case series describes the impact of PROSE treatment in patients with symptomatic exposure keratopathy or neurotrophic keratitis after skull base tumor surgery.
   RESULTS: All patients improved symptomatically and functionally with PROSE treatment, and have had sustained improvement for as long as 3 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: In postneurosurgical cases in which neurologic function may recover, PROSE treatment offers a safe, nonsurgical treatment option to support the ocular surface during the period of observation awaiting neurologic recovery.

AB OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to evaluate whether newly developed calcium phosphate cement (CPC), mounted around the titanium plates, is useful for aesthetic cranial reconstruction by using 2 methods.
   METHODS: The morphologic changes of CPC were observed in videos of 6 patients who had undergone cranial reconstruction with CPC during the first surgery and required second surgery. The facial aesthetic outcomes of 74 consecutive patients, more than 12 months after frontotemporal or bifrontal craniotomy and reconstruction with or without CPC, were evaluated.
   RESULTS: Observations of CPC changes were available 1 day, 2 weeks, 2 months, 5 months, 10 months, and 26 months after the first surgeries. CPC, applied superficially on the cranial surface, had not set sufficiently. CPCs, mounted thickly around the titanium plates and forming hydroxyapatite, were residual during the latter period. Comparison between the aesthetic reconstruction group (with CPC) and the simple reconstruction group (without CPC) showed that the objective bump detected by the investigator, and the subjective bump noticed by the patients themselves, were significantly more frequent in the simple reconstruction group. Comparison between the patients without an objective bump and the patients with an objective bump during the follow-up period showed that the proportion of patients after aesthetic cranial reconstruction with CPC was significantly higher in patients without an objective bump. Patients' characteristics, craniotomy procedure, use of a vascularized pericranial flap, and craniotomy-associated complications did not influence the objective bump significantly.
   CONCLUSIONS: Use of CPC was expected to bring better aesthetic outcomes after neurosurgical cranial reconstructions.

DT Article
DE Emergency department; External ventricular drain; Intensive care unit;
   Neurosurgeon; Operating room; Ventriculostomy
ID DRAIN PLACEMENT; RISK-FACTORS; HYDROCEPHALUS
AB BACKGROUND: External ventricular drain (EVD) placement is a common neurosurgical procedure used to control acute hydrocephalus and other neurosurgical complications. The infection and complication rates reported in the literature are highly variable, and iatrogenic factors determine the outcome of drain placement. We examined the impact of the setting of EVD placement (emergency department [ED] vs. intensive care unit [ICU] vs. operating room [OR]) and the experience of the operating surgeon on the infection rate, complication rate, EVD replacement, eventual placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, and the need for further surgical intervention.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center study conducted at University Hospital in Newark, New Jersey.
   RESULTS: A total of 190 EVDs were placed in 163 patients. The infection rate was 6.13%, and the complication rate was 12.3%. Six out of the 10 patients with infection had the EVD placed in the ICU, but this was not significant (P = 0.1172). Patients with a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1 or 2 (dead or vegetative) after the procedure were significantly more likely to have an EVD placed in the ED or ICU (P = 0.0173). Although junior residents placed a greater number of drains than senior residents, the infection and complication rates were not significantly different between the 2 groups (P = 0.1142 and 0.8502, respectively). EVD infection also was not significantly correlated with patient sex, age, initial diagnosis, drain replacement, or duration of drain placement. The most common organisms cultured were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study did not identify any significantly greater risk of infection or complications with EVDs placed in the OR or at the bedside, or with EVDs placed by less-experienced surgeons.

DE Carotid endarterectomy; Carotid revascularization; Cerebral blood flow;

ID HYPERPERFUSION SYNDROME
AB BACKGROUND: Hyperperfusion syndrome (HPS) is a well-known complication of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) warranting repeatable inexpensive monitoring. Transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS) may provide a potential modality for such monitoring, but little is known about TCCS trends after CEA.
   METHODS: Between January 2016 and February 2017, we prospectively included patients with CEA at our institute in this study. TCCS was performed preoperatively and repeated daily from the operation day until postoperative day (POD) 7. Daily trends in mean flow velocity (MFV) at the M1 portion of the middle cerebral artery were compared between patients with and without HPS.
   RESULTS: Among 35 patients with CEA, daily TCCS monitoring was performed in 18 patients (mean age +/- SD, 72 +/- 7 years; male/female, 17: 1). Among these 18 patients, 3 had probable HPS. On POD 0, MFV of the 18 patients showed a 32% increase from the initial preoperative value (from 52.5 to 69.4 cm/s, P = 0.0013). This increased MFV lasted for several days and recovered gradually by POD 7. Patients with probable HPS demonstrated a trend to higher MFV than those without; however, the difference was below the significance level.
   CONCLUSIONS: We used daily TCCS after CEA to depict cerebral blood flow changes after CEA in our cohort. This technique may be useful both for the detection and prevention of HPS.

   MEDULLA-OBLONGATA; SPINAL-CORD; INTRAMEDULLARY HEMANGIOBLASTOMA
AB BACKGROUND: Posterior cranial fossa (PCF) hemangioblastomas are benign, highly vascularized, and well-differentiated tumors with well-described histopathologic features. Although relatively rare, this tumor is the most prevalent primary tumor of the cerebellum in adults.
   OBJECTIVE: Because the demographics of patients with such a tumor (as well as the clinical, morphologic, pathologic, surgical features, and outcomes) are not fully understood, we systematized characteristic patient and tumor features.
   METHODS: We undertook a systematic review of the English-language literature in PubMed for PCF hemangioblastomas in adults published in the past 31 years. We analyzed geographic distribution and year of publication of articles; demographic data of patients; presenting symptoms and clinical signs; tumor location and morphology; histopathologic features, extent of tumor resection, perioperative blood loss, and postoperative complications; length of hospital stay; and outcomes.
   RESULTS: We reviewed 207 articles describing 1759 infratentorial hemangioblastomas in a cohort of 1515 adult patients. We found female predominance in patients with Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHLD) compared with male predominance in the general patient group. Symptoms of intracranial hypertension were more common in the VHLD group compared with the general group of patients. The cerebellar location was more common in the VHLD group and solid (parenchymatous) tumor was the most common type. Most patients underwent total resection but rate of resection did not differ between the general and VHLD groups. Most patients had a favorable outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: The literature of adult PCF hemangioblastomas is limited and general surgical experience with such tumors is scarce because of their rarity. Rates of postoperative complications and mortality remain higher than expected. However, prognosis and surgical outcomes are generally favorable. Nevertheless, surgery of adult PCF hemangioblastomas is a demanding and challenging task.

AB BACKGROUND: Nonvestibular cranial schwannomas represent a rare type of benign intracranial tumor. Few studies have evaluated the use of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) as a primary management option for these lesions. We performed a retrospective review of our institution's experience focusing on efficacy with regard to tumor control and clinical symptom stabilization as well as treatment safety.
   METHODS: Patients were included if they underwent at least 1 SRS procedure for a nonvestibular schwannoma and had at least 6 months of available imaging follow-up. Demographic, SRS dose planning, clinical, and imaging data were collected from chart reviews of treated patients. chi(2) and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed.
   RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2016, 35 schwannomas were treated in 34 patients. Median follow-up was 48 months. Median age at time of treatment was 51 years. Three patients had neurofibromatosis 2. Schwannoma location was trigeminal (57%), facial (20%), jugular foramen (14%), abducens (6%), and trochlear (3%). Median margin dose delivered was 13 Gy. The 5-year and 10-year tumor control rates were 94.4% and 88.5%, respectively. Presenting clinical symptoms stabilized or improved in 79% of cases after radiosurgery, and new or worsening symptoms were seen in 21%.
   CONCLUSIONS: SRS is a safe and effective modality for treatment of nonvestibular cranial nerve schwannomas.

AB BACKGROUND: Total removal of craniopharyngiomas is burdened by high morbidity. In cases of a cystic or mixed craniopharyngioma, when the symptoms are caused by the cystic component of the tumor, a less invasive surgical approach aiming at cyst drainage may be recommended. Here, we report our experience with intraventricular neuroendoscopy, describe our clear-cut surgical technique, and analyze results in the context of literature data.
   METHODS: We reviewed the clinical data of 8 consecutive adult patients affected by cystic or mixed craniopharyngioma who were treated with intraventricular neuroendoscopy at our institution in the last decade. At surgery, wide opening and emptying of the cyst was performed; a ventricular catheter with adjunctive holes was then placed to maintain a continuous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) washout. A systematic review of the pertinent literature was performed and a pooled analysis of individual data from selected studies was made.
   RESULTS: Ten neuroendoscopic procedures were performed. The treatment determined immediate neurologic and radiologic improvement without significant complications in all patients. No chemical meningitis was observed. Recurrence rate was 20%, in line with literature data. Median progression-free survival was 57 months. The systematic review of the literature showed that neuroendoscopy carries a lower recurrence rate than stereotaxy (P = 0.0390). Moreover, the creation of a cyst-CSF communication is a protective factor against recurrences. Finally, adjuvant radiotherapy determined no significant differences in terms of cyst recurrence rate.
   CONCLUSIONS: We describe a neuroendoscopic treatment of cystic craniopharyngiomas that, without adjuvant radiotherapy, is safe and effective and ensures long-term recurrence-free survival.

AB OBJECTIVE: Unilateral hemilaminectomy, which is used to remove spinal cord tumors, is simpler than laminoplastic laminotomy and affords certain biomechanical advantages. However, both incomplete tumor removal and inadvertent infliction of spinal cord damage attributable to the narrow surgical corridor remain of concern. When a spinal cord tumor is to be removed, it is important to ensure that the dural window along the surgical corridor is of adequate width. This study aimed to determine that the utility of lateral base dural tacking (LBT) method when cord tumor surgery is performed using a unilateral hemilaminectomy-a comparison of dural window widths with a traditional dural tack-up and a suspending-out (DSO) method with the aid of digital image-analysis software.
   METHODS: Twenty-one consecutive patients who had intradural-extramedullary spinal cord tumors removed using a unilateral hemilaminectomy were included in the study and analyzed retrospectively. We acquired DSO and LBT dural window images using surgical microscopes under identical conditions in consecutive order and then removed the tumors using the LBT method. We used digital image-analysis software to analyze the images quantitatively. The pixel numbers of LBT and DSO window were compared using a paired t test.
   RESULTS: Twenty-one tumorous lesions were successfully removed without any major problems using a unilateral hemilaminectomy through LBT windows. The mean pixel numbers of the LBT and DSO windows were 126,787 +/- 41,938 and 85,940 +/- 21,638. The LBT windows were 46% larger than the DSO windows (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: We objectively proved that the utility of the LBT method for widening the surgical corridor created during hemilaminectomy.

AB BACKGROUND: The treatment of multilevel lumbar degenerative disease (LDD) is complicated and challenging, and the optimal surgical strategy remains controversial.
   OBJECTIVE: To compare the differences in clinical and radiologic outcomes and in complications after 1-level interbody fusion versus multilevel interbody fusion for the treatment of multilevel LDD.
   METHODS: A total of 100 patients with multilevel LDD were randomized in a 1: 1 ratio into the 1-level interbody fusion group or the multilevel interbody fusion group. Clinical and radiologic results and major complications in the 2 groups were analyzed. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale for radicular and back pain, the Oswestry Disability Index, and the short-form 36 physical score. Clinical status was assessed by the Whitecloud classification. Radiologic evaluation included assessment of lumbar lordosis, pelvic incidence, and sacral slope.
   RESULTS: There were no significant differences in clinical and radiologic results between the 2 groups. Procedure duration and intraoperative blood loss were significantly greater in the multilevel interbody fusion group than in the 1-level interbody fusion group; the multilevel interbody fusion group also had greater incidences of temporary nerve root palsy, wound infection, and adjacent segment disease.
   CONCLUSION: A hybrid technique including 1-level interbody fusion and multilevel posterolateral fusion is recommended for patients with multilevel LDD.

   EMBOLIZATION; MANAGEMENT; MALFORMATIONS; COMPLICATIONS; AVOIDANCE
AB BACKGROUND: Ethmoidal dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are rare and aggressive lesions, usually treated by microsurgical disconnection of the fistula. Transarterial embolization rarely is performed because of the risk of retinal ischemia. Transvenous embolization has been reported as an alternative approach. We describe our experience in transvenous embolization of ethmoidal DAVFs and review the literature focusing on technical and safety aspects of the procedure.
   METHODS: We retrospectively identified 4 patients with ethmoidal DAVFs treated by transvenous embolization in a single center. Clinical data and angiographic images were reviewed. We reviewed the literature after PubMed searching for articles describing patients treated by a transvenous approach.
   RESULTS: One patient was treated by transvenous coiling and 3 patients by retrograde Onyx injection through a detachable-tip microcatheter. Three fistulas drained in an ascending cortical frontal vein and one drained posteriorly in the olfactory vein. In all patients the fistula was occluded, in one case an asymptomatic hemorrhage occurred. In the literature 12 further cases of transvenous embolization of ethmoidal DAVFs have been reported.
   CONCLUSIONS: Transvenous embolization is an effective approach for the treatment of ethmoidal DAVFs in properly selected patients. Onyx injection through detachable-tip microcatheters increases the feasibility of the intervention.

AB BACKGROUND: Although microvascular decompression (MVD) has been widely accepted as an effective treatment for hemifacial spasm (HFS), some patients may experience delayed relief instead of immediate improvement after the surgery. The need for and timing of repeat MVD has been controversial to date; thus, we conducted the present study with emphasis on those unrelieved patients.
   METHODS: Between January 2010 and December 2014, 3095 patients with idiopathic HFS were treated with MVD at XinHua Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine. Among these patients, 174 (5.6%) reported no symptom relief. Those patients without immediate relief were the focus of this study, and all were reevaluated at 2 years after MVD surgery.
   RESULTS: Among these 174 patients, 96 underwent redo MVD within 1 week of the first procedure (early MVD redo group), 19 underwent redo between 3 and 12 months after the first procedure (late MVD redo group), and 59 were observed (observation group). In the early redo MVD group, immediate improvement was reported by all patients except 1, who did not experience symptom relief until 3 months later. In the later redo MVD group, immediate symptom improvement was reported by 14 of 19 patients. By the end of the 2-year follow-up period, 1 recurrence occurred in the early redo MVD group, no changes occurred in the later MVD group, and 9 patients improved in the observation group. Ultimately, the final rates of symptom relief were 99.0% in the early redo MVD group, 73.7% in the later redo MVD group, and 15.3% in the observation group (P < 0.01). In the early redo MVD group, postoperative courses showed no significant differences between the first and the second operations. In the later redo MVD group, 1 patient developed a mild facial palsy and 1 had a cerebrospinal fluid leak.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that MVD is the most effective treatment for patients with HFS. An early reoperation is easier and safer than a later reoperation and may improve the likelihood of immediate relief.

AB OBJECTIVE: Selection of patients with acute ischemic stroke for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is complex and time-critical. Benefits of EVT are well established for patients with small core infarcts. The aim of this study was to compare clinical outcomes of EVT in patients with larger established infarcts (Alberta Stroke Programme Early CT Score [ASPECTS] <= 6) with patients with smaller infarcts (ASPECTS 7-10).
   METHODS: The study included 355 patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion who underwent EVT. ASPECTS was assigned to baseline non-contrast computed tomography, and collateral perfusion scores were assigned to multiphase computed tomography angiography. Baseline stroke severity, collateral grading, and clinical outcome data (complication rate, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and 90-day modified Rankin Scale score) were compared between patients with borderline (<= 6) and high (7-10) ASPECTS.
   RESULTS: There were 34 (10%) patients with borderline ASPECTS. There was no difference in rate of good clinical outcome (37% vs. 46%, P = 0.852), symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (9% vs. 9%, P = 0.984), or mortality (20% vs. 22%, P = 0.818) between patients with borderline ASPECTS and high ASPECTS at 90 days. Moreover, there was no significant difference in collateral perfusion grade.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies similar clinical benefit of EVT in patients with acute large vessel occlusion stroke with borderline ASPECTS and high ASPECTS.

AB BACKGROUND: Treating wide-necked aneurysms is challenging for the interventional neuroradiologist. Recently, numerous devices dedicated to the treatment of these aneurysms have become available. We report our early experience using the pCONus2 device and present the technical success rate, clinical outcomes, and immediate angiographic occlusion rates.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected data to identify patients treated with the pCONus2 device between February 2015 and February 2017.
   RESULTS: We identified 12 patients (10 females) treated with the pCONus2 device. The average patient age was 56.6 +/- 15.8 years (range, 13-71 years). The average aneurysm dome width was 8.83 +/- 5.3 mm (range, 3.8-20 mm), the average dome height was 7.23 +/- 4.06 mm (range, 3.36-15 mm), and the average neck width was 5.88 +/- 2.92 mm (range, 2.77-11 mm). The angulation of the aneurysm to the parent vessel varied between 0 and 78 degrees (mean, 32.2 degrees). Ten aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation, and 2 were in the posterior circulation. Immediate posttreatment angiography showed 11 aneurysms with modified Raymond-Roy classification (mRRC) grade I occlusion and 1 aneurysm with mRRC grade II occlusion. There were no deaths or hemorrhagic complications. Three patients developed small thrombi during treatment, all of whom were successfully treated with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists. Early angiographic follow-up data for 6 patients showed adequate aneurysm occlusion in 5 patients and aneurysm recanalization in 1 patient.
   CONCLUSIONS: The early results on the use of the pCONus2 device suggest that it can be useful for treating wide-necked aneurysms; however, larger studies with longer-term follow-up data are needed.

AB OBJECTIVES: To identify the risk factors for foot drop in patients with lumbar disc herniation (LDH).
   METHODS: Two hundred thirty-six patients who underwent surgery for LDH were retrospectively reviewed. Foot drop was defined as tibialis anterior muscle strength of lower than grade 4 by the manual muscle test. Possible risk factors, including demographic and radiographic parameters, were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analysis.
   RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (22.9%) suffered from foot drop. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that diabetes mellitus, disc calcification, patients who had an acute episode or acute-on-chronic episode, and patients who presented with lateral recess or extraforaminal type of disc herniation were at greater risk of foot drop. Notably, patients who had a canal occupancy rate of more than 50% were at greater risk of foot drop compared with patients who had a canal occupy rate of less than 25%. With a 1.0-mm increase in anteroposterior diameter of the index spinal canal, the risk of developing foot drop decreased to 51.8% in these patients (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: The following factors may affect the development of foot drop in patients with LDH: 1) diabetes mellitus; 2) patients with an acute episode or acute-on-chronic episode; 3) patients with lateral recess or foraminal type of herniation; 4) disc calcification; 5) canal occupancy rate greater than 50%; and 6) the anteroposterior diameter of canal. Surgical treatments for patients with those risk factors should be implemented positively during the follow-up period to reduce possible adverse outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between obesity and outcomes after microdiscectomy for lumbar disc herniation.
   METHODS: The primary outcome measure was change in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at 1 year after surgery. Obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI) >= 30. Prospective data were retrieved from the Norwegian Registry for Spine Surgery.
   RESULTS: We enrolled 4932 patients, 4018 nonobese and 914 obese. For patients with complete 1-year follow-up (n = 3381) the mean improvement in ODI was 31.2 points (95% confidence interval 30.4e31.9, P < 0.001). Improvement in ODI was 31.4 points in nonobese and 30.1 points in obese patients (P = 0.182). Obese and nonobese patients were as likely to achieve a minimal clinically important difference (84.2 vs. 82.7%, P = 0.336) in ODI (>= 10 points improvement). Obesity was identified as a negative predictor for ODI improvement in a multiple regression analysis (BMI 30-34.99; P < 0.001, BMI >= 35; P = 0.029). Obese and nonobese patients experienced similar improvement in Euro-Qol-5 scores (0.48 vs. 0.49 points, P = 0.441) as well as back pain (3.7 vs. 3.5 points, P = 0.167) and leg pain (4.7 vs. 4.8 points, P = 0.654), as measured by the Numeric Rating Scale. Duration of surgery was shorter for nonobese patients (55.7 vs. 65.3 minutes, P <= 0.001). Nonobese patients experienced fewer complications compared with obese patients (6.1% vs. 8.3%, P = 0.017). Obese patients had slightly longer hospital stays (2.0 vs. 1.8 days, P = 0.004).
   CONCLUSIONS: Although they had more minor complications, obese individuals experienced improvement after lumbar microdiscectomy for lumbar disc herniation similar to that of nonobese individuals.

   OUTCOMES; COHORT; TRIAL; RATES
AB OBJECTIVE: The aging population in industrialized countries shifts the age limit for neurosurgical interventions toward increasingly older patients. This study investigates whether octogenarians (>= 80 years) stand out in outcome and incidence of perioperative complications.
   METHODS: Consecutive patients >= 80 years operated on between January 2013 and August 2016 were compared against a control group of patients aged 55-75 years matched by indication for surgery. Status at admission, perioperative complications, functional outcome, and mortality were assessed in a prospective patient registry. Complications were classified in the therapy-oriented Clavien-Dindo grading (CDG) system.
   RESULTS: We compared 266 octogenarians (median age, 83 years; interquartile range, 81-86 years; 154 men) with 232 controls (median age, 67 years; interquartile range, 60-71 years; 151 men). At follow-up (median, 53 vs. 49 days), median modified Ranking Scale scores were 2 versus 1 and median Karnofsky Performance Status was 80 versus 90; both improved significantly compared to baseline (P < 0.0001). Only admission Karnofsky Performance Status was significantly associated with clinical outcome at follow-up (odds ratio, 1.05; P < 0.0001). Pharmacologic treatment (CDG 2) was sufficient in 56% of all complications in octogenarians (controls, 43%). Octogenarians were more prone to complications as an inpatient (36% vs. 28%; P = 0.04) because of a higher incidence of CDG 2 complications (20% vs. 12%; P = 0.02). The rate of complications that required more extensive therapy did not differ significantly between cohorts.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgery in octogenarians had a similar rate of severe complications, morbidity, and mortality as in matched controls. Therefore, age alone should not serve as a contraindication for neurosurgery.

TI Utility of Retrograde Amnesia Assessment Alone, Compared with
   Anterograde Amnesia Assessment in Determining Recovery After Traumatic
   Brain Injury: Prospective Cohort Study
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Amnesia; Anterograde; Posttraumatic; Retrograde
ID POSTTRAUMATIC AMNESIA; HEAD-INJURY; PRACTICAL SCALE
AB BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic amnesia (PTA) after traumatic brain injury (TBI) comprises anterograde amnesia (AA), disorientation, and retrograde amnesia (RA). However, RA is often neither assessed nor emphasized. A recent study demonstrated that although AA and disorientation were both present in non-TBI inpatients uniformly taking opioids, RA was absent. This suggests potentially significant utility with RA assessment alone since opioids are commonly prescribed post TBI.
   METHODS: We compared RA recovery with AA recovery in a prospective cohort post TBI. The Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT) represented a crude test for PTA (GOAT <75). AA was primarily assessed using the Westmead PTA Scale, and RA was assessed using the GOAT. All patients were prescribed oxycodone.
   RESULTS: Results were obtained (n = 31). While RA recovery coincided with a GOAT recovery in 19/31 (61%), AA recovery coincided with GOAT recovery in only 6/31 (19%), (chi(2) = 11.5, P < 0.001). RA recovery preceded AA recovery in 15/31 (48%), while AA recovery preceded RA recovery in 7/31 (23%) (chi(2) = 8.6, P = 0.003). Where RA recovery less frequently followed AA recovery, temporal lobe contusions were more frequent. RA recovery preceded/coincided with AA recovery in 100% of those who recovered when AA was defined as x3 consecutive 12/12 scores (as is current widespread practice). AA recovery typically followed RA recovery with minimal delay.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the presence of potential in-hospital confounders including opioids, RA recovered significantly sooner after TBI than AA and was predictive of imminent AA recovery. RA assessment alone therefore had significant and novel utility in post-TBI assessment. RA assessment should be routinely recorded in all PTA assessment. Given its simplicity and resilience to common confounders, RA assessment should also be incorporated into the Glasgow Coma Scale.

AB INTRODUCTION: In Chiari I patients, postoperative pain and discomfort frequently slow the transition back to the home setting.
   OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the effect of standardized ketamine infusion protocols on hospital length of stay (LOS).
   METHODS: This retrospective cohort study reviewed 100 consecutive adult patients undergoing Chiari I decompression. Fifty-nine patients were placed on a 2-3 mg/hr ketamine drip until postoperative day 1. This group was compared with a group who received 2-3 mg/hr of ketamine until postoperative day 2 (19 patients) and patients who did not receive ketamine at all (22 patients). Clinical characteristics, opioid use, LOS, and relative hospitalization costs were assessed. All narcotic amounts were converted into milligram equivalents of morphine.
   RESULTS: LOS of the short-ketamine group was 46.5 hours when compared with the long-ketamine group (66.8 hours) and no-ketamine group (56.9 hours). There was a statistically significant difference when comparing the short-ketamine group with the long-ketamine group and no-ketamine group together (P < 0.001), as well as when compared individually (P = 0.001 and 0.004). The mean cost of hospitalization was 20% less when a short-ketamine protocol was used (P < 0.001). Mean morphine milligram equivalents used postoperatively were 148 mg in the short-ketamine group, 196 mg in the long-ketamine group, and 187 mg in the no-ketamine group (P = 0.65). No adverse events from ketamine were noted.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine at subanesthetic levels may be an effective tool to facilitate early return home postoperatively and may significantly reduce medical costs.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore the change of coagulation function and associated potential mechanisms and the relationship between coagulation disorders and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) within 3 days of onset.
   METHODS: A total of 150 patients with SAH within 3 days of onset and 100 healthy individuals were recruited. Thrombelastography analysis and traditional laboratory tests were performed. Tissue factor (TF), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and activated protein C (APC) were tested by using enzyme-linked immunoassay kits. Extremities of patients with SAH were scanned by Doppler ultrasonography. Subgroup analysis was performed in patients with SAH based on the presence or lack of DVT.
   RESULTS: Compared with control groups, R (an indicator of coagulation factor function in thrombelastography) was significantly decreased (4.32 +/- 0.99 minutes vs. 6.00 +/- 0.75 minutes; P < 0.001), especially in patients with DVT. TF was significantly increased (20.84 +/- 4.15 pg/mL vs. 5.24 +/- 1.86 pg/mL; P < 0.001). TFPI was decreased (50.42 +/- 5.81 ng/mL vs. 64.10 +/- 6.04 ng/mL). APC had no apparent changes. R was negatively correlated with TF (r = 0.358; P < 0.05) and positively correlated with TFPI (r =0.325; P < 0.05) and APC (r = 0.162; P < 0.05). TF, TFPI, and APC had the same variation characteristics in the DVT subgroup compared with the no DVT subgroup. DVT was associated with R through association analysis (r = 0.369; P < 0.05). The R cutoff value for estimating the presence of DVT was 3.65 minutes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Coagulation factor hyperfunction may be mainly accompanied within 3 days of SAH onset and may induce DVT. This situation may be associated with TF-TFPI-APC imbalance. R = 3.65 minutes was a potential intervention point to prevent the risk of DVT in this population.

AB BACKGROUND: In vascular reconstructive surgery, intraoperative confirmation of patency is performed by angiography, Doppler, or indocyanine videoangiography, but it is sometimes insufficient.
   OBJECTIVE: Using the FLOW 800 system (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), we confirmed patency in a quantitative relative evaluation of the timing of the luminance change of the regions of interest (ROIs) on the donor and recipient. -METHODS: Thirty-seven patients (58 anastomoses) were divided into 2 groups: those with arteriosclerotic ischemic disease (CI group; n = 23) and those with cerebral aneurysm (AN group; n = 14). Four ROIs were set: the donor, proximal, and distal sides of the recipient middle cerebral artery (MCA) and cortical MCA (control MCA). The half-life for fluorescence intensity was calculated by using the FLOW 800 system. A delay map analysis was also performed. -
   RESULTS: In the CI group, there were statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) between the donor vessel and control MCA, proximal MCA and MCA control, and distal MCA and control MCA. The investigation with the delay map showed red tones in 20/22 patients in the CI group and in 2/17 patients in the AN group.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the CI group, the transit time of the donor vessel was shown relatively early as red T. When good patency has been achieved, the FLOW 800 system can be used to confirm patency more reliably, especially in ischemic regions. The unique point of this research is that the patency of anastomotic vessels was evaluated as a quantitative value of its rendering time rather than as a change in fluorescence intensity.

AB BACKGROUND: The long-term outcome after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is determined by many confounding factors. Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is linked to atherosclerotic stroke, and it is an important cause of death during the perioperative and follow-up periods after CEA. We aimed to investigate mortality and long-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in patients with IHD compared with patients who do not have IHD.
   METHODS: We consecutively enrolled 229 patients who underwent CEA procedures from 2000 to 2011. Of these patients, 45 had known or probable IHD defined by history or medical record of myocardial infarction, stable/unstable angina, previous coronary revascularization such as percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft, or positive stress test. Long-term outcome was identified by using death certificates from the Korean National Statistical Office and telephone interviews by June 2013. We investigated predictors of early (<= 30 days) and long-term mortality and MACEs (stroke, myocardial infarction, and death).
   RESULTS: Mean follow-up period was 49 months. Cox proportional analysis adjusted for potent predictors revealed symptomatic stenosis (hazard ratio, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.88; P = 0.042) and presence of IHD (hazard ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-3.42; P = 0.025) as significant predictors of long-term MACEs. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significantly lower rate of survival (P = 0.030) and MACE-free survival (P = 0.003) in the IHD group.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a poor long-term outcome was observed in patients with IHD and symptomatic stenosis but not in patients with conventional high-risk factors for surgery. Therefore, appropriate evaluation and treatment of IHD before and after CEA might be helpful for better outcome.

AB BACKGROUND: Tentorial meningiomas are notorious for their critical location. Selection of a suitable approach that exposes the multicompartmental growth of tumor is important for a complete and safe resection. This paper discusses about various operative approaches and their overall surgical outcome.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our 41 patients with tentorial meningiomas. They were classified according to the modified Yasargil classification. The symptomatic improvement and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed at follow-up.
   RESULTS: Tumors were almost equally distributed in all location groups. Tumors along the lateral tentorial hiatus were operated on via a subtemporal or transsylvian approach. Tumors along the posterior tentorial hiatus, tentorial membrane, or torcula were operated on by an occipital interhemispheric transtentorial, infratentorial supracerebellar, or a combined approach. Tumors along the petrous attachment were operated on by a retromastoid suboccipital or a combined presigmoid-retrosigmoid approach. Seventy-six percent had total excision (Simpson grade 1 and 2). Group II tumors had the highest total resection rate (100%). Headache and diplopia were the symptoms that significantly improved postoperatively. Over a median follow-up of 65 months, 13 patients (31.7%) had recurrence. There was no significant difference in recurrence rates and PFS in tumors at different locations. Extent of excision and tumor grade were the significant factors affecting PFS in both univariate and multivariate analysis (P = 0.01 and 0.03, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Similar to intracranial meningiomas at other locations, extent of resection and tumor grade significantly affect the PFS for tentorial meningiomas. Careful preoperative planning based on the location and extension of the tumor guides the optimal surgical approach that translates into maximal safe resection.

AB BACKGROUND: The giant intracranial meningioma (GIM) constitutes a different spectrum of brain tumors that invade the vital neurovascular structures, which makes the primary mode of treatment, surgery, a technically challenging one. The surgery for GIM is unique because of the large size of the tumor, prominent vascularity, entangling and limited visualization of various neurovascular structures, and severe cerebral edema. This study reports the authors surgical experience of 80 GIM cases, the operative challenges and surgical outcome.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 80 patients with histologically proven meningioma (>= 5 cm) who underwent surgical treatment at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (Shreveport, Louisiana, USA) over a 20-year period (1995-2015) is presented. The clinical and radiologic data were collected from the hospital database. The tumors were categorized into histologic groups according to World Health Organization (WHO) classification. The relevant statistical analysis of the study was conducted using SPSS software, version 22.0.
   RESULTS: The study included 27 male patients (33.8%) and 53 female patients (66.3%). The mean age of the cohort was 56 years (56.3 +/- 16.1). The mean size of the tumor was 56.4 +/- 4 mm with a range from 50 mm to 84 mm. Skull base was the most common location of GIM (57 patients, 71.3%). Simpson grade 1 excision was achieved in 9 patients (11.3%), whereas grade 2 excision was achieved in 57 patients (71.3%); 80% of the tumors belonged to WHO grade 1. The operative mortality was seen in 4 patients (5%). Regression analysis showed that age, sex, location of the tumor, neuronavigation, Simpson grade of excision, and histology of tumor were the factors that significantly affected the recurrence-free survival (RFS).
   CONCLUSIONS: The surgery for GIM is unique in different ways. As surgery for GIM is formidable, radiologic characteristics can be useful adjuncts for planning an effective and safe surgical strategy. The factors such as young age, male sex, use of neuronavigation, and skull base location positively influenced RFS, whereas Simpson grade 3 or 4 and poor histologic grade adversely influenced RFS. A careful preoperative evaluation, understanding of the risk factors, effective surgical approach, and judicious use of intraoperative adjuncts are the key factors with pivotal roles in GIM resection.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to perform an integrated survival analysis of patients with bilateral thalamic glioma and to assess the influence of various prognostic factors on overall survival.
   METHODS: A literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was performed for literature in English published from 1964 to May 2017. Detailed information including demographics, clinical characteristics, treatments, critical events, and time to events for survival analysis were extracted from the included articles. In addition, 2 cases diagnosed in our institution were included.
   RESULTS: The study included 53 cases from 32 published articles and 2 cases from our institution that were selected for analysis. Univariate analysis showed the duration of symptoms (>= 2 or <2 months), glioma type (astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme), and World Health Organization (WHO) grade (low or high) had a significant correlation with overall survival (log-rank P = 0.011, 0.001, and < 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that the duration of symptoms (hazard ratio [HR], 0.299; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.121-0.736; P [0.009), and WHO grade (HR, 4.639; 95% CI, 1.891-11.382; P = 0.001) were independent prognostic factors for bilateral thalamic glioma (BTG) survival.
   CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive analysis of rare BTG patients revealed that a longer duration of symptoms (>= 2 months) and low WHO grade were significantly associated with improved survival and were independent prognostic factors for overall survival.

AB OBJECTIVE: Microvascular decompression (MVD) is an effective method for directly treating the etiology of trigeminal neuralgia (TGN). This study aims to investigate the factors that predict complete pain relief after MVD for treatment of TGN, and to study efficacy and safety in older patients.
   METHODS: This study was conducted in patients with TGN that were treated by MVD at Siriraj Hospital between 2004 and 2015. Cases with secondary TGN were excluded. Data was gathered from medical records, preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, intraoperative findings, and by telephone in patients lost to follow-up.
   RESULTS: Of 110 included patients, 68 and 42 patients were younger and older than 60 years, respectively. Median age was 53.6 years old. Typical type of TGN, paroxysmal pain, large offending vessel on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, and multiple locations of trigeminal nerve compression were associated with early postoperative pain-free status. No variables were associated with long-term outcome. Multivariate analysis using binary logistic regression revealed typical type of TGN to be the only factor associated with early postoperative pain-free status. No significant difference was observed between the <60 and >= 60 age groups for surgical outcome and rate of complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Presence of typical type TGN was the only factor found to independently predict a pain-free outcome in the early postoperative period. No factors were associated long-term pain-free outcome. MVD is an effective and safe operative procedure, and it should be regarded as a safe and viable alternative for treating intractable TGN in older patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests a survival benefit for patients with glioblastoma who undergo maximal safe surgical resection. Not all glioblastomas are amenable to surgical resection and anatomic location is one potentially limiting factor. Glioblastomas that invade the corpus callosum and cross midline to the contralateral hemisphere-butterfly glioblastomas (bGBMs)-are one subgroup of tumors traditionally deemed inoperable.
   METHODS: We evaluate the management of bGBMs at our institution to assess whether surgical resection is feasible, safe, and more effective than biopsy. We retrospectively reviewed our institutional brain tumor registry for all adult patients treated for glioblastoma (World Health Organization grade IV) between 2004 and 2016 to identify all bGBMs.
   RESULTS: Survival between biopsy and resection was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier model. Twenty-nine (3.8%) of 764 newly diagnosed GBMs were identified as bGBM. Of these, 9 patients (31.0%) underwent surgical resection and 20 patients (69.0%) underwent biopsy. Five patients (55.6%) in the surgical resection group had 98% extent of resection or greater. Median survival of our entire cohort of patients was 3.3 months. Median survival was higher in the surgical resection groups (7.8 vs. 2.8 months; P = 0.0019). Increased age is independently associated with increased risk of death, and adjuvant therapy is independently associated with prolonged survival.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection of butterfly glioblastoma prolongs survival without increased risk of permanent neurologic deficit. Both anterior and posterior bGBMs can be resected safely.

AB OBJECTIVE: The causes and epidemiology of traumatic cervical spine fracture have not been described with sufficient power or recency. Our goal is to describe demographics, incidence, cause, spinal cord injuries (SCIs), concurrent injuries, treatments, and complications of traumatic cervical spine fractures.
   METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision E-codes identified trauma cases from 2005 to 2013. Patients with cervical fracture were isolated. Demographics, incidence, cause, fracture levels, concurrent injuries, surgical procedures, and complications were analyzed. t tests elucidated significance for continuous variables and chi(2) for categorical variables. Level of significance was P < 0.05.
   RESULTS: A total of 488,262 patients were isolated (age, 55.96 years; male, 60.0%; white, 77.5%). Incidence (2005, 4.1% vs. 2013, 5.4%), Charlson Comorbidity Index (2005, 0.6150 vs. 2013, 1.1178), and total charges (2005, $71,228.60 vs. 2013, $108,119.29) have increased since 2005, whereas length of stay decreased (2005, 9.22 vs. 2013, 7.86) (all P < 0.05). The most common causes were motor vehicle accident (29.3%), falls (23.7%), and pedestrian accidents (15.7%). The most frequent fracture types were closed at C2 (32.0%) and C7 (20.9%). Concurrent injury rates have significantly increased since 2005 (2005, 62.3% vs. 2013, 67.6%). Common concurrent injuries included fractures to the rib/sternum/larynx/trachea (19.6%). Overall fusion rates have increased since 2005 (2005, 15.7% vs. 2013, 18.0%), whereas decompressions and halo insertion rates have decreased (all P < 0.05). SCIs have significantly decreased since 2005, except for upper cervical central cord syndrome. Complication rates have significantly increased since 2005 (2005, 31.6% vs. 2013, 36.2%). Common complications included anemia (7.7%), mortality (6.6%), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (6.6%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Incidence, complications, concurrent injuries, and fusions have increased since 2005. Length of stay, SCIs, decompressions, and halo insertions have decreased. Indicated trends should guide future research in management guidelines.

AB BACKGROUND: Postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the cavity after resection of brain metastases improves local control. We hypothesized that significant cavity constriction would occur from the immediate postoperative period to the time of SRS and aimed to elucidate optimal treatment timing.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 79 consecutive patients with 85 resection cavities treated with SRS after gross total resection of a brain metastasis. Preoperative lesion, immediate postoperative cavity, and cavity at the time of SRS were contoured for each patient. Factors influencing cavity size and interval cavity change were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Median immediate postoperative cavity volume was 7.5 cm(3), and median SRS cavity volume was 8.7 cm(3). Median time from surgery to SRS was 20 days. Median volumetric cavity change was an increase of 28%. Of cavities, 34 (40%) increased in size >2 cm(3), whereas only 8 cavities (9%) decreased in size >2 cm(3); 43 cavities (51%) had <= 2 cm(3) change. The largest postoperative cavities experienced the smallest percentage cavity change in the time interval to SRS (Spearman correlation -0.32, P = 0.003).
   CONCLUSIONS: Cavity size after brain metastasis resection increased a median of 28% from immediate postoperative scan to time of SRS. Greater than 90% of postoperative cavities either increased >2 cm(3) or remained within 2 cm(3) of their immediate postoperative cavity volume. Early postoperative SRS within 2-3 weeks may be appropriate to minimize cavity growth. Delaying postoperative SRS beyond 3 weeks in hopes of significant cavity contraction is not warranted.

TI The Relationship Between Intracranial Pressure and Age-Chasing
   Age-Related Reference Values
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Age; Children; Day vs. night; Intracranial pressure; Reference values
ID CEREBRAL PERFUSION-PRESSURE; INFUSION TEST; LUMBAR
AB BACKGROUND: No true reference values for intracranial pressure (ICP) in humans exist; current values are estimated from measurements in adults who undergo treatment in order to correct ICP. We report ICP values in a "pseudonormal" group of children and adults to examine if age affects ICP.
   METHODS: We analyzed data from all nonshunted patients undergoing a 24-hour ICP monitoring as part of a diagnostic work-up and included patients with no subsequent suspicion of increased ICP and no need for pressure-relieving treatment with a minimum follow-up period of 3 years.
   RESULTS: From February 2008 to November 2014, a 24-hour ICP monitoring was performed in 221 patients. Of these patients, 35 (14 children, 21 adults) met the inclusion criteria. Follow-up time to confirm absence of ICP-related disease was 3-9 years. Daytime ICP was 2.8 mmHg +/- 2.2 in children and 1.9 mmHg +/- 4.2 in adults (P = 0.39). Of 35 patients, 32 had higher nighttime ICP. The difference between daytime and nighttime ICP was similar in children (Delta ICP = 5.8 mmHg +/- 4.0, P < 0.0001) and adults (Delta ICP = 6.1 mm Hg +/- 3.3, P < 0.0001). ICP could be described as a decreasing function of age, with an ICP decrement of 0.69 mmHg per decade (P = 0.015).
   CONCLUSIONS: We found similar differences in daytime and nighttime ICP between children and adults with no ICP-related disease. ICP seems to decrease with age across all ages. This has implications for therapeutic interventions (e.g., shunt valve selection or resistance in external ventricular drainage).

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe 27 patients with 32 web vessels (WVs) from our practice and provide a review of the literature regarding imaging diagnostics, clinical presentation, and treatment of WVs.
   METHODS: A MEDLINE search was performed using combinations of the following terms: "stroke in young adults," "web," "recurrent stroke," "diaphragm-like," "atypical fibromuscular hyperplasia," "atypical fibromuscular dysplasia," "septal fibromuscular dysplasia," "septa," "diaphragms," "pseudovalvular folds," and "carotid diaphragm." Our series was added in this review.
   RESULTS: According to location, there were 88 carotid WVs (91.66%), 7 vertebral WVs (7.3%), and 1 subclavian WV (1.04%). According to clinical presentation, the reported WVs caused stroke in 81 cases (84.38%). Treatment was supportive care in 46 cases (47.91%), surgery in 33 cases (35.41%), and an endovascular procedure through angioplasty and stenting in 17 cases (17.7%). Variables such as age (P = 0.7565), sex (P = 0.6912), and location (P = 0.7993) were not shown to be risk factors for stroke in these patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although few cases have been reported in the literature, the stroke rate in patients with WVs is high. Endovascular treatment is presented as an effective form of treatment with no associated morbidities or recurrences of ischemic events.

AB BACKGROUND: Type II odontoid fracture is a highly morbid injury among octogenarians, with 41% 1-year mortality. Our objective was to assess long-term fusion, complication, and survival rates.
   METHODS: Retrospective review of prospective trauma registry and blinded review of follow-up radiographs.
   RESULTS: Follow-up cohort included 94 nonoperative and 17 operative patients (median, 52 and 79 months). The operative group had significantly higher rates of repeated surgery for primary treatment failure or complication (1% vs. 18%; P = 0.01) and dysphagia, aspiration events, or tracheostomy (29% vs. 78%, P = 0.002; 6% vs. 30%, P = 0.04; 1% vs. 18%, P = 0.01). Three-year all-cause mortalities were 71% and 76%, respectively (P = 0.78). No delayed myelopathy was observed. One-year postinjury radiographs were available for 13 and 6 patients in the nonoperative and operative groups (P = 0.9); bony unionwas observed in 3 and 5 patients (23% vs. 83%; P = 0.04). Retrolisthesis greater than 2 mm was observed in 2 and 1 patients (15% vs. 17%; P = 1.0). Two patients in the operative group underwent repeated surgery for primary treatment failure. Dysphagia was diagnosed in 3 and 5 operative patients (23% vs. 83%; P = 0.04), whereas aspiration events occurred in 0 and 3 patients (0% vs. 50%; P = 0.02). Three-year mortalities in this cohort were 38% and 67% (P = 0.35).
   CONCLUSIONS: Radiographic union is significantly associated with operative management, but the corresponding clinical benefit is unclear. Complications were significantly more common after surgery. Long-term survival in octogenarians following type II odontoid fracture is poor, independent of management. Frequent complications without a proven survival benefit suggest that most patients are better managed conservatively.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate role of surgery plus radiotherapy (RT) in patients with metastatic epidural spinal cord compression from breast cancer with a follow-up >10 years.
   METHODS: The study included 23 patients treated between 2004 and 2008. Surgical treatment was performed in patients with good performance status, limited metastatic disease, and progressive neurologic deficit and/or intractable pain. RT was performed delivering a median total dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Clinical outcome was evaluated using the modified visual analog scale for pain, Frankel grade for neurologic deficit, and magnetic resonance imaging before and after treatments and every 3 months thereafter.
   RESULTS: Minimal resection was performed in 17.4% of patients, curettage in 47.8%, and total tumorectomy in 34.8%, followed by RT in 78.3%. Pain remission was obtained in 98% of patients, and recovery of neurologic function was obtained in 92.9%. Median follow-up time was 153 months (range, 128-209 months). No relapse at site of treatments occurred. Median overall survival time was 47 months (95% confidence interval 33-114 months), and 2-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival rates were 81% (+/- 8.6%), 42.9% (+/- 10.8%), and 28.6% (+/- 9.9%). On univariate analysis, performance status, type of surgical resection, breast cancer phenotype, and presence of other bone meta-stases were recorded as influencing survival; the last-mentioned was also confirmed in multivariate analysis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgery plus RT is a safe and feasible treatment with limited morbidity. In selected patients with good performance status, positive hormonal receptors, and limited metastatic disease, surgical intervention should be strongly considered early on.

AB BACKGROUND: Anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) is a surgical technique indicated for the treatment of several lumbar pathologies. Smoking has been suggested as a possible cause of reduced fusion rates after ALIF, although the literature regarding the impact of smoking status on lumbar spine surgery is not well established. This study aims to assess the impact of perioperative smoking status on the rates of perioperative complications, fusion, and adverse clinical outcomes in patients undergoing ALIF surgery.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on a prospectively maintained database of 137 patients, all of whom underwent ALIF surgery by the same primary spine surgeon. Smoking status was defined by the presence of active smoking in the 2 weeks before the procedure. Outcome measures included fusion rates, surgical complications, Short-Form 12, and Oswestry Disability Index.
   RESULTS: Patients were separated into nonsmokers (n = 114) and smokers (n = 23). Univariate analysis demonstrated that the percentage of patients with successful fusion differed significantly between the groups (69.6% vs. 85.1%, P = 0.006). Pseudarthrosis rates were shown to be significantly associated with perioperative smoking. Results for other postoperative complications and clinical outcomes were similar for both groups. On multivariate analysis, the rate of failed fusion was significantly greater for smokers than nonsmokers (odds ratio 37.10, P = 0.002).
   CONCLUSIONS: The rate of successful fusion after ALIF surgery was found to be significantly lower for smokers compared with nonsmokers. No significant association was found between smoking status and other perioperative complications or adverse clinical outcomes.

ID THORACOLUMBAR SPINE; INSIGNIFICANT INJURY; BLUNT TRAUMA; CT
AB BACKGROUND: Although isolated transverse process fractures (ITPF) do not confer any inherent risk of compromised spinal stability, there is increasing interest in their overall prognostic significance. As a proxy for localized or directional forces in high-energy traumatic mechanisms, ITPF may serve as an indicator for the presence of other coexisting traumatic injuries. Specific injuries may be predicted by the presence of ITPF at specific spinal levels, but few studies have examined this in depth and may not account for confounding variables.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 306 patients presenting with acute traumatic ITPF. ITPF number and location by spinal segment were determined from initial computed tomography. Mechanism of trauma, Injury Severity Score, and extent of nonespinal-associated injuries were recorded. Correlation analysis compared ITPF location with injury severity, nonespinal-associated injury location, type, and patterns. Significant injury associations were further explored with logistic regression analysis controlling for age, mechanism of injury, and Injury Severity Score.
   RESULTS: The adjusted odds of pulmonary visceral injury was 4.69 (95% confidence interval, 2.33-9.44) times higher among patients with thoracic-level ITPF compared with other ITPF levels. Lumbar ITPFs had increased odds of abdominal visceral injury (odds ratio, 4.85; P = 0.0002), pelvic fractures (odds ratio, 4.2; P < 0.0001). The number needed to scan to observe a pelvic injury among patients with lumbar ITPF was 3. Other significant associations were also observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Spinal level of ITPF is associated with increased likelihood of specific patterns of injury, and additional investigation is warranted.

   MANAGEMENT; OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND: Cervical spondylitic myelopathy is a degenerative condition resulting from chronic spinal cord compression and a leading cause of nontraumatic spinal cord dysfunction. The chief surgical goal in the management of cervical spondylitic myelopathy is adequate spinal cord decompression with or without fusion to slow or prevent further neurologic decline. We conducted a radiographic analysis of canal parameters preoperatively and postoperatively for patients undergoing either anterior or posterior cervical decompression.
   METHODS: Preoperative and postoperative radiographic analysis was performed using midsagittal and axial magnetic resonance imaging at the level of the disc space for 37 patients who underwent anterior or posterior cervical decompression. Statistical comparisons between anterior and posterior groups were performed using independent t test and Mann-Whitney U test where appropriate.
   RESULTS: Both postoperative anteroposterior canal diameter and posterior cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space were greater in patients undergoing posterior decompression (P = 0.011 and P < 0.001, respectively), although postoperative anterior CSF space was comparable between both groups. Both anterior and posterior approaches to decompression resulted in a statistically significant improvement in anteroposterior diameter, anterior CSF space, and posterior CSF space (P < 0.001). Posterior decompression yielded significantly greater change in anteroposterior diameter and posterior CSF space compared with the anterior approach (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: In this quantitative radiographic study, we found that although both posterior cervical laminectomy and anterior cervical discectomy yielded significant decompression, laminectomy yielded a greater degree of decompression of the posterior CSF space.

AB OBJECTIVE: Reoperation and readmission are often avoidable, costly, and difficult to predict. We sought to identify risk factors for readmission and reoperation after spine surgery and to use these factors to develop a scoring system predictive of readmission and reoperation.
   METHODS: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database for years 2012 to 2014 was reviewed for patients undergoing spinal surgery, and 68 perioperative characteristics were analyzed.
   RESULTS: A total of 111,892 patients who underwent spinal surgery were identified. The rate of reoperation was 3.1%, the rate of readmission was 5.2%, and the occurrence of either was 6.6%. Multivariate analysis found 20 perioperative factors significantly associated with both readmission and reoperation. Preoperative and operative factors found significant included age >60 years, African-American race, recent weight loss, chronic steroid use, on dialysis, blood transfusion required, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification >= 3, contaminated wound, >10% probability of experiencing morbidity, and operative time >3 hours. Postoperative associations identified included urinary tract infection, stroke, dehiscence, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, septic shock, deep and superficial surgical site infection, reintubation, and failure to wean from ventilator. An unweighted and weighted risk score were generated that yielded receiver operating characteristic curves with areas under the curve of 0.707 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.701-0.713) and 0.743 (95% CI: 0.736-0.749) 0.708 (95% CI: 0.702-0.715), respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with an unweighted score >= 7 had a more than 20-fold increased risk of reoperation or readmission and a more than 1000-fold increased risk of mortality than did patients with a score of 0.

AB BACKGROUND: Few reports have compared surgical intervention with conservative treatment for moyamoya disease (MMD) in non-Asian cohorts. This study describes the effectiveness of follow-up stroke prevention by indirect revascularization relative to conservative management in a Northeast United States study population.
   METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed records of patients with MMD at our institution from 1990 to 2014. Baseline characteristics and follow-up results including subsequent ipsilateral strokes were collected, and compared between an indirect revascularization group and a conservatively treated group on a per-hemisphere basis.
   RESULTS: A total of 94 patients with 184 hemispheres were included. The average age was 23.9 +/- 18.1 years, with 76.6% (n = 141) being female. Racial distribution comprised white (n = 75, 40.8%), African-American (n = 57, 31.0%), Asian (n = 30, 16.3%), and other (n = 22, 12.0%). Eighty-three hemispheres (45.1%) presented with ipsilateral stroke and 54 (29.3%) with ipsilateral TIA. Management strategies included either conservative management (51.1%) or indirect bypass (48.9%). Patients who were male (P < 0.001), on baseline antiplatelets (P = 0.043), or with speech disturbance (P = 0.002) were more likely to receive indirect revascularization. Patients with headache history were more likely to be treated conservatively (P = 0.046). History of ipsilateral stroke was borderline associated with indirect bypass (P = 0.058). During a follow-up period of 6.37 +/- 5.81 years, the annual risk of stroke for indirect revascularization group was 0.93% and 2.70% for the conservative group. Multivariate analysis found that increasing age (P = 0.029), posterior cerebral artery involvement (P = 0.040), and conservative treatment (P = 0.048) were associated with follow-up stroke.
   CONCLUSION: Our results suggests that indirect revascularization provides symptom relief and lower risk of stroke during follow-up compared with conservative management. Indirect revascularization should be considered for symptomatic MMD patients with a low surgical risk profile in a similar patient population.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate delayed complications in patients with brain arteriovenous malformation (BAVM) after Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery and to present the salvage therapy experiences of patients with BAVM with radiation-induced changes (RICs) or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).
   METHODS: This cohort consisted of 44 patients with BAVM who underwent failed GKRS between 2000 and 2015. These patients were further divided into an RIC group (23 patients) and an ICH group (21 patients) based on their post-GKRS complications. The patients' characteristics, treatment strategies, and long-term outcomes were analyzed. The modified Rankin Scale was used to assess the neurologic status of each patient.
   RESULTS: In our study, the marginal dose and radiosurgery-based arteriovenous malformation score were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Craniotomy was performed in 26 patients (9 patients with ICH and 17 patients with RICs), and histologic examination showed cavernous angioma changes in 6 patients. In addition, 6 patients underwent repeat radiosurgery in the ICH group, and 7 patients used bevacizumab in the RIC group. Thirty patients showed good outcomes at the last follow-up (modified Rankin Scale score <3).
   CONCLUSIONS: Salvage therapy for patients with BAVM should be performed based on the latency period and lesion characteristics of each individual. Prompt treatment and a longer follow-up are recommended to achieve good clinical outcomes.

AB INTRODUCTION: Chordomas are rare primary bone tumors with a low-grade histology but an aggressive clinical behavior characterized by local invasion and recurrence. When occurring in the skull base, their treatment is limited by proximity to critical neurovascular structures. Open surgical approaches can carry high morbidity, making the development of alternative approaches desirable. We describe our experience with endoscopic endonasal approaches to clival chordomas over 13 years.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with clival chordomas and treated with an endoscopic endonasal approach between 2003 and 2015 at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. We reviewed presenting symptoms, tumor location and size, extent of resection, complications, recurrence, adjuvant treatment, retreatment, and follow-up duration.
   RESULTS: A total of 23 charts were reviewed, with 17 included in our final review. Mean age was approximately 48 years. The most common presenting symptom was diplopia present in 70.6% of patients. Mean tumor volume was 20.2 cm(3). Gross total resection was achieved in 52.9% of patients. With a mean follow-up period of 63.4 months, 5 patients had a recurrence. The most common complication was cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, which was noted in 6 patients. Tumor volume was significantly higher in patients with CSF leak. No correlation between intradural extension and postoperative CSF leak was noted.
   CONCLUSIONS: Clival chordoma are challenging entities to treat. The best outcomes are achieved with gross total resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy treatment. We show that the endonasal endoscopic corridor is a viable alternative approach to these lesions.

AB BACKGROUND: To minimize surgical morbidity, surgeons may opt to perform segmental limited surgery instead of fusion extension for adjacent segment disease (ASD) after lumbar fusion surgery. This study evaluated clinical outcomes from segmental limited surgery without fusion extension for ASD and assessed which clinical factors were associated with reoperation after segmental limited surgery.
   METHODS: Medical data of 50 patients who underwent segmental limited surgery for ASD after lumbar fusion surgery between 2005 and 2015 were reviewed. Demographic data, ASD type, preoperative disc and facet degeneration, ASD location, and surgical summary were collected. The primary outcome was reoperation rate at 24 months after surgery.
   RESULTS: Of patients, 28 (56%) experienced recurrent radiculopathy (visual analog scale score >= 4). Revision surgery was performed in 22 patients (44%). Reoperation was performed more frequently in multilevel fusion first-surgery cases (15/23; 65.2%) than single-level fusion first-surgery cases (7/27; 25.9%; P = 0.005). The lowermost mobile segment group had a lower reoperation-free survival rate than the other group (hazard ratio [9.85, 95% confidence interval 1.32-73.54, P [0.01 [log-rank]). The 2-year reoperation-free survival rate for the lowermost mobile segment group was 31.5%, whereas the rate for the other group was 83.3%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Segmental limited surgery as a treatment for ASD after lumbar fusion surgery is likely to fail frequently and result in a high rate of recurrent radiculopathy and revision surgery. Fusion extension surgery is especially recommended for ASD at the lowermost mobile segment owing to the high failure rate.

DE Clavien-Dindo grading system; Complications; Normal pressure
   hydrocephalus; Outcome measures; Ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery
ID SURGICAL EDUCATION SAFE; DIAGNOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting is a well-established therapy for hydrocephalus. However, complications are frequent. The incidence of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) increases with the aging of the population. We evaluated the functional status of patients and the classification of complications associated with VP shunt procedures in our center.
   METHODS: We recorded all VP shunt procedures in our prospective patient registry from January 2013 to December 2015. Functional outcome (Karnofsky Performance Status [KPS] and modified Rankin Scale) and complications were compiled from patient records. Any deviation from the normal postoperative course within 3 months after surgery was considered a complication. Complications were classified with the therapy-oriented Clavien-Dindo grading system. We evaluated potential risk factors with a logistic regression model.
   RESULTS: From 285 procedures in the reporting period, 90 were excluded, resulting in 195 patients. Among those patients, 174 (90%) were shunt implantations and 21 (11%) were shunt revisions. Forty-four shunts (23%) were implanted for NPH. Median KPS improved over the first year after surgery. Although some type of complication was observed in 114 patients (58%), 60 of those complications (31%) did not require surgical treatment (Clavien-Dindo grade <3). In 50 patients (26%), the complication concerned the shunt itself. A high KPS at admission and NPH as underlying indication significantly reduced the odds ratio for a complication.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although shunt surgery has a high general rate of complications, this rate is significantly lower for patients with NPH. The decision for shunting in patients with NPH should consider the low complication rate specific for the group of patients with NPH.

AB OBJECTIVE: Stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) requires extensive preoperative planning to optimize placement of electrodes and limit the potential for complications. Flat-detector computed tomography (FD-CT) has previously been used for perioperative vascular imaging to guide the treatment of vascular lesions. This imaging modality provides a detailed depiction of cerebrovascular and bony cranial anatomy, which can be used to guide intracranial electrode implantation. We have developed a novel method to improve preoperative planning for sEEG electrode implantation and limit the potential for postoperative complications by using FD-CT imaging merged with preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   METHODS: All patients underwent preoperative FD-CT with selective intra-arterial iodinated contrast dye injection through the late arterial and capillary phases for evaluation of cerebrovascular anatomy. These results were merged with thin-cut MRI for trajectory planning of intracranial sEEG electrodes. All patients underwent routine CT and MRI after electrode placement.
   RESULTS: 39 patients have undergone sEEG implantation according to this protocol, with a total of 541 electrodes placed. Additionally, 25 (64.1%) patients underwent implantation of 70 oblique insular electrodes. There were no clinically significant complications after the implantations. Thirty-six (92.3%) patients underwent operative intervention, including surgical resection in 27 (69.2%) patients.
   CONCLUSION: FD-CT imaging allows for a detailed depiction of cortical cerebrovascular anatomy through the capillary phase, in addition to bony cranial anatomy. This enables the safe planning of complex trajectories, including high-obliquity insular electrodes and transsulcal trajectories through "empty sulci" while also providing concurrent imaging of bony anatomy to allow for preoperative planning of drill depth and anchor placement.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe the novel technique and report the outcomes of cervical spondylotic radiculopathy caused by facet joint hyperplasia treated with minimally invasive surgery by laminar and lateral mass screw cofixations.
   METHOD: In this retrospective study, patients with spondylotic radiculopathy caused by facet joint hyperplasia underwent this technique in our unit between January 2010 and June 2015. Hospital charts, magnetic resonance imaging studies, and follow-up records for all the patients were reviewed. Outcomes were assessed on the basis of neurologic status, magnetic resonance imaging, and visual analog scale for neck and radicular pain and by the short form-36 health survey questionnaire.
   RESULTS: Thirteen men and 5 women, aged 47-73 years (mean, 61.8 years), were included in this study. The follow-up time ranged from 19-50 months (mean, 32.4 months). The mean visual analog scale scores for radicular pain and neck pain, as well as the scores for all 8 domains of the short form-36 health survey questionnaire, showed significant improvements (P < 0.05). Cervical lordosis showed bending, whereas the height of the targeted disk segment showed no change (P > 0.05). Complications included 2 cases of neck pain that lasted for 3 months.
   CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive surgery by lamina and lateral mass screw cofixation is safe and effective for the treatment of cervical spondylotic radiculopathy caused by facet joint hyperplasia. In addition to sufficient decompression, this technique provides relative stability to the cervical spine.
