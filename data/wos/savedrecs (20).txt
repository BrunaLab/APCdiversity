AB The recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks make the development of efficacious and low cost vaccines against Ebola virus (EBOV) an urgent goal. Multiepitopic vaccines allow a rational design rendering vaccines able to induce proper immune responses in terms of polarization and potency. In addition, the pathogen variants can be easily covered by including epitopes conserved among relevant isolates. Other important aspects to consider in vaccination are the costs associated to production, distribution, and administration of the vaccine. Plants provide an advantageous platform for this purpose, since they yield biomass at very low costs and some species can be used to formulate purification-free oral vaccines. In the present study, a multiepitopic protein called Zerola, which carries epitopes from the EBOV glycoprotein (GP), was designed based on immunoinformatic approaches and current experimental evidence on B cell protective GP epitopes. Moreover, expression studies performed in nuclear-transformed tobacco lines confirmed the capacity of the plant cell to synthetize the Zerola antigenic protein. The generation of this plant-based candidate vaccine is a step forward in the development of highly efficient and low cost EBOV vaccines.

AB (R)-3-amino-1-butanol is a key intermediate of Dolutegravir for the treatment of HIV/AIDS and its green and efficient biosynthesis has attracted a great deal of attention. Transaminases are currently used as promising biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. However, many transaminases have (S)-specificity and (R)-selective transaminases were less exploited and studied, making the production of (R)-amines remain challenging. In this study, a novel transaminase from Actinobacteria sp. (As-TA) was obtained and applied for the biosynthesis of (R)-3-amino-1-butanol by transferring the amino group from isopropylamine to 4-hydroxy-2-butanone. After optimization of the reaction condition and using a substrate fed-batch strategy, the conversion of 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 mM 4-hydroxy-2-butanone reached 100%, 94.9%, 86.1%, 76.1% and 70.9%, respectively. (R)-3-amino-1-butanol with a maximum yield of 29.6 g/L and 99.9% e.e. value was obtained. This was the first time demonstrating the successful biosynthesis of (R)-3-amino-1-butanol with transaminase as biocatalyst and the obtained As-TA enriched the enzyme pool of transaminase with (R)-specificity.

AB Endoglucanase, an important component of cellulases, is used as additives in ensiling of forage crops. However, its detailed role is unclear in ensilages. In the present study, two endoglucanases Cel5 and Cel9 produced by strain Paenibacillus panacisoli SDMCC050309, previously isolated from ensiled corn stover, were identified in the cultures by microcrystalline cellulose absorption coupled with zymogram analysis. After heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli DE3 and purified, these two proteins were biochemically characterized. Cel5 was 61 kDa and showed maximal activity at pH 7.0 and 45 degrees C, while the maximum activity was at pH 8.0 and 65 degrees C for Cel9 with 97 kDa in size. Both of them could degrade carboxymethyl cellulose into cellooligosaccharides, in which cellobiose and cellotriose could be used as substrates for the growth of homofermentative strains Lactobacillus plantarum CGMCC6888 and L. farciminis CCTCC AB2016237, but not for the heterofermentative strains L. brevis SDMCC050297 and L. parafarraginis SDMCC050300. Therefore, we concluded that the added endoglucanase contributed to enhance the growth of homofermentative lactic acid bacteria for high level of lactic acid production in ensilages.

AB Engineering of Chinese Hamster Ovary cells by manipulating microRNA (miRNA) expression levels has been shown to induce advantageous, desired phenotypes. Most of these studies so far were concerned with increasing productivity or reducing growth rate (with the implied intention of thus freeing cellular resources to also increase productivity). Here we evaluated the ability of growth correlating miRNAs to increase the growth rate of CHO-K1 cells by transient overexpression or knock down, respectively. Candidates were selected based on the correlation between growth rate and miRNA expression levels as observed in previous studies. These candidates were then up-or downregulated initially by transfection of mimics or inhibitors and subsequently by transfection of plasmids bearing the corresponding miRNAs or sponges. None of the 40 selected candidates was able to induce a better growth phenotype under these conditions. Overlap between miRNAs identified to correlate to growth in published miRNA expression studies and those identified to actively increase growth rate in a functional screen is minimal, indicating that the here selected approach of traditional overexpression/knock down engineering of miRNAs may not be a suitable strategy for the purpose of increasing growth rate.

AB The aim of the present study was to produce biosurfactants using three bacterial strains (Pseudomonas cepacia CCT6659, Bacillus methylotrophicus UCP 1616 and Bacillus cereus UCP 1615) cultivated in mineral medium containing different carbon (glucose, sucrose, molasses and waste frying oil) and nitrogen [NH4NO3, (NH4)(2)SO4, peptone, yeast extract and corn steep liquor] sources. B. cereus stood out as the best biosurfactant producer when inoculated with a 1.5% cell suspension and cultivated at 28 degrees C and 200 rpm in 2.0% molasses and 1.0% corn steep liquor for 48 h. Under these conditions, medium surface tension was reduced to 26.2 +/- 0.2 mN/m, and biosurfactant concentration achieved 2.05 +/- 0.32 g/L. The biosurfactant showed a critical micelle concentration of 0.90 +/- 0.05 g/L, proved to be highly stable in wide ranges of pH, salt concentration and heating temperature, and exerted low toxicity to larvae of Artemia salina as a marine environmental bioindicator. Structural characterisation of biosurfactant suggested a lipopeptide composition. The biotensioactive agent was shown to effectively remove motor oil adsorbed to marine rock (91.0 +/- 0.4%) and to disperse it in seawater (70.0 +/- 0.4%). The biosurfactant formulated with 0.2% potassium sorbate demonstrated considerable potential for application in the petroleum industry, where it could be successfully used as a commercial product to mobilize oil in marine environments.

AB The microalga Acutodesmus obliquus was investigated as a feedstock in semi-continuously fed anaerobic digestion trials, where A. obliquus was co-digested with pig slurry and maize silage. Maize silage was substituted by both 10% and 20% untreated, and 20% ultrasonicated microalgae biomass on a VS (volatile solids) basis. The substitution of maize silage with 20% of either ultrasonicated and untreated microalgae led to significantly lower biogas yields, i.e., 560 dm(3) kg(-1) VScorr in the reference compared to 516 and 509 dm(3) kg(-1)VS(corr) for untreated and ultrasonicated microalgae substitution. Further, the viscosities in the different reactors were measured at an OLR of 3.5 g VS dm(-3) d(-1). However, all treatments with microalgae resulted in significantly lower viscosities. While the mean viscosity reached 0.503 Pa s in the reference reactor, mean viscosities were 53% lower in reactors where maize was substituted by 20% microalgae, i.e. 0.239 Pa s, at a constant rotation speed of 30 rpm. Reactors where maize was substituted by 20% ultrasonicated microalgae had a 32% lower viscosity, for 10% microalgae substitution a decrease of 8% was measured. Decreased viscosities have beneficial effect on the bioprocess and the economy in biogas plants. Nonetheless, with regard to other parameters, no positive effect on biogas yields by partial substitution with microalgae biomass was found. The application of microalgae may be an interesting option in anaerobic digestion when fibrous or lignocellulosic substances lead to high viscosities of the digested slurries. High production costs remain the bottleneck for making microalgae an interesting feedstock.

AB Cancer immunotherapy is considered to be one of the alternatives to traditional chemotherapy. It's known that foreign antigen, such as ovalbumin (OVA), can label tumor cells, leading to neoantigen recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Herein, a novel multifunctional micelle coated with PEGylated hyaluronic acid (HA) was prepared through self-assembly and electrostatic interaction. The OVA-loaded micelle with uniform size (132.1 +/- 0.2 nm in diameter) exhibited favorable stability and sustained release profiles. The HA-coated micelle could target CD44-overexpressed cells and enhance the cellular uptake of OVA by 11.9 fold compared to free OVA. In vitro studies revealed that the cationic polymer, polyethyleneimine, could facilitate endosomal escape of OVA to label a tumor cell. After treatment with the OVA-loaded micelle, tumor growth in mice was significantly inhibited by 70% compared to the group treated with free OVA. All these results suggest the potential application of the immunotherapeutic micellar platform for melanoma treatment.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the storage stability of inhalable phage powders containing lactose and leucine as excipient. As an FDA-approved excipient for inhalation, lactose is preferred over other sugars. PEV phages active against antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa was spray dried with lactose (55-90%) and leucine (45-10%). Produced powders were heat-sealed in an aluminium pouch at 15% relative humidity (RH) with subsequent storage at 20 degrees C/60% RH for 12 months. Lactose concentration in the powder positively influenced the phage stability over time. Formulation containing 90% lactose maintained the viability of PEV61 across the study, while similar to 1.2 log(10) titer reduction was observed in formulations with less lactose. PEV20 was more prone to inactivation (1.7 log(10) titer loss at 12-month) when lactose concentration in the particle was below 80%. The fine particle fraction (% wt. particles < 5 mu m in aerosol) of phage powders was 52-61% and remained the same after 12-month storage. The results demonstrate that spray dried PEV phage powders containing lactose and leucine are biologically and physically stable over long-term storage at ambient temperature. Furthermore, these spray dried phage powders were shown to be non-toxic to lung alveolar macrophage and epithelial cells in vitro.

AB The development of new blood vessels is directly related to the occurrence of eye diseases. Anti-angiogenic drugs can theoretically be extended to the treatment of ophthalmic diseases. In this study, axitinib, a class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, was loaded via the amphiphilic copolymer MPEG-PCL, improving its dispersibility in water. Axitinib-loaded micelles showed low toxicity in concentration gradient assays. Additionally, multiple doses by scratch assay confirmed that axitinib had no significant effect on normal cell migration, and biosafety test results showed good cell compatibility. After we established the corneal neovascularization model after an alkali burn in rats, the anti-angiogenic efficacy was tested, with dexamethasone as a positive control. The results showed that axitinib-loaded micelles had anti-angiogenic effects without obvious tissue toxicity. As a class of targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, axitinib can be used in the treatment of ocular neovascular diseases through nano-crystallization.

AB To avoid severe exacerbations in the load of hepatitis B virus (HBV) as a consequence of discontinuous use of anti-HBV drugs, entecavir (ETV), the first-line anti-HBV drug, was primally formulated as extended-release poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres in the present study. Because ETV is slightly soluble in water and in some other organic solvents used for microsphere preparation, methods for solid-microencapsulation were employed to fabricate the ETV microspheres. The optimized microspheres were evaluated for their morphology, particle size, drug loading, in vitro drug release, and in vivo pharmacokinetics in rats. The optimized formulation was found to have a mean particle size of 86 mu m and drug loading of 13%. Differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction indicated that ETV existed in crystal, amorphous, and molecular states in the microspheres. In vitro and in vivo release revealed that the dissolution of ETV dominated the release process. The morphology of the microspheres and changes in the morphology during in vitro release were assessed by scanning electron microscopy. The novel ETV-MS described in this study should have great potential for clinical use as an alternative treatment against HBV.

AB The evaluation of particle size recommended in the pharmacopeias requires a constant flow rate, and the method for pediatric inhaled drugs is the same as for adult drugs. In this study, the aerosol concentration and particle size distribution (PSD) were measured under a realistic breathing pattern and constant flow. Two types of nebulizer (i.e., breath-enhanced nebulizer and vibrating-mesh nebulizer) and two formulations (i.e., budesonide suspension and albuterol solution) were chosen for comparison. The aerosol concentration under the realistic pattern was not constant, which was different from the result at constant flow. The changing trend of aerosol concentration varied with the operation process of each device. The aerosol concentration profile was similar between budesonide suspension and albuterol solution. As to the PSD, as inspiratory flow increased, the X50 (50% undersize) increased with all nebulizers but Omron microAir NE-U22 nebulizer. There was good agreement between X50 obtained under the realistic inhalation patterns and their equivalent average flow rates by Bland-Altman analysis, although the X50 obtained under the realistic inhalation pattern was greater than value at constant flow. The agreement of the two breath-enhanced jet nebulizers was better than that of the vibrating-mesh nebulizers. The X50 of budesonide was not equal to that of albuterol when using the same nebulizer. Interestingly, a significant difference was observed in the X50 and Span when comparing the results of PSD under adult and child breathing patterns. Furthermore, all vibrating-mesh nebulizers produced aerosol droplets having larger mean diameter and narrower size distribution than those of the air-jet nebulizers. We conclude that it will be more conducive to the evaluation of particle size to use a laser diffractometer under a realistic pattern and make up for the shortcomings of cascade impactors. The effects of flow pattern, nebulizer and formulation should be taken into account in the evaluation of the qualifies of nebulizer products in pharmaceutical practice.

AB The surface structure of crystalline particles affects the functionality of the particles in drug delivery. Prediction of the final structure of particles that crystallize easily within the spray drying process is of interests for many applications. A theoretical framework was developed for the prediction of crystal structure precipitating on the surface of the particle. This model was based on the dimensionless Damkohler number (Da), to be an indicator of final particle morphology. Timescales of evaporation and reaction were required for calculation of the Damkohler number. The modified evaporation time scale was estimated based on the time that is available for the crystal to precipitate after supersaturation. The reaction time scale was estimated based on the time scale for induction time. Mannitol was produced under different processing conditions in order to validate the theoretical model. Results showed for the high Damkohler numbers, the surface structure of the particle was rough, while smaller Damkohler numbers led to relatively smooth particle surfaces. Additionally, although the beta polymorph was dominant in all of the experiments, alpha polymorph was precipitated in the experiments with a large Damkohler number. The theoretical framework developed will be a useful predictive tool to guide the manipulation of particle crystallization in spray dryers.

AB Metastasis poses a long-standing treatment challenge for many cancers including breast cancer. Once spreading out, cell-selective delivery of drug appears especially critical. Here, we report on epidermal growth factor receptor and CD44 dual-targeted hyaluronic acid nanogels (EGFR/CD44-NGs) that afford enhanced targetability and protein therapy for metastatic 4T1 breast cancer in vivo. Flow cytometry in CD44 and EGFR-positive 4T1 metastatic breast cancer cells showed over 6-fold higher cellular uptake of EGFR/CD44-NGs than mono-targeting CD44-NGs. MTT and scratch assays displayed that saporin-loaded EGFR/CD44-NGs (Sap-EGFR/CD44-NGs) was highly potent in inhibiting growth as well as migration of 4T1 cells in vitro, with an IC50 of 5.36 nM, which was 1.7-fold lower than that for SapCD44-NGs. In 4T1-luc metastatic breast cancer model in mice, Sap-EGFR/CD44-NGs exhibited significant inhibition of tumor metastasis to lung at a small dose of 3.33 nmol Sap equiv./kg. Increasing the dosage to 13.3 nmol Sap equiv./kg resulted in further reduced lung metastasis without causing notable adverse effects. These dual-targeted nanogels with improved cancer cell selectivity provide a novel platform for combating breast cancer metastasis.

AB Microencapsulation of pancreatic islets for the treatment of Type I Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) generates a high quantity of empty microcapsules, resulting in high therapeutic graft volumes that can enhance the host's immune response. We report a 3D printed microfluidic magnetic sorting device for microcapsules purification with the objective to reduce the number of empty microcapsules prior transplantation. In this study, INS1E pseudoislets were microencapsulated within alginate (A) and alginate-poly-L-lysine-alginate (APA) microcapsules and purified through the microfluidic device. APA microcapsules demonstrated higher mechanical integrity and stability than A microcapsules, showing better pseudoislets viability and biological function. Importantly, we obtained a reduction of the graft volume of 77.5% for A microcapsules and 78.6% for APA microcapsules. After subcutaneous implantation of induced diabetic Wistar rats with magnetically purified APA microencapsulated pseudoislets, blood glucose levels were restored into normoglycemia ( < 200 mg/dL) for almost 17 weeks. In conclusion, our described microfluidic magnetic sorting device represents a great alternative approach for the graft volume reduction of microencapsulated pseudoislets and its application in T1DM disease.

AB Fisetin loaded binary ethosomes were prepared and optimized using Box-Behnken design for dermal application to alleviate skin cancer. The prepared formulations were evaluated for vesicle size, entrapment efficiency and flux of fisetin. Additionally, the optimized formulation was further evaluated by transmission electron microscopy, confocal laser microscopy, vesicles-skin interaction, dermatokinetic study and DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl) assay. The in vivo study was carried out for the evaluation of tumor incidence, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-1 alpha, lipid peroxidation values, glutathione content and catalase activity in mice. The optimized binary ethosomes formulation presented sealed unilamellar shaped vesicles, with vesicles size, entrapment efficiency and flux of 99.89 +/- 3.24 nm, 89.23 +/- 2.13% and 1.01 +/- 0.03 mu g/cm(2)/h respectively. The confocal images of rat skin clearly illustrated the deeper penetration of rhodamine B loaded binary ethosomes formulation. Further, the binary ethosomes gel treated rat skin showed substantial increase in C-Skin max and AUC(0-8) in comparison to rat skin treated with conventional gel. In vivo study revealed that the mice pre-treated with fisetin binary ethosomes gel caused marked decrease in the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1 alpha as compared to the mice exposed to UV only. Further the binary ethosomes gel treated mice group had demonstrated less percentage of tumour incidences (49%) as compared to mice treated with UV only (96% tumour incidence). The novelty of the work lies in successful optimization of formulation using Box-Behnken design and characterization of binary ethosomes carrier of fisetin and demonstration of improved dermal delivery of the same. The overall data suggest that the fisetin loaded binary ethosomes formulation is a potential dermal delivery system for the management of skin cancer.

AB The central nervous system (CNS) is a vital part of human body which coordinate the actions by transmitting signals. Because of the existence of the blood-brain barrier and the blood-spinal cord barrier, diseases in CNS can hardly be directly intervened by non-invasive methods. While systemic delivery usually requires extravagant drug dosage and leads into toxicity in unexpected tissues, local drug delivery in CNS tissues provides a solution for the problems of physiological barriers and systematic side effects. Biomaterials are applied in local drug delivery system (LDDS) for CNS disease therapy with aims of tuning the drug release property and improving bioavailability, solubility, stability and safety of pharmaceutics. The indispensable importance and distinct physiological structure of cerebrospinal area bring about challenges to biomaterials in LDDS. Thus, properties of drug delivery systems are necessitated with prudently concern. In this review, the development of LDDS utilizing biomaterials will be presented, including sustained release, local parameter-responsible release, and regional cell-selective active targeting release. Studies on biomaterials employed as pharmaceuticals will give rise to a more efficacious method and the better understanding of LDDS design in CNS.

AB The transdermal route is a convenient non-invasive way for drug delivery, however, the hydrophobic compact nature of stratum corneum (SC) forms an obstacle hindering the diffusion of drugs particularly hydrophilic ones. Hence, the purpose of this study was to develop novel soft nano-vesicles, entitled Flexosomes, amalgamating two penetration enhancers, ethanol and one edge activator (EA) from various types and different hydrophilic-lipophilic balances. The tailored vesicles were loaded with tropisetron hydrochloride (TRO), a potent highly-soluble anti-emetic, and compared with ethosomes. Aiming to preclude the formation of rigid non-deformable mixed micelles, all critical parameters; EA type, phosphatidylcholine-to-EA molar ratio, and cholesterol concentration, were optimized proving their influences on vesicle-to-micelle transitions. The prepared formulations were characterized in terms of visual inspection, particle size, polydispersity, zeta potential, turbidity measurements, entrapment efficiency, and vesicle morphology. The permeation mechanisms were assessed by differential scanning calorimetry on isolated SC. The modified vesicles, based on ethanol and either vitamin E or PEGylated castor oil derivatives exhibited the highest transdermal fluxes confirmed by a deeply tracking to dermis using confocal laser microscopy. Both vesicles demonstrated higher bioavailability relative to ethosomes, topical and oral aqueous solutions. The findings endorsed the effectiveness of tailored nano-vesicles in boosting TRO skin transport suggesting their applicability with various drug entities for enhanced transdermal delivery.

AB Synchronized release, defined as simultaneous release of multiple components while keeping the inter-component ratios steady, is crucial to the design and development of sustained- or controlled-release delivery systems of herbal medicines. A theory of infinite dose dividing is proposed to interpret the rationale behind synchronized release. The key point of the mechanisms is to curb diffusion so as to offset the release divergence caused by differences in physicochemical properties of multiple components. In practice, pH-dependent gradient-release, erosion-controlled and osmotic pump delivery systems have been adapted to attain synchronized release of model herbal medicines. Nevertheless, synchronized release is still in the proof-of-concept stages and should be corroborated by more evidence with more model herbal medicines.

AB Afatinib, a selective and irreversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase, was approved for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression in 2013. Cetuximab (CTX), an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, is co-administered with afatinib to improve efficacy. Unfortunately, dose-related adverse reactions caused by combination therapy have affected patient compliance, and have resulted in treatment discontinuation in severe cases. In the present study, afatinib was encapsulated in "liposomes" (LPs) to achieve longer circulation in the blood and an enhanced permeability-and-retention effect in tumors. Concomitantly, CTX was designed to bind to drug-loaded LPs to form "immuno-LPs" for tumor-cell selectivity and therapeutic activity. In vitro, the cellular internalization rate of immuno-LPs was significantly higher than that of LPs (p < 0.05). In vivo, a markedly increased area under the curve and prolonged terminal half-life were detected in rats injected with the two LP formulations, indicating that LP encapsulation protected afatinib from binding to hemoglobin to control the risk of idiosyncratic drug reactions. Compared with free afatinib and LPs, immuno-LPs exhibited strongly enhanced drug delivery and antitumor efficacy in an NSCLC xenograft model, with stronger tumor selectivity and potentially fewer side-effects. Hence, EGFR-targeting immuno-LPs appear to be promising for NSCLC treatment.

AB The objective of current study was to develop solid lipid nanoparticles-loaded with simvastatin (SIM-SLNs) and investigate their in vivo anti-hyperlipidemic activity in poloxamer-induced hyperlipidemia model. Nano-template engineering technique was used to prepare SIM-SLNs with palmityl alcohol as lipid core and a mixture of Tween 40/Span 40/Myrj 52 to stabilize the core. The prepared SIM-SLNs were evaluated for physicochemical parameters including particle diameter, surface charge, morphology, incorporation efficiency, thermal behaviour and crystallinity. In vitro release profile of SIM-SLNs in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids was evaluated by using dialysis bag technique and anti-hyperlipidemic activity was assessed in hyperlipidemia rat model. SIMSLNs revealed uniform particle size with spherical morphology, zeta potential of -24.9 mV and high incorporation efficiency (similar to 85%). Thermal behaviour and crystallinity studies demonstrated successful incorporation of SIM in the lipid core and its conversion to amorphous form. SIM-SLNs demonstrated a sustained SIM release from the lipid core of nanoparticles. SIM-SLNs significantly reduced the elevated serum lipids as indicated by similar to 3.9 and similar to 1.5-times decreased total cholesterol compared to those of untreated control and SIM dispersion treated hyperlipidemic rats. In conclusion, SIM-SLNs showed a great promise for improving the therapeutic outcomes of SIM via its effective oral delivery.

AB Systemic administration of antifungal agents for the treatment of pulmonary aspergillosis is limited by the poor lung deposition and severe adverse effects. In contrast, pulmonary delivery allows a higher amount of drug to be delivered directly to the infection site and therefore a lower dose is required. This study aimed to develop porous and inhalable voriconazole dry powder with good lung deposition by spray freeze drying (SFD), using tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) as a co-solvent. A three-factor two-level full factorial design approach was used to investigate the effect of total solute concentration, drug content and co-solvent composition on the aerosol performance of the SFD powder. In general, the SFD voriconazole powder exhibited porous and spherical structure, and displayed crystalline characteristics. The analysis of factorial design indicated that voriconazole content was the most significant variable that could influence the aerosol performance of the SFD powders. The formulations that contained a high voriconazole content (40% w/w) and high TBA concentration in the feed solution (70% v/v) displayed the highest fine particle fraction of over 40% in the Next Generation Impactor study in which the powder was dispersed with a Breezhaler (R) at 100 L/min. In addition, the fine particle dose of the SFD powder showed a faster dissolution rate when compared to the unformulated voriconazole. Intratracheal administration of SFD voriconazole powder to mice resulted in a substantially higher drug concentration in the lungs when comparing to the group that received an equivalent dose of liquid voriconazole formulation intravenously, while a clinically relevant plasma drug concentration was maintained for at least two hours. Overall, an inhalable voriconazole dry powder formulation exhibiting good aerosol property and lung deposition was developed with clinical translation potential.

AB Fibrous films have attracted considerable attention in the field of drug delivery and wound dressings owing to their porous structure and highly aligned fiber orientation. However, current fabrication methods such as electrospinning have certain limitations, including high voltage requirement and conductivity dependency. This has greatly hindered the product development and applications of fibrous films. The objective of the present study was to develop a high throughput and solventless fiber fabrication method via centrifugal melt spinning (CMS) technology. A mechanistic study on the rapid fabrication of drug-loaded fibrous films was conducted using different model drugs and polymers. It was observed that the formability, morphology, and yield of fibrous films were affected by melt rheological properties of film components, operation temperature, and plasticizers. Maintaining suitable fluidity of molten materials during the CMS process is critical for the fiber formation. The produced fibrous films had high drug loading, highly aligned orientation and modulatable drug dissolution characteristics. Finally, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to simulate the melt flow fields during the CMS process. Pressure, turbulence, velocity, and partial pathlines were simulated to elucidate the influence of various operation parameters (i.e. rotating speed, inlet rate and collecting radius) and material properties (i.e. density and viscosity) on the outlet velocity of products and sample collection position. The present study demonstrated that CMS is a high throughput and cost-efficient fabrication method for drug-loaded fibrous films. CFD simulation can be used to assist in understanding fiber formation as well as optimization of CMS process parameters.

AB Identification of long-term stable biopharmaceutical formulations is essential for biopharmaceutical product development. Reduction of the number of long-term storage experiments and a well-defined formulation search space requires knowledge-based formulation screenings and a detailed protein phase behavior understanding. To achieve this, short-term analytical techniques can serve as predictors for long-term protein phase behavior. Protein phase behavior studies that investigate this concept commonly display shortcomings such as limited and small datasets, sample adjustments, or simplistic data analysis. To overcome these shortcomings, 150 unique lysozyme solutions were analyzed using six different short-term analytical techniques. Lysozyme's structural properties, conformational stability, colloidal stability, surface charge, and surface hydrophobicity were obtained directly after formulation preparation. Employing the empirical phase diagram method, this short-term data was correlated to long-term physical stability data obtained during 40 days of storage. Short-term protein properties showed partial correlation to long-term phase behavior. Structural differences, changing surface properties, colloidal stability, and conformation stability as a function of formulation conditions were observed. This study contributes to long-term protein phase behavior research by presenting a systematic, data-dependent, and multidimensional data evaluation workflow to create a comprehensive overview of short-term protein analytics in relation to long-term protein phase behavior.

AB Hydrogels-based systems (HBSs) for drug delivery are nowadays extensively used and the interest in modeling their behavior is dramatically increasing. In this review a critical overview on the modeling approaches is given, quantitatively and qualitatively analyzing the publications on the subject, the trend of the publications per year and the type of modeling approaches. It was found that, despite the drug release fitting models (i.e. Higuchi's equation) are the most abundant, their use for HBSs is decreasing in the last years and luckily, considering the limiting assumption on which they were built, they will be confined to simple mathematical fitting equations. Within the mechanistic models the "multi-component" with the swelling approximation (mass transport only) and with the mechanics (fully coupled) are experiencing the highest growth rate, with much more interest toward the last one that, in the next years could be able to provide a first principles model. Statistical models, especially based on the response surface methodology, are rapidly spreading in the scientific community mainly thanks to their ability to be predictive, regardless of the phenomenology, in the analyzed design space with very low efforts. Neural Networks models for HBSs, in countertrend with their use in the pharmaceutical industry, have never take off preferring less data demanding statistical models.

AB Combination therapy is a promising treatment for certain advanced drug-resistant cancers. Although effective inhibition of various tumor cells was reported in vitro, combination treatment requires improvement in vivo due to uncontrolled ratiometric delivery. In this study, a tumor-targeting lipodisk nanoparticle formulation was developed for ratiometric loading and the transportation of two hydrophobic model drugs, doxorubicin (DOX) and paclitaxel (PTX), in one single platform. Furthermore, a slightly acidic pH-sensitive peptide (SAPSP) in-corporated into lipodisks effectively enhanced the tumor-targeting and cell internalization. The obtained coloaded lipodisks were approximately 30 nm with a pH-sensitive property. The ratiometric co-delivery of two drugs via lipodisks was confirmed in both the drug-resistant MCF-7/ADR cell line and its parental MCF-7 cell line in vitro, as well as in a tumor-bearing mouse model in vivo compared with a cocktail solution of free drugs. Co-loaded lipodisks exerted improved cytotoxicity to tumor cells in culture, particularly to drug-resistant tumor cells at synergistic drug ratios. In an in vivo xenograft mouse model, the anti-tumor ability of co-loaded lipodisks was evidenced by the remarkable inhibitory effect on tumor growth of either MCF-7 or MCF-7/ADR tumors, which may be attributed to the increased and ratiometric accumulation of both drugs in the tumor tissues. Therefore, tumor-specific lipodisks were crucial for the combination treatment of DOX and PTX to completely exert a synergistic anti-cancer effect. It is concluded that for co-loaded lipodisks, cytotoxicity data in vitro could be used to predict their inhibitory activity in vivo, potentially enhancing the clinical outcome of synergistic therapy.

AB There is an increasing demand for new lipidic biocompatible and safe materials for self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS). The present work reports the synthesis, characterization, oral mucosal irritation study, and application of novel erucic acid ester of G(0) -PETIM dendron based bicephalous heterolipid (BHL) as an oil phase in SMEDDS using Efavirenz (EFA), a BCS class II drug with poor water solubility and poor bioavailability. Studies were conducted to optimize EFA SMEDDS using different ratios of the BHL as oil phase and surfactant: co-surfactant weight ratios (Km). At Km (1.5), the microemulsion was spontaneously formed in water with mean globule size of 22.78 +/- 0.25 nm and polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.23 +/- 0.031 with high drug loading efficiency of 80.35 +/- 3.1%. Standard stability tests were performed on EFA SMEDDS and the results indicated it to be highly stable. The in vitro dissolution profile of EFA SMEDDS showed > 95% of the drug release within an hour and expectedly substantial enhancement in in vivo bioavailability was observed; almost 6-fold increase in bioavailability with parameters C-max 5.2 mu g/mL, T-max 3 h, and AUC((0-infinity)) 23.48 mu g/h/mL respectively as compared the plain suspension of the drug. In conclusion, the BHL can be used effectively as an oil phase in SMEDDS to enhance solubility and bioavailability of BCS Class II drugs. Further, it holds, in general, a great promise as a new excipient for solubility and bioavailability enhancements.

AB The present investigation highlights the development of D-alpha-Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (Tocophersolan; TPGS) stabilized lipid nanocapsules for enhancing the oral bioavailability and permeability of curcumin (CUR). Lipid nanocapsules were optimized for different lipids, different concentrations of TPGS and different drug: lipid ratio and were further lyophilized. Subsequently, they were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, Transmission electron microscopy and also evaluated for in vitro release study, Caco-2 cell uptake study, ex vivo intestinal permeability and in vivo pharmacokinetic performance. Optimized lipid nanocapsules exhibited desirable quality attributes (average particle size of 190 nm, polydispersity index of 0.240 and average % entrapment efficiency of 51.06 +/- 7.27) employing Maisine (TM) 35-1 as a lipid carrier, 0.05% TPGS and CUR: lipid ratio of 5:10 and showed sustained release biphasic pattern. They showcased excellent stability in simulated gastrointestinal fluids and storage stability. The CUR nanocapsules exhibited similar to 14-fold higher Caco-2 cell uptake and similar to 12.8-fold increased ex vivo intestinal permeability. Also, the AUC of CUR nanocapsules in Sprague Dawley rats was increased by similar to 12 folds and MRT similar to 2.47-folds as compared to aqueous CUR suspension. Thus, lipid nanocapsules possessed a positive impact on improving the permeability and oral bioavailability of CUR.

AB Cyclodextrins (CDs) are oligosaccharides that self-assemble in aqueous solutions to form transient clusters, nanoparticles and small microparticles. The critical aggregation concentration (cac) of the natural alpha CD, beta CD and gamma CD in pure aqueous solutions was estimated to be 25, 8 and 9 mg/ml, respectively. The cac of 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP beta CD), that consists of mixture of isomers, was estimated to be significantly higher or 118 mg/ml. Addition of chaotropic agents (i.e. that disrupts non-covalent bonds such as hydrogen bonds) to the aqueous media increases the cac. Formation of drug/CD complexes can increase or decrease the cac. Due to the transient nature of the CD clusters and nanoparticles they can be difficult to detect and their presence is frequently ignored. However, they have profound effect on the physiochemical properties of CDs and their pharmaceutical applications. For example, the values of stability constants of drug/CD complexes can be both concentration dependent and method dependent. Like in the case of micelles water-soluble polymers can enhance the solubilizing effect of CDs. Also, formation of drug/CD complex nanoparticles appears to increase the ability of CDs to enhance drug delivery through some mucosal membranes.

AB Mucoadhesive olaminosomes are novel nanocarriers designed to control agomelatine release and enhance its bioavailability. Olaminosomes were prepared using oleic acid, oleylamine and sorbitan monooleate adopting thin film hydration technique. Chitosan HCl was added to impart the mucoadhesive properties to the olaminosomes. Mucoadhesive olaminosomes were characterized for their particle size, in-vitro drug release and irritation potentiality in rabbit eyes. The reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) through 8 h in male New Zealand Albino rabbits was measured after administration of the selected formulations. Histopathological changes in rabbits' eye were also evaluated. Results revealed that increasing the amount of the added oleylamine decreased the particle size of the resulted vesicles and increased the drug release rate. Olaminosomes showed enhanced drug absorption, hence more reduction in IOP was observed. Moreover, using chitosan HCl might increase the residence time of the formulation in the eye and hence improved the absorption of the drug. No histopathological changes in rabbits' eye were detected after the application of mucoadhesive olaminosomes concluding their safety on the ocular tissues. In conclusion, mucoadhesive olaminosomes succeeded in enhancing agomelatine bioavailability in rabbits' eyes confirming the development of a novel ocular nanocarrier for insoluble drugs.

AB Liposomes have emerged as a fascinating nanocarriers for the delivery of cancer therapeutics. However, their efficacy for cancer therapy is reduced partially because of the serum-instability and incomplete drug release. In this study, a novel disulfide cross-linked liposomes (CLs) assembled from dimeric lipoic acid-derived glycerophosphorylcholine (di-LA-PC) conjugate was developed. The conjugate was synthesized by a facial esterificafion of lipoic acid (LA) and glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC) and characterized by MS, H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR. Featuring the enhanced serum-stability and intracellular drug release determined by in vitro stability and GSHresponsive behavior, CLs prepared with dried thin film technique following 10 % dithiothreitol (DTT) crosslinking can attain effective delivery of anticancer candidates. Notably, CLs stably encapsulated doxorubicin (Dox) in their vesicular structures and showed a remarkable thiol-sensitive release of payload upon cellular uptake by cancer cells, compared to that of uncross-linked liposomes (uCLs) or Doxil-like liposome (DLLs). The cell viability and apoptosis of Dox-loaded CLs worked the pronounced cytotoxic effects to MCF-7 cells with an IC50 value of 10.8 mu g Dox equiv./mL comparable to free Dox and 2.8-fold higher than DLLs. More importantly, it is demonstrated that the nanoscale characteristics of Dox-loaded CLs could prevent the proliferation of adriamycin-resistant MCF-7/ADR cell line, highlighting their potential in reversal of drug resistance. Furthermore, the preliminary in vivo test (n = 3) showed that disulfide cross-linked liposomal formulation of Dox (Dox-CLs) improved the therapeutic efficacy compared to free Dox and DLLs in a human breast carcinoma xenograft mouse model. Therefore, the current thiol-responsive cross-linked liposome may provide a robust drug delivery platform for cancer therapy.

AB Process analytical technology (PAT) has become an important factor in design, analysis and control of complex technological processes. In the present study, pellet coating process was monitored using four different PAT approaches, i.e. near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, in-line image analysis, and spatial filtering technique (SFT). Robustness and accuracy of a novel in-line image analyser was studied during the active ingredient coating process on the pilot scale in the first part of the study. In the second part, multivariate model for in-line monitoring of critical quality attributes, such as moisture content and coating thickness, was calibrated with off-line NIR measurements of laboratory scale samples. The quality of the model was evaluated during the pilot scale batches. In the last part of the study, applicability of two different Raman process analysers for real time moisture content and coating quantity determination was investigated extensively. In addition, Raman spectral data was correlated with the in-line SFT measurements. The results and their interpretations present novel aspects of multiple process analysing techniques, which could help improve pellet coating process monitoring and control. Moreover, presented multivariate model calibration approaches could significantly reduce time, costs, and effort needed to implement PAT into the pharmaceutical industry.

AB Studies have shown that the N-terminus and lysine side residue of peptides are prone to acylation in poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres. Peptides such as leuprorelin lack a free N-terminus or lysine and only contain serine, arginine, and tyrosine as nucleophilic residues. The purpose of this study was to detect potential acylation impurities and determine their corresponding acylation sites in commercial leuprorelin-loaded PLGA microspheres. Commercial samples from three vendors were selected as targets for our study. The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) conditions of the European Pharmacopoeia were used to separate and collect impurities. HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was applied to confirm both the structure and acylation sites of the impurities. Our study demonstrated that impurities originating from both degradation of microspheres and synthesis of leuprorelin were well separated and identified using these HPLC conditions. HPLC-MS/MS analysis of acylated leuprorelin showed that diglycoyl, lactoyl-glycoyl, dilactoyl, and monolactoyl groups were conjugated to serine in leuprorelin-loaded PLGA microspheres. This is the first report showing serine to be the acylation site in peptide-loaded PLGA microspheres. Separation and identification of acylated leuprorelin derivatives will assist in minimising acylation and guiding the development of quality control for commercial leuprorelin-loaded PLGA microspheres.

AB Since the application of chitosan magnetic cationic microspheres in brain drug delivery by Gallo in 1993, chitosan has been extensively studied in brain drug delivery. As the only natural alkaline polysaccharide with good biocompatibility and biodegradability, chitosan prepared nanoparticles which use chitosan as carrier material to encapsulate drug have been proved with advantages of protecting from enzyme degradation, control release and improved bioavailability. Besides, chitosan can enhance drug permeability across the blood-brain barrier by affecting the tight junction. And with positive charge on the surface, chitosan nanoparticles can absorb on the negatively charged cell membrane, thus increase its residence time on the nasal mucosa and benefit of the delivery of drugs from the nasal cavity to the brain. All these properties made chitosan nanoparticles especially suitable for brain delivery. What's more, the free amino groups on the surface of chitosan nanoparticles allow specific chemical modification to form a wide range of chitosan derivatives. Surface modification of the nanoparticles with tumor targeting peptides like chlorotoxin and transferrin, can further improve the targeting property to brain tumor. This article gives a comprehensive review on the advantages and recent progresses in the treatment of brain disease by chitosan nanoparticles.

AB The present work proposes a novel application of EPSA (not an acronym but found to be referred to by many as Exposed Polar Surface Area), a supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) polarity readout for assisting in the prediction of the extent of drug permeation through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). For this purpose, EPSA values for 69 structurally unrelated acidic, basic, neutral and amphoteric compounds were determined by a validated SFC method. Additionally, water-accessible surface area (WASA) values for the whole dataset were calculated in silico and compared to experimentally determined EPSA values. All these indexes were used to model the uptake of drugs through the BBB. Highly significant statistical models (r(2)(n-1) = 0.81) were achieved by using WASA and/or EPSA values along with other experimentally determined (e.g. phospholipophilicity) and in silico calculated descriptors.

AB The present study aimed to investigate in vitro DNA transfection efficiency of three novel chitosan derivatives: thiolated trimethyl chitosan (TMC-Cys), methylated 4-N,N dimethyl aminobenzyl N,O carboxymethyl chitosan (MABCC) and thiolated trimethyl aminobenzyl chitosan(MABC-Cys). After polymer synthesis and characterization, nanoparticles were prepared using these polymers and their size, zeta potential and DNA condensing ability were measured. After that, cytotoxicity and transfection efficiency of nanocomplexes were carried out in three different cells. The results showed that all polymers could condense DNA plasmid strongly from N/P 2 and nanocomplexes had eligible sizes and zeta potentials. Moreover, the nanocomplexes had negligible cytotoxicity and MABC-Cys was the most effective vehicle for gene delivery in HEK-293T cells. In the two other cell lines, SKOV-3 and MCF-7, TMC-Cys exhibited the highest transfection efficiency. This study indicated that chemical structure of these novel chitosan derivatives in the interaction with the cell type can lead to successful gene delivery.

AB Age and comorbidities can impact on the success of handling an inhaler. In this pilot study, we assessed finger strength in 62 participants (aged 5-17 years [n = 20], 18-65 years [n = 22] and > 65 years [n = 20]) by using different types of inhalers with integrated sensors (Respimat (R), Breezhaler (R), Aerolizer (R), Genuair (R), Diskus (R), Ellipta (R), HandiHaler (R), Turbohaler (R) and a pressurized metered-dose inhaler [Atrovent (R)]). Parameters under investigation included the spontaneous and maximum achievable force and torque required to operate devices. Satisfaction with individual inhalers, and the relationship between satisfaction and strength, were also assessed. There was a marked difference in the compressive force required to operate individual inhalers, with maximum values ranging between 0.7 N and 39 N. Finger strength differed considerably between age groups, and participants with rheumatic disease showed different preferences and experienced more difficulties compared with healthy subjects. Satisfaction between devices was highly variable, and influenced by comorbidities and the ability to understand user instructions. Our findings suggest that individual patient's circumstances need to be considered when prescribing an inhaler and may help in the development of future devices, leading to design options with increased ease of operation.

AB Blend uniformity was monitored throughout a continuous manufacturing (CM) process by near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic measurements of flowing blends and compared to the drug concentration in the tablets. The NIR spectra were obtained through the chute after the blender and within the feed frame, while transmission spectra were obtained for the tablets. The CM process was performed with semi-fine acetaminophen blends at 10.0% (w/w). The blender was operated at 250 RPM, for best performance, and 106 and 495 rpm where a lower mixing efficiency was expected. The variation in blender RPM increased the variation in drug concentration at the chute but not at the feed frame. Statistical results show that the drug concentration of tablets can be predicted, with great accuracy, from blends within the feed frame. This study demonstrated a mixing effect within the feed frame, which contribute to a 60% decrease in the relative standard deviation of the drug concentration, when compared to the chute. Variographic analysis showed that the minimum sampling and analytical error was five times less in the feed frame than the chute. This study demonstrates that the feed frame is an ideal location for monitoring the drug concentration of powder blends for CM processes.

AB Astaxanthin and alpha-tocopherol have various biological potential with induction of intracellular ROS production in cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial site. The present study was performed to prepare nanoemulsion (NEs) formulation of astaxanthin and alpha-tocopherol with sodium caseinate (AS-AT/SC NEs) using spontaneous emulsification and ultrasonication for analyzing intracellular ROS production in apoptosis. NEs was characterized with standard analysis, which revealed a high stability of normal pH with a small size and unique zeta potential of spherical structure droplets with no toxicity and faster cell migration. It induced ROS production and confirmed using fluorescent stains due to their unique physicochemical and functional properties. Therefore, it played a significant role in the induction of oxidative stress inside the cell as dose-dependent cytotoxicity at different concentrations. AS-AT/SC NEs with protective effect in maintaining intracellular ROS, oxidative stress and mitochondrial membrane potential to reduced apoptosis morphology in cancer cells through mitochondria-mediated apoptosis that inhibits cell death, thus cell survival was initiated at greater extent. Thereby exhibiting a significant remarkable therapeutic effect in cancer field. To best of our knowledge, this is first study concluded that induction of apoptosis potential by AS-AT/SC NEs emerged as a potential way to eradicate cancer cells.

AB The use of nanoparticles as drug carriers in the field of skeletal muscle diseases has been poorly addressed and the interaction of nanoparticles with skeletal muscle cells has been investigated almost exclusively on C2C12 murine myoblasts. In this study we investigated the effects poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles, mesoporous silica nanoparticles and liposomes, on the viability of primary human myoblasts and analyzed their cellular uptake and intracellular distribution in both primary human myoblasts and myotubes. Our data demonstrate that poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles do not negatively affect myoblasts viability, contrarily to mesoporous silica nanoparticles and liposomes that induce a decrease in cell viability at the highest doses and longest incubation time. Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles and mesoporous silica nanoparticles are internalized by endocytosis, poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles undergo endosomal escape whereas mesoporous silica nanoparticles always occur within vacuoles. Liposomes were rarely observed within the cells. The uptake of all tested nanoparticles was less prominent in primary human myotubes as compared to myoblasts.
   Our findings represent the first step toward the characterization of the interaction between nanoparticles and primary human muscle cells and suggest that poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles might find an application for drug delivery to skeletal muscle.

AB Solution pH is an important factor during drug formulation and processing. Changes in pH present challenges. Regulation of pH is typically managed by using a buffer system, which must have a suitable pK(a). The pK(a) of buffers depends on temperature, pressure and ionic strength. In addition, the pK(a) can also be affected by the polarity of the solvent, e.g., by the addition of a co-solvent. Theoretical considerations and accessible experimental data were used to understand how the pK(a) values of pharmaceutically relevant buffers depend on these factors. Changes in temperature also affect the buffer pK(a). Carboxylic acid moieties were least affected by changes in temperature. Buffers containing amino groups were most affected by changes in temperature, and the pK(a) decreased as temperature was increased. It was possible to predict accurately how buffer pK(a) varies with temperature, based on changes in enthalpy and heat capacity for the ionization reactions. Changes in pressure had a limited effect on buffer pK(a) for pressures < 100 MPa. At higher pressures, buffer pK(a) varied by up to 0.5 pH units. Altering the ionic strength or polarity of the solvent influenced buffer pK(a) slightly. However, it is possible to keep both the ionic strength and the polarity of the solvent constant during drug formulation and processing.

AB In spite of the high incidence of breast cancer worldwide, there are few strategies for its chemoprevention, and they have limited adherence mainly due to their serious adverse effects. As a new approach for local breast cancer chemoprevention, we developed and optimized microemulsions for topical delivery of celecoxib to the breast skin, and evaluated their combination with microneedles to improve drug penetration for localization in the mammary tissue. Microemulsions containing water at 15% (ME-15), 29% (ME-29) and 60% (ME-60) were obtained and characterized. They were isotropic, displayed Newtonian behavior and particle size smaller than 100 nm. ME-15 and ME-29 increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL) compared to ME-60, and displayed stronger vascular toxicity, evidenced by hemorrhage and lysis in HET-CAM assays. ME-60 was more efficacious at increasing celecoxib cutaneous and percutaneous delivery (1.3-4-fold). Increasing the number of microneedle roller applications from 1 to 8 increased the number of skin punctures and TEWL; its association with ME-60 promoted no further increase in TEWL, but improved (1.6-4-fold) celecoxib cutaneous and percutaneous delivery. Microemulsion incorporation reduced celecoxib IC(50)( )in MCF-7 cells (3.3-fold), suggesting that presence of formulation components in the mammary tissue might improve drug cytotoxicity.

AB To face the challenges of oral delivery of peptide and protein (P/P) drugs, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDSs) containing monoacyl phosphatidylcholine (MAPC), Labrasol (LAB) and medium-chain (MC) monoglycerides as permeation enhancers (PEs) were evaluated for their effect on intestinal absorption of insulin.
   In this study, insulin was complexed with phosphatidylcholine (SPC) to form an insulin-SPC complex (ins-SPC) with increased lipophilicity. The following three SEDDSs: MCT(MAPC) (MC triglycerides and MAPC included), MCT(RH40) (MC triglycerides and Kolliphor* RH40 included) and LCT(MAPC) (long-chain triglycerides and MAPC included) were loading with ins-SPC (4% or 8% w/w of SPC). Three SEDDSs generated emulsions with droplet sizes between 50 and 470 nm and with zeta potentials between - 5 to - 25 mV in a simulated intestinal medium. Mucus-secreting Caco-2/HT29-MTX-E12 co-culture and Caco-2 monolayers were used as in vitro cell transport models to investigate insulin permeability. In comparison to insulin HBSS solution, MCT(MAPC) significantly increased the insulin permeability across co-culture and Caco-2 monolayers (2.0-2.5 x 10(-7) cm/s). In an intra-jejunal (i.j.) instillation model in rats, MCT(RH40) significantly decreased the rat blood glucose after 0.5 h by 17.0 +/- 2.5% and for MCT(MAPC), it was 23.6 +/- 10.6%. Furthermore, a lipase inhibitor orlistat was incorporated into MCT(MAPC) to evaluate the effect of lipid digestion on insulin absorption. Results indicated that the incorporation of orlistat did not significantly alter the in vivo insulin absorption. Overall, the SEDDS MCT(MAPC) composed of natural PEs (MAPC and MC glycerides) and synthetic PE (LAB) significantly increased the intestinal absorption of insulin upon i.j. instillation. Although it is not possible to conclude if a single PE is dominating the intestinal absorption of insulin, MCT(MAPC) seems to have the potential for oral insulin delivery.

AB Liposomes are lamellar nanovesicles made of phospholipids of a great interest as drug delivery carriers, able to encapsulate both hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds. Some liposomal formulations have reached the market, including the doxorubicin loaded PEGylated liposomal dispersion Doxil (R) . The aim of the work was to investigate the possibility of concentrating liposomes through the ultrafiltration process under nitrogen pressure, using Doxil (R) formulation as a model. The concentrated liposomal dispersions (4x and 8x) obtained from Doxil (R) were characterised in terms of size evolution (dynamic light scattering), morphology (cryo-TEM) and thermal behaviour (microcalorimetry, mDSC and high-resolution ultrasonic spectroscopy, HR-US) and compared to the unloaded liposomes of the same composition. The ultrafiltration process resulted to be effective in concentrating both loaded and unloaded liposomal dispersions, which showed a particle size and thermal properties comparable to those of the non concentrated ones. Moreover, all liposomal dispersions did not show any remarkable variation in term of particle size distribution and morphology for at least 8 weeks after concentration. Altogether, results demonstrated the effectiveness in using ultrafiltration as a methodology to concentrate both loaded and unloaded liposomes without affecting the quality of the processed product.

AB The use of non-aqueous cellulose-based formulations for extrusion-spheronisation (E-S) is investigated. A 10 wt% hydroxypropyl cellulose/isopropyl alcohol solution (HPC/IPA) was identified as a suitable sticky liquid binder for preparing non-aqueous pastes. Preliminary tests were performed on a series of pastes using a ram as well as a laboratory roller screen extruder, since the former is commonly used in batch testing and the latter replicates the shear range in a manufacturing screen extruder. Pellets with acceptable size and shape distributions were obtained with Avicel (R) HFE-102 NF/HPC/IPA for ram E-S, and with Avicel (R) RC-591/HPC/IPA for screen E-S. Further investigation was performed with calcium carbonate added as a model active pharmaceutical ingredient. Both formulations were able to generate pellets with acceptable size and shape characteristics at up to 50 wt% carbonate loading: further work is required to optimise yields.

AB Recently, various additive manufacturing (3D printing) approaches have been employed to fabricate dressings such as film scaffolds that possess well defined architecture and orientation at the micro level. In this study, crosslinked chitosan (CH) based film matrices were prepared using 3D printing with genipin (GE) as a cross-linker, with glycerol (GLY) and poly ethylene glycol (PEG) as plasticizer. The 3D printed films were functionally characterized using (tensile, fluid handling, mucoadhesion, drug dissolution, morphological properties and cell viability as well physico-chemical characterization using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. CH-GE-PEG600 3D printed films having the ratio of 1:1 polymer: plasticizer was selected due to their appropriate flexibility. Fourier transform infrared results showed intermolecular interaction between CH, GE and PEG which was confirmed by X-ray diffraction showing amorphous matrix structure. In vitro mucoadhesion studies of CH-GE-PEG600 films showed the capability of the 3D printed film to adhere to the epithelial surface. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that the surface of the plasticised films were smooth indicating content uniformity of CH, GE and PEG whilst micro cracks in unplasticised films confirmed their brittle nature. Plasticised films also showed high swelling capacity which enhanced water absorption. Cytotoxicity (MTT) assay using human skin fibroblast cell lines demonstrated that more than 90% of cells were viable after 48 h confirming non-toxic nature of the 3D printed CH-GE-PEG600 films and therefore promising dressing for chronic wound healing applications.

AB Triglycerides account for 99% of milk fat and play a central role in determining dairy product quality. Many factors influence triglyceride synthesis and milk fat secretion. MicroRNAs have been verified to be involved in numerous biological processes, but little is known about their roles in milk fat biosynthesis. In this study, we aim to explore whether miR-454 could regulate triglyceride synthesis in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs) by targeting PPAR-gamma. A luciferase reporter assay showed that the predicted target site was correct and that miR-454 and PPAR-gamma had a direct interaction. In addition, miR-454 mimics and inhibitors were transfected into BMECs. The results showed that both the mRNA and protein levels of PPAR-gamma were negatively correlated with miR-454 expression. Fat droplet accumulation and triglyceride production were also inversely correlated with miR-454 expression. Our results indicate that miR-454 regulates triglyceride synthesis by directly targeting the PPAR-gamma 3' UTR in BMECs, suggesting that miR-454 could potentially be a new factor to elevate dairy product quality.

AB In human pancreatic beta-cells, oxidative stress and cellular injures can be induced by H2O2 treatment. The KEAPI/NRF2 axis is a key antioxidant signaling pathway. The present study attempted to elucidate the mechanism by which the KEAP1/NRF2 axis mediates oxidative stress-induced death in pancreatic beta-cells. Our data showed that H2O2 treatment obviously induced the apoptosis of beta-cells. Further experiments demonstrated that KEAP1 expression was downregulated in H2O2-treated pancreatic beta-cells and this change correlated with increase in the cellular abundance and nuclear translocation of NRF2. The restoration of KEAP1 expression in cells resulted in a recovery of cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that KEAP1 overexpression negatively regulated the abundance of NRF2, subsequently causing decreased antioxidant response element activation. This led to HO-1 protein downregulation in H2O2-treated human pancreatic beta-cells, which was also observed in NRF2-silenced beta-cells. Conversely, the silencing of KEAP1 led to NRF2 upregulation and inhibited ARE and HO-1 signaling in pancreatic beta-cells. The increase in the abundance of NRF2 following treatment with H2O2 drastically elevated the production of BAX, FAS, FAS-L, CASP-3, and CASP-9, and this change was reversed by KEAP1 overexpression or NRF2 silencing. Taken together, H2O2 treatment activated KEAP1/NRF2 signaling to promote the production of pro-apoptotic factors and consequently led to the apoptosis of human pancreatic beta-cells.

AB Background and aims: A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) reported an association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11196288 and risk of early-onset large artery atherosclerotic (LAA) stroke in European population. The interaction between genetic and environmental factors such as age has also received increasing attention. We performed this study to investigate the association between the rs11196288A > G polymorphism and LAA stroke risk in the Chinese Han population and test whether age interacts rs11196288 to influence LAA stroke risk.
   Methods: Genotyping of rs11196288 was performed in 1066 LAA stroke patients and 1167 healthy controls. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to assess the effect of the rs11196288A > G polymorphism on susceptibility and short-term outcome of LAA stroke. Nomograms were performed to estimate probability of risk for an individual patient.
   Results: A significant decrement of LAA stroke risk was found in co-dominant (AG vs. AA, OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.64-0.91, P = 0.003; GG vs. AA, OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.50-0.85, P = 0.002), dominant (AG/GG vs. AA, OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.62-0.87, P < 0.001) and recessive models (GG vs. AA/AG, OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.59-0.97, P = 0.028) of rs11196288. However, the interaction between age and genotypes of rs11196288 was not statistically significant, and no significant association was observed between the rs11196288A > G polymorphism and short-term outcome of LAA stroke (P > 0.05).
   Conclusions: In the southeastern Chinese population, the rs11196288A > G polymorphism is associated with decreased risk of LAA stroke.

AB Pig is a useful medical model for humans due to its similarity in size and physiology. Skeletal muscle plays an essential role in body movement. However, the skeletal muscle injuries are common. Skeletal muscle function maintenance largely depends on preserving the regenerative capacity of muscle. Muscle satellite cells proliferation plays an essential role in postnatal muscle growth and regeneration. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms associated with muscle satellite cells proliferation is essential for devising the alternative treatments for muscle injury. Previous studies showed JAG1-Notch1 signaling pathway and miRNAs regulate the skeletal muscle development. JAG1-Notch1 signal pathway regulates the transcription of certain types of miRNAs which further affects target gene expression. However, the specific relationship between JAG1-Notch1 signal pathway and miRNAs during muscle development has not been established. We found overexpression of intracellular domain of the Notch1 protein (N1 ICD) in porcine muscle satellite cells (PSCs) decreased miR-199b level. We demonstrated that miR-199b inhibits PSCs proliferation using the overexpression and inhibition of miR-199b experiment. We also found JAG1, the miR-199b target gene, promotes PSCs proliferation through activating the Notch1 signal pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrated miR-199b forms a feedback loop with the JAG1-Notch1 signal pathway to maintain the PSCs niche homeostasis. Our results of miRNAs and genes work collaboratively in regulating PSCs proliferation expand our understanding in PSCs proliferation mechanism. Furthermore, this finding indicates miR-199b is a potential therapeutic target for muscle atrophy.

AB Sucrose non-fermenting-1 (SNF1) -related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1) is a key regulator of catabolic homeostasis and plays critical roles in plant development and stress response. In this study, three SNF1 -related protein kinase 1 genes, ZmSnRK1.1, ZmSnRK1.2 and ZmSnRK1.3, which are highly conserved in plants, were isolated from maize (Zea mays L.). Expression profiling experiments indicated that the three genes were constitutively expressed in all tested tissues with the highest expression level in young ears. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that ZmSnRK1.1, ZmSnRK1.2 and ZmSnRK1.3 are localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing ZmSnRK1.1, ZmSnRK1.2 or ZmSnRK1.3 exhibited hypersensitivity to exogenous sugar treatment and accumulated less glucose but more sucrose in the rosette leaves and mature seeds compared to the wild type. Time to flowering was shortened in the ZmSnRK1.1 over-expressing lines but prolonged in the ZmSnRK1.2 and ZmSnRK1.3 lines. Leaf senescence was delayed in all transgenic lines, especially in the ZmSnRK1.3 lines, which led to enhanced biomass and seed yield at maturity. Key genes that are involved in carbon metabolism, senescence and flowering time were differentially regulated in the transgenic lines as revealed by the RNA-seq analysis. This study demonstrated that maize ZmSnRK1 members play important roles in energy sensing and carbon metabolism, they regulate the architecture shaping and developmental transition when heterogeneously expressed in Arabidopsis and may provide potentially valuable characteristics for high yield breeding of crops in the future.

AB Myosins are a large family of actin filament-based motor proteins with a broad range of functions such as intracellular membrane trafficking, endocytosis, exocytosis, organellar transport, growth cone motility, cytokinesis, and cell locomotion. They are found in many organisms from fungi to humans. The myosin gene family in Bombyx mori is poorly studied, even though the molecular functions of these genes in vertebrates and insects, such as Drosophila, are well known. We identified 16 myosin genes from B. mori and identified the myosin genes in 12 vertebrates, eight insects, three nematodes, and seven protozoa. The number of myosin genes in vertebrates is double the number in invertebrates. The number of myosin isoforms in classes I and II is larger in vertebrates compared to invertebrates. B. mori myosin genes can be classified into 11 classes. Compared to B. mori, some myosin classes are not present in other insects. Classes I, II, XVIII, and XXI appear to be important for insect survival because they are conserved among nine insects. The relatively large sizes of B. mori myosin genes are due to their longer introns. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis demonstrated that many B. mori myosin genes have tissue-specific expression and exhibit temporal specific activity during metamorphosis. These data provide insights into evolutionary and functional aspects of B. mori myosin genes that could be useful for the study of homologous myosins in other Lepidoptera species.

AB During gametogenesis and embryonic development, precise regulation of gene expression, across cell/tissue types and over time, is crucial. In vertebrates, transcription is partly regulated by histone lysine acetylation/deacetylation, an epigenetic mechanism mediated by lysine acetyltransferases (KAT) and histone deacetylases (HDAC). Well characterized in mammals, these enzymes are unknown in fish embryology outside of zebrafish development. Here, we characterized putative KAT and HDAC enzymes in the self-fertilizing mangrove rivulus fish, Kryptolebias marmoratus, a species that naturally self-fertilizes and can produce isogenic lineages. This unique feature provides an opportunity to elucidate the role of epigenetic mechanisms as a source of phenotypic plasticity. In this study, twenty-seven KAT and seventeen HDAC genes have been identified. Their conserved domains and their phylogenetic analysis suggest conservation of the enzymes' activity in our species, relative to other vertebrates in which the enzymes have been characterized. Furthermore, the dynamics of KAT and HDAC mRNA expression during embryogenesis, in adult gonads and brains, argues for a putative biological function in early and late development as well as in male/hermaphrodite gametogenesis and adult neurogenesis. Our study aimed to provide a basis about the epigenetic actors putatively regulating histone acetylation in a self-fertilizing fish, the mangrove rivulus. Unique among vertebrates, the great number of isogenic lineages occurring naturally in this species allows exploring the contribution of the enzymes regulating histone acetylation only to reproduction and development in teleost fishes, which are very powerful models in fundamental and applied researches that include aquaculture, ecotoxicology, behaviour, evolution, sexual determinism and human diseases.

AB Background: Chemoresistance to cisplatin in lung cancer treatment remains prevalent. Since targeting excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1) may be a viable strategy to reestablish the therapeutic sensitivity to platinum-based agents in chemoresistant cases, and low ERCC1 level is beneficial to metastatic lung cancer patients undergoing platinum-based chemotherapy, we hypothesized that metastasis-associated process is involved in ERCC1-dependent cisplatin-resistance in lung adenocarcinoma.
   Methods: We performed an RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis to identify differentially expressed genes in ERCC1-deficient cells co-treated with cisplatin and sodium glycididazole (CMNa). Differentially expressed genes and the hub genes in the cisplatin/CMNa-treated cells were identified by systematic network analysis. Oncomine expression analysis was also performed to evaluate the clinical implication of the identified hub gene.
   Results: Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF/PDGFR) and focal adhesion genes were downregulated in ERCC1-defective non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells undergoing combined cisplatin/CMNa treatment. Consistent with the finding, cell migration was reduced in these cells. PDGFRB was identified as the hub gene in the process by differential expressed gene network analysis. Importantly, elevated PDGFRB level was observed in advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients with metastases.
   Conclusion: PDGF/PDGFR and focal adhesion signaling may serve as another mechanism in addition to ERCC1-mediated cisplatin-resistance in lung adenocarcinoma. Multiple pro-invasion/pro-migration/proliferation and DNA damage repair pathways may be integrated to confer growth advantages on tumor cells.

AB Drought is a common environmental factor that limits plant growth, development and productivity. To understand the effect of drought on the perennial grass Bothriochloa ischaemum, we applied high-throughput Illumina sequencing technology and analyzed the transcriptional expression profile of Bothriochloa ischaemum leaves and roots under drought and normal growth conditions. Compared to the controls, drought-treated samples had 7989 differentially expressed genes in leaves and 15,675 differentially expressed genes in roots. Of these, 4489 and 5010 genes were up-regulated genes in leaves and roots, respectively. Of the 2012 differentially expressed genes that were shared between leaves and roots, 1068 were up-regulated. We identified common and distinct biological processes and metabolic pathways involved in drought stress between the two tissues. Most notably, there was a dramatic up-regulation of genes involved in plant hormone signal transduction especially ABA signal transduction components and flavonoid biosynthesis enzymes or regulation factors in drought stress treated leaves. Therefore, these two cellular processes likely confer resistance to drought stress in Bothriochloa ischaemum. Overall, our findings provided new insights into a mechanism involving the synergistic interaction between ABA signaling and secondary metabolism during the drought adaptation of Bothriochloa ischaemum.

AB Hepatitis B virus X (HBx), a viral onco-protein encoded by HBV, can promote oncogenesis of HCC. However, the mechanism of HBx in hepatocarcinogenesis is still unclear. In this study, we establish a new mouse model with normal immune system to investigate the role of HBx and its functional mechanisms under normal immune function. The animal model was established by injecting HBx-EGFP-14-19 cells into the hepatic portal vein of KM mice. To verify the mouse model, the expression of HBx in the liver tissue of mice was detected by qRT-PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The apoptosis index was calculated using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and the expression levels of apoptosis-related and cell cycle-related factors were measured. Moreover, expression of proteins in the protein kinase B/mam-malian target of rapamycin (Akt/mTOR) signaling pathway was detected in HBx-EGFP-14-19 mice with and without use of an Akt inhibitor. The results showed the HBx was successfully overexpressed in liver of KM mice. After overexpressing HBx, the apoptosis index was downregulated in HBx-EGFP-14-19 liver tissue, and the expression levels of caspase-9 and Bad were reduced, but Bcl-xl was increased in HBx-EGFP-14-19 liver tissue. Overexpression of HBx increased the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), cyclinD1 and cyclinE. Moreover, compared with the low-level HBx group, p-Akt and p-mTOR were increased in the livers of mice with high levels of HBx. However, inactivation of apoptosis by overexpression of HBx was abolished by the treatment with an Akt inhibitor. These results indicate that HBx can induce anti-apoptosis mechanisms in hepatocytes in vivo, which is mediated by the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.

AB Vriesea carinata is an endemic bromeliad from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. It has trichome and tank system in their leaves which allows to absorb water and nutrients. It belongs to Bromeliaceae family, which includes several species highly enriched of cysteine-proteases (CysPs). These proteolytic enzymes regulate processes as senescence, cell differentiation, pathogen-linked programmed cell death and mobilization of proteins. Although, their biological importance, there are not genomic resources in V. carinata that can help to identify and understand their molecular mechanisms involved in different biological processes. Thus high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of V. carinata is necessary to generate sequences for the purpose of gene discovery and functional genomic studies. In the present study, we sequenced and assembled the V. carinata transcriptome to the identification of CysPs. A total of 43,232 contigs were assembled for the leaf tissue. BLAST analysis indicated that 23,803 contigs exhibited similarity to non-redundant Viridiplantae proteins. 28.24% of the contigs were classified into the COG database, and gene ontology categorized them into 61 functional groups. A metabolic pathway analysis with KEGG revealed 9679 contigs assigned to 31 metabolic pathways. Among 16 full-length CysPs identified, 11 were evaluated in respect to their expression patterns in the leaf apex, base and inflorescence tissues. The results showed differential expression levels of legumain, metacaspase, pyroglutamyl and papain-like CysPs depending of the leaf region. These results provide a global overview of V. carinata gene functions and expression activities of CysPs in those tissues.

AB Myotubularin-related protein 14 (MTMR14) is a member of the myotubularin (MTM)-related protein family and plays a key role in cardiomyopathy and autophagy. However, its potential implication in human cancer is unclear. In this study, we have investigated the expression profile of MTMR14 and its functional impact in liver cancer for the first time. Expression analysis by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that MTMR14 expression is obviously overexpressed in liver cancer, and positively correlated with clinical stage. A loss-of-function study showed that knockdown of MTMR14 promotes cell apoptosis and inhibits cell migration. MTMR14 knockdown also inhibits tumor migration in vivo in liver cancer peritoneal implantation nude mouse model. A molecular mechanistic study by western blot showed that Knockdown MTMR14 causes downregulation of N-cadherin and E-cadherin, and promotes the cleavage and activation of caspase12, caspase9 and caspase3, but excluding caspase8. These results suggest that MTMR14 affects cell migration through N-cadherin and E-cadherin. Additionally, MTMR14 affects cell apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway but not the death receptor pathway. Herein, our results indicate MTMR14 could have an oncogenic role in human liver cancer and thus demonstrates its potential as a target for the diagnosis and/or treatment of liver cancer.

AB Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in plant is a complex process, regulated by many genes and influenced by several factors. In recent years, the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology and advanced statistical analysis such as meta-analysis and computational systems biology have provided novel opportunities to overcome biological complexity. Here, we performed a meta-analysis on publicly available transcriptome datasets of twelve economically significant medicinal plants to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between shoot and root tissues and to find the key molecular features which may be effective in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Meta-analysis identified a total of 880 genes with differential expression between two tissues. Functional enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis indicated that the functions of those DEGs are highly associated with the developmental process, starch metabolic process, response to stimulus, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and phenylalanine metabolism. In addition, systems biology analysis of the DEGs was applied to find protein-protein interaction network and discovery of significant modules. The detected modules were associated with hormone signal transduction, transcription repressor activity, response to light stimulus and epigenetic processes. Finally, analysis was extended to search for putative miRNAs that are associated with DEGs. A total of 31 miRNAs were detected which belonged to 16 conserved families. The present study provides a comprehensive view to better understand the tissue-specific expression of genes and mechanisms involved in secondary metabolites synthesis and may provide candidate genes for future researches to improve yield of secondary metabolites.

AB The identification of Anisakis species in Korean waters was performed using an amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS). ARMS is typically used to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms or allele types in the same species. However, the application of ARMS for species identification has not been reported. We designed a tetra primer binding the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of 76 samples of Anisakis species and obtained reproducible results. ARMS revealed 380 bp and 130 bp ITS fragments in A. pegreffii, 380 bp and 280 bp fragments in A. simplex, a 130 bp fragments in A. typica and 380 bp, 280 bp and 130 bp fragments in an A. simplex - A. pegreffii hybrid. ARMS using a tetra-primer could be a more rapid, efficient, and reliable tool for monitoring Anisakis species more rapidly than restriction fragment length polymorphism.

AB Background/Aim: Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by an increased volume of adipose/connective tissue. This study aims to explore whether steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) is implicated in development of TAO through the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway.
   Methods: Initially, we extracted orbital preadipocytes from 10 TAO patients for culture and identification. After differentiation, cells were inoculated with plasmids with overexpressed SF1, and plasmids with siRNA against SF1, respectively. Then fat content and PGE(2) secretion were measured by using ELISA. The levels of SF1, Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase3, Pref-1, PPAR gamma, Leptin, Adiponectin, p-AMPK alpha(Thr172), p-mTOR(ser2448), and p-S6K(Thr389) were detected by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured by EdU and flow cytometry.
   Results: TAO patients showed reduced SF1 expression in orbital preadipocytes. Overexpression of SF1 led to inhibited expression of Bcl-2, PPAR gamma, Leptin, Adiponectin and p-AMPK alpha(Thr172), fat content, cell proliferation and differentiation, but increased levels of Bax, Caspase3, Pref-1, p-mTOR(ser2448) and p-S6K(Thr389), PGE(2) secretion and apoptosis rate.
   Conclusion: Our result showed up-regulated SF1 may relieve TAO through suppressing cell proliferation and differentiation, but accelerating cell apoptosis by inhibiting the activation of the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.

AB The nuclear human genome harbors sequences of mitochondrial origin, indicating an ancestral transfer of DNA from the mitogenome. Several Nuclear Mitochondria] Segments (NUMTs) have been detected by alignment-based sequence similarity search, as implemented in the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Identifying NUMTs is important for the comprehensive annotation and understanding of the human genome. Here we explore the possibility of detecting NUMTs in the human genome by alignment-free sequence similarity search, such as k-mers (k-tuples, k-grams, oligos of length k) distributions. We find that when k = 6 or larger, the k-mer approach and BLAST search produce almost identical results, e.g., detect the same set of NUMTs longer than 3 kb. However, when k = 5 or k = 4, certain signals are only detected by the alignment-free approach, and these may indicate yet unrecognized, and potentially more ancestral NUMTs. We introduce a "Manhattan plot" style representation of NUMT predictions across the genome, which are calculated based on the reciprocal of the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the nuclear and mitochondrial k-mer frequencies. The further inspection of the k-mer-based NUMT predictions however shows that most of them contain long-terminal-repeat (LTR) annotations, whereas BLAST-based NUMT predictions do not. Thus, similarity of the mitogenome to LTR sequences is recognized, which we validate by finding the mitochondrial k-mer distribution closer to those for transposable sequences and specifically, close to some types of LTR.

AB Planarians are an important model for stem cell and regeneration biology, because they can regenerate any missing body structure in a short time. As an important component of ribosomes, ribosomal proteins can synthesize proteins and play a central role in cell cycle checkpoint, cell survival/senescence/apoptosis, and organismal growth and development. In this study, we identified and amplified the homologous gene of RPS3 in Dugesia japonica. Double-stranded RNA mediated RNAi revealed that when the Dj-RPS3 function was lost by planarians; they did not form blastemas and died 100%. Further investigation, confirmed that Dj-RPS3 was involved in regulating the proliferative and early differentiation of neoblasts.

AB CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene-editing, using injected Cas9 protein, was achieved in the Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspensa, by initially targeting an exogenous transgene, polyubiquitin-regulated EGFP (PUb-EGFP), for heritable non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) knock-outs using an individual sgRNA. Multiple deletion mutations, ranging from two to five nts proximal to the target site, were identified phenotypically by the loss of green fluorescence in transgenic flies that were also marked with PUb-DsRed. This represented a relatively high efficiency rate of 29% for germ-line mutations. Similar conditions were then used to target an endogenous sex-determination gene, As-transformer-2 (Astra-2), using two sgRNAs that targeted independent exon sequences 671 bp apart. Somatic mutations were identified phenotypically in G(0) adult flies at a frequency of 81% based upon intersexual genital morphology, expected to occur only in XX females since Astra-2 knock-outs by dsRNA do not have a phenotypic effect in XY males. Consistent with this expectation, twelve types of short indels, ranging from -15 nts to +5 nts, were identified proximal to the 5' sgRNA-1 target site in intersexual adults. However, the 3' sgRNA-2 target was only associated with a single 774 bp deletion extending from the sgRNA-1 target site to 100 bp downstream of the sgRNA-2 target. This is encouraging for the eventual use of dual target sites for homology-directed repair (HDR) insertions, but suggests that the sgRNA-2 target site tested may not be optimal for Astra-2 HDR modification.

AB Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common cause of lung cancer-related deaths. Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) play an essential role in cancer development and progression. In this study, we identified PILAR1, a prognostic and overexpressed LncRNA, using multiple independent datasets of LUAD patients. Higher expression of PILAR1 was associated with survival in Dhanasekaran et al. (HR = 2.29, p-value = 0.017), TCGA (HR = 1.51, p-value = 0.017) and KM plotter (HR = 2.67, p-value <= 0.0001) cohorts. Mutational landscape of LUAD showed that KEAP1 mutation was exclusively present in PILAR1 expressing samples. Further, knockdown of PILAR1 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation and migration of A549 cells. Importantly, inhibition of PILAR1 made the A549 cells more sensitive to etoposide. Furthermore, pathway analysis using differentially expressed genes in PILAR1 knockdown cells compared to control cells identified enrichment of DNA repair genes suggesting towards the mechanism of PILAR1 mediated etoposide sensitivity. Taken together, we identified a prognostically robust LncRNA, PILAR1, which also regulates cell growth in lung cancer cells. PILAR1 expression identified a novel subtype of LUAD patients with the exclusive KEAP1 mutation.

AB Lhx9 is a LIM-homeodomain protein related to gonad development and sex reversal. In this study, we cloned and characterized CS-Lhx9 in the gonads of the Chinese tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis). The full-length cDNA of CS-Lhx9 was 3123 bp, including an ORF of 1149 bp encoding 383 amino acids which contains two LIM domains and a homeobox domain. CS-Lhx9 transcripts were primarily observed in the testis of male and neomale at 1 yah, but nearly undetectable in the ovary. During the development of gonad, CS-Lhx9 exhibited an increasing trend and appeared to reach its peak value of expression in testis at 1 yah. In situ hybridization was performed in male and neomale gonads at 210 dah and 1 yah. The results showed strong CS-Lhx9 signals in the spermatids and spermatozoa (germ cells). Methylation level of CS-Lhx9 promoter was higher in female and lower in male and neomale gonads, showing a negative correlation with CS-Lhx9 expression.

AB Background: Minnesota is home to the largest Somali immigrant population in the United States. Despite high rates of cervical cancer in this population, immunization rates for the human papillomavirus (HPV) are among the lowest in the nation. Targeting Somali young adults for catch-up vaccinations may be an important strategy for addressing these low rates. This study sought to understand the views of Somali young adults regarding HPV immunization.
   Methods: Four focus groups (N = 34; 21 women) were conducted at an urban clinic in Minnesota. Two groups were all female, one all male, and one mixed gender. Participants in each group discussed their views on immunization in general, and then their views on HPV immunization.
   Findings: Most participants had prior negative experiences with immunization and were skeptical concerning its value. In general, participants had low knowledge about HPV, though they expressed interest in knowing more. Views about HPV were influenced by culture, with risk perceived as low due to interpretations of religious beliefs and expectations around sexual behavior. Low levels of trust in doctors and other healthcare providers influenced participants' perceptions of the benefits of immunization. Participants also valued autonomy highly and resented having received required vaccinations without much choice, such as through their immigration experience or by school authorities. Participants suggested making more opportunities available for learning about HPV and how to prevent it, including via web-based platforms.
   Conclusion: An important opportunity exists to address low HPV immunization rates in the Somali American population by offering vaccination to young adults, who are interested in learning more about HPV. However, key barriers around HPV needs to be addressed in ways that respect the need for autonomy in this age group and that build trust with providers, which may mean avoiding authoritative approaches.

AB Background: Despite a long-standing vaccination programme, seasonal influenza remains a major public health problem in England, in particular for the elderly where a significant disease burden remains despite vaccine coverage approaching the WHO target of 75%. The recently licensed adjuvanted trivalent vaccines (TIV-ADJ) have been shown to offer greater protection for the elderly compared to the standarddose non-adjuvanted trivalent vaccines (TIV), particularly for those individuals 75 years old and above for whom the TIV has limited effectiveness. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of the TIV-ADJ for use in the elderly.
   Methods: We used a dynamic SEIR-type transmission model coupled with an economic evaluation framework, estimating the reduction in GP consultations, hospitalisations and influenza-attributable mortality. We assessed the optimal use of the TIV-ADJ by estimating the cost-effectiveness of programmes that used this vaccine in the 65+ and 75+ age groups.
   Findings: The use of TIV-ADJ is highly cost-effective for both target age cohorts with incremental costeffectiveness ratios well below the 20,000 pound per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) with over 90% probability that the vaccine is cost-effective at a cost-effectiveness threshold of 30,000 pound per QALY.
   Interpretation: The increased protection provided across all three influenza vaccine sub-types makes TIV-ADJ a more attractive option than TIV from the perspective of the healthcare provider, driven by the increased efficacy against A(H3N2). When deciding on the optimal use of the newly available vaccine it is important to consider the fact that TIV has very limited effectiveness for the 75+ age group, who would therefore get the greatest benefit from a more effective vaccine.

AB Billions of hours of YouTube content are viewed every day. Much of this content is aimed at entertainment, some of it is educational, and a considerable quantity is meant to influence or reinforce public opinion on a variety of matters, including health. Most of the content on YouTube is not created by professionals, public institutions or the traditional media, and instead is authored by private individual content creators. Given the potential impact of this medium for communicating health information, it is important for researchers and public health practitioners to understand the nature of health information as it is shared on YouTube. The primary objective of this research is to describe expressions of vaccine hesitancy content on YouTube, and specifically, compare the expression of pro- and anti immunization sentiments. We do this by not only analyzing a systematic sample of influenza and measles immunization videos in terms of viewer analytics, but also by choice of language. We find that pro- and anti-immunization videos are common, but that videos with anti-immunization sentiment tend to be more 'liked'. We also find that a small number of words can be effectively used to identify anti immunization content, an observation that could be useful for identifying trends in anti-immunization sentiment on social media. Our results suggest that public health experts may need to increase the profile of their content on YouTube, and that there may be some useful strategies for improving the public's disposition towards pro-immunization messaging.

AB Background: Fisherfolks (FF) and female sex workers (FSW) in Uganda could be suitable key populations for HIV vaccine efficacy trials because of the high HIV incidence and good retention in observational cohorts. However, the observed HIV incidence may differ in participants who enroll into a trial. We used simulated vaccine efficacy trials (SiVET) nested within observational cohorts in these populations to evaluate this difference.
   Methods: SiVETs were nested in two observational cohorts (Jul 2012-Apr 2014 in FF and Aug 2014-Apr 2017 in FSW). From Jan 2012 all observational cohort participants (aged 18-49 years) presenting for quarterly visits were screened for enrolment into SiVETs, until 572 were enrolled. Those not enrolled (screened-out or not screened) in SiVET continued participation in the observational cohorts. In addition to procedures in the observational cohorts (HIV testing & risk assessment), SiVET participants were given a licensed Hepatitis B vaccine mimicking a schedule of a possible HIV vaccine, and followed-up for 12 months.
   Findings: In total, 3989 participants were enrolled into observational cohorts (1575 FF prior to Jul 2012 and 2414 FSW prior to Aug 2014). Of these 3622 (90.8%) returned at least once, 672 (44.1%) were screened and 572 enrolled in the SiVETs. HIV incidence pre SIVETs was 4.5/100 person years-at-risk (pyar), 95%CI (3.8-5.5). HIV incidence in SiVET was 3.5/100 pyar, (2.2-5.6) and higher in those not enrolled in the SiVET, 5.9/100 pyar, (4.3-8.1). This difference was greatest among FF. In the 12 months post-SIVET period (FF, May 2014-Apr 2015 and FSW, May 2017-Apr 2018), the HIV incidence was 3.7/100 pyar, (2.5-5.8).
   Interpretation: HIV incidence was lower in SiVET participants compared to non-SiVET. This difference was different for the two populations. Researchers designing HIV efficacy trials using observational cohort data need to consider the potential for lower than expected HIV incidence following screening and enrolment. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB The standard membrane-feeding assay (SMFA) is a functional assay that has been used to inform the development of transmission-blocking vaccines (TBV) against Plasmodium falciparum malaria. For Pfs230, a lead target antigen for TBV development, a few studies have tested either a single anti-Pfs230 poly-clonal or monoclonal antibody (one antibody per study) at serial dilutions and showed a dose-dependent response. Further, there have been reports that the SMFA activity of anti-Pfs230 poly-clonal and monoclonal antibodies were enhanced in the presence of complement. However, no analysis has been performed with multiple samples, and the impact of anti-Pfs230 antibody titers, IgG subclass profile and avidity were evaluated together in relation to transmission-reducing activity (TRA) by SMFA. In this report, a total of 39 unique anti-Pfs230 IgGs from five different mouse immunization studies were assessed for their ELISA units (EU), IgG2/IgG1 ratio and avidity by ELISA, and the functionality (% transmission-reducing activity, %TRA) by SMFA. The mice were immunized with Pfs230 alone, Pfs230 conjugated to CRM197, or a mixture of unconjugated Pfs230 and CRM 197 proteins using Alhydrogel or Montanide ISA720 adjuvants. In all studies, the Pfs230 antigen was from the same source. There was a significant correlation between EU and %TRA (p < 0.0001 by a Spearman rank test) for the anti-Pfs230 lgGs. Notably, multiple linear regression analyses showed that both IgG2/IgG1 ratio and avidity significantly affected %TRA (p = 0.003 to p = 0.014, depending on the models) after adjusting for EU. The results suggest that in addition to antibody titers, IgG2/IgG1 ratio and avidity should each be evaluated to predict the biological activity of anti-Pfs230 antibodies for future vaccine development.

AB To increase vaccination coverage, it is essential to understand the vaccine decision-making process. High population coverage is required to obtain herd immunity and to protect vulnerable groups in terms of age (e.g. the very young) or health (e.g. immunodeficiency). Vaccine confidence and coverage in South Africa are relatively low, opening the window for sustained outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in a country facing one of the most severe HIV epidemics in the world, To capture the vaccine-related decision-making process in South Africa, we performed a discrete choice experiment with 1200 participants in December 2017. We asked for their preferences with respect to (1) vaccine effectiveness, (2) vaccine-preventable burden of disease, (3) accessibility of the vaccine in terms of co-payment and prescription requirements, (4) frequency of mild vaccine-related side-effects, (5) population vaccination coverage and (6) local vaccination coverage. We distinguished between decision-making for vaccines administered to the participant, and for vaccines administered to their youngest child. We analyzed the data for each of these groups using a panel mixed logit model and found similar results for decisions to vaccinate oneself or one's child. Vaccine effectiveness was the most important attribute followed by population coverage and burden of disease. Local coverage and accessibility were also important determinants of vaccination behavior, but to a lesser extent. Regarding population and local coverage, we observed a positive effect on vaccine utility indicating the potential of peer influence. As such, social normative influence could be exploited to increase vaccination confidence and coverage. With respect to vaccine-preventable burden of the disease, the marginal utilities showed disease severity to be more important than frequency of disease. Policymakers and health care workers should stress the effectiveness of vaccines together with the severity of vaccine-preventable diseases. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Compelling evidence has shown that blocking VEGF via monoclonal antibodies may be beneficial in that it not only inhibits tumor angiogenesis but also reduces immune suppression and promotes T cell infiltration into tumors. Herein, we determined whether our recently generated VEGF165b mutant could be used as a co-immunization adjunct to augment the peptide cancer-vaccine-induced immune response in a mouse model of breast cancer. When co-immunized mVEGF165b with the peptide-based cancer vaccine (MUC1, a T-cell epitope dominant peptide vaccine from Mucin1), the VEGF antibody titers increased approximately 600,000-fold in mice. Moreover, the anti-VEGF antibody also reduced the frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in both preventive and therapeutic scenarios. Mechanistically, the decrease of the Tregs population was associated with a remarkably increased MUC-1-specific IFN-gamma-producing CD8(+) T cells and anti-MUC1 humoral response. Finally, this combination co-immunization produced a superior antitumor response and significantly prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, our findings suggest that mVEGF165b may be an ideal immunization adjunct to enhance the immune efficacy of peptide-based tumor vaccines by overcoming immune tolerance.

TI Evaluation of alternative endpoints for ZIKV vaccine efficacy trials

DE Zika virus; Teratogen; Clinical trial; Vaccine efficacy; Simulation
   study
ID VIRUS-INFECTION
AB Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is associated with microcephaly and other birth defects, collectively termed Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS). During the epidemic in 2015-16, ZIKV spread through the Americas and quickly joined the list of other known teratogenic pathogens, TORCH. Multiple ZIKV vaccines have been developed for protection of pregnant women and women of childbearing age. However, ZIKV infection incidence has since waned substantially, and adverse birth outcomes are rare outcomes of infection. Studying a vaccine's protective efficacy against CZS in a large phase III clinical trial may be infeasible in such times of low incidence. Should trials be initiated, researchers may resort to alternative clinical endpoints.
   In this study, we simulate a variety of vaccine clinical trial scenarios to evaluate the feasibility of the CZS endpoint in vaccine studies and compare CZS to other potential outcomes: ZIKV infection detected through weekly, biweekly, or monthly testing and laboratory-confirmed, symptomatic Zika Virus Disease. We compare the sample size required for 80% statistical power to detect vaccine efficacy and trial duration for each scenario. Our results show the feasibility of CZS clinical endpoints depends on the timing of simulated clinical trials in the course of a seasonal epidemic, due to CZS risk varying with trimester of infection. This result highlights additional considerations needed when designing vaccine efficacy trials of protection against teratogenic pathogens. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: Rates of full childhood immunization in Ethiopia are well below the WHO global goal of 90% coverage by 2020. This study explores associations between sociodemographic characteristics and healthcare services utilization with experiences of not receiving a vaccine in Ethiopia.
   Methods: This analysis uses data from Ethiopia's 2012 Expanded Program on Immunization Coverage Survey. The relationships between explanatory variables, including sociodemographic and healthcare utilization factors, and various reasons a child was not vaccinated were assessed with Rao-Scott chi-square tests. Multivariable logistic regression analyses examined significant predictors of these experiences.
   Results: The sample includes the caregivers of 2,722 children. Experiences of not receiving a vaccine were characterized overall and by type of experience: whether a caregiver ever refused vaccination for their child (2.9%), ever decided to not take their child to a health center for vaccination (3.6%), and ever went to a health facility for vaccination but child was not vaccinated (12.0%). Region of residence, possession of a vaccination card, and the setting of the child's last routine vaccination were predictors of not receiving a vaccine. Caregivers reported negative perceptions of vaccines were among their reasons for refusing a vaccine or declining to take their child to a health facility for vaccination.
   Conclusion: Prior experiences with health facilities, such as where a child received their last routine vaccine, play a key role in future vaccination. Vaccine receipt at an outreach event is associated with not bringing a child to a health facility for vaccination, which may indicate an unwillingness to visit or difficulty accessing health centers. Further, negative perceptions of vaccines may result in vaccine refusal or delay. Findings of this study provide public health officials with a better understanding of factors related to vaccination experiences and can inform development of interventions that will improve childhood vaccination rates in Ethiopia.

AB The Zika virus (ZIKV) and poxvirus infection are considered as public health emergencies, necessitating the development of effective vaccines. Here, we report novel recombinant DNA-based and non-replicating vaccinia virus (NTV)-based vaccine candidates that express the precursor membrane-envelope (prME) or envelope (E) glycoproteins of ZIKV. After immunization of BABL/c mice with the vaccines using a homologous protocol (DNA/DNA, NTV/NTV) or heterogeneous (DNAJNTV) protocol, a similar level of anti-E IgG and neutralizing antibodies (microneutralization test) were detected in the mice. However, a significantly higher level of E-specific T cell responses was elicited in mice when a heterogeneous prime-boost protocol was used (DNA/NTV) with either the DNA-based or NTV-based vaccines. Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies and a T cell immune response against the vaccinia virus (W) were detected in mice that were subjected to the prime-boost protocol (DNA/NTV), whereas those subjected to a homologous NTV/NTV protocol had higher levels of anti-VV IgG and neutralizing antibodies. Lastly, a novel H-2d-restricted CD8 T-cell epitope, VRSYCYEASISDMAS, was identified in the ZIKV E protein. These data demonstrate proof of concept of a bivalent vaccine candidate against ZIKV and orthopoxvirus, and support the use of DNA-prME prime and NTV-E boost protocols to protect against ZIKV and orthopoxvirus infections.

AB Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic and lymphotropic alpha herpesvirus that causes varicella and herpes zoster (HZ). At a primary infection, VZV causes varicella in young children. Reactivation of latent VZV in sensory ganglia causes painful HZ in elderly people, occasionally leading to a serious complication, postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). A live attenuated VZV vaccine, the first vaccine licensed for the prevention of HZ and PHN is not very effective, while a recombinant subunit vaccine provides higher and longer protection against HZ. In the present study, we developed a new adjuvant system CIA09A, which is composed of cationic liposomes, the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist de-O-acylated lipooligosaccharide, and Quillaja saponin fraction QS-21. We then determined its adjuvant activity for recombinant VZV glycoprotein E (gE) in mice. Co-lyophilization of the liposomal adjuvant formulation with gE did not abolish the immune-stimulating activity. In fact, the CIA09A-adjuvanted gE vaccine was highly effective in eliciting both humoral and cellular immune responses to the recombinant gE protein and VZV in a VZV-primed mouse model. Furthermore, the frequency of gE-specific polyfunctional CD4(+) T cells expressing interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-2 was significantly increased in mice immunized with the adjuvanted vaccine. These data indicate that co-lyophilization of protein antigens with CIA09A enables development of a liposome-adjuvanted vaccine in a single vial to induce strong cell-mediated immunity required for vaccine efficacy. Thus, the CIA09A-adjuvanted gE vaccine warrants further development as a new prophylactic vaccine against HZ. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Hepatitis B vaccination and central demyelination - History, description
   and observed/expected analyses of 624 cases reported to the French

AB Background: Confidence in vaccines is essential for achieving targeted immunization coverage. The current skepticism about vaccine safety feeds on controversies such as the suspicion about a link between hepatitis B (HB) vaccination and central demyelination (CD) after the massive HB immunization campaign in France in 1994-2000. This study assesses the robustness of this signal by analysing all validated cases reported in 1980-2000 and by conducting observed-to-expected (OE) comparisons.
   Methods: After characterizing case profiles, reporting rates per 1,000,000 vaccine doses sold were computed for the period and per year. OE comparisons were conducted by using individual-based and person-year approaches and were stratified by gender.
   Finding: A total of 624CD cases including 422 incident cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) were reported over 20 years. Women accounted for 73.2% (n = 457). Mean age was 29.8 years (SD = 11.1). Incidence of events peaked in 1995-1996 and 1997, these years accounting for 59.8% (n = 373) of cases. Events were mainly reported after booster doses (46.3%, n = 289). The overall reporting rate was 6.5 per 1,000,000 doses sold. The OE analyses produced inconclusive results, the number of observed cases remaining below the expected number.
   Conclusions: The complete disjunction between target and joint populations in the 1990s French HB immunization campaign created an unpreceded situation with similar to 26 million of adults exposed at the age of MS onset. Two findings are noteworthy: the non-random distribution of reports according to the rank of vaccination or years of survey, and the fact that the number of reports sometimes approached the baseline incidence of MS, irrespective of underreporting. While the nature of the link remains unclear, our results are not consistent with a strong association between HB vaccine and MS. Current recommendations targeting newborns with a possible catch-up of at-risk adults should remain the preferred strategy in low-endemic countries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The efficacy of a novel inactivated Lawsonia intracellularis vaccine, Porcilis (R) Lawsonia, was compared to that of a commercially available live attenuated vaccine in three experimental vaccination-challenge studies in pigs. The efficacy of the new vaccine was further tested under field conditions on a farm with a history of acute ileitis.
   The novel inactivated vaccine consists of a freeze-dried antigen fraction that is dissolved just prior to use in either the adjuvant or in Porcilis (R) PCV M Hyo; an existing combination vaccine against porcine circovirus type 2 and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae.
   The three experimental vaccination-challenge trials had a similar design and for each trial 75 piglets were used, randomly allotted to three groups of 25 piglets. The pigs were vaccinated at 4 or 5 weeks of age with either Porcilis (R) Lawsonia in adjuvant or in associated mixed use with Porcilis (R) PCV M Hyo (group 1), with the live vaccine (group 2), or left as unvaccinated controls (group 3). The pigs were challenged with virulent Lawsonia intracellularis 3, 4 or 17 weeks after vaccination. Post-challenge the pigs were evaluated for clinical signs, average daily weight gain, shedding and macroscopic as well as microscopic immuno-histological ileum lesion scores. In the field study, the mortality and key performance parameters were evaluated over a period of 8 months.
   The results of all three experimental vaccination-challenge trials showed that Porcilis (R) Lawsonia induced statistically significant protection against experimental Lawsonia intracellularis infection. This was demonstrated by lower clinical scores, improved weight gain, reduction of Lawsonia intracellularis shedding and reduction of macroscopic as well as microscopic ileum lesion scores when compared to the controls. The protection induced was superior to that of the commercially available live vaccine. In the field study, Porcilis (R) Lawsonia proved to be highly efficacious; reducing Lawsonia associated mortality to zero and improving key production parameters.

AB In contrast to current ether- or detergent-disrupted "split" vaccines (SVs) for influenza, inactivated whole influenza virus particle vaccines (WPVs) retain the original virus structure and components and as such may confer similar immunity to natural infection. In a collaboration between academia and industry, the potential of WPV as a new seasonal influenza vaccine was investigated. Each of the four seasonal influenza vaccine manufacturers in Japan prepared WPVs and SVs from the same batches of purified influenza virus. Both mice and monkeys vaccinated with the WPVs exhibited superior immune responses to those vaccinated with the corresponding SVs. Vaccination with A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) WPV enabled mice to survive a lethal challenge dose of homologous virus whereas those vaccinated with SV succumbed to infection within 6 days. Furthermore, mice vaccinated with WPV induced substantial numbers of multifunctional CD8(+) T cells, important for control of antigenically drifted influenza virus strains. In addition, cytokines and chemokines were detected at early time points in the sera of mice vaccinated with WPV but not in those animals vaccinated with SV. These results indicate that WPVs induce enhanced innate and adaptive immune responses compared to equivalent doses of SVs. Notably, WPV at one fifth of the dose of SV was able to induce potent immunity with limited production of IL-6, one of the pyrogenic cytokines. We thus propose that WPVs with balanced immunogenicity and safety may set a new global standard for seasonal influenza vaccines. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fluorescent nuclear track detectors (FNTD) based on LiF crystals were used for imaging ionizing particle tracks (including high-energy iron ions), by exploiting photoluminescence of radiation induced F-2 and F-3(+) color centers. The relation between photoluminescence emission spectrum of LiF and quality of FNTD images was investigated. It was found that in the applied experimental conditions, the emission within the green band (530nm, F-3(+)) is very weak compared to the red band (670 nm, F-2). The optimum signal to noise ratio was achieved with setting the measuring window at wavelengths longer than 570 nm. Good quality track images in the green spectral range were obtained only for the highest ionization density: for stopping iron ions.
   Investigations of the bleaching phenomenon revealed a strong decrease of the PL intensity after long excitation times, in the range of several minutes. The amount of this decrease depends on the used excitation power. In the conditions which were typically applied during FNTD measurements the intensity loss was negligible.

AB The effect of the self-trapped excitons interaction under dense laser excitation was studied in ZnMoO4 and CaMoO4. The interaction results in the quenching of exciton's luminescence and in the non-exponential character of decay kinetics. The threshold values of exciton's concentration in the crystals for the quenching effect are determined. The generalized quenching model, which accounts for thermal quenching of excitonic emission and excitons mobility has been developed. The model has been applied for numerical simulation of the experimental data and allowed to obtain the parameters of dynamics (diffusion) and interaction (radius of the dipole-dipole interaction) of self-trapped excitons with account for 3D nonuniform distribution of the initial concentration of excitations.

AB Nominally Nd 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2% doped YAIO(3) (YAP) single crystals were synthesized by the floating zone method to evaluate their optical and scintillation properties. In photoluminescence (PL), all the samples showed sharp emission lines in the UV-VIS region, and the PL quantum yield in this spectral range was 5-15%. The PL decay time of the F-4(7/2) -> I-4(9/2) transition was evaluated to be around 150 ms. In scintillation emission spectrum under X-ray irradiation, several emission lines due to the 4f-4f transitions of Nd3+ were observed in the UV-VIS range. These emissions was found to consist of two decay constants of a few as and 100-150 ms. When irradiated with 662 keV gamma-rays from Cs-137, the Nd 0.1% doped sample exhibited the highest scintillation light yield of 12500 ph/MeV determined by pulse height analysis.

Some slower component can be found, which can be related to the local inhomogeneities of ceramic sample and self-absorption of Ce3+. Meanwhile, the Ce:GYGAG ceramics perform excellent on scintillation efficiency which is evaluated by the XEL steady-state luminescence and its fast part characterized by light yield (LY). The LY value reaches similar to 45000 ph/MeV with an energy resolution of 8.67% under the gamma-ray excitation. The LY0.5 mu s/LY6 mu s value of Ce:GYGAG is calculated to be 87.5% which is much superior than 42.5% in compared Ce:LuAG ceramics. In the scintillation decays, a lower content of slow components are detected in Ce:GYGAG ceramic sample comparing to the Ce:LuAG ceramics.

AB Terbium gallium garnet (TGG) ceramics were fabricated by air sintering and successive HIP post-treating from the TGG nanoparticles synthesized via the co-precipitation technique. The influences of the calcination temperature on the phase and morphology evolution of the nano-powders, as well as the optical transparency and microstructure of the obtained TGG ceramics were investigated in detail. The powders calcined at 1100-1250 degrees C retained the TGG phase purity and displayed significantly less agglomeration. Using the above powders as raw materials, the TGG ceramics pre-sintered at 1500 degrees C for 3 h in air and then HIP post-treated at 1550 degrees C for 3 h under 150 MPa argon gas showed the similar optical qualities and the in-line transmittances were about 70% at 1064 nm. The Verdet constants of all the ceramics were calculated to be about 137 rad T-1 m(-1) at room temperature, which were nearly independent of the optical quality of the ceramics.

AB A series of novel Y2GeO5: Bi3+, Tm3+ Tb3+, Eu3+ (YGO: Bi3+, Tm3+, Tb3+, Eu3+) phosphors were synthesized via high-temperature solid-state reaction. The structural, luminescent properties, as well as energy transfer mechanisms, in the phosphors were investigated in detail. The results indicate that all Bi3+, Tm3+, Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions substitute for Y3+ ions in host lattice of YGO without changing its crystal structure. Excitation and emission spectra were evaluated for the compounds. Energy transfer from Bi3+ to Tm3+, Tb3+/Eu3+ and Tb3+ to Eu3+ exist in phosphors YGO: Bi3+, Tm3+, Tb3+, Eu3+. Under the 308 nm excitation, the phosphor YGO: Bi3+, Tm3+, Tb3+ shows the characteristic transitions of Bi3+ (372 nm, (3)P1,0 -> S-1(0), Tm3+ (455 nm, D-1(2) -> F-3(4)), Tb3+ (544 nm, D-5(4) -> F-7(5)). However, Eu3+ is absent in the composition. Tunable colors from blue to green to red and white are achieved by varying excitation wavelength. The energy transfer from Bi3+ to Tm3+ is proved to be an electric dipole-dipole interaction. A white-light emission with the color coordinate (0.3146, 0.3541), correlated color temperature (CCT) of 6234 K, luminous efficacy of the radiation (LER) of 180 lm/W and 0.2345-0.2424 eV of activation energy for thermal quenching are obtained in the optimum phosphor YGO: 0.005Bi(3+), 0.04 Tm3+, 0.07 Tb3+, 0.05Eu(3+). The obtained results indicate that the YGO: Bi3+, Tm3+, Tb3+, Eu3+ phosphors can serve as potential color-tunable and single-phase white emission phosphors with impressive color stability as well as good thermal stability for n-UV excited white LEDs.

AB Yb3+/Er3+/Tm3+ tri-doped CaF2 single crystals have been successfully synthesized via Temperature Gradient Technique (TGT) method, and represented by X-ray diffraction (XRD) examination, absorption and fluorescence spectrum, pump power dependence and lifetime analysis in details. Under the excitation of 980 nm laser diode (LD), the upconversion luminescence (UCL) spectra of Yb3+ /Er3+/Tm3+ /CaE2 as a function of Tm3+ concentration are made up of intense blue (Tm-3+:(1)G(4) -> H-3(6)), green (Er3+: S-4(3/2), H-2(11/2) -> I-4(15/2)), and red (Er3+:F-4(9/2) -> I-4(15/2)) emissions, which are located at 478, 523, 539 and 656 nm, respectively. With increasing concentration of Tm, the color can be tunable from orange-yellow, white to blue light. And the optimal Yb3+/Er3+/Tm3+ doping concentrations for white light are determined to be 10%Yb, 0.1%Er and 0.05%Tm. The research indicates that the as-prepared materials may have potential applications in the fields of three dimensional displays, back lighting, white light sources, and so on.

ID GRAPHENE
AB Optical contrast imaging technique has been widely practiced for fast and easy thickness determination of 2D layered materials. CCDs used for such optical imaging, inherently doesn't provide any spectral information, however, by introducing RGB filters, a very narrow bandwidth spectral information of the reflected light can be recorded. Such limited database of spectral line of the reflected light fails to provide optimized contrast of the 2D flakes with the variation of flake thickness (layer number). In this report, instead of using conventional RGB filter-based CCDs, we have presented a comprehensive spectroscopic mapping of white light reflection from 2D MoS2 flake of different thickness, which provides information about spectral dependency of the optical contrast in the full visible range. It exactly defines the spectral range of filters to be selected for optimized contrast imaging. The reported spectroscopic mapping data provides a calibrated method for accurate measurement of MoS2 flake thickness. The contrast spectra has also been calculated theoretically by Fresnel's theory, which agrees well with our experimental values. The accuracy and consistency of this approach have been verified by conducting AFM measurements.

AB Ordered defective structures in lithium niobate crystals have been established. The phenomenon is a result of non-equilibrium processes of a different nature: photo-induced light scattering, laser ablation, and creation of cracks during relieving mechanical stresses. The shape of such structures depends on the nature and energy that affect a crystal. A number of concentric areas with a different density of laser-induced defects with a changed refractive index appear during photoinduced light scattering. Concentric clusters of microdomains appear in a macrodomain of another sign at laser ablation as a result of local switching under impulse laser radiation. A number of microcracks with a fractal structure appear near main macro-crack during cracking under mechanical stress. Thus, appearance of ordered defective structure occurs not only in the local spot of direct exposure to laser radiation, mechanical stress, etc., but also in some volume of a crystal around it.

AB Most commercially available fluorescent dyes used for cellular images are toxic and their luminescence is often outshined by the intrinsic autofluorescence of the biological medium, the use of long emission lifetime inherent of the lanthanide compounds is a viable alternative. This paper reports the development of a luminescent hybrid based on silica nanoparticles decorated with Tb3+ complexes suitable for use in exploratory tests as biomarkers in the visualization of CHO-k1 cells by microscopy techniques. To achieve this aim, spherical/spheroidal (similar to 125 nm) functionalized silica particles were prepared by the sol-gel method and had their surface functionalized covalently with Schiff base ligands. Tb3+ Complexes were bonded onto the particles surface by a step-bystep methodology approach. By zeta potential, it was possible to investigate the particles surface charge after each synthesis step, reaching a negative value for the final hybrid, which showed intense luminescence in the green region, where the Tb3+ D-5(4) -> F-7(J) transitions were observed in the emission spectrum. After the benzoic acid ligand (BzAc) addition, there was an intensification of Tb3+ emission, as well as an increase in the emission lifetime. Concerning the biological application of the material, the CHO-k1 cell viability was evaluated by the MTT method in the presence of the SiO2-[Tb(SB)(BzAc)(y)] hybrid, and high biocompatibility was observed. The absorption process of particles by the cells was investigated by TEM, suggesting an endocytosis mechanism as a probable uptake process. The confocal images indicated a green emission of the biomarker due to the Tb3+ distributed through the cytoplasm, mainly closely to the cell nuclei. Therefore, the silica particles decorated with Tb3+ complexes proved to be suitable to act as biomarkers in biological assays and cellular imaging.

AB In this study, we have synthesized xCeF(3)-(30-x)BaF2-20Al(2)O(3)-50B(2)O(3) (x = 0, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0 and 10.0 mol%) glasses by the conventional melt-quenching method and then investigated the optical properties (transmittance spectra, photoluminescence (PL) spectra and PL decay times), scintillation properties under X-rays irradiation (scintillation spectra and scintillation decay times) and thermally-stimulated luminescence (TSL) properties (glow curves and dose response functions). The PL spectra of the Ce-doped samples consist of an intense emission band due to the 5d-4f transitions of Ce3+ ion peaking at 350-400 nm, and PL quantum yield value was 70.1%. The decay time of the latter emission slightly varied in a range of 32-36 ns depending on the Ce concentration. The Ce-doped samples have also shown strong scintillation under X-ray irradiation having a spectrum of an intense emission band. The peak position around 300-400 nm with the Ce3+ concentration, and the decay time ranged 19-44 ns. The scintillation light yield of 5.0% Ce-doped sample was the highest among the present samples, and the measured value was 1,800 ph/MeV under Cs-137 gamma-ray exposure.

AB The work is dedicated to the investigation of Eu3+ multicenter formation and luminescent properties of Ca3Sc2Si3O12:Eu (CSSG:Eu) and Ca2YScMgSiO12:Eu (CYMSSG:Eu) single crystalline film (SCF) phosphors, grown by liquid phase epitaxy method onto Gd3Ga2.5Al2.5O12 (GAGG) and Y3Al5O12 (YAG) substrates, respectively. We have found notable differences in the luminescent properties of CSSG:Eu and CYMSSG:Eu SCFs caused by the Eu3+ multicenter formation in both garnets due to the different local surrounding of Eu3+ ions in the dodecahedral positions by the non-isovalent Sc3+/Mg2+ and Si4+ cations in the octahedral and tetrahedral positions of garnet hosts, respectively. A feature of the Eu3+ center creation in CYMSSG:Eu garnet in comparison with CSSG:Eu counterpart is the possibility of localization of Eu3+ ions in dodecahedral sites of both Ca2+ and Y3+ cations. However, based on the obtained results, we have presupposed preferable localization of the Eu3+ ions mainly in the Y3+ positions of this garnet.

AB The atomic and electronic structure of CeO2 doped with Tb has been calculated from first principles with inclusion of strong correlation effects on the basis of Hubbard model (OFT + U). The two values of Hubbard U parameter were applied separately on Ce and Tb ions, in order to treat correctly two oxidation states of Tb (3 + and 4 +). Crystal structure distortion is also discussed for Tb3+ ions in ceria without oxygen vacancies. The corresponding total energy difference between the 3 + and 4 + states is very small and, thus, these states can co-exist without oxygen vacancy formation (unlike Gd doping). Multiple configurations have been obtained with localization of electrons on different number of cations, if the Tb ion has an oxygen vacancy nearby. A site symmetry approach has been successfully applied to identify the ground state configuration. Gibbs formation energy of oxygen vacancy due to Tb doping is reduced by almost a factor of four, in comparison with the pure CeO2. The dependence of Gibbs formation energy on the temperature and oxygen partial pressure is discussed. It has been also shown that the lowest formation energy for the small polaron occurs when the Ce3+ and Tb3+ ions are located as nearest neighbors to oxygen vacancy. The results obtained are compared with the existing literature data from the electrical conductivity and optical measurements.

AB Preparation technology, the structure determination, multiband luminescence and nonlinear optical properties (NLO) of the chalcogenide glasses are subject of present work. The Ag0.05Ga0.05Ge0.95S2-Er2S3 glass samples with two different 0.12 and 0.27 at.% Er content were prepared by classical two-stage melt-quenching method. Glass state and morphology were confirmed by X-ray and EDS techniques. Influence of the Erbium doping on the luminescence and NLO properties was investigated. Based on the diagram of energy levels for the Era ions, we proposed a model that explains photoluminescence (PL) emission mechanism. It should be emphasized that investigated glasses (in comparison with other materials) are exceptional in that all bands of PL are intense due to small energy losses at excitation and emission of ions Er3+. The photoinduced second and third harmonic generations have been measured in the reflected geometry and compared with reference - BiB3O6 (BBO): 10%Nd crystal.

AB In this work, a novel Mn4+ doped BaTiOF4 oxyfluoride red-emitting phosphor was fabricated through a two-step wet chemical synthesis on a large scale at an ambient temperature. The crystal structure, morphology, and elemental composition were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer respectively. The luminescence properties were investigated from emission, excitation and ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance (DRS). The as-prepared BaTiOF4:Mn4+ product is well crystallized into single orthorhombic phase with particulate morphology and presents sharp red emission lines locating around 631 nm under illumination at 470 nm blue light. The single red LED, based on the novel BaTiOF4:Mn4+ phosphor exhibits bright red color with CIE chromaticity coordinate values of x = 0.692 and y = 0.308, revealing it may find application in LED backlighting.

Structural parameters of these systems reflect ionic radii of components A, B' and B ''. Regarding band structures, two groups of systems may be specified, because the band gaps of double perovskite oxides are tuned by the Mo-O and W-O sublattices. Direct (E-g(X)) and indirect (E-g(F-X)) band gaps in the range from 3.4 to 4.4 eV are predicted for materials studied. The results of hybrid DFT calculations for band gaps are strongly overestimated with respect to available experimental data. The findings presented here suggest that the reported in literature character of some indirect gaps of A(2)B'B '' O-6 compounds may be questionable.

AB The TeO2-WO3-GeO2-NdF3 (TWGNd) glasses containing various amounts of NdF3 were synthesized through melt-quenching method and analyzed for 1.06 mu m fiber lasers. The index of refraction increases with the addition of NdF3 content at 5893 angstrom wavelength. Different spectroscopic and radiative parameters were determined applying the standard Judd-Ofelt theory. The TWGNd glasses exhibit three emission transitions peaked at similar to 0.90, similar to 1.06 and similar to 1.33 mu m corresponding to F-4(3/2) -> I-4(9/2), I-4(11/2), I-4(13/2) transitions, respectively at 808 and 514.5 nm laser excitations. A quenching in luminescence was noticed beyond 1.0 mol% of NdF3 content. The saturation intensities that were used to know the threshold power of input source for laser operation were determined. The observed results show that the TWGNd10 glass has the best choice to develop 1.06 mu m fiber lasers.

AB A new 30 GeO2-30 TeO2-15 ZnO-10 Na2CO3-10 CaF2-3 La2O3-2 YbF3 glass composition was synthesized and submitted to several heat treatments to provoke nanocrystallization in its bulk. The formation of nanocrystallites was evidenced by high resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, and their nature and size was characterized. The spectroscopic and magnetic properties of the Yb3+ ions dissolved in the glass and, presumably, in the nanocrystallites, were investigated by absorption and emission spectroscopies (including anti-Stokes emissions from Tm3+ and Er3+ impurities), fluorescence transients and magnetic susceptibility measurements. It was found that the Yb3+ ions experimental lifetime and average effective magnetic moment, as well as Tm3+ and Er3+ ions anti-Stokes emission intensities, increase with increasing crystallization state of the initial glass.

AB Electron spin resonance (ESR) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of anion-deficient alumina single crystals were measured. High-dose irradiation by a pulsed electron beam (130 keV) causes an absorption line with g(perpendicular to) = 2.008 +/- 0.002 in the ESR spectrum. In contrast to the irradiation by the beta-source, there is no overlapping of this line with another one in the obtained ESR spectrum, which allowed to investigate the thermal stability of this line more in details and to prove that it consists of several elementary components. A drop in PL intensity of F+-centers (3.8 eV) and F-centers (3.0 eV) is observed with increasing of ESR absorption line with g(perpendicular to) = 2.008 +/- 0.002. Parallel studies of ESR and PL spectra under stepped annealing in the temperature range of 523-973 K showed that the radiation-induced paramagnetic center was stable up to 873-973 K. A possible association of the disappearance of the ESR absorption line with the destruction of F-type aggregate defect and with changing charge state of the paramagnetic center caused by emptying of deep electron and hole traps at T = 773-973 K is discussed in the paper.

AB Write Once Read Many (WORM) Memory, as one of the most important nonvolatile memory type, has widespread used in a variety of permanent storage applications in the Big Data age. As an excellent material, CsPbBr3 quantum dots have widely used in a lot of photoelectric devices, but CsPbBr3 quantum dots based memory device remain to be studied. In this work a WORM memory device based on CsPbBr3 quantum dots is demonstrated. The CsPbBr3 QDs based WORM shows great reproducibility, good data retention ability, irreversible electrical transition from the high resistance state (HRS) or OFF state to the low resistance state (LRS) or ON state and the resistance ratio (ON/OFF) can reach almost 10(4). Additionally, the device exhibits high performances under low power consumption low reading voltage (-0.5V) and writing voltage (-1.1V). To study the CsPbBr3 QDs based WORM provides an opportunity to develop the next generation high-performance and stable WORM devices.

AB New red emitting Eu3+ doped and substituted BaLaAlO4 phosphor powders were synthesized by simple modified solid state reaction method. BaLaAlO4 crystal phase formation studied through powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Fourier Transform - Infra Red (FT-IR) analysis was performed to study the formation of the host with respect to temperature increment and metal-oxygen bond vibrations of BaLaAlO4 host lattice. Morphology of the phosphor was appeared as irregular in shapes with agglomeration. Photoluminescence (PL) analysis was performed to study the PL excitation and emission characteristics of the phosphor. It dictates that synthesized phosphors exhibited a strong red emission at 626 nm. Substitution effect of Eu3+ in BaLaAlO4 with various compositions such as Ba(1-x)LaAlO4: Eu-x(3+), BaLa(1-y)AlO4: Eu-z(3+) and BaLaAl(1-x)O4: Eu-z(3+) were studied for PL enhancement. Luminescence decay time of the phosphors was also determined. PL thermal quenching and Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity analysis were carried out to find thermal stability and colour purity of the phosphor sample respectively. The Judd- Ofelt parameters (Omega(2) & Omega(4)) obtained from the emission spectra of Eu3+ ions in BaLaAlO4 host lattice were evaluated and discussed.

AB Herein, we report photoluminescence properties by embedding a purely organic fluorophore into a polymer matrix. Biopolymer-polylactic acid [PLA] doped with bischalcone, [1, 3-bis (4-bromobenzylidene) cyclohexan-2-one] is found to show exciting properties for applications in optoelectronics. This paper focuses on the preparation thin films with different dopant concentrations 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% (w/v) dispersed in PLA by solvent casting method. They are characterized by IR, SEM, TGA, DSC and Powder XRD; evidenced the formation matrix-dopant composite films. The UV absorbance of the pristine PLA film is observed at lambda(max) 300 nm and for the doped films at lambda(max) 330 nm. It is observed that as the dopant concentration increased, the intensity of absorbance also increased indicating the UV blocking property of the films with doped bischalcone. The prominent photoluminescence (PL) emission peak at 440 nm is obtained for doped PLA with dopant dependent increase in absolute quantum yield of 41-62%. Thus, the composite material obtained by doping the bischalcone into the polymer matrix is found to block UV radiations and emit light in the visible region, which could make these films versatile materials for optical applications.

AB In this work, we report on a structurally-colored composite colloidal crystal able to change its color in presence of different polar solvents such as butanol and to distinguish its isomers. Herein, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) infiltrated polystyrene opals are fabricated by means of a two steps approach and their final structure exhibits a green opalescence, the diffraction peak wavelength position changes as a function of the analytes spotted on the surface. In fact, the realized composites present a colorimetric variation in their response, since a remarkable red-shift of the diffraction peak is observed. An analytical model has been proposed and validated in order to assess the optical chromatic response, according to which the changing of the filling factor is the main element that produces the variation in the optical response. The selectivity, sensitivity and the reusability of the sensor have been investigated by monitoring the static reflectance spectra considering a mixture of 2-Methylpropan-2-ol (TerB) and water.
   Dynamic reflection spectra have been employed as an appropriate technique for the recognition of butanol isomers such as TerB, Butan-1-ol (NB) and Butan-2-ol (2B). The results demonstrate that the prepared photonic crystal sensing material and the interrogation approach used are a suitable tool for the development of low cost, portable sensors for homologues and isomers.

AB In the present work, luminescent Sr2CeO4:Eu3+ (5 mol %), Zn2+ (0.25-3 mol %) nanophosphors were fabricated by the ultrasound irradiated sonochemical method. The samples prepared with 3 h ultrasound treatment exhibit well crystalline and single phase Sr2CeO4. The dumbbell shaped morphology of the prepared samples was elucidated from both SEM and TEM results. The energy band gap of the prepared samples was estimated and found to be in the range similar to 3.18-3.63 eV. The incorporation of Zn2+ greatly influences the defect and emission intensities, as revealed from photoluminescence and positron lifetime spectroscopy measurements. The enhancement in the photoluminescence emission intensity after Zn2+ incorporation was observed, which may be due to the creation of defects and efficient energy transfer between Zn2+ and Eu3+ or defects that can act as emission centers. The positron lifetime spectroscopy qualitatively explains the concentration of defects (vacancy and voids) which are induced by Zn2+ co-doping. The encryption strategies are provided using the photo luminescent chalk for high level information protection. We believe that the versatile, convenient and user-friendly strategy demonstrated herein will open a new insight for on-site information protection.

AB Antireflection (AR) coatings are deposited on UV grade fused silica substrates, which are cleaned in the dual ion beam sputtering device. Compared to ultrasonic and acid etching cleaning progress, ion beam etching improves the laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) of substrates and AR coatings significantly at 355 nm. Ion beam etching declines the low LIDT defects drastically and removes lots of the impurity elements (Ce, Fe, K, and Na). Roughness test shows that the AR coatings and substrates with ion beam etching are very flat and of low roughness. Ion beam etching reduces the density of deep defect from substrates greatly. Damage morphologies show double layers delamination, which is explained via calculation of layer stress. This study will be helpful for preparation of high LIDT optical coatings.

AB In this study, light scattering properties of Mg-doped ZnO Nanorods were easily adjusted by hydrothermal process through Non-stoichiometric ratio (Zn(1)MgxO(1), x = 0.2-1). X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-Vis spectrophotometry and photoluminescence revealed that Mg ions substituted the Zn sites without changing the hexagonal wurtzite structure. This was accompanied by gradually decrease in tensile stress due to increased Zn/Mg ratio from 1:0.2 to 1:0.8. The average diameter of NRs rose from similar to 75 to 90 nm and turned into a plane with water ripple as Zn/Mg ratio enhanced to 1:1. The light scattering ability and optical constants of MgZnO NRs exhibited significant wavelength dependency, which exponentially declined as wavelength increased. The higher relative intensities of the visible peak recorded for MgZnO NRs testified of the elevated oxygen vacancies density when Zn/Mg ratio enhanced from 1:0.6 to 1:1. Overall, the proposed method looked promising as facile and novel way for adjusting light-trapping abilities of MgZnO NRs thin films suitable for polymer solar cells and other ZnO-based optoelectronic and photonic devices.

AB We successfully synthesized Eu-doped SiO2 glasses by the spark plasma sintering method, and the prepared glasses doped with various concentrations of Eu (0, 0.002, 0.020 and 0.200%) were studied for optical, dosimeter and scintillation characteristics. The undoped sample showed the luminescence possibly due to the oxygen vacancy in photoluminescence (PL) and scintillation. The Eu-doped samples indicated PL due to the 5d-4f transitions of Eu2+ characterized as a broad emission peaking at approximately 450 nm. In the scintillation, we observed the emission of Eu2+ and Eu3+. The PL and scintillation decay time constants ascribed to the emission from Eu2+ were 1.96-1.99 mu s and 1.63-1.70 mu s, respectively. In the synthesized samples, the 0.002% Eu-doped sample indicated the highest PL quantum yield of 68.6%. Moreover, the highest light yields among the present samples were 407 photons/MeV under Am-241 alpha-ray exposure. The prepared samples showed relatively low afterglow level. The materials also exhibit thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) properties with a major glow peak around 200 degrees C, and when the TSL spectra were observed after the irradiation of X-rays (10 Gy), we confirmed that the luminescence was ascribed to the transitions of Eu3+ in addition to Eu2+. Overall, the samples showed a high sensitive response of TSL which showed a linearity from 0.01 mGy to 100 mGy.

AB In this work the centimeter level silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)/copper nanowires (CuNWs) composites were prepared by the solid-state ionics method and vacuum thermal evaporation method using fast ionic conductor Rb4Cu16Cl13I7 films under 15 mu A direct current electric field (DCEF). The surface morphology and chemical composition of the AgNPs/CuNWs composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), respectively. The fractal dimension of the AgNPs/CuNWs composites was calculated by fractal theory and the surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) performance was detected by Rhodamine 6G (R6G) aqueous solutions as probe molecules. The results indicate that the macroscopic dendritic AgNPs/CuNWs composites arranged neatly near cathode with the longest length of 7 cm were prepared by the solid-state ionics method and vacuum thermal evaporation method. The diameters of CuNWs ranged from 20 to 80 nm and many regularly arranged AgNPs with the diameter from 5 to 15 nm lie in the prepared nano composites, which lead to the AgNPs/CuNWs composites have high surface roughness. The fractal dimension of AgNPs/CuNWs composites was 1.178 and the limiting concentrations of R6G for the prepared high surface roughness AgNPs/CuNWs SEAS substrates is 10(-13) mol/L.

AB The contactless real-time temperature sensing technique with high temporal and spatial resolution is in high demand for the countless applications. Here, the Yb3+/Er3+- codoped GeO2-PbO-PbF2 glass ceramics synthesized via the melt-quenching technique has been presented as an optical thermometer. The thermal sensing was designed based on the temperature dependent fluorescence intensity ratios of thermally (H-2(11/2) and S-4(3/2)) and non-thermally (H-2(11/2) and F-4(9/2)) coupled Er3+ levels. The ratiometric techniques provide the thermal sensing within the temperature range of 300-466 K. The absolute and relative thermal sensitivities as well as the temperature resolution were calculated and compared with other Yb3+/Er3+-doped materials. The temperature of the microelectronic component on the printed circuit board was defined using the optical thermometry as a proof of concept revealing Yb3+/Er3+- codoped GeO2-PbO-PbF2 phosphor to be a promising candidate for precise non-contact thermal sensor.

AB Conductive polymers are high-tech materials with high energy efficiency, bright colors, compatible with ambient conditions and superior optical properties. The properties of the polymer vary depending on the properties of the monomer used in polymer synthesis. For this reason, the use of multifunctional new monomers with high pi-electron density and branching, containing different functional groups, is important in the formation of different types of conductive polymers. In this study, a new monomer suitable for double-sided polymerization on the thiophene groups in the center with the naphthalene molecule has been synthesized (DPN) and polymer P(DPN) has been obtained via this new monomer. P(DPN) is very stable and has the best optical properties. Also it is a special material with the potential to be used for sensor studies with amide groups and active amine protons that can be derivated.

AB This work investigates the energy-transfer processes from Cr3+ to Nd3+ in yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) ceramics by comparing the fluorescence decay of Cr3+ for Nd/Cr:YAG with that of Cr:YAG from 293 to 473 K. The experimentally determined fluorescence decay of Nd3+ excited through Cr3+ is consistent with the theoretical predictions when energy-transfer processes are taken into account by including in the rate equations the dipole-dipole interaction and energy transfer via excitation-energy migration. Furthermore, the results presented herein clarify that the efficiency of energy transfer from Cr3+ to Nd3+ increases slightly with increasing temperature.

AB In this work, luminescent silicon quantum dots (Si-QDs) in flexible and semitransparent porous silicon-polymer hybrid materials exhibiting intense visible luminescence, observed with the naked eye, are reported. Si-QDs within free-standing porous silicon membranes (PSiM) were obtained and transferred to polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates and covered with polymetilacrylate (PMMA), all at room temperature. The effect of the thickness (2.46-13.36 mu m) and porosity (79-85%) of the PSiM on their photoluminescence (PL) properties are analyzed. PSiM of 2.46 mu m thickness shows the most intense PL emission, observed with the naked eye under UV excitation. The transmittance between 450 and 900 nm reduces only-4.9% from that one of the PET substrate when the porosity is about 85%. The size of the Si-QDs, analyzed by Raman spectroscopy, reduces from 4.58 to 3.10 nm when the porosity is increased from 79 to 85%, and as a consequence a PL blue-shift is observed. The PL property of the flexible PMMA/PSiM/PET structures remains stable and breaking strength after several cycles of bending at different angles. Therefore, this work provides an adequate method for the development of hybrid luminescent, flexible and stable PSiM structures for its application as a photon-down converting material.

AB Undoped, Zr-doped and Ti-doped La2Hf2O7 single crystals were grown by the optical floating zone technique to evaluate the scintillation properties. The synthesized single crystals show scintillation signals with a broad peak around 450 nm. The scintillation decay curves indicate the decay time constants are in nanoseconds order. Suggested from the pulse height spectra under Am-241 alpha-ray irradiation, the scintillation light yields of the undoped, Zr-doped and Ti-doped crystal samples are 270, 180 and 390 photons/MeV. From these results, Ti doping seems to enhance the scintillation properties of a La2Hf2O7 crystal.

AB In this study, for the first time, the influences of a monochromatic linearly polarized laser field on the total refractive index changes (TRICs) and the total absorption coefficients (TACs) of quantum well (QW) with the Rosen-Morse potential confinement by constituting GaAs/GaAlAs heterostructure are considered. Time-dependent in the Schrodinger equation is modified through the Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation and the dipole approximation, and then the laser-dressed counterpart of well potential is generated by using the Ehlotzky approximation. The bound state energy values and the wave functions of the Rosen-Morse quantum well (RMQW) under the influence of the intense laser field (ILF) are obtained by using the diagonalization method in the framework of the effective mass approach and the parabolic band approximation. The effects of structure parameters on TRICs and TACs of RMQW are also explained in detail, as well as the ILF's ones. In addition to these, the alternativeness to each other of the structure parameters and the ILF on the optical specifications is also discussed. The results of the present work are necessary and crucial in optimization of the optical specifications of RMQW to be fabricated for devices applications.

AB Photoluminescence (PL), thermoluminescence (TL) emission spectra and TL glow curves of barium yttrium fluoride (BaY2F8-BaYF), undoped and doped with erbium (Er3+) or praseodymium (Pr3+) were measured to investigate the fundamental absorption (band gap E-g), the nature of the trapping centers, as well as the electronic transitions of Ln(3+) in BaYF host. The band gap energy E-g of BaY2F8 was determined by vacuum ultraviolet (VIJV) excitation measurements to be around 11.2 eV. Additionally, the electronic transition from excited states of Ln(3+) ions and the exciton state were also identified. TL emission spectra showed that the TL emission of doped samples is related to the Ln(3+) ion, indicating that the related host trapping centers are not affected by the new trapping centers originated due the dopant ions. Trap depths were calculated by fitting the glow curves using a first order kinetics model. Host-related trapping centers were attributed to intrinsic defects such as V-k and F centers and the new TL peaks observed for Er- and Pr-doped samples was associated to the electrons trapping centers. These results lead us to propose a simple model to explain the origin of the TL emission in BaYF.

AB This paper proposes, for the first time, a quantitative description of the cross section of energy transfer between Nd3+ ions and quantum dots through rate equations model Nd3+ ions were embedded in a SNAB glass system with CdS quantum dots. This occurred because the Nd3+ ions absorbed photons emitted by CdS quantum dots with 457 nm excitation. Band overlap of the quantum dots luminescence band with the ion optical absorption bands caused photon absorption and produced valleys in the quantum dots luminescence spectrum. The energy transfer occurred via photon. The cross section of energy transfer was higher than that found in other semiconductor systems with rare earth.

AB Two new pH fluorescent probes 2,8-bis((E)-2-(1,1-dimethyl-1H-benzo[e]indol-2-yl)vinyl)-6H,12H-5,11-methanodibenzo[b,f] [1,5]diazocine (1) and 2,8-bis((E)-2-(3,3-dimethyl-3H-indol-2-yl)vinyl)-6H,12H-5,11-methanodibenzo[b,f] [1,5]diazocine (2) were designed and synthesized via ethylene bridging of the Troger's Base (TB) framework and indole derivatives. As the protonation of nitrogen atoms of indole derivatives, both probes displayed the significant pH-dependent spectral properties. The probing behavior toward pH variations indicated that probes exhibited excellent pH dependent behavior in the pH ranges of 2.07-7.01 (1) and 1.96-7.01 (2), especially possessing good linear response in the pH ranges of 2.50-4.00. The emissions of 1 can be reversibly switched between brilliant yellow and dark states by protonation and deprotonation. Also, the yellow-green fluorescence emission of 2 could be quenched upon protonation. Such behaviors enable them to work as turn-off fluorescent pH sensors in the solution state. Furthermore, protonation and deprotonation on indole moiety nitrogen of the probe 1 and 2 provided a sensing mechanism for pH changes. In addition, both probes performed good photostability, high selectivity and excellent reversibility.

AB This paper presents the influence of coating thickness on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 coatings. Methylene blue decomposition under UV light was tested. Transparent anatase TiO2 thin films were prepared by the sol-gel method using alcoholic solutions. Thin films were deposited on a borosilicate glass substrate by the multiple dip coating technique across a much wider range than is typically described in literature, specifically, from 1 to 12 dip-coating cycles. The degradation of MB dissolvent in water was measured by UV-Vis spectroscopy. The structure, morphology and optical properties of thin film coatings were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). The crystalline structure of TiO2 films was identified as the anatase phase, consisting of uniform spherical particles from 25 to 32 nm depending on the number of dip-coatings cycles. Decreasing roughness and optical band gaps were also observed in the produced oxide films with increasing numbers of dip-coating cycles. The reaction rate of discoloration of the dye solution by photocatalytic degradation is strongly related to the thickness of the layer, the number of layers and its morphology. The thicker the oxide layer, the faster the reaction; however, this relationship is not linear. In addition, in this article, a methylene blue discoloration reaction model was proposed which takes into account stoichiometry, reagent electric charge balance and the REDOX type of reaction.

AB Natural dye extracted from Cassia fistula (C. fistula) flower is used as photosensitizer to fabricate titanium dioxide (TiO2) based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). Ethanol was used as the extracting solvent. Kaempferol, Leucopelarrgonidin and Rhein are the major pigments present in C. fistula. The optimized molecular structure for these constituents were obtained using density functional theory (DFT) at 6-31G(d,p) level. The HOMO-LUMO analysis was performed to study the energy-gap using optimized structure. All the calculations were performed in the gas phase and taking ethanol as solvent. The electron transfer characteristics between the dyes lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the conduction band of TiO2 were studied. The photoelectric parameters V-oc = 0.549 V, J(sc) = 0.51 mA/cm(2) and n = 0.21% were obtained with DSSC fabricated using C. fistula sensitized TiO2 photo anode under 100 mW/cm(2) illumination.

AB We show that an azopolymer can be used to create a supramolecular architecture in a parallel process with patterned surface properties. By illuminating with an interference pattern, we created adhesion and charge patterns that reflect the molecular ordering. We studied the recording process in two limit situations. When birefringence dominates over mass transport, an adhesion pattern was recorded even in absence of a surface relief grating (SRG). When mass transport dominates, we measured a higher frequency adhesion and relief patterns on top of the SRG. We measured an increased negative charge in the regions where molecules are expected to be parallel aligned in trans conformational state.

AB The effect of porosity on the transmission behavior of MgAl2O4 was modeled using Mie and Rayleigh-Gans-Debye (RGD) single-scattering theories. The RGD theory showed that the porosity less than 0.01 percent (especially for pore radius less than 70 nm) had no remarkable effect on the transparency of this ceramic. While Mie theory showed that this limit is less than 0.1 percent (especially for pore radius less than 70 nm). At the wavelengths of 550 and 1100 nm respectively and for the porosity higher than 0.01 percent, the pore size had to be smaller than 70 and 90 nm in order to achieve the maximum transmission. To verify the simulation results, the transparent spinel ceramic was used which made by two techniques, gel-casting and cold isostatic pressing (CIP). The strength of the final gel-tasted and CIPed sample was 15.32 and 2.47 MPa, respectively. After spark plasma sintering (SPS), the density of sintered sample was 98.8 and 99.8% respectively with a transmission of 74.1 and 86.8% at the wavelength of 1100 nm. It was found that RGD theory is not as suitable as Mie theory for simulating the transmission of spinel ceramics, because of the high difference between refractive indexes of medium (spinel) and pore. However at shorter wavelength, by considering the scattering coefficient relation of RGD theory, two theories agree well.

AB Rare earth (RE)-doped tungstates and molybdates found many applications in the optical field as laser materials, phosphors or scintillators. Especially, there is a huge challenge to fabricate new RE-doped transparent ceramics from nano-crystalline powders, crystallizing in the cubic structure, for application in optics. However, the knowledge about the structure and spectroscopic properties of these materials crystallizing in the cubic structure is very limited. There is therefore a great need to deepen and complete characterizations of new compositions.
   We are first interested in the most known Nd3+ laser dopant. Our research is focused on synthesis, investigation of morphology and spectroscopic properties of Nd3+-doped cubic Y6MoO12 molybdate solid solutions with various concentration of Nd3+ optical activator (0.07-10 mol%) in the form of nano-crystalline powders obtained by the combustion method at 600 degrees C/3 h (grain size 5-10 nm) and annealed at 800 and 1050 degrees C (grain size 10-20 nm and 35-40 nm, respectively). Obtained samples were compared with micro-powders synthesized by high-temperature solid state reaction at 1550 degrees C (grain size was 4-5 mu m). The detailed XRD analysis of phase transformation with temperature have been performed SEM analysis was performed to confirm the presence of only one phase both for nano and micro-crystalline powders. The powders are homogeneous, porous and if temperature increases, grains tend to agglomerate. Main spectroscopic results are presented in relationship with the average size of grains and the multisite effect of Nd3+ ions, observed by site selective and time-resolved spectroscopies, which, in addition, points out evidence of traces of Nd3+-doped Y2O3.

AB In this paper, a highly sensitive photonic crystal fiber (PCF) based surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor is proposed and analyzed. Well-known hexagonal lattice with all circular air holes as well as metal deposition outside the PCF surface gives this sensor a straightforward design. Using the finite element method (FEM), sensing performances are investigated in the measurement range from 1.33 to 1.40. The maximum amplitude sensitivities are reached to 1086 RIU-1 and 1656 RIU-1 and maximum wavelength sensitivity is obtained about 12,000 nm/RIU for both plasmonic material gold and silver, respectively, in the y-polarized propagation mode. Owing to the simple design and high sensitivity, the proposed biosensor can be applicable to detect the biochemical and biological samples.

AB The concept of sleep health is gaining momentum globally. Rather than "medicalizing" sleep with a focus on sleep disorders and their treatment, there is growing interest in sleep health promotion for all and on the prevention of sleep problems. In Canada, sleep health is increasingly becoming part of a holistic vision of health and provides a metric for health promotion efforts. One of the outcomes of this evolving understanding of sleep health in Canada has been the release of the world's first integrated 24-hour movement guidelines for the pediatric population in 2016. These were the first systematic review-informed sleep guidelines in Canada, and provided important benchmarks for surveillance. They also integrated sleep health with other lifestyle behaviors by putting the emphasis on the full 24-hour period rather than nocturnal sleep duration. Among the possible solutions to counter the adverse effects of insufficient sleep, public health policies are crucial to help prioritizing sleep health in children. The future of pediatric sleep health in Canada is bright, and we need to align our efforts and continue to push for this important topic in the public health arena. It is expected that this action will result in the prioritization of sleep health by the public health community in Canada so that it becomes an equal counterpart to the attention and resources given to other lifestyle behaviors such as healthy nutrition and sufficient amounts of physical activity.

AB Background & Objective: Canadian Ministries of Health and Education across all provinces aim to support and maximize the mental and physical health of students to ensure their ability to fulfill their academic potential. Chronic sleep loss affects all of these domains. However, tools to optimize youth sleep are generally lacking.
   Methods: This manuscript explains the rationale for the integration of sleep health education into schools, describes the barriers to sleep health education, outlines efforts made to address them in Canada, and discusses future directions for sleep health education in Canada.
   Results: There is unequivocal evidence that sleep plays critical roles in achieving the key goals to which Canadian schools are committed. Sleep restriction and poor sleep habits resulting from hectic, demanding, unbalanced lifestyles; pressure for academic success; participation in extracurricular activities; and the low priority given to sleep over competing activities are prevalent in Canadian youth of all ages and may significantly impair their learning, well-being, and health. Attempts to integrate sleep health education into school curricula meet with multiple barriers. Some of these barriers can be overcome by using community-based participation to develop and implement school-based sleep health education programs.
   Conclusion: Successful school-based sleep health promotion programs hold the promise of having a long-lasting positive impact on students' physical and mental health, academic performance and daytime functioning. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background:To date, no longitudinal population-based studies of school start times have been conducted within Canada. School schedule changes provided an opportunity to examine start times in association with youth sleep, physical activity, and screen use over time.
   Methods:This longitudinal study included grade 9-12 students attending 49 Ontario secondary schools that participated in at least two consecutive years of the COMPASS study (2012-2017). Fixed effects models tested whether differences in within-student change in self-reported sleep duration, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and screen time were associated with school start time changes, adjusting for student- (grade, sex, ethnicity, spending money) and school-level covariates (median income, urbanicity, geographical area).
   Results:Thirteen start time changes of 5-10 min were reported. Ten-minute advances at earlier clock times (8:30 AM-8:20 AM; 8:40 AM-8:30 AM) were associated with steeper sleep duration declines than schools with consistent start times but had no effect at later times (9:00 AM-8:50 AM). While sleep change did not differ with 5-min delays, 10-min delays (8:50 AM-9:00 AM) were associated with additional sleep (23.7 min). Apart from one school that shifted from 8:30 AM to 8:35 AM, in which screen time and physical activity decreased more steeply, no effect was found for screen time, and 5-min delays were associated with more physical activity (10.9 min) and advances with less activity (-8.0 min).
   Conclusions:Results support start time delays as a valuable strategy to help ameliorate sleep debt among youth. Interference with physical activity or increased screen time appear unlikely with modest schedule changes. Potential adverse impacts on sleep require consideration with 10-min advances.

AB Aim: To highlight Canada's contributions to the assessment and treatment of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea as well as outline the current state of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea in Canada.
   Methods: A search was conducted in MEDLINE (Ovid) using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and free-text terms for 'child' and 'obstructive sleep apnea' with subsequent 'human' limit. The results were reviewed to identify publications where any author's listed a Canadian institution.
   Results: Canadian contributions to the field of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea have grown over the last 30 years with an increase in number of contributors and centres. Much of the early work stemmed from McGill University with important contributions in examining alternatives to polysomnography and post-adenotonsillectomy respiratory compromise. Today, contributors from centres across the country are engaged in the field and come from a greater diversity of disciplines. With continued challenges and opportunities, Canada will continue to help advance the field of pediatric OSA.
   Conclusion: Canada has a strong community of people invested in continuing to work to improve the lives of Canadian children with pediatric OSA. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives/background: This paper outlines the current state of Canadian training, clinical services, research, and advocacy initiatives related to non-respiratory sleep disorders, with a specific focus on insomnia, the most common sleep problem in children.
   Methods: Information for this narrative review was collected from peer-reviewed publications, web-resources, and personal communications and experiences.
   Results: It is estimated that approximately one-third of Canadian children and youth present with insomnia, and that this is impacting their physical and mental health, as well as learning in school. Training in pediatric sleep is limited and highly inconsistent within and across disciplines. While there are some publicly and privately funded pediatric sleep services available, these are mostly focused on respiratory sleep problems and are not equally accessible across the country.
   Conclusions: Pediatric assessment and treatment services for non-respiratory sleep disorders needs to be more integrated into the Canadian health care system. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pediatric sleep medicine is rapidly evolving in Canada. As pediatric sleep disorders are increasingly recognized, there is a growing need for clinicians educated in the evaluation and treatment of pediatric sleep disorders. Current pediatric sleep resources in Canada are inadequate to meet the needs of the population. Until this year, there was no formal pathway or specific requirements for pediatric sleep disorder medicine training in Canada and exposure to this field of medicine in post-graduate training was limited. In 2018, the Royal College of Physicians of Canada approved an Area of Focused Competence program for certification and maintenance of competence in Sleep Disordered Medicine. It was designed to ensure adequate breadth and depth of training experiences in this diverse field. The goals of the program are to ensure competence in the assessment and management of adults and children with a range of sleep-wake disorders and sleep-disordered breathing, to interpret sleep investigations, to administratively manage a sleep laboratory and to advance the discipline of Sleep Disorder Medicine through research. The program follows a competency-based model in which, within the year of training, trainees accumulate a dossier of experiences which are evaluated by a Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons committee. This new program will ensure that a critical mass of trained sleep medicine physicians is developed to meet the needs of the Canadian pediatric population and to contribute to advancement of the field of pediatric sleep medicine.

AB Objective/background: Rates of suicide attempts in Canadian youths are concerning. Adolescence is a sensitive period for the emergence of both sleep and mood problems, two major risk factors for suicidality. This naturalistic study aimed to define the sleep profile of adolescents under the combined influence of suicidality, depression and pharmacotherapy during hospitalization for a suicidal crisis.
   Patients/methods: Seventeen suicidal adolescents (15.0 + 1.2years, 82% females) with major depression were recruited from a Canadian pedopsychiatric inpatient unit. Seventeen non-depressed adolescents were retrospectively collated from another database (15.0 + 1.1years, 83% females). None of the participants had a history of sleep disorders or significant medical conditions.
   Results: Compared to controls, suicidal adolescents had a longer sleep onset latency (Z = -4.5, p < 0.001), longer REM latency (Z = -3.2, p = 0.001), higher percentage of NREM1 sleep t(33) = -2.6, p = 0.020), and higher REM density (Z = -2.8, p = 0.004) than controls. Higher REM density correlated with higher CDI-II scores (r = 0.55, p = 0.27) A significant interaction indicated that the two groups had similar NREM3 percentages in the first two-thirds of the night, but that the suicidal group had significantly lower NREM3 percentage than the controls in the last third of the night (F(2,66) = 3.4, p = 0.041).
   Conclusions: Significant sleep abnormalities were observed during hospitalization for a suicidal crisis in a sample of depressed and mostly medicated adolescents. This included sleep initiation and REM sleep latency abnormalities, shallower sleep and high REM density. Future studies should decipher the relative effects of depression, suicidality and medication on sleep. These findings stress the need to address sleep disturbances in the management of suicidality in adolescents. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Sleep-related breathing disturbances in adolescents with treatment

SO SLEEP MEDICINE

DT Article
DE Adolescence; Treatment resistant depression; Sleep disordered breathing;
   Sleep apnea; Daytime sleepiness
ID CHILDREN; APNEA; SYMPTOMS; DISORDER
AB Objective/background: A considerable subgroup of adolescents does not respond to standard antidepressant treatments. There are some indications that sleep disordered breathing may contribute to refractory depression in adults, but little is known about how it may relate to the course of depressive disorders in adolescents. Focussing on a group of Canadian adolescents with treatment resistant depression (TRD), this study aimed to investigate how the severity of residual depressive symptoms following unsuccessful antidepressant trials relates to breathing disturbances during sleep.
   Patients/methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted at a tertiary mental health facility. Polysomnography, the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were collated from 18 adolescents (15-18 years old, 44% females) patients with depressive disorders who did not respond to at least two 4-week trials of antidepressant medications.
   Results: Of this sample, 39% reported at least mild levels of excessive daytime sleepiness, and 55% had an apnea/hypopnea index >= 1. Worse depressive symptoms correlated with higher RDI (r = 0.53, p = 0.022). This was mainly driven by respiratory effort-related arousals occurring during NREM sleep (r = 0.52, p = 0.029). No significant correlation was found between depressive symptoms and other respiratory or sleep variables. Higher daytime sleepiness correlated significantly with lower minimum oxygen desaturation (r = -0.51, p = 0.030).
   Conclusions: These results suggest that even subtle respiratory disturbances during sleep may play a role in persistent depressive symptoms and treatment resistance. Early screening for sleep-related breathing disturbances in adolescents with TRD may be relevant, since previous work suggests that treating sleep-related breathing disturbances can attenuate depressive symptoms.

AB Objective: The objective this study was to investigate the relative contributions of gender, common mental health symptoms, and experiences of interpersonal violence to the presence of sleep disturbances in Youth in Care under Child Welfare Society admitted to residential facilities.
   Methods: A sample of 315 teenagers (14-18 years old) completed a self-reported questionnaire upon admission, followed by a medical consultation with a nurse and a physician. Information regarding experiences of interpersonal violence, mental health symptoms, and sleep disturbances was collected using a standardized questionnaire.
   Results: Anxiety, ADHD symptoms, and sexual abuse were associated with sleep disturbances, F(10, 264) = 5.95, p < 0.001. Results from hierarchical regression analyses revealed that experiences of interpersonal violence, more specifically sexual abuse, were associated with sleep disturbances over and beyond gender and the presence of mental health symptoms.
   Conclusions: These results highlight practical implications for health professionals in terms of assessment and intervention for vulnerable youth exposed to interpersonal violence. Implications for research and practice are discussed. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: Childhood adversity figures prominently in the clinical histories of children and adolescents suffering from a panoply of physical, mental or sleep disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder. But the nature and prevalence of early adversity in the case of idiopathic nightmare-prone individuals have received little study. We characterize the types and frequencies of self-reported childhood adversity for nightmare-prone individuals using the developmentally sensitive Traumatic Antecedents Questionnaire (TAQ) and assess relationships between separation adversity and sleep spindles.
   Method: The TAQ was administered to 73 non-treatment-seeking volunteers with frequent idiopathic nightmares and 67 healthy controls. Nightmare severity, anxiety, depression, alexithymia and past and present sleep disorders were also assessed. Sleep was recorded with polysomnography (PSG) for 90 participants and sleep spindles were assessed for 63.
   Results: Nightmare-prone participants scored higher on most TAQ measures, including adversity at 0-6 years of age. TAQ-derived scales assessing traumatic and nontraumatic forms of adversity were both elevated for nightmare-prone participants; for 0-6 year estimates, nontraumatic adversity was associated with nightmares independent of trauma adversity. Group differences were only partially mediated by current psychopathology symptoms and were largely independent of nightmare frequency but not of nightmare distress. Adversity/nightmare relationships were graded differentially for the two study groups. Separation adversity at 0-6 years of age correlated with current sleep spindle anomalies-in particular, lower slow spindle density-an anomaly known to index both psychopathology and early nightmare-onset.
   Conclusions: Self-reported adversity occurring as young as 0-6 years of age is associated with nightmare severity and sleep spindle anomalies. Adversity-linked nightmares may reflect pathophysiological mechanisms common also to the nightmares of pre-clinical and full-blown post-traumatic stress disorder. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: New research suggests that the timing of sleep, or chronotype, affects the mental well-being of adolescents, however evidence of its links to physical health is limited. We investigated the associations between chronotype and various health outcomes and behaviours in a national sample of Canadian adolescents.
   Methods: Data were from the 2014 Canadian Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children survey (29,470 students; ages 10-18). Chronotype was estimated using the midpoint of sleep on weekends, corrected for catch-up sleep. We tested the associations with physical health (headache, stomach ache, back ache, dizziness, overweight, self-rated health) and health behaviours (consumption of fruits, vegetables, sweets, soft drinks, and energy drinks, smoking, physical activity, screen time) using random-effects regressions adjusted for sleep duration and individual, family, and school characteristics.
   Results: The average chronotype was 4: 11 a. m. for boys and 4: 10 for girls. Each 1-h delay in chronotype was associated with more headaches, stomach aches, and back aches [proportional odds ratios (PropORs) 1.08, 1.08, 1.07, respectively (boys), 1.10, 1.10, 1.08, respectively (girls)], and dizziness and worse self-rated health in girls (PropORs 1.10 and 1.09, respectively), but not overweight. A 1-h delay in chronotype also related to daily soft drink consumption [ORs 1.17 (boys), 1.11 (girls)], smoking [ORs 1.23 (boys), 1.37 (girls)], screen time [additional 0.64 h (boys), 0.74 h (girls)], less vegetable consumption in boys (OR 0.96), and daily energy drink consumption in girls (OR 1.42).
   Conclusion: A later chronotype related to worse physical health and unhealthy behaviours in Canadian adolescents. Studies are needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a common complaint in the general population, which may be associated with a wide range of sleep disorders and other medical conditions. Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized primarily by EDS, which involves a substantial burden of illness but is often overlooked or misdiagnosed. In addition to identifying low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin (orexin) levels, evaluation for narcolepsy requires in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG). Polysomnography is the gold standard for diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as well as other sleep disorders. However, the use of home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) to screen for OSA in adults with EDS has increased greatly based on its lower cost, lower technical complexity, and greater convenience, versus PSG. The most commonly used, types 3 and 4, portable monitors for HSAT lack capability for electroencephalogram recording, which is necessary for the diagnosis of narcolepsy and other sleep disorders and is provided by PSG. These limitations, combined with the increased use of HSAT for evaluation of EDS, may further exacerbate the underrecognition of narcolepsy and other hypersomnias, either as primary or comorbid disorders with OSA.
   Adherence to expert consensus guidelines for use of HSAT is essential. Differential clinical characteristics of patients with narcolepsy and OSA may help guide correct diagnosis. Continued EDS in patients diagnosed and treated for OSA may indicate comorbid narcolepsy or another sleep disorder. Although HSAT may diagnose OSA in appropriately selected patients, it cannot rule out or diagnose narcolepsy. Therefore, at present, PSG and MSLT remain the cornerstone for narcolepsy diagnosis.

AB Sleep-related disorders have been reported to have a higher prevalence in multiple sclerosis (MS) than in the general population. They are often undervalued for the presence of more severe physical problems and the occurrence at night, without a direct observation in common clinical practice, but if not recognized and treated they can negatively affect the quality of life causing daytime drowsiness and worsening fatigue. Sleep related disorders most commonly reported in MS are as follows: insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD), restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorders (PLMD). Secondary narcolepsy, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and propriospinal myoclonus have been also described in some case reports or series. The purpose of this review is to correlate the more common sleep disturbances in MS patients to the involvement of specific brain regions, analyzing their relationship with MRI findings. While insomnia is usually secondary to other disabling symptoms such as nocturia or pain, SRBD, RLS, narcolepsy, RBD and propriospinal myoclonus in MS patients can be the consequence of an injury of specific central nervous system (CNS) areas. Lesions in the pontine tegmentum and the dorsal medulla have been associated with SRBD, spinal cord lesions or atrophy with RLS, bilateral lesions in the lateral hypothalamus with narcolepsy-like symptoms, lesions in the dorsal pontine tegmentum with RBD and intramedullary demyelinating plaques in spinal cord with propriospinal myoclonus. MS specialists and general neurologists should be aware of these comorbidities since neuroimaging, which is routinely performed in MS, could provide helpful clinical indications on patients with secondary sleep-related disorders and to categorize symptomatic patients who need to underdo more in-depth sleep studies.

   MODEL
AB Objectives: Pre-sleep arousal and time monitoring behavior are two putative factors involved in the development and maintenance of insomnia. We investigate two questionnaires measuring these factors in good sleepers and patients with insomnia.
   Participants: A sample of 96 patients with non-organic insomnia according to ICD-10 and 208 good sleepers completed the Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS), the Time Monitoring Behavior-10 scale (TMB-10), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-II, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).
   Methods: In this study, 95% quantile cut-off scores were determined for good sleeper in the age and gender mathed subgroups of the insomnia group. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine variables predicting above-threshold values in the two target questionnaires. Included predictors were age, gender as well as ISI, BDI-II, STAI-1 and -2 total scores.
   Results: Good sleepers showed 95% quantiles between 12.2 and 23.8 for PSAS and between 7.5 and 12.7 for TMB-10. Approximately 40% of patients with insomnia had scores above these cut-offs for PSAS and ca. 25% for TMB-10. Female gender and anxiety were variables associated with scores above cut-off on the PSAS. Insomnia severity and anxiety were associated with scores above cut-off on the TMB-10.
   Conclusions: These findings underline the importance of PSAS and TMB-10 in the diagnostic investigation of insomnia and indicate that time monitoring is related to increased insomnia severity. Further research may investigate the impact of the corresponding two constructs on response rates to cognitivebehavioral treatment for insomnia. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Little is known about the prevalence and impact of insomnia on clinical outcomes in youth with obsessiveecompulsive disorder (OCD). This study aimed to investigate this subject.
   Patients/methods: A total of 193 patients from a specialist pediatric OCD clinic completed a range of diagnostic and clinical measures, including the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Patients scoring above a previously validated cut-off on the ISI (score >= 9) were compared to the rest of the sample on socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. In a subsample of 143 (from the initial 193) patients who were treated at the clinic, a mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the outcomes of multimodal OCD treatment in the insomnia (N = 60) vs no insomnia (N = 83) groups. The primary outcome measure was the clinician-administered Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) at post-treatment and at three-month follow-up.
   Results: The psychometric properties of the ISI in our sample were excellent. At baseline, 42% (81/193) of the sample scored above the ISI cut-off for clinical insomnia. These participants had significantly higher OCD severity, higher rates of psychiatric comorbidities, more severe depressive symptoms, poorer general functioning, and were more likely to take sleep medications, compared to those who scored below the ISI cut-off. In the treated subsample, while the insomnia group remained more severely affected through the three time-points, both groups improved similarly on the CY-BOCS at post-treatment and at three-month follow-up.
   Conclusion: Insomnia is relatively common in pediatric OCD and is associated with more severe psychopathology. However, with adequate multimodal, evidence-based treatment, these patients can improve as much as those without insomnia. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Sleep improves memory for the content but not execution of intentions in
   adolescents
SO SLEEP MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Prospective memory; Adolescence; Memory consolidation
ID SPONTANEOUS RETRIEVAL; COST
AB Objective: Sleep benefits prospective memory in young adults probably in part due to its wellestablished role in enhancing declarative memory, thereby facilitating retrieval of the intention content. In prior work on adolescents, we did not detect differences in prospective memory comparing five nights of sleep restriction and adequate sleep. Here, we examined whether this might be attributed to a limited role of sleep in benefiting the declarative content in this age group, and whether a sleep benefit on prospective memory would be uncovered with a shorter retention interval.
   Methods: A total of 59 adolescents (mean +/- standard deviation:16.55 +/- 0.94 years) were instructed to remember to press a special key in response to two target words embedded in a semantic categorization task. Memory was tested after a 12-h retention interval, which included either overnight sleep (21:00-09:00, n = 29) or daytime wakefulness (09:00-21:00, n = 30).
   Results: We found no significant group difference in the percentage of target words correctly responded to (mean +/- standard error of the mean for the sleep group:32.76 +/- 6.69%; wake group:41.67 +/- 7.61%, t = 0.88, p = 0.38). However, participants who slept recalled more target words compared to those who stayed awake (98.28 +/- 1.72% vs. 86.67 +/- 5.32%, t = 2.05, p < 0.05). In addition, a significantly greater proportion of sleep participants (n = 28 of 29) compared to wake participants (n = 24 of 30) recalled both target words correctly (chi(2) = 3.76, p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that during adolescence, sleep plays a more prominent role in improving memory for the content as compared to the execution of intentions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Although obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a known risk factor for perioperative complications in various patient cohorts data is lacking for patients undergoing hysterectomies, one of the most frequently performed surgeries among women. Using national data we therefore aimed to assess the risk in this patient group.
   Materials and methods: We extracted data on patients who underwent a hysterectomy between 2006 and 2014 from a large nationwide database (n = 459,508). OSA patients (identified by ICD-9 CM codes) were compared to non-OSA patients regarding perioperative outcomes: cardiac, central-nervous, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, renal, respiratory, and thromboembolic complications; as well as opioid prescription, need for blood transfusion, cost of hospitalization, length of stay and ICU admission. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported.
   Results: Overall, 2.67% (n = 11,936) of patients were identified as having OSA. Compared to non-OSA patients, OSA was particularly associated with higher odds for renal (OR 1.98; 95% CI 1.70-2.32) and respiratory complications (OR 3.25; 95% CI 2.97-3.56), and ICU admission (OR 2.28; 95% CI 1.77-2.94). Further, while significant, OSA was associated with modestly increased cost of hospitalization (+/- 6.24%; P < 0.0001) and length of stay (+/- 2.58%; P < 0.0001).
   Conclusions: In patients undergoing hysterectomies, OSA was associated with substantially increased risk of complications and modestly increased resource utilization. Further research is needed to assess currently used perioperative care strategies for OSA patients undergoing hysterectomies, with the goal to improve outcomes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI Predictive factors of obstructive sleep apnoea in patients with fibrotic

AB Background and aim: Several studies reported a high prevalence of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) or restrictive end-stage lung disease (ESLD). Besides the known risk factors for OSA like high Body Mass Index (BMI), reduced static and dynamic volumes for IPF patients and reduced DLCO and low minimal O-2 saturation during sleep for ESLD patients were associated with higher Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI). The aim of our study was to determine potential predictive factors of OSA in patients with Fibrotic Lung Diseases (FLD).
   Materials and methods: In this study, 49 patients with FLD and BMI <= 30 kg/m(2) were included. All patients underwent portable cardiorespiratory polysomnography (PSG) and were asked to fill in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Their epidemiological, medication and subsidiary exams data were retrieved from their hospital records. Univariate and multivariate correlation models were obtained.
   Results: Approximately 70% of patients had an AHI >= 5 events/h. In an univariate correlation model, AHI showed a statistically significant correlation with age, BMI, the duration of immunosuppressant treatment, and Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV1). Only BMI remained an independent predictor of OSA in a multivariate correlation model adjusted for the other statistically meaningful variables.
   Conclusions: FLD patients, in general, show a prevalence of OSA superior to that of the general population. Excess of weight might predict a higher risk for OSA in FLD patients. Larger and more homogenous studies are warranted to clarify the associations between OSA severity and lung function impairment and the duration of immunosuppressant treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objectives: To investigate whether baseline electromyography (EMG) activity during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep predicts the development of neurodegenerative diseases over time in patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD).
   Methods: A total of 216 patients with polysomnography-confirmed iRBD were recruited from September 1997 to December 2016 with a mean follow-up duration of 5.0 +/- 3.7 years (median: 4.0, range: 0.5-19.0). Neurodegenerative diseases were ascertained according to standard diagnostic criteria during follow-up. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were employed to evaluate the dynamic predictive performance of EMG activity over time. Both tonic and phasic EMG activity were dichotomized into 'mild' and 'severe' categories by the ROC curves estimated optimal cut-offs.
   Results: A total of 58 patients (26.9%) developed neurodegenerative diseases. The predictive performance of tonic EMG activity was stable (area under the curve of approximately 0.68) over time, while the performance of phasic EMG activity was significantly superior to chance only after five years of follow-up. The optimal cut-off for prediction at five years was 15.4% (sensitivity, 0.69; specificity, 0.57) and 7.8% (sensitivity, 0.79; specificity, 0.47) for tonic and phasic EMG activity, respectively. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses further revealed that severe tonic (adjusted HR: 2.76, 95% CI: 1.35-5.62) and phasic EMG activity (adjusted HR: 3.10, 95% CI: 1.10-8.71) were associated with early development of Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), respectively.
   Conclusions: Tonic but not phasic EMG activity may serve as a stable biomarkers for predicting the progression of neurodegeneration in iRBD. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   INDEX; METAANALYSIS; ADULTS; HYPERTENSION; ZOLPIDEM; PERCEPTIONS;
   VALIDATION; MANAGEMENT
AB Objectives: To examine the potential moderating effect of objectively measured sleep duration at baseline on the response to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), administered singly or combined with medication (CBT-I + Med).
   Methods: Based on the average PSG-derived sleep duration across two baseline nights and the type of treatment received, 159 adults with insomnia (50.3 +/- 10.1 years; 61.0% women) were classified into one of four groups: participants with short sleep duration (ie, <= 6 h) treated with CBT-I (n = 26) or CBT-I+Med (n = 25), and participants with normal sleep duration (ie, > 6 h) treated with CBT-I (n = 54) or CBT-I+Med (n = 54). Primary outcome measures were sleep/wake parameters derived from a sleep diary and insomnia severity and secondary outcomes were beliefs about sleep, fatigue, depression and anxiety.
   Results: Patients with both short and normal sleep durations at baseline improved significantly on most sleep continuity parameters with CBT-I administered singly or combined with medication. Irrespective of treatment received, participants with short sleep duration also showed significantly greater improvements in subjective sleep (ie, reduced wake after sleep onset, increased sleep efficiency) relative to those with normal sleep duration. Conversely, participants with normal sleep duration showed greater improvements on some measures of daytime functioning and sleep satisfaction.
   Conclusions: There was no moderating effect of baseline sleep duration on treatment response to cognitive behavioral therapy. Despite some marginal differential treatment response on selected daytime functioning outcomes, the benefits from CBT-I were not significantly different as a function of short or normal sleep duration at baseline. Further prospective investigation of insomnia phenotypes taking into account other variables than sleep duration is warranted in order to develop more targeted insomnia therapies.

TI Stress-related sleep reactivity is associated with insomnia,
   psychopathology and suicidality in pregnant women: preliminary results

DE Pregnancy; Insomnia; Sleep reactivity; Anxiety; Depression; Suicidality

   SYMPTOMS; IDEATION; MOOD
AB Introduction: Depression and anxiety symptoms are commonly experienced by women during pregnancy and may have negative consequences on mothers and newborns. Deterioration of sleep quality throughout pregnancy increases insomnia, which may lead to adverse outcomes including increased psychopathology in the perinatal period. Thus, identifying women at high risk of developing insomnia may have important clinical implications on maternal-fetal outcomes. Stress-related sleep reactivity is a well-established risk factor for future insomnia, depression, and anxiety in general adult samples. However, little is known of sleep reactivity and its relations to sleep and mood pathology in pregnancy. Therefore, we explored sleep reactivity in pregnant women and its relations to prenatal symptoms of insomnia, depression, anxiety, and suicidality.
   Method: Sixty-two pregnant women (mean age 33.6 +/- 3 years, 20.6 +/- 0.6 weeks of pregnancy) were evaluated during their routine visit at the Gynecological Unit of the University of Pisa, Italy, using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) for insomnia symptoms, the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test for sleep reactivity (FIRST), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) for depressive symptoms, and the Zung Self Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) for anxiety symptoms. Item #10 of the EPDS was used to assess for suicidality. Differences in means between women with high vs low stress-related sleep reactivity were calculated using t-test or Mann-Whitney U/Wilcoxon test. Linear/multiple regression analyses have been performed to study associations between variables.
   Results: Pregnant women with high stress-related sleep reactivity, relative to those with low reactivity, reported greater symptoms of insomnia (t = 6.5, 0.004) as well as higher rates of depression (62.0% vs 6.1%, p < 0.001), anxiety (55.1% vs 15.1%, p = 0.030), and suicidality (17.2% vs 3.0%, p = 0.025). Multivariate models revealed sleep reactivity to correlate independently with symptoms of insomnia, depression, and anxiety, when controlling for comorbid symptoms.
   Conclusions: In mid-pregnancy, women with high sleep reactivity report elevated symptoms of insomnia, depression, and anxiety, and are more likely to endorse suicidal ideation. As a prognostic marker of future insomnia and psychiatric illness, early detection of high prenatal sleep reactivity holds potential to prevent the development of sleep and mood pathology during pregnancy, thereby potentially improving maternal and child outcomes.

AB Background: Being a major health risk and very prevalent in the population, sleep problems are an important health care issue.
   Methods: We used the 2017 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to study the prevalence of sleep problems and the use of mind body medicine (MBM) among individuals with sleep problems in a representative sample of the US population (N = 26,742). Using chi-squared tests and backward stepwise multiple logistic regression analyses, predictors of sleep problems and of MBM use in the past 12 months were identified.
   Results: The prevalence of sleep problems was 49.3%, with higher prevalence being associated with higher age, being female, being non-Hispanic White, and higher education. Among individuals with sleep problems, 29.8% used MBM vs. only 17.5% without. Being less than 30 years of age, female, non-Hispanic White, living in the Western US, having a higher education, and being diagnosed with heart disease predicted MBM use among individual's with sleep problems. Yoga (16.3%), spiritual meditation (13.6%), and mindfulness meditation (7.5%) were the most used MBM approaches.
   Conclusion: The characteristics of individuals with sleep problems were largely in line with the literature, while notably Whites were more prone to sleep problems than other ethnicities. MBM treatments commonly used were yoga, spiritual meditation and mindfulness meditation; although evidence supports its use for sleep problems, tai chi was used rarely by the wider population. Further studies should explore reasons for ethnical differences in MBM use and why some effective MBM approaches are not commonly used. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive method, and its application in the treatment of primary insomnia (PI) is poorly researched. PI is considered to be a functional disorder with abnormal brain network connections. TMS combined electroencephalography (EEG) is a valuable method for directly probing excitability and dynamic connectivity of different regions in the brain. We aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of rTMS and its impact on brain network connections in PI patients.
   Methods: Twenty patients with PI were recruited in this study and received 1 Hz rTMS treatment for 14 consecutive days. The severity of symptoms was evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Twenty minutes TMS-EEG were performed before and immediately after treatment. EEG data was collected by 10-20 EEG system with the sample rate of 1024 Hz. Time-varying EEG network was analyzed using the adaptive directed transfer function. The EEG network results of patients were compared with those of 20 healthy subjects.
   Results: In the present study, we found that PSQI, ISI, and ESS ratings of the patients decreased significantly (P < 0.05) after rTMS treatment, and the improvement in ratings lasted one month. Compared with healthy subjects, single-pulse TMS targeting right posterior parietal cortex of PI patients before therapy showed excessive information outflow from the left occipital region, the frontal mid-line region and the right posterior temporal region, in succession. Meanwhile, inadequate information outflow was seen in the right central region, right parietal region, as well as in the right temporal region. Compared with prior treatment, PI patients showed increased information outflow in the left temporal region and decreased information outflow in the frontal mid-line region.
   Conclusion: Low frequency rTMS targeting the right posterior parietal cortex has significant positive effects on the treatment of PI that can last for at least one month and can reverse abnormal changes of time-varying EEG networks. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Shift work encompasses a broad range of work time arrangements. However, how shift work affects the circadian expression of clock genes remains to be explored. The objective of this study was to evaluate the pattern of clock gene expression in shift workers in the field.
   Methods: We examined clock gene expression in Japanese men who work: (1) one night shift followed by a day off (caregivers: nurses and doctors; the one-night group); (2) three or more consecutive night shifts (factory workers; the consecutive-night group); or (3) daytime only (the daytime group), using beard follicle samples. The expression of Period3, Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1 Group D Member 1 (Nr1d1), and Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1 Group D Member 2 (Nr1d2) was examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
   Results: Period3 expression in the daytime and one-night groups together with Nr1d2 expression in the one-night group fitted a 24-h-period cosine curve better than in the consecutive-night group (p = 0.004, 0.012, and 0.001, respectively). The level of overall Period3 gene expression, calibrated with that of 18S-rRNA, was decreased in the consecutive-night group compared with that in the daytime group (p = 0.006). The patterns of Period3 and Nr1d2 expression in the daytime and one-night groups were more coherent than those in the consecutive-night group.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that night shift work affects the rhythms and levels of circadian Period3 and Nr1d2 expression dependent on the shift schedule or type of the shift; however, there is substantial variation between individuals. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is associated with pathological changes of cerebral beta-amyloid dynamics. Orexin has been demonstrated interfering with beta-amyloid metabolism in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology. The present study investigated cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) beta-amyloid(40) (A beta(40)), beta-amyloid(42) (A beta(42)) and orexin levels in OSA patients compared to AD patients and controls.
   Methods: OSA and AD patients were included in this study and compared to a group of controls. Patients and controls underwent lumbar puncture for the assessment of CSF A beta(40), A beta(42), tau proteins, orexin levels, and polysomnography to measure nocturnal sleep architecture.
   Results: 20 OSA patients, 20 AD patients, and 15 controls were included in our study. OSA patients showed higher CSF orexin levels than AD patients and controls, and AD patients showed higher CSF orexin levels than controls. Moreover, CSF A beta(40) and A beta(42) were lower in OSA patients than controls, but higher in OSA patients compared to AD patients. However, AD patients showed lower CSF A beta(42) levels but comparable CSF A beta(40) levels than controls. Sleep macrostructure was similarly altered in OSA and AD patients compared to controls. Finally, the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was related to the ratio A beta(42)/A beta(40) and CSF orexin levels in OSA patients.
   Conclusion: This study proved the alteration of CSF orexin levels and beta-amyloid isoforms 40 and 42 in OSA patients. We suppose that sleep disruption and intermittent hypoxia, the two core features of OSA, may induce orexinergic system and cerebral beta-amyloid metabolism dysregulation. This evidence further supports the current hypothesis that OSA may possibly start AD neuropathological processes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor and common morbidity for stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). However, screening for OSA in patients with stroke or TIA is uncommonly performed, due in part to difficulties associated with conducting polysomnography (PSG) and Home Sleep Apnea Tests (HSATs). The 8-point "STOP-BANG" questionnaire has been shown to have high methodological quality in screening for OSA. This study examined the clinical utility of a modified version of the "STOP-BANG" questionnaire, which removed neck circumference and included nocturnal oxygen desaturation in diagnosing OSA (ie, the "STOP-BAG-O" tool), with the goal of improving uptake and accuracy in diagnosing OSA.
   Methods: In total, 231 participants completed both the STOP-BAG questionnaire and PSG or HSAT within 12 months of stroke/TIA. Using receiver-operating curves, scores on the "STOP-BAG-O" and "STOP-BAG" questionnaires were assessed for their ability to predict a diagnosis of OSA and classify at least 50% of the study population.
   Results: Compared to an OSA diagnosis of AHI >= 10, the STOP-BAG (using cut-offs of <= 3 and >= 4) had a sensitivity and specificity of 83.5% and 67.2%, respectively. The STOP-BAG-O (using cut-offs of <= 3 and >= 5) had a sensitivity and specificity of 95.9% and 78.4%, respectively. For all AHI cut-offs used, the area under the curve for the STOP-BAG-O was greater and statistically different (p < 0.001) than that for the STOP-BAG.
   Conclusions: The STOP-BAG-O is a valid tool for identifying risk of OSA post-stroke/TIA. The simplicity of this tool and ease of assessing nocturnal oxygen desaturation makes it a feasible option for widespread use. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Oral appliances for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) reduce upper airway collapse by advancing the mandible (OAm) and associated soft tissues. OAm are well tolerated but have side effects, mainly dental movement. It is not yet clear whether there are irreversible skeletal changes associated with treatment. As oral appliance treatment for OSA is a life-long therapy, careful and extended follow-up of patients is required. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the magnitude and progression of the dental and skeletal changes associated with long-term treatment, in addition to determining the predictors of the changes.
   Methods: Lateral cephalograms of adults treated for primary snoring or mild to severe OSA with a custom-made titratable OAm for a minimum of eight years were retrospectively studied. The magnitude and rate of progression of any changes over time was determined and initial patient and dental characteristics were investigated as possible predictors of the observed side effects.
   Results: Records of 62 patients with an average treatment time of 12.6 years (range: 8-21 years) were included. Cephalometric analysis revealed significant (p < 0.001) maxillary incisor retroclination (mean of approximate to 6 degrees) and mandibular incisor proclination (mean of approximate to 8 degrees) over the observation period. Maxillary incisors demonstrated a constant rate of retroclination -0.5 degrees/year, the rate of mandibular incisors proclination was variable. The number of treatment years was significantly associated with these variables (p < 0.001). A greater body mass index (BMI) and Subspinale, Nasion, Supramentale angle (ANB) were associated with more maxillary and mandibular incisor proclination respectively. Although statistically significant (p < 0.001) skeletal changes were noted over this extended observation period, the difference in the Sella, Nasion, Supramentale point B (SNB) and mandibular plane angles were approximately 1 degrees and were deemed not clinically significant.
   Conclusions: This study represents the longest observation period to date examining OAm side effects with up to 21 years of follow up for some patients. It confirms that there are significant and progressive dental changes with prolonged OAm use. Conversely, over the same time period skeletal or postural changes were negligible. Additionally, treatment duration was the predictor consistently associated with the magnitude of the observed side effects. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The popularity of biofeedback as a non-pharmacological treatment option for insomnia has increased in recent times despite inconsistent empirical evidence for its therapeutic efficacy.
   Objective: The purpose of the current review was to systematically assess the efficacy of using biofeedback to treat insomnia.
   Methods and results: A search of electronic databases (PubMED, MEDLINE, OvidSP, Ovid EMBASE, PsychInfo, The Cochrane Library including Cochrane Reviews), clinical trials databases and registries (Clinical Trials Database [US], Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry [ANZCTR]) and online journal (eg, SLEEP, Sleep Medicine) identified 92 studies. Of these, 50 publications were descriptive or review papers about use of biofeedback for the treatment of insomnia, while an additional 37 did not meet the detailed inclusion criteria (ie not original research, participants do not meet the diagnostic criteria for insomnia). Six full-text articles met inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Methodological flaws including poor study design (small sample size, lack of control group) limit the validity of the body of work in this field to date and fail adequately to account for other unspecified factors likely to drive the observed changes, such as care and attention of those administering the treatment, as well as the expectations and motivations of the patient.
   Conclusion: There is an urgent need for future studies to clarify the role of unspecific placebo effects when reporting biofeedback effects for the treatment of insomnia. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: Maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy have been associated with poor offspring sleep. Yet, it remains unknown whether depressive symptoms throughout pregnancy are more harmful to the child than depressive symptoms only during certain time periods in pregnancy, whether associations are specific to pregnancy stage, whether maternal symptomatology after pregnancy mediates or adds to the prenatal effects, and whether any effects are specific to some child sleep characteristics.
   Methods: A total of 2321 mothers from the Prediction and Prevention of Pre-eclampsia and Intrauterine Growth Restriction (PREDO) study completed the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale biweekly between gestational weeks thorn days 12 + 0/13 + 6 and 38 + 0/39 + 6. At child's mean age of 3.5 (standard deviation = 0.7) years, mothers completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II and answered questions on child sleep quantity and quality using the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) and sleep disorders using the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children.
   Results: Maternal depressive symptoms showed high stability throughout pregnancy. Children of mothers with clinically significant symptomatology throughout pregnancy had shorter mother-rated sleep duration, longer sleep latency, higher odds for waking up two or more times during the night and for total and several specific sleep disorders. These associations were robust to covariates. However, maternal depressive symptoms at the child follow-up fully mediated the associations with sleep duration and awakenings, partially mediated those with sleep latency and disorders, and added to the effects on sleep disorders.
   Conclusion: Maternal depressive symptoms throughout pregnancy are associated with mother-rated child sleep quantity, quality, and disorders. Maternal depressive symptoms at child follow-up mediate and add to the prenatal adverse effects on child sleep characteristics. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Study objectives: Excessive screen time in child and adolescent populations is associated with short sleep duration, but the unique effects of portable vs. non-portable electronic devices has received little attention. Moreover, it is unknown whether the effects of these devices change across childhood. To address these gaps, the current study compared the association of portable vs. non-portable electronic devices with sleep duration throughout childhood.
   Methods: Data were from a 2016 national survey of the caregivers of 43,755 children and adolescents ages 0-17 administered by the U.S. Census Bureau.
   Results: Children and adolescents who spent more time on screens slept fewer hours and were more likely to get insufficient sleep. In multivariate regressions including time spent on TV and video game consoles and portable electronic devices, associations with sleep duration were primarily due to portable electronic devices. These results remained when demographic variables, diagnoses of anxiety or depression, physical activity, and BMI were included in the model. Moreover, time spent using both portable and non-portable devices was important for sleep duration in children under age 10, but the importance of non-portable devices diminished in children over 10.
   Conclusions: Spending multiple hours a day on electronic devices is associated with shorter sleep duration across all ages. However, portable electronic devices have a stronger association with sleep duration than non-portable electronic screens, with non-portable devices less relevant for sleep duration in children over age 10. The findings suggest that future interventions should uniquely target portable electronic devices while also accounting for the age group of children targeted. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ID NIGHTLY TREATMENT; VALIDATION; SLEEP
AB Objective: Suvorexant is an orexin receptor antagonist that is approved in the US, Japan and Australia for the treatment of insomnia. Using outcomes from the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) in the core registration studies, we explored suvorexant effects on sleep problems and their impact on daytime function.
   Methods: Data were pooled from two similar Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, three-month trials in elderly (>= 65 years) and non-elderly (18-64 years old) insomnia patients. Age-adjusted (non-elderly/elderly) dose-regimes of 40/30 mg and 20/15 mg were evaluated. The ISI, a 7-item self-rated questionnaire with each item rated on 0-4 scale (higher score corresponds to increasing severity), was administered to patients as an exploratory assessment in both studies at baseline and one and three months after randomization.
   Results: The analysis included 1824 patients. Suvorexant improved change-from-baseline ISI total scores to a greater extent than placebo (Month three: 20/15 mg = -6.2, 40/30 mg = -6.7, placebo = -4.9, p-values for both active arms vs. placebo < 0.001) and resulted in a greater proportion of responders than placebo using a variety of definitions (eg, >= 6-point improvement from baseline at Month three: 20/15 mg = 55.5%, 40/30 mg = 54.9%, placebo = 42.2%, p-values for both active arms vs. placebo <0.001). Additionally, the "impact of insomnia" component, which assesses the impact of insomnia on daytime function/quality-of-life, was improved to a greater extent by suvorexant than placebo.
   Conclusions: Suvorexant 20/15 mg and 40/30 mg improved sleep to a greater extent than placebo as assessed by the ISI in patients with insomnia. Improvement in sleep onset/maintenance as well as a reduction of the impact of sleep problems on daytime function contributed to the overall improvement observed in ISI total score.

AB We analysed intestinal tissues from groups of fast growing (Ross 308) broilers with natural or experimental coccidiosis, by genomic microarray. We identified genes that were differentially expressed (DE) in all groups and analysed expression of a panel of these, by qPCR, in Ross 308 and slow growing (Ranger classic) broilers, infected with 2500 or 7000 oocysts of Eimeria maxima for 6 or 13 days post-infection (dpi). Four genes (ADD3, MLLT10, NAV2 and PLXNA2) were upregulated (P < 0.05) in Ross 308 but were not DE in Ranger Classic at 6 dpi with 2500 oocysts. Six genes (PTPRF, NCOR1, CSF3, SGK1, CROR and CD1B) were upregulated (P < 0.05) in both Ross 308 and Ranger Classic infected with 2500 oocysts at 6 dpi but were not DE at 6 dpi with 7000 oocysts. At 13 dpi with 7000 oocysts, NAV2 and NCOR1 were upregulated in Ross 308 (P < 0.05) and PTPRF was upregulated in both genotypes (P < 0.05). DE of immune genes within the biomarker panel also occurred, with CSF3 upregulated in both genotypes infected with 2500 oocysts at 6 dpi and in Ranger Classic infected with 7000 oocysts, at 6 and 13 dpi (P < 0.05). IL-22 was down-regulated in Ranger Classic infected with 2500 or 7000 oocysts at 6 dpi (P < 0.05) but upregulated in both genotypes at 13 dpi (P < 0.05). CD72 was down-regulated in Ranger Classic infected with 2500 oocysts at 6 dpi and with 7000 oocysts at 6 and 13 dpi (P < 0.05). CD72 was upregulated in Ross 308 infected with 2500 oocysts at 6 dpi but was down-regulated following infection with 7000 oocysts at 13 dpi (P < 0.05). In conclusion, differential gene expression occurs in fast and slow growing broiler genotypes with coccidiosis. In addition, we highlight a potential genetic biomarker panel for early diagnosis of coccidiosis.

AB The prevalence of C. daubneyi infection in the United Kingdom has increased, but despite the potential for rumen flukes to cause production loss in ruminant livestock, understanding of their emergence and spread is poor. Here we describe the development of a method to explore the multiplicity of C. daubneyi infection and patterns of the parasite's emergence and spread, based on Illumina MiSeq deep sequencing of meta barcoded amplicons of a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (mt-COX-1) locus. Our results show high levels of genetic diversity in 32 C. daubneyi populations derived from finished prime cattle consigned to slaughter from northern United Kingdom. The results are consistent with a single introduction of C. daubneyi infection to some of the farms where the cattle had been grazed during their lifetime and multiple introductions to most. The results illustrate the impact of high levels of animal movements in the United Kingdom, whereby multiple common mt-COX-1 haplotypes were identified in 26 populations in the absence of geographical clustering of clades. This has implications for the adaptability of environmental and intermediate host stages of the parasite to changing climatic and animal management conditions, or of parasitic stages to exposure to anthelmintic drugs; potentially allowing for greater pathogenicity, or the development of anthelmintic resistance, respectively.

TI Inflammasome activation restrains the intracellular Neospora caninum
   proliferation in bovine macrophages
SO VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Neospora caninum; Bovine macrophages; Inflammasome; Parasite replication
ID PYROPTOSIS; PARASITES
AB Neospora caninum is an intracellular parasite that causes neosporosis in cattle. Bovine neosporosis is considered a major cause of bovine abortion worldwide. Rapid replication of N. caninum tachyzoites within host cells is responsible for the acute phase of N. caninum infection. Evidence shows that the host immune response plays an essential role in recognizing and regulating the replication of invading pathogens. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain receptors (NLRB) are a class of cytoplasmic sensors that can sense pathogens and induce the formation of the inflammasome complex. Activation of the inflammasome promotes restriction of microbial replication. Our previous study revealed NLRP3 inflammasome activation in N. caninum-infected murine macrophages. However, the role of inflammasome activity in N. caninum-infected bovine cells is unknown. To address this question, a bovine peritoneal macrophage cell line was used to investigate the role of inflammasome activation in regulating intracellular N. caninum replication. The results showed that inflammasome mediated activation of caspase-1 occurs in N. caninum-infected bovine macrophages, and caspase-l-dependent cell death was considered to be induced in N. caninum-infected bovine macrophages because N. caninum induced cell death decreased following pretreatment with zVAD-fmk and VX765. Meanwhile, the inhibition of caspase-1 in N. caninum-infected bovine macrophages led to the presence of more parasites in the parasitophorous vacuole. In contrast, inflammasome activation induced by ATP treatment in N. caninum-infected bovine macrophages contributed to the clearance of N. caninum. In addition, pyroptotic cell supernatant collected from ATP-stimulated bovine macrophages also impaired the ability of this parasite to infect new cells. In conclusion, this study is the first report on the role of the bovine inflammasome in restraining intracellular N. caninum replication and suggests that the bovine inflammasome may be a potential target for future development of drugs or vaccines against N. caninum infection in cattle.

AB Fasciolosis, a food- and waterborne infection caused by the trematodes Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica, is recognized by WHO as a neglected zoonotic disease. Whereas F. hepatica is distributed worldwide in cooler climates, F. gigantica occurs mainly in the tropics of Africa and Asia. The southern Caucasus, with Armenia, is one of the most northern regions where both species occur and may produce hybrids. In this study, livestock in central Armenia was surveyed for fasciolosis, the causative species were determined and the genetic diversity of both species was estimated. Total prevalence in sheep (1794), cattle (324) and goats (9) was 21.2%, 15.7% and 44.4%, respectively. After morphological identification and sequencing of a mitochondrial (nadl) and a nuclear marker gene (28S rRNA), 62 collected specimens were allocated to F. hepatica (n = 55) and F. gigantica (n = 7). Intraspecific diversity was evaluated for the complete nadl gene, resulting in 29 haplotypes of F. hepatica and six haplotypes of F. gigantica. Diversity was higher among F. gigantica than F. hepatica in the Armenian sample set, a difference that was confirmed analyzing available sequences for both species worldwide. Maximum genetic distance between haplotypes in global networks was 49 nucleotide steps for F. gigantica compared to 15 for F. hepatica. In the available sample sets, F. hepatica showed higher diversity in western Asia and the Middle East compared to Europe and eastern Asia, while for F. gigantica loosely structured clusters comprising mainly western/southern Asian and African haplotypes could be identified. A distinct clade comprising haplotypes from Zambia was basal in the phylogenetic tree. Biogeographical implications of these data are discussed.

AB This study developed and evaluated Giardia duodenalis cyst propagation using a dexamethasone immuno-suppressed CF-1 mouse model as an alternative to a previously described Mongolian gerbil model. The CF-1 mouse model shed significantly more cysts per animal during a 16-18h collection period compared to the gerbil (averages: 7.8 x 10(6) cysts/CF-1 mouse and 2.5 x 10(6) cysts/gerbil). In addition, the patency period for this model differed from both G. muris in mice and G. duodenalis in gerbils in that cysts were shed continuously for over 20 days. Results further showed that the beta-giardin gene sequences from gerbil derived and mouse derived G. duodenalis were identical, after 34 serial passages through the CF-1 mouse model. Overall, the CF-1 mouse model produced higher concentrations of cysts per animal, and were genetically and phenotypically stable based on beta-giardin gene sequences.

AB In the veterinary field, there is a great concern about the issue of acaricides resistance in cattle ticks. A comparative study was designed to evaluate the in vitro acaricidal efficacy of imidacloprid nano-emulsion, zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs), silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), deltamethrin, deltamethrin-ZnO NPs, and deltamethrin-Ag NPs. In addition, the novel formulations of deltamethrin (deltamethrin-ZnO NPs and deltamethrin-Ag NPs) against Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus were also evaluated by in vivo animal efficacy trials. Nanoparticles and their loaded forms, deltamethrin-Ag NPs and deltamethrin-ZnO NPs, were characterized by Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectrum (FTIR). The adulticidal activity of deltamethrin-ZnO NPs at different concentrations; 2 mL/L, 1 mL/L, 0.5 mL/L and 0.25 mL/L induced a significant (P <= 0.05) lethal effect on adult ticks compared to deltamethrin-Ag NPs at the same concentrations. The larvicidal efficacy of deltamethrin-ZnO NPs resulted in a complete larval mortality within 24 h of exposure, while deltamethrin and deltamethrin-Ag NPs exhibited 100% immobility of larvae 48 h post-exposure. Furthermore, the in vivo experiments showed a considerable reduction in the tick's survival after using deltamethrin-ZnO NPs. There was no significant effect of different treatments on liver or kidney function tests at pre- and post-treatment of animals. In conclusion, deltamethrin-ZnO nanocomposite was the most effective adulticide and larvicide against R. (B.) annulatus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report for using deltamethrin-ZnO NPs as an acaricide.

AB Parasite control in foals is complicated by the concurrent presence of biologically diverse parasites with differing levels of anthelmintic resistance. Several combination anthelmintic products are available for use in horses, but information on their efficacies against important equine parasites is scarce. Two trials were performed in New Zealand during 2008 and 2011 on four different farms with substantially different anthelmintic treatment histories. The first trial evaluated the efficacy of an ivermectin/praziquantel/oxibendazole combination, a single active oxibendazole, and a single-active macrocyclic lactone (ML) in 49 foals located on three farms. The second trial evaluated two combination anthelmintic products and three single-active ML products and enrolled a total of 110 foals on three farms. Foals in the second trial were allocated to one of six anthelmintic treatment groups; oxfendazole/pyrantel embonate, pyrantel embonate/ivermectin/praziquantel, ivermectin/praziquantel, abamectin/praziquantel, moxidectin/praziquantel, and a placebo-treated control. In both trials, foals were monitored monthly prior to treatment, and fecal egg counts (FECs) of Parascaris spp., strongylid, and Strongyloides westeri were determined. A "rolling enrolment" process was implemented whereby foals were systematically allocated to a treatment group and treated with the corresponding anthelmintic following the first appearance of Parascaris spp. eggs in the faeces. A generalised linear model was used to evaluate the effect of farm and treatment on Day14 FEC (ln) for each parasite. Three different FECR calculation methods were employed as follows; i) FECR(T) pre and post treatment ii) FECR (C) in the treated group compared with control, and iii) FECR (P) pre- and post-treatment in the treated and control groups. Across both trials, treatment with ML single active products failed to achieve > 95% reduction in Parascaris spp. FEC on two of three farms. The pyrantel embonate/oxfendazole and ivermectin/ praziquantel/oxibendazole combinations demonstrated full efficacy against Parascaris spp. This is in contrast to the anti-strongylid efficacies determined, where the pyrantel embonate/oxfendazole combination and single active oxibendazole had reduced efficacy on one farm, while the macrocyclic lactones generally had good efficacy. Strongyloides egg counts were sporadic in both trials, and allowed limited insight into anthelmintic efficacy. The study illustrated the importance of keeping an untreated or placebo-treated control group in studies evaluating anti-Parascaris efficacy and it demonstrated the utility of a rolling enrolment procedure, where foals are enrolled over the course of a defined period of time. Furthermore, the study demonstrated the value of a farm specific FECR monitoring programme and the complexity of parasite control in foals, where combination anthelmintic products can be employed to target multiple species of parasites.

AB A model was developed to reproduce the dynamics of the parasitic stages of equine cyathostomins. Based on a detailed review of published literature, a deterministic simulation model was constructed using the escalator boxcar-train approach, which allows for fully-overlapping cohorts of worms and approximately normally distributed variations in age/size classes. Key biological features include a declining establishment of ingested infective stage larvae as horses age. Development rates are constant for all the parasitic stages except the encysted early third stage larvae, for which development rates are variable to reflect the sometimes extended arrestment of this stage. For these, development is slowed in the presence of adult worms in the intestinal lumen, and when ingestion of infective larvae on herbage is high or extended. In the absence of anthelmintic treatments, the life span of adult worms is approximately 12 months, and the presence of an established adult worm burden largely blocks the transition of luminal fourth stage larvae to the adult stage, resulting in mortality of the larvae. This inhibition is removed by effective anthelmintic treatment allowing the rapid replacement of adult worms from the pool of mucosal stages.
   Within the model, the rate and seasonality at which infective stage larvae are ingested strongly influences the dynamics of the pre-adult stages. While the adult worm burden remains relatively stable within a year, due to the negative feedback they have on developing stages, the numbers and proportions of larval stages relative to the total worm burden increase with the numbers of infective larvae ingested. Further, within the model, the seasonal rise and fall of encysted stages is largely driven by the seasonal pattern of infective larvae on pasture. Because of this, the model reproduces the contrasting seasonal patterns of mucosal larvae, typical of temperate and tropical environments, using only the appropriate seasonality of larvae on pasture. Thus, the model reproduces output typical of different climatic regions and suggests that observed patterns of arrested development may simply reflect the numbers and seasonality of free-living stages on pasture as determined by different management practices and weather patterns.

AB The emergence of resistance to chemical acaricides in Dermanyssus gallinae, together with their toxicity and high costs, has prompted investigations into the use of plant extracts as alternatives to chemical acaricidal treatments. Drimia maritima bulbs and Dittrichia viscosa (D. viscosa) leaf extracts were here characterized by HPLC-PDA-ESI-MS/MS, and their toxicity against D. gallinae was evaluated using contact methods. Twenty-nine compounds were identified in D. maritima extracts, with glucoscilliphaeoside derivatives (i.e., quercetin, kaempferol and bufadienolides) as the major components. Twenty-four phenolic compounds, mainly caffeic acid derivatives, were detected in D. viscosa extracts. D. maritima extracts displayed a significantly higher (p < 0.05) acaricidal activity than D. viscosa extracts, with 100% of D. gallinae mortality at a concentration of 100 mg/mL following 24 h exposure. The mortality rate of D. gallinae induced by D. viscosa extracts ranged from 25 to 45% following 48 h exposure at a concentration of 200 mg/mL. The acetonic extract of D. viscosa and D. maritima displayed the highest efficacy against D. gallinae. This study provides evidence of the diversity of bioactive compounds present in D. maritima bulbs and D. viscosa leaf extracts, which are both efficacious against D. gallinae. The higher efficacy of D. maritima bulb extracts might be linked to the presence of bufadienolides in its extracts.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a strategic deworming program on Ascaris suum infection levels and technical performance parameters in fattening pigs. Eighteen fattening stables were selected and divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 9 stables in which the fattening pigs tested seropositive for Ascaris, indicative for the presence of Ascaris eggs in the stable, whereas group 2 consisted of 9 stables in which the fattening pigs tested seronegative for Ascaris, indicating of a low or absent environmental contamination with Ascaris eggs. The production in each stable was monitored for a period of 7 consecutive fattening rounds. The first of these 7 fattening rounds (i.e. round 0), during which no intervention took place in the deworming strategy applied in the stable, served as a historical control. A deworming program using 200 mg/ml fenbendazole oral suspension in drinking water for 2 days every 6 weeks was implemented for a period of 6 consecutive fattening rounds. For each fattening round and for each stable, technical performance parameters including average daily growth, feed conversion ratio, days in fattening and the percentage of affected livers were obtained from the producers. Blood was collected from 10 randomly selected animals per stable at the end of each fattening round and evaluated for the presence of anti-Ascaris antibodies using 2 different serological tests, namely the AsHb- and the L3-Lung ELISA. The serological results obtained indicated a lower exposure of the animals to Ascaris after the implementation of a strategic deworming program. A significant decline in anti-Ascaris antibody levels was detectable in the stables that originally tested positive for Ascaris and was already visible after one treatment round. The outcomes of hierarchical linear mixed models indicated that the level of L3-Lung antibody reactivity was a significant predictor of decreased ADG, increased FCR and prolonged DIF for the Ascaris-positive herds, indicating an effect of Ascaris infections on productivity.

AB The infection of ruminants by Fasciola spp. always induces a non-protective Th2-type immune response. However, little is known about changes in the local and systemic immune environment during F. gigantica migration in buffalo. In this study, native swamp buffaloes were each infected with 500 viable F. gigantica metacercariae. Mesenteric lymph node (MLN), hepatic lymph node (HLN), spleen, and serum samples were collected from control and infected buffaloes at 3, 10, 28, 42, 70, and 98 days post-infection (DPI). The mRNA expression levels of the Th1- and Th2-related cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and CD4 were measured during different infection stages in the MLNs, spleens, and HLNs using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Levels of the specific anti-ESP isotype antibodies IgG, IgG1, and IgG2 were used to reflect changes in humoral immunity. The results of this study indicated that swamp buffaloes were susceptible to F. gigantica infection, and that susceptibility to this infection was closely related to the cytokine environment associated with the Th2-type immune response. The MLNs showed a mixed Th1- and Th2-type immune response during the acute infection stages, after which the production of these cytokines returned to normal. Cytokine expression in the HLNs also expressed a mixed Th1- and Th2-type immune response during the early infection stages. When the infection became chronic, the typical Th2 immune response was induced in the HLNs. At the acute infection stages, the spleen exhibited a Th2 immune response. Nevertheless, cytokines associated with the Th1 and Th2 immune responses were upregulated at 98 DPI. In addition, the total IgG and IgG1 of the parasite specific antibodies increased. This suggested that the Th2-related cytokines and IgG1 induced by F. gigantica infection might mediate successful F. gigantica infection in the natural host, swamp buffalo.

AB This study aimed to determine the relationship between the variation in plasma concentration of ivermectin 3.15% over time and its efficacy against the cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus. In addition, a trial was conducted to infer if the application of successive treatments with ivermectin 3.15% could affect its accumulation in cattle. A noticeable variation of ivermectin plasma concentration was observed among the treated heifers. However, these differences did not have a significant effect onthe therapeutic efficacy of the treatment at the end of the trial. No significant differences were observed in the levels of tick infestations between heifers of the treated group; moreover, no significant correlation was detected between the plasma AUC(0.21) of ivermectin 3.15% and the cumulative number of ticks of each heifer. Levels of therapeutic efficacy higher than 80% were observed only from day 7 post-treatment, when levels of ivermectin concentration were higher than 8 ng/ml. The lowest values of therapeutic efficacy were observed during the first and the second days post-treatment, when plasma concentrations of ivermectin 3.15% were lower than 8 ng/ml. Viable engorged females were collected from the heifers belonging to the treated group from days 1-5 post-treatment. There was a significant accumulation of the drug after the second dose of ivermectin 3.15%. Ivermectin concentrations in fat biopsies were 366 ng/g (51 days after the first treatment), 275 ng/g (51 days after the second treatment) and 15 ng/g (64 days after the second treatment). These results suggest that applications of successive treatments with ivermectin 3.15% might increase its accumulation in cattle tissues, extending the withdrawal period indicated for the commercial formulation.

AB Dourine, caused by Trypanosoma equiperdum, is a life-threatening venereal disease in equidae. So far, there is no clear evidence on how and when stallions become infectious, nor which tissues are affected by the parasite in diseased animals. Post-infection, after a transient, temporary phase of parasitaemia, the parasite disperses to different tissues in an unknown distribution pattern. This study describes the distribution of the parasite after infection by artificial insemination (Al) or blood transfusion. Mares (N = 4) were artificially inseminated with T. equiperdum spiked semen whereas stallions (N = 4) were infected by blood transfusion. The course of the disease was monitored by parasitological (Woo) and molecular (PCR) tests and clinical signs and haematological parameters were recorded. At 120 days post infection, horses had a full necropsy, histopathology and PCR. A similar pattern of parasitaemia, disease progression and tissue distribution were seen in all horses. Ejaculated semen in the preclinical stage and epididymal semen in the chronic stage of the disease was positive on PCR and caused infection in mice. Cymelarsan treatment in the chronic stage did not result in a clinico-haematological or histopathological improvement. At necropsy, lesions were observed in the nervous and reproductive system. Histopathological lesions were most severe in the peripheral nerves and associated ganglia, the testicles and genital mucosae with multifocal infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells and histocytes. The parasites disseminated to several tissues including the nervous system, testicles and semen. The results indicate that transmission of T. equiperdum is possible through semen even from symptomless stallions post-treatment.

AB New vector control tools that can fit into a broader integrated vector management strategy are notably lacking. We conducted a seven-month randomized trial to assess the efficacy of a single oral dose of Fluralaner (Bravecto (R)) administered to dogs on the blood-feeding success, engorgement levels and mortality of pyrethroid-resistant and-susceptible Triatoma infestans third- and fifth-instar nymphs. The trial included 10 Fluralaner-treated and 10 placebo-treated (control) outbred healthy dogs residing in rural houses of the Argentine Chaco. Most (92.7%) of the 3017 triatomines exposed were able to blood-feed. Generalized linear models showed that blood-feeding success was not significantly modified by Fluralaner treatment, time posttreatment and their interaction. However, pyrethroid-susceptible fifth instars blood-fed significantly more frequently than susceptible third instars, and no significant differences were observed between the latter and resistant fifth instars. Engorgement levels were not significantly modified by Fluralaner treatment, time posttreatment and their interaction. Nearly all the triatomines that blood-fed on treated dogs up to 60 days posttreatment (DPT) died within 24 h regardless of pyrethroid susceptibility status combined with bug stage. Cumulative bug mortality over 4 days postexposure remained high over 90-120 DPT (70-81% in susceptible third and fifth instars, and 47-49% in resistant fifth instars), and was virtually nil at 210 DPT. Triatomines that fed on control dogs suffered marginal mortality (0-4%) except at 4 and 30 DPT. Fluralaner and xenointoxication are eligible for Phase III efficacy trials alone or combined with other methods in the frame of an integrated vector management strategy in areas with or without pyrethroid resistance.

AB Significant progress has been made in obtaining structural insight into the assembly of the beta-barrel assembly machinery complex (BAM). These crystallography and electron microscopy studies used detergent as a membrane mimetic and revealed structural variations in the central domain, BamA, as well as in the lipoprotein BamC. We have used cellular solid-state NMR spectroscopy to examine the entire BamABCDE complex in native outer membranes and obtained data on the BamCDE subcomplex in outer membranes, in addition to synthetic bilayers. To reduce spectral crowding, we utilized proton-detected experiments and employed amino-acid specific isotope-labelling in (C-13, C-13) correlation experiments. Taken together, the results provide insight into the overall fold and assembly of the BAM complex in native membranes, in particular regarding the structural flexibility of BamC in the absence of the core unit BamA.

AB REMORINs are nanodomain-organized proteins located in the plasma membrane and involved in cellular responses in plants. The dynamic assembly of the membrane nanodomains represents an essential tool of the versatile membrane barriers to control and modulate cellular functions. Nevertheless, the assembly mechanisms and protein organization strategies of nanodomains are poorly understood and many structural aspects are difficult to visualize. Using an ensemble of biophysical approaches, including solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, cryo-electron microscopy and in vivo confocal imaging, we provide first insights on the role and the structural mechanisms of REMORIN trimerization. Our results suggest that the formation of REMORIN coiledcoil trimers is essential for membrane recruitment and promotes REMORIN assembly in vitro into long filaments by trimer-trimer interactions that might participate in nanoclustering into membrane domains in vivo.

AB Many membrane proteins sense and induce membrane curvature for function, but structural information about how proteins modulate their structures to cause membrane curvature is sparse. We review our recent solid-state NMR studies of two virus membrane proteins whose conformational equilibrium is tightly coupled to membrane curvature. The influenza M2 proton channel has a drug-binding site in the transmembrane (TM) pore. Previous chemical shift data indicated that this pore-binding site is lost in an M2 construct that contains the TM domain and a curvature-inducing amphipathic helix. We have now obtained chemical shift perturbation, protein-drug proximity, and drug orientation data that indicate that the pore-binding site is restored when the full cytoplasmic domain is present. This finding indicates that the curvature-inducing amphipathic helix distorts the TM structure to interfere with drug binding, while the cytoplasmic tail attenuates this effect. In the second example, we review our studies of a parainfluenza virus fusion protein that merges the cell membrane and the virus envelope during virus entry. Chemical shifts of two hydrophobic domains of the protein indicate that both domains have membrane-dependent backbone conformations, with the beta-strand structure dominating in negative-curvature phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) membranes. P-31 NMR spectra and H-1-P-31 correlation spectra indicate that the beta-strand-rich conformation induces saddle-splay curvature to PE membranes and dehydrates them, thus stabilizing the hemifusion state. These results highlight the indispensable role of solid-state NMR to simultaneously determine membrane protein structures and characterize the membrane curvature in which these protein structures exist.

AB High-order assemblies of amelogenin, the major protein in enamel protein matrix, are believed to act as the template for enamel mineral formation. The Leucine-rich amelogenin (LRAP) is a natural splice-variant of amelogenin, a functional protein in vivo, containing conserved domains of amelogenin. In this work, we showed LRAP aggregates hierarchically into assemblies with various sizes including scattered beads, beads-on-a-string and gel-like precipitations in the presence of both calcium and phosphate ions. Solid-state NMR combined with X-ray diffraction and microscopic techniques, was applied to give a picture of LRAP self-assemblies at the atomic level. Our results, for the first time, confirmed LRAP assemblies with different sizes all contained a consistent rigid segment with beta-sheet secondary structure (residues 12-27) and the beta-sheet segment would further assemble into amyloid-like structures.

AB The C-terminally truncated Y145Stop variant of prion protein (PrP23-144), which is associated with heritable PrP cerebral amyloid angiopathy in humans and also capable of triggering a transmissible prion disease in mice, serves as a useful in vitro model for investigating the molecular and structural basis of amyloid strains and cross-seeding specificities. Here, we determine the protein-solvent interfaces in human PrP23-144 amyloid fibrils generated from recombinant C-13, N-15-enriched protein and incubated in aqueous solution containing paramagnetic Cu(II)-EDTA, by measuring residue-specific 15 N longitudinal paramagnetic relaxation enhancements using two-dimensional magic-angle spinning solid-state NMR spectroscopy. To further probe the interactions of the amyloid core residues with solvent molecules we perform complementary measurements of amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange detected by solid-state NMR and solution NMR methods. The solvent accessibility data are evaluated in the context of the structural model for human PrP23-144 amyloid.

AB Intra-neuronal aggregation of alpha-synuclein into fibrils is the molecular basis for alpha-synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease. The atomic structure of human alpha-synuclein (hAS) fibrils was recently determined by Tuttle et al. using solid-state NMR (ssNMR). The previous study found that hAS fibrils are composed of a single protofilament. Here, we have investigated the structure of mouse alpha-synuclein (mAS) fibrils by STEM and isotope-dilution ssNMR experiments. We found that in contrast to hAS, mAS fibrils consist of two or even three protofilaments which are connected by rather weak interactions in between them. Although the number of protofilaments appears to be different between hAS and mAS, we found that they have a remarkably similar secondary structure and protofilament 3D structure as judged by secondary chemical shifts and intra-molecular distance restraints. We conclude that the two mutant sites between hAS and mAS (positions 53 and 87) in the fibril core region are crucial for determining the quaternary structure of alpha-synuclein fibrils.

AB Whole-cell protein profiling, spatial localization, and quantification of activities such as gene transcription and protein translation are possible with modern biochemical and biophysical techniques. Yet, addressing questions of overall compositional changes within a cell - capturing the relative amounts of protein and ribosomal RNA levels and lipid content simultaneously - would require extractions and purifications with caveats due to isolation yields and detection methods. A holistic view of cellular composition would aid in the study of cellular composition and function. Here, solid state NMR is used to identify C-13 NMR signatures for cellular organelles in HeLa cells without the use of any isotopic labeling. Comparisons are made with carbon spectra of subcellular assemblies including DNA, lipids, ribosomes, nuclei and mitochondria. Whole-cell comparisons are made with different mammalian cells lines, with red blood cells that lack nuclei and organelles, and with Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Furthermore, treatment of mammalian cells with cycloheximide, a commonly used protein synthesis inhibitor, revealed unanticipated changes consistent with a significant increase in protein glycosylation, obvious at the whole cell level. Thus, we demonstrate that solid-state NMR serves as a unique analytical tool to catalog and compare the ratios of distinct carbon types in cells and serves as a discovery tool to reveal the workings of inhibitors such as cycloheximide on whole-cell biochemistry.

AB Krokinobacter eikastus rhodopsin 2 (KR2) is a pentameric, light-driven ion pump, which selectively transports sodium or protons. The mechanism of ion selectivity and transfer is unknown. By using conventional as well as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)-enhanced solid-state NMR, we were able to analyse the retinal polyene chain between positions C10 and C15 as well as the Schiff base nitrogen in the KR2 resting state. In addition, 50% of the KR2 C-13 and N-15 resonances could be assigned by multidimensional high-field solid-state NMR experiments. Assigned residues include part of the NDQ motif as well as sodium binding sites. Based on these data, the structural effects of the H30A mutation, which seems to shift the ion selectivity of KR2 primarily to Na+, could be analysed. Our data show that it causes long-range effects within the retinal binding pocket and at the extracellular Na+ binding site, which can be explained by perturbations of interactions across the protomer interfaces within the KR2 complex. This study is complemented by data from time-resolved optical spectroscopy.

AB The bacterial cell wall is composed of the peptidoglycan (PG), a large polymer that maintains the integrity of the bacterial cell. Due to its multi-gigadalton size, heterogeneity, and dynamics, atomic-resolution studies are inherently complex. Solid-state NMR is an important technique to gain insight into its structure, dynamics and interactions. Here, we explore the possibilities to study the PG with ultra-fast (100 kHz) magic-angle spinning NMR. We demonstrate that highly resolved spectra can be obtained, and show strategies to obtain site-specific resonance assignments and distance information. We also explore the use of proton-proton correlation experiments, thus opening the way for NMR studies of intact cell walls without the need for isotope labeling.

AB Many advances in instrumentation and methodology have furthered the use of solid-state NMR as a technique for determining the structures and studying the dynamics of molecules involved in complex biological assemblies. Solid-state NMR does not require large crystals, has no inherent size limit, and with appropriate isotopic labeling schemes, supports solving one component of a complex assembly at a time. It is complementary to cryo-EM, in that it provides local, atomic-level detail that can be modeled into larger-scale structures. This review focuses on the development of high-field MAS instrumentation and methodology; including probe design, benchmarking strategies, labeling schemes, and experiments that enable the use of quadrupolar nuclei in biomolecular NMR. Current challenges facing solid-state NMR of biological assemblies and new directions in this dynamic research area are also discussed.

AB Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) is an effective approach to alleviate the inherently low sensitivity of solid-state NMR (ssNMR) under magic angle spinning (MAS) towards large-sized multi-domain complexes and assemblies. DNP relies on a polarization transfer at cryogenic temperatures from unpaired electrons to adjacent nuclei upon continuous microwave irradiation. This is usually made possible via the addition in the sample of a polarizing agent. The first pioneering experiments on biomolecular assemblies were reported in the early 2000s on bacteriophages and membrane proteins. Since then, DNP has experienced tremendous advances, with the development of extremely efficient polarizing agents or with the introduction of new microwaves sources, suitable for NMR experiments at very high magnetic fields (currently up to 900 MHz). After a brief introduction, several experimental aspects of DNP enhanced NMR spectroscopy applied to biomolecular assemblies are discussed. Recent demonstration experiments of the method on viral capsids, the type III and IV bacterial secretion systems, ribosome and membrane proteins are then described.

AB Solid state NMR (SSNMR) has earned a substantial success in the characterization of paramagnetic systems over the last decades. Nowadays, the resolution and sensitivity of solid state NMR in biological molecules has improved significantly and these advancements can be translated into the study of paramagnetic biomolecules. However, the electronic properties of different metal centers affect the quality of their SSNMR spectra differently, and not all systems turn out to be equally easy to approach by this technique. In this review we will try to give an overview of the properties of different paramagnetic centers and how they can be used to increase the chances of experimental success.

AB Nitrogen remobilization is a key issue in plants. Recent studies in Arabidopsis thaliana have revealed that nucleoside catabolism supplies xanthine, a nitrogen-rich compound, to the purine ring catabolic pathway, which liberates ammonia from xanthine for reassimilation into amino acids. Similarly, pyrimidine nuclosides are degraded and the pyrimidine bases are fully catabolized. During nucleoside hydrolysis, ribose is released, and ATP-dependent ribokinase (RBSK) phosphorylates ribose to ribose-5'-phosphate to allow its entry into central metabolism recycling the sugar carbons from nucleosides. In this study, we report the crystal structure of RBSK from Arapidopsis thaliana (AtRBSK) in three different ligation states: an unliganded state, a ternary complex with ribose and ATP, and a binary complex with ATP in the presence of Mg2+. In the monomeric conformation, AtRBSK is highly homologous to bacterial RBSKs, including the binding sites for a monovalent cation, ribose, and ATP. Its dimeric conformation, however, does not exhibit the noticeable ligand-induced changes that were observed in bacterial orthologs. Only in the presence of Mg2+, ATP in the binary complex adopts a catalytically competent conformation, providing a mode of action for Mg2+ in AtRBSK activity. The structural data combined with activity analyses of mutants allowed assignment of functional roles for the active site residues. Overall, this study provides the first structural characterization of plant RBSK, and experimentally validates a previous hypothetical model concerning the general reaction mechanism of RBSK.

AB Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a new world alphavirus which can be involved in several central nervous system disorders such as encephalitis and meningitis. The VEEV genome codes for 4 non-structural proteins (nsP), of which nsP3 contains a Macro domain. Macro domains (MD) can be found as stand-alone proteins or embedded within larger proteins in viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes. Their most common feature is the binding of ADP-ribose (ADPr), while several macro domains act as ribosylation writers, erasers or readers. Alphavirus MD erase ribosylation but their precise contribution in viral replication is still under investigation. NMR-driven titration experiments of ADPr in solution with the VEEV macro domain (in apo- and complex state) show that it adopts a suitable conformation for ADPr binding. Specific experiments indicate that the flexibility of the loops beta 5-alpha 3 and alpha 3-beta 6 is critical for formation of the complex and assists a wrapping mechanism for ADPr binding. Furthermore, along with this sequence of events, the VEEV MD undergoes a conformational exchange process between the apo state and a low-populated "dark" conformational state.

AB Teeth are subjected to compressive loads during mastication. Under small loads the soft tissue periodontal ligament (PDL) deforms most. However when the loads increase and the PDL is highly compressed, the tooth and the alveolar bone supporting the tooth, begin to deform. Here we report on the structure of this alveolar bone in the upper furcation region of the first molars of mature minipigs. Using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of bone cross-sections, we show that this bone is hypermineralized, containing abundant small pores around 1-5 mu m in diameter, lacunae around 10-20 mu m as well as larger spaces. This bone does not possess the typical lamellar motif or other repeating structures normally found in cortical or trabecular mammalian bone. We also use high resolution focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) in the serial surface mode to image the 3D organization of the demineralized bone matrix. We show that the upper furcation bone matrix has a disordered isotropic structure composed mainly of individual collagen fibrils with no preferred orientation, as well as highly staining material that is probably proteoglycans. Much larger aligned arrays of collagen fibers - presumably Sharpey's fibers - are embedded in this material. This unusual furcation bone material is similar to the disordered material found in human lamellar bone. In the upper furcation region this disordered bone comprises almost all the volume excluding Sharpey's fibers. We surmise that this most unusual bone type functions to resist the repeating compressive loads incurred by molars during mastication.

AB One way to reconcile an issue associating with the harvesting of microalgal biomass is via the application of attached growth cultivation mode, whereby the mature microalgal biomass can be facilely harvested from the support material. Accordingly, the objectives of present works were to model the attached growth of Chlorella vulgaris onto polyurethane foam support material in a fluidized bed bioreactor while simultaneously bior-emediating real nutrients-rich wastewater and biofixing CO2 for biodiesel production. The mathematical models accounting the impact of various interactions between light intensities and CO2 concentrations in culture medium on growing attached microalgal biomass were initially improved. The successful practicality of models was confirmed from the analysis of statistical accuracy while predicting the growth of attached microalgal biomass in real nutrients-rich wastewater. When the microalgal growth reached the stationary growth phase, all the nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous sources of compounds) were completed impoverished, accentuating the bioremediation potentiality in satisfying the effluent discharged requirements. Subsequently, the modeling of microalgal CO2 biofixation also unveiled that the highest CO2 biofixation rate was transpiring in parallel with the growth rate of attached microalgal biomass during the exponential growth phase. Upon the harvesting, the neutral lipid from mature attached microalgal biomass was found to contain 97.7% (by wt. of lipid) of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) mixture, heralding the biodiesel purity. Assessment of biodiesel quality showed a balance composition among the saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated FAMEs mixture with high in C16 and C18 FAME species for the materialization of efficient combustion.

AB Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of biomass with HZSM-5 coupled with SiC as microwave-absorbent in a downdraft reactor is a promising method for obtaining hydrocarbon-rich bio-oil. The hydrocarbon content limits the economic and commercial viability of the bio-oil produced by pyrolysis. In this study, the effects of catalytic temperature, feedstock-to-catalyst ratio, and WHSV on the yield and composition of bio-oil are studied. In addition, this study compared the influence of downdraft reaction and updraft reaction on the yield and composition of bio-oil. Furthermore, the stability of the catalyst is studied. Catalytic temperature and feedstock-to-catalyst ratio played pivotal roles in the yield and composition of bio-oil. WHSV has minimal influence on the bio-oil yield and composition within the scope of our research. Furthermore, the optimal catalytic temperature, feedstock-to-catalyst ratio and WHSV were 400 degrees C, 2:1, and 72h(-1), respectively. The results illustrated that the downdraft coupled with the microwave-absorbent was conducive to the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons. The HZSM-5 performed well in five replicate experimental cycles under optimal conditions in terms of bio-oil yield and aromatic hydrocarbon yield.

AB The hydrogen production potential and cost from waste heat recovered from condensing steam in a combined heat and power facility has been calculated. Two different concepts for using the recovered energy by an organic Rankine cycle in PEM water electrolysis have been developed and compared. Thermo-economic analysis has been employed to calculate the exergetic unit cost of the produced hydrogen as function of ORC working fluid, steam condensing pressure and hours of available waste heat per year for a mass flow rate of 10 kg/s of condensing steam between 80 kPa and 200 kPa condenser pressure in the steam cycle. Hydrogen production rates in the range from 0.647 to 1.27 g H-2 /kg steam were obtained. The exergetic unit cost of uncompressed, compressed (350 bar) and liquefied hydrogen were calculated. Costs as low as $3.06/kg H-2 (uncompressed) could be achieved, when the use of waste heat was maximised. The lowest cost of compressed (350 bar) and liquefied hydrogen were $4.11/kg H-2 and $16.53/kg H-2, respectively. Depending on the chosen scenario, between 186 and 364 tonne hydrogen can be produced annually.

AB With high oxygen content, Polyoxymethylene Dimethyl Ether 3 (PODE3) is a potential fuel additive to reduce soot emissions. However, reaction mechanisms to describe PODE3 combustion are not yet compact enough for 3D numerical simulations. Therefore, the current work aims to develop a small yet reliable PODE3 reaction mechanism. Based on sensitivity analysis, the major reaction pathway is identified to construct the PODE3 sub-mechanism. Thereafter, it is integrated with a primary reference fuel (PRF) mechanism to create a PRF-PODE3 mechanism containing 61 species and 190 reactions. The major reaction pathway of the PODE3 sub-mechanism consists of only 11 species and 17 reactions. Furthermore, the new mechanism has been well validated with experimental results in terms of ignition delay times (rapid compression machine at pressures = 1.0 MPa and 1.5 MPa, equivalence ratios = 0.5, 1.0 and 1 5), laminar flame speeds (P-in= 1atm, T-in= 408 K), flame species concentrations (pressure = 33.3 mbar, equivalence ratio = 1) and homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion (equivalence ratios = 0.18 and 0.34). Overall, this highly compact yet robust PRF-PODE3 mechanism is demonstrated to be suitable for internal combustion engine simulations. In addition, with good agreement in terms of fundamental combustion validations, the proposed PRF-PODE3 mechanism can reasonably be applied to other practical applications such as simulations in jet engines, pulse detonation engines, boilers and furnaces.

AB This paper presented a multidisciplinary optimization methodology of a high altitude solar-powered hybrid airship. A multidisciplinary model of the hybrid airship is proposed including the geometry, aerodynamics, structures, propulsions and energy consisting of the photovoltaic array and energy stored system (ESS). To achieve a continuous flight and reduce the total mass and energy cost, a multi-phase strategy including the climb, daytime cruise, glide and nighttime cruise is proposed. The mission-based optimization is achieved through an enhanced collaborative optimization and the result shows a large decrease in the total mass compared with a baseline design.
   Since the flight altitude has a great influence on the hybrid airship with the multi-phase strategy, a multiobjective optimization achieved by NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sort Genetic Algorithm-II), is carried out to discuss the design tradeoffs in different altitudes. The result also indicates that the multi-objective optimization provides a solution set so that the optimal design of the hybrid airship in different flight altitudes could be obtained.

AB Internal combustion engines are well spread in traditional power-generation systems: given their reliability, low-cost and performance it is desirable to avoid their full substitution in the short term, but, rather, to rely on the reduction of their environmental impact. This can be achieved by implementing solutions that involve minor modifications on the devices, such as the use of different fuels. In this work, the fossil fuels replacement approach has been applied to a micro-cogeneration system based on a small water-cooled compression ignition engine. The effect of bioethanol introduction as a diesel substitute in six diesel-biodiesel blends has been studied in terms of performances of the whole energy-conversion system and of the exhaust gas emissions. Positive results have been obtained showing that with a small amount (3%) of bioethanol, enhancements can be fulfilled both on performances (with approximately an average 13%-boost of the electrical and thermal efficiency) and emissions (reaching nearly a 80% of smoke opacity reduction).

AB The compound intake possesses large port area. Applying it in Wankel rotary engine (WRE) could increase volumetric efficiency and reduce pumping loss. To investigate the effect of the compound intake on the mixture formation and combustion process in gasoline WREs with hydrogen port and direct injected (HPI and HDI) enrichment, a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was established and validated. Investigation results showed that the peripheral-ported intake flow plays a leading role in the compound-ported WRE. Because the peripheral-ported intake flow has the same direction with the rotor movement, the formation time of mainstream flow field is shortened and the mean flow speed is increased, the flame propagation in the same direction with mainstream flow field is accelerated. Meanwhile, the improvements in volumetric efficiency and quality of in-charged mixtures result in the rise of temperature and pressure at spark timing, which could also improve the initial thermal conditions. Therefore, the compound intake effectively accelerates the combustion process in WRE. In HPI conditions, compared with the side-ported WRE, the peak in-cylinder pressure and indicated thermal efficiency in compound-ported WRE are respectively increased by 4.5% and 3.9%. In HDI conditions, the flame could propagate to the rear combustion chamber and eliminate the unburned zone, the maximum in-cylinder pressure and indicated thermal efficiency in side-ported WRE with HDI are 84.7% and 6.6% higher than those of in side-ported WRE with HPI. At the same time, the compound intake could further increase the in-cylinder pressure and indicated thermal efficiency by 6.8% and 2.5%, respectively. However, the improved combustion performance increases the in-cylinder temperature, which provides a suitable thermal-atmosphere for nitrogen oxide (NOx) formation. The compound intake increases mass fractions of NOx emissions from 0.111% to 0.141% in HPI conditions and those from 0.268% to 0.284% in HDI conditions. Considering the compound intake promotes the combustion characteristics and effectively decreases carbon monoxide (CO) emission from 0.043% to 0.033% in HPI conditions, and from 0.008% to 0.003% in HDI conditions, it is a feasible way to improve the performance of WREs. Especially, combining it with HDI could obtain a better engine performance under low engine speed and part load conditions.

AB Paraffin is one of preferred entrant phase change material (PCM) for the thermal energy storage (TES) based heat sink application. Encapsulation is one of the preferred methods to address the inherent issue with paraffin such as volume expansion, spillage and low bulk thermal conductivity. In this study, describes the synthesis, characterization and heat transfer performance of micro-encapsulated (ME) paraffin of average size similar to 64 mu m by insitu polymerization method. To conquer the adverse effect of reduced thermal diffusion in the bulk ME PCM, a thermal percolation by low melt alloy (LMA: Bi (32%), Sn (59%), Zn (4%) and In (5%)) of similar to 16% volume was incorporated. The characterization results show the form-stability and thermal degradation of PCM. The experiment with heat sink was conducted with fin and without finned heat sink for power levels of 1.57, 2.45, 3.61, 4.49 and 5.51 kW/m(2). The results reveal the promising role of ME PCM/LMA in keeping the heat sink without fin at a lower temperature for a prolonged duration. Obtained an enhancement ratio of 1.87-2.57 and 2.06-3.58 in time to reach set point temperatures of 55 and 65 degrees C with heat load of 1.57-5.51 kW/m(2) LMA percolation. The complete melting and more uniform temperature distribution in the PCM occurred within the operating temperature. Moreover, the recovery time of heat sink also diminished radically. Based on the results, the ME PCM can conquer the adverse effect due to the above mentioned drawback of conventional paraffin and the LMA percolation layer gives a prompt thermal response compared with fins of same volume fraction in the heat sink.

AB Among district heating technologies, gas-fired boiler has difficulty in recovering flue gas waste heat and conventional heat pump has poor performance at low ambient temperature. In the present work, a novel gas-fired absorption heat pump is proposed. High-grade sensible heat and low-grade latent heat of the flue gas is recovered in the solution preheater and intermediate evaporator successively. Moreover intermediate evaporation and absorption processes are introduced, and the intermediate pressure is adjusted according to the ambient temperature, to improve the system adaptability in cold regions. Simulation results show that the coefficient of performance (COP), primary energy efficiency and exergy efficiency are 1.69, 1.39 and 54.5% when the evaporation, supply and return water temperature are -15, 55 and 35 degrees C, respectively. The COP of the proposed system has 13% and 20% improvement compared to those of the single-effect absorption system with and without waste heat recovery. Furthermore, the proposed system has energy saving potential of 11.7% and 39.6%, and payback time of 2.9 and 2.5 years compared to the single-effect absorption heat pump and the gas-fired boiler, respectively. The proposed system is suitable to provide 50 kW close range district heating for a typical urban residential building, especially in cold regions.

AB Energy is currently the basis for development in different areas worldwide. Traditional sources of energy such as coal, oil, and nuclear energy have serious repercussions on the environment and are non-renewable energies. Therefore, renewable energy, like solar, wind, and marine energy, are alternatives. Egypt is considered an important country that has climatic averages allowing the exploitation of renewable energy. Solar energy is available in Egypt, especially in Upper Egypt, throughout the year. Different models have been created to estimate and predict the global solar radiation intensity due to the shortage of measuring stations. This study presents a mathematical model to estimate and predict the global solar radiation intensity in Egypt. This model is compared and validated against published measurements of global solar radiation intensity. Furthermore, this study introduces a hybrid system used to produce hydrogen (photovoltaic generator-PEM electrolyzer). Modelling and simulating methods is done by running a flowchart in MATLAB to minimize the losses in the system and increase the quantity of hydrogen produced. The simulation includes the global solar radiation estimation and the photovoltaic generator-PEM electrolyzer. The experiment was conducted in March in Suez city, Egypt. The results obtained showed that the model of global solar radiation gives a good prediction for estimating the intensity of global solar radiation in Egypt. Furthermore, they concluded that there is a significant improvement in system performance that signifies an increase in the volume of hydrogen produced by the system. The whole model is simulated, and the simulation results fit the experimental data very well. The electrolyzer is powered by a PV panel and is modelled, sized, and experimentally validated.

AB The radial-inflow turbine is a key component of the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system, and its efficiency is related to working fluid properties and working conditions. In this paper, multi-objective algorithm was employed to conduct a comparative analysis of an ORC system with different turbine efficiency models (constant and variable). The system thermal efficiency and multi-objective optimization results between the constant turbine efficiency ORC system (CTORC) and the variable turbine efficiency ORC system (VTORC) were compared, and the reasons for the difference between the CTORC and VTORC system were analyzed. Sensitivity analysis was performed to compare the difference between the CTORC system and the VTORC system at different waste flue gas inlet temperature. The results show that the system thermal efficiency of both the CTORC and the VTORC increases with the increasing evaporation temperature and decreases with the increasing condensation temperature, while the variation rate of system thermal efficiency is different between CTORC system and VTORC system. The predicted turbine efficiency is significantly different for different working fluids and different working conditions. Considering the system comprehensive performance, R236ea is the optimal working fluid for the CTORC system, while R365mfc is for the VTORC system. For different working fluids, the error caused by using constant turbine efficiency model is different. With the increasing waste flue gas inlet temperature, the error caused by using constant turbine efficiency increases for R236ea, while the error caused by using constant turbine efficiency increases first and then decreases for R365mfc.

AB In this paper, a study of the energy performance of a solar powered vacuum membrane distillation was investigated on four typical days that represent the four seasons of the year namely: the equinoxes (March 21st and September 21st) and the solstices (June 21st and December 21st), through the widely used energy criteria such as specific energy consumption, gained output ratio and heat recovery factor. The results indicate that the energy performance of the process is strongly linked to the solar irradiation and as long as the VMD is coupled with solar energy, the process could be competitive with industrialized desalination technologies such as RO, MSF and MED. Besides, the effect of the applied vacuum level on the specific energy consumption was examined. Obviously, the results reveal that for minimum SEEC an optimal vacuum pressure is between 5000 and 10000 Pa. As well a technique to optimize the energy performance by recycling hot cooling water, used for steam condensation, was discussed. An amelioration of about 35%, 26% and 31%, during the hottest day (June 21st) and of about 22%, 19% and 21%, during the coldest (December 21st) in the GOR, the SEC and the daily production could be achieved.

AB The limited energy resources globally, low efficiency of renewable energies, complicated and costly energy conversion systems and environmental pollution have significantly increased scholar's interest in innovative and efficient systems and their improvement studies. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the efficiency of power generation systems used in geothermal sources of medium or low enthalpy. This study aims to improve the thermodynamic performance of an existing binary geothermal system with organic Rankine cycle and its system components while trying to comprehend the physical events/changes during these improvement processes. A model has been developed that simulates the system completely and accurately. Seventeen system parameters which were considered as crucial to maximize the exergy efficiency of the system like turbine inlet, condenser temperature and so on, are optimized using a gravitational search algorithm. The results of the study show that the exergy efficiency of the system is 14% and thus it can be maximized to 31% with optimization. During the optimization process, the pressure of work fluid on the evaporator line is increased and thus 2.1 MW more power is produced compared to normal power production. The condenser, with the highest exergy destruction in the system, has performance improvements of 75%. As a result, with the optimization process, a more compatible operating strategy between system components is ensured. This will allow the system and its components to run for longer and without failures.

AB The hysteresis of PEM fuel cell output voltage of the single cell and multi-cell stack is presented by experiments, during which the in-situ liquid water visualization at certain point of gas channel, quantitative measurement of the RH (relative humidity) and HFR (high frequency resistance) by EIS (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) were carried out. It is found that HFR makes little contribution to the hysteresis of voltage. Instead, the hysteresis of liquid water saturation s in GDL is believed to dominant this process. Although the hysteresis of capillary pressure of liquid water in GDL has already been the presented in previous works, it is for the first time that a simplified one-dimensional model on liquid water saturation is updated considering this effect to understand the possible relation between them. Two different liquid water saturation s distributions during imbibition and drainage are obtained by simulation and related hypothesis of different water morphology in GDL is proposed. Furthermore, according to the simulation results, the GDL consisting of material with high resistance to water penetrating is found to have the better performance in the flooding condition, but weak capability to maintain residual water during drainage of PEM fuel cell.

AB The stability problems of the hydroelectric generating unit caused by the vibration of the runner blades have been gradually exposed in the long-term operation, especially in the hydropower stations equipped with the bulb turbine. However, in the previous studies, the effects of the blades were not considered. Aiming at these problems, this research will be focused on studying the dynamic characteristics of the bulb hydroelectric generating unit in consideration with the effects of blades. Firstly, a novel continuum shaft system model of the bulb hydroelectric generating unit is originally established considering the effects of the blades. Meanwhile, the rationality of the novel model is verified by comparing with the field test data. Then, the dynamic evolutions of the shaft system with and without blades are contrastively analyzed and discussed with the changing of the runner mass eccentricity, the seal gap, the rotational speed and the exciting current. Fortunately, some critical values and stability evolution characteristics of the shaft system are obtained. In addition, the effects of the blades are also found. More importantly, these results could provide a reference for the safe operation of the hydropower stations.

AB Ambient vibrations resulted from mechanical motions and body movements are ubiquitous in daily life, which contain substantial amount of energy that can be converted into electricity by electromagnetic conversion. However, most existing electromagnetic energy harvesters utilize sliding or rotating magnets cutting the coil to produce electric current. Here an energy harvester using a rolling magnet is designed and fabricated, which can significantly increase the magnetic flux rate when cutting the coil compared to that using a sliding magnet. Importantly, a friction effect is introduced to improve the energy harvesting performance for this design, the output average power has been further increased by 50%. Experimental results show that under a walking speed of 4 km/h, an average power of 0.5 mW can be produced. While in the experiments of hand shaking with a frequency of 3.1 Hz, an average power of 1.02 mW can be captured. It is observed that the electric energy harvested from one-minute hand shaking is able to operate a sensor with 1.1 V working voltage for about two minutes. The conducted experiments of energy harvesting from walking/running, hand shaking and cycling demonstrate great potential of the developed harvester in building up self-powered wearable sensing systems.

AB This paper presents a theoretical and experimental analysis of the thermal runaway process of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) based on the internal combustion engines (ICEs) combustion theory. The experiments used 3.7 V, 31.6 Ah, lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide cells and an electronically pilot-ignited natural gas engine. The temperature characteristics between the ICE combustion process and the LIB thermal runaway process were analyzed and compared. The process evolution of the LIB failure process was summaried with the ICE working .process. One key evaluation parameters (T-sa) and its physical meanings of LIB thermal runaway characteristics was proposed. The reaction mode of the LIB thermal runaway process and its process divisions were analyzed based on the ICE combustion theory. In addition, the method of optimizating the LIB thermal runaway process was pointed out from the viewpoint of reaction mode. The results show that there exist high similarities between the temperature characteristics of the ICE combustion process and the LIB thermal runaway process. The temperatures of the above two processes first rise slowly, then rise sharply, and finally fall rapidly. The LIB failure process can be divided into four processes similar to those of the ICE working process: assemble, abuse, thermal runaway, and eruption. T-sa is the key parameter for early warning and evaluation of thermal runaway. The whole process is dominated by reactivity-controlled self-accelerated chemical reaction (RSCR) mode. The LIB RSCR can be characterized in terms of the induction period and duration, similar to the ICE combustion process. The duration is divided into the slow-reaction, fast-reaction and post-reaction periods. The reaction process is always accompanied by derivative processes, such as gassing, erupting and burning. Based on the ICE combustion theory, it can be concluded that the main reason for the un-controlled LIB thermal runaway process is that the internal cell boundaries are not controlled effectively.

AB In-situ transesterification is a one-step reaction to produce biodiesel directly from biomass feedstock. However, the effect of reaction parameters in in-situ transesterification on alkyl group distribution was indefinite, especially when it involved microalgae biomass. In fact, the alkyl group distribution is an important factor to determine the quality of biodiesel. In the present study, the effect of catalyst, methanol and moisture content on fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield and composition produced from the in-situ transesterification of Chlorella vulgaris was investigated. The maximum FAME yield attained was 94.6 wt% from the in-situ transesterification with H2SO4 (at 80.8 mol/mol of H+ to esterifiable lipid). Although the moisture content is a detrimental factor in producing FAME from microalgae biomass, high FAME yield ( > 90 wt%) could still be attained at the moisture content lesser than 15 wt%. Besides, the catalyst type and concentration had shown a stronger effect on alkyl group distribution as compared with methanol and moisture content, in which the low polyunsaturated and high saturated FAME compositions were attained at low catalyst concentration (for KOH and H2SO4) and high catalyst concentration (for KOH only), respectively. This could be attributed by the steric hindrance effect which was caused by the rotating flexibility of triglyceride alkyl groups during the in-situ transesterification and the rotating flexibility of FAME alkyl group during soap formation, respectively.

AB This research conducts a thermodynamic and transient analysis of the hybrid concentrated photovoltaic panel and vapour compression cycle thermal (CPV-VCC/T) system that is designed for combined heat and power purposes. The model includes both the VCC's thermodynamic model and the evaporator (CPV side) heat exchanger's convective heat transfer effect. Various commercial refrigerants (R123, R22, R245fa and R134a) are analyzed where their performances are assessed in terms of coefficient of performance (COP) and the CPV's resulting operating temperature. After the comparative steady state analysis, the CPV-VCC/T system is then tested in a two-day transient simulation involving varying irradiances and hot water demands. Steady state results demonstrate that the COP efficiency relative to Carnot will generally decrease as the condenser temperature increases. Also, although refrigerants R134a and R22 yielded up to 12% higher static COPs than R245fa and R123, the yielded electric energy gain from the two-day transient simulation is different by no more than 1.5%. Positively, the CPV-VCC/T system is found to yield 35% more electric energy than the conventional electric heating system. Although the CPV-VCC/T system yielded 5% less electric energy than direct water cooling, the CPV temperature was successfully maintained at 330 K as opposed to over 380 K.

AB This paper is dedicated to experimentally investigate the liquid galinstan based minichannel cooling for high heat flux and large heat power thermal management. Firstly, a compact electromagnetic pump towards effectively driving liquid metals was developed, which can provide high pressure head up to 100 kPa. Then, the minichannel heat sink was designed and manufactured, with width of channel 1 mm, height of channel 5 mm. Furthermore, the galinstan based minichannel cooling system was established and experimentally tested under different heating loads and pumping powers. The results show that galinstan based minichannel cooling system can dissipate heat with heat flux 300 W/cm(2) and heat power 1500 W. And the thermal performance and hydrodynamic characteristic of minichannel heat sink using galinstan as coolant were obtained. It indicates that compared to water based minichannel cooling, galinstan based minichannel cooling can obtain a rather larger heat transfer enhancement, and the pressure losses of galistan based minichannel heat sink is much lower than that of water based microchannel cooling. Moreover, it is also found that heat capacity thermal resistance becomes a rather important factor for the thermal performance of galinstan based minichannel, due to the high thermal conductivity and lower heat capacity of galinstan. Furthermore, the galinstan based minichannel cooling system can operate silently, steadily and smoothly by using electromagnetic pump, which has no moving parts. Overall, the galinstan based minichannel cooling is proven to be a powerful and practical way for the thermal management of high heat flux and large heat power devices.

AB In this paper a novel combined power and refrigeration cycle is proposed based on the ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) system, i.e. the Kalina cycle. In this combined cycle, solar energy is employed to raise the heat source temperature. Cooling capacity is generated concurrently by the ejector refrigeration cycle (ERC) which works on the exhaust heat extracted from the turbine in the Kalina cycle. Ammonia-water and isobutane are selected as the working fluid of Kalina cycle and ERC respectively. To evaluate the performance of the proposed cycle, the process is simulated in the commercial package ASPEN PLUS. It is found that, compared with the Kalina cycle, the proposed cycle has a higher primary energy ratio (PER) of 29.2% though it has a lower power output. Besides, the exergy efficiency and the primary energy saving ratio (PESR) in the proposed cycle reach as high as 41.88% and 8.3% respectively. It is also demonstrated that when the inlet pressure of the turbine exceeds 2.9 MPa and the outlet pressure of the turbine is between 1.3 and 1.6 MPa in the test range, the proposed cycle is better than the stand-alone systems from the energy saving perspective. Furthermore, parametric analysis shows that the inlet and outlet pressure of the turbine, the inlet temperature of the turbine, the basic concentration of ammonia-water, the generation pressure, ejector entrainment ratio and the outlet temperature of the condenser II have significant effects on the output of the turbine, refrigeration output, exergy efficiency, COP, PER as well as PESR.

AB The article presents a numerical investigation on turbulent thermal and fluid flow characteristics of multiple twisted tapes (MTTs) inserted sinusoidal rib tube (SRT) heat exchangers based on exhaust gas heat recovery background. The effects including geometric parameters of tape number (single, twin, triple and quadruple twisted tapes) and tape arrangements (clockwise and anticlockwise or co-swirl and counter-swirl) in the SRT were comparably studied. A periodic RNG k-epsilon numerical model was employed to depict the heat transfer behaviors and flow structures in the SRTs at a constant wall temperature condition. The results showed that the alone use of the SRT yielded enhanced heat transfer of about 27.4%-39.5% and increased friction loss of around 49.4%-74.7% higher than that in the baseline of spirally corrugated tube (SCT). In addition, it was found that the diverse thermo-hydraulic performances in the SRTs fitted with MTTs were dominated by flow structures of swirl flows and shear flows. By the synergy of longitudinal vortexes from SRT and MTTs, the Nusselt number and friction factor obtained from the SRTs fitted with MTTs were, respectively, larger than that from SCT at about 1.43-1.87 times and 2.66-10.07 times. In contrast to the SCT, the overall thermal performance evaluation criterion (PEC) was enhanced up to 1.59 for the alone use of SRT. Moreover, the PEC could be improved under increased heat transfer and reasonable pressure drop via suitable tape arrangements in the SRTs mounted with MTTs, of which the best PEC was 1.49. At last, the comparisons of present results with previous studies proved that the proposed enhanced devices held some competitive advantages.

AB In this paper, a new model of a combined heat and power system with hybrid prime mover including an internal combustion engine and an external combustion engine (Stirling engine) at different rotational speeds of the internal combustion engine is investigated. The recommended system can be used in building applications. Therefore, an internal combustion engine is used as the main prime mover of the system and for optimal using of the heating value of fuel, dissipated heat from its exhaust gas is used as the heat source of Stirling engine. Also, for estimating the performances of internal combustion and Stirling engines, a mathematical model called zero-dimensional single-zone and a numerical model called non-ideal adiabatic are used, respectively. Also, the combined production system has been modeled from viewpoints of thermal efficiency, overall efficiency, primary energy consumption, carbon dioxide emission and fuel consumption costs at different rotational speeds of the internal combustion engine and analyzed based on internal combustion engine (solely) and based on two engines (hybrid prime mover). Moreover, this system has been compared with a conventional energy production system for the building. Furthermore, a payback period in various working conditions for the system is calculated. Modeling results showed that using the hybrid prime mover led to a considerable increase in power output, thermal efficiency, and primary energy saving. Also, by using the hybrid system, the carbon dioxide emission and payback period had a dramatically reduction. In addition, for the combined production system with the internal combustion engine at rotational speed of 3500 rpm and operation of 9 h per day, the payback period was 10.5 years and for hybrid prime mover at this operation condition, it reduced to 7.5 years.

AB With the catalytic quality improvement of fatty acids, renewable alternative fuels can be produced from waste sources and contribute to sustainable mobility. The aim of this study was to investigate the blending of waste fatty acid in 10, 20, and 30 wt% into unrefined gas oils with different qualities during co-processing in a fixed bed pilot-scale reactor on a commercial, sulphided nickel-molybdenum-alumina catalyst. The effect of the feedstock's fatty acid content and the process parameters on the hydrocarbon composition, sulphur content, aromatic content, and the performance properties of the main products have been investigated. During the experiments, the process parameters were varied in different ranges, such as temperatures of 300-360 degrees C, hydrogen/hydrocarbon volume ratio of 600 N m(3)/m(3), pressure of 50 bar, and liquid hourly space velocity of 1.0-3.0 h(-1). From the results of these experiments, it was determined that fatty acids were completely converted. Under the selected favourable process parameters, which were 10 wt% fatty acid, 360 degrees C, and 1.0 h(-1), high-quality diesel fuel components with high hydrogen contents were produced. The excellent properties of the diesel fuel component, such as 4 mg/kg sulphur content, 1.3 wt% polycyclic aromatic content, and 13.7 wt% hydrogen content promoted cleaner combustion and reduced emissions. Therefore, the obtained renewable diesel fuel-blending component is more environmentally sustainable than conventional diesel fuels.

AB As there were limited efforts towards the substitution of diesel fuel with higher alcohols to operate diesel engine, the current work aims to evaluate diesel engine performance at wide operating conditions fuelled by blends of higher alcohols; including heptanol and octanol. To increase the trust of the received results, blends of lower alcohols (butanol) was studied where the attained results showed good agreement with those cited in the literature. Single-cylinder diesel engine setup equipped with the necessary sensors for measuring cylinder pressure, engine speed, output power, air flow rate, fuel flow rate and temperature at various locations in engine was used to realize the current objective. The study limits the blending ratios to be 10% and 20% v/v to keep the fuel system without any modifications. These blends showed stable and homogenous features for period of four months without phase separation. The steady state experiments were carried out at various engine loads (0%, 25%, 50% and 75% of the full load) and engine speeds (900 rpm and 1500 rpm). Results revealed that bsfc and BTE increased almost for all tested higher alcohol/diesel blends. The ignition delay increased with higher alcohols/diesel blends and the longest value was achieved by But10 and But20. The premixed combustion was enhanced for all tested higher alcohol/diesel blends. The highest cumulative net heat released was achieved for Hept20. The emissions of NOx and opacity were reduced while those of CO and HC emissions were increased for all tested higher alcohol/diesel blends compared to the corresponding values for D100.

AB Nowadays, gas turbines (GTs) are increasingly used in China, with a relatively low performance. Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is promising to recover the flue gas heat recovery from GT. To efficiently enhance the heat recovery, two-stage series evaporation is combined with non-isothermal phase change of non-azeotropic mixtures. Thus, two-stage series organic Rankine cycle (TSORC) with six non-azeotropic mixtures, composed of R245fa and hydrocarbons, as the working fluids are investigated. The cycle performances of TSORC with nonazeotropic mixtures are compared with those of the ORC with pure working fluid. Moreover, a case study was conducted to illustrate the performance enhancement by TSORC with the non-azeotropic mixture for fuel gas waste heat from C200HP. The results show that the net power output, thermal and exergy efficiencies of the TSORC are superior to those of the ORC at the same mass fraction, especially for the net power output. Comparing with the stand-alone gas turbine of C200HP, the TSORC with cyclohexane/R245fa[0.8/0.2] increases the efficiency of C200HP system by 35.48%, and the power generation efficiency of the C200HP-TSORC system achieves 44.71%. The TSORC with non-azeotropic mixtures as the working fluids is advisable and can be popularized in engineering applications.

AB Development of hybrid renewable energy system has become a challenging task considering the intermittencies of renewables and multi-dimensional designing aspects (for example technical and economic aspects) of such hybrid systems. Although there are many investigations on the development of hybrid renewable energy systems, the investigations of useful models or effective methods are only a few. Metaheuristic algorithms are gaining much popularity in the optimization of complex systems like hybrid renewable energy system for their ability to give quick, accurate, and optimal solution. The objective of the present study is to obtain a techno-economic optimal design of an off-grid hybrid solar photovoltaic/biogas generator/pumped hydro energy storage/battery system with the help of metaheuristic optimization techniques for a radio transmitter station in India. Performances of two such techniques - water cycle algorithm and moth-flame optimization that have become popular in recent time are evaluated and compared with Genetic Algorithm, which was used as a benchmark metaheuristic in prelious studies on hybrid renewable energy system. The objective function is a minimization of total net present cost subject to design constraints. A detailed modeling strategy has been elaborated for the optimization problem. A sensitivity analysis based on loss of load probability type reliability criteria is carried out to investigate the feasibility of the proposed design. The results show that both the considered metaheuristics are effective in finding the optimal design; however, water cycle algorithm has marginally better design solution than the other two algorithms. The optimal configuration by the water cycle algorithm is found to have solar photovoltaic panel area of 548.67 m(2) (size 69.2 kW), biogas generator size of 16 kW, battery bank of 21 units, converter size of 30 kW, and upper reservoir volume of 2081.5 m(3) with a total net present cost of $0.813 million. Further, on comparing the results with literature, it is found that the present metaheuristic optimization has resulted in an effective hybrid renewable energy system design with a lower techno-economic cost.

AB Electricity generation from renewable resources such as wind and solar energy inevitably involve intermittency due to the variable nature of wind speed and solar radiation. In this study, a mathematical model of a hydrogen-based self-sustaining integrated renewable electricity network (HySIREN) employing a supply-demand forecasting model and deep-learning (DL) algorithms is developed. The proposed model is implemented as follows: an empirical model decomposition is applied to decompose historical renewable electricity supply-demand data into a number of sub-layers; DL models are utilized to predict renewable electricity supply-demand patterns using the disclosed sub-layers; the predicted surplus renewable electricity and the predicted renewable electricity shortage are explicitly divided through a comparison of forecasting renewable electricity supply-demand data; and according to the results from forecasting models, a smart hydrogen balance is designed by an integrated hydrogen production process encompassing the steam methane reforming process and electrolyzers. Finally, a self-sustaining energy system is constructed and the system flexibility is enhanced, where the predicted surplus renewable electricity is used to convert produced and stored hydrogen into electricity to satisfy predicted renewable electricity shortages. The suggested model was validated by a case study of Jeju Island in the Republic of Korea and the feasibility of the HySIREN model was evaluated. Approximately 64.5% of the total environmental costs were eliminated. The results of this study suggest it would be beneficial to construct environmentally benign strategies for self-sustaining energy systems based on renewable resources.

AB Advanced sensor and communication technologies can make natural gas supply systems smarter than ever before, in both system management and operation. This paper presents the development of a novel data-driven Demand Side Management, whose framework includes demand forecasting, customer response analysis, prediction of dynamic condition of the gas network, quick supply reliability evaluation, multi-objective optimization and decision-making. The aims of this DSM method are to smooth load profiles, improve company profit and enhance system reliability, by means of a dynamic pricing strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the developed framework, a case study is considered, concerning the management of a relatively complex gas supply system, wherein four different pricing periods are introduced for comprehensively testing. The results in the case study show that the DSM framework is able to effectively achieve the targets of peak shaving and valley filling. Besides, it can significantly and stably improve the system efficiency and reliability, for different pricing periods. Finally, pricing period determination is discussed in relation to the features of performance.

AB Systems based on Organic Flash Cycle (OFC) are promising technologies for waste heat recovery application due to a better match of the hot and cold heat transfer curves. However, the large amount of exergy lost during the throttling process, results in a low thermal efficiency for OFC. In this work, ejectors are introduced in basic OFC to replace the low pressure throttle valve, high pressure throttle valve and both two throttle valves, which namely Single Ejector and Single Flash evaporator based OFC (SESF-OFC), Single Ejector and Double Flash evaporators based OFC (SEDF-OFC) and Double Ejectors and Double Flash evaporators based OFC (DEDF-OFC), respectively. The thermodynamic analysis including energy analysis, exergy analysis, the parametric analysis and comparison analysis are evaluated by using steady-state mathematical model and thermodynamic laws. The ejector allows a high pressure fluid to entrain and compress a low pressure fluid to a medium pressure. Hence, the mass flow rate or expansion ratio of turbine can be enhanced, results in all of three ejector based OFCs are more efficient than the basic OFC. When the high temperature fluid with temperature of 453.15 K is set as heat source, the maximum global second law efficiency (eta(II,G)) of 38.95% belongs to DEDF-OFC followed SEDF-OFC (37.92%), SESF-OFC (33.68%) and basic OFC (31.43%). The SEDF-OFC is more efficient than SESF-OFC, which indicates that the high pressure throttle valve replaced by ejector is a more effective method than the low pressure throttle valve done. Moreover, the four OFCs have been compared with conventional Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), and the comparison results show that the eta(II,G) of basic OFC and SESF-OFC are lower than that of ORC, while SEDF-OFC and DEDF-OFC are more efficient than ORC, and the average increment of SEDF-OFC and DEDF-OFC are 10.37% and 15.01%, respectively. Hence, the ejector based OFCs are alternative methods for waste heat recovery application with a high efficiency.

AB Although evaporative coolers consume much lower electricity than the vapor compression systems, they are not applicable in humid climates. Combination of desiccant wheels and evaporative coolers, known as desiccant-based evaporative cooling systems, allows evaporative coolers to be used in humid climates, which provide significant energy and environmental advantages with respect to vapor compression systems. However, one of the main disadvantages of evaporative cooling is the high water. Regarding the global water crisis, a cooling system which saves both water and energy will be an attractive alternative to the current cooling systems. To this aim, this paper presents a novel desiccant-based evaporative cooling system for co-production of water and cooling. In this system, the moisture content of exhaust regeneration air is recycled to cover all of the evaporative cooler water consumption, and also part of the domestic water usage. To evaluate the system performance, dynamic hourly simulation of the proposed system as well as a reference vapor compression system was performed for a typical 60 m(2) building in hot and humid climate of Bandar Abbas, Iran. The simulation results show that the proposed system is able to provide comfort temperature and relative humidity in a hot and humid climate. Moisture harvesting produce about 590 L water during a week, which covers all of the evaporative cooler water consumption, and provides an excess amount of 289 L for domestic usage. Monthly integrated results indicate that electricity consumption of the proposed system is 60% lower than the reference system, while its natural gas consumption is 30% higher than VCS, which is due to the high regeneration temperature in some hours. In other worlds, this system replace electricity consumption, a high-exergy and expensive energy carrier, with heat consumption. This system leads to 18.7% saving of CO2 emissions over a month. Economic evaluation proves the economic feasibility of proposed system with a payback period of 3 years. In conclusion, proposed system provide a more environmental friendly cooling system for water, energy and carbon saving.

AB This work firstly explores the feasibility of using a novel microwave-assisted, catalysed, hydrothermal process for the valorisation of brewers' spent grains (BSGs), examining the effects of the temperature (180-250 degrees C), pressure (50-130 bar), reaction time (0-2 h) and catalyst amount (Ni-Co/Al-Mg, 0-0.25 g cat/g biomass). This route turned out to be a very promising approach for the production of bio-fuels (bio-oil and bio-char) and platform chemicals (sugar rich aqueous solutions) in a single unit, helping the development of an innovative bio-refinery around BSGs. The overall conversion and the yields to gas, aqueous fraction and bio-oil varied by 31-68%, 10-33%, 9-48% and 4-14%, respectively. The bio-oil was made up a complex mixture of phenols (0-26%), ketones (0-80%), aldehydes (0-57%), carboxylic acids (0-18%) and nitrogen compounds (0-76%). The proportions of C, H, N and O in the bio-oil varied as follow: 15-61 wt%, 5-10 wt%, 1-6 wt% and 26-77 wt%, respectively, which shifted its higher heating value (HHV) between 9 and 27 MJ/kg. The liquid fraction comprised a mixture of DP > 6 oligosaccharides (67-98 C-wt.%), DP2-6 oligosaccharides (0-10 C-wt.%), saccharides (0.2-7 C-wt.%), carboxylic acids (0-7 C-wt.%) and furans (0-27 C-wt.%). The spent solid after the experiments resembled an energetic like bio-char product, whose proportions of C, H, O and N varied by 35-72 wt%, 4-8 wt%, 1-4 wt% and 18-57 wt% and its HHV shifted between 9 and 32 MJ/kg. The optimisation of the process revealed that using a temperature of 250 degrees C and a pressure of 125 bar for 2 h, it is possible to convert the original material into high-energy biofuels: (8%) bio-oil (26 MJ/kg) and (35%) bio-char (32 MJ/kg); together with a (31%) saccharide-rich (> 99 C-wt.%) aqueous solution, thus converting this process into a very promising approach to achieve an environmentally-friendly and integral valorisation of brewers' spent grains.

   STARCH
AB A sequential two-stage process comprising biological acidification followed by anaerobic digestion was proposed to enhance gaseous biofuel production from the mixture of rice residue and micro-algae after thermo-chemicial hydrolysis. The maximum specific hydrogen yield of 223.1 +/- 8.8 mL/g volatile solids (VS) and production rate of 10.4 +/- 0.4 mL/g VS/h were achieved from hydrothermal acid pre-treated biomass during biological acidification. Increase in hydraulic retention time of biological acidification from 12 to 144 h significantly affected the distribution of solubilised metabolic products and led to improved biological acidification rates (BARs) from 15.5% to 78.5%. Compared with single stage anaerobic digestion, the first stage acidification phase led to reductions in the lag-phase time and peak time of anaerobic digestion in such a two-stage process. The maximum specific methane production rate of 2.2 +/- 0.03 mL/g VS/h was achieved with a deep acidification of 144 h yielding a BAR of 78.5%. Increasing the length of time in biological acidification from 12 to 144 h contributed to improved energy conversion efficiency of 25.4%-64% after 120 h of anaerobic digestion. These results demonstrate that biological acidification is feasible to improve bioenergy recovery in two-stage fermentation.

AB This study of the thermodynamic performance of a transcritical CO2 ejector heat pump cycle presents a numerical analysis under the constraint of constant total heat transfer area. An experimentally validated model of a CO2 heat pump system and a model of a two-phase ejector are combined to perform the study. The effects of chosen parameters on system performance are investigated: operating conditions as determined by the gas cooler and evaporator pressures; ejector design parameters including the primary throat diameter, effective area ratio, and diffuser outlet diameter; system design as defined by the heat transfer area ratio. The results of this analysis allow specifying the optimal range for the design parameters in order to maximize the COP and the heating capacity of the heat pump. The heat transfer area ratio is shown to have important effects on the COP and heating capacity as well as the optimal gas cooler pressure. As the heat transfer area ratio increases, COP and heating capacity increase as well, while the optimum gas cooler pressure decreases. At given ejector geometries and operating conditions, this optimization can increase the COP and heating capacity of the ejector heat pump by approximately 17% and 20% respectively by increasing the heat transfer area ratio.

AB The Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell is a low-temperature electrochemical device that offers promising advantages such as higher efficiency compared to conventional power sources, possibly a green choice with avoiding air polluting problems. The mentioned advantages will be obtained once the Fuel Cell is accurately and efficiently controlled. Experimentally, there are two significant problems in efficiently controlling of the Fuel Cell voltage including high-speed voltage oscillations and low-speed dynamic response. As well, the co-evolution ribonucleic acid genetic algorithm is presented as a novel algorithm to obtain the optimal control parameters. This algorithm is motivated from the biological Ribonucleic Acid and encodes the chromosomes by Ribonucleic Acid nucleotide basics and accepts some Ribonucleic Acid operations. Present work adopted some genetic operators to preserve the diversity of individuals, and individuals are separated into two sets. Different evolutionary methods are considered for these two sub-populations for compromising between exploration and explanation. Primarily, a comprehensive model of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell is presented. For presenting a simple application and reliable industrial control system, this paper showed a lead-lag controller. Firstly, this control system is adjusted to a certain operational point. Despite to reveal appropriate information considering the present condition of the plant, its efficiency will be decreased by varying the situations. So, the next step is employing the proposed co-evolutionary ribonucleic acid genetic algorithm for obtaining optimum values for controller parameters versus the varying conditions as well as fault occurrences. Finally, the obtained results are presented for efficiency validation of suggested control system, and these obtained results are analyzed.

AB An experimental investigation of the steam methane reforming process in a cylindrical packed bed filled with the Ni-alpha Al2O3 catalysts was performed to understand the effect of particle shapes of catalyst on a pressure drop and a methane conversion. Four particle shapes such as a simple cylinder, a Raschig ring, a 7-holes cylinder, and a 7-holes sphere were tested. Moreover, the simple cylinders and the Raschig rings were tested for various end-to-end dimensions (5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm, 20 mm, 25 mm). The present study showed that the methane conversion is increasing with an increase in the geometric surface of the packed at a constant packed bed length (600 mm). Two quantities are proposed for evaluating the effectiveness of the packed beds filled with a catalyst of various shape: a weight residence time (kg(cat).s/mol) and a surface residence time (m(2).s/mol). The maximum methane conversion is observed for the 7-holes spheres. The catalytic activity of the surface unit of all investigated catalyst shapes is approximately the same. A characteristic quadratic dependence of a pressure drop versus velocity Delta P = f (u(2)) is observed for all catalyst types. The minimum pressure drops are taking place in a packed bed filled with the 7-holes cylinders, while the maximum pressure drops are occurring for the simple cylinders. The linear (1/mm) and volumetric (1/m(3)) drag coefficient were calculated. The drag coefficient is decreasing when the velocity decreases, especially in the velocity range up to 1 m/s.

AB In this work, the MgO-CO2 working pair has been adapted for thermochemical energy storage (TCES) at medium temperatures by the MgO modification with inorganic salts to promote the TCES dynamics. Brief screening of modifying salts showed that lithium acetate (LiOAc) and mixed lithium-potassium nitrate (Li0.42K0.58NO3) additives could considerably promote the MgO carbonation at P(CO2) <= 10 bar and T >= 300 degrees C. The de- and re-carbonation kinetics, as well as cycling stability of the doped MgO/MgCO3, was reported to outline possible TCES operating conditions (T = 280 degrees C-380 degrees C, P(CO2) = 0-1 bar). The heat storage capacity of the salt-promoted MgO was estimated to be 1.6 GJ/m(3). A concept of chemical heat pump utilizing the MgO-CO2 working pair was discussed. The salt-promoted MgO-CO2 working pair was concluded to be promising for TCES.

AB Actuator disc models are frequently used to provide a semi-analytical approach to estimating aerodynamic loads on rotary blades. The basic idea is to distribute the aerodynamic loads on a virtual rotating disc instead of simulating the actual rotating blade. These loads are then imposed to represent the source terms of the Navier-Stokes equations, which can be solved numerically using the computational fluid dynamic methods. The thickness of the actuator disk grid is one important factor considerably affecting calculations of the wind turbine rotor. Past researches generally considered the idea of fixed grid thickness exerting along the blade in their actuator disk modeling. However, this study introduces an innovative or improved actuator disk model, which takes into account the real blade thickness of a wind turbine in the computational fluid dynamic simulations. This novel actuator disk model is then incorporated into a finite-volume solver. This solver uses the second-order central and upwind schemes to approximate the diffusive and advective fluxes at the cell faces, respectively. The k-s turbulence model is used to close the turbulence closure problem. The NREL 5-MW wind turbine blade is chosen as a benchmark test to evaluate the results of the newly developed solver for the numerical predictions of the wind turbine rotor. The current study reveals that there is a specific fixed grid thickness value resulting in the most accurate predictions though with a much slower convergence rate. This specific value really depends on the chosen test cases and varies from one case to another. Its exact value may be found via try-and-error procedures, which would be computationally very expensive and time-consuming. Alternatively, this study introduces an improved actuator disk model capable of reinstating the real blade thickness in calculations. Subsequently, the wind turbine rotor performance is predicted numerically using both the improved and classic actuator disk models applying various fixed grid thickness values along the blade. The results demonstrate that the accuracy of the classic actuator disk model strongly depends on the grid thickness magnitude. On the contrary, the newly improved actuator disk model results in some solutions, which are as accurate as those of the most accurate classic actuator disk model, while suitably speeding up the convergence rate.

AB Water and thermal management is of great importance to proton exchange membrane fuel cell. A comfort index is proposed to comprehensively evaluate the water and thermal characteristics in proton exchange membrane fuel cell. It refers to the concept of comfort index in meteorology and selects the cathode liquid water accumulation and anode membrane drying as two basic factors so as to prevent water flooding and low proton conductivity simultaneously. The anode and cathode comfort degrees corresponding to the anode membrane drying and cathode liquid water accumulation, respectively, are quantified and fitted at various operation conditions, of which the parameters in the calculation process are determined utilizing a carefully validated quasi-two-dimensional model. The influences of cathode stoichiometric ratio, operating pressure, coolant temperature difference, cathode relative humidity, coolant temperature, anode recirculating ratio, current density and membrane thickness at wide-range temperature are studied in detail by the comfort index. It is found that the comfort index usually first increases and then decreases with the increment of temperature, because the low water saturation pressure at low temperature makes the water condensation easier and thus leads to water flooding. Compared to analytical simulation models, the comfort index is able to instantly obtain the quantified water and thermal characteristics in proton exchange membrane fuel cell, which is of great significance to the stack design and in-situ system controlling in practical design.

AB The declaration of 2016, third year in a row, as the warmest year ever recorded, the rising of CO2 concentration, increasing of seawater acidity as well as sea surface temperature are among the worst scenarios of global warming. One of the ways to reduce the harmful emissions is to use renewable energy sources. Biodiesel, being one of the less environment-damaging options to fuel diesel engines, is making its way globally as a greener portion of diesel engines emissions. For countries where utilization of high technological energy sources is a real challenge, then vegetable oils and waste oils from local sources are the possible option. This greener fuel has been mandated of its usage in many countries across the continents in a blending range up to 20% with petro-diesel. The concept of biorefinery is a must as to make the biodiesel industry viable, and to gauge its practicability, Biorefinery Complexity Index (BCI) is a way to go. Production and the use of biodiesel are not without challenges; challenges in term of cost, cold performance, storage stability, engine warranty, post production issues, boundary setting in life cycle analysis and public perceptions. Without an overall assessment, the benefits of biodiesel are not guaranteed; as such, this review is aimed to discuss those challenges, in addition providing possible options as to make this greener fuel into reality in much wider scope.

AB In this paper, nine new diffuse fraction and eight new diffuse coefficient models were developed by introducing precipitation as one of the model parameters. Concurrently, thirty-four existing diffuse fraction and eleven existing diffuse coefficient models were reviewed. The existing and proposed models were compared to assess their applicability in different climate zones in China. According to the best models and climate zones, general models were established. Overall, introducing precipitation could effectively improving the underestimation problems of daily diffuse solar radiation; for diffuse fraction models, precipitation had stronger correlation with diffuse radiation than relative humidity in humid areas and weaker correlation in arid areas. For diffuse coefficient models, the models incorporating precipitation could obtain better accuracy than temperature and relative humidity in all climate zones under similar meteorological parameters. Therefore, precipitation should be preferentially adopted, followed by temperature and relative humidity. The general models developed in this paper performed well in estimating the daily diffuse solar radiation. The average coefficient of determination, root mean square error and mean absolute bias error of diffuse fraction general models were 0.82, 1.44 MJm(-2)d(-1) and 1.04 MJm d(-1), respectively; while the corresponding values of diffuse coefficient general models were 0.69, 1.98 MJm(-2)d(-1) and 1.54 MJm(-2)d(-1), respectively. The general models could represent the daily diffuse solar radiation estimation of stations without diffuse solar radiation records.

AB Developing successful fuel cell hybrid vehicles (FCHVs), to be destined to the widest deployment within the entire transport sector, is nowadays considered as a highly strategic target to fully meet well known environmental and regulatory constraints at international level. This happens thanks to the intrinsic overall superior features of fuel cell propulsion when compared to both electric and hybrid vehicles, such as high fuel-economy, reduced tank-to-wheel environmental impact and good ranges. Successful achievement of the above-introduced challenging goal motivates the research activity presented and discussed in this paper, namely the development of an advanced mathematical tool featuring co-optimization capabilities. The reason for such a requirement lies in the well-known strong interactions and mutual influence between selected design criteria and adopted control strategies. Therefore, a comprehensive model of a generic FCHV architecture and a specification independent control strategy, thus adaptable to different fuel cell system and battery sizes, were preliminary developed. Then, they were integrated and embedded within a modular constrained optimization algorithm, which was conceived in such a way as to simultaneously find the optimal FCHV powertrain design, as well as real-time applicable control strategies. Suitable design and energy management criteria were investigated on a selected driving cycle, in such a way to explore several powertrain configurations (i.e. more hybrid, as well as more plugin and range-extender like FCHV). This allowed verifying the suitability of the proposed procedure to yield solutions ensuring low hydrogen consumption (i.e. fuel economy as high as 135 km/kg) and full alignment with targeted energy management policies. Discussion of results, together with the physical meaning of main design and control variables provided as outcomes, underline the effectiveness of the proposed tool in providing a solid support in the preliminary design of cost-effective fuel cell powertrain destined to a variety of applications and driving habits.

AB Long time series of wind data can have data gaps that may lead to errors in the subsequent analyses of the time series. This study proposes using the wavelet transform as a system to verify that a data completion technique is correct and that the data series behaves correctly, enabling the user to infer the expected results. Wind speed data from three weather stations located in southern Europe were used to test the proposed method. The series consist of data measured every 10 min for 11 years. Various techniques are used to complete the data of one of the series; the wavelet transform is used as the control method, and its scalogram is used to visualize it. If the representation in the scalogram has zero magnitude, it shows the absence of data, so that if the data are properly filled in, then they have similar magnitudes to the rest of the series. The proposed method has shown that in case of data series inconsistencies, the wavelet transform can identify the lack of accuracy of the natural periodicity of these data. This result can be visually checked using the WT's scalogram. Additionally, the scalograms provide valuable information on the variables studied, e.g. periods of higher wind speed. In summary, the wavelet transform has proven to be an excellent analysis tool that reveals the seasonal pattern of wind speed in periodograms at various scales.

AB Practitioners take more interest in the output conditions of cooling systems than the details of the processes. In this study, regression models are developed that relate input parameters, including operational and geometrical parameters, to selected output responses of counter flow dew point evaporative cooling systems using numerical simulations and response surface methodology. The considered input operational parameters are inlet air temperature, inlet air relative humidity, inlet air velocity, and extraction ratio. The considered geometrical parameters are the channel length and channel width of the cooling system. The selected output responses are outlet air temperature, outlet air relative humidity, and wet-bulb effectiveness. The regression models are developed using a numerical model that is validated using experimental measurements. The predicted outlet temperatures of the counter flow dew point evaporative cooling system using the regression model match the numerical model predictions and experimental measurements within +/- 4% and +/- 10%, respectively. Therefore, the developed regression models provide a simple mean to predict the performance, aid in the design and optimization of counter flow dew point evaporative cooling systems.

AB Although the Peltier sub-cooled trans-critical CO2 cycle concept has been applied for refrigeration, which typically involves discharging the heat into ambient air, this system is rarely considered for heat pumping purposes. Therefore, this research aims to expand the scope of the Peltier sub-cooled trans-critical CO2 cycle into heat pump water heating where the generated heat is uniquely discharged into water at temperatures progressively higher than ambient. The heat flows between the CO2 and flowing water are modelled as Nusselt based convective heat transfers where a 1D model is imposed to the direct gas cooler to improve simulation accuracy. Moreover, important but often neglected characteristics such as Peltier device size and Peltier heating factor (PHF) will also be analyzed. Results indicate that the PHF has an extremely strong influence on the overall system's coefficient of performance (COP). Specifically, an optimal PHF value exists as a trade-off between the benefit of sub-cooling and the losses due to reduced CO2 mass flow rate, the latter of which caused reductions in the convective heat transfer coefficient and the direct gas cooler's heating capacity. In the meantime, although larger Peltier device sizes improves the system COP, the improvement will converge towards a specific maximum.

AB In this study, the effects of induction conditions on the distribution characteristics of graded bio-oil derived from the co-pyrolysis of bio-oil distillation residue and bituminous coal were investigated in a fixed pyrolysis reactor with a three-stage condenser. Based on the central composite design and statistical analysis, it could be found that a quadratic model was recommended to depict the total bio-oil yield, whereas the linear model was the best-fitting model for the graded bio-oil yield of different condensation stages. As for total bio-oil yield, all the combined effects of induction conditions played a negative role, and all second-order effects were advantageous. Moreover, the high percentage of distillation residue contributed to the bio-oil yield at each condenser and had the greatest impact on the bio-oil yield of the first condenser. However, high temperatures and high gas flow rates reduced the bio-oil yield of the first condenser and favored the increase in bio-oil yield of subsequent condensers. In addition, the products derived from distillation residue were more abundant than bituminous coal. And the addition of bituminous coal did not significantly increase the type of compounds in bio-oil from the blends, but disturbed the distribution of bio-oil products. The condensers with different temperatures facilitated the separation and enrichment of different compounds.

AB As the most suitable thermal energy storage manner for the Joule-Brayton based Pumped Thermal Electricity Storage (PTES), packed beds thermal energy storage has the natural feature that a steep thermal front propagates with great difference of temperature and density, which lead to an unbalanced mass flow rate of packed bed reservoirs and the PTES close loop. In this paper, the expression of thermal front propagation and unbalanced mass flow rates between the inflow and the outflow of packed beds is developed and validated experimentally. The result indicates that there are 0.62%, 0.26% and 0.36% unbalanced mass flow for the hot reservoir, the cold reservoir and the PTES close loop respectively. The sensitivities of the factors such as pressure ratio, heat capacity of TES material and porosity on the unbalanced mass flow rate and the round-trip efficiency of PTES system considering mass flow rate is discussed. Furthermore, a feasible and self-balancing PTES system without buffer vessel is proposed, with a round-trip efficiency 0.12% higher than the buffer vessel balancing PTES system.

AB The current research deals with the thermodynamic and economic assessments of an integrated thermoelectric generator system with the liquefied natural gas production process. The main aim of the present work is investigation the influence of the thermoelectric generators modules location, in a liquefied natural gas production cycle, on the thermodynamic and economic criteria. A Matlab code has been developed to assess the integrated system performance. Suggested integrated systems include adding the thermoelectric generators between the condensers and evaporators (Case I) and adding the thermoelectric generators between the condensers and ambient air (Case II). The results show that the position of the thermoelectric generators considerably influences the system performance. The results indicates that in Case I (with adding thermoelectric generators between condenser and evaporator) the system performance deteriorate drastically.
   The results for Case II exhibit that the coefficient of performance increases with an increase in x value. Moreover, economic analysis of employment of thermoelectric generators in liquefaction cycle indicates that with thermoelectric generator cost of 1 $/W the payback rate of investment is less than 2 years (1.29 years).

AB Internal heterogeneity is a significant challenge to the service life of large-format commercial fuel cell stacks. Methods for diagnosing fuel cell stack health, however, are still lacking. This paper proposes a novel diagnostic methodology for analyzing the performance, the consistency between cells and the uniformity within individual cells of fuel cell stacks. Specifically, this three-step methodology can comprehensively analyze the internal heterogeneity of large-format multi-cell stacks. First, a polarization curve test is conducted to provide a quick qualitative performance analysis. Then, the quantitative parameters consistency decline is analyzed by galvanostatic charging and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy methods. Finally, a novel multi-point voltage monitoring method is applied to rule out possible misdiagnoses and to qualitatively analyze cell uniformity. This degradation diagnostic methodology is applied to analyze degradation in several fuel cell stacks, revealing high potential in practice.

AB Challenges arising from the transition to a more sustainable energy system require increased flexibility on demand and supply side. In energy-intensive industry optimal operation of energy supply systems and energy consumption from the electric grid is a promising contribution to flexibility enhancement. An industrial plant model derived from characteristics in pulp and paper industry was therefore implemented. A mixed-integer linear program was formulated to determine cost optimal operation of supply, conversion and thermal storage units for different electricity prices and carbon dioxide emission certificate costs at the level of year 2017 and of forecasts for year 2019. Furthermore, the capacity of the thermal storage was varied and cost savings could be obtained for increased storage capacities. Operation costs decreased around 5% for a storage capacity accounting for 7% of the total live steam conversion capacity. A further rise of 7% only accounted for another cost decrease of approximately 1%. Double emission certificate costs compared to 2018 had only a minor impact on the operation of the industrial test plant, but an average rise in costs of 5%. Furthermore, interaction of electricity demand, the thermal storage capacity and optimal operation could be reported.

AB Solid oxide cell systems (SOCs) are increasingly being considered for electrical energy storage and as a means to boost the use of renewable energy and improve the grid flexibility by power-to-gas electrochemical conversion. The control of several variables (e.g., local temperature gradients and reactant utilization) is crucial when the stacks are used in dynamic operation with intermittent electrical power sources. In the present work, two 1D models of SOC stacks are established and used to investigate their dynamic behavior and to select and tune a suitable control strategy. Subsequently, safe operating ranges were determined to meet the thermal constraints of the stack by analysing not only the fuel cell (SOFC) and electrolyzer (SOEC) individual modes but also the switching between the two modes when the stack operates reversibly. The dynamic analysis shows that the control loops of our multi-input (reactant molar flow rates), multi-output (reactant utilization and maximum local temperature gradients) control system are strongly decoupled. Therefore, a proportional integral control strategy can be used to prevent dangerous stack operating conditions in dynamic operation. Finally, the controllers were tuned, and their transfer functions were reported. Convective heat transfer via air flow allows controlling the temperature of the solid structure of the cell/stack component, thus avoiding issues related to temperature variation during transient operation. Moreover, the reactant utilization controllers can avoid component fracture or degradation owing to fuel starvation under dynamic operation. The process can be approximated by two first order transfer functions. It can help in the design of more complex control systems in the future if necessary, with embedded process models, such as model predictive control. Results in the simulation environment are preparatory to the programming phase of an actual controller in real-world applications.

AB This study attempts to answer two questions by developing a thermodynamic mathematical model: which is the optimal energy conversion process, generating power and desalting water independently or coupling power generation with seawater desalination technologies via cogeneration power and desalting plants (CPDP)? How would modifying the plant design affect the performance of a CPDP? Nine different configurations of power and water conversion technologies are modeled and compared with respect to an ideal reversible CPDP using a newly introduced cost-based dimensionless parameter, the power and water gain ratio (PWGR). Results of this study show that producing power using a gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC) and desalting seawater using reverse osmosis (RO) on a stand-alone basis is the most energy efficient for generating power and desalinating water simultaneously. GTCC-RO has the closest PWGR set at 1.470 to the ideal reversible reference plant's 1.529 PWGR. Modifying the number of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST), and multi-effect distillation (MED) units can improve the performance of the combined cycle heat and power (CCHP) reference plant coupled with MED desalination units.

AB Absorption chiller systems are advantageous to vapor compression cooling systems due to capability of utilizing low-grade heat sources such as waste heat from industries, renewable energies, and generated heat by fuel cell. The main issue in absorption cooling system is the low cycle coefficient of performance (COP) that can be addressed by integrated ejector-absorption cooling systems. In this study, an integrated system of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell that thermally drives an ejector-absorption refrigeration cycle is proposed. The effects of generator temperature, condenser pressure, evaporator pressure, and inlet fuel mass flow rate to the fuel cell on the ejector entrainment ratio (phi) and COP are evaluated. Moreover, the performance of the integrated system is evaluated at different geometrical and operating conditions of PEM fuel cell. The results reveal that the phi and COP parameters increase up to 18.51% and 48% by increasing the generator temperature from 70 degrees C to 100 degrees C, respectively. At higher inlet mass flow rate of fuel to the reformer, the cooling capacity and the system COP improve. Furthermore, the maximum value of phi and COP are 0.39 and 0.77, respectively, at the best operating condition of the PEM fuel cell, i.e. the current density of 0.75 A/cm(2). It is also concluded that the system overall energy efficiency at temperature of 80 degrees C and the current density of 0.5, 0.6, 0.75, and 0.85 A/cm(2) are 43%, 39%, 35%, 32%, and 37%, respectively. Moreover, the COP of absorption chiller with ejector at the operating pressure of 1 bar and the temperature of 80 degrees C for PEM fuel cell is 6.7% higher than conventional absorption chiller.

AB Gas-phase solar receivers use atmospheric or pressurised gas as their heat transfer fluid (HTF). The ideal gas phase receiver would provide high thermal efficiency and high HTF outlet temperature with low pressure drop and low capital cost. In practice, these four objectives are hard to achieve simultaneously since it is difficult to (cost-effectively) overcome the intrinsically poor heat transfer performance between the solid absorber and the gaseous HTF. Thus, this review provides an in-depth look at the recent progress towards solving this challenge of pressurised gas-phase receivers to identify the remaining knowledge/research gaps. In general, gas-phase receivers can be classified as direct or indirect solar absorbers and by the type of heat transfer enhancement (HTE) employed to address the poor absorber-to-HTF heat transfer rate. The present review suggests the receiver designs that show the most promise for further improvement from each of the active, passive and compound HTE methods. This study also finds that there is a need for more proof-of-concept tests for these receiver designs, since the number of studies which include real prototypes operating under real weather conditions is limited. Based on a review of successful prototyping research, this review suggests proper prototyping procedures for high-temperature receivers. Overall, the authors believe the present study presents an up-to-date, comprehensive review of the progress on gas-phase receivers, along with some meaningful, specific guidance on the necessary next steps in their development. This is significant because gas-phase receivers represent the best near-term solution for pushing solar systems to higher temperatures, enabling integration with advanced/combined cycles and solar thermochemical reactors with endothermic chemical reactions at high temperature (e.g. mineral processes and solar fuels).

AB To explore the influence of fuel injection strategy on the combustion process, the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed, and simulation results were validated against the experimental data measured at different rail pressures and injection timings. The experiments were conducted on a diesel engine equipped with an advanced injection system that allows full control over the injection parameters. To model the combustion process of EN590 diesel fuel, two different approaches were used: the General Gas Phase Reactions (GGPR) approach and the 3-zones Extended Coherent Flame Model (ECFM-3Z +). The calculated results, such as mean pressure and rate of heat release, were validated against experimental data in operating points with different injection parameters in order to prove the validity of spray and combustion sub-models. At the higher injected pressure, GGPR model showed better prediction capability in the premixed phase of combustion process, compared to the ECFM-3Z + model. Nevertheless, in the rate-controlled phase of combustion process, ECFM-3Z + model shows stronger diffusion of temperature field, due to the more detailed consideration of combustion diffusion phenomena in the ECFM-3Z + governing equations. Furthermore, the results show that the rail pressure has a lower impact on the combustion process for injection timing after the Top Dead Centre (TDC). Both, single and multi-injection cases are found to be in a good agreement with the experimental data, while the GGPR approach was found to be suitable only for combustion delay determination and ECFM-3Z + also for the entire combustion process.

AB The transcritical carbon dioxide vapor compression cycle is commonly used for heating and cooling applications because of the high discharge temperature and large evaporation heat. Whereas, high return water temperature is usually required by the heating demands, which significantly degrades the system performances. Nowadays, various kinds of subcooling methods have been proposed for the transcritical carbon dioxide vapor compression cycle, but a systematic comparative study based on the trade-off between the thermodynamic efficiency and economic cost is needed to analyze the applicability of these methods for large-scale district heating and cooling applications. In this work, the hot water temperature increases from 323.15 K to 343.15 K for district heating, and chilled water temperature reduces from 285.15 K to 280.15 K for district cooling. The simple single-stage transcritical carbon dioxide vapor compression cycles using subcooling methods with and without expansion work recovery, including internal heat exchanger, dedicated mechanical subcooling, cooling tower and dry cooler, are respectively modeled from the energetic, exergetic and economic perspectives. Based on the dual-objective Jaya algorithm and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution decision-making method, the parametric study is conducted with optimized system performances to analyze the effects of different ambient conditions, namely the winter mode with ambient temperature from 248.15 K to 278.15 K and the summer mode with ambient temperature from 288.15 K to 318.15 K, and the relative humidity from 30% to 90%. Afterwards, the optimal subcooling methods under different ambient temperatures are selected based on the overall optimization and comparative study. The effects of different ambient temperatures on the system performances vary with different subcooling methods without expansion work recovery, and the dry cooler is the optimal subcooling method at the ambient temperatures from 248.15 K to 268.15 K, while the cooling tower is suggested under ambient temperatures higher than 278.15 K in spite of the performance degradation with high relative humidity. Insignificant differences of system performances using different subcooling methods can be observed with expansion work recovery, and the internal heat exchanger is selected as the optimal subcooling method for winter-mode operations, while the cooling tower is also suggested as the suitable subcooling method in the summer mode.

AB Short-term wind speed prediction is an important task for the wind energy development. However, due to intermittency and uncertainty of wind resources, it is difficult to be achieved only by the deterministic prediction. Hence, there is a motivation to develop a novel method to further consider the uncertainty. The originality is to develop an innovative hybrid wind speed forecasting model based on empirical mode decomposition, variational mode decomposition, sample entropy and conditional kernel density estimation. More specifically, the original data are decomposed in real time by the refined variational mode decomposition, where the number of decomposition levels is adaptively determined by empirical mode decomposition and sample entropy. Then, conditional kernel density estimation with the bandwidth optimized by normal reference criterion is used to obtain the predictive probability density function for each subseries, by which the expectations and variances are derived. Finally, the deterministic prediction is produced by summarizing these expectations and the probabilistic prediction interval is obtained by the covariance and the Gaussian distribution assumption on target wind speed. It should be emphasized that some hypotheses are adopted in the proposed method: the correlations among different subseries can be characterized by the covariance and the target wind speed follows Gaussian distribution. Two case studies based on the measured data are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results show the improvement by the proposed method is up to 20% compared with empirical mode decomposition-based method. The main conclusion is that the proposed method may provide the better prediction over other models for the wind speed data with nonstationarity.

AB Chemical looping gasification (CLG) of lignite by using hematite oxygen carrier is performed to achieve high purity synthesis gas. The oxygen carrier reaction performance as well as the effects of temperature and lignite/ oxygen carrier ratio on the syngas evaluation are investigated by TG and fixed bed reactor coupling with various analytical methods. The experimental results reveal that the hematite oxygen carrier consisting primarily of Fe2O3, SiO2 and Al2O3 presents three H-2 reduced peaks at 472.59 degrees C, 634.17 degrees C and 849.01 degrees C respectively, corresponding to the crystal form transition from Fe2O3 to Fe. Lignite pyrolyzes preferentially to generate intermediates then further reacts with oxygen carrier to produce synthesis gas in CLG process, following the oxygen carrier reaction path of Fe2O3 -> Fe0.963O -> Fe2O3. Oxygen carrier plays a key role in promoting lignite conversion to synthesis gas in CLG process owing to the lattice oxygen shifting reactions equilibrium to the direction of syngas production. Excessive lattice oxygen is beneficial to CLG reaction until the L/O ratio reaches to 4/6 with the limitation of heat and mass transfer in reaction system. However, the minimum value of O/L is 2/8, which ensures the oxygen carrier makes obvious promotion effect in reaction process. High temperature improves synthesis gas yield and carbon conversion by enhancing endothermic reactions in CLG process. The hematite oxygen carrier recovers main crystalline phase after the CLG process without serious sintering.

AB The accurate forecasting of wind speed plays a vital role in the transformation of wind energy and the dispatching of electricity. However, the inherent intermittence of wind makes it a challenge to achieve high-precision wind speed forecasting. Many existing studies consider the spatio-temporal correlation of wind speed but ignore the influence of meteorological factors on wind speed with changes in time and space. Therefore, to obtain a reliable and accurate forecasting result, a novel multifactor spatio-temporal correlation model for wind speed forecasting is proposed in this study by combining a convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory neural network. The convolutional neural network is used to extract the spatial feature relationship between the meteorological factors at various sites. The long short-term memory neural network is used to extract the temporal feature relationship between the historical time points. Meanwhile, a new data reconstruction method based on a three-dimensional matrix is developed to represent the proposed multifactor spatio-temporal correlation model. Finally, the datasets collected from the National Wind Institute in Texas, 14 baseline models, 8 evaluation metrics, a performance improvement percentage, and hypothesis testing are used to evaluate the proposed model and provide further discussion comprehensively and scientifically. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other baseline models in the accuracy of forecasting and the generalization ability.

AB This study experimentally investigates the effectiveness of various PV cleaning techniques for potential retrofitting into unmanned aerial vehicles, drones, for large-scale solar power plant cleaning operations in desert climates. The ultimate objective of this study is to improve the efficiency, reduce the cost, time and environmental impact of cleaning techniques by integrating them with autonomous drone cleaning to ensure cost-effectiveness and competitiveness of Solar PV installations. This study considers the following factors: (i) cleaning effectiveness (power output change in W and %), (ii) frequency of cleaning (daily, weekly, and monthly), (iii) overall cost of cleaning (USD/m(2)), (iv) adaptability to drone, (v) energy consumption, and (vi) weight. The cleaning techniques tested for their effectiveness and overall cost are (1) cloth wipers, (2) brushes, (3) vacuum cleaners, and (4) some combinations. Cleaning frequency is varied from 1-day to 1-month intervals to find the optimal cleaning period. The results of this study show that there is a significant reduction in the PV efficiency, and hence an increase in the cost of produced electricity, for monthly cleaning periods regardless of cleaning technique in desert climate conditions. The microfiber based-cloth wiper is found to be the optimum method from both cost and performance point of view. Microfiber based-cloth wiper achieved on average 7.7% and 3.1% performance improvement (compared to control panel) for weekly cleaning frequency in winter and summer seasons, respectively. The assessment of drone retrofitting was also conducted, which resulted that the brush and microfiber based-cloth wiper with their low weight, small size, and ease of use are best-suited options for drone-based solar panel cleaning. The evaluation factors for microfiber based-cloth wiper are found to be (i) 3.1% for cleaning effectiveness in summer, (ii) 1 week for frequency of cleaning, (iii) 0.41 USD/m(2) for overall cost of cleaning, (iv) 9.5 (out of 10) for adaptability to drone, (v) 10 (out of 10) for energy consumption and (vi) 9 (out of 10) for weight.

AB Biogas for supply of power plants can play a paramount role in reducing greenhouse gas emission and extra cost of a fossil fuel based plants. Regarding this aspect of biogas heat source, a novel biogas-based multigeneration system is proposed and modeled under privilege of first and second laws of thermodynamics, economic, and environmental perspectives. Furthermore, multi-criteria optimization of this integrated system is carried out from 4E (energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, and environmental) analysis standpoints. The introduced multigeneration system is able to produce optimum cooling capacity, heating capacity, net power, distilled water, and hydrogen of 123.59 MW, 0.73 MW, 280.35 MW, 18.14 kg/s, and 0.2432 kg/s, respectively. Under this circumstance, the thermal efficiency, exergy efficiency, unit product cost (UPC) of the system, and environmental penalty cost rate are calculated 72.75%, 50.21%, 6.79 $/GJ, and 168 $/h, respectively. Additionally, among all components, reactor core and among different sub-systems, the gas turbine-modular helium reaction (GT-MHR) cycle has the highest contribution to the overall exergy destruction. Finally, a complete sensitivity study based on key thermodynamic, thermoeconomic, and environmental parameters is performed and results are extended and discussed.

AB Current air conditioning systems have become consistently energy-efficient, but usually, these systems represent the largest electricity consumer in residential, commercial and industrial buildings. The variability in electricity costs also imposes uncertainties in the future operational costs of air conditioning installations. This study presents an economic analysis considering technical aspects related to the integrated use of solar photovoltaic, as a complementary energy source, and air conditioning systems connected to the utility grid. Two different systems, variable refrigerant flow and chillers, were analyzed in two cities in Brazil, Recife and Sao Paulo, with varying levels of irradiation and temperature. A mathematical model to evaluate the economic benefits of the integrated use of these systems was implemented considering conditionals and functional aspects of the locations, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. A sensitivity analysis using Sobol's method to determinate the most sensitive parameters affecting the economic results of the proposed system has been carried out. The results reveal high economic viability for all the systems studied and their most critical variables, namely energy price, energy price annual adjustment, photovoltaic cost and solar panel efficiency. Finally, the findings show that the implementation of air conditioning systems with solar photovoltaic energy could assure high internal rate of return for both cities, with average values around 28% for Recife and 22% for Sao Paulo, and the variable refrigerant flow system simulations resulted in better indexes when compared to chiller indexes.

AB A novel trigeneration integrated system is proposed and analyzed in this paper. The present system utilizes gas turbine exhaust gas for heat recovery and capturing carbon dioxide after expanding in the turbine and generating electricity. Moreover, a Cu-Cl thermochemical cycle is incorporated in the system to produce hydrogen, and a multi-effect desalination is integrated to provide fresh water to the Cu-Cl cycle and for domestic use as well. The present integrated system is modeled and simulated using the Aspen Plus software package for chemical processes and Engineering Equation Solver for the remaining subsystems. Both energy and exergy analyses are performed to study and assess the proposed system through energy and exergy efficiencies. Therefore, the overall energy and exergy efficiencies of the proposed trigeneration system are found to be 39.72% and 55.2% respectively.

AB To properly evaluate, control and optimize photovoltaic (PV) systems, it is crucial to accurately estimate the equivalent electric circuit parameters from the respective mathematical models that characterize the PV cells or modules behavior. This is currently a hot research topic that has attracted the attention of numerous researchers. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid methodology that combines diversification and intensification mechanisms from different metaheuristics (MHs) to estimate PV parameters precisely. The proposed methodology has the capacity to adapt to the specific optimization problem and maintain diversity when building solutions, thus mitigating premature convergence and population stagnation. This methodology can incorporate several MHs (two or more swarms) with different potentialities, enabling a good balance between diversification and intensification mechanisms. Furthermore, it is able to explore a multidimensional search space in different regions simultaneously. To validate its performance, the proposed methodology was compared with other well-established MHs in several benchmark functions, and used to estimate PV parameters in single and double-diode models in two case studies, the first using standard literature data, and the second using measured data from a real application with and without the occurrence of partial shading. The proposed methodology was able to find highly accurate solutions with reduced computational cost and high reliability. Comparisons with the other MHs demonstrate that the proposed methodology presents a very competitive performance when solving the PV parameter estimation problem.

AB This paper, which is the first part of a study on multi-stage recuperative Brayton cycle configurations, evaluates the thermodynamic and economic feasibility of hybridizing different multi-stage recuperative Brayton cycle configurations with a solar power tower using a pressurized air receiver. In part 2 of this work, the waste energy recovery from non-solar multi-stage recuperative Brayton cycle configurations is evaluated from both thermodynamic and economic viewpoints. The results of this first part of work show that the employment of multi-stage recuperative Brayton cycle configurations leads to a significant increase in the thermal efficiency and a reduction in the fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for both non-solar and hybrid solar power plants. For non-solar power plants, the cycle configuration with 4 stages of intercooling and reheating showed the highest thermal efficiency (53.6%) and the lowest LCOE ($57.80/MWh) leading to a 32% increase and a 17% decrease compared to a simple recuperative Brayton cycle. Results of this study demonstrate that hybridization of multi-stage recuperative Brayton cycle configurations with a power tower plant with a pressurized air receiver is not economically and environmentally attractive at current time. The main reasons are the technological limitations of pressurized air receiver due to lower temperature (1223 K) and pressure (30 bar) as well as the high cost of solar power tower system (especially the heliostats). Advances in the future that enables a higher output temperature and pressure for the receiver as well as reduction in the heliostats and receiver costs would certainly be useful in improving the economic and environmental attractiveness of such hybridizations.

AB Multi-stage gas turbine cycle configurations can greatly contribute to improve the economic and environmental aspects of gas turbine power plants. In the first part of this work, the hybridization of multi-stage recuperative Brayton power cycles with a solar power tower system that used a pressurized air receiver was evaluated. In this work, a detailed thermodynamic and economic analysis was conducted to evaluate the waste energy recovery from a non-solar multi-stage recuperative Brayton cycle configuration that showed the lowest levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) in the first part. A comparative analysis between different organic Rankine cycles (ORCs) and supercritical CO2 power cycles was conducted for waste energy recovery from both intercooling stages and the exhaust gas. After designing the systems, a transient analysis was conducted to consider the effect of off-design conditions on the cycles thermo-economic performance. The obtained results showed that waste energy recovery using an ORC is the most economical option. By recovering the available heat in intercooling and exhaust gas stages by ORCs that use Isobutane and Toluene as working fluids, respectively, an additional power of 3508 kW was generated. Also, thermal efficiency was increased from 53.6% to 59.9% and the LCOE was reduced from $57.80/MWh to $54.77/MWh. Overall, the results demonstrated that waste energy recovery from intercooling stages and exhaust gas of a multi-stage gas turbine power plant is an attractive option for improving its thermal and economic performance. Also, considering the high price of a solar power tower plant and the technological pressure and temperature limitation of a pressurized air receiver, waste energy recovery is a more practical and beneficial option at current time than hybridization with a solar power tower plant.

TI Assessment of COPD-related outcomes in patients initiating a once daily
   or twice daily ICS/LABA
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English

   furoate/vilanterol; Budesonide/formoterol; Cost
ID EXACERBATIONS; PREVALENCE
AB Background: Use of inhaled corticosteroids and long acting beta agonist (ICS/LABA) combination therapy has been shown to decrease the frequency of exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this population, adherence to treatment is associated with better disease control and lower risk of COPD-related exacerbations in the future. Using a treatment with a more convenient regimen or easier-to-use device could improve patient adherence, improve disease control, decrease the frequency of exacerbations and minimize the COPD-related economic burden. Real-world information on the impact on healthcare costs and exacerbation risk of initiating once-daily or twice daily ICS/LABA in this patient population is limited.
   The objective of this study was to assess COPD-related healthcare costs, adherence, and exacerbations in COPD patients initiating treatment with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100/25 (FF/VI) or budesonide/formoterol 160/4.5 (BUD/F) using a large managed care database in the US.
   Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study among COPD patients initiating FF/VI or BUD/F between January 01, 2014 and June 30, 2016. The analysis used the Optum Research Database (ORD) which contains patients from commercial and Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MAPD) plans. The study included new initiators of ICS/LABA as either FF/VI or BUD/F for COPD, >= 40 years of age at index, >= 15 months of continuous enrollment (12 months pre-index and >= 3 months post-index). New users of FF/VI or BUD/F were matched on baseline characteristics using propensity score matching (PSM) methods. Multivariate models including ordinary least squares regression, Lin's regression, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards were used to assess differences between the cohorts on outcomes of interest.
   Results: A total of 18,652 subjects met all inclusion and exclusion criteria with 5044 initiating FF/VI and 13,608 initiating BUD/F. Of these, 9026 subjects were matched at a 1:1 ratio (4513 patients in each cohort) and were included in the final analyses.
   Proportion of days covered (PDC), was significantly better for FF/VI (mean PDC [SD]: FF/VI: 0.46 [0.31], BUD/F: 0.41 [0.29], p < 0.001) while FF/VI was associated with a 9% lower risk (adj. hazard ratio (HR): 0.91, 95% CI: 0.85-0.96) of having a moderate or severe COPD-related exacerbation. However, COPD-related healthcare costs were not significantly different, $11,521 vs $10,986, p = 0.41 for FF/VI and BUD/F, respectively.
   Conclusions: Patients initiating once-daily FF/VI were more adherent, and were associated with a lower risk of subsequent COPD-related exacerbations compared with twice-daily BUD/F, however this was not associated with a significant difference in costs. (GSK Study HO1617333/206702).

AB Background: Bronchiectasis is a chronic pulmonary disease characterized by progressive and irreversible bronchial dilatation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the etiologies and clinical features of bronchiectasis in Korean children.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective review of the medical records for children diagnosed with bronchiectasis between 2000 and 2017 at 28 secondary or tertiary hospitals in South Korea.
   Results: A total of 387 cases were enrolled. The mean age at diagnosis was 9.2 +/- 5.1 years and 53.5% of the patients were boys. The most common underlying cause of bronchiectasis was preexisting respiratory infection (55.3%), post-infectious bronchiolitis obliterans (14.3%), pulmonary tuberculosis (12.3%), and heart diseases (5.6%). Common initial presenting symptoms included chronic cough (68.0%), recurrent pneumonia (36.4%), fever (31.1%), and dyspnea (19.7%). The most predominantly involved lesions were left lower lobe (53.9%), right lower lobe (47.1%) and right middle lobe (40.2%). No significant difference was observed in the distribution of these involved lesions by etiology. The forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) levels were lowest in cases with interstitial lung disease-associated bronchiectasis, followed by those with recurrent aspiration and primary immunodeficiency.
   Conclusions: Bronchiectasis should be strongly considered in children with chronic cough and recurrent pneumonia. Long-term follow-up studies on pediatric bronchiectasis are needed to further clarify the prognosis and reduce the disease burden in these patients.

AB Background: Patients with connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD) often experience impaired health status. In daily clinical practice, a short and easy instrument for assessing health status would be useful to help better understand the patient's condition. The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) is a simple questionnaire about respiratory symptoms and their impact. We aimed to examine the CAT's performance characteristics and to generate data to support its reliability and validity in patients with CTD-ILD.
   Methods: We used data from 132 CTD-ILD patients evaluated at Tosei General Hospital from July 2011 to July 2016 to assess the cross-sectional and longitudinal validity of the CAT.
   Results: The mean age of the patients was 64.5 years and 87 (66%) were women. There were no significant differences in CAT score between any of the CTD subgroups. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.881) and repeatability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.803) for the CAT score were acceptable. At baseline, CAT score was significantly associated with clinically meaningful measures of physiologic function, exercise capacity, and dyspnea. Change in CAT score over 6-12 months was also associated with change in other measures. In the distribution-and anchor-based analyses, the estimated minimal clinically important difference of CAT score was 1-4 points.
   Conclusion: These data support the validity and reliability of CAT as a sensitive measure for assessing health status in patients with CTD-ILD.

AB Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of carvacrol on serum level of inflammatory mediators and respiratory symptoms in the veterans exposed to sulfur mustard (SM).
   Methods: Twenty-one patients who were exposed to SM more than two decades' ago were divided to placebo and carvacrol (1.2 mg/kg/day) treated groups. Serum levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Epidermal growth factor (EGF), forced expiratory volume-one second (FEV1) and respiratory symptoms including; Chest wheeze (CW), night wheeze (NW), night cough (NC) and cough and wheeze during exercise (ECW) were assessed at the baseline (step 0), one and two months after starting treatment (step I and II, respectively).
   Findings: FEV1 value was significantly increased in carvacrol treated group in step II compared to step 0 (p < 0.001) and also increased in step II compared to step I (p < 0.05). The respiratory symptoms including; CW and NW was significant decreased in carvacrol treated group in step I and II compared to step 0 (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001), NC and ECW were significantly decreased only in step II compared to step 0 (p < 0.01, for both cases). The serum levels of TNF-alpha, EGF and VEGF were decrease in carvacrol treated group in step I and II compared to step 0 (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). The serum level of MCP-1 was decrease in carvacrol treated group only in the step II compared to step 0 (p < 0.05).
   Interpretation: Two months' treatment with carvacrol reduced inflammatory cytokine and chemokine while increased anti-inflammatory cytokines and improved respiratory symptom and FEV1 value in SM exposed patients.

AB Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a category of diffuse parenchymal lung diseases characterized by inflammation and/or fibrosis. The best characterized ILD is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Acute exacerbation of IPF is a dreaded occurrence with grim prognosis and suboptimal treatment options. There have been recent reports that acute exacerbation can occur in other ILDs (AE-ILD). Of note, some of these acute exacerbations follow lung procedures. This review summarizes the available information on AE-ILD and discusses the procedures reported to cause AE-ILD. We also discuss proposed mechanisms, risk factors, treatment and prognosis. This review should help to inform decision-making about risks versus benefits of procedures that are commonly recommended to diagnose ILD.

   MEPOLIZUMAB; MANAGEMENT; STRATEGY; ATTACKS; FEV1
AB Background: Low forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) is a risk factor for asthma exacerbations (AEs). We aimed to determine if asthma control could reduce the future risk of AEs in patients with low FEV1. This study was conducted to evaluate the future risks of AEs within six months according to Asthma Control Test T (ACT) score and FEV1.
   Methods: A total of 565 patients with asthma were enrolled from the COREA cohort. The ACT score, lung function test, and number of AEs were assessed at baseline, three-month follow-up, and six-month follow-up with conventional asthma treatments by asthma specialists in real clinical settings.
   Results: Female sex, low ACT score, low FEV1, low FVC, and AE history in the previous three months were related with increased AEs within six months. AEs during six-month follow-up occurred in 24% of patients with ACT < 20 and FEV1 < 60% at baseline. Among patients with an ACT score >= 20, 3.4% of patients with an FEV1 < 2.16 L and 9.8% of patients with FEV1 >= 2.16 L had experienced AEs (P = 0.01), although no differences were observed in the presence of AEs within six months according to the predicted FEV1 (FEV1 >= 60% vs. FEV1 < 60%, 5.66% vs. 8.51%, P = 0.65).
   Conclusion: Patient with low FEV1 seemed to show higher risk of AEs than those with near-normal FEV1 despite ACT score >= 20 and asthma treatments. Therefore, treatment strategies that prevent AEs are needed in high-risk asthmatic patients.

AB Purpose: We aimed to investigate the natural history of non-cavitary nodular bronchiectatic (NC-NB) Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease (LD).
   Methods: Among all patients diagnosed with NC-NB MAC LD between March 2000 and December 2013, 551 patients who were followed until December 2017 were enrolled at a tertiary referral center in South Korea. Patients were subdivided into progressive and stationary groups, depending on whether treatment was initiated within 3 years after diagnosis. We investigated the proportion of patients not receiving anti-MAC treatment within 3 years after the diagnosis. The rate for spontaneous sputum conversion in the untreated group was also calculated.
   Results: The mean age of 551 patients was 61.1 years. During the median 5.8 years of follow-up, 323 (58.6%) patients received treatment within 3 years (progressive group), whereas the remaining 228 (41.4%) patients did not (stationary group). Multivariate analysis revealed that age <= 60 years, a positive sputum smear, the presence of systemic symptoms, body mass index > 18.5 kg/m(2), and the involvement of >= 4 lobes were predictors of receiving treatment. Additionally, during the median of 5.0 years follow-up, spontaneous sputum conversion occurred in 52.2% of patients who did not receive treatment.
   Conclusions: Among patients diagnosed with NC-NB MAC LD, approximately 40% did not receive antibiotic treatment within 3 years of diagnosis. Moreover, about 50% of untreated patients experienced spontaneous sputum conversion.

AB Systemic/oral corticosteroids (OCS) have been used for decades in the management of acute asthma exacerbations and chronically in patients with uncontrolled severe asthma. However, while OCS are effective at treating acute exacerbations, there is only empirical evidence regarding the efficacy of OCS at reducing the rate of exacerbations. Evidence, although scarce, is suggestive of high exacerbation rates in severe asthma patients even when receiving maintenance treatment with OCS. In addition, use of OCS is associated with undesirable effects. Despite all this, physicians have continued to use OCS for managing severe asthma and acute exacerbation due to the lack of availability of effective alternatives. Fortunately, in the last decade several biologics have been proven safe and effective for patients with uncontrolled severe asthma. This has led to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) recommending the use of biologics, instead of maintenance OCS, in patients with severe asthma (GINA Step 5). These include one biologic targeting immunoglobulin E (IgE) (omalizumab), and different biologics targeting interleukin-5 (IL-5), the IL-5 receptor (IL-5R) or IL-4 receptor alpha-unit (IL-4R alpha), including mepolizumab (subcutaneous), reslizumab (intravenous), benralizumab (subcutaneous) and dupilumab (subcutaneous).
   Omalizumab for the treatment of severe allergic asthma reduces exacerbations, irrespective of blood eosinophil levels. Anti-IL-5/IL-5R biologics are indicated in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma and repetitive exacerbations, irrespective of the presence or absence of allergy. Recently, an anti-IL4R alpha biologic has been approved by the FDA for eosinophilic phenotype or oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma. Finally, physicians should consider using biologics as an alternative to chronic OCS therapy.

AB Purpose: Myositis-associated interstitial lung disease (MA-ILD) is associated with increased mortality, but no prognostic model exists in this population. The ILD-GAP index was developed to predict mortality risk across all subtypes of chronic ILD. The purpose of this study was to validate the ILD-GAP risk prediction model in patients with MA-ILD.
   Procedures: We completed a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients enrolled in the Johns Hopkins Myositis Center database between 2006 and 2017. Cumulative mortality rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier test. Model calibration was determined by using standardized mortality ratios of observed versus expected deaths.
   Main findings: 179 participants with MA-ILD were included. The mean baseline percent predicted forced vital capacity was 65.2 +/- 20.6%, forced expiratory volume in the first second 65.4 +/- 20.4%, and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity 61.6 +/- 20.0%. Thirty-two participants died (17.9%). The ILD-GAP model had poor discriminative performance and calibration.
   Conclusions: The ILD-GAP risk prediction model is a poor predictor of mortality among individuals with MA-ILD. The identification of a better predictive model for MA-ILD is needed to help guide care in this patient population.

AB Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) has long been associated with poor asthma control without an established cause-effect relationship.
   610 asthmatics (421 severe/88 mild-moderate) and 101 healthy controls were assessed clinically and a subset of 154 severe asthmatics underwent proteomic analysis of induced sputum using untargeted mass spectrometry, LC-IMS-MSE. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses (MLR) were conducted to identify proteins associated with GORD in this cohort.
   When compared to mild/moderate asthmatics and healthy individuals, respectively, GORD was three-and ten-fold more prevalent in severe asthmatics and was associated with increased asthma symptoms and oral corticosteroid use, poorer quality of life, depression/anxiety, obesity and symptoms of sino-nasal disease. Comparison of sputum proteomes in severe asthmatics with and without active GORD showed five differentially abundant proteins with described roles in antimicrobial defences, systemic inflammation and epithelial integrity. Three of these were associated with active GORD by multiple linear regression analysis: Ig lambda variable 1-47 (p = 0.017) and plasma protease C1 inhibitor (p = 0.043), both in lower concentrations, and lipocalin-1 (p = 0.034) in higher concentrations in active GORD.
   This study provides evidence which suggests that reflux can cause subtle perturbation of proteins detectable in the airways lining fluid and that severe asthmatics with GORD may represent a distinct phenotype of asthma.

AB Objective: Some evidences indicate that exposure to molds or their products can be relevant for the loss of asthma control. Thus, we measured the mold burden present inside houses of subjects with asthma, and evaluated its relationship with asthma control.
   Methods: Markers of asthma control in adult patients residing in Mexico City were evaluated through questionnaires and spirometry. Dust was collected from the patients' houses and its fungal content was determined by mold specific quantitative PCR (MSQPCR) for 36 fungal species.
   Results: Forty-two patients with asthma (12 males, 30 females) with a mean age of 45 years (18-76 years) were included in the study. The level of asthma control measured through the Asthma Control Test ranged from 9 to 25 (mean 20.9). The FEV1/FVC ratio fluctuated from 38 to 106 %predicted (mean, 87.4 %predicted). Associations between mold burden and asthma control differed between males and females. Thus, concentrations of some molds, particularly Aspergillus fumigatus, Aureobasidium pullulans, Stachybotrys chartarum, Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium cladosporioides 2, Cladosporium herbarum, and Epicoccum nigrum, were negatively associated with parameters of asthma control in male subjects, but not in female patients.
   Conclusion: Our results showed that potential indoor exposure to some molds is associated with less asthma control in male subjects.

DE Pneumonia; Diagnosis
ID COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA
AB Using data from a large randomised controlled trial of adults hospitalised with acute respiratory illness, we examined the reliability of pneumonia diagnosis on discharge documentation. 50 (28.2%) of 177 patients with a pneumonia diagnosis had no radiological evidence of pneumonia. 67 (34.9%) of 192 patients with clinico-radiological evidence of pneumonia did not have a diagnosis of pneumonia listed; 'COPD exacerbation' or 'lower respiratory tract infection' was often listed instead. These patients more frequently had a respiratory comorbidity and lower oxygen saturations, CRP and temperature at presentation. Pneumonia diagnoses misclassification on discharge documentation may have clinical, financial, and research data implications.

ID D SUPPLEMENTATION; D DEFICIENCY; 25-HYDROXYVITAMIN D; CHILDHOOD ASTHMA;
   CHILDREN; ADULTS; INFLAMMATION; THERAPY
AB Background: There is a controversy in terms of the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in improving asthma symptom control. Moreover, whether there is a difference in the treatment effect with respect to baseline vitamin D status remains unknown. This meta-analysis was to assess the correlations of vitamin D status with asthma-related respiratory outcomes.
   Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation in patients with asthma. Primary outcomes were the rate of asthma exacerbation and predicted percentage of forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV1%). Secondary outcomes were asthma control test (ACT) scores, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and adverse events.
   Results: A total of 14 randomized controlled trials (1421 participants) fulfilled the inclusion. Vitamin D supplementation was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of asthma exacerbation by 27% (RR: 0.73 95%Cl (0.58-0.92)). In subgroup analysis, the protective effect of exacerbation was restricted in patients with vitamin D insufficiency (vitamin D < 30 ng/ml) (RR: 0.76 95%Cl (0.61-0.95)). An improvement of FEV1% was demonstrated in patients with vitamin D insufficiency and air limitation (FEV1% < 80%) (MD: 8.3 95%Cl (5.95-10.64). No significant difference was observed in ACT scores, FeNO, IL-10 and adverse events.
   Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation reduced the rate of asthma exacerbation, especially in patients with vitamin D insufficiency. Additionally, the benefit of vitamin D had a positive effect on pulmonary function in patients with air limitation and vitamin D insufficiency.

AB Objective: To assess the predictive factors at 12 month and 10 year adherence to Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) in patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA).
   Methods: Retrospective data analysis of patients starting CPAP between 2006 and 2009. After 12 months (T1) from start and during a 10 year follow up the following data were recorded: Body Mass Index (BMI), Time of night use, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score.
   Results: Out of 315 patients, 147 fulfilled inclusion criteria and were evaluated. According to CPAP nighttime use during the first year, patients were divided into two groups: those using the device less < 4.5 h (Poor Adherence (PA): 61 patients), and those using >= 4.5 h: (Good Adherence (GA): 86 patients). Patients of PA group were significantly younger, had greater BMI and required more unscheduled visits during the first year. After 12 months, there were 11 (7.5%) dropouts, all in PA group. Patients using the nasal mask showed a greater prevalence among GA as compared to those using the oro-nasal mask (76.5% vs 57.8% respectively, p = 0.04). After 10 years 83 out of 147 (56.4%) patients were still under CPAP, 51 (59.3% of GA) and 32 (52.4% of PA group) respectively. Dropouts were significantly more frequent during the first 5 years (p = 0.04).
   Conclusion: Ten years after prescription the majority of patients with OSA undergoing periodical controls, still perform CPAP independent of their adherence to therapy after one year of use. Use of nasal mask may be associate to better adherence.

AB We propose a strategy for serodiagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP): 1) question patients about their private or occupational activity, or visit him on site; 2) select panels of six somatic specific antigens appropriate for each type of exposure; 3) and use ELISA to test concomitantly two recombinant antigens highly specific to Farmer's lung, Metalworking-fluid HP, and for Bird fancier's lung. The serodiagnosis provides an immunological argument that may complete radiological, functional lung exploration and clinical features; 4) If the serodiagnosis is negative but the suspicion of HP is strong, a microbial analysis of the patient's specific exposure is conducted; 5) "A la carte" antigens are produced from the microorganisms isolated in the patient's environment sample and tested; 6) Finally, the patient may be asked to undergo a specific inhalation challenge with the offending antigens in a safety cabin, or to avoid his usual environment for a few days.

AB Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) prevalence is high among patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). OSA can cause increase in carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) in the general population. However, whether this phenomenon is applicable to patients with HCM is unclear.
   Methods: A total of 130 consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) at Fuwai Hospital between September 2017 and May 2018 were analyzed.
   Results: 72 patients (55.4%) were diagnosed with OSA. Patients with OSA were older. Compared to those in patients without OSA, the left, right, and mean CIMTs were significantly increased in patients with OSA. In the multiple linear regression model, age (beta = 0.341, p < 0.001), apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) (beta = 0.421, p < 0.001), and fasting glucose level (beta = 0.167, p < 0.03) were independently associated with mean CIMT increase (adjusted R-2 = 0.458, p < 0.001). In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the area under the curve for CIMT was 0.813 (95% CI, 0.717-0.909, p < 0.001) with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.84 and 0.70 for unexplained syncope, respectively. In the multivariate logistic regression model, we found that the mean CIMT (OR = 10.4, 95% CI = 3.16-34.11, p < 0.001), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.83-0.99, p = 0.03), and amaurosis (OR = 5.07, 95% CI = 1.47-17.49, p = 0.01) were independently associated with unexplained syncope occurrence.
   Conclusions: In patients with HOCM, CIMT increased with OSA severity. Age, AHI, and fasting plasma glucose level were independently associated with mean CIMT increase. Moreover, amaurosis, LVEF, and higher mean CIMT were independently associated with unexplained syncope in patients with HOCM.

DE Adult-onset asthma; Epidemiology; Risk factors; Ethnic disparities
ID AGE
AB Little is known about adult-onset asthma in different ethnic groups. The aim of this study was to examine ethnic differences in the prevalence of adult-onset asthma and factors associated with this phenotype.
   Cross-sectional data of 23,356 participants of the HELIUS study were used, including Dutch, South-Asian Surinamese, African Surinamese, Moroccan, Turkish and Ghanaian origin participants. Adult-onset asthma was defined as: self-reported asthma symptoms or start of asthma-medication at age >= 18 years combined with a smoking history < 10 pack years. The prevalence of adult-onset asthma and its association with potential risk factors were assessed by logistic regression analyses.
   The adjusted prevalence of adult-onset asthma was higher in the Turkish, Moroccan and South-Asian Surinamese groups (4.9-6.0%) compared to the Dutch, Ghanaian and African Surinamese origin groups (2.4-2.6%). In addition to ethnicity, age, female sex, BMI, and doctors' diagnosis of nasal allergy/hay fever and chronic sinusitis/polyps were independently associated with adult-onset asthma.
   There are significant differences in the adjusted prevalence of adult-onset asthma among six ethnic groups.

AB Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal interstitial lung disease characterized by irreversible loss of lung function and an unpredictable course of disease progression.
   Methods: The safety data for patients with IPF who received placebo in 6 clinical trials were pooled to examine the categories and frequencies of serious adverse events (SAEs) in this population.
   Results: In 1082 patients with IPF who received placebo, 673 SAEs were reported. Of these, 93 SAEs resulted in death (8.6% of patients). Respiratory-related conditions were the most frequently reported SAE (225 events, 16.33 per 100 patient-exposure years [PEY]), followed by infections and infestations (136 events, 9.87 per 100 PEY) and cardiac disorders (79 events, 5.73 per 100 PEY); these categories also had the most fatal outcomes (60, 10, and 10 deaths, respectively). The most frequently reported fatal respiratory-related SAEs were IPF and respiratory failure (38 and 11 patients, respectively), and the most frequently reported fatal infections and infestations and cardiac disorders were pneumonia (5 patients) and myocardial infarction (3 patients), respectively.
   Conclusions: This pooled analysis has value as a comparator for safety in future studies of IPF and provides insights in the natural evolution of both IPF and common comorbidities.

AB Background: The clinical characteristics, hemodynamic changes and outcomes of lung disease-associated pulmonary hypertension (LD-PH) are poorly defined.
   Methods: A prospective cohort of PH patients undergoing initial hemodynamic assessment was collected, from which 51 patients with LD-PH were identified. Baseline characteristics and long-term survival were compared with 83 patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH).
   Results: Mean age (+/- standard deviation) of LD-PH patients was 64 +/- 10 years, 30% were female and 78% were New York Heart Association class III-IV. The LD-PH group was older than the iPAH group (64 +/- 10 vs 56 +/- 18 years, respectively, P = 0.003) with a lower percentage of women (30% vs 70%, P = 0.007). LD-PH patients had smaller right ventricular sizes (P = 0.02) and less tricuspid regurgitation (P = 0.03) by echocardiogram, and lower mean pulmonary arterial pressures (mPAP) (P = 0.01) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) (P = 0.001) at catheterization. Despite these findings, mortality was equally high in both groups (P = 0.16). 5-year survival was lower in patients with interstitial lung disease compared to those with obstructive pulmonary disease (P = 0.05). Among the LD-PH population, those with mild to moderately elevated mPAP and those with PVR < 7 Wood units demonstrated significantly improved survival (P = 0.04 and P = 0.001, respectively). Vasoreactivity was not associated with improved survival (P = 0.64). A PVR >= 7 Wood units was associated with increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio (95% confidence interval), 3.59 (1.27-10.19), P = 0.02).
   Conclusions: Despite less severe PH and less right heart sequelae, LD-PH has an equally poor clinical outcome when compared to iPAH. A PVR >= 7 Wood units in LD-PH patients was associated with 3-fold higher mortality.

TI Use of red cell distribution width in a population at high risk for

SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Biomarker; High risk pulmonary hypertension populations; Pulmonary
   arterial hypertension; Red cell distribution width; Systemic sclerosis
ID CLINICAL-USEFULNESS; PROGNOSTIC MARKER; DYSFUNCTION
AB Background: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) often presents with non-specific symptoms making early diagnosis difficult. Red cell distribution width (RDW) is a parameter routinely reported on an automated complete blood cell count that has been associated with numerous disease states. The purpose of this study was to further evaluate RDW as a biomarker for PH in at-risk populations.
   Methods: In a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of patients seen at a PH center over 1 year, we examined both patients with PH and patients at risk for but without PH (e.g. systemic sclerosis, [SSc]). We also studied a group of age-and sex-matched, non-diseased controls. Relevant characteristics were compared among the 3 groups using one-way ANOVA. Similar comparisons were made across World Health Organization (WHO) PH groups 1-4.
   Results: RDW was highest in the PH patients (n = 181), intermediate in the at-risk for PH patients (n = 52), and lowest in matched controls (n = 100) (15.9 +/- 2.8 vs 14.8 +/- 2.8 vs 14.2 +/- 1.1%, respectively; p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in RDW across WHO PH groups (p = 0.50). SSc patients with PH had significantly higher RDW values compared to SSc patients without PH (16.0 +/- 2.2 vs 14.4 +/- 1.9%, respectively; p = 0.03).
   Conclusions: RDW is significantly higher in PH patients, without regard to disease etiology, when compared to age-and sex-matched non-diseased controls. Importantly, RDW is also higher in PH patients compared to at-risk patients, particularly in the SSc cohort. The ease of obtaining RDW as a biomarker may help detect incident PH at earlier stages among patients who are at high risk for development of PH.

TI IL-4/IFN-gamma inflammatory cytokine profile induces a deficient

ID PROSTAGLANDIN E-2; ASPIRIN; RHINOSINUSITIS; LEUKOTRIENE; EXPRESSION;
   POLYPS; GAMMA
AB Background: We hypothesized that the peculiar mixed interleukin-4 (IL-4/Th2) and interferon gamma INF-gamma (INF-gamma/Th1) inflammatory milieu found in the airways of patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is responsible for the altered regulation of the IL-1 beta/IL-1RI-/EP2/COX-2 autocrine loop also found in these patients. The objective of the study is to demonstrate that IL-4 and INF-gamma cytokines, are capable of inducing in healthy nasal mucosa (NM) the dysregulation of the autocrine loop of COX reported in AERD.
   Subjects and methods: Fibroblasts were obtained from NM (n = 8). To evaluate the role of IL-4 and IFN-gamma on the autocrine loop, fibroblasts were incubated with or without IL-1 beta, in the presence or absence of IL-4 and/or IFN-gamma for 48 h. After this period, the expression of EP2, EP3, EP4, IL-1RI, COX-2 and mPGES-1 was measured by Western blot.
   Results: Stimulation of fibroblasts with IL-1 beta significantly increased the expression of EP2, but had no effects on EP3 and EP4 expression Incubation with IL-4 or IFN-gamma alone was not able to modify the expression of any of the components of the autocrine loop. In contrast, co-treatment with IL-4 and IFN-gamma was able to significantly inhibit IL-1 beta-induced EP2, IL-1RI, COX-2 and mPGES-1.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that the mixed Th1/Th2 inflammatory pattern found in the airways of AERD patients might be responsible for the altered regulation of the COX pathway also reported in these asthma patients.

AB Background: The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) has been proposed to help guide therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is important to understand the distribution of scores in different COPD populations and their determinants.
   Methods: The POPE study is an international, observational cross-sectional study of COPD subjects in 11 Central and Eastern European countries aimed at characterizing COPD phenotypes. Here we report the analysis of CAT scores with the objective of identifying their determinants, evaluating symptom load and investigating the distribution of scores among the participating countries. Additionally, we investigated the discrepancies between the CAT and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scores when used to classify patients according to the GOLD strategy.
   Results: The study included 3452 patients (69.2% men, mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1% predicted) 52.5%). The mean CAT score was 17.5 (SD = 7.8), ranging from 15.1 in Hungary to 21.2 in Bulgaria. Multiple linear regression analysis showed six variables significantly associated with CAT scores: depression, number of previous exacerbations, 6-min walking distance, FEV1(%), mMRC and country and explained 47.2% of the variance of CAT. According to either CAT or mMRC, up to 23.9% patients would be classified in different GOLD groups.
   Conclusions: The CAT score may be predicted by factors related to COPD severity, depression and exercise capacity, with significant differences in the distribution of CAT scores in different countries. According to our results CAT > 10 is not equivalent to mMRC > 2 for assessing symptom burden.

AB Background: Severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization induces long term immunological and respiratory abnormalities. The long-term immunomodulation effect of Palivizumab (RSV monoclonal antibody) prophylaxis and its impact on the development of asthma remain controversial. Our aim was to evaluate airway hyper-reactivity, systemic inflammatory markers, allergic parameters and respiratory morbidity, 5-7 years following Palivizumab administration to children born at 29-32 weeks of gestation (WGA).
   Methods: Children born at 29-32 WGA were evaluated at age 5-7 years. Methacholine challenge test (MCT), serum inflammatory cytokines, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), blood tests for eosinophil count, IgE and assessment of respiratory morbidity by questionnaire were compared between those born before Palivizumab prophylaxis was extended to 29-32 WGA and those who received Palivizumab prophylaxis.
   Results: Of 42 children recruited, 27 received Palivizumab and 15 did not. The mean gestational age and weight were lower in the Palivizumab group. Similar values of spirometry, MCT, FeNO and allergic parameters were observed in the two groups. The Palivizumab group had higher IL4, IL5 and IL13 (Th2 cytokines), IL6, IL17 alpha, and G-CSF (Th17 activation), and lower IL12 and higher INF-gamma (Th1 cytokines).
   Conclusion: Compared to children who did not receive immunoprophylaxis, among children who received Palivizumab, no beneficial effects on long-term respiratory morbidity, airway reactivity or allergic parameters were observed, and levels of Th2 and Th17 cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma were higher. These findings cast doubt on the potential long-term beneficial effect of Palivizumab on asthma inception.

AB Background: The term Interstitial Pneumonia with Autoimmune Features (IPAF) describes patients with Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILDs) and clinical or serological features of autoimmune diseases insufficient to reach a specific classification of a Connective Tissue Disease (CTD). Currently, retrospective studies on IPAF patients have proven to be heterogeneous in general characteristics, outcomes and High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) pattern. This study aims to describe for the first time the clinical, serological and radiological features of a prospective cohort of IPAF patients. This cohort is then compared to a group of patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF).
   Material and methods: From 626 consecutive ILD patients evaluated, 45 IPAF and a comparison cohort of 143 IPF patients were enrolled. All patients underwent clinical assessment with rheumatologic and respiratory evaluation, HRCT, Pulmonary Function Tests and Nailfold Videocapillaroscopy.
   Results: The IPAF patients had a predominance of female gender (62.12%) with a median age of 66 years. The most common findings were: Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP, 68.89%), Antinuclear Antibody positivity (17.77%) and Raynaud Phenomenon (31.11%). In comparison with IPF, IPAF patients showed younger age, better performances in Pulmonary Function Tests, less necessity of O-2 support and predominance of female sex and NSIP pattern.
   Discussion: This is the first report of a prospective cohort of IPAF patients. IPAF patients seem to have a less severe lung disease than IPF. IPAF criteria probably need to be revisited and validated, but their capacity to recruit patients with incomplete forms or early onset of CTD could be useful for further research.

DE Asthma; Thermoplasty; Consensus
ID REDUCTION; ASTHMA; SAFETY
AB Background: Bronchial Thermoplasty (BT) is a bronchoscopic treatment for severe asthma. Following research trials there remains a need to guide BT treatment in clinical practice, specifically in the fields of patient assessment, selection and positioning of BT within the range of treatment modalities, BT treatment protocols and post-BT management and follow-up. Consensus statements can bridge the gap between evidence-based medicine and real world clinical practice.
   Methods: We performed a modified RAND consensus analysis using a baseline list of statements derived from ATS/ERS Guidelines on Severe Asthma, Cochrane review and UK commissioning guidance. A panel of 5 European BT experts, individually scored the statements and following a day of discussion, rescored a revised final list independently.
   Results: An initial list of 132 statements, were independently scored. These were modified to 108 following group discussion. Consensus/total agreement was reached for 68 (63%) of the statements; 8 (7.4%) statements achieving total disagreement. For only 17 statements, could some form of consensus not be achieved.
   Conclusions: The consensus document could be applied to guide BT clinical practice and used to serve as a minimum acceptable level of assessment for BT, drive the development of clinical practice protocols and help define quality indicators

TI Effect of bronchial thermoplasty on structural changes and inflammatory
   mediators in the airways of subjects with severe asthma
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Bronchial thermoplasty; Severe asthma; Airway smooth muscle; Airway
   remodeling; Airway nerves; Inflammatory mediators
ID SEVERE REFRACTORY ASTHMA; SMOOTH-MUSCLE; OPTION; SAFETY
AB Background: Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) is a novel technique used in the treatment of subjects with severe refractory asthma. Radiofrequency is provided to airway walls during bronchoscopy in order to reduce airway remodeling. Several clinical studies have reported an improvement in subjects' symptoms following BT. However, how BT affects the airway architectures and inflammatory mediators in the airways has not been yet fully elucidated.
   Methods: Fourteen subjects with severe asthma were recruited in this study according to the criteria of ATS severe asthma definition. The study subjects undertook bronchial biopsy during the bronchoscopy procedure at baseline and 6 weeks after the initial BT treatment. The obtained samples were stained with antibodies for alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA); protein gene product (PGP) 9.5, a specific nerve marker; von Willebrand factor (vWF), a marker for blood vessels; interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1).
   Results: The expression of alpha-SMA and PGP9.5 were significantly reduced post-BT. There was no significant difference in the number of blood vessels between baseline and post-BT. In addition, BT did not affect the production of IL-17A and TGF-beta 1 in the airways. The changes in the expression of alpha-SMA and PGP9.5 had no significant correlation with the improvement of pulmonary function.
   Conclusion: and Clinical Relevance: This study suggests that BT reduces airway smooth muscle mass and the airway innervation without affecting vasculature and the production of inflammatory mediators in the airways of subjects with severe asthma.

AB BACKGROUND: Osteonecrosis of bone flaps after cranioplasty with autologous cryoconserved bone flaps is a common phenomenon. The exact reason for it remains unknown.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a 67-year-old patient who had a bone flap necrosis after elective craniotomy and underwent secondary cranioplasty. A low-grade infection with Propionibacterium acnes was detected in microbiologic samples from the bone flap as the cause of the lysis. We discuss similarities with aseptic implant loosening and present recent evidence that low-grade infections might be the underlying reason in several cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that low-grade infections play an underestimated role in bone flap necrosis after cranioplasty as well and encourage routine microbiologic sampling (extended culture and polymerase chain reaction) to rule out infection in all similar cases and suggest a routine antibiotic therapy until final microbiologic results.

   syndrome; Chronic subdural hematoma; Fluid attenuated inversion recovery
ID BLOOD-FLOW; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Although chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) has a good prognosis after classical minimally-invasive drainage surgery, severe complications still occur at a substantial rate. Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS), which is a common severe complication after carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting for cervical carotid artery stenosis, is rare after drainage surgery for a CSDH.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe the case of an 82-year-old woman who presented with ipsilesional symptoms including contralateral hemiparesis and dysarthria, progressively worsening consciousness, and status epilepticus after a burr hole drainage surgery for CSDH. Magnetic resonance fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging showed diffuse subcortical low intensity in the ipsilesional hemisphere almost simultaneously with the appearance of the symptoms. Arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance perfusion imaging showed the abnormal increase of cerebral blood flow in the hemisphere. Continuous propofol administration and blood pressure management improved the symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: CHS can cause severe postoperative complications after drainage surgery for CSDH. Subcortical low-intensity fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging is a useful investigation for early detection of CHS in CSDH, and arterial spin labeling imaging is an effective minimally-invasive modality for confirming the diagnosis.

DT Article
DE Endoscopic endonasal surgery; Ethanol cauterization; Pituitary adenoma;
   Rathke cleft cyst
AB BACKGROUND: Although pituitary adenoma (PA) and Rathke cleft cyst (RCC) share a common embryologic origin, concurrent appearances have rarely been reported. We present a case of intractable RCC hidden behind a coexisting giant PA.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 39-year-old woman presented to an ophthalmologist with visual disturbance. Brain magnetic resonance imaging findings showed a giant mass in the intrasellar and suprasellar portion, with a cystic portion contained in the posterior part. Endoscopic endonasal surgery was performed to remove the tumor, and histopathologic findings revealed a nonfunctioning PA. Further brain magnetic resonance imaging showed the appearance of a residual cyst. A second endonasal endoscopic surgery was performed to relieve compression of the optic chiasm by the growing cyst, followed by cyst drainage and irrigation, and portions of the cyst walls were obtained. The histopathologic diagnosis was RCC with inflammation. Over the course of 1 year, 3 separate recurrences of the growing cyst were noted, with cyst drainage and irrigation performed each time. Finally, ethanol cauterization was performed, which stopped the symptomatic RCC recurrence. Eight years after the final procedure, there was no cyst recurrence, and the patient's condition was good with improved visual acuity and normal pituitary function.
   CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a nonenhanced cyst with a PA on magnetic resonance imaging suggests the possibility of coexisting RCC and PA.

ID CAROTID-BODY TUMOR; NECK PARAGANGLIOMAS; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; HEAD;
   MANAGEMENT; EMBOLIZATION; DIAGNOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Paragangliomas are neuroendocrine neoplasms that arise from the extra-adrenal paraganglia of the autonomic nervous system. Approximately 3% of all paragangliomas occur in the head and neck region. Most reported cases are benign and unilateral. We present a rare case of bilateral malignant paragangliomas.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 28-year-old woman presented with a 10-year history of bilateral neck swelling. Physical examination showed bilateral neck masses with obvious pulsation. Enhanced computed tomography revealed 2 irregular solid nodules, located in the left and right carotid artery bifurcation, respectively. Carotid artery angiography showed compression of the internal and external carotid arteries by the tumors on both sides. On diagnosis of the bilateral carotid body tumors, preoperative embolization was performed. The left-side lesion and lymph nodes were resected and a diagnosis of malignant paraganglioma with lymph node metastasis was made. She was treated with 50-Gy radiotherapy, and computed tomography performed 2 years later showed that the right-side lesion was unchanged. She was symptom-free as of the last follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: The rarity of bilateral malignant paragangliomas makes their management clinically challenging. The primary management of a recognized malignancy should be directed toward complete surgical removal of the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes. Postoperative radiation is beneficial in slowing the progression of residual disease. Genetic studies have shown that familial paragangliomas are associated with germline mutation of SDHD on 11q23.

   thrombosis; Magnetic resonance venography; Sigmoid sinus venous

AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), a rare cerebrovascular condition, is induced by blocked cerebral venous reflux, often presenting nonspecific symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain may improve the often elusive diagnosis of CVT. However, the sensitivity, specificity, and full spectrum of such MRI findings are poorly understood.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 53-year-old male patient with CVT. The patient complained of a severe headache in addition to an enhanced lesion on contrasted T1-weighted MR images, which was originally considered an angiogenic tumor. However, surgery and pathology confirmed the case to be CVT. After surgery and administration of an anticoagulation agent, the patient's symptoms alleviated, and cranial MRI and computed tomography 1 month after surgery showed no abnormalities.
   CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that such cases may occur where CVT appears tumor-like on MRI, including mass effect and abnormal contrast enhancement. Therefore, for young and middle-aged adults with episodic and progressive headaches presenting such MRI findings, the possibility of CVT should always be considered. MRI combined with MR venography should be used as the preferred strategy for early diagnosis of CVT.

TI Cardiac Arrest Induced by Carotid Sinus Reflex Activation During
   Flow-Diverter Stent Deployment
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Carotid sinus reflex; Complication; Flow diverter stent
ID ANEURYSMS; PIPELINE
AB BACKGROUND: A 60-year-old female with multiple carotid aneurysms underwent endovascular treatment with a Pipeline Flex embolization device (PED) under local anesthesia via femoral puncture.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Cardiac arrest occurred when the delivery systems were pushed to promote adequate opening and apposition of the PED against the vessel wall and was recovered to sinus rhythm in approximately 30 seconds by pulling down the microcatheter. The carotid sinus reflex was suspected as the cause of this temporary asystole. Delivery of the PED was accompanied by application of forward pressure on the delivery system. This resulted in buckling of the delivery systems in the neck and likely excessive pressure on the carotid sinus. The procedure was continued and successfully completed with care not to excessively push the system and with the additional use of atropine.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although it was a rare complication, the phenomenon and its mechanisms were known in the carotid artery stenting procedure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of cardiac arrest induced by a carotid sinus reflex during PED deployment. It is important for an operator of PED deployment to recognize its possibility. Vital signs should be closely checked during PED deployment, particularly while pushing the catheter.

TI Terson Syndrome Secondary to Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A Case Report
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Subarachnoid hemorrhage; Terson syndrome; Vitreous hemorrhage
AB BACKGROUND: Terson syndrome is a serious complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) that includes any intraocular hemorrhage and may result in blurred vision or even blindness. However, it is often overlooked clinically.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 42-year-old man presented with coma due to rupture of a left posterior communicating artery aneurysm. A preoperative computed tomography scan demonstrated SAH and bilateral fundus hemorrhage. Visual evoked potential and B-scan ocular ultrasound revealed vitreous hemorrhages, features consistent with Terson syndrome. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed 2 weeks after SAH with a subsequent improvement of visual acuity.
   CONCLUSIONS: Early identification is important for the recovery of the patient's nervous system and ophthalmology. Neurosurgeons should be aware of the pathology and pay attention to it to maximize patient's benefit.

AB OBJECTIVE: Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) related hydrocephalus occurs as the result of tumor growth and sylvian aqueduct obstruction. There is no consensus about the best surgical option; thus, a review has been performed to clarify the rate of success, complications, and possible issues of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) in comparison to other available techniques.
   METHODS: This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, and was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (registration number CRD42018089001). MEDLINE, Web of Knowledge, and EMBASE were searched for published series in which ETV was performed to treat hydrocephalus in DIPG patients.
   RESULTS: Six studies were included. Two further cases from our experience were added for a total amount of 55 patients treated through either ETV, ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS), or ventriculocisternal shunt according to Torkildsen. Eighty-six percent of patients who underwent ETV experienced clinical improvement after surgery (P value 0.03). Torkildsen shunt placement was associated with a 50% failure rate. Two patients implanted with VPS developed symptoms of shunt malfunction and increased ventricular sizes (10%). The Fisher exact test was applied to compare efficacy of VPS and ETV with no statistical difference between the 2 groups (P value 0.17). Patients who underwent ETV did not experience major complications, and no procedural termination was observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: ETV is an effective and safe treatment option, associated with a low complication rate and a high success rate. Evidences from this review suggest considering ETV as the first-line treatment of hydrocephalus in DIPG patients.

LA English
DT Article
DE Embolization; Microcatheter; Microguidewire; Vascular malformations
ID DETACHABLE TIP MICROCATHETER; ARTERIOVENOUS-MALFORMATIONS; ENDOVASCULAR
   TREATMENT; EMBOLIZATION
AB BACKGROUND: Management of vascular malformations requires microcatheter manipulation through distal tortuous arterial feeders <1 mm in diameter to permit safe and effective embolization at the fistula or nidus location. The ASAHI CHIKAI 008 microguidewire (ACM) recently introduced in the United States was used to evaluate microcatheter torque, support, and safety in distal microcatheter navigation.
   METHODS: The use of the ACM in conjunction with flow-directed and over-the-wire microcatheters was evaluated in 25 neuroendovascular cases performed by a single operator for endovascular microcatheter embolization of intracranial vascular malformations over a 1-year period. The study evaluated angiographic evidence of distal microcatheter positioning, subsequent obliteration of the fistula at the location, and any complications.
   RESULTS: The microguidewire was used in microcatheter embolization of 10 vein of Galen malformations, 11 brain and head and neck arteriovenous malformations, 2 spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas, and 2 cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas. Good flow-directed and over-the-wire microcatheter placement using the ACM was possible across the spectrum of cases achieving optimal catheterization and safe embolization in all. There were no microguidewire- or microcatheter-related vessel spasms, dissections, or perforations during combined or individual manipulation and no contrast or embolic extravasation on fluoroscopy or postembolization angiography.
   CONCLUSIONS: The ACM is a safe, sturdy microguidewire that provides good torque in distal arterial anatomy, while providing microcatheter support and maintaining tip configuration on repeated use.

TI Ruptured Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation During Fifth Pregnancy:
   Case Report and Literature Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Review
DE Cerebral arteriovenous malformation; Hemorrhage; Pregnancy; Stroke
ID INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE; RISK
AB BACKGROUND: Whether the risk of rupture of a cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) increases during pregnancy remains controversial. Moreover, it is unclear whether the number of pregnancies correlates with AVM rupture risk. We report a case of ruptured AVM during the fifth pregnancy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 34-year-old woman presenting sudden headache and vomiting was admitted to our hospital. Neuroimaging revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured AVM in the right temporal lobe. She was pregnant (9 weeks and 1 day), and she had previously experienced 4 normal vaginal deliveries (gravidity and parity G4P4) without complications. Elective treatment including neuroendovascular and direct surgery was performed, and the AVM was safely resected (at 15 weeks, 6 days of pregnancy). She underwent elective caesarean section without complications 151 days after the AVM resection (at 37 weeks, 1 day of pregnancy), and the baby was healthy.
   CONCLUSIONS: This report suggests that the risk of AVM rupture persists even after multiple deliveries. Intracranial hemorrhage should be suspected in pregnant patients who underwent multiple deliveries, and a rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment are necessary.

   Malformation: "Hopping on a Stepping Stone"
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Intraoperative electrical stimulation; Lumbosacral lipomatous
   malformation; Root; Untethering
AB OBJECTIVE: In complex lumbosacral lipomatous malformation or retethering, "crotch" dissection, an incision on the dura or lipoma at the site lateral to the lipoma-cord fusion line saving underlying roots, is often not easy. Attempts of this dissection in complex and obscured conditions may cause damage to the spinal cord or nerve roots. A method for caudal extension of untethering while positive areas on electrical stimulation were encountered during the crotch dissection of lumbosacral lipomatous malformation is described.
   METHODS: After thinning out the negative-response area just caudal to the positive-response area, a small perforation is made at the negative-response area skipping the positive-response area with probing the dissection direction through the subarachnoid space by an inside-out fashion. Subsequently, the procedure is continued caudally from the perforation site.
   RESULTS: Safe caudal extension of untethering is possible using this method. Illustrative operative photographs are shown.
   CONCLUSIONS: By using this method, safe untethering can be achieved avoiding root injuries in complicated lipomas such as chaotic or retethering cases.

DT Review
DE Falx cerebri; Schwannoma
ID INTRACEREBRAL SCHWANNOMA
AB BACKGROUND: Schwannomas not related to cranial nerves are rare. Here, we present a case of a schwannoma that originated from the falx cerebri and review reported cases in the literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 36-year-old male experienced generalized seizures following right hemiparesis predominantly in his lower extremity. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a round tumor attached to the falx cerebri on the left side. Radiologically, the tumor appeared to be a falx meningioma. We performed gross total removal of the tumor. Pathology showed a schwannoma that originated from the falx cerebri. Right hemiparesis disappeared soon after surgery.
   CONCLUSION: Although distinguishing a schwannoma of the falx cerebri from a falx meningioma and metastasis is difficult preoperatively, inclusion of schwannoma of the falx cerebri in the differential diagnosis is important, especially when the patient is relatively young and/or the tumor lacks a dural tail sign.

ID PTERYGOPALATINE FOSSA; ENDONASAL APPROACH; RECESS APPROACH; SCHWANNOMA;
   WALL
AB BACKGROUND: The endoscopic endonasal approach to the infratemporal fossa (ITF) has gained popularity. However, the inferior turbinate and/or lacrimal duct are often removed when performing endoscopic medial maxillectomy for ITF approach, and there is potential risk for empty nose syndrome or epiphora. Although the endoscopic prelacrimal recess approach was introduced to avoid these complications, there were some limitations associated with surgical freedom. We report a 2-port endoscopic technique using both prelacrimal recess and antral window as a means to preserve the inferior turbinate and lacrimal duct, while facilitating instrument availability during ITF tumor resection. -
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 3 patients between September 2016 and May 2018 who were treated with a modified 2-port technique for ITF tumors.
   RESULTS: There was 1 case of trigeminal schwannoma originating in the mandibular nerve, 1 recurrent meningioma, and 1 paraganglioma. The 2-port technique was not initially planned in these 3 cases, but it was decided to use the technique during surgery because tumors were extensively attached to surrounding muscles and had profuse bleeding. After tumor resection, sinonasal anatomy including inferior turbinate and lacrimal duct was well preserved.
   CONCLUSIONS: We propose a hybrid endoscopic surgical procedure for ITF tumors using both endoscopic prelacrimal recess approach and transantral window. This technique provides surgeons an adequate working space via a bimanual technique through 2 different ports, while preserving normal sinonasal structures.

Rarely, dural arteriovenous fistulas drain exclusively into perimedullary veins. Prompt diagnosis is important, as the clinical course is potentially life threatening.

Magnetic resonance imaging showed central myelopathy, edema from C6 to T8, and dilated posterior medullary veins. Spinal angiography showed no abnormalities. The diagnostic impression was one of inflammatory demyelinating disease, and the patient was treated with corticosteroids. Three days later, the patient had become paraparetic. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormal vascular structures around the lower brainstem and cervical cord. Cerebral angiography showed a dural fistula at the skull base supplied by the neuromeningeal branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery and draining into the posterior medullary veins. Following neurosurgical referral, the draining vein was clipped just beyond the arterial feeders. At that time, the patient was wheelchair-bound and needed assistance in daily activities.
   CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis of this rare vascular malformation is challenging; angiographic studies must include the cranial vasculature when spinal studies are normal or if the abnormality on magnetic resonance imaging is maximal in the upper spinal cord. In the case described, as only medullary angiography was performed, the intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula with perimedullary venous drainage was not diagnosed. Delayed diagnosis is likely to lead to severe neurologic consequences.

AB OBJECTIVES: Cochleovestibular nerve compression syndrome due to intra-meatal anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) that causes tinnitus is an extremely rare condition with special therapeutic challenges and implications. Here we present the first surgically treated pediatric case of tinnitus showing microvascular conflict of the cochleovestibular nerve and intrameatal AICA loop.
   METHODS: A pediatric case of tinnitus is described, and a surgical technique is elaborated with video material. A PubMed literature search was performed to identify surgically treated pediatric cases of intrameatal compression of the eighth nerve with an AICA loop.
   RESULTS: Tinnitus was completely resolved and hearing was intact immediately after surgical decompression. The patient was free from further symptoms after a short follow-up of 12 weeks. Microsurgical decompression including opening of the internal auditory canal and transposition of the AICA was an effective treatment option in this case.
   CONCLUSION: Decompression of the cochleovestibular nerve including opening of the internal auditory canal and transposition of the AICA appears to be an effective treatment option for cases with radiologically confirmed intrameatal vascular compression of the eighth nerve causing unilateral pulsatile tinnitus.

ID PLASMINOGEN-ACTIVATOR
AB BACKGROUND: Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is the most common disease encountered in neurosurgery. Diagnoses of CSDH are usually made on the basis of computed tomography (CT) images. In this report, we discuss the case of a patient with meningioma whose findings instead suggested CSDH.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 91-year-old woman complained of dizziness. Brain CT imaging revealed a low-density subdural space, following which we diagnosed her with CSDH. On the same day, we performed burr hole surgery. However, when opening the burr hole and cutting the dura, a light yellowish tumor was observed under the dura. After the operation, her condition deteriorated and she died 2 days later. After 10 days, pathologic examination of the tumor specimen led to a diagnosis of atypical meningioma.
   CONCLUSIONS: In almost all cases, CSDH can be diagnosed using CT images only. However, our patient's true diagnosis was meningioma, rather than CSDH. We rouse attention not to take it for CSDH with a CT image easily.

   hematoma
ID SUBDURAL-HEMATOMA; SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE
AB BACKGROUND: We came across a rare case of recurrent hemorrhage from a meningioma. Here, we describe this case and discuss the treatment strategies for recurrent hemorrhage from a meningioma using a literature review.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 61-year-old woman with a history of 2 episodes of hemorrhage from a meningioma originating from the left falx cerebri presented to our outpatient clinic. She was asymptomatic, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a small tumor along the falx cerebri. However, we decided to remove the hemorrhagic meningioma. No abnormal vascular structures were recognized on preoperative angiography and intraoperative evaluation. The tumor was easily removed along the falx cerebri (Simpson grade I). The pathologic diagnosis was transitional meningioma, World Health Organization grade I. The patient experienced no recurrence of tumor or hemorrhage for up to 15 months after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of repeated bleeding from meningiomas is very rare and is seldom reported because the mortality associated with hemorrhage in meningiomas is high (28%-50%). Immediate diagnosis and surgical treatment with both hematoma evacuation and tumor removal are crucial to avoid inadequate and delayed treatment that may cause mortality.

AB Malignant transformation of vestibular schwannoma after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a fatal complication with a relatively less uncommon frequency over the past 5 years. Although SRS has been shown to be an alternative to microsurgical resection of vestibular schwannoma, this complication is disregarded most of the time. In this paper, we present a patient with left cerebellopontine angle vestibular schwannoma that was transformed into a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor after receiving SRS following microsurgical resection.

   PUNCTURE
AB BACKGROUND: Mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke recently proved its superiority to standard medical management alone. With the increasing number of procedures, practitioners are exposed to unexpected situations that may lead to failure of access and significantly worse clinical outcome. Being able to plan the procedure and use alternative techniques may be useful in case of peculiar anatomy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report here the case of a 60-year-old man referred to our institution for an acute ischemic stroke. The patient had an initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 19. The patient's medical history revealed an unspecified cervical treatment at the level of C5-C6 20 years previously. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a left M1 occlusion and the absence of ipsilateral common carotid. The digital subtraction angiography revealed an anastomosis through the left inferior and superior thyroid artery. Mechanical thrombectomy was performed through direct cervical access with a TICI 3 recanalization score.
   CONCLUSIONS: Absence of viable access to perform mechanical thrombectomy during acute ischemic stroke is a rare but pejorative event. Direct common carotid puncture, even in its distal segment, when necessary is a feasible technique to perform internal carotid catheterization.

AB BACKGROUND: The revised World Health Organization classification of central nervous system tumors, published in 2016, has recognized the H3 K27M mutation as a critical genetic signature defining a new group of infiltrative astrocytomas designated as diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M mutant. Although most H3 K27M mutations arise in the setting of diffusely infiltrative tumors, there are rare reports of compact tumors with low-grade histologic features harboring this mutation. The prevalence and clinical significance of this mutation in pilocytic astrocytomas remain unclear.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report 2 young adult patients with H3 K27M-mutated thalamic pilocytic astrocytomas who presented to medical attention with symptomatic hydrocephalus requiring urgent intervention. We present our experience with this unusual tumor and recommend a treatment paradigm of maximal safe surgical resection followed by chemotherapy and radiation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic biopsies may undergrade some adult thalamic pilocytic astrocytomas. Therefore, we recommend that all these tumors be evaluated for the H3 K27M mutation. Further, we think H3 K27M-mutant thalamic pilocytic astrocytomas require aggressive multimodality treatment and these treatments should be guided by the molecular findings, as opposed to the histologic ones.

ID TRANSVENOUS EMBOLIZATION
AB BACKGROUND: Sinus pericranii (SP) is a rare abnormal connection between the intracranial and extracranial venous drainage pathways through the osseous channels. Herein we present the case of a patient with growing SP, which was successfully treated using endovascular transvenous embolization through external compression with a plastic cup for preventing glue migration into subcutaneous veins.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 9-month-old boy presented with a gradually growing mass on the midline cranial vertex after his birth, for which transvenous embolization was performed. A microcatheter was successfully navigated into the SP from the superior sagittal sinus. Because the subcutaneous drainages were confirmed to be multidirectional, we compressed the drainages through the skin using a plastic cup during the glue injection step for preventing glue migration. Subsequently, the SP was completely obliterated. The postoperative course was uneventful.
   CONCLUSIONS: Manual compression using a plastic cup was useful not only for embolization but also for reducing the physician's exposure to radiation as compared with that in the finger compression method. When a direct puncture is required, a plastic cylinder can also be used.

AB Primary spinal glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) of the conus medullaris is a rare and devastating pathologic entity. The presenting symptoms commonly include progressive neurologic deficits in the lower extremities, bowel and bladder dysfunction, and low back pain. Histologically, these tumors have high-grade features similar to their intracranial counterparts. However, recent advancements in the field of molecular oncology have been beginning to elucidate a unique molecular blueprint for these spinal gliomas. Given the lack of standardized treatment strategies, we have presented our institutional experience in treating a small series of patients with conus medullaris GBM and have reviewed the reported data on the relevant molecular markers, management strategies, and complication avoidance for this malignant pathologic entity.

AB BACKGROUND: Double origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery is rare. It has important clinical implications especially in cases of aneurysms of the vertebral artery or the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Several radiologic reports of this variant exist. However, no anatomic illustration of this rarity exists in the literature. This brief report provides the first anatomic illustration of this important variation of the vertebrobasilar system.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A cadaveric specimen was prepared for dissection. A far lateral craniotomy was performed on the right side. While exploring the right cerebellomedullary cistern, 2 separate origins of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery were found from the vertebral artery as the caudal and rostral trunks that joined to form the distal posterior inferior cerebellar artery trunk at the tonsillomedullary segment. Microscopic and endoscopic illustrations are provided.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first anatomic report on the double origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Cadaveric illustration of this variant helps with understanding its anatomic relationship with adjacent neurovascular structures of the cerebellomedullary cistern including the perforating arteries and the lower cranial nerves.

AB BACKGROUND: We report a patient with primary central nervous system mixed malignant germ cell tumor (GCT) who presented with recurrent malignant germinomatous infiltration of the retina.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 10-year-old girl initially presented with a large suprasellar mixed malignant GCT with a near-complete response after initial induction of chemotherapy and irradiation. Three and a half years after initial therapy, she presented with progressively worsening vision in her left eye. Magnetic resonance imaging showed infiltrative changes within the left optic nerve but no discrete mass. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid tumor markers were not elevated and cerebrospinal fluid cytology was negative. Left optic nerve biopsy confirmed the presence of mature teratoma and pure germinoma components. She was treated with gross-total resection of the left eye and optic nerve and chemotherapy. Histopathologic evaluation of the optic nerve showed only mature teratoma elements, but with pure germinoma cells infiltrating the inner layers of the retina.
   CONCLUSIONS: Loco-regional extension of suprasellar GCT to the optic nerve is not uncommon; however, to the best of our knowledge, infiltration of the tumor into the retina is not reported in the literature. Early detection of optic pathway involvement and proper delineation of the irradiation field may prevent GCT infiltration of the retina with subsequent vision loss.

TI Solitary Fibrous Tumor of the Lumbar Spine Resembling Schwannoma: Case
   Report and Review of the Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Immunohistochemistry; Schwannoma; Solitary fibrous tumor; Spinal canal
ID DIAGNOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) are rare tumors derived from mesenchymal tissues. Notably, despite the widespread reports of SFT in various parts of the body, it is extremely rare in the spine, especially the lumbosacral spine, with only 4 previously reported cases.
   CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old Chinese man had experienced low back and right leg pain for 11 years. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine indicated a dumbbell-shaped mass at the right L4 vertebra. After the first surgical resection, the tumor was diagnosed as schwannoma pathologically. Three years later, he presented with low back pain, numbness in both legs, and defecation incontinence. Imaging examination suggested tumor recurrence. Pathologic examination of the second surgical specimen revealed features of SFT. So far, the patient has recovered well through the second extended resection and postoperative radiotherapy.
   CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the fifth reported case of lumbar spine SFT, and its diagnosis is a difficult challenge. However, accurate diagnosis and complete resection of SFT in a patient suspected of having SFT could extend life or improve quality of life.

TI Dural Sandwich Technique for Hemicraniectomy and Benefits During
   Cranioplasty
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

ID DECOMPRESSIVE CRANIECTOMY
AB OBJECTIVE: Hemicraniectomy is a commonly performed neurosurgical procedure used in the setting of medically refractory malignant intracranial hypertension. Complications from cranioplasty after hemicraniectomy can be significant, including infection and wound issues. Difficulty with scar tissue during exposure for cranioplasty can be challenging and can lead to prolonged surgical time and increased bleeding. We describe a surgical technique, termed the "dural sandwich," that could provide a significant benefit during cranioplasty as compared with traditional single-layered dural closure.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted that included 14 patients who underwent a hemicraniectomy procedure over a 4-year period. Seven patients were identified who received a cranioplasty after dural sandwich technique during craniectomy. They were compared with a similar patient group of 7 patients who received a cranioplasty after conventional hemicraniectomy with single-layered dural closure. Surgical time, estimated blood loss, and complication rates were compared between the 2 groups. Analysis of variance measures were performed to assess for statistically significant differences in blood loss and operative time between the dural sandwich and control groups. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.
   RESULTS: The mean estimated blood loss was 82.1 mL in the dural sandwich craniectomy group versus 150 mL in the conventional hemicraniectomy group (P < 0.05). The mean estimated surgical time was 91.7 minutes in the dural sandwich craniectomy group versus 127.5 minutes in the conventional craniectomy group (P < 0.05). There was no evidence of neurologic deterioration, cerebral spinal fluid leak, or postoperative hematoma requiring evacuation in either group. In the conventional craniectomy group, a single report of a wound infection was noted that was treated conservatively with antibiotics.
   CONCLUSIONS: By layering bovine pericardium above and below the dura during initial hemicraniectomy, an artificial plane is created that improves ease of exposure during cranioplasty. This technique could reduce surgical time and blood loss during subsequent cranioplasty, and potentially reduce recovery time and postoperative complications.

AB BACKGROUND: The introduction of operative microscopes (OMs) is the most important revolution in modern microneurosurgery, as a result of the implementation of lighting and magnification of the surgical field and of the capability to dissect the microneurovascular structures. Recently, the advent of video telescopic intraoperative microscopes or exoscopes (EX) has enlarged these perspectives in neurosurgery.
   OBJECTIVE: To systematically review all the pertinent literature.
   METHODS: We systematically reviewed the pertinent literature and collected all the reported experience with EX use in neurosurgery. Quantitative and qualitative data, along with the authors' opinions and concerns, were recorded and analyzed. A comparison with the OM was also considered.
   RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies reporting surgical procedures on 574 patients were included in the study. Data analysis was categorized in 3 groups, representing technical, surgical, and educational aspects. The EX is largely considered superior or equivalent to OM in many features, such as the surgeon's ergonomic comfort, educational opportunities, image quality, magnification, lighting, and costs. However, some surgeons still prefer the OM, especially for its better stereoscopic vision.
   CONCLUSIONS: The EX has been emerging as an alternative to the OM for performing many cranial, spinal, and peripheral neurosurgical procedures. Despite some limitations, this new optical device presents many features that can be considered as an evolution of the OM. In future years, larger studies will confirm these preliminary impressions.

AB BACKGROUND: Most gaseous lumbar pseudocysts have been previously reported to be located in the spinal canal and successfully treated by several therapeutic methods. By comparison, a gas-containing pseudocyst in the lumbar extraforaminal area is rare. Here, the authors report a case of symptomatic gas-containing cyst located in the lumbar foramen. It was successfully treated with unilateral biportal endoscopic (UBE) surgery.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 75-year-old man presented with severe left leg pain and tingling sensation refractory to conservative treatment that aggravated with weight bearing and position change. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a gas-containing cyst compressing the left L5 nerve root ganglion in the foramina area at the L5-S1 level. Gaseous extraforaminal pseudocyst was successfully removed by UBE surgery via the paraspinal approach. Vivid and clear endoscopic operative imaging of pseudocyst in detail was obtained during the operation. The patient's symptom was significantly improved after the operation.
   CONCLUSIONS: A gas-containing pseudocyst in the lumbar foraminal area is not common. Combined use of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography can help diagnose a gaseous pseudocyst and differentiate other pathologies. A UBE technique that provides good operative visualization and delicate operative manipulation is a less invasive therapeutic method to treat a foraminal gas-containing pseudocyst.

AB BACKGROUND: Dumbbell-shaped tumor is a type of inner and outer cervical spinal canal tumor, and most of these are neurogenic. Desmoid tumors are rare, and, to the best of our knowledge, no case of desmoid tumors involving intervertebral foramen formed dumbbell-shaped tumors in the cervical spine have been reported before in English literature. Here we report a case of a desmoid tumor occurring in the cervical spine that is presented as a typical dumbbell-shaped tumor.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 47-year-old woman was admitted to our department with a mass in the left side of her neck. The tumor was initially thought to be a neurogenic cervical dumbbell tumor based on physical and radiologic examination. Postoperative hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining verified the diagnosis of a cervical dumbbell desmoid tumor, which, to our knowledge, had never been reported before. We report our experience and reviewed literature regarding desmoid tumor to share our experience and explore proper treatment options of such lesions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid tumors in the head and neck may present as cervical dumbbell-shaped tumors. Before the treatment plan was made, thorough examinations, including surgical pathology, were necessary.

   Postoperative complication; Takotsubo cardiomyopathy
ID INSULAR CORTEX; BRAIN; PATHOGENESIS; STRESS
AB BACKGROUND: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) and neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) are rare complications of an acute ischemic stroke. In particular, TCM and NPE following carotid endarterectomy (CEA) are extremely rare. In general, TCM- and NPE-associated ischemic strokes are caused by excess catecholamine release after sympathetic nervous stimulation following stroke onset, but the mechanism triggering this stimulation is still unknown.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 88-year-old man underwent left CEA for symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial, 65%). After the surgery, his respiratory condition rapidly worsened, and chest radiography revealed an infiltrative shadow on both lung fields. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed left ventricular dysfunction, suggesting TCM. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed a small infarction in the left anterior insular cortex. Eventually, his respiratory and cardiac functions gradually improved. He was finally discharged on his own from the hospital on postoperative day 9.
   CONCLUSIONS: We described a very rare case of TCM and NPE following CEA. The mechanisms of TCM and NPE involve excess catecholamine release after sympathetic nervous stimulation. Our findings suggest that surgery-associated transient ischemia and reperfusion injury to the left insular cortex stimulate sympathetic nerves.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcomes of bypass surgery for adult moyamoya and compare different surgical modalities by performing a comprehensive meta-analysis of relevant studies.
   METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed and articles regarding different treatments for adult patients with moyamoya were included. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to evaluate stroke recurrence, mortality, perioperative complications, and angiographic revascularization among different surgical methods and conservative treatment (CT).
   RESULTS: A total of 17 studies with 2224 adult patients with moyamoya were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with CT, surgical revascularization significantly decreased the future stroke events in the total population ([OR] 0.404; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.279-0.585; P < 0.001) and in the hemorrhagic-onset patients as well (OR 0.259; 95% CI 0.138-0.486; P < 0.001). However, for those patients with moyamoya and ischemia, there was no significant difference for future stroke events between the bypass and CT groups (OR 0.470; 95% CI 0.140-1.579; P = 0.222). Bypass also showed no mortality reduction compared with CT (OR 0.372; 95% CI 0.120-1.154; P = 0.087). For different surgical techniques, no differences for future stroke events, mortality, and perioperative complications were found between direct bypass and indirect bypass, whereas the degree of angiographic revascularization was better in the direct bypass group than in the indirect group (OR 4.720; 95% CI 1.222-18.230; P = 0.024).
   CONCLUSIONS: The bypass treatment was superior to conservative treatment in preventing recurrent stroke in adult patients with moyamoya, especially in those with a hemorrhagic onset. Direct bypass is associated with better revascularization results compared with indirect bypass.

   change of screws; Spinal instrumentation surgery; Stereolithography
ID FINITE-ELEMENT; PEDICLE SCREWS; REDUCTION; STRENGTH
AB OBJECTIVE: In thoracolumbar spinal instrumentation surgery, pedicle screw fixation is widely used, whereas screw loosening occurs only occasionally over time. It is common to evaluate screw loosening by the radiographic lucent zone around screws, which can neither evaluate loosening quantitatively nor detect slight screw loosening. In the present technical note, we describe a novel assessment technique of screw loosening by generating 3-dimensional screw images from computed tomography data and superposing them in time series.
   METHODS: Computed tomography data were exported in digital imaging and communications in medicine dataset and imported to the 3-dimensional computer-aided designing software, by which screws and rods were segmented and outputted in stereolithography (STL) format. The STL files were imported to the software, and registration based on iterative closest point algorithm was performed to assess screw position changes.
   RESULTS: Positional changes on STL in time series were classified into 3 types: 1) no position changes existed in the entire system of screws and rods; 2) position changes existed in the entire system of screws and rods, but no position changes were shown when the left-sided and right-sided screws and rod were separately evaluated; and 3) position changes existed in the left and/or right-sided screws and rods even when evaluated separately.
   CONCLUSIONS: This technique enables the quantitative evaluation of screw loosening and loosening between screws and rods. In conjunction with conventional methods of assessing radiographic lucent zone, we are able to obtain more accurate information regarding screw loosening after spinal instrumentation surgery.

ID PRIMARY INTRACRANIAL GERMINOMA; TUMOR
AB BACKGROUND: A few cases of spontaneous regression of germ cell tumors have been reported. Possible mechanisms include steroid medication, surgical intervention, diagnostic radiation exposure, and immune response. None of these hypotheses has been supported by sufficient data.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Two cases of germinoma demonstrated spontaneous regression before antitumor therapy. In the first case, a 19-year-old man presented with acute hydrocephalus due to a pineal mass and underwent emergent endoscopic third ventriculostomy. The pineal tumor started to regress on the 4th postoperative day after endoscopic third ventriculostomy. In the second case, a 22-year-old man presented with acute hydrocephalus and panhypopituitarism due to a suprasellar mass and underwent emergent external ventricular drainage, biopsy, and septostomy on the day of admission. Apparent regression of the tumor was discovered on the 5th day after initial surgery. Pathologic diagnosis was pure germinoma in both cases. Remarkable accumulations of CD4-positive lymphocytes and some apoptotic cells positive for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling staining were detected in both cases. Diagnostic radiation exposure is the only common condition in all reported cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: This unusual phenomenon of spontaneous regression of germinoma may be caused by a combination of pathognomonic characteristics of anatomic location with paraventricular development and stress induction as a trigger, such as salvage surgery or diagnostic radiation, including at extremely low dosage.

TI Adult Parasellar Capillary Hemangioma with Intrasellar Extension
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Capillary hemangioma; Parasellar; Pituitary; Sella
ID CAVERNOUS SINUS; STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY; HEAD
AB BACKGROUND: Capillary hemangiomata are benign vascular tumors that typically occur in children. They rarely occur in the central nervous system. Intracranial capillary hemangiomata in adults are very rare entities with only 18 cases reported in the literature. We report a case of parasellar capillary hemangiomata that extended into the sella in a 64-year-old woman as well as a review of the literature in adults.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a 64-year-old patient who presented with a headache, left-sided paresthesia, and weakness. Initial computed tomography of her brain showed a left-sided 3 cm x 2.5 cm parasellar lesion with intrasellar extension and no mass effect. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a lesion that was homogenously hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, isointense with adjacent brain parenchyma on T1-weighted MRI, and which demonstrated enhancement after contrast administration. The patient initially underwent an endoscopic transsphenoidal biopsy, which was inconclusive, followed by a craniotomy, biopsy, and debulking. Histologic examination showed fibrous tissue containing numerous thin-walled and irregular vascular channels of varying sizes. There was a very mild associated inflammatory infiltrate, mainly formed of small mononuclear chronic inflammatory cells and occasional histiocytes. The histologic appearances were in keeping with capillary hemangiomata.
   CONCLUSIONS: Capillary hemangiomata related to the sella are very rare and can easily be misdiagnosed on imaging alone. The present case highlights capillary hemangiomata as an important, albeit rare, differential when considering a sellar or parasellar mass.

DT Article
DE Conus medullaris elongation; Monosomy 7q; Sacral agenesis; Trisomy 19q
ID TETHERED CORD SURGERY; TERMINAL DELETION; CHROMOSOME-7
AB BACKGROUND: Progression of scoliosis following completion of growth, and the combination of low mental retardation and the conspicuous sagittal clinical and radiographic abnormalities suggest a secondary genesis of the scoliosis according to a genetic aberration.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In the outpatient department, an 18-year-old woman presents with scoliosis and mild mental retardation. Radiography findings demonstrate a sacral agenesis and then consecutively performed magnetic resonance imaging on a conus depression. Because of the symptom constellation, a genetic syndrome was suspected. Genetic diagnostics revealed a trisomy 19q and monosomy 7q. Typically, deletions of the subtelomere 7q show a phenotype with growth retardation, facial anomalies, and intellectual deficit; trisomy of the subtelomere 19q shows growth retardation, atypical ears, short neck, and intellectual deficit with delayed development. The further clinical radiologic and neurologic examination showed no evidence of a tethered cord syndrome. The correction of scoliosis was performed under intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring without neurologic complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the presence of dysplastic sacral changes and accompanying elongated conus medullaris in patients with scoliosis, it is always necessary to think of rare chromosome aberrations and to initiate appropriate diagnostics before surgery. The intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring is strongly recommended, owing to a morphologically, and not fully-excludable, tethered cord syndrome.

TI Endovascular and Microsurgical Aneurysm Training in a Chicken Thigh and
   Leg Pulsatile Model
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Aneurysm; Chicken vascular anatomy; Education; Endovascular treatment;
   Microsurgical clipping; Microvascular anastomosis; Training
AB BACKGROUND: Neurovascular training models include animal models, synthetics, or computer simulation. In vivo models are expensive and require significant resources. Synthetic/computer models do not reflect the elasticity of fresh vessels. We describe an endovascular and microsurgical training model using a chicken thigh/leg.
   METHODS: A total of 20 chicken thigh/leg models were obtained. Angiography was used to understand the anatomy. Proximal cannulation with a 5-French catheter was achieved and connected to a hemostatic valve with a pump to simulate pulsatile flow. Aneurysms were created at the thigh-leg junction. For clipping training, 3 types of aneurysms were created to reproduce anatomy seen in middle cerebral, anterior communicating, and posterior communicating aneurysms.
   RESULTS: The average cost per specimen was $1.70 +/- $0.30. The diameter of the proximal femoral artery was 2.4 mm +/- 0.2 mm. The length from the proximal femoral artery to the aneurysm was 9.5 cm +/- 0.7 cm. Distal catheterization was successful in all cases (n = 6). Successful deployment of coils and a stent was achieved under fluoroscopic guidance. Gross oversizing of coils and other mistakes led to aneurysm rupture. Each examiner performed an exploration of the pulsatile aneurysm, application and reapplication of a variety of clips, and then the final inspection of branching vessels to confirm patency.
   CONCLUSIONS: The chicken thigh/leg model provides training opportunities in microsurgical suturing, endovascular techniques for aneurysm obliteration, and microsurgical reconstruction of aneurysms. It combines affordability, time efficiency, and reproducibility. Further studies measuring improvement in technical aneurysm management and comparison with other training models are warranted.

AB BACKGROUND: Even though surgical conditions account for as much as 32% of the global burden of disease, 5 billion people worldwide do not have access to timely, affordable surgical and anesthetic care. Access to surgical care is separated along socioeconomic divides, and these disparities are most pronounced in low-and middle-income countries, such as the Caribbean nation of Haiti, where the availability of specialty surgical services like neurosurgery are scant, or completely absent.
   METHODS: This paper provides a narrative account of current neurosurgery-related activity in Haiti, a nation whose social, political, and economic context is unique in the Americas.
   RESULTS: After some background information and a bibliometric analysis of recent research efforts, we provide brief biographical sketches of Haiti's local neurosurgical leaders and an overview of recent initiatives in Haitian neurosurgical capacity building.
   CONCLUSIONS: The paper concludes with recommendations to guide the international neurosurgery community in future contributions.

TI Interhypothalamic Adhesion as Cause of Aborted Third Ventriculostomy:
   Neuroradiologic and Neuroendoscopic Considerations in Pediatric Case
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Endoscopic third ventriculostomy; Interhypothalamic adhesions; MRI
AB BACKGROUND: Interhypothalamic adhesions (IHAs) are horizontally oriented parenchymal bands of tissue connecting the medial hypothalamic regions across the third ventricle. They can be assessed with high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) techniques.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report MR and neuroendoscopic features of IHA in a 3-year-old boy without symptoms referable to the hypothalamus. He presented with obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to posterior fossa tumor. An endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) was attempted but not performed because of the presence of a thick IHA, which prevented an approach to the floor of the third ventricle. During the procedure the patient also experienced supraventricular tachycardia. The procedure was aborted, and an external ventricular drainage was left in the ventricles until resolution of hydrocephalus after posterior fossa surgery. To the best of our knowledge, no study has previously described in detail endoscopic images of IHA.
   CONCLUSIONS: MR imaging allows one to preoperatively identify most anatomic anomalies of the ventricular system and the floor of the third ventricle. However, an IHA that may prevent an approach to the floor of the third ventricle due to his thickness may be missed. This can be recognized only on direct vision, underlining the importance of endoscopy in neurosurgery.

DT Article
DE Cyst formation; LITT; Long-term complications
ID GAMMA-KNIFE RADIOSURGERY; STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY; ABLATION; LESIONS
AB BACKGROUND: The majority of complications following (LITT) therapy occur in the early postoperative period, with few long-term complications being reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we present 2 cases of delayed-onset cyst formation occurring more than 1 year following ablation, a previously unreported complication. In the first case, a 59-year-old female who previously underwent LITT for a radiation-induced cavernoma developed a 2-cm cystic lesion 18 months after ablation, resulting in recurrent seizures. In the second case, a 53-year-old female with a recurrent left frontal cerebral metastasis developed a large cystic lesion 30 months post ablation. Both patients required craniotomies and resection of their cystic lesions. In both cases pathology demonstrated reactive gliosis and blood vessel sclerosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize chronic gliosis following LITT therapy results in blood vessel sclerosis leading to blood-brain barrier-breakdown and delayed cyst formation. These findings support the need for long-term surveillance of patients treated with LITT.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Arachnoid cyst; Endoscopic third ventriculostomy; Flexible endoscopy;
   Fourth ventricle
ID 4TH VENTRICLE
AB BACKGROUND: Arachnoid cysts are common anomalies in the intracranial region. However, an intraventricular arachnoid cyst is rare, and occurrence within the fourth ventricle is especially uncommon; only 16 cases have been described in the literature. Arachnoid cysts in the fourth ventricle may cause obstructive hydrocephalus or cerebellar ataxia or cranial nerve palsy. Treatment of a fourth ventricular arachnoid cyst is complete or partial resection via a midline suboccipital approach. Recently, endoscopic fenestration has become the procedure of choice in the treatment of arachnoid cysts in supratentorial locations, but as yet there has been no report of treating a fourth ventricle arachnoid cyst using a flexible endoscope.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a 43-year-old man who suffered a recurrence of an arachnoid cyst in the fourth ventricle that had been partially excised 8 years previously using midline suboccipital craniectomy. Because of concerns of adhesions following the previous craniectomy, we decided to perform endoscopic treatment via the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle.
   CONCLUSIONS: As per our knowledge, this is the first case reporting the treatment of an arachnoid cyst of the fourth ventricle using a flexible endoscope via the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle. This method can be used to treat arachnoid cysts of the fourth ventricle.

AB BACKGROUND: Primary leptomeningeal melanocytic tumors of the central nervous system are rare and, especially in the spine, less frequent compared with other entities. There is no consensus regarding the best care of these tumors.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report 2 cases of primary leptomeningeal melanocytic tumors, 1 primary leptomeningeal melanoma (PLM) and 1 primary leptomeningeal melanocytoma (PLMC) of the upper cervical spine, and emphasize different surgical findings and clinical courses of these patients. A review of the literature according to primary leptomeningeal melanocytic tumors of the spine was done, especially to compare different treatment modalities in the younger history.
   CONCLUSIONS: Primary melanocytic tumors of the spine are exceedingly rare. Before surgery it is difficult to make a correct diagnosis. Usually an unexpected intraoperative finding with consecutive histopathologic analyses leads to the final diagnosis. An accurate search for melanocytic tumors outside the central nervous system as a primary source is mandatory. PLMC has a better prognosis than PLM. There is no consensus regarding the adjuvant therapy, but patients with PLM should be given radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapeutic approaches as immune checkpoint blockade after surgery. Communicating hydrocephalus is highly associated with PLM, but may occur in PLMC as well.

AB Control of bleeding in the confined area of the skull is imperative for successful neurosurgery and the prevention of devastating complications such as postoperative hemorrhage. This paper reviews the historical evolution of methods to achieve successful hemostasis in neurosurgery from the early 1800s to today. The major categories of hemostatic agents (mechanical, chemical, and thermal) are delineated and discussed in chronologic order. The significance of this article is in its detailed history of the kinds of hemostatic methods that have evolved with our accumulating medical and surgical knowledge, which may inform future innovations and improvements.

ID ARACHNOID CYSTS; CEREBELLOPONTINE ANGLE; GLIOEPENDYMAL CYST;

AB BACKGROUND: Neuroglial cysts are rare intracranial lesions that are believed to originate from the sequestration of neural tube lining during embryogenesis. They can present anywhere within the neuraxis; however, their most common location is the frontal lobe. Cerebellopontine angle (CPA) neuroglial cysts are extremely rare and, to the best of our knowledge, there are no previous reports of a neuroglial cyst arising from cranial nerves.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The current study presented a male adolescent with the reoccurrence of an intracranial cyst with symptoms of diplopia and facial numbness primarily treated as CPA arachnoid cyst with fenestration of the cyst 12 months prior to admission to our center. Different magnetic resonance imaging sequences showed a thin-walled extra-axial cyst at the right CPA without gadolinium enhancement. Direct visualization of the lesion revealed a cyst arising from the fifth cranial nerve sheath compressing the surrounding structures. The cyst was fenestrated, and a biopsy was taken from the cyst wall. The pathological analysis, along with specified histological markers, indicated the neuroglial nature of the cyst.
   CONCLUSIONS: The rising of a neuroglial cyst from the nerve sheath is a finding that brings other possible origins of neuroglial cysts into consideration.

DT Review
DE Corpus callosum; Germinoma; Unspecified eating disorder
ID GERM-CELL TUMORS; MRI
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial germ cell tumors are a rare group of neoplasms constituting 1% to 2% of primary intracranial tumors in North America and Europe. Germinomas of the corpus callosum are exceedingly rare, accounting for only 0.7% of all intracranial germ cell tumors.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of germinoma in the corpus callosum of a 17-year-old woman with a 2-year history of personality change, anorexia, amnesia, hypersomnia, and depression. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a well-circumscribed, heterogeneous mass measuring 2.9 x 5 x 3.1 cm, with multiple cystic areas and heterogeneous enhancement with gadolinium. It arose in the corpus callosum and extended to the fornix and frontal lobes. There was mild perilesional edema but no evidence of hypothalamus or hippocampus involvement. No spinal drop metastases were visualized on magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebrospinal fluid and serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, carcinoembryonic antigen, and placental alkaline phosphatase were all normal. Immunohistologic staining of tumor cells was positive for OCT3/4, placental alkaline phosphatase, and CD117 and negative for CD30 and GPC3. Radiotherapy led to a substantial decrease in tumor size.
   CONCLUSION: This is a case of germinoma arising in the corpus callosum that presented clinically with an eating disorder manifested as restrictive anorexia.

TI Suprasellar Colloid Cyst over 11-Year Follow-up: Case Report and
   Literature Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Colloid cyst; Growth analysis; Suprasellar cystic lesion
ID SELLAR REGION; NEURENTERIC CYST; IMAGING FINDINGS; CLEFT CYST
AB BACKGROUND: Colloid cysts (CCs) are rare cystic lesions derived from the endoderm of the central nervous system. Although they appear most commonly in the anterior roof of the third ventricle, there are only a few reports of CCs located in the suprasellar region. Although CCs are considered to be slow-growing benign tumors, their developmental process remains unclear.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 6-year-old boy was referred to our hospital for a mild head injury. Head computed tomography scan revealed a round, hyperdense suprasellar lesion, while magnetic resonance imaging depicted the mass as an isointense lesion with multiple highly hypointense spots on T2-weighted imaging. Although this lesion had been managed conservatively with annual magnetic resonance imaging follow-up, its size gradually increased, resulting in an increase in diameter by a factor of 1.5 over an 11-year period. The doubling time of this tumor was estimated to be approximately 7 years. Despite its asymptomatic nature, the cystic lesion was totally resected when the patient was 17 years of age using an endoscopic endonasal approach to make a definitive histologic diagnosis and prevent the occurrence of neurologic symptoms. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the histologic diagnosis of the surgical specimen was consistent with CC.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that CC may be one of several possible diagnoses in patients who present with suprasellar cystic lesions. Even if CCs in the suprasellar region remain asymptomatic, radiological follow-up is required due to possible progressive enlargement of the cyst.

AB BACKGROUND: The presence of a caroticoclinoid bar (CCB) has been implicated in both transcranial and endonasal surgery. Its morphology reflects differences in the microsurgical anatomy of the parasellar area and its manipulation during anterior or middle clinoidectomy can result in internal carotid artery injury. Although adjustment of the surgical technique according to the CCB anatomic variants is required for safe surgical access to the paraclinoid region, a review indicated the lack of a systematic assortment of reported data regarding the prevalence of the CCB. Thus, our objective was to systematically review and document the prevalence of the CCB and its anatomic variations.
   METHODS: Three databases were systematically reviewed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement through August 2018 to identify relevant studies.
   RESULTS: A total of 27 reports (7521 subjects or specimens, 14,449 sides) were included in the present meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of the CCB was 32.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 26.6%-38.8%) when measured in the subjects or specimens and 23.6% (95% CI, 19.7%-27.6%) when measured in each side. The overall prevalence of the CCB reported from imaging studies was 23.1% (95% CI, 8.9%-41.4%) for the subjects/specimens and 18.7% (95% CI, 12.6%-25.7%) for each side. The presence of the CCB was slightly more prevalent (P = 0.050) on the right side.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed a considerable prevalence of the CCB, with lower prevalence rates found among imaging studies. Although meticulous preoperative investigation is mandatory, surgeons treating patients with parasellar pathologic entities should always be vigilant regarding the CCB.

AB BACKGROUND: Super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) is a life-threatening neurologic emergency defined as "status epilepticus (SE) that continues 24 hours or more after the onset of anesthesia, including those cases in which the SE recurs on the reduction or withdrawal of anesthesia," which occurs in 10% to 15% of patients with SE and rarely has been resolved surgically.
   CASE DESCRIPTIONS: A 20-year-old man with SRSE and a long history of left parieto-occipital oligoastrocytoma was admitted for convulsive SE that became SRSE and underwent lesionectomy guided by electrocorticography and neuronavigation for local tumor recurrence. Histopathologic diagnosis was oligoastrocytoma. SRSE was aborted and the patient recovered fully without any functional deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: The lesionectomy guided by electrocorticography and neuronavigation should be considered as a treatment option for patients with SRSE.

AB BACKGROUND: This original report describes the outcome of a cranioplasty at long-term follow-up. A large calvarial bone defect of a child was reconstructed with a bioactive and biostable nonmetallic implant.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In a child with infantile fibrosarcoma of occipital bone, the malignancy was removed at 2.5 years of age, and the defect site was reconstructed with an onlay glass fiber-reinforced composite-bioactive glass implant. The follow-up examination at 5 years 7 months showed no signs of tumor recurrence. During the follow-up period, the contour of the reconstructed area followed skull anatomic development. Computed tomography demonstrated considerably large areas (approximately 70% of the total area) of bone ongrowth to the peridural surface of the implant.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the future, a synthetic cranioplasty material that is able to integrate with cranial bone may be considered superior to cryopreserved bone grafts in younger age groups.

AB BACKGROUND: Machine learning (ML) is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that gives computer systems the ability to learn data, without being explicitly programmed. Currently, ML has been successfully used for optical character recognition, spam filtering, and face recognition. The aim of the present study was to review the current applications of ML in the field of neuro-oncology.
   METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review using the PubMed and Cochrane databases using a keyword search for January 30, 2000 to March 31, 2018. The data were clustered for neuro-oncology scope of ML into 3 categories: patient outcome predictors, imaging analysis, and gene expression.
   RESULTS: Data from 5346 patients in 29 studies were used to develop ML-based algorithms (MLBAs) in neuro-oncology. MLBAs were used to predict the outcomes for 2483 patients, with a sensitivity range of 78%-98% and specificity range of 76%-95%. In all studies, the MLBAs had greater accuracy than the conventional ones. MLBAs for image analysis showed accuracy in diagnosing low-grade versus high-grade gliomas, ranging from 80% to 93% and 90% for diagnosing high-grade glioma versus lymphoma. Seven studies used MLBAs to analyze gene expression in neuro-oncology.
   CONCLUSIONS: MLBAs in neuro-oncology have been shown to predict patients' outcomes more accurately than conventional parameters in a retrospective analysis. If their high diagnostic accuracy in imaging analysis and detection of somatic mutations are corroborated in prospective studies, the use of tissue diagnosis or liquid biopsy might be curtailed. Finally, MLBAs are promising to help guide targeted therapy, can lead to personalized medicine, and open areas of study in the cancer cellular signaling system, not otherwise known.

AB BACKGROUND: Secondary brain injuries, such as delayed cerebral infarction (DCI), are the leading causes of disability after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Detecting DCI may be challenging, especially for patients presenting an altered level of consciousness.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe herein the case of a patient who developed acute hemiplegia 4 days after SAH, with raised blood flow velocities on transcranial Doppler, compatible with vasospasm. Finally, full work-up, using computed tomography (CT) scan with perfusion CT and continuous electroencephalography, was consistent with nonconvulsive seizures.
   CONCLUSIONS: Multiple secondary complications (DCI, seizures, hydrocephalus) may occur after SAH but are clinically difficult to diagnose. A multimodal evaluation (transcranial Doppler, CT or magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography) is useful in order to detect and treat late complications.

ID MAGNETIC-FIELD INTERACTIONS; ARTIFACTS
AB BACKGROUND: Neurooncologic patients frequently require surgery, and neurosurgical devices are often implanted during neurosurgery. These devices could disturb oncologic follow-up by magnetic resonance imaging.
   METHODS: The authors describe the use of neurosurgical devices, such as bone substitutes, ventriculoperitoneal shunts, and titanium skull fixations, in neurooncologic patients.
   RESULTS: Acrylic cement cranioplasty, valve of ventriculoperitoneal shunt, and titanium skull fixations produced magnetic artifacts disturbing postoperative magnetic resonance imaging.
   CONCLUSIONS: The authors highlight the fact that all these neurosurgical devices implanted during surgery should be carefully evaluated to allow appropriate imaging follow-up for neurooncologic patients, which is a problem that remains underreported in the literature.

AB BACKGROUND: The criterion standard for the treatment of newly diagnosed primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) remains high-dose chemotherapy in conjunction with palliative whole-brain radiotherapy; however, there may be a role for novel combined approaches in immunocompromised patients.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 66-year-old man presented with acute cephalalgia, disorientation, and lethargy. His condition was evaluated in the emergency department, and he was admitted with probable hydrocephalus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed multiple nonspecific brain lesions, predominantly involving the right temporal lobe, which on biopsy led to a diagnosis of PCNSL. Subsequent laboratory studies demonstrated active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, with a CD4 count of 21 cells/mu L and an HIV viral load (VL) of >400,000 copies/mL. The patient was eventually given highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). He declined palliative whole-brain radiotherapy but was amenable to gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for treatment of the right temporal brain lesions. Three months later, the patient's neurologic symptoms had improved; similarly, his CD4 count increased to 176 cells/mL, and his HIV viral load was <90 copies/mL. By the 12-month follow-up visit, the patient was asymptomatic, and at 36 months, MRI of the brain demonstrated total remission without new brain lesions.
   CONCLUSIONS: The criterion standard for treatment of newly diagnosed PCNSL remains high-dose chemotherapy in conjunction with palliative whole-brain radiotherapy; however, there may be a role for novel combined approaches using chemotherapy, HAART, and GKRS to have a positive impact on survival rates of PCNSL related to AIDS.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Intracranial aneurysm; Moyamoya disease; Persistent primitive trigeminal
   artery; Subarachnoid hemorrhage
AB BACKGROUND: Persistent primitive trigeminal artery (PPTA) is a rare abnormal carotid-basilar anastomosis. In rare circumstances, PPTA can be associated with some cerebrovascular anomalies, including arteriovenous malformation, intracranial aneurysm, carotid cavernous fistula, and moyamoya disease (MMD).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In this report, we present an extremely rare case with simultaneous occurrence of PPTA, MMD, and multiple intracranial aneurysms. The patient was admitted for subarachnoid hemorrhage. Endovascular coiling of the multiple aneurysms was successfully performed. The patient experienced an uneventful recovery, and no recurrence of the intracranial aneurysms was noted during the 1-year follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenesis of the coexistence of PPTA and MMD, PPTA and intracranial aneurysm, and MMD and intracranial aneurysm is still unknown. According to the literature, congenital factor and hemodynamic stress may play an important role in the formation of these vascular anomalies. In case of hypoplasia of the vertebrobasilar system, PPTA could also be used as a route for endovascular coiling for some specific aneurysms in the posterior circulation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such a case.

TI Apatinib (YN968D1) and Temozolomide in Recurrent Invasive Pituitary
   Adenoma: Case Report and Literature Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Review

   adenomas; Temozolomide
ID ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH-FACTOR; THERAPY; VEGF
AB BACKGROUND: Invasive pituitary adenomas often recurred after postoperative radiotherapy and are difficult to treat. Temozolomide is an alkylating cytostaticum and has been reported to reduce pituitary tumor size and hormone hypersecretion. However, this is far from enough. Pituitary adenomas have relatively high expression of vascular endothelial growth factor. Therefore an antiangiogenic agent has been used in a small number of aggressive or malignant pituitary tumors after recurrence. Apatinib (YN968D1) is a small-molecule antiangiogenic agent that selectively inhibits VEGFR-2 and also mildly inhibits c-Kit and c-Src tyrosine kinases, abundant in invasive pituitary adenomas.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a 41-year-old female with a growth hormone (GH)-secreting invasive pituitary adenoma causing menstrual disorder and headache symptoms. Over 3 years, she underwent 4 surgeries and a stereotactic radiosurgery, but the results were poor. Two months after the fourth operation, she started treatment with temozolomide (200 mg/m(2), days 1-5, 28 days, orally) and apatinib (0.425 g, daily, orally). Her GH level dropped to normal with a >90% decrease in tumor size, after 1-year treatment. There was no evidence of recurrence by imaging or by serum GH levels over 31.5 months of follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: We successfully treated this patient with recurrent invasive pituitary adenoma with temozolomide and apatinib for 31.5 months without recurrence. Angiogenesis is an active process in the cases of invasive pituitary adenomas that cannot be controlled by conventional therapy.

TI A Case of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome After Surgical
   Clipping of Unruptured Cerebral Aneurysm
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Clipping; General anesthesia; PRES; Unruptured cerebral aneurysm
ID VASOSPASM; THERAPY; COMPLICATION; PERFUSION
AB BACKGROUND: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is characterized by reversible edematous lesions on imaging examinations, along with symptoms of altered consciousness disorder and seizures. Various factors associated with PRES have been reported. However, we encountered a very rare case that developed after clipping surgery for unruptured cerebral aneurysm.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 74-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented with an unruptured right middle cerebral artery aneurysm and underwent cranial clipping surgery. After surgery, he developed consciousness disorder and epilepsy after delayed awakening from general anesthesia. Radiological examinations revealed multiple edematous lesions, strongly suggesting PRES, and excluding asymmetry consistent with the area of craniotomy. With conservative treatment, symptoms and radiological findings almost disappeared. Symptoms and imaging findings remaining at the area of craniotomy were attributed to the severe difference in cerebral perfusion pressure due to craniotomy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on the literature, this case was considered to represent PRES caused by rapid blood pressure fluctuations accompanying general anesthesia for clipping surgery. Practitioners must keep PRES in mind as a rare complication after clipping for unruptured cerebral aneurysms. PRES developing after craniotomy shows unilaterality and may become severe in the craniotomy area and leave sequelae.

DT Article
DE Daptomycin; Infant; Shunt infection
ID CASE SERIES; CHILDREN; VENTRICULITIS; MENINGITIS; FAECALIS
AB BACKGROUND: The rate of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt infection is reported between 3% and 20%. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are increasingly prevalent nosocomial pathogens worldwide, and they rarely cause infections to the central nervous system. Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide effective antibiotic because of its rapid bactericidal effect. It is a life-saving treatment option for meningitis, bacteremia, sepsis, endocarditis, and urinary system infections caused by VRE.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here, we present a 2.5-month-old infant boy with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. This is the first report of a pediatric VP shunt infection caused by VRE and treated with a combination of intravenous (IV) linezolid IV and intraventricular (IVT) daptomycin.
   CONCLUSION: The patient was admitted to the medical center with umbilical discharge, and shunt revision was applied with the thought of shunt dysfunction. Intermittent umbilical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage continued, and the patient experienced a fever 2 weeks after the operation. VRE growth in his CSF culture was treated by meropenem and linezolid. Upon continuation of the growth afterwards, the patient was referred to our hospital and underwent extraventricular drainage, and IV linezolid, IV daptomycin (8 mg/kg per day), and IVT daptomycin (2.5 mg/kg per day) was scheduled as treatment. On the fifth day of treatment, there was no growth in the culture, and no side effects were observed during the treatment. A VP shunt was placed in the patient for the 15 days of IV daptomycin plus IVT treatment, and 36 days of linezolid. No infection was observed in the 8-month follow-up period.

   SPONDYLOLYSIS
AB OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: High-grade spondylolisthesis (HGS) is a complex clinical problem that poses significant challenges to the treating physician. Contentious debate has continued regarding the most optimal surgical approach for these patients. A variety of transsacral and transvertebral techniques have been described in reported studies.
   METHODS AND RESULTS: We present 2 cases of low back pain and radicular symptoms. Our 2 patients were a 35-year-old woman and a 26-year-old white woman. The computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed progressive HGS (grade III) that had not been relieved by conservative measures. Both patients underwent transsacral fixation using the reverse Bohlman technique (RBT) at L5-S1 and L4-L5 anterior lumbar interbody fusion combined with posterolateral fusion. At the 9- and 10-month follow-up visits, the patients reported minimal back pain with no radicular symptoms, and the imaging studies showed satisfactory fusion in both patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate the utility of the sacroiliac joint fusion cage using RBT in patients with HGS with successful clinical outcome. The RBT is safe, feasible, and effective in carefully selected patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of the novel femoral-long sheath-reshape-anchoring-stenting (FLRAS) technique for venous sinus stenting in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
   METHODS: In a retrospective, single-center study, we comparatively analyzed clinical and imaging data from consecutive patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension who underwent venous sinus stenting using either traditional technique from June 2013 to May 2015 or FLRAS technique from May 2015 to May 2018.
   RESULTS: The study enrolled 20 patients (mean age 36.7 years; range, 17-50 years; 15 women). In the FLRAS group (n = 12) versus traditional stenting group (n = 8), mean procedure duration was significantly shorter (48.3 minutes vs. 92.5 minutes, P < 0.001), and procedure success rate was higher (100% vs. 87.5%, P > 0.05), with no complications versus 2 complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Use of FLRAS technique for venous sinus stenting in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension appeared to yield favorable outcomes relative to use of traditional stenting technique. A large, multi-center, randomized study is warranted to confirm these findings.

ID LUMBAR FUSION; MOTION; PAIN
AB BACKGROUND: The Sextant percutaneous pedicle screw fixation system is a commonly used technique. In this system, the pedicle screw and the sharp rod are placed through stab incisions. The unique mechanism of action of this system may cause unprecedented adverse effects, such as iatrogenic sacroiliac (SI) joint syndrome.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A patient presented with iatrogenic SI joint syndrome caused by the rod of the Sextant system at the L4-L6 level causing ilium irritation and dynamic SI joint instability. The patient was treated with an endoscopy-based technique. This is the first report of endoscopic treatment for iatrogenic SI joint syndrome as an adverse effect resulting from use of the Sextant system.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons need to be aware of iatrogenic SI joint syndrome using the Sextant system when performing percutaneous pedicle screw fixation. An endoscopy-based technique may be an effective alternative to conventional corrective surgery when treating iatrogenic SI joint syndrome using the Sextant system.

ID DISC ARTHROPLASTY; FORAMINOTOMY; DISKECTOMY; OUTCOMES
AB OBJECTIVE: Cervical stenosis with myelopathy caused by ossification of the ligamentum flavum is relatively rare. Surgical treatment is the preferred option. Previous surgical procedures usually require assisted internal fixation, and some problems may occur, such as large trauma, intraoperative bleeding, wound infection, and internal fixation failure. The aim of this paper is to introduce a new minimally invasive surgical procedure for the treatment of upper cervical spinal stenosis complicated with myelopathy.
   METHODS: A 56-year-old man with cervical myelopathy (C2-3) caused by calcification of the ligamentum flavum underwent posterior percutaneous full-endoscopic cervical laminectomy and decompression (PECLD) and achieved good clinical efficacy.
   RESULTS: A surgical incision just 1 cm in size was made, and there was little bleeding during the operation. The patient was hospitalized for 2 days and returned to work after 4 weeks. The patient's postoperative recovery of neurologic function was significantly improved, pain was obviously reduced, and quality of life was remarkably improved. No intra- or postoperative surgical complications were encountered.
   CONCLUSIONS: PECLD is an effective method for treating cervical stenosis associated with myelopathy because of ossification of the ligamentum flavum. It has the advantages of smaller trauma, less bleeding, shorter postoperative hospital stay, and faster recovery. Taken together, this minimally technique can be considered as a good alternative to traditional open surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: Cystic acoustic neuromas typically present with more rapid growth and shorter symptomatic periods when compared with solid tumors.
   CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 70-year-old man unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, frequent falls, and worsening ataxia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed a 33.9-cm(3) cystic acoustic neuroma with mass effect on the brainstem and cerebellum. Subsequent MRI scans revealed tumor measurements of 38.2 cm(3), 37.6 cm(3), 23.8 cm(3), and 14.3 cm(3) at 3, 6, 9, and 15 months after initial presentation, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous tumor regression was accompanied with reduced mass effect on neighboring structures and improved symptoms. Owing to their unpredictable growth patterns, early surgical resection has been recommended for cystic acoustic neuromas. However, this patient experienced spontaneous tumor involution after conservative management. Further research on the growth patterns of cystic schwannomas is imperative for them proper counseling of patients and improvement of treatment strategies.

AB BACKGROUND: Mechanical thrombectomy is an effective treatment of acute large vessel occlusion. However, when difficult anatomy is encountered in which the reperfusion catheter cannot be positioned well, the outcomes can be suboptimal. We present a patient with right common carotid artery (CCA) and internal carotid artery occlusion after repair of an acute type A aortic dissection. Successful mechanical thrombectomy and stenting through direct neck exposure and puncture was performed.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-year-old man with a type A aortic dissection presented with sudden onset of neck pain and cold sweating. Aortic valve resuspension, proximal anastomosis of ascending aortic graft, partial aortic arch graft replacement, and innominate artery reimplantation was performed. After aortic surgery, left limb weakness was noted in the intensive care unit. Computed tomography angiography of the brain showed right CCA occlusion up to the internal carotid artery. The right CCA was exposed and directly punctured. A thrombus was successfully removed, and 5 stents were deployed to treat the internal carotid artery and CCA dissection. Angiography showed a final Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction 3 result, and the patient had an excellent clinical recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Acute mechanical thrombectomy through open direct neck puncture to treat an acute type A aortic dissection and concurrent CCA dissection and occlusion is an effective and optimal method.

TI Spontaneous Hemorrhage Followed by Paraparesis in a Patient with a
   Spinal Meningioma
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Paraparesis; Spinal meningioma; Tumor hemorrhage
ID SUBDURAL-HEMATOMA
AB BACKGROUND: Although rare, spinal meningiomas may cause motor and sensory deficits or difficulty with bladder or bowel function due to spinal cord compression. Although hemorrhage of intracranial meningiomas is well documented, there are very few cases of hemorrhage or hematoma associated with spinal meningiomas in the literature. Spinal meningiomas have been reported to be associated with subdural, epidural, intratumoral, and subarachnoid hemorrhage, and usually in the setting of an inciting event such as lumbar puncture or anticoagulation therapy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 68-year-old women presented to the emergency room with acute onset of paraparesis in the lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging findings were inconclusive for cause but showed spinal cord compression. Intraoperative findings demonstrated an intratumoral hemorrhage and pathology was consistent with meningioma.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in English literature of a patient who first develops symptoms from a spinal meningioma with spontaneous intratumoral hemorrhage presenting with acute paraparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging findings in retrospect match surgical intraoperative findings. Prompt surgical intervention can result in complete resolution of neurologic deficits.

TI Bilateral Brachial Plexus Injury After MiraDry Procedure for Axillary
   Hyperhidrosis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Axillary hyperhidrosis; Bilateral brachia plexus injury; MiraDry
ID MICROWAVE DEVICE; CLINICAL-EVALUATION
AB BACKGROUND: Multiple treatments are available for primary axillary hyperhidrosis including noninvasive, microwave-based thermal treatments designed to destroy sweat glands in the axilla. Often these procedures involve local anesthetic injection to the axilla, followed by placement of the microwave emitter onto the skin and applying the heat treatment to varying depths of the subcutaneous tissues.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 49-year-old, thin, active woman (body mass index 19.6) underwent microwave-based treatment to the bilateral axillary regions. She experienced an electric sensation into the ulnar digits of the right hand during anesthetic injection and then underwent the microwave thermal treatment. She suffered a bilateral brachial plexus injury with imaging evidence of severe, subcutaneous edema surrounding the nerves of the plexus in the axilla, as well as denervation atrophy of the arm and forearm muscles bilaterally. At the time of evaluation and electromyography, 8 months after treatment, she had recovered significant strength in the left upper extremity but continued to have evidence of a severe radial nerve injury on the right. Electromyography demonstrated some recovery, and observation was recommended followed by secondary reconstruction if required. It is likely that the patient sustained thermal injury to the nerves in the axilla bilaterally, given the close proximity to the skin surface in a patient with a low body mass index.
   CONCLUSIONS: In thin patients undergoing treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, consideration should be given to the distal brachial plexus, which may be at risk of damage with high-powered microwave-based therapy.

TI Acute Development and Rupture of a Basilar Tip Mycotic Aneurysm
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Aneurysm rupture; Digital subtraction angiography; Infective
   endocarditis; Mycotic aneurysm
AB BACKGROUND: Infectious intracranial aneurysms are rare but encountered when associated with rupture or detected on screening of high-risk patients. The time course of the development of these aneurysms is unknown. Ultimately, the data published on mycotic aneurysms are in the form of case series, retrospective studies, with one recent systematic review, all of which have difficulty defining specifics regarding aneurysmal formation in these patients. We present a case that may help define the time frame of mycotic aneurysm growth.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A patient with endocarditis, first identified to have a distal middle cerebral artery aneurysm treated with Onyx embolization, and an otherwise-unremarkable cerebral angiogram experienced significant subarachnoid hemorrhage 5 days later. Within that short time frame on appropriate antibiotic therapy, she developed and ruptured a basilar tip aneurysm, which was subsequently treated with coil embolization.
   CONCLSUSIONS: The time course of infectious intracranial aneurysm development is not known and difficult to define. This case illustrates an example of the development of a new infectious intracranial aneurysm and subsequent rupture over the course of 5 days, showing that these types of aneurysms and subsequent neurologic sequelae can happen acutely.

TI Neurooncology Research in Nigeria: Great Untapped Potential
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Academic; Africa; Brain tumor; Neuro-oncology; Nigeria; Publications;
   Scholarship
ID CHALLENGES; CARE
AB BACKGROUND: Nigeria has the largest population in Africa and has suboptimal access to neurooncology care. It has been estimated that there is approximately 1 neurosurgeon for every 2.4 million people in the country, with only few of these trained in the neurooncology subspecialty and no dedicated medical or radiation neurooncologists. There is a paucity of information on the field of neurooncology in Nigeria. This manuscript aims to provide an overview of the current state of neurooncology literature in Nigeria.
   METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed, using Google Scholar, PubMed, and African Journals Online, to search for articles related to neurooncology in Nigeria, from 1963-2018. Articles were reviewed and categorized.
   RESULTS: Sixty-three relevant articles were identified. They comprised original research in basic science (N = 1), clinical science (N = 59), and reviews (N = 3). Retrospective case series were the most common type of publication. Categorizing according to histology, articles focused on meningioma (N = 12), pituitary tumors (N = 10), glioma (N = 7), central nervous system metastases (N = 6), multiple histologic types (N = 25), and other types of tumors (N = 3). Eight pediatric neurooncology publications were among these. Two manuscripts, focusing on surgical subjects, specifically addressed issues on neurooncology clinical practice in Nigeria. Of the total manuscripts, 26 were published in Nigerian-based journals and 37 in journals outside Nigeria. The majority of the journals were low-impact factor journals. An increasing number of publications over time was noted.
   CONCLUSIONS: There is a small but growing amount of scholarly literature on neurooncology from Nigeria. However, there continues to be room for growth in neurooncology research output. With Nigeria's large patient population, there is potential to learn and add to the academic literature. Although there are logistical obstacles to both patient care and research in neurooncology in Nigeria, there is promise for favorable advancement.

TI The Effect of Mannitol in the Early Stage of Supratentorial Hypertensive
   Intracerebral Hemorrhage: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage; Mannitol; Meta-analysis
ID HEMATOMA ENLARGEMENT; STROKE
AB BACKGROUND: Mannitol has been widely applied as a priority drug in the clinical treatment for brain edema and increased intracranial pressure after intracerebral hemorrhage. However, no consensus on the efficacy and safety of mannitol has been achieved. Our meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effect of mannitol in the early stage of supratentorial hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (HICH) and provided a treatment reference for clinicians.
   METHODS: All relevant studies on mannitol treatment of supratentorial HICH were identified from the databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, VIP, CNKI, and Wan Fang. Our outcome measures included the incidence of hematoma enlargement, the neurologic function improvement rate, mortality, and the incidence of aggravated brain edema. The subgroup analysis was performed to explore the impact of study type, year of publication, intervention time, and dose on the outcome measures. Publication bias was assessed by the funnel plot.
   RESULTS: Thirty-four studies consisting of 3627 patients with supratentorial HICH were included in this study (from 2000 to 2018). Significant statistical difference was found between the mannitol and nonmannitol group in terms of all the outcome measures, including the incidence of hematoma enlargement (P < 0.00001), the neurologic function improvement rate (P < 0.00001), mortality (P < 0.00001), and the incidence of aggravated cerebral edema (P = 0.0002). In subgroup analysis, the results showed that study type and intervention time did not significantly affect the outcome measures. No significant statistical difference was found in the subgroups of publication time (after 2010) (P = 0.08) and half-dose of mannitol (P = 0.20) on mortality. In addition, the further analysis showed that whatever the dose (250 mL or 125 mL) and intervention time (<24, <12, or <6 hours), mannitol could lead to hematoma enlargement.
   CONCLUSIONS: For patients without obvious symptoms of intracranial hypertension or cerebral palsy, it is not recommended to use mannitol routinely in the early stage of supratentorial HICH. More high-quality trials should be included to confirm our conclusion and to ascertain the best time and dose of mannitol to use.

   EVENTS; MALIGNANT PROGRESSION; PEPTIDE VACCINATION; COMBINED NIVOLUMAB
AB BACKGROUND: The current standard of care for patients with high-grade gliomas includes surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiation; but even still most patients experience disease progression and succumb to their illness within a few years of diagnosis. Immunotherapy, which stimulates an anti-tumor immune response, has been revolutionary in the treatment of some hematologic and solid malignancies, generating substantial excitement for its potential for patients with glioblastoma. However, to date, the preclinical success of these approaches against high-grade glioma models has not been replicated in human clinical trials. Moreover, the complex response to these biologically active treatments can complicate management decisions, and the neurosurgical oncology community needs to be actively involved in and up to date on the use of these agents in patients with high-grade glioma. In this review, we discuss the challenges immunotherapy faces for high-grade gliomas, the completed and ongoing clinical trials for the major immunotherapies, and the nuances in management for patients being actively treated with one of these agents.
   METHODS: We reviewed the literature to summarize the current immunotherapy strategies for high-grade gliomas.
   RESULTS: Preclinical and clinical trials investigating dendritic cell and peptide vaccines, checkpoint inhibitors, and adoptive T cell therapy are highlighted in this review.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although immunotherapy has yet to fully fulfill its promise for patients with glioblastoma and improve patient outcomes, there is still excitement that these approaches will eventually lead to durable anti-tumor responses. As neurosurgeons, an understanding of the complex interactions between the standard of care therapies and the other medications used in the treatment arsenal for patients with high-grade brain tumors is crucial to the management of these patients.

She worked as a neurosurgeon at the Hadassah EinKarem Hospital in Jerusalem and subsequently established the first neurosurgical department at the Ramallah Governmental Hospital in Ramallah in 1986. Thereafter, she has continued a career in private practice, currently at Saint Luke's Hospital, Nablus. Dr. Kidess played a major part in establishing neurosurgery in Palestine. She was among the founders of the Palestinian Neurosurgical Society in 2014.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this article, we recount Dr. Kidess's contributions and achievements to neurosurgery in Palestine. Her commitment, persistence, and diligence enabled her to overcome great odds and become the first female neurosurgeon in Palestine. We hope that her story will inspire and open the doors for subsequent women to enter and enhance neurosurgery, especially in the Middle East.

TI Utility of Cervical Collars Following Cervical Fusion Surgery. Does It
   Improve Fusion Rates or Outcomes? A Systematic Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Anterior cervical; Cervical collar; Cervical fusion; Posterior cervical
ID DISKECTOMY; ORTHOSES
AB BACKGROUND: The use of postoperative cervical collars following cervical fusions is common practice. Its use has been purported to improve fusion rates and outcomes. There is a paucity in the strength of evidence to support its clinical benefit. Our objective is to critically evaluate the published literature to determine the strength of evidence supporting the use of postoperative cervical collar use following cervical fusions.
   METHODS: A systematic review using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (also known as PRISMA) was performed. An online search using Medline and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases was used to query prospective and retrospective clinical trials evaluating cervical fusions with or without postoperative collar.
   RESULTS: The search identified 894 articles in Medline and 65 articles in the Cochrane database. From these articles, 130 were selected based on procedure and collar use. Only 3 studies directly compared between collar use and no collar use. Our analysis of the mean improvement in neck disability index scores and improvement over time intervals did not show a statistically significant difference between collar versus no collar (P = 0.86).
   CONCLUSIONS: We found no strong evidence to support the use of cervical collars after 1- and 2-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion procedures, and no studies comparing collar use and no collar use after posterior cervical fusions. Given the cost and likely impact of collar use on driving and the return to work, our study shows that currently there is no proven benefit to routine use of postoperative cervical collar in patients undergoing 1- and 2-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion for degenerative cervical pathologies.

DT Article
DE Craniotomy; Dural arteriovenous fistula; Embolization; Therapeutic
ID SINUS; CLASSIFICATION
AB OBJECTIVE: Endovascular embolization of dural arteriovenous fistula may not be a feasible approach depending on the location and/or surrounding structures.
   METHODS: Combined embolization comprising endovascular embolization by direct puncture of the sinus after small craniotomy under fluoroscopic guidance is a good treatment option for lesions that cannot be treated by endovascular embolization alone.
   RESULTS: We presented 2 cases of dural arteriovenous fistula that could not be treated by endovascular embolization alone. Treatment included direct puncture of the sinus after small craniotomy to access and completely block the lesion.
   CONCLUSIONS: Combined techniques are required for the management of complex dural arteriovenous fistula. We report a treatment method that can be used for lesions that cannot be treated by endovascular embolization alone along with some technical pitfalls.

AB BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of stereotactic aspiration of necrotic brain tissue for treating malignant middle cerebral artery infarction (MMI) in patients older than 60 years of age.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A total of 13 consecutive patients with MMI (mean age, 67 +/- 6.62 years) were enrolled in the study. These patients were treated with stereotactic aspiration of necrotic brain tissue within 72 hours from stroke onset between January 2016 and June 2017. The surgical results and clinical outcomes were evaluated in response to stereotactic aspiration of necrotic brain tissue. The mean preoperative infarction volume in the patients was found to be 153.46 +/- 9.39 mL according to the latest computed tomography scan. The 30-day mortality was 2 out of 13 patients (15.4%). Patients were followed-up for 6 months to evaluate the efficacy of stereotactic aspiration of necrotic brain tissue using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Among the 11 surviving surgical patients, 6 (54.5%) had an mRS score of 3 (defined as moderate disability), 4 (36.4%) had an mRS score of 4 (defined as moderate to severe disability), and 1 (9.1%) had an mRS score of 5 (defined as severe disability). The probability of 6-month unfavorable outcome, defined as an mRS score of 5 or 6 (death), was 3 out of 13 (23.1%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the stereotactic aspiration of necrotic brain tissue is an effective and safe method in patients with MMI who are over 60 years of age.

TI Clinical Presentation and Pathologic Characteristics of Pituitary

   Literature

DT Review
DE Breast cancer; Hyperprolactinemia; Pituitary metastasis; Surgery;

ID CANCER METASTASIS; TUMORS; LESIONS; GLAND
AB BACKGROUND: It is rare for breast carcinoma to metastasize to the pituitary gland; this finding indicates extensive metastasis of the primary tumor.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Herein, we present a 57-year-old patient with pituitary gland metastasis from breast cancer that was treated with extensive radical mastectomy 16 years prior. The pituitary was the sole site of metastasis. The patient was admitted with the chief complaint of blurred vision for 1 year and episodic headaches for 1 month. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a solid mass in the sellar region with heterogenous contrast enhancement. The preoperative diagnosis was a pituitary adenoma. Neuroendoscopy-assisted tumor resection was conducted through a single-nostril sphenoid sinus approach. A pinkish-white, firm neoplasm was found, with an abundant blood supply and an indistinct boundary between the neoplasm and normal pituitary tissue; complete resection was achieved. The results of immunohistochemical analysis were positive for cytokeratin, Ki-67 antigen, estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and prolactin-induced protein. The neoplasm was negative for spalt-like transcription factor 4, mammaglobin, and the alpha subunit of the glycoprotein hormones. These results were used to reach a final diagnosis of pituitary gland metastasis from a primary breast carcinoma. The patient's vision improved significantly after surgery, and no recurrence was detected during 1 year of follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pituitary gland metastasis is rare and difficult to differentiate from a pituitary adenoma without a pathologic diagnosis. Surgery is the first choice for treatment. Surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy are combined with endocrine therapy to tailor treatment to the results of immunohistochemistry.

AB BACKGROUND: Spine surgery has the potential to benefit from the use of three-dimensional (3D) printing technology (additive manufacturing), particularly in cases of complex anatomic diseases. Custom devices have the potential to reduce operative times, reduce blood loss, provide immediate stability, and improve fusion rates.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 34-year-old man presented with 3-year history of bilateral L5 radiculopathy caused by bilateral L5 pars defect, L5/S1 degenerative disc disease, and severe foraminal stenosis. Anterior lumbar interbody fusion surgery was determined to be the most efficacious method for distraction of the disc space to increase the foraminal volume and stabilization of the motion segment. Surgical decompression and reconstruction was performed in combination with a 3D printed custom interbody implant. Custom design features included corrective angulation to restore lumbar lordosis, preplanned screw holes in the 3D implant, and device end plate interface geometry designed to shape-match with the patient's end plate anatomy.
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of patient-specific implants has reduced operative time significantly, which may offset costs of increased time spent preplanning the procedure. Surgical procedures can be preplanned using 3D models reconstructed from patient computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging scans. Planning can be aided by 3D printed models of patient anatomy, which surgeons can use in training before performing complex procedures. When considering implants and prostheses, the use of 3D printing allows a superior anatomic fit for the patient compared with generic devices, with the potential to improve restoration of nonpathologic anatomy.

ID CEREBROVASCULAR INJURY; ARTERY DISSECTION; PUNCTURE
AB BACKGROUND: Transseptal puncture has been widely used by cardiologists to reach the left side of the heart through a transvenous access. Rarely, it also can be used to pass into the supra-aortic arteries from the venous side when conventional transarterial access pathways (transfemoral, transradial/brachial routes, or direct carotid puncture) are likely to fail.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report 2 cases of transvenous femoral access followed by transseptal access to aorta to treat dissecting carotid artery aneurysms at the level of the skull base with flow diverters. In one case, multiple cervical arterial bypass operations and in the other a rare anomaly of the aortic arch precluded endovascular treatment through conventional routes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Transvenous-transseptal access enabled treatment of both cases easily and without complications. On follow-up computed tomography angiograms, both flow diverters were patent, there were no residual aneurysms, and no neurologic or cardiac adverse events in either patient.

   RESECTION; PEDIATRIC CRANIOPHARYNGIOMA; CRANIOFACIAL RESECTION
AB BACKGROUND: Endoscopic skull base surgery is a relatively new approach in the neurosurgical armamentarium and its usefulness is still being explored. As the field has evolved, so too have the results. For this reason, it is important to re-examine the outcomes of surgery for a variety of diseases individually over time to determine the appropriate indications for these approaches.
   METHODS: We performed a systematic review of recent literature (since 2012) of all studies using the endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) for craniopharyngioma, olfactory groove, planum sphenoidale, tuberculum sellae meningioma, esthesioneuroblastoma, chordoma, and chondrosarcoma and discuss outcomes compared with a transcranial approach (TCA). These results are also compared with a series of reviews of the literature that were performed before 2012 to see how results have evolved over time.
   RESULTS: For chordomas, craniopharyngioma and planum sphenoidale/tuberculum sellae meningiomas, EEA has shown superior outcomes to TCA for well-selected cases. Olfactory groove meningiomas still have a better outcome when performed using TCA. Esthesioneuroblastoma requires consideration of tumor stage and extent to select the appropriate approach, although with time, more advanced tumors have become approachable with EEA. Chondrosarcoma is a rare lesion that may be resectable by EEA when anatomy is favorable, although its rarity makes comparison difficult.
   CONCLUSIONS: Advances in EEA make it a useful tool that is at times superior to TCA for specific diseases based on recently published literature reporting rates of resection and complications. Ongoing re-evaluation of outcomes is essential to providing the best information to surgeons choosing an approach in each patient.

AB BACKGROUND: With recent advances in endoscopic skull base surgery, larger and more complex skull base defects are encountered and many possible reconstructive methods and materials are available. The purpose of this review is to summarize the possible causes of skull base defects, to describe the challenges associated with skull base reconstruction, and to detail the techniques and materials that may be used.
   METHODS: Literature review.
   RESULTS: Although skull base defects may be caused by traumatic or nontraumatic causes, this review focuses on the endoscopic reconstruction of defects. Many materials are available for endoscopic reconstruction and several techniques have been described for repair of skull base defects. With these advances, the outcomes of endoscopic skull base reconstruction have improved greatly over the past 20 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: Given the complexity of skull base defects and the multiple materials and techniques available for endoscopic reconstruction, a thorough understanding of the challenges associated with skull base repair is crucial for the endoscopic skull base surgeon.

AB BACKGROUND: Surgically manageable lesions involving the intracranial or intracanalicular portions of the optic nerve (cranial nerve II) can be approached through several different operative windows. Given the complex anatomy of the optic nerve and its surrounding neurovascular structures, it is essential to understand the conventional and topographic anatomy of the optic nerve from different surgical perspectives as well as its relationship with surrounding structures. We describe the intracranial and intracanalicular course of the optic nerve and present an analytical evaluation of the degree of exposure provided by several different transcranial and endoscopic surgical approaches.
   METHODS: Using 12 cadaveric specimens (24 sides), pterional, frontotemporal-orbital, supraorbital, unilateral subfrontal, and extended endonasal approaches were performed. The transcranial approaches were extended by removing the anterior clinoid process, unroofing the optic canal, and/or cutting the falciform ligament. The endonasal approach was extended using the transplanum transtuberculum, transmedial optic carotid recess, and transcanalicular modifications. The optic nerve was divided into proximal intracranial, distal intracranial, and intracanalicular segments, which were each divided coronally into quadrants and subquadrants, to evaluate their degree of exposure in each approach.
   RESULTS: The pterional approach provided 135 degrees of exposure along the superolateral aspects of the entire intracranial optic nerve, and 225 degrees of exposure of the intracanalicular optic nerve. The supraorbital and subfrontal approaches provided similar degrees of exposure, with 225 degrees-270 degrees of superolateral and superomedial exposure of the nerve along its intracranial and intracanalicular segments, depending on the approach extension used, with the subfrontal approach allowing for more medial control of the nerve. The endoscopic endonasal approach provided access to the inferior and medial quadrants of the optic nerve, allowing for 180 degrees of exposure.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the pterional approach provides the widest degree of surgical exposure of all optic nerve segments, the inferior and medial quadrants of the nerve can be adequately exposed only through an endoscopic endonasal approach. Optimal approach selection based on the intended target quadrant is essential for safe surgical exposure of the optic nerve.

AB BACKGROUND: Different inflammatory diseases can manifest as intracranial lesions. They may be indistinguishable from intracranial neoplasms in the clinical setting, imaging studies, or laboratory studies. The value of surgery in the diagnosis and the treatment of such lesions is still unclear.
   METHODS: A total of 3066 reports of histopathologic examinations over a 10-year period were reviewed. Forty patients with an inflammatory intracranial lesion were identified. Clinical, radiologic, and follow-up data were analyzed and the diagnostic and therapeutic value of surgery was assessed.
   RESULTS: We identified 24 women and 16 men (mean age, 47 years). The diameter of the lesion varied between 1 and 5.5 cm (mean, 2.6 cm). The location of the inflammatory lesion was intracerebral supratentorial (n = 18, 45%), intrasellar/suprasellar (n = 5, 12.5%), cerebellar (n = 5, 12.5%), in the brainstem (n = 4, 10%), in the cerebellopontine angle (n = 3, 7.5%), meningeal (n = 3, 7.5%), and at other locations (n[6, 15%). Seventeen patients underwent surgical removal of the mass lesion, whereas in 23 patients a biopsy was taken. The lesions were classified into 7 groups: specific (infectious) granuloma (n = 10, 25%), unspecific granuloma (n = 7, 17.5%), idiopathic inflammatory pseudotumor (n = 5, 12.5%), demyelinating lesions (n = 5, 12.5%) encapsulated hematoma (n = 4, 10%), organized cerebral infarction (n = 3, 7.5%), and vasculitis (n = 4, 10%). Surgery was judged as valuable in 35 patients (87.5%).
   CONCLUSIONS: The differential diagnosis of intracranial inflammatory lesions involves a wide spectrum. Surgery has a diagnostic and/or therapeutic value in most entities and clinical circumstances. However, attention must be taken to avoid surgery without a therapeutic or diagnostic value for the patient.

ID DEGENERATION; SUBSIDENCE; FRACTURE; CAGES
AB BACKGROUND: Little published data exist regarding normal values of disc height. Current literature relies on plain radiographs making accurate measurements of individual lumbar disc height difficult.
   OBJECTIVE: We seek to establish normal values for lumbar intervertebral discs in different age groups using computed tomography scans in healthy individuals.
   METHODS: Two hundred forty anonymized abdominal computed tomography scans (131 women) were prospectively collected once institutional review board approval was obtained. Individuals with spinal pathologies were excluded. Disc height measurements were obtained at the anterior edge, center, and posterior edge of each vertebra in the midsagittal plane, averaged, and compared against age and sex.
   RESULTS: Average age was 45 (14-83) years for women and 48 (14-89) years for men. Average lumbar disc height was 5.6 +/- 1.1 mm for men and 4.8 +/- 0.8 mm for women at T12/L1, 6.9 +/- 1.3 mm for men and 5.8 +/- 0.9 mm for women at L1/2, 8.1 +/- 1.4 mm for men and 6.9 +/- 1.1 mm for women at L2/3, 8.7 +/- 1.5 mm for men and 7.6 +/- 1.2 mm for women at L3/4, 9.2 +/- 1.6 mm for men and 8.5 +/- 1.6 mm for women at L4/5, and 8.8 +/- 1.6 mm for men and 8.6 +/- 1.8 mm for women at L5/S1. Disc height was significantly smaller for women than men (P < 0.001), except at L5/S1.
   CONCLUSIONS: Variation in disc height is determined much more by sex than age. The maximum height of the interbody space in the adult lumbar spine was at the L4/5 level (8.9 +/- 1.7 mm [men], 8.6 +/- 1.8 mm [women]). Based on our findings, >10 mm cage height will result in supraphysiologic interbody space restoration and potentially predispose to complications.

DT Article
DE CSF leak; Pituitary adenoma; Pituitary fossa; Risk factors;
   Transsphenoidal approach
ID RECONSTRUCTION; EXPERIENCE; COMPLICATIONS; REPAIR; RHINORRHEA;
   PREVENTION
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistulas are among the most clinically important and frequent complications of transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas. Between the adenoma and the CSF, a "barrier" exists that consists of <= 3 elements. These, from cephalad to caudad, are the arachnoid, dura mater (sellar diaphragm), and pituitary glandular tissue. The objective of the present study was to determine whether the presence or absence of any of these 3 anatomical elements would be associated with the development of an intraoperative CSF fistula.
   METHODS: From November 2016 to June 2018, 40 patients with pituitary adenomas underwent surgery, by transsphenoidal endonasal access, under a microscope. All procedures were filmed in 3 dimensions. The intraoperative findings and preoperative magnetic resonance images were analyzed and compared. The patients who had developed a fistula were compared against those who had not.
   RESULTS: In 20 patients, glandular tissue was identified between the tumor and subarachnoid space. In 13, dura mater was evident, and in 7, only the arachnoid was noted. An intraoperative CSF fistula occurred in 6 patients, all of whom had the arachnoid as the only barrier. The presence of a fistula was significantly more likely statistically for patients with an arachnoid-only barrier than for those with any other barrier composition (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: The anatomical architecture forming the roof of the pituitary fossa is an important determinant of intraoperative CSF fistula risk. When the barrier consists of only the arachnoid, the risk will be significantly greater than when the barrier contains additional elements. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging would be useful to determine the type of the existing barrier.

AB OBJECTIVE: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for movement disorders. Stereotactic electrode placement can be guided by intraoperative imaging, which also allows for immediate intraoperative quality control. This article is about implementation and refining a workflow applying intraoperative computed tomography (iCT) for DBS.
   METHODS: Eighteen patients underwent DBS with bilateral implantation of directional electrodes applying a 32-slice movable computed tomography scanner in combination with microelectrode recording.
   RESULTS: iCT led to a significant decrease in overall procedural time, despite performing multiple scans. In 3 of the initial 5 cases, iCT caused an adjustment of the final electrodes demonstrating the learning curve and the necessity to integrate road mapping for the exchange of microelectrode to final electrode. Implementation of low-dose computed tomography protocols added microelectrode iCT to the refined workflow, resulting in an intraoperative adjustment of a trajectory in 1 patient. Low-dose protocols lowered the total effective dose to 1.15 mSv, that is, a reduction by a factor of 3.5 compared to a standard non-iCT DBS procedure, despite repeated iCTs. Intraoperative lead detection based on final iCT revealed a radial error of 1.04 +/- 0.58 mm and a vector error of 2.28 +/- 0.97 mm compared to the preoperative planning, adjusted by the findings of microelectrode recording.
   CONCLUSIONS: iCT can be easily integrated into the surgical workflow resulting in an overall efficient timesaving procedure. Repeated intraoperative scanning ensures reliable electrode placement, although low-dose scanning protocols prevent extensive radiation exposure. iCT of microelectrodes is feasible and led to the adjustment of 1 electrode.

The data of 95 patients who underwent surgery at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University for HGG in functional brain areas from October 2014 to December 2017 were investigated. In the observation group, 49 patients underwent DTI preoperatively and received FLS for the removal of tumor during the operation. In the control group, 46 patients received the routine method. All patients were subjected to enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to assess the extent of tumor resection within 72 hours after operation. The changes in muscle strength and Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (KPS) scores were evaluated 1 month after surgery.
   RESULTS: The extent of resection was significantly higher in the observation group than in the control group (83.7% vs. 45.7%, respectively; P < 0.001). The rate of muscle strength reduction after surgery was remarkably lower in the observation group than in the control group (20.4% vs. 47.8%, respectively; P = 0.005). KPS scores were higher in the observation group than in the control group (73.5% vs. 47.8%, respectively; P = 0.029). In the observation group, the sensitivity of FLS in identifying tumor tissue was 91.7% (44/48), with a specificity of 90.0% (45/50).
   CONCLUSIONS: The application of DTI with FLS can facilitate the maximum resection of HGG in functional brain areas with minimum loss of fiber tracts, reduce the disability rate, and improve quality of postoperative life compared with traditional glioma surgery.

TI Stopping at Sacrum Versus Nonsacral Vertebra in Long Fusion Surgery for
   Adult Spinal Deformity: Meta-Analysis of Revision with Minimum 2-Year

AB OBJECTIVE: A pooled comparison was conducted on a revision to the sacrum (S) versus a nonsacral (NS) surgical strategy in adult spinal deformity (ASD).
   METHODS: Strictly following the PRISMA 2009 guidelines, the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were used to search for studies published in English up to March 2018 that addressed the S versus NS surgical approach for a long fusion to treat ASD. Data on total revisions and revision reasons were extracted from the included studies and were pooled analyzed.
   RESULTS: Eight retrospective studies with a total of 1846 ASD patients (528 S and 1318 NS) were included. The total revision rate was 11.38% (S: 17.80% and NS: 8.80%), and implant failure, pseudarthrosis, adjacent segment degeneration, and proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) were common reasons for revision. The pooled results indicated that the NS group had decreased incident rates of total revision (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-2.32, P = 0.002; I-2 = 0%) and pseudarthrosis (95% CI 2.16-15.44, P = 0.0005; I-2 = 0%) compared with the S group. No significant differences were observed in implant failure (95% CI 0.86-3.90, P = 0.12; I-2 = 0%), adjacent segment degeneration (95% CI 0.08-1.25, P = 0.10; I-2 = 0%), and PJK (95% CI 0.54-6.88, P = 0.35; I-2 = 0%) between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Revision in ASD patients is a serious problem with a total rate of 11.38%, and implant failure, pseudarthrosis, adjacent segment degeneration, and PJK are common reasons for revision. Stopping at the sacrum vertebra in long fusion surgery on ASD patients seems to increase the incidence rates of total revision and pseudarthrosis.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to characterize the use and associated costs of maximal nonoperative therapy (MNT) received within 2-years before anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) surgery in patients with symptomatic cervical stenosis.
   METHODS: An insurance database, including private/commercially insured and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, was queried for patients undergoing 1-level, 2-level, or 3-level ACDF procedures between 2007 and 2016. Research records were searchable by International Classification of Diseases diagnosis and procedure, Current Procedural Terminology, and generic drug codes. The use of MNTs within 2 years before index ACDF surgery was assessed by cost billed to patients, prescriptions written, and number of units billed.
   RESULTS: Of 220,902 (7.16%) eligible patients, 15,825 underwent index surgery. Patient breakdown of the use of MNT modalities was as follows: 5731 (36.2%) used nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs; 9827 (62.1%) used opioids; 7383 (46.7%) used muscle relaxants; 3609 (22.8%) received cervical epidural steroid injection; 5504 (34.8%) attended physical therapy/occupational therapy; 1663 (10.5%) received chiropractor treatments; and 200 (1.3%) presented to the emergency department. During the 2-year preoperative period, there were 51,675 prescriptions for diagnostic cervical imaging. The total direct cost associated with all MNTs before ACDF was $16,056,556. Cervical spine imaging comprised the largest portion of the total MNT cost ($8,677,110; 54.0%), followed by cervical epidural steroid injection ($3,315,913; 20.7%) and opioids ($2,228,221; 13.9%). Opiates were the most frequently prescribed therapy (71,602 prescriptions).
   DISCUSSION: Opioids are the most frequently prescribed and most used therapy in the preoperative period for cervical stenosis. Further studies and improved guidelines are necessary to determine which patients may benefit from ACDF earlier in the course of nonoperative therapies.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the advantages of endoscopy and navigational assistance in the intradural subtemporal keyhole approach and the intradural Kawase approach by studying anatomic exposure and surgical freedom in the posterior cranial fossa.
   METHODS: Twenty endoscopic intradural subtemporal keyhole approaches (EISKA) were performed on 10 cadaveric heads. An intradural Kawase approach and a navigation-assisted intradural Kawase approach were then carried out on a random side of each specimen. Related anatomic structures were observed through a 0 degrees endoscope and a microscope. Anatomic exposure and surgical freedom were measured by transparent graph paper and analyzed.
   RESULTS: Compared with themicrosurgical technique, the superior, inferior, and medial limits of the endoscopic anatomic exposure increased by 2.9, 15.65, and 10.2 mm, whereas the surgical freedom increased by 2.9, 7.55, and 6mm (P < 0.05) in the intradural subtemporal keyhole approach. In the intradural Kawase approach and the navigation-assisted intradural Kawase approach, the endoscopic anatomic exposure and surgical freedom also increased (P < 0.05). Using a frameless navigational device, the inferior limit of the anatomic exposure increased 3.8 mm by endoscopy and 3.5 mm by microscopy, whereas the surgical freedom increased by 2.7 and 2.2 mm, respectively (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: The EISKA provides greater anatomic exposure and surgical freedom primarily in the superior, inferior, and medial directions of the brainstem region. Maximum anatomic exposure and surgical freedom of the posterior cranial fossa was obtained by navigational assistance with fewer complications.

AB INTRODUCTION: The anterior petrosectomy approach is among the most popular for exposure of the petroclival region. However, the complexity of the anatomy, drilling time required, and risk of injury to neurovascular structures have made this procedure especially challenging. We have proposed a novel combined extradural-intradural technique for en bloc anterior petrosectomy-or one-piece Kawase-and have charted the landmarks that define its surgical boundaries.
   METHODS: The approach was performed on 14 embalmed specimens. The one-piece Kawase approach consists of 3 extradural drilling steps, followed by incision of the dura and skeletonization of the superior petrosal sinus. The procedure culminates with 2 intradural drilling steps. The bone piece was then removed en bloc, and the maximum anteroposterior, superoinferior, and mediolateral lengths were recorded. The linear distances between the main neurovascular landmarks were also measured using a stereotactic navigation system.
   RESULTS: The mean measurements were 17.6 +/- 2.6 mm for the anteroposterior distance, 10.5 +/- 2.3 mm for the superoinferior distance, and 9.5 +/- 2.6 mm for the mediolateral distance. The medial linear distance from the mandibular nerve/greater superficial petrosal nerve to the internal carotid artery was 6.8 +/- 1.3 mm, to the facial hiatus was 11.6 +/- 2.2 mm, and to the lateral internal acoustic canal was 17.9 +/- 1.8 mm. The average distance from the porus trigeminus to the medial internal acoustic canal was 19.4 mm.
   CONCLUSIONS: The advantages of this technique include the wide exposure of the petroclival region, extensive visualization of critical structures via extradural and intradural corridors, and minimization of bone drilling, which could reduce heat damage. Clinical application of the illustrated technique is required to test its reliability in different pathological subsets.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify clinical factors predicting the development of myelopathy in cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) patients with radiculopathy.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 83 cervical OPLL patients who presented with radiculopathy. On the basis of the symptoms and physical findings, we divided patients into 2 groups: myelopathy group and non-myelopathy group. Demographic, clinical, and radiologic characteristics were reviewed and analyzed among the 2 groups. Predictors for the development of myelopathy were assessed via univariate and multivariate analysis.
   RESULTS: Univariate analysis demonstrated that a high occupying ratio and the presence of an intramedullary high signal were risk factors for development of myelopathy from radiculopathy in OPLL patients. Multivariate analysis further identified that a high occupying ratio was the only independent predictor (odds ratio 1.05, 95% confidence interval 1.003-1.091, P = 0.035). The cervical range of motion and minor trauma were not related to the development of myelopathy in our study.
   CONCLUSIONS: Nonmyelopathic OPLL patients with radiculopathy and a high occupying ratio were at higher risk of developing myelopathy, and surgical intervention should be recommended in these cases. However, for elderly patients with significant comorbid conditions, the risks and benefits of surgery should be carefully considered.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Cognitive impairment; Delayed cerebral ischemia; Outcome measures;
   Subarachnoid hemorrhage
ID MINI-MENTAL-STATE; PREDICTION
AB BACKGROUND: Measures such as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) may not reflect cognitive outcome following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between functional outcome, measured by mRS, and cognition, measured by mini-mental state examination (MMSE), after aSAH. A secondary analysis evaluated the impact of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) on the proportion of patients who had cognitive impairment.
   METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis of the Clazosentan to Overcome Neurological Ischemia and Infarction Occurring After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (CONSCIOUS-1) trial data. MMSE and mRS scores were compared using Kruskal-Wallis equality-of-populations rank test with pairwise comparison post hoc analysis. Cognitive impairment was defined as MMSE score <27. A stepwise logistic regression model evaluated whether DCI was a predictor of cognitive impairment.
   RESULTS: CONSCIOUS-1 comprised 413 patients. Of these, 337 took an MMSE at their 12-week follow-up. Mean MMSE score was 27 with a median of 29 (range, 0-30; SD 5.4). There were no significant differences between MMSE scores of patients who had 12-week mRS scores of 0-2. On multivariate analysis, DCI was independently associated with cognitive impairment after aSAH.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients considered to have a good outcome on mRS had varying degrees of cognitive function on MMSE, whereas development of DCI was an independent predictor of cognitive impairment after aSAH. MMSE may not be sensitive enough to discern subtle defects in cognition, as the median score was 29 out of 30.

   Retrospective Study in 9 Patients
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Herniated lumbar disk; Spontaneous resorption
ID INTERVERTEBRAL DISC; SPONTANEOUS REGRESSION; NATURAL-HISTORY; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Spontaneous resorption of herniated lumbar disk was explained in the literature by different mechanisms, and multiple predictive factors for resorption were reported in numerous studies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the phenomena of spontaneous resorption of herniated lumbar disk without surgery (mechanisms, predictive factors, expected time for resorption, and proper time for conservative treatment).
   METHODS: This retrospective clinical case series included 9 patients with herniated lumbar disk on initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The mean age was 39 +/- 6.3 years, and the male to female ratio was 2:1. All patients presented with back pain and sciatica without motor deficit. All patients refused surgical intervention; therefore, they were treated conservatively. Patients were followed-up clinically and radiologically (MRI) in the outpatient clinic on regular visits (for 18 months).
   RESULTS: Spontaneous resorption of herniated disk was found in all patients in a mean time of 8.7 +/- 3.2 months. All patients recovered clinically in a mean time of 5.7 +/- 1.6 weeks by conservative treatment. Large and/or sequestrated disks were associated with rapid resorption. Early recovery patients showed early spontaneous resorption of the disk.
   CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous resorption of herniated lumbar disk can occur by different mechanisms (retraction, dehydration, and inflammatory mediated mechanism). Large and/or sequestrated disks are essential predictive factors for rapid spontaneous resorption. Furthermore, early clinical recovery is usually associated with quick resorption of the herniated disk.

AB OBJECTIVE: The supraorbital keyhole approach through an eyebrow incision has been a potentially less invasive approach as an alternative to the standard pterional craniotomy. We aimed to review procedures for anterior and middle cranial fossa lesions and identify lessons learned from addressing various pathologies through this approach.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 106 consecutive patients who underwent this approach. We documented patients' age, sex, pathology, clinical results, extent of tumor resection, complications, use of endoscope, and cosmetic results.
   RESULTS: Our series addressed a variety of pathologies. Male patients accounted for 55% of the cohort and mean age was 51.7 (2-79) years. Notably, 52% of patients underwent resection of extra-axial masses. Gross total resection was achieved in 74.4% of intra-axial lesions according to postoperative imaging. Two (1.9%) patients developed transient ptosis. One (0.9%) patient developed an allergic reaction to titanium. No cerebrospinal fluid fistula or rhinorrhea occurred. Three patients developed temporary diabetes insipidus after resection of parasellar lesions (2 craniopharyngiomas and 1 pituitary adenoma). In 14 patients with olfactory groove meningiomas, 6 (42.8%) suffered from absence or diminished olfaction postoperatively, and 2 (14.2%) developed postoperative anosmia. Five (38.5%) patients underwent a subsequent resection of recurrent glial tumors. Four weeks postoperatively, 95% of patients demonstrated acceptable cosmetic results. Cosmetic results for 6 (5%) patients were unavailable.
   CONCLUSIONS: The supraorbital keyhole approach may be safely used for various lesions within the anterior and middle cranial fossa. The effectiveness and limitations of this approach and possible complications are discussed. This is a valuable approach for selected patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: We studied the effect of different cervicothoracic construct design variables on biomechanical stability in vitro.
   METHODS: Six fresh-frozen human cadaveric spines (C5-T4) were used. After intact analysis, each specimen was destabilized and reconstructed, with all groups having 4.0-mm pedicle screws placed at T1-T3. The 2 hook-rod constructs included interlaminar hooks at C6 and C7, with either 3.5-mm or 4.0-mm rods (C6-T3). The 2 screw-rod constructs tested included lateral mass screws at C6 and C7, with either 3.5-mm or 4.0-mm rods (C6-T3). The 2 screw-connector-rod constructs tested included lateral mass screws at C6 and C7, with either 3.5-mm or 4.0-mm rods; 1 rod spanned C6-C7 with a connector to a second rod of the same size spanning T1-T3. Global (C6-T3) and intervertebral (C6-C7, C7-T1, T1-T2, and T2-T3) ranges of motion were compared for each construct.
   RESULTS: In terms of global (C6-T3) stability, 3.5-mm versus 4.0-mm rod constructs were not significantly different, regardless of whether the construct was hook-rod, screw-rod, or screw-connector-rod. The hook-rod constructs provided less stability compared with the screw-rod and screw-connector-rod constructs in lateral bending (P < 0.04) and axial rotation (P < 0.001). The screw-rod constructs demonstrated a similar range of motion to that of the screw-connector-rod constructs, except for significantly less axial rotation at the C6-C7 level with 3.5-mm rods (P = 0.04).
   CONCLUSIONS: We found that the rod diameter of a construct does not appear to significantly influence the biomechanical stability of subaxial constructs. The screw-rod construct resulted in certain biomechanical advantages compared with the screw-connector-rod construct, and both were significantly superior to the hook-rod construct.

TI A Quality Analysis of Disc Herniation Videos on YouTube
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Disc; Hernia; Herniation; Internet; Quality; Video; YouTube
ID HEALTH INFORMATION; INTERNET
AB BACKGROUND: An increasing number of patients are investigating health information by using the Internet because of its exponential growth. Therefore, it is important to test the accuracy of the information presented to determine which information should not be shared. This study investigated the information available on YouTube with regard to disc herniation.
   METHODS: The first 50 videos found after the keyword "disc herniation" was used in the YouTube search engine were included in the study. Video popularity was evaluated with an index called the video power index (VPI). The quality and accuracy of the information were evaluated by 2 independent spinal surgeons using the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) score and the DISCERN scoring system. Interobserver agreement and individual correlations of the data of each video were statistically analyzed.
   RESULTS: Of the 50 videos evaluated, 16 (32%) contained animation and 34 (64%) contained real images. The mean duration was 6.587 minutes, and the mean view was 423.472. The mean DISCERN score was 30.7 (+/- 10.3), and the mean JAMA score was 1.8 (+/- 0.5). There was good agreement between the 2 researchers in terms of DISCERN and JAMA scores. No statistically significant correlation was found between the JAMA and DISCERN scores of both researchers and VPI values, video lengths, animation, or real images.
   CONCLUSIONS: The quality of the disc herniation information offered on YouTube is low. The evaluation of medical information obtained from the Internet by health professionals is an important step in guiding the correct flow of medical information to patients.

TI Evaluation of Clinical and Histologic Effects of High-Dose Radiosurgery
   on Rat Dorsal Root Ganglion
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Dorsal root ganglion; Neuromodulation; Pain; Radiosurgery
ID CERVICAL RADICULAR PAIN; STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY; MODEL
AB BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an effective technique to create lesions of the trigeminal nerve to treat refractory trigeminal neuralgia. In the lumbar spine, the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) contains the body of the sensory neurons responsible for pain sensitivity. Neuromodulation of the DRG might therefore improve chronic peripheral pain. This study was performed to determine the feasibility, clinical, and histologic effects of delivering high-dose SRS targeted to the lumbar DRG in a rat model.
   METHODS: Four Sprague Dawley male rats underwent 80 Gy maximum-dose single-fraction SRS to the left L5 and L6 DRG using the Leksell Gamma Knife Icon (Elekta, Atlanta, Georgia, USA). The right L5 and L6 DRGs served as controls. The animals were evaluated for motor and sensory deficits every 2 weeks and were sacrificed at 3 and 6 months after SRS. Common histologic techniques were used to assess for fibrosis and demyelination at the target levels.
   RESULTS: No detectable motor or sensory deficits were seen in any animal. Histologic changes including fibrosis and loss of myelin were noted to the left L5 and L6 DRGs, but not the right side control DRGs. Fibrotic changes within the vertebral body were also evident on the treated sides of the vertebral bodies.
   CONCLUSIONS: We were able to detect a demyelinating response from SRS delivered to the DRG in rats. Because such changes mimic those seen after trigeminal SRS in experimental animals, we hypothesize that radiosurgery may be a potential option in chronic spinal radicular pain amenable to neuromodulation.

AB OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that women undergoing scoliosis surgery who became pregnant would go to full term, have uncomplicated pregnancies, and similar patient-reported outcome measures than non-pregnant patients and healthy controls.
   METHODS: Two hundred five women with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) undergoing scoliosis surgery between 1998 and 2015 at several institutions in 1 country and 173 healthy women, without AIS, parous and nulliparous, were selected at random.
   RESULTS: One hundred eight women with scoliosis surgery and no pregnancy (SNP), 97 women with scoliosis surgery and pregnancy (SP), 91 healthy controls and no pregnancy, and 82 healthy controls and pregnancy (HP) were reviewed. Mean follow-up was 5 years in the SNP, 6 years in the SP, 5 years in the healthy controls and no pregnancy, and 5 years in the HP. The average time from surgery to childbirth was 5 years. Back pain (BP) during pregnancy was observed in 48% of the SP and 34% of the HP. BP after childbirth was present in 43% of the SP and 42% of the HP. Patients fused to L3 or L4 experienced more frequent low BP during pregnancy (40%) than those fused above L3 (P < 0.05). Cesarean section (CS) was performed for 64% and 33% in SP and HP, respectively (P < 0.05). As the lowest instrumented vertebra moved caudal to L4, the frequency of CS increased (P < 0.05; R = 0.8). The majority of CS in SP were performed in patients fused to L4 (55%) versus patients fused above and to L3 (45%) (P < 0.05). The most common analgesia for CS was spinal block (75% in SP and 86% in HP). Patients fused to L4 required general anesthesia significantly more often (7%) versus those fused above L4 (4%, P < 0.05). The health-related quality of life after spinal fusion showed general satisfaction and were similar for SNP and SP (mean 3.84 and 3.91, respectively). No sexual dysfunction was reported.
   CONCLUSIONS: Women with a history of spinal fusion for AIS fused to L3 or L4 reported a higher incidence of low BP, and CSs are more frequently required. This risk increased to 55% when spinal fusion to L4 was performed. The quality of life and sexual function were at the same level in women after scoliosis surgery than in healthy controls.

ID LUMBAR SPINE; CLASSIFICATION; ANATOMY; FASCIA; MARKER; L5
AB BACKGROUND: Transverse process fractures in trauma patients frequently are diagnosed using computed tomography and result in severe pain and limitation of motion. However, there is no accepted standard of care. Thus, these fractures can be treated with excessive measures or inadequately treated. In this study, diagnosis and treatment of transverse process fractures are examined.
   METHODS: The mechanisms of trauma, findings, and associated organ injuries of 50 patients with transverse process fractures and no other spinal injuries treated between 2013 and 2015 were recorded. The same treatment protocol was applied to each patient. The results of the treatments were examined retrospectively and recorded.
   RESULTS: Deformation and edema of the fascia and muscles around the transverse process fractures were detected by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The average pain intensity of the patients before treatment was 8.8 of 10 on a visual analog scale and 5.2 of 10 after treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants, flexible support corsets, and mobilization. Patients hospitalized for additional pathologies were primarily treated in thoracic surgery wards (11 of 15 patients). Transverse process fractures were caused by backward falls or blows to the back in 49 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Transverse process fractures can be treated quickly and effectively with the recommended protocol after excluding any accompanying organ injuries or other spinal injuries. Transverse process fractures most often occur during backward falls or blows to the back, commonly low-energy injuries. This trauma mechanism can be described as a "coronal injury of the spine."

ID INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE; ETIOLOGY; YIELD
AB OBJECTIVE: Primary intraventricular hemorrhage (PIVH) is rare in the aging population and remains a challenge for cerebrovascular surgeons. In the present study, the authors reviewed the patient characteristics, angiographic results, and treatments and determined clinical outcomes in 34 patients older than 60 years of age who were treated at West China Hospital between 2010 and 2014.
   METHODS: The medical records of elderly patients were queried. The parameters regarding patient demographics, presenting symptoms, treatment modalities, angiographic results, and clinical outcomes were assessed and analyzed.
   RESULTS: There were 19 male (55.9%) and 15 female (44.1%) patients, with an average age (+/- SD) of 67.9 +/- 7.7 years in our study. The most common symptoms on presentation were headache (50%), followed by disturbance of consciousness (26.5%). Only 5 patients (14.3%) were diagnosed with underlying cerebrovascular etiologies including Moyamoya disease (5.9%), arteriovenous malformations (2.9%), and aneurysms (5.9%). Idiopathic PIVH was diagnosed in 29 patients (85.7%). Thirteen patients (38.2%) underwent surgical intervention, while 21 patients (61.8%) received conservative treatment. Twelve patients (35.3%) had an unfavorable outcome at discharge, and an unfavorable outcome was observed in 14 patients (41.2%) at the 3-month follow-up. Patients with higher Graeb score might be associated with an unfavorable outcome both in shortterm and long-term follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Most PIVH patients were diagnosed with idiopathic PIVH in the elderly. Surgical treatment of aging patients should be optimized to improve clinical outcomes. The admission Graeb scores were considered to be the independent prognostic factors for both short-term and long-term outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) is an effective treatment of upper lumbar intervertebral disk herniation. However, its clinical efficacy for adjacent segment disk degeneration (ASDD) remains undefined. Therefore, the biomechanical evaluation of ASDD caused by TLIF after pedicle screw fixation (PSF) was explored via a 3-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis.
   METHODS: Computed tomography images of a healthy male adult volunteer were used in this study. A L3-4 3D finite element model (model) was successfully constructed using Pro/E software, which was also used to establish the L4-5 of the TLIF, PSF, and PSF + TLIF models. Under the same loading conditions, the protrusion and retraction of the adjacent intervertebral disk and the stress distribution of the annulus fibrosis, facet joint, and articular process in the TLIF, PSF, and PSF + TLIF models were all compared.
   RESULTS: Protrusion and retraction of the adjacent intervertebral disk were more notable in the PSF + TLIF model than in the PSF model under the same loading conditions. The stress of the annulus fibrosis of the PSF + TLIF model was stronger relative to that of the PSF model under flexion, extension, or lateral bending. The stress of the articular process of the PSF + TLIF model was also stronger than that of the PSF model under extension or lateral bending.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that TLIF may aggravate ASDD after PSF. Furthermore, the findings provided in this report represent the theoretic basis for the clinical analysis of ASDD caused by TLIF after PSF.

AB BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare radiographic outcomes of adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery with or without 2-level prophylactic vertebroplasty (PVP) at the uppermost instrumented vertebra (UIV) and the vertebra 1 level proximal to the UIV.
   METHODS: This retrospective 1: 2 matched-cohort comparative study enrolled 2 groups of patients undergoing ASD surgery, including 28 patients with PVP (PVP group) and 56 patients without PVP (non-PVP group), in 3 institutes between 2012 and 2015. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK), proximal junctional failure (PJF), and proximal junctional fracture (PJFX). The secondary outcome measure were radiologic outcomes between PVP segments and non-PVP segments.
   RESULTS: Between the PVP group and non-PVP group, no significant differences were found in the incidence of PJK (13 = 46.4%] vs. 26 = 46.4%]; P = 1.000), PJF (11 = 39.3%] vs. 18 = 32.1%]; P = 0.516), and PJFX (11 = 39.3%] vs. 18 = 32.1%]; P = 0.516). The number of the PJFX segments was 16 and 33 in PVP segments and non-PVP segments, respectively. Until revision surgery or final follow-up, the PJFX had progressed in 24 non-PVP segments (82.7%), but not in PVP segments. The PJFX progression in all PVP segments stopped near the PVP mass at the final follow-up. Reoperation as a result of PJFX was performed in 1 patient (3.6%) and 8 patients (14.3%) in the PVP and non-PVP groups, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: PVP at UIV and vertebra 1 level proximal to the UIV cannot prevent PJK, PJF, and PJFX; however, it plays a positive role by delaying their progression. Furthermore, PVP tends to lower the reoperation rate after PJFX in ASD surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: The development of postcraniotomy hematoma (PCH) after surgery for acute traumatic subdural hematoma (aSDH) has been associated with an increased risk of a poor outcome. The risk factors contributing to PCH remain poorly understood. Our aim was to study the potential risk factors for PCH in a consecutive series of surgically evacuated patients with aSDH.
   METHODS: A total of 132 patients with aSDH treated at Turku University Hospital (Turku, Finland) from 2008 to 2012 were enrolled in the present retrospective cohort study. The demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging data were collected from the medical records. A comprehensive analysis of the data using 6 different univariate methods, including machine learning and multivariate analyses, was conducted to identify the factors related to PCH.
   RESULTS: The incidence of PCH after primary surgery for traumatic aSDH was 10.6%. The patients experiencing PCH were younger (P = 0.04). No difference was found in the use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication for the patients with and without PCH. Multivariate analyses identified alcohol inebriation at the time of injury (odds ratio [OR], 12.67; P = 0.041) and hypocapnia (OR, 26.09; P = 0.003) as independent risk factors for PCH. The patients with PCH had had hyponatremia (OR, 0.08; P = 0.018) less often, and their maximal systolic blood pressure was lower (OR, 0.94; P = 0.009). The area under the curve for the multivariate model was 0.96 (P = 0.049), with a Youden index of 0.88.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that alcohol inebriation at the time of injury and hypocapnia during hospitalization are risk factors for the development of PCH.

AB BACKGROUND: Many prognostic factors influence overall survival (OS) of patients with glioblastoma. Despite gross total resection and Stupp protocol adherence, many patients have poor survival. Perfusion magnetic resonance imaging may assist in diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and prognostication.
   METHODS: This retrospective study of 36 patients with glioblastoma assessed influence of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging parameters reflecting tumor cell density and vascularity and patient age on OS.
   RESULTS: The area under curve based on optimal receiver operating characteristic curves for the perfusion parameters normalized relative tumor blood volume (n_rTBV) and normalized relative tumor blood flow (n_rTBF) were 0.92 and 0.89, respectively, and the highest among all imaging parameters and age. OS showed strongly negative correlations with corrected n_rTBV (R = -0.70; P < 0.001) and n_rTBF (R = -0.67; P < 0.001). The Cox model, which included age and imaging parameters, demonstrated that n_rTBV and n_rTBF were most predictive of OS, with hazard ratios of 5.97 (P = 0.0001) and 8.76 (P = 0.0001), respectively, compared with 1.63 (P = 0.19) for age. Eighteen patients with corrected n_rTBV <= 2.5 (best cutoff value) had a median OS of 15.1 months (95% confidence interval (CI), 11.34-21.25) compared with 2.8 months (95% CI, 1.48-4.03; P < 0.001) for 18 patients with corrected n_rTBV >2.5. Twenty-four patients with n_rTBF <= 2.79 had a median OS of 12 months (95% CI, 10.46-17.9) compared with 2.8 months for 12 patients with n_rTBF >2.79 (95% CI, 1.31-4.2; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: The dominant predictors of OS are normalized perfusion parameters n_rTBV and n_rTBF. Preoperative perfusion imaging may be used as a surrogate to predict glioblastoma aggressiveness and survival independent of treatment.

ID CRANIOTOMY; HEMICRANIECTOMY; MORBIDITY
AB BACKGROUND: We redesigned decompressive craniectomy and cranioplasty procedures to decrease the inherent risk of complications. This novel technique, called decompressive cranioplasty, not only may decrease the complication rate but also may improve the cosmetic result, obviate the need for artificial skull implant, and increase the decompressive volume compared with traditional craniectomy.
   METHODS: In decompressive cranioplasty, the Agnes Fast craniotomy was adopted without cutting the temporalis muscle from the underlying bone flap. After opening the dura with or without removal of intracranial hematomas, duraplasty was performed with an intracranial pressure monitor inserted. Four miniplates were bent into a "Z" shape, and the vascularized bone flap was elevated approximately 1.2-1.5 cm above the outer cortex of the skull and fixed with the miniplates. Subsequent cranioplasty was done with a mini-incision on the miniplate sites and reshaping of the miniplate to align the outer cortex of the bone flap.
   RESULTS: We successfully performed decompressive cranioplasty in 3 emergent cases-2 traumatic subdural hematomas and 1 malignant middle cerebral artery infarction. Postoperative brain computed tomography demonstrated adequate decompression in all cases. Cosmetic outcome was excellent, and there was no temporal hallowing. Mastication function was not affected. At 6-month follow-up, there was no bone flap shrinkage and no hydrocephalus.
   CONCLUSIONS: Decompressive cranioplasty is a safe and effective method in the management of patients with brain edema and intracranial hypertension. It is simple to perform and may reduce the morbidity associated with traditional decompressive craniectomy and subsequent cranioplasty.

DE Epithelioid glioblastoma; Misdiagnosed; Radiological imaging features
ID BRAF V600E; TERT PROMOTER; GRADE
AB OBJECTIVE: We review the radiological imaging features and report histopathological findings of 7 adult patients with epithelioid glioblastoma (eGBM), which was a newly revised subtype of glioblastoma.
   METHODS: Seven adult patients with a diagnosis of eGBM on a brain tissue specimen were retrospectively confirmed by pathology. The tumor magnetic resonance imaging characteristics such as location, number, edema, necrosis, hemorrhage, enhancement, diffusion-weighted image, apparent diffusion coefficient, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, dynamic susceptibility contrast-perfusione-weighted imaging, and histopathological findings were documented.
   RESULTS: The tumors of these patients exhibited iso-hyperintensive signal on the T2-weighted image and iso-hypointensive signal on the T1-weighted image. All the lesions manifested iso-hypointensive signal on the diffusion-weighted image, and 2 cases showed significantly restricted hyperintensive signal (2/7). Peritumoral edema in all cases was mild. Five cases were located in the cortical lobe (5/7) and the other 2 were multifocal (2/7). Four cases showed white matter collapse sign (4/7). These tumors revealed apparent enhancement after contrast injection. In particular, 4 cases displayed capsuled sign (4/7), 2 cases showed dura mater tail sign (2/7), and 1 case showed hemorrhage (1/7). The mean value of apparent diffusion coefficient in 6 cases was 1.09 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s. The mean value of relative cerebral blood volume in 3 cases was 2.84 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s on dynamic susceptibility contrast-perfusione-weighted imaging. The average value of the choline/N-acetyl aspartate ratio in 4 cases was 6.47 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s on magnetic resonance spectroscopy. All cases expressed a BRAF V600E mutation according to molecular characteristics.
   CONCLUSIONS: eGBMs that were predominantly located in cortex with mild peritumoral edema, white matter collapse, encapsular sign, and dura mater tail sign could be easily misdiagnosed as cortex-involved intracranial brain tumor such as meningioma, whereas multifocal tumors could be easily misdiagnosed as metastatic tumor and lymphoma. Multimodal images were helpful for the differential diagnosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Interaction between the stent retriever and clot is a key factor for recanalization during mechanical thrombectomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between radiographically apparent features during thrombectomy and angiographic outcomes using the Trevo stent retriever with a fully radiopaque strut.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 50 patients with acute middle cerebral artery occlusion who were treated with the Trevo. Patients were divided into groups that achieved (first-pass recanalization group, n = 21) or did not achieve (non-first-pass recanalization group, n = 29) a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Ischemia score of 2b or 3 with the first-pass procedure. Patients were also divided into a thromboembolic (n = 39) and atherosclerotic (n = 11) group by occlusion etiology. We evaluated radiographic findings of the Trevo's strut (e.g., degree of stent expansion and filling defect of the thrombus in the strut [in-stent thrombus sign]) during the first-pass procedure.
   RESULTS: Median stent expansion was significantly greater in the first-pass recanalization group than in the non-first-pass recanalization group (60% vs. 34%; P < 0.01) and in the thromboembolic group than in the atherosclerotic group (45% vs. 31%; P < 0.01). The receiver operator characteristic curve showed moderate capacity for prediction of recanalization and etiology, with an area under the curve of 0.83 and 0.73, respectively. In-stent thrombus sign was significantly more common in the thromboembolic group than in the atherosclerotic group (86% vs. 10%; P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Greater stent expansion was associated with recanalization after thrombectomy. The in-stent thrombus sign may be useful for etiology prediction. These radiographic findings could provide useful real-time feedback during procedures, reflecting clot-stent interaction.

TI Gerber's Ligament-A Forgotten Structure of the Craniocervical Junction
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Accessory band; Anatomy; Craniocervical junction; Cruciform ligament;
   Transverse ligament
ID SURFACE ANATOMY; MEMBRANE; ALAR
AB BACKGROUND: Ligaments of the craniocervical junction play a critical role in stabilizing this region. Gerber's ligament has more or less been forgotten and, to our knowledge, never studied.
   METHODS: Dissection of the craniocervical junction was performed in 15 fresh frozen cadavers. In the prone position, the posterior elements of the upper cervical vertebrae and occiput were removed. After removing the contents of the spinal canal and posterior cranial fossa, the dura mater and tectorial membrane were reflected. The superior band of the cruciform ligament was reflected. When Gerber's ligament was identified, its attachments and morphometry were recorded. Lastly, Gerber's ligament was observed while range of motion of the craniocervical junction was performed.
   RESULTS: Gerber's ligament was identified in 7 specimens (46.7%). This structure arose anteriorly from the junction of the superior band and transverse part of the cruciform ligament. Gerber's ligament was always found to be just deep to the superior band of the cruciform ligament but traveled more anteriorly to attach onto the posterior aspect of the dens approaching, but not attaching onto, its apex. Mean length was 11 mm, and mean width was 7 mm. Thickness of the ligament was 0.5-1.1 mm. The ligament was found to become taut with minimal rotation of the atlantoaxial joint and extension of the craniocervical junction.
   CONCLUSIONS: A good understanding of all ligaments of the craniocervical junction is important to surgeons and physicians treating patients with injury to the upper cervical spine.

ID SURGICAL-MANAGEMENT; HEMORRHAGE RISK
AB BACKGROUND: We evaluated clinical outcomes in patients with symptomatic brainstem cavernous malformations (CMs) treated by stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).
   METHODS: Between 1988 and 2016, Gamma Knife SRS was performed in 76 evaluable patients with solitary symptomatic brainstem CMs. Forty-nine (66%) were intrinsic (not reaching a pial or ependymal surface). Most patients (91%) had experienced 2 or more hemorrhages associated with new neurologic deficits. Fourteen patients (18%) underwent resection before radiosurgery. The median CM volume was 0.66 cm(3) (range, 0.05-6.8), and the median margin dose was 15.0 Gy.
   RESULTS: After SRS, 15 patients (20%) had an imaging confirmed new hemorrhage at a median follow-up of 48 months. The hemorrhage-free survival after SRS for brainstem CMs was 92% at 1 year, 87% at 3 years, and 85% at 5 years. The annual hemorrhage rate was 31% before and 4% after SRS. In univariate analysis, CM volume, previous surgical resection, and increased number of hemorrhages before SRS were significantly associated with a higher rate of hemorrhage after SRS. In multivariate analysis, only number of previous hemorrhages was significant (P < 0.0005; hazard ratio, 1.51, 95% confidence interval, 1.23-1.85). Symptomatic adverse radiation effects developed in 7 patients (9%). The rate of symptom deterioration related to hemorrhage or symptomatic adverse radiation effects was 10% at 1 year, 18% at 3 years, and 20% at 5 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with an increased rate of hemorrhage before SRS had an increased risk of repeat hemorrhage and symptom deterioration rate after SRS. Intrinsic CM location did not significantly affect rates of symptom deterioration or rebleeding.

TI Supraorbital Occipital Circumferential Stimulation for the Treatment of
   Refractory Chronic Primary Headache: A Case Series
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Headache; Migraine; Pain; Supraorbital occipital stimulation treatment
ID NERVE-STIMULATION; CHRONIC MIGRAINE; PREVALENCE; DISABILITY
AB BACKGROUND: Patients with refractory chronic primary headache disorders have extremely debilitating symptoms, severe comorbidities (e.g., anxiety, depression), and a significant reduction in quality of life. The headaches are extremely difficult to treat, as they are often refractory to pharmacologic and procedural interventions. Neuromodulation with stimulation of the occipital and supraorbital nerves has been proposed as a viable treatment for these refractory headaches. We retrospectively review the long-term (33.5 +/- 20 months) results of supraorbital occipital nerve circumferential stimulation (SOCS) in patients with chronic primary headache disorders.
   METHODS: We retrospectively review 25 patients who were evaluated for SOCS for chronic primary headache disorders from 2010 to 2017 at a single institution with a single neurosurgeon.
   RESULTS: Of these 25 patients, 14 saw benefits to their trial stage of stimulation and underwent full implantation. A total 3 patients were excluded from further analysis because of having < 2 months of follow-up or discordant data. Of the 11 patients analyzed, there was an overall response rate (>= 50% pain reduction) of 82%. The average preoperative 10-point pain score dropped from 7.1 +/- 1.6 to a postoperative score of 3.3 +/- 2.1. However, there was a high rate of complications including infection, erosion, and loss of effect.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results (82% response) suggest that SOCS may be an effective treatment and should be studied more extensively. Occipital nerve stimulation alone has shown 40% to 50% response rate in published studies. However, the relatively high complication rate highlights an obstacle for the approach for the treatment of refractory headache disorders and room for device optimization.

AB OBJECTIVE: By extracting clinical and computed tomography imaging data of patients with acute subdural hematoma (ASDH), factors that were significantly associated with poor prognosis were screened and a nomogram model was established and validated.
   METHODS: All patients with ASDH who underwent subdural hematoma removal and decompressive craniectomy from January 2014 to March 2018 in Qinghai Provincial People's Hospital were continuously collected. Finally, 124 patients were included in the study. According to the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 3 months after operation, patients were divided into a good prognosis group and a poor prognosis group.
   RESULTS: Univariate and binary logistic regression analysis were performed to screen out independent predictors that were significantly associated with poor prognosis of ASDH. On the basis of these factors, a nomogram model was established.
   CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram model had high accuracy for predicting poor prognosis in patients with ASDH, and it was easy to promote. In the future, large sample and multicenter prospective studies are necessary to complement and identify the results.

TI Intraoperative Neurophysiologic Monitoring for Lumbar Intradural
   Schwannomas: Does It Affect Clinical Outcome?
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Intraoperative multimodal neuromonitoring; Schwannomas; Spinal surgery;
   Spinal tumor; Total laminectomy; Unilateral minimal invasive laminectomy
AB OBJECTIVE: Intraoperative multimodal neuromonitoring (IONM) is considered valuable for the early detection and prevention of any neurologic compromise during spine surgery. It has also become the standard of care at many institutions to improve the surgical outcome and be a safety net for both clinical and medicolegal concerns.
   METHODS: Our experience and outcomes in 46 consecutive cases of lumbar intradural schwannoma resection were reviewed with respect to clinical outcomes and patient safety, before and after the integration of IONM into our clinical practice.
   RESULTS: Total surgical resection of schwannomas in the lumbar spine led to improved health-related quality of life for patients. The standard technique for microsurgical resection of schwannomas requires identifying and resecting the fiber of origin for the schwannoma, guided with triggered electromyographic monitoring. However, whether this changed the surgical strategy, because spinal roots that gave rise to the schwannoma were frequently found to be nonfunctional during surgery, remains unclear. In our series of 46 patients, we did not recognize any additional motor deficit after the surgery, regardless of the use of IONM.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite our analysis proving no difference in clinical outcomes with or without the use of IONM during surgical excision of lumbar schwannomas, we still prefer using IONM as a standard approach. It adds to the confidence and ease of mind of the surgeon during resection and also provides valuable data in cases of medicolegal disputes. However, it comes with an increased cost and lengthened surgical procedure.

   THERAPIES
AB BACKGROUND: Meningioma is the most common primary brain tumor. It is graded as I, II, or III based on the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of central nervous system tumors. Meningiomas, especially those classified as grade II-III, have an aggressive history and a high recurrence rate. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a small subset of tumor cells and are considered to be involved in tumor initiation, growth, and/or recurrence. To date, the CSCs of meningioma have not been well established.
   METHODS: We assessed 51 grade II/III meningiomas using immunohistochemistry to determine if a correlation exists with the prognosis by investigating CD133, CD44, and nestin expression as possible CSC markers and age, gender, initial WHO tumor grade, Simpson grade, and the use of adjuvant radiation therapy.
   RESULTS: The median overall survival was 7.1 years, and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.8 years. Univariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression revealed a negative correlation between CD133 and nestin expression and PFS (P = 0.0176 and P = 0.0138, respectively), and high expression of CD44 demonstrated a tendency toward a shorter PFS (P [0.0563), as did the initial WHO grade and Simpson grade found at the initial operation (P = 0.0166 and P 0.0333, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed relevance between CD133 and nestin expression and PFS.
   CONCLUSIONS: CD133 and nestin expression, initial WHO grade and Simpson grade were associated with PFS in patients with grade II/III meningioma. These findings might suggest that these molecules are representative of CSCs in meningioma regarding the aspect of clinical course.

ID CELL APOPTOSIS; CYTOKINES
AB OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate neuroprotective effects of tocilizumab on spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Our study design was an experimental rabbit spinal cord I/R injury model, and the setting was at the Animal Research Laboratory, Necmettin Erbakan University, Meram School of Medicine, Konya, Turkey.
   METHODS: Twenty-four adult New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into 3 groups: Group 1, control group (n = 8); Group 2, I/R group, and Group 3 (n = 8) I/R injury D tocilizumab (4 mg/kg, ip) treatment group. Spinal cord I/R injury repair was performed by infrarenal aortic cross clamping.
   On neurologic evaluation, spinal cord tissue plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 10 (IL-10) levels were analyzed. Spinal cord neuronal damage score and apoptotic cell count were also investigated.
   RESULTS: I/R injury significantly increases the plasma and spinal cord tissue TNFa, TOS, TBARS, and IL-6 levels and decreases the plasma and spinal cord tissue TAS and IL-10 levels. Tocilizumab treatment significantly reduces the plasma and spinal cord tissue TNF alpha, TOS, TBARS, IL-6 levels and increases plasma and tissue TAS and IL-10 levels.
   I/R injury significantly increases spinal cord neuronal damage score and apoptotic cell count. Tocilizumab treatment significantly reduces spinal cord neuronal damage score and apoptotic cell count. Neurologic examination scores at 24, 48, and 72 hours were significantly better in the treatment group when compared with the I/R group.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study shows significant neuroprotective effects of tocilizumab on rabbit spinal cord I/R injury.

   EXTENT; GLIOMAS; SURVIVAL; TRACTS
AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In view of the few large prospective studies available on the role of preoperative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and the potential of DTI in showing the relationship between tumor and white matter tracts, we studied the role of preoperative DTI in planning a safe surgical corridor, predicting the neurologic and surgical outcome and tumor characterization in supratentorial intra-axial brain tumors.
   METHODS: We included 128 cases. Preoperative neurologic status and tumor volume were assessed. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based surgical plan was decided and reviewed for changes after DTI (site of corticotomy or limit of resection) by senior faculty of neurosurgery and neuroradiologist. Tracts were classified as displaced, infiltrated, or disrupted. Postoperative neurologic and surgical outcome was assessed along with evaluation of association of DTI with tumor type.
   RESULTS: DTI-based change in surgical corridor was seen in 60 patients (47%). Sixty-six patients harbored low-grade gliomas, 48 had high-grade gliomas, and 14 had metastastic lesions. Resectability (maximum safe resection) was higher in patients with displaced fibers and lower in those with disrupted/infiltrated fibers, which was statistically significant. Fewer patients had neurologic deterioration in the displaced category (7.1%) compared with the disrupted/infiltrated category (13.9%). Although no significant association could be established between neurologic outcome and fiber type, displaced fibers were associated mainly with low-grade glioma (71%), whereas disrupted/infiltrated fibers were associated mainly with high-grade glioma (66%); this correlation was significant.
   CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative DTI is a landmark tool for planning a safe surgical corridor and predicting the tumor type along with neurologic and surgical outcome of patients.

ID AXIAL ROTATION; SPINE
AB BACKGROUND: To investigate changes of oblique corridor in patients with lumbar degenerative scoliosis and determine proper working angle with respect to the direction of vertebral axial rotation during the oblique lumbar interbody fusion procedure.
   METHODS: The distance of oblique corridor and the rotational angle of the left or right apex group were measured on axial T2 magnetic resonance images and then compared with those of the propensity score-matched control group.
   RESULTS: Fifty-five patients of the left apex group and 57 patients of the right apex groupwere compared with the equal number of patients of the propensity score-matched control group. The distance of oblique corridor in the left apex group was shorter than that in the control group at the levels of L1-2 and L2-3. In contrast, the distance of oblique corridor in the right apex group was longer than that of the control group at the level of L2-3. Patients of the left apex group showed the vertebral body rotating to the left side from L1-2 to L5-S1, whereas in the right apex group, the vertebral body rotated to the right side at the levels of L1-2, L2-3, and L3-4.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the left apex group, the oblique corridor was decreased from psoas overlap, and coupled axial rotation to the left side might increase the risk of contralateral nerve root injury during orthogonally working. Thus, surgeons should pay attention to the state of coupled vertebral axial rotation of lumbar degenerative scoliosis for the oblique lumbar interbody fusion procedure.

   CONTRACTILITY; ASSOCIATION; EFFICACY; INDEX
AB BACKGROUND: Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia, involuntary detrusor contractions (IDCs), and poor bladder compliance are common urodynamic findings in cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). There is little information regarding the role of a urodynamic study after decompression surgery for CSM.
   METHODS: Urodynamic study was performed before and 6 months after decompression of CSM. Japanese Orthopaedic Association score for cervical myelopathy and Neck Disability Index functional score were applied. International Prostate Symptom Score was applied in male patients, and 6-item Urogenital Distress Inventory was applied in female patients.
   RESULTS: Mean patient age was 61.3 years. Final follow-up was obtained in 17 of 32 patients. Neurogenic bladder was confirmed in 11 (64.7%) patients, with 7 patients having poor bladder compliance, 3 patients having IDCs, and 6 patients having detrusor sphincter dyssynergia. Poor bladder compliance was normalized in 4 of 7 patients. IDCs disappeared in 2 (phasic IDCs) of 3 patients and improved in 1 (terminal IDC) patient. Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia markedly improved in 4 of 6 patients. Bladder compliance in 17 patients was 45.52 +/- 23.71 before decompression surgery and 77.07 +/- 39.85 after decompression surgery (P = 0.004). Both Japanese Orthopaedic Association and Neck Disability Index scores improved (P = 0.007 and P = 0.001, respectively). International Prostate Symptom Score and 6-item Urogenital Distress Inventory were not changed 6 months after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neurogenic bladder could be partially controlled in patients with CSM after surgical decompression. The neurogenic component in the urodynamic study findings varied. Depending on the findings, further appropriate urologic treatments after neurologic decompression surgery should be considered.

AB BACKGROUND: Parasagittal and parafalcine (PSPF) meningiomas recur more frequently than other intracranial meningiomas owing to the difficulty in achieving gross total resection. The present study investigated the preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features for the prediction of progression/recurrence (P/R) in benign PSPF meningiomas with an emphasis on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values.
   METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the preoperative MRI features for the prediction of P/R in benign (World Health Organization grade I) PSPF meningiomas. Only patients who had undergone preoperative and postoperative MRI follow-up studies for >= 1 year were included. From October 2006 to December 2015, 48 patients with a diagnosis of benign PSPF meningioma were included (median follow-up period, 42.5 months). Of these 48 patients, 12 (25%) developed P/R (median time to P/R, 23 months).
   RESULTS: PSPF meningiomas in male patients, subtotal resection, large tumor diameter, high diffusion-weighted imaging signal, and lower ADC values or ratios were significantly associated with P/R (P < 0.05). The cutoff points of the ADC value and ADC ratio for the prediction of P/R were 0.83 3 10-3 mm(2)/second and 0.99, with an area under the curve of 0.82 and 0.83, respectively (P = 0.001). On multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, male sex and low ADC values (< 0.83 3 10-3 mm(2)/second) were high-risk factors for P/R, with a hazard ratio of 12.37 and 30.2, respectively (P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that lower ADC values and ratios predicted for significantly shorter progression-free survival (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: The preoperative ADC values and ratios for the prediction of P/R offer additional valuable information for the treatment planning for PSPF meningiomas.

AB BACKGROUND: In this study, we present our experiences on the feasibility of rescue permanent Solitaire stent placement for failed mechanical thrombectomy (MT) and our protocol to avoid ineffective stent placement.
   METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the data for consecutive patients admitted into the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University and 2 collaboration hospitals from August 2014 to May 2018 for emergency large artery occlusion. The baseline clinical characteristics and radiologic assessment, interventional data, clinical outcome, and angiographic follow-up data were assessed. Notably, we introduced our protocol for antegrade flow assessment before Solitaire stent detachment to ensure an effective stent implantation.
   RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (mean age, 68.1 years, mean preprocedural National Institute of Health Scale Score, 22.1) were included, in which 34 patients had anterior circulation large artery occlusion and 5 patients had posterior circulation large artery occlusion. The MT attempts ranged from 1-5 (3.6 on average). The mean onset-to-puncture time was 4.8 hours (ranging from 2.1-7.8 hours) and the mean procedure time was 87.4 minutes (ranging from 32-124 minutes). Modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2b-3 reperfusions were noted in all cases. The immediate, average postprocedure stenosis rate was 25.3%, and the average stenosis rate at the 3-month angiographic follow-up was 34.7% (data from 15 patients). Three patients died. Nineteen (48.7%) patients had good outcome (modified Rankin Scale, mRS <= 2) at the 3-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Permanent Solitaire stent placement might be a feasible therapy for patients with MT-failed emergency large artery occlusion. For a successful revascularization, careful antegrade flow assessment before stent detachment is critical.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the technical and 1-year clinical outcome in balloon-mounted versus self-expanding stenting for symptomatic severe stenosis of the middle cerebral artery combined with poor collaterals in China.
   METHODS: Ninety-one patients with severe middle cerebral artery atherosclerotic stenosis combined with poor collaterals were recruited in the study. Balloon-mounted stent or self-expanding stent were selected to treat patients following a guideline. The baseline characteristics, cerebral angiography, and outcomes were compared between the patients treated with balloon-mounted stent and self-expanding stent.
   RESULTS: The mean degree of stenosis was 85.5% +/- 6.37% in the balloon-mounted stenting group and 85.4% +/- 7.73% in the self-expanding stenting group before treatment (P = 0.930). A longer operative time occurred in patients treated with self-expanding stent than in those treated with balloon-mounted stent (96.7 vs. 68.6 minutes, respectively; P = 0.002). Patients with self-expanding stent had a higher rate of residual stenosis than those with balloon-mounted stent (67.3% vs. 38.9%, respectively; P = 0.014). The patients in balloon-mounted stenting group was less likely to have restenosis (6.1% vs. 26.5%, P = 0.019) and had a lower degree of stenosis (5.0% +/- 0.0% vs. 26.9% +/- 29.2%, P = 0.019) compared with patients in the selfexpanding stenting group. During the 1-year follow-up, the recurrence rate of ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, hemorrhage stroke, and death was not significantly different between the 2 groups (1/33 vs. 2/49, P = 0.804; 1/33 vs. 1/49, P = 0.776; 0/33 vs. 2/49, P = 0.240; 1/33 vs. 0/49, P = 0.220, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Balloon-mounted stents may have a shorter operative time and lower restenosis occurrence than self-expanding stents. No significant difference in 1-year outcome was observed between the 2 groups.

AB OBJECTIVE: In this study, we focused on the regulatory roles of miR-494 in the pathogenesis of intervertebral disk degeneration (IDD) and the related mechanism.
   METHODS: First, rat IDD models were established, and the expression levels of miR-494 in IDDs of the rats were examined. Next, human nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were cultured and transfected with miR-494 mimics and inhibitors, and the roles of miR-494 on the proliferation and apoptosis of cells were determined using MTT cell proliferation assay and flow cytometry methods. Furthermore, the targeting relationship between miR-494 and neuro-oncological ventral antigen 1 (NOVA1) was examined by dual luciferase reporter assay. Finally, the expression of NOVA1, Caspase-3, Bcl-2eassociated X protein (BAX), and B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) was examined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot methods.
   RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the expression of miR-494 was significantly upregulated in IDD rats. Moreover, transfection of miR-494 inhibitors induced a significant increase in the proliferation and marked decrease in the apoptosis of the degenerated human NP cells. Transfection of miR-494 mimics has shown the opposite effects. Furthermore, NOVA1 has been confirmed as a target of miR-494, and the expressions of NOVA1 were significantly downregulated in IDD rats. In addition, transfection of miR-494 inhibitors significantly decreased the expression of Caspase-3 and BAX and markedly increased the expression of NOVA1 and BCL-2. Transfection of miR-494 mimics has shown the opposite effects.
   CONCLUSIONS: miR-494 was upregulated in IDD, and miR-494 might regulate the proliferation and apoptosis of NP cells through targeting NOVA1.

AB PURPOSE: To assess the relationship between the ratio of C2-C7 Cobb angle to T1 slope (CL/T1S) and cervical alignment changes after laminoplasty.
   METHODS: 78 consecutive patients with cervical myelopathy who underwent laminoplasty were enrolled. All patients with preoperative and follow-up cervical spine lateral x-ray images available for review were recruited in this study. Imaging data included C2-C7 Cobb angle, T1 slope, and cervical sagittal vertical axis (cSVA). All patients were classified into low-ratio group (bottom 25% of CL/T1S), fair-ratio group (middle 50% of CL/T1S), and high ratio group (top 25% of CL/T1S) according to CL/T1S ratio. The recovery rate was calculated based on the Japanese Orthopedic Association score.
   RESULTS: The preoperative C2-C7 Cobb angle had significant correlations with the T1 slope (r=0.528). Kyphotic alignment changes in the group with a high ratio of CL/T1S was greater than that of the other 2 groups (P < 0.001). The incidence of postoperative kyphosis in the group with a low ratio of CL/T1S was higher than that of the other 2 groups (P < 0.001). There was no postoperative kyphosis in the fair-ratio group. The surgical outcome in the low-ratio CL/T1S group and the high-ratio CL/T1S group was poorer than that in the fair-ratio CL/T1S group (P = 0.005).
   CONCLUSIONS: The cervical alignment was kept well in the mid-range CL/T1S ratio group after laminoplasty. Patients with a high CL/T1S ratio were more likely to present with kyphotic alignment changes. Patients with a low CL/T1S ratio were more likely to have postoperative kyphosis.

AB BACKGROUND: The safety and efficacy of brain parenchyma biopsy during minimally invasive (MIS) intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) clot evacuation has not been previously reported. The objective of this study was to establish the safety and diagnostic efficacy of brain biopsy during MIS ICH clot evacuation and to validate the modified Boston criteria as a predictor of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in this cohort.
   METHODS: From October 2016 to March 2018, superficial and perihematomal biopsies were collected for 40 patients undergoing MIS ICH clot evacuation and analyzed by the pathology department to assess for various ICH etiologies. Additionally, the admission magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scan of each patient was analyzed and evaluated for the likelihood of a CAA etiology based on the modified Boston criteria. Student t test was used to analyze intergroup differences in continuous variables, and a 2-tailed Fisher exact test was used to determine intergroup differences of categorical variables, with significance set at P < 0.05.
   RESULTS: Two of the 40 patients (5%) experienced postoperative rebleed. Four of the 40 patients (10%) had evidence of CAA on biopsy. Patients with CAA on biopsy were older (P = 0.005) and had a higher prevalence of parietal lobe (P = 0.02) and occipital lobe (P = 0.001) hemorrhage. The modified Boston criteria had a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39.6%-100%) and a specificity of 72.2% (95% CI, 54.6%-84.2%) for predicting CAA on biopsy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Brain biopsy in MIS ICH clot evacuation is safe and allows for the diagnosis of various ICH etiologies.

AB BACKGROUND: For patients undergoing lumbar spinal surgery, many surgeons routinely perform laboratory tests within 3 days after surgery. However, few studies have reported the necessity for routine laboratory tests for patients with uncomplicated cases within 3 days after surgery.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients with lumbar degenerative disease who had undergone lumbar spinal surgery from May 2014 to May 2017. The perioperative patient information was recorded. The abnormal postoperative laboratory tests were recorded. Finally, the incidence and risk factors for patients requiring postoperative clinical treatment were analyzed.
   RESULTS: A total of 1915 patients were included in the present study. Postoperative laboratory tests had been ordered for 870 patients (45.43%). Of these patients, only a small proportion had required postoperative clinical intervention to treat abnormal serum hemoglobin (2.53%), albumin (1.95%), serum potassium (0.92%), or serum calcium (6.55%) levels. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that female gender and operative time were risk factors for the need for blood transfusion after lumbar spinal surgery. Age and operative time were risk factors for patients requiring albumin supplementation after lumbar spinal surgery. Finally, intraoperative blood loss and operative time were independent risk factors for patients requiring calcium supplementation after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the small number of postoperative clinical interventions for abnormal laboratory test results, we believe that the use of routine laboratory tests within 3 days after lumbar spinal surgery for patients with uncomplicated cases are unnecessary. Our results showed that operative time is a potential risk factor for the necessity for clinical treatment after lumbar spinal surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: Endovascular treated cerebral aneurysms have a greater recurrence rate compared with microsurgical clip ligation. Despite recent endovascular advances, microsurgical clip ligation might be the treatment of choice for certain previously endovascular treated recurrent aneurysms. We report on our single-center experience with 76 previously coiled and/or stent-coiled aneurysms.
   OBJECTIVE: To analyze the surgical and radiologic outcome after clipping of previous endovascular treated recurrent cerebral aneurysms.
   METHODS: Patients were retrospectively identified. Demographic data, aneurysm size, location, perioperative coil extraction, occlusion rate, and complication rate were recorded. Patients were divided into a previously coiled-only group (COG) and a previously stent-assisted coiled group (SAC).
   RESULTS: Seventy-five patients with 76 aneurysms were included. Sixty-nine patients were included in the COG, 7 patients in the SAC group. Complete or acceptable near-complete occlusion was obtained in 95% of patients in the COG and 57% in the SAC group. Two patients in the COG (2.9%) died postoperatively of a major stroke. One patient died of rehemorrhage after wrapping of an aneurysm. Minor complications occurred in 8.7%. In the SAC group, the mortality was 0%, with 1 major stroke (14.2%), 1 minor stroke (14.2%), and 1 cranial nerve palsy (14.2%). Intraoperative coil extraction and previous stent-assisted coiling were significant predictors of complication rate (P = 0.025 and P = 0.0036 respectively). Previous stent-assisted coiling was a significant predictor of incomplete occlusion (P = 0.036).
   CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgical clipping of previously endovascular treated recurrent aneurysms is an effective treatment with high obliteration rates. Previously stent-assisted coiling and intraoperative coil extraction are predictors of worse outcome and incomplete occlusion.

AB OBJECTIVE: To delineate the most recommendable treatment of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhages and the indication for surgery, its timing, and the best surgical technique to be adopted case by case.
   METHODS: Based on PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases, a systematic review of the literature was performed using as keywords the terms "spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage," "surgical management," "medical management," "supratentorial," and "infratentorial." Because of the highest level of evidence, only randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, and comparative cohort studies reported within the last 12 years were selected. An updated and evidence-based treatment algorithm was reported also.
   RESULTS: The search initially returned 255 articles. After application of the exclusion criteria, only 19 studies were selected. According to the site and volume of the hematoma, admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and progressive neurologic decline, specific subgroups were identified. Surgery must be considered in patients with an admission GCS score ranging between 5 and 12 and a hematoma volume >30 mL. The best time-window has been reported to be 7-24 hours after ictus. Endoscopic surgery is recommendable for patients with a supratentorial hematoma >60 mL and with a poor GCS score (4-8). Alternative techniques, such as minimally invasive puncture and thrombolysis, may be considered for deeper hematoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Careful selection of patients eligible for surgery is mandatory. The optimal timing falls into a time-window ranging between 7 and 24 hours after ictus. Minimal invasive techniques are valuable surgical options for patients in a poor GCS score or harboring large deep-seated hemorrhages.

AB OBJECTIVE: It is difficult to completely comprehend the anatomy of the structures surrounding the paraclinoid region before aneurysm and tumor treatment therein. When treating paraclinoid aneurysms, it is important to determine the location of the aneurysm as intradural or extradural. Thus, accurate prediction of the position of the distal dural ring (DDR) is necessary. To this end, we focused on the falciform ligament (FL), which is easily visualized on images based on its anatomic features. We measured the distance between the FL and the DDR in patients undergoing paraclinoid aneurysm operations.
   METHODS: Between January 2017 and July 2018, 15 patients who underwent clipping for paraclinoid aneurysm treatment were retrospectively identified. The distance between the FL and the DDR was measured using a microscale at the time of the operation.
   RESULTS: The patients comprised 14 women and 1 man. The mean aneurysm diameter was 7.29 +/- 2.21 mm and the median size was 6.5 mm. Eleven of the aneurysms were on the left and 4 were on the right side. The mean distance between the FL and the DDR was 3.50 +/- 0.17 mm and the median distance was 3.50 mm. The distance between the FL and the DDR was almost the same across cases (3.5 mm).
   CONCLUSIONS: The position of the FL can be easily predicted using preoperative three-dimensional computed tomography angiography based on its anatomic features. In this study, the DDR was located 3.5 mm proximal to the FL along the internal carotid artery. This information is useful for predicting the position of the DDR.

AB BACKGROUND: In many cases in which bifrontal craniotomy is performed, the frontal sinus is opened, and postoperative complications occur. Various methods to close the frontal sinus have been reported. However, all these methods require skill to perform and take time. The aim of this study was to report results obtained with closure of the frontal sinus using polymethyl methacrylate, which is a simpler method.
   METHODS: From December 2008 to June 2018, 122 patients with a ruptured anterior communicating aneurysm were transported to the authors' facility, and 52 patients consecutively underwent bifrontal craniotomy with opening of the frontal sinuses, which were then filled with polymethyl methacrylate.
   RESULTS: Mean follow-up period was 21.8 months; the longest follow-up was 116 months. No cerebrospinal fluid leakage or other complications were observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: The method of filling the frontal sinus with polymethyl methacrylate reported in this study was safe and had no complications. This method should be considered as a method of frontal sinus closure.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) are at risk of the development of chronic shunt-dependent hydrocephalus. However, identification of shunt-dependent patients remains challenging. We sought to develop a prognostic model to identify patients with aSAH at risk of chronic shunt-dependent hydrocephalus. In addition to the well-known prognostic variables, blood clearance in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces was considered.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data from 227 patients treated at our institution from January 2012 to January 2016. The outcome was ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement within 30 days after aSAH. The candidate prognostic variables were patient age, World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grade and Fisher grade, external ventricular drainage, ventricular and intracerebral hemorrhage, and interval to blood clearance in the peripheral/basal CSF spaces. Adjustment for multiple testing was performed. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used for model development. Bootstrapping was applied for internal validation. The model performance measures included indexes for explained variance (R-2), calibration (graphic plot, Hosmer-Lemeshow test), and discrimination (c-statistic).
   RESULTS: Of the 227 patients, 90 (39.6%) required a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The constructed prognostic model combined external ventricular drainage placement, the presence of ventricular blood, and the duration of blood clearance in the basal cisterns. The model performance was promising, with an R-2 of 33% (20% after bootstrapping), the calibration plot was adequate, the Hosmer-Lemeshow test result was not significant, and the c-statistic was 0.85 (0.84 as assessed after bootstrapping) indicating a good discriminating prognostic model.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our prognostic model could help identify patients requiring permanent CSF diversion after aSAH, although additional modification and external validation are needed. Interventions aimed at accelerating the clearance of blood in the basal cisterns might have the potential to prevent the development of chronic hydrocephalus after aSAH.

AB BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analyses for the treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage are necessary to determine health policy, treatment guidelines, and screening protocols for cerebral aneurysms. To perform these modeling studies, detailed cost data are necessary and are currently lacking.
   OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine detailed inpatient cost of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of our ruptured subarachnoid hemorrhage database was performed to identify consecutive patients between January 2013 and December 2015. Patients were searched by International Classification of Disease 9 diagnosis and procedure codes. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were acquired. The cost breakdown was compiled into a comprehensive itemized list encompassing all aspects of hospitalization. A mean cost based on resource used per patient was obtained.
   RESULTS: There were 269 patients treated, 209 were coiled and 60 were clipped. Mean age in the clipping group was 49 years and 55 years in the coil group (P = 0.006). Other patient demographics and clinical characteristics were found to be statistically similar for both groups. Total cost per patient for treatment and hospital stay was $74,192 for clipping and $85,553 for coiling (P = 0.06). Cost amplified with increasing Hunt and Hess grade in both clipping and coiling groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: The detailed cost information reported in this article can be used to help establish appropriate, standardized costs nationally by improving transparency. It can also help provide critical information necessary to develop cost-effective treatment algorithms and screening protocols.

AB OBJECTIVE: To report our experience of the management of 60 patients with craniopharyngioma with endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) and evaluate the feasibility and safety of EES for craniopharyngiomas.
   METHODS: The clinical data of 60 patients with craniopharyngioma who underwent EES between November 2014 and December 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. All patients had vascularized nasoseptal flaps, and the most recent 4 patients had "in situ bone flaps" for better skull base reconstruction. Visual improvements, tumor resection extents, recurrence rates, endocrine functional changes, and surgical complications were evaluated.
   RESULTS: The resection rates were as follows: gross total, 68.3% (41 patients); near total (> 95% of tumor removed), 15% (9 patients); subtotal (>= 80% of tumor removed), 10% (6 patients); and partial (partial resection <80% of tumor removed), 6.7% (4 patients). Fifty-two patients presented with visual impairment; of these, 46 (88.5%) improved or returned to normal after surgery. Regarding the 32 patients with hypopituitarism before surgery, pituitary function was unchanged in 15 (46.8%), improved or normalized in 4 (12.5%), and deteriorated in 13 (40.6%). Eleven patients (18.3%) suffered from diabetes insipidus before treatment, and 27 more patients had this condition after surgery. Twenty-two patients had hyposmia postoperatively, and 17 patients experienced significant weight gain. Four patients had recent memory loss, and 2 of them had a temporary recent mental disorder. Three (5%) patients had cerebro-spinal fluid leakage after surgery. Three patients (5%) contracted meningitis and were cured with antibiotic treatment. One patient showed recurrence by magnetic resonance imaging re-examination, at the mean follow-up time of 22 months (range, 8-45 months; standard deviation, 11 months).
   CONCLUSIONS: EES can provide surgeons with excellent exposure and can achieve a high extent of removal of most craniopharyngiomas, even those with intraventricular extensions, In our view, vascularized pedicled septal flaps and in situ bony flaps were used in skull base reconstruction.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate ventral skull base lesion recurrences along surgical access pathways attributed to iatrogenic seeding.
   METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed searching for recurrence of ventral skull base lesions attributed to iatrogenic implantation. Studies were assessed for level of evidence. Primary intervention, pathology, and other clinical factors were reported following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines.
   RESULTS: Among 69 patients with recurrent skull base lesions attributed to seeding, the most common pathologies were craniopharyngioma (52.2%), chordoma (33.3%), adenocarcinoma (4.3%), adenoid cystic carcinoma (2.9%), and squamous cell carcinoma (2.9%). Median time to recurrence was 36 months. Time to recurrence was significantly longer for craniopharyngiomas than for chordomas (42 months vs. 24 months, P <= 0.05). Surgical approaches included craniotomy (62.0%), transseptal (11.3%), transfacial (12.7%), and transpalatal (4.2%). Mean time to recurrence after craniotomy was 69 months. Endoscopic/endoscopic-assisted approaches were used in 5 cases (7.0%). Commonly reported recurrence sites included subarachnoid (29.6%), dura (21.1%), incision (12.7%), septum (7.0%), and ethmoid sinuses (4.2%).
   CONCLUSIONS: The potential for iatrogenic tumor seeding exists for numerous skull base lesions, most notably craniopharyngioma and chordomas. Routine surveillance may be necessary owing to significant latency intervals to ectopic recurrence. Although transnasal endoscopic techniques have been extensively employed in recent decades, only a handful of reported cases involve lesions originally treated with this approach. Further direct comparison of traditional approaches with endoscopic approaches may be invaluable in further elucidating the role of surgical technique in tumor implantation and recurrence.

AB BACKGROUND: Lumbar pyogenic spondylodiscitis (LPS) is still a tangled problem in its management, especially with increasing rates of cases who underwent different spinal procedures and in patients with chronic medical disease. One-stage posterior direct transforminal lumbar thorough debridement of septic lesion, decompression, and spondylodesis (TLTDDS) are the main goals in treatment of complicated LPS without additional morbidity of anterior surgery. This is a retrospective assessment of the clinical, laboratory, functional, and radiologic outcomes in 25 patients with LPS who underwent the TLTDDS procedure.
   METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with complicated LPS were treated surgically by TLTDDS surgery from January 2014 to August 2017. Complete records of 25 patients were available for evaluation. All patients were examined clinically for back or leg pain using a visual analog scale (VAS) and neurological assessment by the American Spine Injury Association. Perioperative outcome and complications were documented. All patients were serially followed up between 12 and 32 months as regard pain (VAS), functional status by Kirkaldy Willis criteria, and Oswestry disability index, laboratory, and radiologic outcomes (angle of segmental kyphosis, lumbar lordosis correction, and fusion criteria).
   RESULTS: Definitive solid bony fusion was seen between 6 and 14 months, except in 3 cases, which showed probable fusion. There was significant improvement in VAS, American Spine Injury Association index, laboratory investigations, and Oswestry disability index. One patient (5%) had transient neurological deficit, which resolved completely within 2 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: TLTDDS surgery is an effective procedure in the treatment of symptomatic LPS and allows abscess evacuation with adequate neural decompression, segmental kyphosis correction, and functional improvement.

AB OBJECTIVE: Placing of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) is one of the most common procedures performed by neurosurgeons. Surgical revision of VPS is a significant cause of patient morbidity and mortality. This study was aimed to provide an analysis of factors related to VPS failures in the first 30 postoperative days in a pediatric cohort.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 83 pediatric patients (<18 years old), shunted for the first time at a referral care center, between January 2012 and December 2016. Univariate analysis was used to detect potential predictors of VPS failures within the first 30 postoperative days and in the first 6 months of follow-up. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to examine the occurrence of VPS failures over time.
   RESULTS: During the first 30 postoperative days, VPS failures occurred in 21 patients (25.3%). Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (odds ratio [OR], 4.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.44-13.48), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) alterations (OR, 5.11; 95% CI, 1.37-19.1), and previous external ventricular drain (EVD) (OR, 7.05; 95% CI, 1.18-41.8) were significantly associated with shunt failure during the first postoperative month. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed decreased shunt survival for patients with IVH, both during the first 30 days after surgery (P = 0.005, log-rank), and during the 6 months after surgery (P = 0.005, log-rank).
   CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that in pediatric patients, IVH was associated with VPS failure within the first 30 postoperative days and decreased shunt survival over time. Further larger prospective randomized studies are needed to better understand these results.

   PARTICULATE
AB OBJECTIVE: Transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESIs) have been increasingly used in the treatment of lumbar radicular pain resistant to conservative modalities. Although different steroids can be used at different doses, the minimally effective steroid dose should be used to reduce side effects. The present retrospective study examined and compared the efficacy of 40 mg and 80 mg of methylprednisolone in TFESIs.
   METHODS: We included 67 patients who had undergone unilateral L5-S1 TFESIs under fluoroscopic guidance in the present study. Assessments were conducted at baseline and at 1 hour, 3 weeks, and 3 months after the TFESIs. The Short-Form 36-item Health Survey, Numeric Rating Scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and Istanbul Low Back Pain Disability Index were used as outcome measures.
   RESULTS: The present study evaluated 33 patients who had undergone TFESIs with 40 mg of methylprednisolone and 34 patients who had undergone TFESIs with 80 mg of methylprednisolone. Although no statistically significant differences were found between the 2 groups' outcome measures, both groups showed significant improvements in pain, disability, and quality of life at 3 weeks and 3 months after treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: TFESIs with 40 mg and 80 mg are effective for the treatment of pain that results from lumbar disc herniation. They also positively affect patients' disability and quality of life. However, neither steroid dose was more efficient than the other dose. Therefore, we believe the smaller dose should be preferred to reduce the potential side effects of steroids.

AB OBJECTIVE: We studied the accuracy of the radiologic diagnosis of lateral ventricular masses in children (<20 years of age).
   METHODS: In this retrospective study, data were collected from children with lateral ventricular masses managed in our unit between 2001 and 2016. There were 43 patients (26 boys and 17 girls; mean age, 12.1 years; range, 8 months to 20 years). Magnetic resonance imaging was available for 36 patients, whereas in 7 patients only a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan was available. The images were read independently by 3 radiologists, who were blinded to the pathology. Two differential diagnoses were offered for each patient. The agreement between the 3 radiologists was calculated using the Fleiss kappa statistic.
   RESULTS: The common pathologic diagnoses were subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) (20.9%), low-grade astrocytoma (16.3%), high-grade astrocytoma (9.3%), choroid plexus papilloma (9.3%), and meningioma (9.3%). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the radiologic diagnoses were 62%, 96.7%, and 94.2%, respectively. Low-grade tumors such as low-grade gliomas, SEGAs, choroid plexus papillomas, and meningiomas were diagnosed with a high level of accuracy. High-grade gliomas, choroid plexus carcinomas, and other malignant neoplasms were difficult to diagnose on imaging. Cavernous angiomas were also difficult to diagnose. There was only fair agreement between the 3 radiologists (Fleiss kappa = 0.24).
   CONCLUSIONS: The pathologic spectrum of lateral ventricular tumors in children is wide, and identifying the pathology on imaging is difficult for malignant tumors. Benign tumors such as SEGAs, low-grade astrocytomas, and choroid plexus papillomas are relatively easier to diagnose. There is significant interobserver variability in the radiologic diagnosis of these tumors.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine outcomes of spinal anesthesia (SA) in high-risk patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery in whom general anesthesia (GA) was contraindicated.
   METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in Bansal Hospital, Bhopal, India. SA was achieved with a heavy spinal dose of bupivacaine administered in the sitting position. After assessing sensory level, patients were placed into prone position. Throughout surgery, hemodynamic parameters were monitored. At the end of surgery, patients were placed into supine position and taken out of the operating room for monitoring in the recovery room. Postoperatively, time spent in the post-anesthesia care unit, hemodynamic changes, incidence of nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, spinal headache, analgesic use, regression of sensory block, and length of hospital stay were documented. Patient and surgeon satisfaction was also assessed.
   RESULTS: The study included 18 high-risk patients with lumbar spine disease. Twelve patients were classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists IV, and 6 were classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists III. Ten patients underwent microdiscectomy, and 8 patients underwent canal and lateral recess decompression. None of the patients had anesthetic or surgical complications. Postoperative pain relief was excellent. There were no incidences of postoperative vomiting or urinary retention. Only 2 patients (11.11%) developed nausea. Both surgeons and patients reported a high level of satisfaction. SA was 12% cheaper than general anesthesia.
   CONCLUSIONS: SA is a safe, reliable, and satisfactory alternative to general anesthesia in high-risk lumbar spine surgeries. Postoperative morbidity and mortality can be reduced by SA and spinal analgesia techniques. SA allows good perioperative hemodynamic stability. It is also more cost-effective.

TI Sodium Fluorescein-Guided Surgery in Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors:
   First Experience in 10 Cases of Schwannoma
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Peripheral nerve sheath tumors; Schwannoma; Sodium fluorescein; Yellow
ID RESECTION; MICROSCOPE; BRAIN; GLIOMA; SERIES; ANGIOGRAPHY; FILTER
AB BACKGROUND: The intravenous application of sodium fluorescein (SF) for brain tumor surgery goes back to the late 1940s. The development of specific fluorophore filters significantly reduced the required dosage of SF and therefore diminished possible side effects. This study investigates the application of SF in benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs), concentrating on its feasibility during microsurgical removal.
   METHODS: The single-center study includes 10 consecutive schwannoma cases operated on between September 2016 and March 2017. Inclusion criteria were defined as age >= 18 years, preoperative magnetic resonance imaging with suspicion of schwannoma, and final histopathologic confirmation of schwannoma. Exclusion criteria were a history of intolerance to SF and renal insufficiency. The microsurgical part of each surgery was video recorded, and the collected material was retrospectively analyzed. Red, green, and blue values of various regions of interest set on tumor and normal nerve of each patient were evaluated using ImageJ, an open platform for scientific image analysis.
   RESULTS: Digital video analysis confirmed the intra-operative impression of increased fluorescence of the tumor in contrast with normal nerve tissue. Because the color yellow is predominantly a mixture of red and green, values of these colors were significantly increased in schwannomas compared with normal nerve tissue ( P = 0.0003 and P = 0.0023, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: SF reveals increased fluorescence in schwannomas compared with normal nerve tissue. Intraoperative differentiation of tumor and normal nerve tissue becomes possible using a low dose of SF (0.5-1 mg/kg). No side effects occurred. Secure microsurgical preparation is feasible during application of the YELLOW 560 nm filter.

TI Synchronous Development of Multicentric Malignant Peripheral Nerve
   Sheath Tumors: Institutional Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor; MPNST; Multicentric;
   Synchronous
ID PREVALENCE
AB BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are rare soft tissue sarcomas, with approximately 50% occurring in patients diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). NF-1 occurs in approximately 1/3000 individuals, and given that the lifetime prevalence of MPNST is estimated at 8%-13%, synchronous development of separate MPNSTs is plausible. We sought to report the incidence of synchronous MPNST in a cohort of pathology-proven cases since 1994.
   METHODS: Records since 1994 were queried and identified 192 patients with pathology-proven MPNST. Medical records of these patients were reviewed to search for patients with synchronous MPNSTs.
   RESULTS: Retrospective review of 192 patients treated for MPNST at our institution (including 71 patients with NF-1) revealed only 1 patient with synchronous MPNSTs. A 48-year-old woman with NF-1 presented with progressive right upper and lower extremity pain and radicular symptoms. Biopsies of right sciatic and median nerve lesions revealed high-grade MPNST, and she underwent radiotherapy and complete resection of both masses. Due to initial nonspecific biopsy results and patient preference, treatment of the median nerve lesion was delayed by 8 months. She did not have recurrence of her disease at the 18-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Synchronous development of MPNST is unusual, with an incidence of 1.4% in our cohort of NF-1 patients with MPNSTs. Given the reported incidence of synchronous MPNST, the rate of malignant transformation in NF-1 may be overestimated. However, heightened suspicion for malignant transformation should continue in patients harboring a diagnosis of MPNST.

ID INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; HYPOPLASIA; COILING; KINKING
AB OBJECTIVE: Vascular anatomic variations are very common in the population, but their coexistence with life-threating vascular malformations remains unclear. The objective of the study was to assess the correlation between the presence of anatomic variants of both carotid and main cerebral arteries and the occurrence of cerebral aneurysms.
   METHODS: We analyzed examinations of 194 patients who underwent computed tomography angiography of the head and neck between September of 2016 and November of 2017. The assessed parameters were: the variation of the common carotid arteries origin, hypoplasia or duplication of any of the main cerebral arteries, carotid artery kinking, and the presence of cerebral aneurysms.
   RESULTS: We found 5.7% of patients had a cerebral aneurysm. Hypoplasia of at least 1 main cerebral artery occurred in 34.5% of patients, with the most frequent being the vertebral artery (21.6%). Duplication of at least 1 main cerebral artery was detected in 2.6%. Cerebral aneurysms occurred more often together with hypoplasia (P = 0.041; OR = 3.175) or duplication (P < 0.001; OR = 18.500) of at least 1 main cerebral artery. In 7.2% of cases, the origin of common carotid arteries created a true bovine arch, and in 4.1% the so-called bovine arch. Patients with alternative variants of aortic arch branching were more likely to have cerebral aneurysms (P = 0.002; OR = 5.903). We found 27.3% of patients had internal carotid arteries affected by kinking. Carotid kinking did not predispose the patient to the formation of a cerebral aneurysm (P = 0.378).
   CONCLUSIONS: There is an evident correspondence between the presence of vascular anatomic variants (abnormal origin of the carotid arteries, hypoplasia, or duplication of the main cerebral artery) and the occurrence of cerebral aneurysms.

ID ANTERIOR CHOROIDAL ARTERY; PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION DEVICE; PARENT ARTERY;
   ANEURYSMS; DIVERTORS; PATENCY; EXPERIENCE
AB BACKGROUND: Flow diversion for treatment of intracranial aneurysms frequently necessitates covering adjacent branch vessels. Although branch vessel occlusion is common, associated clinical deficits are rare. It has been hypothesized that clinically silent branch vessel occlusion is due to underlying collateral circulation. To study the role of collateral circulation in covered branch vessel occlusion, we assessed collateral vessels and altered branch vessel flow on transfemoral catheter angiography in patients undergoing flow diversion of intracranial aneurysms.
   METHODS: Angiograms obtained before treatment, immediately after treatment, and during follow-up were evaluated for branch vessel flow patterns and associated collateral circulation in a consecutive retrospective cohort of 84 patients from 2011 to 2017 with branch vessel coverage related to aneurysm flow diversion using the Pipeline embolization device.
   RESULTS: We identified 142 branch vessels covered by the Pipeline device construct for treatment of 89 aneurysms, predominately in the anterior circulation (>90%). Collateral circulation was observed in approximately one third of these vessels and was associated with diminished (P < 0.001) or absent (P < 0.001) flow on follow-up angiography. Only 2 of 80 terminal branch vessels (no collaterals) were occluded, and these occurred in a patient with Pipeline device construct thrombosis. Altered branch vessel flow was not associated with vascular risk factors, treatment technique, or outcome measures, including new or worsening neurologic deficit.
   CONCLUSIONS: Altered flow in branch vessels covered during flow diversion reflects underlying collateral circulation and is not associated with downstream ischemic deficits.

DT Article
DE IV drug abuse; Spinal decompression; Spinal fusion; Spinal infection
ID VERTEBRAL OSTEOMYELITIS
AB OBJECTIVE: Recent population-level increases in intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) may contribute to incidence of spinal infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate national trends of spinal infections and evaluate effect of IVDA on outcomes in operative management of spinal infection.
   METHODS: Using the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample database for 2002-2014, all patients undergoing spinal decompression or fusion for treatment of spinal infection were evaluated. Inpatient outcomes included length of stay, total cost, complications, discharge to facility, reoperations, and inpatient mortality. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to compare patients with IVDA and patients without IVDA.
   RESULTS: A total of 60,964 patients undergoing surgical management of spinal infection were identified. Number of surgically managed spine infections increased from 2002 to 2014 (P < 0.0001). Proportion of surgically managed spine infections associated with IVDA increased from 3.3% in 2002 to 14.0% in 2014 (P < 0.0001). IVDA was associated with increased hospital length of stay (odds ratio = 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-1.45; P < 0.0001) and greater total charges (odds ratio = 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.29; P < 0.0001). No other significant differences between groups were noted.
   CONCLUSIONS: From 2002 to 2014 in the United States, the incidence of operatively treated spine infections increased 227.9%, and the proportion of cases associated with IVDA significantly increased. Patients with IVDA had a longer mean length of stay and increased inpatient cost of care but were not at increased risk for complication, reoperation, or mortality. These findings are important for surgeons, internists, hospitals, and insurers to ensure proper resource allocation in treating these at-risk patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine association between electrolyte disturbances and mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.
   METHODS: Medical records of patients with severe traumatic brain injury and Glasgow Coma Scale score <8 and electrolyte alterations were reviewed in a retrospective cohort study. Electrolyte levels were analyzed to establish an association between patients who died and patients who survived. Bivariate analysis was performed using chi(2) test with a statistical reliability of 95% for categorical variables. Analysis for electrolyte changes to determine association with mortality was performed using chi(2) test with multiple comparisons. Logistic regression was performed between the electrolyte alterations and their association with mortality. The reliability of statistical tests was 95%.
   RESULTS: There was a significant relationship between hypochloremia and increased risk of mortality in 23.1% of deceased patients (P = 0.03). Furthermore, there was a significant correlation with age (P < 0.01) and with the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation APACHE II (P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Hypochloremia could be an important prognostic factor to determine mortality risk and to improve treatment in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.

AB BACKGROUND: Surgery of lesions within the atrium of the lateral ventricle remains a challenging procedure because of the deep location and the relationship to vascular structures. The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of tractography to evaluate the position of white matter tracts located along the course of the surgical access to trigonal and peritrigonal lesions.
   METHODS: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was acquired in 19 patients. All patients underwent surgical resection of brain tumors. Pre- and postoperative clinical conditions were evaluated by a neurosurgeon, using the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale. The corticospinal tract, optic radiation, and arcuate fasciculum were reconstructed because of their location close to the trigonal region. Two neurosurgeons were asked to assess the surgical approach with and without tractography.
   RESULTS: According to the tractographic reconstructions, the surgical access was chosen from the middle temporal gyrus in 12 patients (63%) and the posterior parietal gyrus in 7 patients (37%), leading to an a priori change in the surgical approach in 14 patients (73%). Six patients (31%) showed new postsurgical transient symptoms, whereas in 2 patients (10%) the deficits were permanent. After 30 days, the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale evaluation showed an improvement or a substantial stability of symptoms in 90% of cases. In 2 patients, a worsening of 30% of clinical performance was appreciable.
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of DTI in preoperative planning of trigonal and peritrigonal lesions may help in description of the best surgical approach for patient; this technique allows to reach the tumors, saving the white matter tracts, when it is possible.

AB OBJECTIVE: The pedicled nasoseptal flap (NSF) is the widely accepted reconstructive technique of choice for repair of larger skull base defects after endoscopic endonasal approaches. There is a dearth of literature examining the decision-making process regarding flap harvest. The objective of this study is to evaluate preoperative characteristics that predict the use of NSF reconstruction after endoscopic transsphenoidal resection of pituitary tumors.
   METHODS: In this retrospective case control study, demographic, clinical, imaging, and procedural details were gathered on all patients undergoing endoscopic transsphenoidal pituitary adenoma resection at a single academic center since January 2009. Characteristics were compared for patients receiving an NSF and those not undergoing NSF repair. A multivariate model that best predicted the use of an NSF was built and a risk score was developed.
   RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-eight patients were included, and 39 underwent NSF placement. Tumor size and anatomic characteristics were the predominant factors that significantly differed between cases and controls. Patients with transsellar tumor extension had 6.3 higher odds of requiring NSF, each millimeter increase in tumor height on coronal T1 magnetic resonance imaging increased the odds of NSF use by 1.2. The flap risk score (FRS) is calculated by adding tumor height (mm) to 6 if there is transsellar extension. At an FRS of >35, the FRS is 87% specific and 85% sensitive for flap placement.
   CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative imaging characteristics can predict NSF use. The FRS can be applied by surgical teams and referring physicians to determine which patients are more likely to undergo NSF repair.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to understand the clinical and demographic factors influencing the overall survival (OS) of patients with spinal ependymoma and to predict the OS with machine learning (ML) algorithms.
   METHODS: We compiled spinal ependymoma cases diagnosed between 1973 and 2014 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry. To identify the factors influencing survival, statistical analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression model. In addition, we implemented ML algorithms to predict the OS of patients with spinal ependymoma.
   RESULTS: In the multivariate analysis model, age >= 65 years, histologic subtype, extraneural metastasis, multiple lesions, surgery, radiation therapy, and gross total resection (GTR) were found to be independent predictors for OS. Our ML model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-0.75) for predicting a 5-year OS of spinal ependymoma and an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.80-0.83) for predicting a 10-year OS. The stepwise logistic regression model showed poorer performance by an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.70-0.72) for predicting a 5-year OS and an AUC of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.73-0.77) for predicting a 10-year OS.
   CONCLUSIONS: With SEER data, we reaffirmed that therapeutic factors, such as surgery and GTR, were associated with improved OS. Compared with statistical methods, ML techniques showed satisfactory results in predicting OS; however, the dataset was heterogeneous and complex with numerous missing values.

TI Dural Artery from Supraclinoid Internal Carotid Artery to Anterior
   Clinoid Process: Origin, Course, and Clinical Implications
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Anterior clinoid process; Dural blood supply; ICA branches; Meningioma;
   Supraclinoid ICA
ID MENINGIOMAS
AB BACKGROUND: Dura of the anterior clinoid process (ACP) is presumably supplied by the ophthalmic and external carotid artery branches. There is a less recognized artery described by Yasargil that arises directly from the supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) and supplies the ACP dura. We studied the origin and course of this direct branch in patients in whom the carotid cistern was dissected for lesions not involving the carotid cistern and ACP dura. The management implications of this arterial twig have been described.
   METHODS: Thirty patients operated through the transsylvian route for suprasellar lesions were included. The arterial branch from the supraclinoid ICA to the clinoidal dura was dissected and studied under high magnification.
   RESULTS: A thin solitary artery could be delineated in 21 patients. In 14 patients, it originated from the dorsomedial surface of the ICA at its bifurcation close to the A1 origin. In the remaining 7, it was seen arising from the dorsomedial surface of the ICA, 2-4 mm proximal to bifurcation. The artery coursed from medial to lateral and pierced the clinoidal dura, 1-3 mm lateral to the entry of the carotid artery. The artery had no branches.
   CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge of this arterial twig to the clinoidal dura is important as this supply may be responsible for feeding the tumor arising from the dura arising from the anterior clinoid, making preoperative embolization impossible. In addition, the tumor may grow along with this vessel and infiltrate the adventitia of the ICA at the origin of this vessel.

AB BACKGROUND: The benefits of multiple interventions on the recurrence of high-grade gliomas are renowned. However, the real effect of repeated operations on the survival parameters does not seem to have been assessed. The aim of the present study was to determine whether reoperation for selected patients is safe and feasible.
   METHODS: A total of 78 patients with high-grade glioma had undergone surgery from 2004 to 2014. All the patients had met the following inclusion criteria: American Society of Anesthesiologists score 1-3, Karnofsky performance scale score > 60, and reintervention >= 4 months after the first surgery. The following parameters were evaluated: overall survival (OS) after diagnosis and reintervention, progression-free survival (PFS) after reintervention, number of surgical procedures, and OS of patients who had undergone surgery > 2 times. The results were compared with those of 78 patients with high-grade glioma who had undergone adjuvant chemotherapy.
   RESULTS: OS at 1 year was 100%. At 2 years, OS was 39.4% for those with glioblastoma and 58.3% for those with anaplastic astrocytoma. PFS after 6 months was 53.03% for glioblastoma and 75.0% for anaplastic astrocytoma. Of the 78 patients, 55 had undergone reoperation, with 15 requiring a third intervention and 8 requiring 4. Major complications developed in only 2 patients. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in complications or worsening neurological status.
   CONCLUSIONS: These data showed excellent outcomes in terms of OS and PFS and clinical conditions after multiple surgical procedures. Therefore, reintervention appears to be a feasible and safe solution for selected patients.

AB BACKGROUND: The factors associated with initial and delayed remission after growth hormone (GH)-secreting pituitary adenoma excision have not been completely elucidated.
   METHODS: We recruited 185 consecutive patients who had undergone resection of GH-secreting pituitary adenomas from January 2013 to December 2014 and assessed their tumor characteristics and surgical outcomes. The criteria for initial or delayed remission (using the 2010 consensus criteria) were normalized insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels, GH levels <0.4 mu g/L with an oral glucose tolerance test, and/or random GH levels <1.0 mu g/L at or after the postoperative 3-month (PO3M) follow-up, without adjuvant therapy.
   RESULTS: Remission was achieved in 92 of 162 patients (56.8%) after surgery alone and was associated with a lower Knosp grade of 0-2 and lower postoperative day 1 GH level on multivariate regression analysis. A baseline IGF-1 index (IGF-1 level/upper limit of normal) of <2.835 predicted for initial remission at the PO3M follow-up (positive predictive value, 95.3%; negative predictive value, 36.6%; P < 0.001). The PO3M IGF-1 index was significantly lower in the delayed remission group than in the nonremission group. Furthermore, the former had had fewer invasive tumors (1.23 +/- 0.21 vs. 1.77 +/- 0.37 [9.52% vs. 76.47%]; P < 0.001). A PO3M IGF-1 index of <1.485 predicted for delayed remission during subsequent follow-up (positive predictive value, 84.6%; negative predictive value, 92.3%; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: A lower Knosp grade of 0-2 and lower postoperative day 1 GH level were independent predictors of surgical remission. The baseline IGF-1 and PO3M IGF-1 indexes might predict for initial and delayed remission, respectively.

   MALFORMATIONS; DECOMPRESSION
AB BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of ventral pathologic lesions of the craniovertebral junction and upper cervical spine is extremely difficult due to limited accessibility, as well as the difficulty of performing surgical manipulations in a deep, narrow wound in conditions of restricted surgical freedom and angle of attack.
   METHODS: In this article we present 2 clinical cases in which the transoral approach was used to treat ventral meningiomas of the craniovertebral junction. Endoscopic assistance and an original method of anterior atlantooccipital stabilization were used.
   RESULTS: Subtotal removal in the first case and complete removal of the tumor in the second case were achieved. In the first case, an unsuccessful attempt of anterior stabilization was made. In the second case, there were no indications for instrumentation (anterior or posterior) as local bone autograft fusion between the condyles and lateral masses of C1 was effectively carried out.
   CONCLUSIONS: Previously, the transoral approach garnered interest only from a historical point of view, but with technical progress it has acquired a "second life." Novel surgical techniques allow for a more radical resection of named tumors, as well as lower morbidity and invasiveness of the surgical procedures, which, in the long term, leads to lower complication rates.

AB BACKGROUND: Although reducing 30-day hospital readmissions is now a priority in neurosurgical quality improvement, postoperative emergency room (ER) visits have remained poorly understood, in particular, in populations with limited access to outpatient care. After endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery, the unique pathologic entities treated can engender a variety of surgical and metabolic complications-often dangerous, delayed, and nonspecific in presentation. We sought to characterize the causes and timing of ER visits-with or without readmission-in a socioeconomically disadvantaged population.
   METHODS: We reviewed all the patients undergoing ETS by our skull base team from 2009 to 2017 to determine their socioeconomic profile and causes of ER visits. For external validation, we compared our results with national data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program.
   RESULTS: Of the 229 patients, 35 (15.3%) had visited the ER within 30 days of discharge. Of these 229 patients, 21 (9.2%) were readmitted, and 109 (47.6%) were insured by Medicaid. The most common reasons for the ER visits were headache (8 of 35 [22.9%]), hyponatremia (7 of 35 [20.0%]), and epistaxis (5 of 35 [14.3%]). The most common cause for readmission was symptomatic hyponatremia (6 of 21 [28.6%]). The other reasons for readmission included meningitis (2 of 21 [9.5%]), adrenal crisis (2 of 21 [9.5%]), and cerebrospinal fluid leakage (1 of 21 [4.8%]). The average time to readmission was 10.9 days. According to the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, the 30-day readmission rate was 5.5%, of which 22.2% were for hyponatremia.
   CONCLUSION: Delayed hyponatremia accounts for a large proportion of ER visits and unplanned readmissions. Close follow-up with diligent, multidisciplinary care might reduce the number of ER visits and readmission in this population.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes of scoliosis correction with direct vertebral rotation (DVR) and without DVR (no direct vertebral rotation [N-DVR]) through meta-analysis.
   METHODS: MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched from the earliest available date of indexing through April 10, 2018, for studies evaluating outcomes of DVR and N-DVR in scoliosis. Two researchers performed the data extraction independently. Any discrepancies were resolved by a consensus.
   RESULTS: Seven comparative studies were identified. There were no significant differences between DVR and N-DVR for apical vertebral translation, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, coronal balance, sagittal balance, complication rate, and preoperative major Cobb angles. DVR was more effective than N-DVR for correction of thoracic Cobb angle (P = 0.02, weighted mean difference = -3.46 degrees [95% confidence interval, -5.57 degrees, -1.35 degrees]), lumbar Cobb angle (P < 0.0001, weighted mean difference = -4.37 degrees [95% confidence interval, -6.31 degrees, -2.42 degrees]), and apical vertebral rotation (P < 0.0001, weighted mean difference = -3.28 degrees [95% confidence interval, -4.85 degrees, -1.72 degrees]).
   CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed that postoperative thoracic Cobb angle, postoperative lumbar Cobb angle, and postoperative apical vertebral rotation were better with DVR compared with N-DVR. Further large multicenter studies will be necessary to substantiate these results.

Comparisons of data from the preoperative and final follow-up standing lateral lumbar x-rays, with the bilateral femoral heads, of the 2 groups were conducted using the following parameters: slip percentage (SP), lumbar lordosis (LL), pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt (PT), sacral slope, lumbosacral angle, slip angle (SA), and the L1 axis and S1 distance (LASD).
   RESULTS: The slip reduction rate (Delta SP) in the OPEN group was significantly higher than in the MIS group (67 +/- 34% vs. 37 +/- 51%, P = 0.018). The change of SA (Delta SA) in the OPEN group was significantly higher than in the MIS group (3 +/- 7 degrees vs. -3 +/- 5 degrees, P = 0.003). The change of LASD (Delta LASD) in the OPEN group was significantly lower than in the MIS group (-4 +/- 15 mm vs. 4 +/- 9 mm, P = 0.033). There were positive correlations between the preoperative SP and LASD, and Delta SA and the change of LL (Delta LL), and a negative correlation between DLL and the change of PT (Delta PT).
   CONCLUSIONS: For low-grade DS, open PLIF has a higher rate of slip reduction compared to MIS-TLIF, and significantly reduces LASD, therefore, it is more conducive to improving lumbar sagittal balance.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for residual and recurrent nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs) after surgery and the role of GKRS in the management of NFPAs.
   METHODS: Between January 2000 and December 2010, 204 patients with residual or recurrent NFPAs undergoing GKRS were enrolled in this study according to the inclusion criteria. The median age of the patients was 48 years (mean, 48 years; range, 14-79 years). The median tumor volume was 3.3 mL (mean, 5.2 mL; range, 0.3-26.4 mL). The median margin dose was 14 Gy (mean, 14 Gy; range, 9-18 Gy). The median maximum dose was 31 Gy (mean, 30 Gy; 20-40 Gy). The median duration of follow-up was 86 months (mean, 88 months; range, 12-213 months).
   RESULTS: Of these 204 patients, the latest follow-up magnetic resonance imaging studies showed tumor regression in 102 patients (50%), tumor stability in 81 patients (40%), and tumor enlargement in 21 patients (10%). The tumor control rate of this cohort was 90%. The cumulative progression-free survival at 3, 5, 8, 10, and 15 years was 97%, 95%, 92%, 92%, and 81%, respectively. Thirty-seven patients (18%) developed new-onset hypopituitarism, with 1 patient experiencing panhypopituitarism. Five patients (2.5%) presented with new or worsening visual dysfunction without tumor growth. No new cranial nerve dysfunction was shown and no second brain tumor was identified.
   CONCLUSIONS: GKRS provided high tumor control and a low complication rate in our long-term follow-up. We recommend that early GKRS should be considered the routine adjuvant treatment for residual NFPAs approximately 6 months after subtotal surgical resection.

AB BACKGROUND: Learning surgical anatomy of the petrous pyramid can be a challenge, especially in the beginning of the training process. Providing an easier, holistic approach can be of help to everyone with interest in learning and teaching skull base anatomy. We present the complex organization of petrous pyramid anatomy using a new compartmental approach that is simple to understand and remember.
   METHODS: The surfaces of the petrous pyramid of two temporal bones were examined; and the contents of the petrous pyramid of 8 temporal bones were exposed through progressive drilling of the superior surface.
   RESULTS: The petrous pyramid is made up of a bony container, and its contents were grouped into 4 compartments (mucosal, cutaneous, neural, and vascular). Two reference lines were identified (mucosal and external-internal auditory canal lines) intersecting at the level of the middle ear. The localization of contents relative to these reference lines was then described, and 2 methods of segmentation (the X method and the V method) were then proposed. This description was then used to describe middle ear relationships, facial nerve anatomy, and air cell distribution.
   CONCLUSIONS: This new compartmental approach allows a comprehensive understanding of the distribution of petrous pyramid contents. Dividing it into anatomic compartments, and then navigating this mental map along specific reference points, lines, spaces, and segments, could create a useful tool to teach or learn its complex tridimensional anatomy.

ID RISK CALCULATOR; POSSUM; SYSTEMS; COMPLICATIONS; SURVIVAL
AB BACKGROUND: Although chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is generally benign, long-term survival (LTS) after CSDH is poor in a significant subgroup. This dichotomy has been compared to fractured neck of femur. However, although early postoperative mortality (within 30 days of CSDH) is well recorded with CSDH and similar to fractured neck of femur (4%-8%), scant accurate data exist regarding early postoperative morbidity (POMB). POMB, which prolongs length of stay (LOS) after major nonneurosurgery, is associated with decreased LTS. One recent CSDH study suggested a POMB standard of 10% i.e., notably less than with fractured neck of femur (45%).
   METHODS: POMB was recorded in a novel prospective single-center cohort after CSDH. The POSSUM(Physiological and Operative Severity Score for Enumeration ofMortality and Morbidity), American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) score, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade were assessed as tools for potentially predicting POMB. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated.
   RESULTS: Early postoperative mortality (within 30 days of CSDH) occurred in 3 of 114 patients (3%). Seventy-one POMB events occurred in 54 of 114 patients (47%), with 27 of 54 (50%) having a Clavien-Dindo grade >= 2. Most POMBwas neurologic (n= 47/71, 66%). Age (P= 0.01), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (P = 0.001), Markwalder grade (P= 0.01), hypertension (P = 0.047), and/or >= 1 preexistent comorbidity (P = 0.041) were predictive. LOS (P = 0.01) and discharge modified Rankin Scale score (P < 0.001) were significantly associated. Predicted and observed POMB with POSSUM were significantly disparate (chi(2)= 15.23; P = 0.001): POSSUMarea under ROC (AUROC = 0.611) was also nondiscriminatory. ACS-NSQIP (chi(2) = 18.51; P < 0.001; AUROC = 0.629) and ASA grades (P= 0.25) were also nonpredictive.
   CONCLUSIONS: POMB was frequently disabling, mostly neurologic, and as frequent and diverse as with fractured neck of femur. POMB was significantly correlated with LOS and discharge modified Rankin Scale score. Surprisingly, POSSUM, ACS-NSQIP, and ASA grades were not predictive and would not aid consent. Simple parameters (age, Glasgow Coma Scale, Markwalder grade, hypertension, and/or >= 1 other comorbidity) were instead predictive. Longitudinal follow-up will determine whether POMB affects LTS. CSDH, like fractured neck of femur, is distinct.

AB BACKGROUND: Surgery for spontaneous primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains controversial. Previous surgical trials have primarily focused on short-term mortality while studies on long-term functional outcome are rare. We therefore conducted this retrospective study of long-term outcome on all ICH patients who underwent craniotomy at a single neurosurgical center during a 10-year period.
   METHODS: We included all patients >15 years of age who underwent evacuation of spontaneous ICH at Skane University Hospital between 2003 and 2012. Case fatality at 30 days, 1 year, and long-term follow-up (up to 10 years) were analyzed in relation to potential predictors of outcome. Long-term functional outcome was assessed in 2013 by telephone interview using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).
   RESULTS: Of 229 operated patients, overall case fatality was 20% at 30 days and 31% at 1 year. For patients with supratentorial ICH, the case fatality was 16% at 30 days and 27% at 1 year, and 29% at 30 days and 41% at 1 year for patients with cerebellar ICH. The most consistent independent predictors of mortality were preictal heart disease and level of consciousness on admission. Of 185 patients with long-term functional outcome available (median follow-up 6.14 years), 44 of them (24%) had a good outcome (mRS score 0-3) and 141 (76%) were severely disabled or dead (mRS score 4-6).
   CONCLUSIONS: The case fatality in our study was comparatively low, but most survivors lived dependently several years after surgery. Heart disease and level of consciousness were the most consistent predictors of mortality.

AB BACKGROUND: Head computed tomography (CT) with perfusion imaging has become crucial in the selection of patients for mechanical thrombectomy. In recent years, machine learning has rapidly evolved and found applications in a wide variety of health care tasks. We report our initial experiences with training a neural network to predict the presence and laterality of a perfusion deficit in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
   METHODS: CT perfusion images of patients with suspicion for acute ischemic stroke were obtained. The data were split into training and validation sets. A long-term, recurrent convolutional network was constructed, which consisted of a convolutional neural network stacked on top of a long short-term memory layer.
   RESULTS: Of the 396 patients, 139 (35.1%) had a right-sided perfusion deficit, 199 (50.3%) had a left-sided deficit, and 58 (14.6%) had no evidence of a deficit. The best model was able to achieve an accuracy of 85.8% on validation data. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated for each class, and an area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each class. For right-sided deficits, the AUC was 0.90, for left-sided deficits, the AUC was 0.96, and for no deficit, the AUC was 0.93.
   CONCLUSIONS: The field of machine learning, powered by convolutional neural networks for the task of image recognition and processing, has quickly developed in recent years. We constructed an artificial neural network that can identify and classify the presence and laterality of a perfusion deficit on CT perfusion imaging.

AB OBJECTIVE: To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to assess the safety and feasibility of a modified encephalo-galeo-duro-synangiosis operation in patients with atherosclerotic carotid artery occlusion.
   METHODS: Eight patients who had experienced new ipsilateral cerebrovascular events after the diagnosis of carotid artery occlusion were recruited. To facilitate extracranial-to-intracranial collateralization, 5 or 6 burr holes were made, and the dura mater and arachnoid were opened. The patients were closely monitored for complications and underwent conventional angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and 1 year of follow-up. After 10 years, the patients who were still alive were interviewed and assessed for functional outcomes and neurological status.
   RESULTS: No surgery-related adverse events were observed, apart from temporary headache and subcutaneous effusion. Four of six patients had developed an extracranial-to-intracranial collateral blood vessels on angiography, and these patients had no incident ischemic events during the follow-up period. During the long-term follow-up period (10 years), 3 patients had died. Of those living, 4 of the 5 patients reported total resolution of the symptoms, with no incident ischemic events. One patient still experienced disability from an ischemic stroke that occurred as a result of the 1-year follow-up angiography.
   CONCLUSIONS: Encephalo-duro-galeo-synangiosis for symptomatic carotid occlusion seems to be safe and feasible and might be able to induce extracranial-to-intracranial collaterals in patients with carotid artery occlusion. Further studies are needed to define the optimal therapeutic window and yield of burr hole surgery in the treatment of symptomatic carotid occlusive disease as an adjuvant to extracranial-intracranial bypass.

AB OBJECTIVE: Possible factors associated with bleeding from endoscopy-detected chronic subdural hematomas (CSDHs) have rarely been analyzed. We therefore evaluated intraoperative endoscopic findings to elucidate the clinical course and assess predictors of CSDH recurrence.
   METHODS: Altogether, 540 CSDHs were reviewed in this retrospective study. Six possible signs of bleeding were detected in the cavity: spotty bleeding on the outer membrane, hematoma clots, cerebral parenchymal suspension, stretched cortical vessels, intraluminal trabecular structures, and septa separating the cavity. We evaluated the association of each with the radiologic findings, endoscopic features, and interval from trauma to surgery and then assessed the correlation between each endoscopic feature and CSDH recurrence.
   RESULTS: Spotty bleeding, cerebral parenchymal suspension, and stretched cortical vessels occurred during every period. Hematoma clots exhibited a 2-peak pattern with significant resurgence during the chronic phase. Trabecular structures significantly increased 61 days after the trauma, reaching 71.2% of patients on day 91. Septa were found in the cavity in only 12.5% during the initial 30 days but subsequently increased significantly to 37.3%. At 2 months, an exacerbation stage was inferred. The multivariable analysis revealed that trabecular structures and residual septa were significant independent risk factors for recurrence. We opened most septa intraoperatively. Their recurrence rate was 7.5%, which is lower than has been previously reported.
   CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of the changes in the endoscopic findings and their association with recurrence was useful for clarifying the mechanism of CSDH enlargement, the risk of recurrence, and the potential for endoscopic surgery.

AB BACKGROUND: The Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) has been increasingly used for the treatment of posterior circulation aneurysms. The purpose of the present study was to examine the clinical and angiographic outcomes of patients with vertebrobasilar aneurysms treated with the PED.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of vertebrobasilar aneurysms treated with the PED at 4 highvolume neurovascular centers. Patient, aneurysm, and procedural data were collected, including perioperative and delayed complications. Aneurysm occlusion on followup imaging studies was defined as complete (100%), near-complete (>90%), or incomplete (<90%) occlusion.
   RESULTS: The cohort included 35 patients with 37 vertebrobasilar aneurysms who underwent 36 treatment sessions. Of the 35 patients, 10 were men (29%), and the mean patient age was 54.1 years (range, 32-75). Eight patients (23%) underwent urgent treatment because of a ruptured aneurysm (n = 6), brainstem perforator stroke (n = 1), or posttraumatic pseudoaneurysm (n = 1). Of the 37 aneurysms, 22 arose from the vertebral artery (59%) and 15 from the basilar artery (41%). Also, 19 were saccular aneurysms (51%), with a mean size of 7.7 mm (range, 1.7-38.0); 17 were fusiform aneurysms (46%), with a mean size of 11.0 mm (range, 4.3-34); and 1 was a 2.9-mm blister aneurysm. The overall procedural complication rate was 14% (5 of 36), including 3 neurologically symptomatic complications. At a mean follow-up period of 14 months (range, 3-59), 24 of 34 aneurysms (71%) were completely occluded and 29 of 34 (85%) were completely or near-completely occluded.
   CONCLUSION: Our results show that Pipeline embolization of vertebrobasilar aneurysms is associated with acceptable occlusion and complication rates.

AB OBJECTIVE: Catheter malposition represents one of the major causes of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt dysfunction. The usefulness of intraoperative fluoroscopy using skull landmarks has already been proved to decrease catheter malposition and surgical revision rates. After introducing intraoperative computed tomography (iCT) in our department, our objective was to evaluate the accuracy of this imaging modality to decrease cranial catheter misplacement compared with intraoperative fluoroscopy.
   METHODS: In our retrospective analysis of 152 patients, catheter placement was evaluated by iCT (n = 48) and biplane fluoroscopy (n = 57). A control group (n = 47) had no intraoperative imaging. Outcome measures included accuracy of ventricular catheter position, revision surgeries, and clinical outcomes.
   RESULTS: Ventricular catheter placement was accurate in 24/48 patients with iCT and 45/57 patients with fluoroscopy (P = 0.002) versus 23/47 patients in the control group. Sensitivity and positive predictive value for estimating optimal catheter position with iCT were 100% and 54%. The specificity and negative predictive value were 50% and 100%. After intraoperative revision, 4 catheters remained malpositioned in the iCT group, whereas the fluoroscopy group had none (P = 0.03); 2 of these 4 catheters were revised postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Fluoroscopy may be the method of choice to intraoperatively assess ventricular catheter positioning. In our experience, iCT shows a tendency to be more time consuming and, in the beginning, was not associated with a steeper learning curve. Another consideration was the significant higher radiation exposure per patient. iCT did not improve the accuracy of catheter placement and did not decrease early revisions for VP placement patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: To introduce anterior controllable ante-displacement fusion (ACAF), a new surgical technique, to treat multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy with spinal stenosis and compare ACAF with anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF).
   METHODS: Patients with multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy with spinal stenosis who underwent ACAF (36 cases) and ACCF (45 cases) from January 2016 to June 2017 were enrolled in this study. Japanese Orthopaedic Association score was analyzed before the operation and at each scheduled follow-up during the follow-up period after surgery to evaluate neurologic function. Clinical and radiologic outcomes and perioperative complications were analyzed.
   RESULTS: At the final follow-up, mean Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores of the 2 groups were significantly improved compared with preoperatively (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01). However, mean Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores between the 2 groups were not statistically significant (13.7 +/- 1.9 vs. 13.5 +/- 1.8, P = 0.66). Operative duration was longer and blood loss was greater in the ACAF group compared with the ACCF group. Overall occurrence of complications in the ACAF group was significantly lower compared with the ACCF group (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: ACAF has similar clinical and radiologic outcomes and fewer complications compared with ACCF in treatment of multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy with spinal stenosis. ACAF can be used as an alternative treatment for cervical stenosis.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate surgical outcomes of homogeneous spinal-shortening axial decompression (HSAD) for reoperation in pediatric patients with tethered cord syndrome.
   METHODS: Twenty consecutive pediatric patients (<= 18 years old, 7 boys, 13 girls) who underwent HSAD after untethering surgery between June 2012 and May 2015 were included. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association score and visual analog scale were used to evaluate preoperative and postoperative neurologic function and pain. The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnairee-Short Form and urodynamics were used to evaluate urinary function. The Rintala score was used to evaluate stool function.
   RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 13.4 +/- 3.6 years (range, 7 -18 years). The mean duration of follow-up was 31.2 +/- 12.7 months (range, 12-48 months). The Japanese Orthopaedic Association score was increased from 13.31 +/- 4.03 preoperatively to 19.15 +/- 4.17 at final follow-up (P < 0.01). The visual analog scale score was decreased from 5.25 +/- 1.78 preoperatively to 2.21 +/- 1.63 at final follow-up (P < 0.01). The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnairee Short Form score was decreased from 14.94 +/- 4.15 preoperatively to 7.63 +/- 4.40 at final follow-up (P < 0.01). All urodynamics parameters improved compared with before the operation. The Rintala score improved from 5.26 +/- 3.45 preoperatively to 12.32 +/- 3.43 at final follow-up (P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes of HSAD for revision surgery of tethered cord syndrome were satisfactory. HSAD improved neurologic function of patients significantly. HSAD could become an alternative surgical treatment of reoperation for tethered cord syndrome.

ID MICROVASCULAR DECOMPRESSION; POSTERIOR-FOSSA; MECHANISM
AB BACKGROUND: Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is caused by vascular compression of the facial nerve. The definitive mechanism of offending vessel formation remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore whether the anatomic and hemodynamic characteristics of the vertebrobasilar artery play a role in problematic vessel formation in HFS.
   METHODS: Imaging data of 341 patients with HFS who underwent microvascular decompression were reviewed retrospectively and compared with 360 control subjects. Hemodynamics of typical anatomic variations of the vertebral artery (VA) were analyzed using computational fluid dynamics software.
   RESULTS: Asymmetry of the left and right VAs was prevalent, and the left VA was the most dominant VA. A dominant VA was more prevalent in the HFS group than in the control group (P = 0.026). Left HFS had a significantly higher proportion of a left dominant VA, and right HFS had a significantly higher proportion of a right dominant VA (P < 0.001). Computational fluid dynamics models showed that angulation and tortuosity of vessels caused remarkable pressure difference between vascular walls of opposite sides. Dynamic clinical observations showed the mode of vessel transposition coincided with biomechanical characteristics.
   CONCLUSIONS: Anatomic variations and hemodynamics of the vertebrobasilar arterial system are likely to contribute to vascular compression formation in HFS.

AB BACKGROUND: The modified 5-item frailty index (mFI-5) is a concise comorbidity-based risk stratification tool that has been shown to predict the occurrence of adverse outcomes following various orthopedic surgeries.
   METHODS: The 2012-2016 American College of Surgeons - National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) dataset was used to identify patients undergoing an elective 1- to 2-level posterior lumbar fusion for degenerative lumbar pathology. The mFI-5 score was calculated based on the presence of the 5 co-morbidities: congestive heart failure within 30 days prior to surgery, insulin-dependent or noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pneumonia, partially dependent or totally dependent functional health status at time of surgery, and hypertension requiring medication. Multivariate analysis was used to assess the independent impact of increasing mFI-5 score on postoperative morbidity while controlling for baseline clinical characteristics.
   RESULTS: Increasing mFI-5 score versus mFI-5 = 0 was associated with higher odds of any complication (mFI-5 >= 2: odds ratio [OR] 1.45; mFI-5 = 1: OR 1.22), 30-day readmissions (mFI-5 >= 2: OR 1.46; mFI-5 = 1: OR 1.18), and nonhome discharge (mFI-5 >= 2: OR 1.80; mFI-5 = 1: OR 1.16). Higher mFI-5 score was significantly associated with increased risks of superficial surgical site infection, deep surgical site infection, unplanned reoperation, any medical complication, pneumonia, unplanned intubation, postoperative ventilator use, progressive renal insufficiency, acute renal failure, urinary tract infection, stroke, myocardial infarction, bleeding requiring transfusion, sepsis, and septic shock.
   CONCLUSIONS: Higher mFI-5 scores were associated with increased postoperative morbidity following elective 1- to 2-level posterior lumbar fusions.

   Peri-lead edema
ID HARDWARE-RELATED COMPLICATIONS; ELECTRODE; MANAGEMENT; TRANSIENT
AB OBJECTIVE: Postoperative peri-lead edema (PLE) is a poorly understood complication of deep brain stimulation (DBS), which has been described sporadically in patients presenting with profound and often delayed symptoms. We performed a prospective evaluation of patients undergoing DBS to determine the frequency of and identify risk factors for PLE.
   METHODS: Patients underwent DBS electrode placement by a single physician. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed approximately 6 weeks after the operation in asymptomatic subjects and analyzed for presence of PLE. All symptomatic subjects underwent MRI at the time of presentation. Data regarding index disease, preoperative medical issues, operative technique, and intraoperative variables were collected and statistically analyzed.
   RESULTS: A total of 191 leads were placed in 102 subjects; 15 patients (14.7%) demonstrated PLE. Seven patients (6.9%) presented with symptoms related to PLE, most often altered mental status or neurologic deficit. Many of the MRI findings were profound, with PLE sometimes several centimeters in diameter. No statistically significant difference was found between PLE-positive and normal subjects when analyzing multiple variables, including presence of vascular disease, hypertension, anticoagulant/antiplatelet use, electrode target, index disease, unilateral versus bilateral lead placement, number of brain penetrations, and presence or absence of microelectrode recording.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with postoperative PLE can present with severe symptoms or can be asymptomatic and go undiagnosed. Because of the delayed-onset potential, PLE may be more common than previously reported. No clear risk factors have been identified; therefore, further studies and increased clinical vigilance are paramount for improving comprehension and possible prevention of PLE.

ID OUTCOMES; SCIATICA; SURGEON
AB BACKGROUND: Transforaminal percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (TF-PELD) is a minimally invasive technique with high radiation exposure. The purpose of this study was to compare radiation exposure of ultrasound-guided TF-PELD with fluoroscopy-guided TF-PELD.
   METHODS: In this prospective randomized controlled clinical trial, 60 patients with lumbar disc herniation were enrolled and randomly assigned to 2 groups (30 cases in each group): the ultrasound-guided group or the fluoroscopy-guided group. The radiation exposure, fluoroscopy time, and visual analog scale score were recorded. The number of possible operations per year within the yearly occupational exposure limit (OEL) was calculated. We also recorded the adverse events to evaluate the safety of ultrasound-guided TF-PELD.
   RESULTS: In 30 patients from the ultrasound-guided group, the lumbar disc structure was clearly visible under ultrasound guidance. The effective dose to surgeons and radiation dose to patients were 1.7 +/- 0.4 and 25.2 +/- 4.9 mu Sv in the ultrasound-guided group and 9.0 +/- 2.5 and 127.4 +/- 27.1 mu Sv in the fluoroscopy-guided group (P < 0.05), respectively. The fluoroscopy time was 2.6 +/- 0.5 seconds in the ultrasound-guided group and 127.3 +/- 29.5 seconds in the fluoroscopy-guided group (P < 0.05). A surgeon with shielding devices could treat 5556 cases per year in the fluoroscopy-guided group before exceeding the OEL for whole-body radiation, whereas they could treat 29,412 cases in the ultrasound-guided group. No difference between groups was detected in postoperative visual analog scale score (P > 0.58). No serious adverse event was found in any patient.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-guided TF-PELD could decrease radiation exposure to surgeons and patients, without serious adverse events. It seems to be an acceptable alternative to fluoroscopy-guided TF-PELD.

TI Diagnosis and Management for Secondary Low- or Negative-Pressure
   Hydrocephalus and a New Hydrocephalus Classification Based on
   Ventricular Pressure
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Classification; Diagnosis; Low pressure hydrocephalus; Management;
   Negative pressure hydrocephalus; Ventricular pressure
AB BACKGROUND: Low-pressure hydrocephalus (LPH) and negative-pressure hydrocephalus (NegPH), secondary to traumatic brain injury, cerebral hemorrhage, tumor resection, and central nervous system (CNS) infection in adults, are seldom reported. They have not been recognized enough pathophysiologically in previous clinical practice. They used to have poor prognosis, and routine shunt surgery has unsatisfactory outcomes. The current classifications of hydrocephalus do not provide proper guidance for clinical practice, especially for LPH and NegPH.
   METHODS: Thirty-nine cases of LPH and NegPH were included from January 2013 to March 2018. Clinical features and image characteristics were reviewed. The prognosis of these patients were evaluated by Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) within 3 months after external ventricular drainage or ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt accepted. Management strategies were discussed in detail.
   RESULTS: Ventricular pressure was lower than 70 mm H2O in all 39 patients, and the lowest value was -10 cm H2O. About an average of 3.5 operations were completed for every patient. Eighteen cases had CNS infection. Eight patients died. Besides 2 patients lost to follow-up, all patients had a poor prognosis with an average GOS-E score of 2.7. For the 29 surviving patients, the time interval from onset to last VP shunt achieved was 31-3880 days, with an average of 376 days.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both LPH and NegPH used to have poor prognosis. However, a good prognosis can be achieved by proper management with a further understanding of the pathophysiology. A new classification for hydrocephalus was proposed according to ventricular pressure, which is necessary and reasonable.

AB PURPOSE: To assess efficacy of immersive virtual reality (VR) surgical simulator training for pedicle screw placement (PSP) in surgical graduate students.
   METHODS: Sixteen inexperienced surgical graduate students were equally randomly assigned to an experimental group (VR group) and a control group (non-VR group). Students in the VR group performed PSP on the immersive VR surgical simulator, and students in the non-VR group were given a traditional introductory teaching session before a cadaver test. Eight adult fresh cadavers, 6 male and 2 female, were collected and randomly allocated to the 2 groups. Each group performed bilateral T11-L4 PSP on the cadavers independently, and the outcomes of PSP in terms of accuracy, success rate, and efficiency were assessed by computed tomography and compared between the 2 groups statistically.
   RESULTS: Accuracy rate of PSP in the VR group was 89.6% versus 60.4% in the non-VR group (P < 0.05), success rate was 100% versus 79.2% (P < 0.05), and mean time was 2.8 +/- 1 minutes versus 4.9 +/- 1 minutes (P < 0.05), all showing significant differences between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: The immersive VR surgical simulator for PSP training model is superior to the traditional training model in terms of accuracy, success rate, and efficiency, showing potential in training new orthopedic spine surgeons.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the biomechanical characteristics of the anterior upper thoracic plate fixation system (AUTP).
   METHODS: Twelve specimens were divided into 2 groups: the AUTP group and the anterior cervical locking plate (ACLP) group. Bone mineral density was assessed in all specimens. The specimens were loaded with pure bending moments of +/- 4 Nm to move toward extension/flexion, right/left lateral tilt, and right/left axial rotation. Each specimen was tested in 3 load cycles under 3 conditions (native, destabilized, and torsion). The tightening moments were assessed in every screw using a torsion meter.
   RESULTS: The tightening moment of the AUTP screws was more pronounced than the ACLP (P < 0.05). Significant decreases after stabilization with the AUTP compared with the native situation were observed in the AUTP group (P < 0.05). In terms of the direction of lateral tilt and torsion, the neutral zone increased significantly after stabilization with the AUTP compared with the native situation (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: The AUTP was shown to provide more rigidity to the destabilized spine than the ACLP.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify the morphological features of the relationship between the manubrium and vertebrae of the cervicothoracic junction for use in guidelines for the selection of the appropriate surgical approach.
   METHODS: We performed a review of 222 midsagittal section magnetic resonance imaging scans. The surgeons' view line was parallel to the inferior caudal vertebral endplate. Morphometric measurement of the manubrium and the cervicothoracic junction's vertebral body included the distance from the highest point of the manubrium to the surgeons' view line and the angle between that line to the horizontal line.
   RESULTS: A significant difference was found with regard to the distance between the groups (P < 0.001). A significant difference between males and females was also identified. The lowest level above the manubrium was the T1. Between the groups, the angles were significantly different (P <= 0.01). Males had a larger angle than females with respect to groups C6, C7, T1 (P < 0.001), and T2 (P = 0.007). In terms of both the distance and the angle, no significant difference was found according to age (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSION: Our results have provided insight into the anatomy of the manubrium and vertebrae of the cervicothoracic junction. Furthermore, our results have shown that, for most people, the T1 forms the boundary of the manubriotomy. We found that both the distance and angle differed significantly according to sex. A better understanding of the radiological anatomy of the surgeons' view line will help in the preoperative assessment of patients and in indicating an appropriate surgical approach.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the microscopic minimally invasive keyhole technique for surgical resection of thoracic spinal meningiomas.
   METHODS: Seventeen consecutive patients with thoracic spinal meningiomas were included in the series from May 2015 to August 2017. All patients were treated using a microscopic keyhole technique through a tubular retractor system. The demographic data and perioperative variables were recorded. At last follow-up, clinical outcome was assessed using the visual analog scale for pain and the American Spinal Injury Association scale for motor and sensory outcome.
   RESULTS: All patients underwent microscopic keyhole surgery and complete resection was achieved. Mean operative time was 153.2 minutes (range 115-300 minutes). Mean blood loss during surgery was 110.3 mL (range 50-175 mL). No infection or aggravation of spinal cord injury occurred after operation, except for 2 patients who had postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage that recovered after conservative treatment. The mean duration of hospital stay was 6.8 days (range 5-10 days). At the last follow-up, all patients had a reduced level of pain as suggested by an average visual analog scale score that improved from 7.6 to 0.2. The American Spinal Injury Association grade improved or remained normal in all patients except 1. No evidence of tumor recurrence or secondary spinal deformity was observed in any patients during the postoperative follow-up period, and spinal stabilities were found to be satisfactory.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, the microscopic minimally invasive keyhole technique can be used safely and effectively for resection of thoracic spinal meningiomas.

AB BACKGROUND: Spinal ependymomas are rare, with an incidence of 1 per 100,000. Given the paucity of data for higher grade II and III disease, the management and patterns of care require further investigation.
   METHODS: Our study of 1345 patients with higher-grade spinal ependymoma used chi(2) tests and simple and multivariable logistic regression models to assess demographic and clinical factors associated with therapy. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests were used to assess overall survival (OS).
   RESULTS: Most grade II patients received surgery alone (81.1%) compared with 36.8% of grade III. Approximately 60% of patients with grade III ependymomas received radiotherapy (RT) versus 15.3% of grade II (P < 0.001). Patients living <= 32 km (20 miles) from a facility were more likely to receive RT (P < 0.001) than were those living further away. On multivariable logistic regression, grade (grade III, odds ratio, 8.6; P < 0.001) and facility distance were significantly associated with receipt of RT (P < 0.0001). The 5-year and 10-year OS was 94.7%/85.1% for patients with grade II disease and 58.2%/46.4% for grade III disease (P < 0.0001). OS was highest at facilities treating an average of 15 patients over 10 years, corresponding to the top 81st percentile in volume. The 10-year OS was 92.6% at facilities treating at least 15 patients and 88.0% at facilities treating 6-14 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 40% of patients with grade III ependymomas do not receive immediate adjuvant therapy, which may be related to distance from a facility. Patients with this rare tumor may benefit from multidisciplinary care at facilities with a larger volume.

AB OBJECTIVE: We investigated pediatric patients presenting with isolated head trauma to emergency service. Where abnormal findings were detected on brain computed tomography (CT) scan, we evaluated the follow-up scan rate and whether follow-up scans affected the treatment protocol.
   METHODS: Pediatric patients who presented to emergency service between 2014 and 2017 with isolated head trauma and were later found to have abnormal findings on CT scan were evaluated. The patients were evaluated in terms of age, sex, pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale score at emergency service, trauma mechanism, and abnormal findings on CT scan. We also documented whether follow-up CT scan altered the treatment decision in patients as to whether they underwent surgery or received conservative treatment.
   RESULTS: The 105 head trauma patients with abnormal findings on CT scan consisted of 58 boys (55.2%) and 47 girls (44.8%). After the first brain CT examination, 5 of the patients (4.7%) underwent emergency surgery. For patients with linear fractures, the number of follow-up CT scans was 2.3. For patients with linear fractures, vomiting was found to be a symptom with statistical meaning as a sign of additional cranial pathology compared with headache, drowsiness, and irritability. A total of 280 follow-up CT scans with a mean number of 2.66 per patient were performed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Follow-up CT scan for patients with abnormal findings on the initial CT scan after head trauma does not influence the decision to choose clinical observation or surgery except in patients with neurologic deterioration.

AB BACKGROUND: Successful resection of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) depends on preoperative assessment of the detailed morphology of the AVM. Simultaneous detailed three-dimensional visualization of the feeding arteries, draining veins, and surrounding structures is needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of high-resolution three-dimensional multifusion medical imaging (HR-3DMMI) for preoperative planning of AVM resection.
   METHODS: HR-3DMMI combined magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, thin-slice computed tomography, and three-dimensional rotational angiography. Surface rendering was mainly used for creation of HR-3DMMI using multiple thresholds to create three-dimensional models. HR-3DMMI technique was used in 8 patients for preoperative planning, and imaging findings were compared with operative findings.
   RESULTS: All feeding arteries and draining veins were found intraoperatively at the same position as estimated preoperatively and were occluded as planned preoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: HR-3DMMI technique demonstrated the precise locations of feeding arteries, draining veins, and surrounding important tissues, such as corticospinal tract and arcuate fiber, preoperatively and estimated the appropriate route for resection of the AVM. HR-3DMMI is expected to be a very useful support tool for surgery of AVM.

ID FOLLOW-UP; COMPLICATIONS; DECOMPRESSION
AB OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the efficacy of oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) in the treatment of degenerative lumbar disease.
   METHODS: Twenty-two patients with degenerative lumbar disease who underwent OLIF between October 2016 and January 2017 were included. Radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging were performed pre-operatively and postoperatively. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the dural sac, disk height, cross-sectional height of the intervertebral foramina, and intervertebral foramina CSA were measured. Scores from the visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and Medical Outcome Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, obtained preoperatively, 1 week and 3 months postoperatively, and at the final follow-up, were compared.
   RESULTS: Forty-five segments were fused in 22 patients using OLIF. Postoperatively, CSA increased from 0.79 +/- 0.32 cm(2) to 1.40 +/- 0.37 cm(2), disk height increased from 0.67 +/- 0.24 cm to 1.15 +/- 0.31 cm, cross-sectional height increased from 1.51 +/- 0.25 cm to 2.01 +/- 0.31 cm, and intervertebral foramina increased from 1.11 +/- 0.28 cm(2) to 1.86 +/- 0.38 cm(2) (P < 0.01). The visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey scores of all patients significantly improved postoperatively (P < 0.05). There were no complications involving injuries to spinal nerves, great vessels, abdominal viscera, or ureters. Only 1 patient experienced injury to the psoas major.
   CONCLUSIONS: OLIF is a safe and effective minimally invasive procedure for the treatment of degenerative lumbar disease.

AB OBJECTIVE: We compared the mid-term efficacy and safety of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) using a Zero-Profile device for cervical degenerative disc disease (CDDD) with and without osteoporosis.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of elderly patients with CDDD treated by single-level ACDF with a Zero-Profile device. The patients were divided into group A (osteoporosis) and group B (no osteoporosis) according to the bone mineral density. The clinical outcomes (Japanese Orthopaedic Association, neck disability index, visual analog scale, and short-form 36 scores), radiological outcomes (cervical lordosis and fusion rate), and complications were reviewed at each follow-up examination.
   RESULTS: All procedures were successfully performed in all patients. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association, neck disability index, visual analog scale, and short-form 36 scores and cervical lordosis were significantly improved postoperatively in both groups (P < 0.05). However, no significant difference was found between the 2 groups at each follow-up point (P > 0.05). No significant difference was found in the fusion rate at 3 months postoperatively (group A, 88.9%; group B, 90.0%), dysphagia rate at 1 month postoperatively (group A, 11.1%; group B, 15.0%), or cage subsidence rate at the final follow-up visit (group A, 11.1%; group B, 10.0%; P > 0.05). All patients achieved solid fusion, and no patient had dysphagia at the final follow-up examination.
   CONCLUSIONS: ACDF with the Zero-Profile device can be used as an effective and reliable treatment for single-level CDDD with osteoporosis.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore the appropriate range of C0-C2 correction angles by analyzing cervical sagittal alignment parameters and evaluating clinical outcomes.
   METHODS: The preoperative and postoperative radiographs, visual analogue scale, Japanese Orthopedic Association score, and neck disability index of 65 atlantoaxial dislocation patients were retrospectively collected. The C0-C2 angle, C2-C7 angle, and cervical sagittal vertical axis (cSVA) were measured from the radiographs, and an assessment of cervical degenerative disc disease was made. According to the 2-year postoperative C0-C2 angles, all patients were categorized into a <10 degrees subgroup, 10 degrees-20 degrees subgroup, and >20 degrees subgroups.
   RESULTS: The postoperative C2-C7 angles and cSVA of the 10 degrees-20 degrees subgroup were significantly different from those of the <10 degrees subgroup. The Japanese Orthopedic Association score of the 10 degrees-20 degrees subgroup was significantly different from those of the <10 degrees and >20 degrees subgroups. All patients (26/26) in the 10 degrees-20 degrees subgroup exhibited a cSVA 0-40 mm, 25% of patients (6/24) in the >20 degrees subgroup exhibited a cSVA >40 mm, and 40% of patients (6/15) in the <10 degrees subgroup showed a cSVA <0 mm. The postoperative incidence of cervical degenerative disc disease did not increase in the 10 degrees-20 degrees subgroup.
   CONCLUSIONS: Atlantoaxial dislocation patients with different C0-C2 postoperative angles had different cervical sagittal alignments and clinical outcomes. In our study, the patients within the C0-C2 10 degrees-20 degrees subgroup exhibited superior clinical outcomes and cervical sagittal alignment.

ID INFLAMMATION; MECHANISMS
AB BACKGROUND: Peripheral white blood cells are regularly analyzed on admission for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The prognostic value of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in predicting the 6-month outcome of patients with TBI is unclear.
   METHODS: We designed a single-center retrospective cohort study. Patients admitted to Fudan University Huashan Hospital within 6 hours after TBI were identified between December 2004 and December 2017. The primary outcome was 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale score. Independent predictors of 6-month outcome were assessed using uni- and multivariate analyses. Three models based on admission characteristics were built to evaluate the prognostic value of the NLR in predicting the outcome of patients with TBI. The discriminative ability of predictive models was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC).
   RESULTS: A total of 1291 patients with TBI were included. Multivariate analysis showed age, Glasgow Coma Scale scores at admission, subdural hematoma, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, NLR (P < 0.001), and coagulopathy (P = 0.028) were independent predictors of 6-month outcome. The model combining the NLR and standard variables (AUC = 0.936; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.923-0.949) was more favorable in predicting 6-month outcome of patients with TBI than the model without the NLR (AUC = 0.901; 95% CI, 0.883-0.919) and the model based only on the NLR (AUC = 0.827; 95% CI, 0.802-0.852).
   CONCLUSIONS: NLR is an independent prognostic factor of predicting 6-month outcome of patients with TBI. A high NLR in patients with TBI is associated with poor outcome. The prognostic value of the NLR in predicting 6-month outcome of patients with TBI is favorable.

AB OBJECTIVE: The present retrospective study evaluated the clinical results of full-endoscopic lumbar discectomy (FELD) for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation (LDH) with lumbar posterior ring apophysis fracture (PRAF) using an interlaminar or a transforaminal approach at an inpatient surgery center.
   METHODS: Patients with single-level LDH with type III PRAF who had undergone FELD using an interlaminar or a transforaminal approach from January 2010 to December 2015 were enrolled. The general data recorded included sex, age, location, surgical approach, operative time, hospital stay, perioperative complications, and recurrence. The presence of mobile and immobile fragments was documented. The clinical outcomes were evaluated using a visual analog scale for low back and leg pain. The Oswestry Disability Index was used for the functional assessment and the modified MacNab criteria for patient satisfaction.
   RESULTS: FELD was performed successfully in all cases and no serious perioperative complications were observed. A mobile fragment of PRAS was present in 18 patients and an immobile fragment in 15 patients. Complications occurred in 2 of the 33 included patients; 1 dual tear (3.0%) and 1 transient dysesthesia (3.0%) that did not require further treatment. Recurrence developed in 1 patient (3.0%) and required reoperation. The visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores had significantly improved postoperatively at 3, 6, and 12 months and the final follow-up visit (P < 0.05). Using the modified MacNab criteria, an excellent or good rate of 93.4% was achieved.
   CONCLUSIONS: FELD is a safe and effective minimally invasive approach for the treatment of LDH with type III PRAF. Sufficient preparation and experience are required to achieve satisfactory results.
