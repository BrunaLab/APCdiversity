AB Wastewater treatment plants are known to release microplastics that have been detected in aquatic and terrestrial organisms constituting part of the human diet. Chlorination of wastewater-borne micro-plastics was hypothesized to induce chemical and physical changes detectable by Raman spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In the laboratory, virgin plastics (similar to 0.05 x 2 x 2 mm) were exposed to differing sterilization conditions representative of dosages used in the disinfection of drinking water, wastewater, and heavily contaminated surfaces. Polypropylene (PP) was most resistant to chlorination, followed by high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polystyrene (PS). Polystyrene showed degradation, indicated by changes in Raman peak widths, at concentration-time regimes (CT values) as low as 75 mg min/L, whereas HDPE and PP remained unaltered even at chlorine doses characteristic of wastewater disinfection (150 mg min/L). However, HDPE and PS were not completely resistant to oxidative attack by chlorination. Under extremely harsh conditions, shifts in Raman peaks and the formation of new bonds were observed. These results show that plastics commonly used in consumer products can be chemically altered, some even under conditions prevailing during wastewater treatment. Changes in polymer properties, observed for HDPE and PP under extreme exposure conditions only, are predicted to alter the risk microplastics pose to aquatic and terrestrial biota, since an increase in carbon chlorine (C-CI) bonds is known to increase toxicity, rendering the polymers more hydrophobic and thus more prone to adsorb, accumulate, and transport harmful persistent pollutants to biota in both aquatic and terrestrial environments.

AB This study characterized dissolved organic matter (DOM) obtained from 47 lakes and 2 streams on ice-free areas at Lutzow-Holm Bay and Amundsen Bay in East Antarctica (n = 74), where few biogeochemical studies have been historically conducted. Samples were analyzed for basic water chemistry and by resin fractionation, UV-vis spectroscopy, and excitation emission matrix spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC). Salinity of the samples ranged very broadly from fresh to hypersaline as a result of evaporative concentration. There was a clear positive correlation between log-salinity and the spectral slopes of DOM (S275-295), an indicator of photodegradation. Thus, we interpreted the correlation as a progression of photodegradation by prolonged water retention time. Of the identified seven PARAFAC components, three ubiquitous humic-like components decreased as photodegradation progressed, while a photorefractory UVC humic-like component increased its relative abundance. A non-humic component, traditionally defined as Peak N, did not show a trend depending on photodegradation, and its level was high in nutrient-rich lakes, presumably due to high in-situ production. We found robust correlations between the relative abundance of the ubiquitous humic-like components and that of the Peak N component in the bulk DOM irrespective of water types or ice-free areas. We proposed there were common processes that generated the ubiquitous humic-like components from the Peak N component in the Lutzow-Holm Bay and Amundsen Bay lakes and streams, such as bacterial processing of primary production-derived DOM and photochemical transformation of microbial DOM.

AB Drinking water discoloration is one of the most common customer complaints. The accumulation of residual manganese (Mn) in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) accounts for part of the discolored water that reaches household taps. Field studies were conducted at seven full-scale DWDS to investigate the deposition and release behaviors of Mn in different forms and at different concentrations in finished water. The results show that particulate Mn tended to accumulate in DWDS even at concentrations as low as 10 mu g/L. The oxidation of soluble Mn(II) ions in DWDS was highly affected by water chemistries as well as water age; 10 a of soluble Mn could still transform into particulate Mn under suitable conditions. When total Mn concentration in finished water was below 5 mu g/L, erosion of Mn deposits occurred in DWDS with a Mn deposit inventory. Soluble Mn release was observed when chlorine or chlorine dioxide concentration was lower than 0.1 mg/L, and the release was speculated to be a result of microbial reductive dissolution of Mn oxides. Ensuring the total Mn concentration is below 10 mu g/L and decreasing the particulate Mn concentration to 5 mu g/L. in finished water are both recommended to minimize Mn accumulation risk in DWDS. Enhanced oxidation and filtration for Mn removal during water treatment processes are proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Zero valent iron (ZVI) activating peroxydisulfate (PDS) was demonstrated to be effective in improving the dewaterability of anaerobically digested sludge (ADS). However, details of how ZVI/PDS enhances the dewaterability remain largely unknown. This work therefore aims to reveal the facts of what happen in ZVI/PDS involved ADS systems. Experimental results showed that ZVI/PDS treatment remarkably improved the dewaterability of ADS, with the minimal normalized capillary suction time of 8.6 +/- 0.5 s L/g.VSS being obtained at the dosages of 2 g/g TSS ZVI and 0.5 g/g TSS PDS, which was 42.5% of that in the control. In this case, 71.2% +/- 1.8% of water content (press filtration) was measured, which was 16.9% lower than that determined in the control. The mechanism investigations showed that ZVI activating PDS produced substantially reactive species, i.e., SO4 center dot- and center dot OH, and these strong oxidative radicals decreased surface negative charges of ADS flocs, caused disruption of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and release of intracellular substances, and changed the secondary structure of proteins. Additionally, the products of ZVI oxidation, i.e., Fe2+ and Fe3+, were effective flocculants, thus their generation benefited the coagulation of ADS flocs through compressing double electric layers and neutralizing negative charges of sludge colloidal particles. As a result, the flocculability, hydrophobicity, and flowability of ADS were enhanced, but the bound water content, fractal dimension, and viscosity of ADS were decreased, which were responsible for the improvement of dewaterability. Further analyses exhibited that the contributions of these major contributors were different, and their contributions to the dewaterability improvement were in the order of SO4 center dot- > center dot OH > Fe2+/Fe3+. It was also found that ZVI/PDS treatment enhanced the degradation of recalcitrant organics, inactivation of the fecal coliforms, and mitigation of the toxicity of heavy metals in the dewatered sludge, which were beneficial to its land application.

AB The ability of anaerobic digestion (AD) to eliminate organophosphorus model compounds (OPs) with structural elements of phosphate, phosphorothioate and phosphorodithioate esters was studied. The enzymatic mechanism of the first irreversible degradation reaction was characterized using metabolite pattern and kinetic H-2/C-13-isotope effect in original, cell-free and heat sterilized biogas slurry. The isotope fractionation study suggests different modes of degradation reactions. Representatives for phosphate ester, tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate and tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate, were hydrolyzed in biogas slurry without carbon or hydrogen isotope fractionation. Representatives for phosphorodithioate, Dimethoate and Malathion, were degraded in original slurry yielding carbon enrichment factor (epsilon(C)) of -0.6 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand and -5.5 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand (-0.9 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand and -7.2 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand in cell-free slurry), without hydrogen isotope fractionation. Phosphorothioate degradation represented by Parathion and Parathion-methyl yielded surprisingly different eC (-0.7 +/- 0.2 and -3.6 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand) and epsilon(H) (-33 +/- 5 and -5 +/- 1 parts per thousand) in original slurry compared to cell-free slurry (epsilon(C) = -2.5 +/- 0.5 and -8.6 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand; epsilon(H) = -61 +/- 10 and -10 +/- 3 parts per thousand) suggesting H-C bond cleavage. Degradation of Parathion and Parathion-methyl in sterilized slurry gave carbon but not hydrogen fractionation implying relative thermostable enzymatic activity with different mechanism. The correlation of H-2 and C-13 stable isotope fractionation of Parathion in biogas slurry showed distinct pattern (Lambda(original) = 31 +/- 11, Lambda(cell-free) = 20 +/- 2), indicating different mechanism from chemical hydrolysis. Overall, AD can be a potential treatment for OPs contaminated biomass or contaminated organic waste material. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anaerobic digestion is shifting from a single-purpose technology for renewable energy recovery from organic waste streams to a process for integrated resource recovery. The valorisation of high-rate energy- and phosphorus-rich sludge creates the opportunity for their combined recovery. This phosphate is present in a precipitated form in the sludge, and its release into the liquid phase is an important issue before recovery can be achieved. The objective of this research was to exploit the "unwanted" sulphate reduction process for the release of phosphate into the liquid phase during anaerobic digestion, thus, making it available for recovery. Two different treatments were considered, i.e., a control digester and a digester to which sulphate was added, each operated in triplicate for a period of 119 days. The control digester showed stable methane production at 628 +/- 103 mL CH4 L-1 d(-1), with a feedstock COD (chemical oxygen demand) conversion efficiency of 89.5 +/- 14.6%. In contrast, the digester with sulphate addition showed a 29.9 +/- 15.3% decrease in methane production, reaching an "inhibited steady state", but phosphate release into the liquid phase increased to 58.7 +/- 12.9% of total P, a factor 4.5 higher than the control digester. This inhibited steady state coincided with a clear shift from a Methanosaetaceae to a Methanosarcinaceae dominated methanogenic community. Overall, the sulphate reduction process allows phosphate release during the anaerobic digestion process, yet, at the cost of a reduced methane production rate. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB At times, certain areas of China suffering from water shortages. While China's government is spurring innovation and infrastructure to help head off such problems, it may be that some water conservation could help as well. It is well-known that water is embodied in traded goods-so called "virtual water trade" (VWT). In China, it seems that many water-poor areas are perversely engaged in VWT. Further, China is engaging in the global trend of fragmentation in production, even as an interregional phenomenon. Perhaps something could be learned about conserving or reducing VWT, if we knew where and how it is practiced. Given some proximate causes, perhaps viable policies could be formulated. To this end, we employ China's multiregional input-output tables straddling two periods to trace the trade of a given region's three types of goods: local final goods, local intermediate goods, and goods that shipped to other regions and countries. We find that goods traded interregionally in China in 2012 embodied 30.4% of all water used nationwide. Nationwide, water use increased substantially over 2007-2012 due to greater shipment volumes of water-intensive products. In fact, as suspected, the rise in value chain-related trade became a major contributing factor. Coastal areas tended to be net receivers of VWT from interior provinces, although reasons differed, e.g. Shanghai received more to fulfill final demand (67.8% of net inflow) and Zhejiang for value-chain related trade (40.2% of net inflow). In sum, the variety of our findings reveals an urgent need to consider trade types and water scarcity when developing water resource allocation and conservation policies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nanoplastics (NPs) derived from degradation of macroplastics and microplastics possess potential threat to aquatic biota and human health. Their fate and transport in aquatic systems are mainly governed by aging processes and aggregation behavior. In this study, we simulated plastic aging process using UV-irradiation and compared the aggregation kinetics of fresh versus aged polystyrene NPs (PSNPs) under aqueous conditions. The results showed that fresh PSNPs had strong negative surface charge and exhibited both reaction-and diffusion-limited aggregation regimes, in agreement with classic Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. Divalent electrolytes were 10-15 times more effective in inducing PSNP aggregation than monovalent electrolytes. The aging process inhibited PSNP aggregation in NaCl solutions by increasing the negative charge on PSNP surface and the organic matter content in solution, while promoted PSNP aggregation in CaCl2 solutions due to interactions between Ca2+ and carboxyl groups formed on aged PSNP surface. Such distinct behaviors were consistent with characterizations by contact angle measurements, potentiometric titration, total organic carbon (TOC) analysis, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Hamaker constants obtained from DLVO fitting decreased from 3.5 x 10(-21) J for fresh PSNPs to 1.5 x 10(-21) J for aged PSNPs. This study indicated that UV-irradiation plays a vital role in governing the fate, transport, and potential hazards of PSNPs in aquatic environments. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB One stage partial nitritation-anammox (PN-A) process has attracted more and more attention due to the low investment cost but the instability in treating low strength wastewater. In this study, for producing a novel composite carrier that could provide high ammonia microenvironment in low strength wastewater, the zeolites and floating materials were combined in the spherical shell and distributed evenly by the spherical polyhedron. And a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) with the composite carriers and ordinary carriers without zeolites as control group was operated for nearly 120 days. The PN-A process were realized in 53 days, and the total nitrogen removal efficiency reached around 85% at influent ammonium concentration of 50 mg/L finally. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the composite carriers showed significant promotion on the proliferation of ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and enrichment of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AnAOB), accounting for 19.14% and 41.65% on the surface, respectively. Moreover, the existence of relative higher abundance of ammonia on the composite carrier surface was validated by the metabolite biomarker of glutamate and especially spermidine. The metabolomics analysis and 16S rRNA function prediction showed that the protein synthesis pathway was obviously upregulated on the composite carriers surface compared with that on the ordinary carriers surface. The higher abundance of glutamate and putrescine indicated that the composite carrier could stimulate the metabolism and growth of bacteria. The present study provided a functional carrier to realize the transformation of activated sludge system into PN-A system treating low strength wastewater, which is significant to the application of the process in mainstream.

AB Over the years, industrial activities that generate high salinity effluents have been intensifying: this has relevant potential for causing organic and microbiological pollution which damages both human and ocean health. The development of new regulations, such as ballast water convention, encourage the development of treatment systems that can be feasible for treating seawater effluents. Accordingly, an approach based on the UV activation of persulfate salts has been assessed. In this scenario, two different persulfate sources (S2O82- and HSO5-) were evaluated under UV-C irradiation for disinfection purposes. An optimization process was performed with low chemical doses (<1 mM). In order to extensively examine the applicability on seawater, different water matrices were tested as well as different microorganisms including both fecal and marine bacteria. An enhancement of UV-inactivation with the addition of persulfate salts was achieved in all cases, kinetic rate constant has been accelerated by up to 79% in seawater. It implies a UV-dose saving up to 45% to achieve 4-log reductions. Best efficiencies were obtained with [HSO5-] = 0.005 mM and [S2O82-] = 0.5 mM. Higher effectiveness was obtained with the use of HSO5- due to its low stability and interaction with chloride. Also, different responses were obtained according to the specific microorganisms by achieving faster disinfection in Gram-negative than in Gram-positive bacteria, the sensitivity observed was Vibrio spp. > E. coli > E. faecalis approximate to Marine Heterotrophic Bacteria. With an evaluation of regrowth after treatment, greater cell damage was detected with the addition of persulfate salts. The major ability of regrowth for marine bacteria encourages the use of a residual disinfectant after disinfection processes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Oil-contaminated wastewaters are generally treated by a combination of physico-chemical and biological methods. Interest in the anaerobic treatment of oily wastewaters has increased since it complements aerobic treatment and produces energy in the form of methane. The objectives of this study were to characterise the anaerobic process spontaneously occurring in a full-scale storage tank at a facility treating waste oil and oil-contaminated effluents, and to evaluate the applicability of an anaerobic moving bed biofilm reactor (AnMBBR) and an anaerobic contact reactor (ACR) for treating the oil contaminated wastewater feeding the storage tank. Three lab-scale reactors were operated in parallel over 465 days: one mesophilic and one thermophilic AnMBBR, and one thermophilic ACR. The wastewater had a high strength with an average chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 36 g/L with a soluble fraction of 80%. The BOD7/COD ratios varied between 0.1 and 0.5, indicating low aerobic degradability. However, biomethane potential tests indicated some level of anaerobic degradability with methane yields between 150 and 200 NmL/gCOD. The full-scale storage tank operated at low organic loading rates (0.35-0.43 kgCOD/m(3)d), and long hydraulic retention times (HRT = 83-104 d). In comparison, the AnMBBRs achieved similar COD reductions (60%) as the full-scale tank but at a much shorter HRT of 30 d. Similar efficiency could only be reached at longer HRTs (43 d) in the ACR due to low biomass levels resulting from poor sludge settleability. The methane yield was higher (210 NmLCH(4)/COD removed) in the AnMBBR operated at 37 degrees C, compared to the other reactors working at 50 degrees C (180 NmLCH(4)/COD removed). This reactor also maintained a higher COD removal (67%) at an increased OLR of 1.1 kgCOD/m(3)d than the AnMBBR at 50 degrees C. The microbial composition of the biomass from the full-scale tank and the laboratory reactors provided evidence for the conversion of oil-contaminated wastewater into methane with a relatively high abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens.

AB The occurrence of harmful cyanobacterial blooms has unabated increased over the last few decades, posing a significant risk for public health. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of catalytic wet peroxide oxidation (CWPO) promoted by modified natural magnetite (Fe3O4-R400/H2O2), as an inexpensive, simple-operation and environmentally-friendly process for the removal of the cyanotoxins that show the major impact on drinking water: microcystins (MC-LR and MC-RR), cylindrospermopsin (CYN), anatoxin-a (ATX) and saxitoxin (STX). The performance of the system was evaluated under ambient conditions and circumneutral pH (pH(0) = 5) using relevant cyanotoxin concentrations (100-500 mu g L-1). The nature of the cyanotoxins determined their reactivity towards CWPO, which decreased in the following order: MC-RR > CYN > MC-LR >> ATX > STX. In this sense, microcystins and CYN were completely removed in short reaction times (1-1.5 h) with a low catalyst concentration (0.2 g L-1) and the stoichiometric amount of H2O2 (2-2.6 mg L-1), while only 60-80% conversion was achieved with ADC and STX in 5 h. In these cases, an intensification of the operating conditions (1 g L-1 catalyst and up to 30 mg H2O2 L-1) was required to remove both toxins in 1 h. The impact of the main components of freshwaters i.e. natural organic matter (NOM) and several inorganic ions (HCO3-, HPO42-, SO42-) on the performance of the process was also investigated. Although the former led to a partial inhibition of the reaction due to HO. scavenging and catalyst coating, the latter did not show any remarkably effect, and the versatility of the process was finally confirmed in a real surface water. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the catalytic system, the toxicity of both the initial cyanotoxins and the resulting CWPO effluents was measured with the brine shrimp Artemia salina. Remarkably, all CWPO effluents were non-toxic at the end of the treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Unlike high-rate anaerobic digesters that employ some mechanism to retain microbial sludge mass, low-rate systems use sufficiently long hydraulic retention times to ensure process stability, which becomes economically unattractive for treating large quantities of waste. This study presents the use of attainable region to develop a new strategy to enhance the stability of low-rate digesters. By considering three digestion cases, diary manure only (batch 1) or diary manure with granular (batch 2) or lagoon (batch) sludge as innoculum, the following findings were obtained. (1) For a given concentration of volatile acids in an anaerobic digester, higher concentrations of methanogenic archae can be attained using a digester structure (combination of different digesters) as opposed to single digester. (2) For a given digested substrate, a change in the source of inoculum results in a change in the limits of achievability by the system (attainable limits for batches 1, 2 and 3 were 46.486(g/L)(2), 5.562(g/L)(2) and 0.551(g/L)(2), which resulted in performance improvements of 118.604%,175.627% and 200.436% respectively), and hence optimal digester structure. The evidence from this study suggests that the technique can be used to simultaneously improve process stability, define performance targets and propose digester structures required to achieve a given target.

AB Strategies to determine the removal efficiency of micropollutants in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are widely discussed. Especially the evaluation of the potential benefit of further advanced treatment steps such as an additional tertiary treatment based on ozonation or activated carbon have come into focus. Such evaluation strategies are often based on the removal behavior of known micropollutants via target or suspected analysis. The utilization of nontarget analysis is considered to lead to a more comprehensive picture as also unknown or not expected micropollutants are analyzed. Here, the results of an evaluation via target and nontarget analysis were compared for biological treatment (BT) processes of eleven full-scale WWTPs and three different post-treatments (PTs): one sand filter (SF) and two granular activated carbon (GAC) filters. The similarity of the determined removals from target and nontarget analysis of the BTs increased significantly by excluding easily degradable "features" from the nontarget evaluation. A similar ranking of the removal trends for the BTs could also be achieved by comparing this new subset of nontarget features with a set of nine readily to moderately biodegradable micropollutants. This observation suggests that a performance ranking of BTs based either on target or nontarget analysis is plausible. In contrast to the BTs, the evaluation of the three PTs revealed that the difference of feature removal between SF and the two GACs was small, but large for the target analytes with substantially higher removal effciencies for the GACs compared to the SF. In addition to the removal behavior, the nontarget analysis provided further information about the number and quantity of transformation products (TPs) in the effluent from the BTs. For all BTs more than half (55-67%) of the features detected in the effluent were not found in the influent. A comparable proportion of TPs was also detected after GAC and sand filtration due to their microbial activities. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Tiny metal sulfide particles are usually generated in the metal sulfide precipitation process, and residual dissolved sulfide (H2S, HS- and S2-) generally makes the aggregation and settling performance of these particles worse. In this work, under strongly acidic conditions with 0.102 M H2SO4, the characteristics of CuS, CdS and mixed metal sulfide particles (CuS and CdS) produced in strongly acidic wastewater by HS were initially studied. Then, UV light irradiation was employed to improve the aggregation and settling performance of the metal sulfide particles, and relevant mechanisms were investigated. The results showed that the residual H2S in suspension can deteriorate the settling performance of metal sulfide particles. After H2S was removed, CuS particles exhibited good settling performance, but the settling performance of CdS and mixed sulfide particles remained poor. Subsequent studies showed that UV light irradiation effectively improved the aggregation and settling performance of CdS and mixed metal sulfide particles in the presence of H2S. After 30 min of UV irradiation, the average hydrodynamic diameter of CdS particles increased approximately 166-fold in the presence of 131.40 mg/L H2S, and that of mixed sulfide particles increased approximately 105-fold with the existence of 129.30 mg/L H2S. Further study revealed that H2S in suspensions played an important role in the aggregation of metal sulfide particles under LN irradiation. HS center dot generated by the photolysis of H2S oxidized a portion of S2- on the surface of CdS particles and a portion of S2- and S-n(2-) on the surface of mixed sulfide particles to S-2(2-) and S-0, which resulted in a decrease of negative charge and an enhanced aggregation of these particles. Finally, this study showed that the settling performance of CdS and mixed sulfide particles was effectively improved at high initial H2S concentrations under UV irradiation. This study provides a clean and effective method to improve the metal sulfide precipitation process for strongly acidic wastewater treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is widely present in aqueous environments and plays a significant role in pollutant mitigation and transformation. So far, excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) has been widely applied to quantify fluorescent DOM. However, this approach fails to provide accurate concentration of DOM when fluorescent contaminants exist. In this work, a new method, prior linear decomposition (PLD), is developed to solve this problem by introducing prior information, i.e., EEMs of DOM, into data decomposition. First, EEM of humic acid (HA) with different numbers of random Gaussian peaks are tested to confirm the robustness of PLD. The percentages for the relative errors within 5% are found to be 97.7% and 69% using PLD and PARAFAC, respectively. Then, the determination of mixture of HA with several contaminants is performed, validating the feasibility of DOM quantification and capability of contaminant diagnosis using PLD for synthetic water samples. Finally, DOM-containing natural water samples collected from a polluted lake, river and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) are measured. The testing results confirm that PLD provides an accurate result with less evaluated error than PARAFAC and the EEMs of the contaminants can be inferred precisely. This work clearly demonstrates that PLD offers a robust approach for quantifying fluorescent DOM, which is of great significance in both natural and engineered aqueous environments.

AB The sulfur bioconversion-associated processes (SBAP) for sewage treatment have been extensively reported so far. In this study, biological thiosulfate reduction (BTR)-driven biotechnology for high rate sulfidogenesis and organic removal was explored to further close the gap of our knowledge on the sulfur cycle-based sewage treatment bioprocess. With thiosulfate as the electron acceptor, the sulfidogenic rate in the UASB rector is 105.6 mg S/L/h with the sludge yield of only 0.044 g MLVSS/g CODsubstrate. Thus providing sufficient electron donors or chemical sources (i.e. HS-) for the downstream autotrophic denitrification or for the cost-effective heavy metal precipitation. Thiosulfate disproportionation was not observed in BTR reactor. High-throughput pyrosequencing analysis reveals that Desulfobulbus and Desulfomicrobium are the predominant thiosulfate-reducing genera and the thiosulfate disproportionation-bacteria were at much lower genus level. The specific thiosulfate-reducer i.e. Dethiosulfatibacter which could utilize thiosulfate but not sulfate as the electron acceptor was also identified. Batch testing results indicate that the sulfidogenic activity on thiosulfate was 1.5 times that on sulfate. The optimal pH for BTR activity was between 7.0 and 8.0, a typical pH range of the municipal sewage. Thiosulfate can be efficiently recovered in the sulfide-driven denitritation reactor enriched with abundant sulfide-oxidizing genera (mainly including Thiobacillus and Sulfurimonas). Finally, a conceptual model of the sulfur cycle based on the biotransformation between thiosulfate and sulfide was established, offering new insights into the sustainable SBAP with sludge minimization.

AB Using cross-sectional data for making ecological inference started as a practical means of pooling data to enable meaningful empirical model development. For example, limnologists routinely use sample averages from numerous individual lakes to examine patterns across lakes. The basic assumption behind the use of cross-lake data is often that responses within and across lakes are identical. As data from multiple study units across a wide spatiotemporal scale are increasingly accessible for researchers, an assessment of this assumption is now feasible. In this study, we demonstrate that this assumption is usually unjustified, due largely to a statistical phenomenon known as the Simpson's paradox. Through comparisons of a commonly used empirical model of the effect of nutrients on algal growth developed using several data sets, we discuss the cognitive importance of distinguishing factors affecting lake eutrophication operating at different spatial and temporal scales. Our study proposes the use of the Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach to properly structure the data analysis when data from multiple lakes are employed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, the inactivation of bacteria by light and photo-generated transient species, i.e., hydroxyl radical (HO center dot), excited triplet states of organic matter ((CDOM)-C-3*) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)), was studied. It was found that the exogenous disinfection of E. coli proceeds through a lag time, followed by an exponential phase triggered by photo-generated HO center dot, O-1(2) and (CDOM)-C-3*. Also, we report that the concentration increased of transient species (and especially HO center dot) precursors decreased the lag times of bacteria inactivation. Due to the limitations of the competition kinetics methodology to include the lag phase, an alternative strategy to study the interaction between E. coli and photo-generated transient species was proposed, considering the log-linear pseudo-first order rate constants and lag-times. On this basis and by using APEX software, a full kinetic analysis of exogenous bacterial inactivation, taking into account both lag-time and exponential decay, was developed. This approach provided insights into the conditions that could make exogenous inactivation competitive with the endogenous process for the E. coli inactivation in natural sunlit waters. Hence, this research contributes to the understanding of fundamental kinetic aspects of photoinduced bacterial inactivation, which is the basis for light-assisted processes such as the solar disinfection (SODIS).

AB Recently, ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) have emerged as a new UV source, bringing flexibility for various UV wavelength combinations due to their unique feature of wavelength diversity. In this study, we investigated inactivation mechanisms of representative microorganisms at different wavelength combinations using UV-LEDs. Two types of indicator microorganisms were examined, namely Escherichia coli (E. coli) as a representative bacteria and bacteriophage MS2 as a representative virus. Different inactivation effects were observed, and the results for UVA pretreatment followed by UVC inactivation were particularly interesting. While a substantial shoulder in the E. coli UVC inactivation curve was observed, this was reduced by UVA pretreatment (365 nm) at 17 J/cm(2). Further, 52 J/cm(2) UVA eliminated the shoulder in the fluence-response curves, resulting in improved UVC (265 nm) inactivation of E. coli by over two orders of magnitude. No inactivation improvement was observed for MS2. Moreover, UVA pretreatment eliminated photoreactivation of E. coli but did not affect dark repair. Detailed investigation of inactivation mechanisms revealed that hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) played a significant role in the effects of UVA pretreatment. This study demonstrated that center dot OH radicals were generated inside E. coli cells during UVA pretreatment, which accounted for the subsequent effects on E. coli. The impact of UVA pretreatment on E. coli inactivation and reactivation was mainly due to increased levels of center dot H radicals in E. coli cells, impairing cell functions such as DNA self-repair.

AB Glyphosate, the most commonly used herbicide in the world, can be degraded into more toxic and persistent products such as aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) or non-toxic products such as sarcosine and glycine. In this study, we used liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and electrospray ionization (ESI) source Q Extractive Orbitrap mass spectrometry (ESI-Orbitrap MS) to identify glyphosate degradation products and combined with sequential extraction and stable isotopes to investigate the degradation of glyphosate and transformation of phosphorous (P) product in a soil-water system. The LC-MS and ESI-Orbitrap MS results showed that glycine formed during the early stage but was rapidly utilized by soil microorganisms. AMPA started to accumulate at the late stage and was found to be 3-6 times more resistant than glyphosate against degradation; while no sarcosine was formed. The O-18 labeling and phosphate oxygen isotope results allowed a clear distinction of the fraction of inorganic P (P-i) derived from glyphosate, about half of which was then rapidly taken up and recycled by soil microorganisms. Our results provide the first evidence of the preferential utilization of glyphosate-derived P-i by microorganisms in the soil-water system. The rapid cycling of P-i derived from this disregarded source has important implications on nutrient management as well as water quality. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mobility of radionuclides originating from geological repositories in the subsurface has been shown to be facilitated by clay colloids. In brackish water, however, colloids may flocculate and act to immobilize radionuclides associated with them. Furthermore, little research has been conducted on radionuclide interactions with carbonate rocks. Here, the impact of bentonite colloid presence on the transport of a cocktail of U(VI), Cs, Ce and Re through fractured chalk was investigated. Flow-through experiments were conducted with and without bentonite colloids, present as a mixture of bentonite and Ni-altered montmorillonite colloids. Ce was used as an analogue for reactive actinides in the (III) and (VI) redox states, and Re was considered an analogue for Tc. Filtered brackish groundwater (ionic strength = 170 mM) pumped from a fractured chalk aquitard in the northern Negev Desert of Israel, was used as a solution matrix.
   Rhenium transport was identical to that of the conservative tracer, uranine. The sorption coefficient (K-d) of U(VI), Cs and Re, calculated from batch experiments with crushed chalk, proved to be a good predictor of mass recovery in transport experiments conducted without bentonite colloids. A meaningful Kd value for Ce could not be calculated due to its precipitation as a Ce-carbonate colloids. Transport of both U(VI) and Cs was indifferent to the presence of bentonite colloids. However, the addition of bentonite in the injection solution effectively immobilized Ce, decreasing its recovery from 17-41% to 0.8-1.4%. This indicates that radionuclides which interact with clay colloids that undergo flocculation and deposition may effectively be immobilized in brackish aquifers. The results of this study have implications for the prediction of potential mobility of radionuclides in safety assessments for future geological repositories to be located in fractured carbonate rocks in general and in brackish groundwater in particular.

AB Ammonium (NH4+) can be recovered from water for fertiliser production or even energy production purposes. Because NH4+ recovery is more effective at increased concentrations, electrodialysis (ED) can be used to concentrate NH4+ from side streams, such as sludge reject water, and simultaneously achieve high NW removal efficiencies. However, the effect of osmosis and back-diffusion increases when the NH4+ concentration gradient between the diluate and the concentrate stream increases, resulting in a limitation of the concentration factor and an increase in energy consumption for NH4+-removal. In this study, we showed that operation at dynamic current density (DCD) reduced the effect of osmosis and back diffusion, due to a 75% decrease of the operational run time, compared to operation at a fixed current density (FCD). The concentration factor increased from 4.5 for an FCD to 6.7 for DCD, while the energy consumption of 90% NH4+-removal from synthetic sludge reject water at DCD remained stable at 5.4 MJ.kg-N-1 (C) 2019 The Authors.

ID ODOR PRODUCTION; TASTE; TEMPERATURE; GEOSMIN
AB 2-Methylisobornel (MIB) is one of the most widespread and problematic biogenic compounds causing taste-and-odor problems in freshwater. To investigate the causes of MIB production and develop models to predict the MIB concentration, we have applied empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), a nonlinear approach based on Chaos theory, to the long-term water quality dataset of Kamafusa Reservoir in Japan. The study revealed the dynamic nature of MIB production in the reservoir, and determined causal variables for MIB production, including water temperature, pH, transparency, light intensity, and Green Phormidium. Moreover, EDM established that the system is three-dimensional, and the approach found elevated nonlinearity (from 1.5 to 3) across the whole study period (1996-2015). By taking only one or two candidate predictors with varying time lags, multivariate models for predicting MIB production (best model: r = 0.83, p < 0.001, root mean squared error = 3.1 ng/L) were successfully established. The modeling approach used in this study is a powerful tool for causality identification and odor prediction, thus making important contributions to reservoir management. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fenton sludge (FS) generated from Fenton process with high contents of iron and organic contaminants is regarded as a hazardous waste that requires to be properly disposed. Considering that Fe(III) compounds could stimulate dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR) and enrich iron reducing bacteria (IRB) that utilized Fe(III) as electron acceptor to oxidize organic matters, FS was introduced in anaerobic digestion (AD) reactors for treating wastewater meanwhile disposing FS. Results showed that methane production and organic matters removal significantly increased with dosing FS from 0 to 2.4 g. Also, a majority of organic matters involved in FS was mineralized, including 38.5% of PAHs removal. Humic acids (HA) with redox-activity involved in FS might affect efficiency of DIR. After extracting HA from FS, the rate and the extent of Fe(III) reduction of FS decreased by 33.2% and 13.9%, respectively. Together with analysis of the electron exchange capacity of HA, it suggested that the HA involved in FS might serve as an electron shuttle to effectively promote DIR. The increase of sludge conductivity and the enrichment of IRBs in microbial communities with dosage of FS were in agreement with the above results. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aeration tanks in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are regarded as sources of bioaerosols, often containing particles and microbes. In this study, intestinal bacteria were investigated from biochemical reaction tanks (BRTs) of six municipal WWTPs. It was observed that 86 CFU/m(3) of intestinal bacteria (in average) occurred in the BRTs installed surface aerator, which was higher than those adopted submerged aeration (67 CFU/m(3) in average). 62.72% of fine particles were observed in the BRTs supplied oxygen by submerged aerator, while 75.73% of coarse particles emitted during surface aeration. Pseudomonas sp., Serratia sp. and Acinetobacter sp. were identified as pathogenic bacteria presented in the intestinal bacteria population and most of them existed initially in water or sludge, particularly in water surface. The emission level and particle size distribution were significantly correlated with aeration mode adopted by the WWTPs. The bioaerosols particles emitted from surface aeration process was higher than that from submerged aeration process. Meanwhile, the BRTs with submerged aerators released more fine particles, which can get into the alveoli and represented the potential challenge to human health. Canonical correspondence analysis results exhibited that population of intestinal bacteria had a positive correlation with aeration rate and water quality. As the intestinal bacteria in the bioaerosols emitted from the WWTPs may pose a potential risk to onsite operators, aeration tanks in WWTPs should be paid more attention as a source of intestinal bacterial emissions.

ID FRAMEWORK; RISK; IMPACT; INDEX; MODEL
AB Urban flooding has become a global issue due to climate change, urbanization and limitation in the capacity of urban drainage infrastructures. To tackle the growing threats, it is crucial to understand urban surface flood resilience, i.e., how urban drainage catchments can resist against and recover from flooding. This study proposes a grid cell based resilience metric to assess urban surface flood resilience at the urban drainage catchment scale. The new metric is defined as the ratio of the number of unflooded grid cells to the total grid cell number in an urban drainage catchment. A two-dimensional Cellular Automata based model CADDIES is used to simulate urban surface flooding. This methodology is demonstrated using a case study in Dalian, China, which is divided into 31 urban drainage catchments for flood resilience analysis. Results show the high resolution resilience assessment identifies vulnerable catchments and helps develop effective adaptation strategies to enhance urban surface flood resilience. Comparison of the new metric with an existing metric reveals that new metric has the advantage of fully reflecting the changing process of system performance. Effectiveness of adaptation strategies for enhancing urban surface flood resilience is discussed for different catchments. This study provides a new way to characterize urban flood resilience and an in-depth understanding of flood resilience for urban drainage catchments of different characteristics, and thus help develop effective intervention strategies for sustainable sponge city development.

AB Alkaline (especially pH 10) anaerobic fermentation of waste activated sludge (WAS) has been reported to be an effective approach for hydrogen production through inhibiting the homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis. However, the potential effect of the widespread microplastics in sludge on the performance of hydrogen production has never been reported. To fill this knowledge gap, the dominant polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microplastics in WAS were selected as the model microplastics to evaluate their influences on hydrogen production during alkaline anaerobic fermentation of WAS as well as the key mechanisms involved. Experimental results demonstrated that hydrogen production from WAS decreased in the presence of PET microplastics (i.e., 10, 30 and 60 particles/g-TS) compared to the control, with the hydrogen yield at 60 particles/g-TS being only 70.7 +/- 0.9% of the control. Although the hydrogen consumption (i.e., homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis) was restrained under alkaline (pH 10) condition, PET microplastics inhibited hydrolysis, acidogenesis and acetogenesis in alkaline WAS anaerobic fermentation, leading to the inhibitory effect on hydrogen production. This was further confirmed by the microbial analysis, which clearly showed PET microplastics caused the shift of the microbial community toward the direction against hydrolysis-acidification. Mechanism studies revealed that PET microplastics carried on their negative influence mainly through leaching the toxic di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP). The reactive oxygen species (ROS) and live/dead staining tests indicated that the increased ROS was induced by PET microplastics, causing more cells dead, which further resulted in the decreased production of hydrogen.

AB Urban areas contribute substantially to xenobiotic contaminant loads in rivers, but their effects have been investigated more for individual organisms and sensitive taxa, rather than through the emergent properties of communities. Here, we use replicated, catchment-scale sampling of benthic invertebrates and novel multivariate techniques to assess whether urban wastewater contaminants affected the structure and function of river food webs. We postulated that the continued occurrence of selected contaminants in river systems might explain the incomplete recovery of urban rivers from legacy gross pollution. Benthic invertebrate communities were sampled monthly over a year (2016-2017) at 18 sites across 3 river systems in South Wales (United Kingdom). Contaminant sources were characterised using remote sensing, water quality data from routine monitoring and measured concentrations of selected persistent xenobiotic pollutants (polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers). Urban wastewater discharges had relatively limited effects on river water quality, with small increases in nitrate, phosphate, temperature, conductivity and total dissolved solids in urban systems. Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers in invertebrates, however, were significantly higher under greater urban land cover and wastewater discharge. Food webs at the most highly contaminated urban sites were characterised by: (i) reduced taxonomic and functional diversity; (ii) simplified food web structure with reduced network connectance; and (iii) reductions in the abundance of prey important for apex predators such as the Eurasian dipper (Cinclus cinclus). Although correlative and partially confounded by other effects, these data provide support for the hypothesis that impairment to food webs resulting from urban pollutants might explain population, community and ecosystem-level effects in urban river systems, and hence incomplete recovery from past pollution.

AB Recovering materials with high value and increasing market demand from sewage and/or sludge is becoming more attractive than recovering traditional resources such as nutrients and biogas. Sulfated polysaccharides (SPs) are valuable and scarce raw materials that can only be produced from marine algae and a few types of animal tissues. This study evaluated if SPs are present in activated sludge obtained from saline sewage with a high level of sulfates present. The presence of SPs-containing extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) was confirmed and quantified for both sludge from lab-scale reactors and full-scale plants for the first time. SPs in the sludge of a lab-scale reactor operated under alternating aerobic/anoxic conditions with 500 mg/L sulfate in the influent (which is typical of Hong Kong saline sewage) reached 342.8 +/- 0.3% mg/gVSS, and sludge taken from a full-scale saline wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) contained 418.1 +/- 0.4% mg/gVSS of SPs. Purity of the extracted SPs was comparable to that of commercial industrial-grade products. Key bioactivities of SPs (i.e. fucoidan, carrageenan and heparin), namely anti-angiogenesis, anticoagulant and antioxidant, were confirmed after extraction and purification. Interestingly, operating conditions had a strong influence on the contents and types of SPs synthesized in sludge as well as its bioactivities. Although the detailed synthetic pathways of SPs in activated sludge remain unclear, the current study has made a first attempt to recover a high-value scarce resource from biological wastewater treatment.

AB Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is used widely as Fenton's reagent for organic wastewater treatment. However, the application range of the optimum Fenton reaction is narrow, needing to adjust pH before and after treatment Besides, the disproportionation of H2O2 and generated iron precipitation also confine the normal operation of Fenton method. To overcome the drawbacks of the traditional Fenton process, a Fe(II) catalyzed calcium peroxide (CaO2) Fenton-like process assisted by oxalic acid (OA) for aqueous organic pollutants degradation was proposed (Fe2+/OA/CaO2). The methyl orange (MO) as a typical organic pollutant, its removal performances by this Fe2+/OA/CaO2 system were evaluated. In the optimized conditions, 99% of MO was degraded within 15 min, and 38% mineralized after 180 min when the molar ratio of Fe2+: OA: CaO2 was 1: 2: 2 (Fe2+ = 1.5 mM). Radicals detection indicated that hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) was the main reactive species for the MO elimination. Furthermore, density functional theory calculation was in good agreement with the experimental results, which proved that the Fe2+/OA/CaO2 could improve the circulation between Fe2+ and Fe3+, promoting the oxygen reactive species generation and pollutant removal. The main intermediates were identified and the degradation pathways were proposed based on the results of the mass spectrum analysis, and the attack of HO center dot was suggested as the main function for the MO decomposition. The matrix effects of water constituents on the performance of Fe2+/OA/CaO2 were investigated, and the results showed that a certain amount of Cl-, NO3-, HCO3-, and HA affected the elimination than SO42-. Finally, the attempt of actual wastewater disposal indicated the synergistic system possessed good potential for future practical application. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sludge, of which alginate-like biomaterial is a major organic component, is an increasing environmental problem. Thus, efficient anaerobic degradation of alginate provides a new method for sludge utilization. In this study, anaerobic alginate hydrolytic bacteria (AHB) were proposed to enrich with methanogens synergetically to reduce the inhibition of intermediate metabolites. The COD of produced methane reached 80.7 +/- 1.9% (n = 4) of initial alginate COD. After considering the microbial growth (8%-18% of COD), a good COD balance indicated that alginate was fully consumed and the main final metabolites were methane and CO2. Methanogenesis could promote alginate conversion by AHB. The enriched bacteria for alginate degradation in this study were different from that of former known AHB. The metabolic pathway of alginate degradation was revealed by metagenomics, in which oligo-alginate lyase was detected in twelve bacteria, and typical carbon metabolic pathways to convert alginate to methane were identified. More studies of bacterial isolation and biofuel production are still needed in the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The environmental transformation of nanoparticles results in significant changes in their structure, properties, and toxicity, which are imperative for assessing their environmental impact and health risks. Little is known about the toxicity alteration of fullerene nanoparticles (C-60) after water disinfection processes considering their potential application in antimicrobial control in water treatment ultimately ending in sewage treatment plants. We showed that C-60 aggregates (nC(60)) were converted to more oxidized forms via commonly used water disinfection processes (i.e., photo-transformation and photo chlorination treatment). The light-irradiated nanoparticles (UV_nC(60)) exhibited mitigated cytotoxicity relative to nC(60), whereas photochlorinated nC(60) (UV/Cl_nC(60)) showed an exacerbated outcome. We revealed a distinct toxic mechanism occurring at the nano-bio interface, for which electrons were shuttled by C-60 nanoparticles from membrane-bound NADPH oxidase to extracellular molecular oxygen, resulting in the production of various extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). UV/Cl_nC(60) showed the highest electron-shuttling activity due to its high carbonyl content, and more than 2.4-fold higher level of extracellular hydroxyl radicals were detected relative to that in untreated cells. Although UV_nC(60) possessed a somewhat higher carbonyl content than nC(60), it showed a weaker adhesion to the cell membrane, which compromised the electron-transfer process. The intrinsic ROS generation/quenching capabilities and oxidative potentials of the various nanoparticles were also systematically compared. Overall, this report highlights the importance of understanding environmental transformations in risk assessment and uncovers an overlooked mechanism through which nC(60)/derivatives can modulate the electron transfer process at the nano-bio interface via acting as electron shuttles.

AB Sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) has been extensively studied as a promising alternative in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for water treatment. However, little is known about its reactivity to the ubiquitous dissolved organic matter (DOM) in water bodies. SO4 center dot- would selectively react with electron rich moieties in DOM, known as chromophoric DOM (CDOM), due to its light absorbing property. In this study, the reactivity and typical structural transformation of CDOM with SO4 center dot- was investigated. Four well characterized hydrophobic DOM fractions extracted from different surface water sources were selected as model CDOM. SO4 center dot- was produced through the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) by Co(II) ions at pH 8 in borate buffer. The reactivity of CDOM was studied based on the decrease in its ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UVA(254)) as a function of time. The reactivity of CDOM changed with time where fast and slow reacting CDOMs (i.e., CDOMfast and CDOMslow) were clearly distinguished. A second-order rate constant of CDOMfast with SO4 center dot- was calculated by plotting UVA(254) decrease versus PMS exposure; where a R-ct value (i.e., ratio of sulfate radical exposure to PMS exposure) was calculated using pCBA as a probe compound. The transformation of CDOM was studied through the analysis of the changes in UVA(254), electron donating capacity, fluorescence intensity, and total organic carbon. A transformation pathway leading to a significant carbon removal was proposed. This new knowledge on the kinetics and transformation of CDOM would ultimately assist in the development and operation of SO4 center dot--based water treatment processes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Phosphate, due to its somatotrophic effect on organisms, can cause severe eutrophication with excessive content in water. Conventional methods for phosphate detection, which are based on complicated instruments, are time-consuming. Here we report a luminescent lanthanide functionalized coordination polymer (Eu@BUC-14) by doping Eu3+ cations to BUC-14 nanocrystals. This Eu3+ functionalized hybrid (Eu@BUC-14) presents excellent luminescence features of Eu3+ ion that originated from efficient energy transfer from the ligand. The detection results show that Eu@BUC-14 is a highly efficient luminescent probe for phosphate detection in aqueous solutions, exhibiting high sensitivity with a low detection limit of 0.88 mu M and a short response time of within 5 min. More significantly, Eu@BUC-14 has a high specificity for PO43- over fifteen other pollutant anions and eleven metal cations. The sensing mechanism is proposed via an in-depth analysis of the interaction between PO43- and Eu3+. Simultaneously, it displays high adsorption ability toward PO43- (57.9 mg P/g), making it an outstanding multifunctional material. And the adsorption process plays an important role in preconcentration of PO43- which can lead to a quick fluorescent response with high quenching efficiency. The practicality of Eu@BUC-14 was also validated by sensing PO43- in real environment water samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The seasonal and diurnal patterns of N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) and its formation potential (NMOR FP) were examined with water samples taken from five outlets of four sewage treatment plants (STPs), seven main stream sites, and five tributary sites in the Yodo River basin. STPs were shown to be the main sources of downstream NMOR load. The highest NMOR levels were found in the discharge from one STP (26.4-171 ng/L). Continuous sequential samplings over a period of 24 h at this STP revealed that NMOR flux at the influent point fluctuated in both summer (0.4-3.2 g/h) and winter (0.3-5.4 g/h), while it was steady in the effluent In addition, levels of NMOR remained stable during the biological treatment and disinfection processes. The present research demonstrated that NMOR could be formed from morpholine (MOR) in raw sewage treated by this STP, with a possible mechanism being formaldehyde-catalyzed nitrosation of MOR by nitrites, prior to raw sewage entering the STP. This implies that the NMOR detected here might not be a disinfection byproduct per se under low-chlorine disinfection (around 1.0 mg/L), but is primarily a contaminant that is difficult to remove during sewage treatment NMOR attenuated significantly in the rivers in the daytime with production of MOR, but persisted during nights, which demonstrated the importance of monitoring NMOR levels in the water environment during periods of low UV intensity, especially nights.

AB In this study, we focus on the mathematical model of hyperthermia treatment as one the most constructive and effective procedures. Considering the sophisticated nature of involving phenomena in bioheat transfer inside a living tissue, several models with different levels of simplifications have been proposed. One of the general forms of the bioheat transfer equation which is introduced and studied in this paper for the first time, is the 2D-transient, dual phase lag (DPL), variable-order fractional energy equation. For finding the numerical solution of this general case, we propose an efficient semi-discrete method based on the two-dimensional Legendre wavelets (2D LWs). Precisely, the variable-order fractional derivatives of the model are discretized in the first stage, and then the response of the model is expanded by the 2D LWs. Consequently, the main problem is transformed into an equivalent system of algebraic equations, which can be simply tackled. The stability of the proposed method is examined theoretically and experimentally. Also, the procedure is described for one example to examine the computational efficiency of method. The experimental results show the stability and spectral accuracy of the proposed method. According to the achieved results, increasing the fractional order from 0.1 to 1.0, leads to increment of maximum tissue temperatures by about 29% near the center of the targeted region.

AB Model predictions often exhibit discrepancy with respect to experimental observations, due to assumptions and approximations in the model. Bayesian approaches for estimating discrepancy in single models have been studied in the past. In this paper, we approach the problem of discrepancy estimation in coupled models (especially multi-disciplinary models) using Bayesian state estimation methods. The proposed state estimation-based approach is found to have significant advantages over the previously studied Kennedy-O'Hagan method, in the estimation of discrepancies of hidden states, and in the identification of the sources (namely, model form errors) of the discrepancies. We adopt a partitioned approach to estimate discrepancies in weakly coupled systems and perform state estimation separately for the individual disciplines. The proposed approach is illustrated for a four-discipline problem related to aero-thermo-elastic response prediction of a hypersonic aircraft panel. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We propose a novel framework to solve PDEs on moving manifolds, where the evolving surface is represented by a moving point cloud. This has the advantage of avoiding the need to discretize the bulk volume around the surface, while also avoiding the need to have a global mesh. Distortions in the point cloud as a result of the movement are fixed by local adaptation. We first establish a comprehensive Lagrangian framework for arbitrary movement of curves and surfaces given by point clouds. Collision detection algorithms between point cloud surfaces are introduced, which also allow the handling of evolving manifolds with topological changes. We then couple this Lagrangian framework with a meshfree Generalized Finite Difference Method (GFDM) to approximate surface differential operators, which together give a method to solve PDEs on evolving manifolds. The applicability of this method is illustrated with a range of numerical examples, which include advection-diffusion equations with large deformations of the surface, curvature dependent geometric motion, and wave equations on evolving surfaces.

AB This paper presents a topology optimization method in rarefied gas flow problems to obtain the optimal structure of a flow channel as a configuration of gas and solid domains. In this paper, the kinetic equation, the governing equation of rarefied gas flows, is extended over the entire design domain including solid domains assuming the solid as an imaginary gas for implicitly handling the gas-solid interfaces in the optimization process. Based on the extended equation, a 2D flow channel design problem is formulated, and the design sensitivity is obtained based on the Lagrange multiplier method and adjoint variable method. Both the rarefied gas flow and the adjoint flow are computed by a deterministic method based on a finite discretization of the molecular velocity space, rather than the DSMC method. The validity and effectiveness of our proposed method are confirmed through several numerical examples. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Analysis of reactive-diffusion simulations representing complex mixing processes requires a large number of independent model runs. For each high-fidelity model simulation, the model inputs are varied and the predicted mixing behavior is represented by temporal and spatial changes in species concentration. It is then required to discern how the model inputs (such as diffusivity, dispersion, anisotropy, and velocity field properties) impact the mixing process. This task is challenging and typically involves interpretation of large model outputs representing temporal and spatial changes of species concentration within the model domain. However, the task can be automated and substantially simplified by applying Machine Learning (ML) methods. In this paper, we present an application of an unsupervised ML method (called NTFk) using Non-negative Tensor Factorization (NTF) coupled with a custom clustering procedure based on k-means to reveal the temporal and spatial features in product concentrations. An attractive and unique aspect of the proposed ML method is that it ensures the extracted features are non-negative, which is important to obtain a meaningful deconstruction of the mixing processes. The ML methodology is applied to a large set of high-resolution finite-element model simulations representing anisotropic reaction-diffusion processes in perturbed vortex-based velocity fields. The applied finite-element method ensures that spatial and temporal species concentration are always non-negative, even in the case of high anisotropic contrasts. The simulated reaction is a fast irreversible bimolecular reaction A + B -> C, where species A and B react to form species C. The reactive-diffusion model input parameters that control mixing include properties of the velocity field (such as vortex structures), anisotropic dispersion, and molecular diffusion. We demonstrate the applicability of the ML feature extraction method to produce a meaningful deconstruction of model outputs to discriminate between different physical processes impacting the reactants, their mixing, and the spatial distribution of the product C. The presented ML analysis allowed us to identify additive temporal and spatial features that characterize mixing behavior. The application of the proposed NTFk approach is not limited to reactive-mixing. NTFk can be readily applied to any observed or simulated datasets that can be represented as tensors (multi-dimensional arrays) and have separable latent signatures or features.

AB Data I/O poses a significant bottleneck in large-scale CFD simulations; thus, practitioners would like to significantly reduce the number of times the solution is saved to disk, yet retain the ability to recover any field quantity (at any time instance) a posteriori. The objective of this work is therefore to accurately recover missing CFD data a posteriori at any time instance, given that the solution has been written to disk at only a relatively small number of time instances. We consider in particular high-order discretizations (e.g., discontinuous Galerkin), as such techniques are becoming increasingly popular for the simulation of highly separated flows. To satisfy this objective, this work proposes a methodology consisting of two stages: 1) dimensionality reduction and 2) dynamics learning. For dimensionality reduction, we propose a novel hierarchical approach. First, the method reduces the number of degrees of freedom within each element of the high-order discretization by applying autoencoders from deep learning. Second, the methodology applies principal component analysis to compress the global vector of encodings. This leads to a low-dimensional state, which associates with a nonlinear embedding of the original CFD data. For dynamics learning, we propose to apply regression techniques (e.g., kernel methods) to learn the discrete-time velocity characterizing the time evolution of this low-dimensional state. A numerical example on a large-scale CFD example characterized by nearly 13 million degrees of freedom illustrates the suitability of the proposed method in an industrial setting.

AB In this paper, we propose a multi-symplectic quasi-interpolation method for solving multi-symplectic Hamiltonian partial differential equations. Based on the method of lines, we first discretize the multi-symplectic PDEs using quasi-interpolation method and then employ appropriate time integrators to obtain the full-discrete system. The local conservation properties including multi-symplectic conservation laws, energy conservation laws and momentum conservation laws are discussed in detail. For illustration, we provide two concrete examples: the nonlinear wave equation and the nonlinear Schrodinger equation. The salient feature of our multi-symplectic quasi-interpolation method is that it is valid both on uniform grids and nonuniform grids. The numerical results show the good accuracy and excellent conservation properties of the proposed method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS

DE Non-matching interfaces; Conservative interpolation; Supermesh; Finite
   Volume Method; Collocated-grids
ID MESH ALGORITHM; VALIDATION
AB This paper presents a new strategy to couple non-matching interfaces in the Finite Volume Method based on a conservative interpolation. In contrast to most of the conservative methods, the current approach does not modify the mesh and therefore, the connection between variables at both sides of the interfaces is solved using interpolation. The conservation of fluxes is imposed by a pair of vector equations which relates the matrix coefficients of the Finite Volume problem with the weighting factors used for interpolating. These relations are satisfied by projecting the matrix coefficients from an interface to its opposite and then computing the weighting factors according to a conservation principle. This new strategy is implemented for an incompressible flow solver including a transport equation of a scalar function. The conservation and accuracy properties of the proposed methodology are analyzed in a set of numerical problems where the theory and the computational implementation are validated.

AB This paper presents two kinds of strategies to construct structure-preserving algorithms with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions for the sine-Gordon equation, while most existing structure-preserving algorithms are only valid for zero or periodic boundary conditions. The first strategy is based on the conventional second-order central difference quotient but with a cell-centered grid, while the other is established on the regular grid but incorporated with summation by parts (SBP) operators. Both the methodologies can provide conservative semi-discretizations with different forms of Hamiltonian structures and the discrete energy. However, utilizing the existing SBP formulas, schemes obtained by the second strategy can directly achieve higher-order accuracy while it is not obvious for schemes based on the cell-centered grid to make accuracy improved easily. Further combining the implicit midpoint method and the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach, we construct symplectic integrators and linearly implicit energy-preserving schemes for the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, respectively. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate their effectiveness with the homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Soft solids, such as gelatin or soft tissue, have a shear wave speed that is smaller than the compressional wave speed. Recent observations of shear shock wave generation in the brain, which can easily reach a large Mach number regime, suggest that the cubic nonlinear behavior of soft solids could be responsible for traumatic brain injury. However, currently there are no two-dimensional (2D) models describing the propagation of linearly-polarized shear shock waves in relaxing soft solids. These models are required to model the fundamental wave propagation physics like diffraction, focusing etc., and are related to traumatic brain injuries as it can be used to model the skull/brain morphology. In this work, we present a two-dimensional system of first-order equations modeling the propagation of shear shock waves in a relaxing soft solid, and then this system is solved numerically using the piecewise parabolic method, a high-order finite volume method. The numerical solutions are validated in two parts. First, the nonlinear component, which is designed for large Mach numbers, is validated with a step-shock Riemann problem. Then relaxation mechanisms based on a generalized Maxwell body, which model the non-classical attenuation that occurs in soft tissue, are compared to analytical solutions with an error of 5%-10%. The validation of attenuation also includes dispersion due to causality which is determined by the Kramers-Kronig relations. Finally, the full numerical method, which includes nonlinearity, attenuation, and dispersion, is compared to ultrasonic measurements of shear shock wave propagation in tissue-mimicking phantoms. Two experiments were performed based on high frame-rate ultrasound imaging and tracking in a gelatin phantom 1) planar shear shock waves, and 2) focused shear shock wave propagation. The experimental and numerical waveforms closely match, e.g. the RMS amplitude error is between 12.05% and 12.27%. Moreover, the frequency-content of the temporal signal was compared for third and fifth multiples of fundamental harmonic validating the generation of odd-harmonics due to cubic nonlinearity. Furthermore, the numerical tool was able to estimate the nonlinear parameter in the phantom (beta = 4.4) using a grid-parameter-search. In context of traumatic brain injury, the current method can be used to study the shear shock formation in 2D-sections of human skull, and can also be used for nonlinear parameter estimation in brain.

AB This work deals with the development of the direct reconstruction method (DRM) and its application to the volume integration of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method on multi-dimensional high-order mixed-curved meshes. The conventional quadrature-based DG methods require the humongous computational cost on high-order curved elements due to their non-linear shape functions. To overcome this issue, the flux function is directly reconstructed in the physical domain using nodal polynomials on a target space in a quadrature-free manner. Regarding the target space and distribution of the nodal points, DRM has two variations: the brute force points (BFP) and shape function points (SFP) methods. In both methods, one nodal point corresponds to one nodal basis function of the target space. The DRM-BFP method uses a set of points that empirically minimizes a condition number of the generalized Vandermonde matrix. In the DRM-SFP method, the conventional nodal points are used to span an enlarged target space of the flux function. It requires a larger number of reconstruction points than DRM-BFP but offers easy extendability to the higher-degree polynomial space and a better dealiasing effect. A robust way to compute orthonormal polynomials is provided to achieve lower round-off errors. The proposed methods are validated by the 2-D/3-D Navier-Stokes equations on high-order mixed-curved meshes. The numerical results confirm that the DRM volume integration greatly reduces the computational cost and memory overhead of the conventional quadrature-based DG methods on high-order curved meshes while maintaining an optimal order-of-accuracy as well as resolving the flow physics accurately.

AB We present two approximate Bayesian inference methods for parameter estimation in partial differential equation (PDE) models with space-dependent and state-dependent parameters. We demonstrate that these methods provide accurate and cost-effective alternatives to Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation. We assume a parameterized Gaussian prior on the unknown functions, and approximate the posterior density by a parameterized multivariate Gaussian density. The parameters of the prior and posterior are estimated from sparse observations of the PDE model's states and the unknown functions themselves by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO), a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood of the observations. The first method, Laplace-EM, employs the expectation maximization algorithm to maximize the ELBO, with a Laplace approximation of the posterior on the E-step, and minimization of a Kullback-Leibler divergence on the M-step. The second method, DSVI-EB, employs the doubly stochastic variational inference (DSVI) algorithm, in which the ELBO is maximized via gradient-based stochastic optimization, with noisy gradients computed via simple Monte Carlo sampling and Gaussian backpropagation. We apply these methods to identifying diffusion coefficients in linear and nonlinear diffusion equations, and we find that both methods provide accurate estimates of posterior densities and the hyperparameters of Gaussian priors. While the Laplace-EM method is more accurate, it requires computing Hessians of the physics model. The DSVI-EB method is found to be less accurate but only requires gradients of the physics model.

AB This study presents a molecular simulation method to insert and delete large objects, such as macromolecules or colloids, in a dense medium. This method is based on an extended Hamiltonian formulation that allows extra spatial dimensions for the atoms of the inserted object. By actively controlling the extra coordinates of the atoms, this method can prevent fatal instability in principle and is as efficient as FADE. Its implementation is a straightforward extension of a standard molecular simulation algorithm. This method is first applied successfully to three molecular systems: Ar liquid, linear polymer melts, and a carbon nanotube in an Ar solvent. Unlike FADE, this method does not require extensive pre-testing of each material system to obtain control parameters that depend less on the material properties. Insertion of a nanosized solid sphere, most disruptive to the potential field of the base medium among the objects, is also conducted. This method enables a robust mass exchange in molecular simulation, especially for macromolecules or colloids in complex molecular systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A singularly perturbed convection diffusion problem is solved numerically using finite element method based on higher order polynomials. More precisely, we introduce a modified graded mesh generated using some implicitly defined functions. Higher order parameter uniform convergence is obtained in c-weighted energy norm. Moreover, the error estimates obtained are optimal in the sense that they are free from logarithmic factor. A number of test examples are taken into account and a rigorous comparative analysis is presented. Moreover, we compare the proposed method with others found in the literature. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this work, we employ the Constraint Energy Minimizing Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (CEM-GMsFEM) to solve the problem of linear heterogeneous poroelasticity with coefficients of high contrast. The proposed method makes use of the idea of energy minimization with suitable constraints to generate efficient basis functions for the displacement and the pressure. These basis functions are constructed by solving a class of local auxiliary optimization problems based on eigenfunctions containing local information on the heterogeneity. Techniques of oversampling are adapted to enhance the computational performance. A convergence of first order is shown and illustrated by several numerical tests. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB The article introduces a finite-volume method for the Darcy problem in heterogeneous anisotropic media. The method is based on the mixed formulation for the pressure and its gradient. The method is stable despite collocation of both pressure and its gradient at cell centers and demonstrates the first order convergence on numerous benchmarks as well as good monotonicity property. The method produces quasi-definite matrix, which is numerically shown to have good asymptotics of the condition number. Our flux discretization method is a realization of our more general concept of stable flux discretization for saddle-point systems with vector of several unknowns. In this paper this vector is composed of pressure and its gradient and the saddle-point system is the mixed formulation of the Darcy problem. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we propose and analyze a new class of schemes based on a variant of the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approaches for gradient flows. Precisely, we construct more robust first and second order unconditionally stable schemes by introducing a new defined auxiliary variable to deal with nonlinear terms in gradient flows. The new approach consists in splitting the gradient flow into decoupled linear systems with constant coefficients, which can be solved using existing fast solvers for the Poisson equation. This approach can be regarded as an extension of the SAV method; see, e.g., Shen et al. (2018) [21], in the sense that the new approach comes to be the conventional SAV method when alpha = 0 and removes the boundedness assumption on integral(Omega) F(phi)dx required by the SAV. The new approach only requires that the total free energy or a part of it is bounded from below, which is more realistic in physically meaningful models. The unconditional stability is established, showing that the efficiency of the new approach is less restricted to particular forms of the nonlinear terms. A series of numerical experiments is carried out to verify the theoretical claims and illustrate the efficiency of our method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The paper studies an approximate static condensation method for the diffusion problem with discontinuous diffusion coefficients. The method allows for a general polygonal mesh which is unfitted to the material interfaces. Moreover, the interfaces can be discontinuous across the mesh edges as typical for numerical reconstructions using the volume or moment-of-fluid methods. We apply a mimetic finite difference method to solve local diffusion problems and use P-1 (mortar) edge elements to couple local problems into the global system. The condensation process and the properties of the resulting algebraic system are discussed. It is demonstrated that the method is second order accurate on smooth solutions and performs well for problems with high contrast in diffusion coefficients. Experiments also show the robustness with respect to position of the material interfaces against the underlying mesh. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We are concerned in this paper with the numerical computation of the spectra of highly oscillatory integrals that arise in laser simulations. Discretised using the modified Fourier basis, the spectral problem for the integral equation is converted into two independent infinite systems of linear equations whose unknowns are the coefficients of the modified Fourier functions, namely the cosine and shifted sine functions, respectively. Each (m, n) entry of the resulting coefficient matrices can be represented exactly by expressions involving the error function with an argument that involves the oscillatory parameter omega and the numbers m and n. Moreover, considering the behaviour of the error function for a large argument, the asymptotics for each entry are analysed for large omega or for large m and n and this enables efficient truncation of the infinite systems. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of this method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a linear, second order fully discrete numerical scheme on a staggered grid for a thermodynamically consistent hydrodynamic phase field model of binary compressible fluid flows, derived from the generalized Onsager Principle. The hydrodynamic model possesses not only the variational structure in its constitutive equation, but also warrants the mass, linear momentum conservation as well as energy dissipation. We first reformulate the model using the energy quadratization method into an equivalent form and then discretize the reformulated model to obtain a semidiscrete partial differential equation system using the Crank-Nicolson method in time. The semi-discrete numerical scheme preserves the mass conservation and energy dissipation law in time. Then, we discretize the semidiscrete PDE system on a staggered grid in space to arrive at a fully discrete scheme using 2nd order finite difference methods, which respects a discrete energy dissipation law. We prove the unique solvability of the linear system resulting from the fully discrete scheme. Mesh refinements and numerical examples on phase separation due to spinodal decomposition in binary polymeric fluids and interface evolution in the gas-liquid mixture are presented to show the convergence property and the usefulness of the new scheme in applications, respectively.

AB In this work, we propose a new Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based multifidelity method: physics-informed CoKriging (CoPhIK). In CoKriging-based multifidelity methods, the quantities of interest are modeled as linear combinations of multiple parameterized stationary Gaussian processes (GPs), and the hyperparameters of these GPs are estimated from data via optimization. In CoPhIK, we construct a GP representing low-fidelity data using physics-informed Kriging (PhIK), and model the discrepancy between low- and high-fidelity data using a parameterized GP with hyperparameters identified via optimization. We prove that the physical constraints in the form of deterministic linear operators are satisfied up to an error bound. Furthermore, we combine CoPhIK with a greedy active learning algorithm for guiding the selection of additional observation locations. The efficiency and accuracy of CoPhIK are demonstrated for reconstructing the partially observed modified Branin function, reconstructing the sparsely observed state of a steady state heat transport problem, and learning a conservative tracer distribution from sparse tracer concentration measurements.

AB An automatic approach for 3D analysis of acoustic-structure interaction problems is proposed based on the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM). The acoustic domain studied in this paper is assumed to be infinite. The infinite acoustic domain is divided into a near field (bounded domain) and a far field (unbounded domain). The acoustic near field contains structures of arbitrary shape, while the far field represents the unbounded acoustic domain. For modeling the wave propagation accurately and efficiently, continued fractions are employed to evaluate the dynamic stiffness and impedance of subdomains in both structural and acoustic domains. The time-domain equations for both structural and acoustic domains can be obtained by introducing auxiliary variables. Via satisfying the boundary conditions on the acoustic-structure interface, the global system of equations for acoustic-structure interaction system can be constructed. Symmetric formulations can also be obtained for this coupled system. Since the SBFEM requires the discretization of only the boundary, the mesh transition on the acoustic-structure interface is easily addressed by the subdivisions of 2D surface elements. Automatic meshing techniques can be incorporated in the proposed approach to generate meshes directly from the input geometrical models. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency and potential of the proposed approach for modeling complex 3D acoustic-structure interaction problems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Two new classes of compact weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) polynomial limiters are presented for second-, third-, fourth-, and fifth-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes on irregular simplex elements. The presented WENO-DG procedures are extensions of the high-order WENO finite-volume and finite-difference schemes of Zhu and Shu (2017) [25], (2019) [26] to high-order unstructured DG schemes. A compact positivity preserving limiter is applied to the solutions to ensure pressure and density remain within physical ranges at all time. It is then verified that the bounded WENO-DG maintains the formal order of accuracy of the underlying DG schemes in the smooth regions. The performance of the proposed WENO-DG is also demonstrated with inviscid test cases including the classical Riemann problems, shock-turbulence interaction, scramjet, blunt body flows, and the double Mach Reflection problems.

AB In this paper, we develop third-order conservative sign-preserving and steady-statepreserving time integrations and seek their applications in multispecies and multireaction chemical reactive flows. In this problem, the density and pressure are nonnegative, and the mass fraction for the ith species, denoted as z(i), 1 <= i <= M, should be between 0 and 1, where M is the total number of species. There are four main difficulties in constructing high-order bound-preserving techniques for multispecies and multireaction detonations. First of all, most of the bound-preserving techniques available are based on Euler forward time integration. Therefore, for problems with stiff source, the time step will be significantly limited. Secondly, the mass fraction does not satisfy a maximum-principle and hence it is not easy to preserve the upper bound 1. Thirdly, in most of the previous works for gaseous denotation, the algorithm relies on second-order Strang splitting methods where the flux and stiff source terms can be solved separately, and the extension to high-order time discretization seems to be complicated. Finally, most of the previous ODE solvers for stiff problems cannot preserve the total mass and the positivity of the numerical approximations at the same time. In this paper, we will construct third-order conservative sign-preserving Rugne-Kutta and multistep methods to overcome all these difficulties. The time integrations do not depend on the Strang splitting, i.e. we do not split the flux and the stiff source terms. Moreover, the time discretization can handle the stiff source with large time step and preserves the steady-state. Numerical experiments will be given to demonstrate the good performance of the bound-preserving technique and the stability of the scheme for problems with stiff source terms. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Turbulent shallow flows are characterized by the presence of horizontal large-scale vortices, caused by local variations of the velocity field. Apart from these 2D large vortices, small scale 3D turbulence, mainly produced by the interaction of the flowing water with the solid boundaries, is also present. The energy spectrum of turbulent shallow flows shows the presence of a 2D energy cascade at low wave numbers and a 3D energy cascade at high wave numbers, with a well-defined separation region between them. Horizontal flow movements (e.g. 2D large-scale vortical structures) at low wave numbers mostly determine the hydrodynamic behavior of these flows. Moreover, the generation of standing waves often occurs closely associated to the interaction of 2D horizontal flows with lateral boundaries, this is the case of seiches. To adequately reproduce these phenomena, a mathematical and numerical model able to resolve 2D turbulence is required. We herein show that depth-averaged (DA) unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) models based on the Shallow Water Equations (SWE) are a suitable choice for the resolution of turbulent shallow flows with sufficient accuracy in an affordable computational time. The 3D small-scale vortices are modeled by means of diffusion terms, whereas the 2D large-scales are resolved. A high order numerical scheme is required for the resolution of 2D large eddies. In this work, we design a DA-URANS model based on a high order augmented WENO-ADER scheme. The mathematical model and numerical scheme are validated against observation of complex experiments in an open channel with lateral cavities that involve the presence of resonant phenomena (seiching). The numerical results evidence that the model accurately reproduces both longitudinal and transversal resonant waves and provides an accurate description of the flow field. The high order WENO-ADER scheme combined with a SWE model allows to obtain a powerful, reliable and efficient URANS simulation tool. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this work we propose a variational approach with cell-to-point Galerkin projections for studying two-phase interface advection problems dominated by surface tension. A Volume Of Fluid (VOF) algorithm is used for tracking and locating the evolution of the two-phase interface on a Cartesian grid and a finite element numerical scheme for solving the velocity-pressure state. The velocity field that drives the evolution of this interface is computed from the weak form of the Navier-Stokes equation where the surface tension force is represented in variational form by the continuous surface force (CSF) and continuous surface stress (CSS) methods. Standard numerical approaches solve the strong form of the Navier-Stokes equations and define the CSS term by taking the divergence of the surface tension tensor. This computation of the divergence term results in a singular force which is difficult to compute when the grid is refined since the tensor is computed in a discontinuous cell-by-cell way. In this work we use the variational formulation of the Navier-Stokes equation and avoid differentiation. The tensor, which is a function of the unit normal, is evaluated over regular Sobolev spaces by using a cell-to-point Galerkin projection. This allows a regular piece-wise continuous representation of the surface tensor and the unit normal based on the VOF reconstruction. In standard approaches the CSF surface force is computed by using the curvature, which is the divergence of the unit normal. In this paper we recover the curvature with point-wise Galerkin projection avoiding direct differentiation. Tests on convergence for two and three-dimension in the static and dynamical cases are reported to show the correct representation in the desired spaces. This method is also natural for coupling non uniform grid computation of the fluid with Cartesian grid of the VOF algorithm. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A mesh-free numerical method for solving linear elliptic PDE's using the local kernel theory that was developed for manifold learning is proposed. In particular, this novel approach exploits the local kernel theory which allows one to approximate the Kolmogorov operator associated with Ito diffusion processes on compact Riemannian manifolds without boundary or with Neumann boundary conditions using an integral operator. Theoretical justification for the convergence of this numerical technique is provided under the standard conditions for the existence of the weak solutions of the PDEs. Numerical results on various instructive examples, ranging from PDE's defined on flat and non-flat manifolds with known and unknown embedding functions show accurate approximation with error on the order of the kernel bandwidth parameter.

AB In this work, a comparative study for two simulation methods is conducted for interfacial flows in two dimensions: an arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) finite element method (FEM) on interface-conforming meshes and a phase field lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) on Cartesian meshes with quadtree adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). The methods are validated by simulations of a bubble without and with buoyancy force. In particular, a suspended bubble with initial nonequilibrium shape and a rising bubble driven by buoyancy force are simulated to validate the methods. Additional simulations of the breakup of a rising bubble and the bubble interaction with a horizontal wall are used to quantify the efficacy and efficiency of the two methods. It is observed that the phase field LBM is more dissipative due to the nature of the diffuse interface method used to capture the interfaces. Overall, the results obtained from both methods agree well with each other when the effects due to the numerical artifacts intrinsic to the diffuse interface method can be neglected. Also, the LBM is in general more efficient and easier to be parallelized. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a numerical framework for approximating unknown governing equations using observation data and deep neural networks (DNN). In particular, we propose to use residual network (ResNet) as the basic building block for equation approximation. We demonstrate that the ResNet block can be considered as a one-step method that is exact in temporal integration. We then present two multi-step methods, recurrent ResNet (RT-ResNet) method and recursive ReNet (RS-ResNet) method. The RT-ResNet is a multi-step method on uniform time steps, whereas the RS-ResNet is an adaptive multi-step method using variable time steps. All three methods presented here are based on integral form of the underlying dynamical system. As a result, they do not require time derivative data for equation recovery and can cope with relatively coarsely distributed trajectory data. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In petroleum reservoir simulation, the industry standard preconditioner, the Constrained Pressure Residual method (CPR), is a two-stage process which involves solving a restricted pressure system with Algebraic Multigrid (AMG). Initially designed for isothermal models, this approach is often used in the thermal case. However, it does not have a specific treatment of the additional energy conservation equation and temperature variable. We seek to develop preconditioners which better capture thermal effects such as heat diffusion. In order to study the effects of both pressure and temperature on fluid and heat flow, we consider a model of non-isothermal single phase flow through porous media. For this model, we develop a block preconditioner with an efficient Schur complement approximation. Both the pressure block and the approximate Schur complement are approximately inverted using an AMG V-cycle. The resulting solver is scalable with respect to problem size and parallelization.

AB The cylinder, sandwich and aquarium tests are common experiments used to investigate the performance of high explosives. This paper presents a solution technique which simulates these experiments as two dimensional problems in steady traveling coordinates. Using a coordinate system aligned with the streamlines of the flow, an efficient numerical scheme is developed which uses an approximate Riemann solver to model the change in state across streamlines. The technique can also accommodate arbitrary equations of state for the materials. Two verification exercises show that the algorithm converges at second order. Validation studies using the aquarium experiment agreed well with simulations, though the omission of a material strength model leads to some discrepancies between simulation and experiments for the cylinder test. This computational technique is able to predict the behavior of these common high explosive experiments on the order of minutes on a single processor with very fine spatial resolution, on the order of 10 mu m.

AB We present a data-driven model to reconstruct nonlinear dynamics from a very sparse times series data, which relies on the strength of the echo state network (ESN) in learning nonlinear representation of data. With an assumption of the universal function approximation capability of ESN, it is shown that the reconstruction problem can be formulated as a fixed-point problem, in which the trajectory of the dynamical system is a fixed point of the ESN. An under-relaxed fixed-point iteration is proposed to reconstruct the nonlinear dynamics from a sparse observation. The proposed fixed-point ESN is tested against both univariate and multivariate chaotic dynamical systems by randomly removing up to 95% of the data. It is shown that the fixed-point ESN is able to reconstruct the complex dynamics from only 5 similar to 10% of the data. For a relatively simple non-chaotic dynamical system, the numerical experiments on a forced van der Pol oscillator show that it is possible to reconstruct the nonlinear dynamics from only 1 similar to 2% of the data.

AB This article deals with the optimal design of the individual nanophotonic components of photonic integrated circuits. In the mathematical setting of the three-dimensional, time-harmonic Maxwell equations, we propose a shape and topology optimization algorithm combining Hadamard's boundary variation method with a level set representation of shapes and their evolution. A particular attention is devoted to the robustness of the optimized devices with respect to small uncertainties over the physical or geometrical data of the problem. In this respect, we rely on a simple multi-objective formulation to deal with the two main sources of uncertainties plaguing nanophotonic devices, namely uncertainties over the incoming wavelength, and geometric uncertainties entailed by the lithography and etching fabrication process. Several numerical examples are presented and discussed to assess the efficiency of our methodology. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We develop a coupled grid based particle and implicit boundary integral method for simulation of three-dimensional interfacial flows with the presence of insoluble surfactant. The grid based particle method (GBPM, Leung and Zhao [20]) tracks the interface by the projection of the neighboring Eulerian grid points and does not require stitching of parameterizations nor body fitted moving meshes. Using this GBPM to represent the interface, the surfactant equation defined on the interface is discretized naturally following a new volumetric constant-along-surface-normal extension approach (Chu and Tsai [4]). We first examine the proposed scheme to solve the convection-diffusion equation for the problems with available analytical solutions. The numerical results demonstrate secondorder accuracy of the scheme. We then perform a series of simulations for interfacial flows with insoluble surfactant. The numerical results agree well with the theory, and are comparable with other numerical works in literature. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An update to the numerical shock-fitting scheme from [1] is proposed. The updated scheme locally lowers the order of the scheme in the region of secondary non-fitted waves that interact with the fitted front. In addition, it utilizes a non-uniform mapping from the physical space to the computational space along the streamline direction to offer computational savings over the use of an uniform spacing. The utility of the scheme is first demonstrated on planar ideal gas detonating flows. It is then applied to detonation propagation in a two-dimensional axisymmetric geometry while utilizing an Arrhenius Wescott-Stewart-Davis model for PBX 9502. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Semantic Textual Similarity and Natural Language Inference are two popular natural language understanding tasks used to benchmark sentence representation models where two sentences are paired. In such tasks sentences are represented as bag of words, sequences, trees or convolutions, but the attention model is based on word pairs. In this article we introduce the use of word n-grams in the attention model. Our results on five datasets show an error reduction of up to 41% with respect to the word-based attention model. The improvements are especially relevant with low data regimes and, in the case of natural language inference, on the recently released hard subset of Natural Language Inference datasets.

AB Recently, exploring the impact of investor sentiment on stock market volatility becomes popular yet challenging. Two issues on mixed frequency data and nonlinear relationship modelling have to be addressed simultaneously. To this end, we combine unrestricted mixed data sampling (UMIDAS) and support vector quantile regression (SVQR) to propose a novel UMIDAS-SVQR model under the framework of quantile regression. The UMIDAS-SVQR model can be estimated by solving a quadratic programming problem. Thus, we implement the nonlinear quantile regression on mixed frequency data by introducing a kernel function. We then apply the proposed UMIDAS-SVQR model to predict weekly volatility of SHSE and HS300 in mainland China, using mixed frequency investor sentiment as predictors. The empirical results show that the UMIDAS-SVQR model is promising and superior to several competing models in terms of accuracy and robustness. Additionally, we find that the models with investor sentiment are usually superior to those without considering this across different markets and quantile intervals. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ID ALGORITHM; INDEX
AB With rapid explosion of information, clustering emerged as an active research area for knowledge discovery. Most of the existing clustering algorithms become ineffective when inappropriate parameters are provided or applied on a dataset which consists of clusters of diverse shapes, sizes, and varying densities. To overcome these issues, many graph based hybrid clustering algorithms have been proposed but these algorithms first generate a complete graph of the dataset which takes O(N-2) time where N is the number of data points which limits their application on large datasets. This paper proposes an algorithm namely a fast hybrid clustering technique based on local nearest neighbor using minimum spanning tree to reduce the computational overhead. In the first step, the algorithm partitions the dataset into large number of sub-clusters based on dispersion of data points to capture the geometry of clusters. After partitioning the dataset, a minimum spanning tree based on the centroids of each of the sub-clusters is constructed to identify the adjacent pairs. A novel merge method is proposed to find the genuine clusters by repeatedly merging the adjacent sub-clusters. The cohesion and intra-similarity are introduced to compute the level of dispersion of data points with respect to the centers of an adjacent pair and average edge weight of a sub-clusters respectively. The algorithm takes O(N-3/2) time which is root N factor improvement over the popular hybrid clustering algorithms. Experimental analyses on both synthetic as well as gene expression datasets demonstrate that the proposed technique shows significant improvement over competing clustering algorithms in terms of execution time and improved cluster quality. Moreover, the proposed algorithm does not require any user defined parameters and it can estimate the number of clusters more accurately. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB During the last few years, computer performance has reached a turning point where computing power is no longer the only important concern. This way, the emphasis is shifting from an exclusive focus on the optimisation of the computing system to optimising other systems, like the memory system. Broadly speaking, testing memory systems entails two main challenges: the oracle problem and the reliable test set problem. The former consists in deciding if the outputs of a test suite are correct. The latter refers to providing an appropriate test suite for determining the correctness of the system under test.
   In this paper we propose an expert system for checking the correctness of memory systems. In order to face these challenges, our proposed system combines two orthogonal techniques - simulation and metamorphic testing - enabling the automatic generation of appropriate test cases and deciding if their outputs are correct. In contrast to conventional expert systems, our system includes a factual database containing the results of previous simulations, and a simulation platform for computing the behaviour of memory systems. The knowledge of the expert is represented in the form of metamorphic relations, which are properties of the analysed system involving multiple inputs and their outputs. Thus, the main contribution of this work is two-fold: a method to automatise the testing process of memory systems, and a novel expert system design focusing on increasing the overall performance of the testing process.
   To show the applicability of our system, we have performed a thorough evaluation using 500 memory configurations and 4 different memory management algorithms, which entailed the execution of more than one million of simulations. The evaluation used mutation testing, injecting faults in the memory management algorithms. The developed expert system was able to detect over 99% of the critical injected faults, hence obtaining very promising results, and outperforming other standard techniques like random testing.

ID CLONE DETECTION
AB Software clone detection is an emerging research area in the field of software engineering. Software systems are subjected to continuous modifications in source code to improve the performance of the software, which may lead to code redundancy. Duplicate code/code clone is a piece of code reworked several times in software programs due to copy paste activity or reusability of existing software. Code clone is a prime subject in software evolution. Detection of software clones at the time of software evolution may improve the performance of software and reduce the maintenance cost and effort. This paper proposes metric based methods to detect code clones, as software clone is a universal problem in large scale programming environment. This paper introduces two metric based approaches to detect code clones by comparing (i) Control Statement Features (ii) Program Features like different types of statements, operators and operands. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets, C projects of Bellon's benchmark dataset and student lab programs (SLP).The methods efficiently identify similar functional clones. Proposed models only find similarity of whole programs but intelligent enough to highlight similar code segments across program files. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Shapelet is a time series subsequence that can best represent the time series of one class. Shapelet can improve the accuracy and efficiency of classification, as well as the interpretability of classification results. Although shapelet has good classification performance, how to efficiently find the optimal shapelet is still an important challenge due to the large number of shapelet candidates contained in a time series. In this paper, a new shapelet discovery method, referred to as Pruning Shapelets with Key Points (PSKP), is proposed. PSKP first finds the key points in time series according to the standard deviation of each time tick of time series, and then extracts shapelet candidates with these key points. Finally, PSKP classifies the time series through a decision tree constructed based on the optimal shapelet. We make experiments on various data sets and evaluate the performance of the proposed method with compared candidates. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible and effective. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID RECOMMENDER SYSTEM; NEURAL-NETWORKS
AB Some existing preference prediction methods have utilized users' review texts to learn additional knowledge to support the prediction task. Such methods determine and represent users' preference knowledge by conducting user sentiment, aspect sentiment and topic analysis as recognized in the review texts. However, the discovered item topics from topic-based methods may not fit the preferences of most users while the discovered users' opinions and aspects' sentiments from sentiment based methods may not reflect each user's opinion. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to learn and represent users' preference knowledge from review texts and utilize the acquired representation to support rating prediction. Our approach assumes that user preferences are affected by relevant item aspects and majority preference which can be captured through proper summarization and representation of users' review texts. Thus, two deep learning practices are established: the recurrent neural network- Long Short-Term Memory (RNN-LSTM) architecture to learn users' preference knowledge along with item aspects which influence preferences and the Doc2Vec algorithm to convert the acquired knowledge to a suitable representation. The approach extends probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) model by strengthening its latent factors predictions with the acquired preference knowledge which is used to regulate the predictions. Our experiments on the Amazon products dataset have revealed the capability of learning a suitable representation for users' preference knowledge and its impact on rating prediction as our proposed approach beats alternative methods.

AB The volatility is related to financial risk and its prediction accuracy is very important in portfolio optimisation. A large body of literature to-date suggests Support Vector Machines (SVM) as the "best of regression algorithms for financial data regression. Recent work however found that new deep learning-Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM RNNs) outperformed SVM for classification problems. In the present paper we conduct a new unbiased evaluation of these two modelling techniques for regression problems, and we also compare them with a popular regression model - Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model for financial volatility or risk forecasting. Our experiments using financial data show that the LSTM RNNs performed as good as v-SVR for large interval volatility forecasting and both performed much better than GARCH model for two financial indices (S&P 500 and AAPL). The LSTM RNNS deep learning method can learn from big raw data and can be run with many hidden layers and neurons under GPU to achieve a good prediction for long sequence data compared to the support vector regression. The deep learning technique - LSTM RNNs with big data can be used to improve the volatility prediction instead of v-SVR when the v-SVR does not predict well for some financial stocks of a portfolio. This will help investors to win the competition to maximize their profit. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MATRIX FACTORIZATION; RECOMMENDATION; CONTEXT
AB In collaborative filtering, one of the main challenges that researchers face is sparseness in the data, which is caused by users rating fewer items as the number of items increase in the dataset. The effect is poor predictions and recommendations of items to users by expert and intelligent systems like the recommender system. This paper proposes a Nearest Neighbour Artificial Immune System with a Genetic Algorithm (NNAISGA) to perform fast data imputations to reduce sparseness. The main impact is sustained and reliable predictions as the number of missing data increases in the dataset. The second benefit is to help sustain or improve recommendations of items to users from common methods used in collaborative filtering such as the User-based, Item-based, Slope-one, Tendencies-based and Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation (NNMF) methods. We show that NNAISGA is the desired method for learning and imputation over the traditional genetic algorithm. The findings show that using the NNAISGA as a fast imputation method yields promising results. All of the methods, except for the User-based method, show significant improvements or sustained accuracies in terms of predictions and recommendations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a preliminary algorithm which is designed to reduce the processing cost of continuing clustering in dynamic networks. This algorithm considers that various types of changes (Inserts and deletes) might affect the clustered data over time. It promises to provide both a reliable and updated answer for clustering problem at all times. By altering the well-known K-means algorithm, this enhanced version has three parts: Initializer and Sorter, the main objective of this part is to initialize the algorithm and to store some data that can be used to reduce the calculations later on, The Dynamic Modifier, this part applies the modifications on clusters and also updates the centroids and the related info to keep the clusters valid, and The Detector, which detects the potent nodes which might need to swap their clusters after applying the recent changes that Dynamic Modifier applied. This algorithm reduces the amount of calculations by using the related data from the last scope of the clustered network to detect the potent nodes, so it can only check them for further modifications. The simulation results indicate that the number of checked nodes and the total consumed time during each iteration is reduced significantly comparing to the traditional K-means algorithm.

AB This research set out to identify and structure the words and expressions related to customers' likes and dislikes found in online reviews on order to guide product development. Previous methods have mainly focused on product features, yet reviewers express preferences on much more. Here we build on an extensive review of the design science literature to propose a summarization model containing multiple aspects of user preference, such as product affordances, emotions, and usage conditions. We also uncover the linguistic patterns describing these aspects of preference, and draft them into annotation guidelines. A case study demonstrates that our proposed model and annotation guidelines enable human annotators to structure the online reviews with high inter-agreement. As high inter-rater-agreement human annotation results are an essential step towards automating the online review summarization process with natural language processing, this study brings material for future automatization research.

ID ALGORITHM; ASTERISK; AIRCRAFT; PATHS; RISK
AB The Canadian Traveler Problem (CTP) and the Obstacle Neutralization Problem (ONP) are two well-studied graph-theoretic path planning problems in the literature and both problems have been shown to be computationally intractable. In CTP, certain edges in a graph are blocked by a known probability and their status is revealed only when the traversing agent is at either end of these edges using the agent's limited disambiguation capability. The goal is to minimize the expected length of the traversal between a starting and a termination vertex by devising a policy that dictates in real-time which edge to disambiguate. In ONP, an agent needs to safely and swiftly navigate from a given source location to a destination through an arrangement of obstacles in the plane. The agent has a limited neutralization capability and uses it to safely pass through an obstacle at a cost of increased traversal length. The agent's goal is to find the sequence of obstacles to be neutralized en route which minimizes the overall traversal length subject to the agent's limited neutralization capability. Both of these problems have important and practical applications within the context of expert and intelligent systems. These include: autonomous robot navigation, adaptive transportation systems, naval and land minefield countermeasures, and navigation inside disaster areas for emergency relief operations. In this study, we consider a new path planning problem in the simultaneous presence of disambiguation and neutralization capabilities. This appears to be the first of its kind in the literature despite the close and inherent relationship between CTP and ONP. We call this problem the Canadian Traveler Problem with Neutralizations (CTPN). We present a Markov decision process formulation of CTPN and propose an optimal algorithm. This is based on an extension of the well-known AO* search algorithm. We provide computational experiments on Delaunay graphs to assess the relative performance of this algorithm in comparison to the well-known value iteration and AO* algorithms. We then investigate the relative utility and importance of the disambiguation and neutralization capabilities in order to assist decision-makers with financial constraints as well as navigation performance decisions.

AB In recent years, the trend of embedding chaos in the optimization algorithms has grown multifold. Usually, the chaotic algorithms employ chaotic sequences instead of random numbers, in the exploration phase or they employ chaotic numbers for decision making in the exploitation phase. In literature, the positive impact of chaos over the performance of algorithms have been studied and reported. However, very little work is reported on the implications of chaos on the bridging mechanism between the exploration and exploitation phases. This paper presents implications of different chaotic sequences on the performance of Grasshopper Optimisation Algorithm (GOA). A bridging mechanism based on sinusoidal truncated function is proposed first, then 10 different normalize chaotic sequences are employed with this function. Along with this bridging mechanism, a chaotic operator derived crossover scheme is also proposed. These experiments evolve 11 different variants of GOA. The proposed modifications maintain an effective balance between exploration and exploitation phases. Simultaneously, it reduces the attraction, repulsion and comfort zone chaotically. New variants are benchmarked on latest 29 Congress on Evolutionary Computation-2017 (CEC-2017) functions. Efficacy of these variants is validated with several statistical tests and plots. Further, some real life challenging problem of engineering domain are considered for evaluating the efficacy of the proposed variants. These problems are Model Order Reduction (MOR) of control engineering, Protein Structure Prediction (PSP) of bio informatics and Frequency Modulated Sound Wave Parameter Synthesis Problem of parameter estimation. Results reveal that proposed variants exhibit better exploration and exploitation properties as compared to the parent algorithm. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The traditional traffic counting location problem (TCLP) aims to determine the location of counting stations that would best cover a road network for the purpose of obtaining traffic flows. This information can be used, for example, to estimate origin-destination (OD) trip tables. It is well noted that the quality of the estimated OD trip tables is related to an appropriate set of links with traffic counters and to the quality of the traffic counting. In this paper, we propose two methods (Branch-and-Cut algorithm and Clustering Search heuristic) to define the location of the traffic counters in a network, in order to count all flows between origins and destinations. A Genetic Algorithm heuristic presented in the literature is implemented in order to perform a fair comparison of results. Computational experiments conducted on real instances, composed by the Brazilian states, have shown the benefit of the proposed methods. Statistical tests show that Clustering Search heuristic has outperformed all other approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Corporate distress models are central to regulators and financial institutions that need to evaluate the default risk of corporate firms. They are traditionally only based on the numerical financial variables in the firms' annual reports. In this paper we develop a model that employs the unstructured textual data in the reports as well, namely the auditors' reports and managements' statements. Our model consists of a convolutional recurrent neural network which, when concatenated with the numerical financial variables, learns a descriptive representation of the text that is suited for corporate distress prediction. We find that the unstructured data provides a statistically significant enhancement of the distress prediction performance, in particular for large firms where accurate predictions are of the utmost importance. Furthermore, we find that auditors' reports are more informative than managements' statements and that a joint model including both managements' statements and auditors' reports displays no enhancement relative to a model including only auditors' reports. Our model demonstrates a direct improvement over existing state-of-the-art models in the field of distress modelling. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, the prediction of the most efficient configuration of a vast set of devices used for mounting an optimised cloud computing services and virtual networks environments have attracted growing attention. This paper proposes a paradigm shift in modelling transmission control protocol (TCP) behaviour over time in virtual networks by using data envelopment analysis (DEA) models. Firstly, it proves that self-similarity with long-range dependency is presented differently in every network device. This study implements a novel fractal dimension concept on virtual networks for prediction, where this key index informs if the transport layer forwards services with smooth or jagged behaviour over time. Another substantial contribution is proving that virtual network devices have a distinct fractal memory, TCP bandwidth performance, and fractal dimension over time, presenting themselves as important factor for forecasting of spatiotemporal data. Thus, a continuous stepwise fractal performance evaluation framework methodology is developed as an expert system for virtual network assessment and performs a fractal analysis as a knowledge representation. In addition, due to the limitations of classical DEA models, the windows multiplicative data envelopment analysis (WMDEA) model is used to dynamically assess the fractal time series from virtual network hypervisors. For knowledge acquisition, 50 different virtual network hypervisors were appraised as decision-making units (DMU). Finally, this expert system also acts as a math hypervisor capable of determining the correct fractal pattern to follow when delivering TCP services in an optimised virtual network.

   quality assessment
AB Automated quality assessment of collaboratively created Web content is important to guarantee scalability and lack of bias. The state-of-the-art solution for this problem relies on multi-view learning, where quality is considered a multifaceted concept that can be learned from human assessments. To this effect, features describing quality have been devised and grouped into views based on criteria such as text structure, readability, style, user edit history, etc. The tasks of determining the views and properly combining them require the assistance of an expert, which is hard to do in scenarios where they are overlapping or hard to interpret by humans. In this work we propose an automatic view generator, specially designed for the problem of automated content quality assessment with no manual intervention. Automatic view generation is achieved by finding clusters of highly correlated features. This process is performed iteratively, by automatically creating new clusters, evaluating them, and keeping those that perform the best. Experiments on three popular Wiki datasets show that our automated views are able to reduce the classification error of the original features by up to 20%. This happens by automatically generating views that are very similar to those manually built, while keeping only a small set of features to reduce noise and overfitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Due to its small size, slow flying speed, and low flying altitude, classification of mini-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using a frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) surveillance radar is a challenging task. This is because the FMCW radar echo signals are acquired at a short dwell time and thus contain limited information about targets. In this paper, we first analyze FMCW radar returns from various types of UAVs and non-UAV objects in terms of the micro-Doppler signature (m-DS) pattern. Based on the analysis results, we propose an effective and efficient UAV classification system using FMCW radar echo signals. The proposed system consists of five main parts namely, (i) burst selection, (ii) rule-based scan pruning, (iii) the empirical mode decomposition based m-DS analysis and features extraction, (iv) error counting minimization based class label estimation, and (v) scan-to-scan filtering. Our experimental results on physically measured FMCW radar echo signals from several types of UAVs and non-UAV objects show that the proposed system consistently outperforms a commercial-off-the-shelf UAV classification system in terms of the classification accuracy.

ID PREDICTION
AB This paper proposes a method of recognizing the intention of human activity based on percept sequences that represent the activities of daily living (ADL) in a residential space. Based on the activity intention ontology representing actions, poses, and nearby objects related to human activity intentions, the proposed method identifies a human activity intention by using the event calculus when a percept sequence is entered. It is very difficult to recognize ADL occurring in various places in a residence by using regular percept sequences without error. Furthermore, a human activity can have complex intentions. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an activity intention recognition process consisting of three steps. First, the activity intention inference step recognizes the intention of a given percept sequence based on the activity intention ontology. Second, the complex intention-identifying step determines whether to terminate the previously maintained activity intention or continue maintaining it in a complex manner based on the newly inferred activity intention. Third, the uncertainty handling step corrects an inaccurate activity intention caused by an error in the percept sequence. To evaluate the proposed method presented in this paper, activity intention recognition experiments were conducted based on the ADL data that were collected for six households of elderly persons older than 70 years. The results showed that the proposed method has a precision of 99.62% and recall of 92.83%. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of dairy management system (conventional, CNV; organic, ORG; free-range, FRG) and month on retail milk phytoestrogen composition was assessed for 12 consecutive months. ORG milk contained more secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, lariciresinol, sum of plant lignans, daidzein, genistein, formononetin, naringenin, equol, sum of isoflavones and coumestrol, than CNV and FRG milk. This may be explained by the higher supply of pasture, and grazed or ensiled clover, in ORG dairy diets. Seasonal variation in milk phytoestrogen concentrations was higher for ORG than CNV and FRG systems. Phytoestrogen composition did not vary between FRG and CNV milk. Consuming organic milk can increase intake of potentially beneficial lignans and isoflavonoids, and in particular equol; but, any effects on human health from such milk compositional differences cannot be implied.

AB The objective of this work is to investigate the inhibition effects on AGEs formation and the ability of scavenging toxic carbonyls of three stilbenes, resveratrol, oxyresveratrol, and piceatannol. The results showed that the three stilbenes had the activity to inhibit the AGEs formation in BSA-acrolein and BSA-methylglyoxal models, especially piceatannol which showed the strongest inhibition effects on the formation of AGEs with the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) value of 2.44mM and 0.19mM in the BSA-acrolein and BSA-methylglyoxal model, respectively. In addition, the three stilbenes showed the ability to scavenge acrolein and methylglyoxal in pH 7.4 at 37 degrees C. Eight isolated adducts between three stilbenes and toxic carbonyls further confirmed that these three stilbenes could scavenge acrolein and methylglyoxal by forming adducts successfully. Thus, the present study suggested that the consumption of foods containing stilbenes was beneficial for controlling the amount of reactive carbonyl species and the AGEs formation.

AB The instability of Laurel essential oil (LEO) and easy leakage of silver nanoparticle (AgNP) restricts their application in food field. To control their release, liposomes were used to encapsulate LEO and AgNPs (Lip-LEO-AgNPs), and mixed with chitosan to coat polyethylene (PE) films (PC-Lip/LEO/AgNPs) to package pork. The results show that only about 29.30% of LEO and 11.79% of AgNPs were released from the liposome after 7 days at 25 degrees C. Nevertheless, Lip-LEO-AgNPs showed good antioxidant properties. Moreover, PC-Lip/LEO/AgNPs films had good antimicrobial activity. Evaluation tests on pork indicate that PC-Lip/LEO/AgNPs films could keep the quality of pork at 4 degrees C for 15 days while pure PE film only kept it for 9 days, and that the coating films had no cytotoxicity. PC-Lip/LEO/AgNPs films exhibited significant combined action in functional packaging to extend storage period, and provided a new idea for the application of LEO and AgNPs in food.

AB Bell peppers are susceptible to chilling injury (CI). To uncover the metabolism of membrane lipid fatty acids (FAs) accompanying CI, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based approach was used to quantitatively profile major membrane lipid FAs in bell peppers. RT-qPCR was performed to investigate the expression of the key genes that regulate the synthesis of unsaturated FAs. Additionally, we used microstructural, organoleptic, and physicochemical investigations to monitor the primary physiological metabolism of bell peppers. The study revealed that CI symptoms mostly resulted from the destabilization of the cytomembrane, which was induced by decreasing FA desaturation. Moreover, three times lower level of the double bond index in chilled fruits, than the control, further proved that membrane FA unsaturation can be considered a key factor during CI. In conclusion, this study revealed that the metabolism of membrane lipid FAs is involved in responses to CI.

AB TOB aptamer can be adsorbed on the AuNPs surface to form AuNPs-aptamer complexation to prevent AuNPs aggregation in high salt solution. When TOB was added to the AuNPs solution, the aptamer would bind with TOB and depart from the AuNPs surface. The amount of the AuNPs-aptamer complexation depends on the TOB concentration. Different concentration of AuNPs-aptamer can catalyze the reduction reaction of CuSO4 to produce different size Cu2O particle. The resonance scattering peak intensities are correlated with the Cu2O size. Large size Cu2O particle as a resonance scattering spectroscopy probe can remarkable improve the TOB detection sensitivity. We have succeeded to detect the trace TOB in aqueous solutions. The linear range and limit of detection were 0.50-17 nM and 0.19 nM, respectively. This simple and inexpensive method exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity, which was successfully used to detect TOB in milk. The results indicated the accuracy and precision were satisfied.

To create the wet-blended set, a fraction of each sample was reconstituted and re-spray dried at laboratory scale with a benchtop spray dryer. Dry and wet-blended adulterated samples were reconstituted prior to mid-infrared measurement and projected onto a one-class classifier SIMCA model for reconstituted skim milk. Quantitative sensitivities, determined from the normalized orthogonal distances, were compared. Although the non-industrial spray drying introduced a spectroscopic bias, as revealed by the control samples, the non-targeted mid-infrared model showed comparable sensitivities for both blending practices once the main bias-rich spectral regions were removed, validating thereby the proposed concept.

AB To discriminate the trace-rutinosidase variety of Tartary buckwheat 'Manten-Kirari', we developed DNA markers based on RNA polymorphism. Specifically, we mapped 17.76 GB RNA sequences, obtained using HiSeq2000, to create 11,358 large contigs constructed de novo from 'Manten-Kirari' RNA derived from GS-FLX+ titanium. From these, we developed eight DNA markers corresponding to single-to four-nucleotide polymorphisms between 'Manten-Kirari' and 'Hokkai T8', which is representative of normal rutinosidase content varieties in Japan. Using these markers, 'Manten-Kirari' was discriminated from ` Hokkai T8' by eight markers, from major Tartary buckwheat varieties by three markers, and from common buckwheats by two markers. We also performed direct PCR from flour and dried noodle made with 'Manten-Kirari' and ` Hokkai T8'. Based on the results, the DNA markers developed are promising for discriminating ` Manten-Kirari'. This is the first study to develop a DNA marker to discriminate varieties in the Polygonaceae family including buckwheat species.

AB Control of residual levels of synthetic pyrethroids in fresh fruits and vegetables as well as in foodstuff made of fresh agricultural produces is of utmost importance. Apart from the need to more control on application of pesticides by farmers, simple and effective postharvest practices by consumers and/or manufacturers usually applied to produces before consumption may enhance food safety from potentially harmful pesticide residues. The present review discusses the underline factors that control the effectiveness of crops postharvest treatments and the possible mechanisms of loss of pesticides during food processing. It is shown that the effectiveness of postharvest processes is controlled by various factors and that understanding such factors is essential for more control of residual pesticides. Though postharvest processes may lead to substantial reduction of residual pesticides, metabolites of broken pesticides are of great concern.

AB Pesticide residues on foods are a global concern due to the impact on human health. Many countries have adopted regulations to establish Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) to control use of pesticides. This study aimed to determine pesticide residues in frozen fruit and vegetables from Chilean retail stores using UHPLC-Orbitrap MS and QuEChERS (TM) multiresidue-extraction kit. 237 samples of frozen produce were sampled from different supermarkets and times during the year. Abamectin, Chlorpyrifos, Imidacloprid, Iprodione, lambda-cyhalothrin, Spinosad A, and Spinosad D were quantified. Results showed that Iprodione, Spinosad A, and D were the most detected molecules. Pesticides were detected in 96.6% of samples and 21 samples exceeded MRL. Corn and faba beans showed the highest concentration of Iprodione with an average of 6.7 and 5.4 mg/Kg, respectively. Existence of nonconformity in samples highlights the importance to control pesticide residues of Chilean frozen produce, since it represents a latent health threat on consumers.

AB Grapefruits are sensitive to develop chilling injury (CI) on the peel upon postharvest storage at low temperature. We investigated the influence of the storage at 2 and 12 degrees C on CI, carotenoids, and emission of volatiles by intact fruit. CI symptoms at 12 degrees C were restricted to green fruit peel sectors but at 2 degrees C the CI severity was higher and distributed through the whole fruit surface. Fruit peel coloration and carotenes content increased at 12 degrees C whereas experienced minor changes at 2 degrees C. At 2 degrees C the emission of total volatiles and specific monoterpenes, mainly limonene, but also linalool and a-terpineol was enhanced, while storage at 12 degrees C resulted in higher emission and diversity of cyclic sesquiterpenes and aliphatic esters. Results indicate a selective emission of volatiles by intact red grapefruit that appears to be a specific response to the storage temperature or to the cold-induced damage.

AB The aim of the study was to investigate the occurrence and formation of peroxygenase catalysed non-volatile oxidised fatty acids (NVOFAs), especially epoxy and hydroxy fatty acids, which potentially provide off-flavours in oat. A method based on extraction of NVOFAs using accelerated solvent extraction and analysis by UHPLC-ELSD/MS was developed. Hydroxy and epoxy fatty acids from oleic and linoleic acids were present as major NVOFAs in non-heat treated (NHT) oat products, and the contents increased markedly during storage. In a controlled storage experiment, NVOFA contents in NHT oat flours increased to 1700-2000 mu g/g, whereas in heat-treated samples, only to 200-400 mu g/g. Epoxy fatty acids seemed to be the first products that occurred, followed by hydroxy fatty acids and minor NVOFAs. The formation of NVOFAs was related to lipase catalysed lipid hydrolysis and the formation of volatile lipid oxidation products. Inactivation of lipid degrading enzymes is crucial to producing stable oat products.

AB The present work aimed at examining the combined effect of chlorophyll content and light filtering packaging material on the photo-stability of virgin olive oil (VOO) via mesh cell-FTIR spectroscopy monitoring. Four different VOOs of Koroneiki cultivar differing in total chlorophyll content (similar to 12-46 mg/kg) were exposed in parallel to direct visible light (6000 lx, 24 degrees C, 344 h) and FTIR spectra were recorded periodically with or without applying light protection by an industrial filter used for packaging. Findings suggested that the protective role of light filtering material was more evident in the VOO with the lowest total chlorophyll content. Real time monitoring of VOO by mesh cell-FTIR was found to be a useful tool to follow the combined effect of pro-oxidant chlorophylls and the protective light filtering materials on the photo-oxidation process of VOO employing a minute sample amount.

AB Edible seaweeds are highly consumed food with a rich chlorophyll profile. Although seaweeds are mainly cooked ingested, the influence of cooking on the chlorophyll bioaccessibility remains unknown. In this research, cooked Nori, Sea Lettuce and Kombu were subjected to an in vitro digestion and following micellarization investigations. The processing of red seaweed does not affect the chlorophyll recovery, while cooking green and brown seaweeds implies an important increase in chlorophyll recovery after in vitro digestion. In this line, while cooking affects negatively the micellarization rate of chlorophyll derivatives in Nori and Kombu, it does not modify the micellarization in Sea Lettuce. Generally, the chlorophyll bioaccessibility of microwaved seaweeds is always higher than that of boiled ones. However, cooking improves the chlorophyll bioaccessibility in brown seaweeds, while decreases in red seaweeds. In conclusion, the characteristics of food matrix are the determinant factor on the chlorophyll bioaccessibility of cooked seaweeds.

AB Amylose (AM) and amylopectin (AP) functionality during bread making was unravelled with a temperature-controlled time domain proton nuclear magnetic resonance (TD H-1 NMR) toolbox. Fermented doughs from wheat flour containing starches with atypical AP chain length distribution and/or AM to AP ratio, or supplemented with Bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-amylase (BStA) were analyzed in situ during baking and cooling. The gelatinization temperature of starch logically depended on AP crystal stability. It was lower when starch contained a higher portion of short AP branches and higher when starch had higher AP content. During cooling, the onset temperature and extent of AM crystallization were positively related to starch AM content. BStA use resulted in slightly weakened starch networks and increased the starch polymers' mobility at the end of baking. That proton distributions evolved in a way corresponding to starch characteristics supports the suggested interpretation of NMR profiles during baking and cooling.

AB This research investigated the effects of commonly practiced thermal treatments (simulated pasteurization, retort sterilization and UHT sterilization) on peanut protein isolate (PPI)-glucose solution. Results showed that thermal treatment on PPI-glucose solution from mild to drastic conditions would lead to a more ordered and compact protein structure, greater extent of Maillard reaction, higher degree of graft, stronger in vitro antioxidant activities, but decrease in vitro digestion especially lower degree of hydrolysis in two-step enzymolysis by pepsin and then pancreatin. Compared with the unheated PPI-glucose solution, the T-d values of ones autoclaved at 121 degrees C for 30 min and 45 min increased by 5% and 12%, and the Delta H of all the heated samples was lower than the unheated one. The present study indicated that retort sterilization or UHT sterilization treatment could be favourable in producing a beverage containing PPI and glucose with proper digestibility and post-digestion antioxidant activities.

AB Heat stress causes oxidative damage and quality reduction in poultry. Here, a tandem mass tag proteomic approach was applied to investigate the proteomic differences in duck meat from birds exposed to heat stress. Altogether 212 differential proteins were identified, including 178 down-regulated and 34 up-regulated proteins, compared to the control. Malondialdehyde and carbonyl content and cooking loss of the chest muscle significantly increased under heat stress. The proteomic analysis indicated that heat stress suppressed mitochondrial functions and respiratory chains, which might be responsible for the higher oxidation level. The results also revealed potential protective proteins involved in the defensive mechanisms against heat stress in duck muscles, such as sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPases, Mn-superoxide dismutase, heat shock protein family B member 7, methyltransferase like 21C, myosin-binding protein C, and carbonic anhydrase 3. These results provide potential targets for the research and identification of oxidative meat products due to heat stress.

AB This study investigates the impact of different gelatinization characteristics of small and large barley starch granules on their enzymatic hydrolysis and sugar production during mashing. Therefore, a barley malt suspension was consecutively incubated at 45, 62, 72 and 78 degrees C to monitor starch behavior and enzymatic starch hydrolysis and sugar production. The combination of microscopic and rapid visco analyses showed that small starch granules persisted longer in the system and were present non-gelatinized at temperatures higher than 62 degrees C. HPAEC-PAD analysis showed that 8% of the total amount of starch, predominantly small granules, gelatinized at temperatures between 62 degrees C and 78 degrees C. Due to their delayed gelatinization in this system, their enzymatic hydrolysis yielded relatively more dextrins compared to what was observed for large granules. It was concluded that small granules should be taken into account when optimizing enzymatic hydrolysis of barley starch, like in brewing, distilling or bio-ethanol production.

AB Influence of different pre-treatments (Ultra-sonication, heat-moisture treatment (HMT) and acid hydrolysis) on the functional properties, in vitro binding capacity and structural properties of succinylated foxtail millet starch were investigated. The degree of substitution was found to be higher in the succinylated starch pretreated by sonication (USFS-0.39). Pre-treatment of succinylated starch by citric acid (ASFS) had markedly increased the resistant starch content. In vitro studies have confirmed that USFS exhibited the highest cholesterol binding capacity at both pH 2.0 (1.86 mg/g) and pH 7.0 (3.12 mg/g) owing to the chemical bonding and entrapment of cholesterol molecules in the starch matrix. FT-IR had confirmed the cross-linking of succinic anhydride as indicated by the presence of a new peak at 1724 cm(-1). This study concludes that prior treatment of succinylated starch by ultra-sonication is an efficient way to improve the resistant starch content and principally in vitro cholesterol and bile acid/salts binding ability.

AB During ageing, wood adsorbs volatile compounds from beverages. However, chemical interactions involved in sorption still remain unclear, as well as wood capacity to transfer such compounds to subsequent matrices when reused. Therefore, extractions were conducted from used wood manipulating variables such as ethanol concentration, contact temperature and pH, in order to determine their effect in the interaction and consequent recovery of wine volatiles from wood. Mathematical models were outlined, which demonstrated an exclusive effect of ethanol concentration on the extraction of wine volatiles adsorbed in wood, more prominent for compounds of higher hydrophobicity. Thus adsorption of wine volatiles was shown to be based on hydrophobic interactions. Recovery of wood extractives was also modeled, confirming the known positive effect of ethanol and temperature on the overall extraction of characteristic wood compounds. When reused, wood transferred wine compounds to hydroalcoholic matrices, demonstrating its impact and potential as a vector for aroma transference.

AB Deep eutectic solvents (DES) and aqueous glycerol were proposed as green alternatives to conventional solvents for the extraction of polyphenols from grapefruit peels. In order to increase the extraction kinetics and yields of polyphenols, high voltage electrical discharges (HVED) were used as a pre-treatment technology (energy varied between 7.27 and 218 kJ/kg). Results showed that the HVED energy input can be reduced, when the subsequent solid-liquid extraction was performed in 20% (w/v) aqueous glycerol or in DES (lactic acid: glucose) instead of water. The addition of glycerol has reduced the energy of the pre-treatment by 6 times. The same diffusivity of polyphenols (4x10(-11)m(2)/s) was obtained in water from HVED pre-treated peels at 218 kJ/kg and in aqueous glycerol from pre-treated peels at 36 kJ/kg. The solubility of naringin, the main flavonoid compound of grapefruit peels in the solvents, was investigated through a theoretical modelling of its Hansen solubility parameters.

AB The effects of 10 and 20 days of fermentation followed by freeze-drying on the vitamin C and fatty acids contents, chemical conversions and overall chemical composition of Jerusalem artichoke were studied. Fermentation between the 10th and 20th days increased content of all saturated fatty acids and two of the four unsaturated fatty acids. The only fatty acid content that decreased was that of C18: 1 cis 9 acid, which was suggested to be converted to other fatty acids. The experimental data, which were supported by energetical feasibility, suggested the reaction pathways of the mutual conversions of fatty acids and confirmed the decreased vitamin C content during fermentation. Discriminant modelling of the spectral data successfully distinguished the fresh, 10 days and 20 days fermented samples. The correlation of the spectral and reference data allowed to construct reference models for predicting the content of vitamin C and C18: 1 cis 9 fatty acid.

AB Coffee oil is known to be food and therapeutic supplement, both. However, the surface active nature of the oil has not yet been investigated. The present research explored the surface active components in coffee oil, and those responsible for stability of microbubbles at the air-water interface, facilitating its surfactant behavior. The oil's performance was examined through surface tension analysis, foam formation, coalescence rate and foam characteristics (using coffee as a model beverage for foam characterization). These observations confirmed the suitability of coffee oil as a natural substitute for Tween series of surfactants. The H-1 NMR and LC-MS/MS assessments revealed trigonelline, caffeic acid, caffeine, feruloyl quinic acid, di-caffeoyl quinic acid, quinic acid, coumaroyl quinic acid as polar constitutes in coffee oil. These constituents help in formation of the self-assembly (chlorogenic acid -hydrophilic head, hydrocarbon - hydrophobic tail), ultimately forming micelle in coffee. Coffee oil also aided maintenance of a well sustained foam in coffee, similar to other synthetic surfactants.

AB The presented study examined the influence of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), sugar beet fibre (SBF) and apple fibre (AF) incorporation coupled with adequate water levels on gluten-free (GF) batter rheology, bread quality and sensory characteristics. A Box-Behnken experimental design with independent variables: HPMC quantity (2-4 g/100 g), SBF and AF quantity (3-7 g/100 g) and water quantity (180-230 g/100 g depending on the fibre type) based on a maize flour/starch mixture was applied. GF breads with 4 g/100 g HPMC coupled with 3 g/100 g SBF and 7 g/100 g AF reached the highest specific volumes (2.44 cm(3)/g and 3.97 cm(3)/g) accompanied with the lowest crumb hardness (2.29 and 2.10 N, respectively). Appealing crust and crumb colour and good sensory characteristics were achieved in GF breads with 4 g/100 g HPMC and 3, 5 and 7 g/100 g SBF or AF. The corresponding GF breads showed enhanced fibre content (4.56-6.07 g/100 g).

ID NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; ALPHA-LINOLENIC ACID
AB Bovine milk lipids can be replaced with cheaper indigenous vegetable oils to produce milk alternatives with healthier saturated/unsaturated fat balance for those in areas where milk supply is poor or even absent. A wide range of vegetable oils can be used, but their impacts when blended with skimmed milk powder to formulate filled milk powder (FMP) are still unknown. We investigate the baseline variances in 12 types of FMP produced onsite with 3 proportions (10%, 20% and 30%) of 4 different vegetable oils (i.e., coconut, palm, soya-bean and sunflower) using fatty acid-and near infrared spectra profiles. Chemometric analyses revealed 8 significant overlapping clusters of FMP types but 100% classification efficiency was achieved. Sunflower oil, and particularly soya-bean FMP types had statistically the lowest indices of atherogenicity and thrombogenicity. This appears to be the first chemometrics study of FMP; the spectral analytical models used may be effective for product monitoring.

AB Auricularia auricular could be useful as a candidate for human selenium supplementation. This study examined the effects of exogenous Se on the growth, yield, nutritive value, and mineral accumulation of A. auricular. Selenate or selenite (0.5-40.0 mu g g(-1)) had no effect on mycelium morphology or the yield of fruiting bodies. In some cases, they affected the accumulation of inter-elements and significantly decreased the concentrations of copper, iron, and chromium in the Se-enriched fruiting bodies compared to that with control treatments. The polysaccharide (116.5-131.6 mu g g(-1)) and protein (105.2-113.4 mu g g(-1)) content in Se-enriched fruiting bodies were not significantly different from those observed in the controls (polysaccharide, 114.1 mu g g(-1); protein, 105.6 mu g g(-1)). Thus, A. auricular can absorb inorganic Se from the substrate and convert it to organic Se compounds (selenocystine (>= 4.1%), selenomethionine (>= 91.9%), and Se-methylselenocysteine (>= 2.3%)).

AB The profiles of phenolic compounds and antioxidant properties of dehulled foxtail millets were studied. Twentyone phenolics were detected in the free fraction, including a series of nine hydroxycinnamic acid spermidines reported for the first time and three flavonoid C-glycosides of kaempferol and apigenin. Twenty-three phenolic acid derivatives were detected in the bound fraction with ferulic acid being the predominant phenolic acid, as well as four ferulic acid dimers (DFAs) reported for the first time in foxtail millet. Total phenolic contents (TPC) of free and bound fractions varied from 161.86 to 224.47 mg ferulic acid equivalent (FAE)/kg DW, 170.69 to 294.75 mg FAE/kg DW, respectively. Antioxidant activities, based on the DPPH, ABTS%(+) and ORAC assays, were determined for all extracts related to TPC. Dehulled foxtail millet contains a diverse profile of phenolic compounds potentially suitable for development of functional foods with unique antioxidant properties.

AB Changes in physiochemical properties of spray-dried camel milk powders during storage at 11-32% RH and 37 degrees C over 18 weeks were investigated. The results showed that fresh camel milk powders had amorphous structure, clumsy spherical shape particles and almost 100% solubility in water. During storage at controlled low RH levels (<32% RH), reduction in moisture content and a(w) of the powders caused glass transition signals of lactose to evolve, although the powders exhibited a slight development of crystallinity. True density, colour (L*, a* and whiteness), and morphology were almost unchanged during storage while b* values associated with nonenzymatic browning, and fat oxidation into volatile compounds increased steadily. Over storage period, solubility of the powder declined just slightly and secondary structure of proteins unfolded from a-helices to beta-sheets, loops and beta-turns. These changes were more profound for the powders stored at 32% RH than those kept at 11 and 22% RH.

AB This study investigated the accumulation of esters in three hybrid grape cultivars during berry development under two vintages to elucidate the differentiation on their esters biosynthesis. Results showed 'Moldova' showed lower esters content than 'Campbell Early' and 'Catawba' resulting from its limited AAT gene expression and 20 different encoded amino acids. The volatile esters compositions of 'Campbell Early' and 'Catawba' in both vintages were different. Correlation analysis revealed that concentrations of hexyl acetate, 2-phenethyl acetate, ethyl (E, E)-2,4-hexadienoate and ethyl phenylacetate were related to their corresponding alcohols level, whereas threonine and alanine affected ethyl heptanoate formation. Transcriptome analysis indicated that 1847, 1781 and 1870 DEGs, at E-L 35, 36 and 38, respectively, were characterized between ` Campbell Early' and 'Catawba'. The expression level of genes related to the volatile ester precursors biosynthesis, including PRXVIT_ 211s0016g05320, PAO-VIT_217s0000g09100, ACOX-VIT_212s0028g02660, ACOX-VIT_216s0022g01120, echA-VIT_205s0077g00860 and ACOX-VIT_200s0662g00010, exhibited a positive correlation to the concentrations of their corresponding volatile esters.

AB The fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) profiles of fruit peel and pulp of 4 Spanish cultivars of Ziziphus jujuba were studied. The FAMEs profile of the cultivar 'GAL' was studied under two farming practices, (i) organic, 'GAL-E' and conventional, 'GAL-T'. Eleven FAMEs were identified, the predominant ones were cis-palmitoleic acid (pulp) and oleic and palmitic acid (peel). When comparing the FAMEs profiles between organic and conventional 'GAL' peel jujube fruits, the 'GAL-E' (organic) presented a higher unsaturated/saturated ratio than the 'GAL-T' cultivar (conventional), while this relationship in the pulp was the opposite. The 'DAT' cultivar was interesting for its high palmitoleic acid content while the 'GAL-E' and 'GAL-T' cultivars had high contents of oleic, palmitic and linoleic acids. The LDA (linear discriminant analysis) model showed that the FAMEs contents could be used to discriminate the studied cultivars, and the agricultural practice, because all groups were clearly separated with no overlaps.

AB In this work, we report a simple and rapid surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) method for the screening of pesticide residues on fruit peels using a portable Raman spectrometer. Adhesive tapes were used as the sampling media; the effectiveness of different tape brands was examined. Collection efficiencies were found to be 60.2 +/- 7.6%, 54.3 +/- 5.0%, and 52.3 +/- 9.0% on glass, aluminum foil, and fruit peels, respectively. SERS was achieved by applying silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) to the surface of the tape after analyte collection. Preparation of the Ag NPs was optimized for pesticide detection. The limit of detection of triazophos on apple peels was 25 ng/cm(2) with the portable Raman spectrometer. Considering the least favorable conditions, the calculated detection limit was 0.0225 mg/kg, which is an order of magnitude less than the maximum residue limit (MRL, 0.2 mg/kg) in China. The method is sufficiently sensitive for use in field analysis.

AB New cauliflower-like phloroglucinol-glyoxylic acid resin microspheres (PGRMs) with controllable diameters and tuneable surface roughness were prepared using a one-step environmentally-friendly method without a catalyst. The PGRMs obtained exhibited a rough surface, narrow size distribution, and excellent adsorption capacity for polar compounds. The PGRMs were employed as an adsorbent for solid phase extraction (SPE) of kinetin (KT) and 6-benzyladenine (6-BA) in cucumbers and demonstrated better extraction recoveries and purification efficiency than phloroglucin-formaldehyde resin and common commercial adsorbents. Our PGRMs-SPE-HPLC method showed good linearity (r >= 0.9997) ranging from 0.04 to 4.00 mu g/g for KT and 6-BA, and recoveries at three spiked concentration ranged from 77.8% to 104.4% with RSDs <= 6.8%. This PGRMs-SPE-HPLC method was applied successfully to determine of KT and 6-BA in cucumbers.

AB Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a non-protein amino acid with various health benefits. GABA enrichment in soy products such as tempeh, doenjang, and soymilk have been reported. However, no study has explored how GABA interacts with soy proteins and affects their properties. The current study investigated the physicochemical and functional properties of soy proteins in a 4% (w/v) slurry treated with 0.2-1.0% of GABA at 80, 90, and 100 degrees C. The addition of GABA significantly (P<0.05) reduced the average particle size and increased the zeta-potentialand intrinsic fluorescence intensity of the soy protein slurries. GABA treatment resulted in concentration-dependent increases (P < 0.05) in soy protein solubility, viscosity, rheology, emulsifying and foaming properties. This study, for the first time, investigated the effects of GABA on the properties of soy proteins. The findings would be useful in soy product formulation when GABA is added as a functional ingredient.

AB Plastic multilayers are widely used for baby food packaging. However, it is important to consider that migration of food contact materials (FCM) into the baby food can occur. The comprehensive identification of potential migrants, including intentionally added substances (IAS) and non-intentionally added substances (NIAS), is required to assess the safety of these packaging materials. In this study, high resolution accurate mass spectrometry (HRAMS) with a data-independent acquisition method of sequential mass windows enables the detection of substances with corresponding deconvoluted fragment mass spectra. The identification of unexpected migrants present in the food simulants and in real baby food was facilitated by filtering strategies and by an inhouse library. This approach has allowed the identification of 42 migrants, including eight NIAS detected for the first time. Two oligomers were quantified by means of reference standard materials at concentration levels above 0.010 mg/kg, exceeding the maximum residue levels for baby food.

AB A method combining solid-liquid extraction based on ethanolic aqueous solution, cLC-DAD and chemometrics, was performed to extract and quantify polyphenols from citrus peels. LC-MS/MS was also employed for chemical profiling.
   The effect of extraction variables on the recovery was examined by experimental factorial design. Data were evaluated using multifactorial-ANOVA, response surface analysis and Principal Component Analysis.
   trans-Ferulic and p-coumaric antioxidants were found in lower quantities (<1.4 mg.g(-1)) in all peel extracts. Narangin flavonoid was also identified in all samples, while rutin flavonol was determined in the concentration range of 3.3-4.7 mg.g(-1). The most abundant polyphenol in the extracts obtained from all evaluated citrus samples was the flavanone hesperidin (280-673 mg.g(-1)). Furthermore, peel extracts were evaluated in terms of total polyphenol and flavonoid content, total antioxidant activity and DPPH free radical scavenging.
   The obtained results suggested that evaluated citrus peel by-products could be reused as a source of polyphenols and transformed into value-added products.

AB While fleshy fruit softening has long been mechanistically linked to cell wall disassembly, the importance of the fruit cuticle in water relations and firmness has been suggested through studies of the long-shelf life delayed fruit deterioration (dfd) tomato genotype. We tested the hypothesis that dynamic cuticle properties and composition affect tomato fruit transpiration and firmness and are influenced by environmental water availability, using dfd and two normally softening fruit cultivars, Ailsa Craig (AC) and M82, grown under control and water stress (WS) conditions. The effect of WS was also assessed following fruit detachment. WS increased fruit firmness, cuticle load, and the expression of cuticle biosynthetic genes, while reducing cuticle permeability and fruit transpiration rate in AC and M82, but not in dfd fruit. This study supports a direct relationship between fruit cuticle properties, transpiration and firmness, and provides insights into the adaptation of tomato genotypes to environments where water can be scarce.

AB A novel gene aga3027 from the genome of Flammeovirga sp. OC4, isolated from the deep sea, was screened and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. This gene encoded the genetic information of a potential agarase that consists of 851 amino acids and belongs to 16 beta-agarase family of glycoside hydrolase. Purified recombinant Aga3027 demonstrated the maximum activity of agarase at 40 degrees C and pH 9.0, displaying excellent thermostability and pH-stability. The agarase retained more than 80% of its maximum activity after incubation at 30-40 degrees C for 48 h, or after incubation at pH 6.0-9.0 for 60 min, which indicated that this agarase was suitable for industrial applications. Silica gel chromatography was used to purify the hydrolysates of agar treated by agarase from the recombinant Aga3027. The hydrolysates were identified as neoagarotetraose and neoagarohexaose by thin layer chromatography and further confirmed by ion chromatography.

TI Effects of L-arginine and L-histidine on heat-induced aggregation of

AB This research focused on the effects of L-arginine (L-Arg) and L-histidine (L-His) on the heat-induced aggregation of fish myosin. L-Arg/L-His increased the pH of the myosin solution from 6.82 to 8.74 and 7.24, respectively, and decreased the turbidity, aggregate size, shear modulus, and breaking force. The incorporation of L-Arg/L-His decreased the surface hydrophobicity during setting, but increased it during the two-step heating. The heat-induced aggregation of myosin was suppressed by both amino acids, with the inhibitory effect being greater for L-Arg than L-His. On one hand, the change in the pH played a critical role in suppressing the heat-induced aggregation of myosin. On the other hand, the characteristics of L-Arg/L-His themselves, such as net charges and particular R-groups, were another main contributor to aggregation suppression. Particularly, L-Arg/L-His could interact with exposed aromatic residues of myosin, and the interactions may dominate and overwhelm the burial of aromatic residues during two-step heating.

AB Dual-pulse laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (DPLIBS) and chemometric methods were used to predict chromium content in rice leaves, along with the purpose for increasing the detection sensitivity and accuracy. The influence of important parameters in DPLIBS were investigated and optimized. Then, partial least square (PLS) was used to establish chromium content prediction models, and the value of regression coefficient based on PLS was applied to determine feature variables. In addition, multivariate and univariate analysis were used to verify the modeling performance of selected feature variables. The results indicated that support vector machine model based on feature variables achieved the best performance, with correlation coefficient of 0.9946, root mean square error of 4.85 mg/kg and residual predictive deviation of 9.70 in prediction set. The proposed method provides a high-accuracy and fast approach for chromium content prediction in rice leaves, which could potentially be used for toxic and nutrient elements detection in food.

AB This review collates the scientific literature regarding organic and biodynamic wines. It concerns techniques that allow organic or biodynamic wines to be distinguished from conventional products. Other aspects of the organic wines addressed include the antioxidant capacities and the content of compounds potentially toxic to human health, like metals, such as copper, deriving from treatments in the vineyard, or ochratoxin A and biogenic amines. Organic wines, in which, unlike non-organic wines, the SO2 must be lower or absent, may undergo premature ageing and present high levels of oxidation compounds. Some authors used selected indigenous yeasts to reduce the production of these molecules and improve the organoleptic quality of the wine. Also, the effects of biodynamic viticulture practices on the chemical and sensory characteristics of wines are compared with other conventional or organic products. With the growing market interest, differences among conventional, organic and, moreover, biodynamic wines, require more in-depth analysis.

AB The inclusion of edible wild plants in human diet has been receiving an increasing attention, as they represent an easily accessible source of nutrients, vitamins and antioxidants. In this work, the leaves of Umbelicus rupestris (Salisb.) Dandy, an edible species for which only scarce data is available in literature, were thoroughly evaluated for its nutritional profile, chemical characterization and bioactive properties. Being considered a succulent plant, the leaves revealed a very high content of moisture, with several beneficial compounds, including omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, tocopherols and different polyphenols. A total of twelve flavonoids, three phenolic acids and one phenylpropanoid glucoside were identified in the decoction and/or hydroethanolic extracts, with most of them being described for the first time in this plant. Both extracts showed antioxidant activity and potential to inhibit some of the assayed bacteria, while not presenting cytotoxic effects on a non-tumour primary cell culture.

AB The detailed phenolic composition of different berry parts from two novel V. vinifera L. red grape genotypes (Moribel and Tinto Fragoso), together the well-known Tempranillo, was established using high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS) over two consecutive vintages (2016 and 2017). More than 50 phenolic compounds were identified and quantified: 25 anthocyanins, 17 flavonols, 7 hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, 2 stilbenes, and several flavan-3-ols. As far as we know, some anthocyanin and flavonol dihexosides were reported for the first time in V. vinifera L. grapes. Application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to experimental data showed a good separation of the novel grape genotypes and Tempranillo according to the phenolic profile of skins and seeds, mainly based on the proportion of trisubstituted anthocyanin derivatives, flavonols and flavan-3-ols, being a useful tool to differentiate these grape varieties.

AB This study was conducted to investigate the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum NJAU-01 isolated from Chinese drycured ham (Jinhua ham) on the regulation of protein oxidation of fermented sausages. Fermented sausages were prepared with different concentrations of L. plantarum NJAU-01 (10(5) CFU/g, 10(7) CFU/g and 10(9) CFU/g), and the commercial strain was used as positive control. The results showed that L. plantarum NJAU-01 at 10(7) CFU/g and 10(9) CFU/g significantly lowered the protein carbonyl content and protein surface hydrophobicity compared with the control (P < 0.05). The total sulfhydryl contents in L. plantarum NJAU-01 groups were significantly higher than that of the group without starter culture (P < 0.05). Significant changes were found in sarcoplasmic protein bands within 130-250 kDa, 100-130 kDa and 25-35 kDa during sausage fermentation (P < 0.05). Our data suggest that L. plantarum NJAU-01 has the potential to be an antioxidant starter culture in fermented sausages.

AB In liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics, data matrices with up to thousands of variables for each ion peak are subjected to multivariate analysis (MVA) to assess the homogeneity between samples. The large dimensions of LC/MS datasets hinder the identification of the discriminant or the metabolic markers. In the present study, the molecular network (MN) approach and two in silico annotation tools, network annotation propagation (NAP) and the hierarchical chemical classification method, ClassyFire, were used to annotate the metabolites of three Zanthoxylum species, Z. bungeanum, Z. schinifolium and Z. piperitum. The in silico annotation results of the MN nodes and the MVA variables were combined and visualized in loading plots. This approach helped intuitive detection of the variables that greatly contributed to the separation of the samples in the score plot as discriminant or metabolic markers, thereby allowing rapid annotation of two flavanone derivatives.

AB The work studies the effect of season, montanera length, and sampling location on the Iberian pig fat, using compositional data (CoDa) analysis and standard statistics. CoDa variation array and logratios involving C18:3: (C18:3/C17:1), (C18:3/C20:0), and (C18:3/18:0) as well as the ilr balances (coordinates), based on C18:3, C17:1, and C20:0, showed the highest variances. Discriminant Analysis (DA) led to similar (conventional/coordinates) correct assignations regarding seasons (69/70%), montanera length (71/70%) and sampling location (68/67%). Re-analyzing the subcomposition of only the major fatty acids (FAs), led to slightly poorer results; therefore, the removed FAs might play a role in segregation. Results are in line with those from other authors and could indicate a partial capacity of pigs to control their FA profiles. Overall, CoDa analysis provided useful information on data variability, the effects of factors and, after conversion into coordinates, allowed applying standard statistics while being respectful with the compositional sampling space.

ID SECONDARY METABOLITES; IDENTIFICATION
AB Saffron is appreciated by its colour, taste, and aroma. To examine the effect of abiotic and biotic stress on these main properties, in the span of 2014-2016, saffron stigmas were collected from major different saffron cultivation areas of Iran and saffron quality was estimated. The quality of saffron was assessed by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy following the ISO3632:2011 standard. However, the composition and concentration of crocetin esters, picrocrocin, safranal, and kaempferols, the most critical compounds determining the properties and quality of saffron can vary with the geographical origin and virus effects, being more accurate High-Performance Liquid Chromatography and Diode Array Detection (HPLC-DAD) methods were used to analyze saffron quality. Using HPLC-DAD we analyzed saffron plants grown at various conditions (considering altitude, temperature, and precipitation/rainfall) and in presence/absence of virus infections; we found that edaphoclimatic and cultivation conditions significantly determine the quality of the spice and the presence of virus modifies the content of its metabolites.

AB A simple and rapid method for animal species identification to prevent food adulteration based on mitochondrial DNA using two independent multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) and microchip electrophoresis was developed. This method was designed to identify fourteen domestic animals (Group I: cattle, donkey, dog, fox, raccoon-dog, deer and horse; Group II: pig, sheep, goat, chicken, duck, cat and mouse) simultaneously using ten pairs of primers and three of which were degenerate primers. Sequences for species-specific primers were generated based on mitochondrial genes, including 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, ND2 and CO I. This method was validated in terms of the specificity, sensitivity and practicability, and the developed multiplex PCR method was able to correctly identify animal species of raw meats and processed meat products. The detection limits of two multiplex PCRs were 0.02 ng DNA for animal species in Group I and 0.2 ng DNA for Group II, respectively.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the variations in sugar content and identify the polymorphism in vacuolar invertase inhibitor (INH2) gene from Indian non-processing (Kufri Jyoti, Kufri Pukhraj and PU1) and exotic processing (Atlantic and Frito Lay-1533) potato cultivars. Upon cold storage (4 degrees C) processing cultivars maintained low reducing sugars as compared to non-processing cultivars. Sequencing of the INH2 gene identified four alleles of which three identified as novel alleles. A total twelve SNPs resulted in silent mutations, with five conferring the amino acid substitutions. Phylogenetic analysis suggests a highly conserved nature of the INH2 gene. The 3D predicted structures generated for all the alleles revealed slight variations in the orientation of the helices (alpha 1-3) in N-terminal region. Sequence polymorphism observed in INH2 alleles in processing and non-processing potato cultivars can be correlated with the observed variations in the sugar content suggesting a possible role in cold-induced sweetening.

AB Consumption of Brassica vegetables is linked to health benefits, as they contain high concentrations of the following secondary plant metabolites (SPMs): glucosinolate breakdown products, carotenoids, chlorophylls, and phenolic compounds. Especially Brassica vegetables are consumed as microgreens (developed cotyledons). It was investigated how different ontogenetic stages (microgreens or leaves) of pak choi (Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis) and kale (Brassica oleracea var. sabellica) differ in their SPM concentration. The impact of breadmaking on SPMs in microgreens (7 days) and leaves (14 days) in pak choi and kale as a supplement in mixed wheat bread was assessed. In leaves, carotenoids, chlorophylls, and phenolic compounds were higher compared to those of microgreens. Breadmaking caused a decrease of SPMs. Chlorophyll degradation was observed, leading to pheophytin and pyropheophytin formation. In kale, sinapoylgentiobiose, a hydroxycinnamic acid derivative, concentration increased. Thus, leaves of Brassica species are suitable as natural ingredients for enhancing bioactive SPM concentrations in bread.

AB Effects of natural phenolics on the shelf life of dried scallop adductor muscle predicted by accelerated shelf life testing (ALST) combined with Arrhenius model were investigated. This allows the food industries to reliably and rapidly determine the shelf life of dried shellfish species treated with antioxidants. The shelf life of dried scallop adductor muscle treated with antioxidants of bamboo leaves (AOB) and tea polyphenols (TP) was more than 1.70-fold that of dried control scallop adductor muscle. Thus, the highly nutritional value of dried scallop adductor muscle, based on its lipid constituents, is maintained during storage. OXITEST method further confirmed the improvement of lipid stability of antioxidant treated dried scallop adductor muscle by protecting polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, against autoxidation. Moreover, the natural phenolics employed effectively limited lipid oxidation by breaking the autoxidative chain reaction and/or inhibiting free radical formation in dried scallop adductor muscle during storage.

AB This study examined the effects of vacuum, ethanol pretreatment, and infrared-hot air drying methods on the characteristics and quality of scallion slices. The pretreatment of scallion includes four conditions: 1) Control: soaking in distilled water under normal pressure, 2) Ethanol: soaking in 75% ethanol under normal pressure, 3) Water + VC: soaking in distilled water under a vacuum of 0.6 bar, 4) Ethanol + VC: soaking in 75% ethanol under a vacuum of 0.6 bar. The pretreatment times were 5, 10, 20 and 30 min. The drying process was done in an infrared hot air drying oven at 60 degrees C. The ethanol pretreated samples exhibited better rehydration, odor, vitamin C retention, bactericidal effect and significantly reduced drying time. Water + VC samples showed better scallion morphology and color. Ethanol + VC samples showed the combined advantages of ethanol and Water + VC pretreatments. Therefore, Ethanol + VC pretreatment can significantly improve the drying rate and quality of scallion.

AB Aerial surfaces of plants are covered by a waxy cuticle protecting plants from excessive water loss and UV light. In the present study, composition and morphology of cuticular waxes of northern wild berry species bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.), lingonberry (V. vitis-idaea L.), bog bilberry (V. uliginosum L.) and crowberry (Empetrum nigrum L.) were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed differences in epicuticular wax morphology, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis confirmed variation in chemical composition of cuticular waxes between the berry species. The dominant compounds in bilberry and lingonberry cuticular waxes were triterpenoids, while fatty acids and alkanes were the dominant ones in bog bilberry and crowberry, respectively. Wax extracted by supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) from industrial press cakes of bilberry and lingonberry contained linoleic acid and.-linolenic acid as the dominant compounds. Furthermore, in vitro sun protection factor (SPF) of berry waxes depicted good UV-B absorbing capacities.

AB The aroma stability of fresh coffee brew was investigated during storage over 60 min, there was a substantial reduction in available 2-furfurylthiol (2-FFT) (84%), methanethiol (72%), 3-methyl-1H-pyrole (68%) and an increase of 2-pentylfuran (65%). It is proposed that 2-FFT was reduced through reversible chemical binding and irreversible losses. Bound 2-FFT was released after cysteine addition, thereby demonstrating that a reversible binding reaction was the dominant mechanism of 2-FFT loss in natural coffee brew. The reduction in available 2-FFT was investigated at different pH and temperatures. At high pH, the reversible binding of 2-FFT was shown to protect 2-FFT from irreversible losses, while irreversible losses led to the reduction of total 2-FFT at low pH. A model reaction system was developed and a potential conjugate, hydroxyhydroquinone, was reacted with 2-FFT. Hydroxyhydroquinone also showed 2-FFT was released after cysteine addition at high pH.

AB Kefir is a fermented dairy product, associated to health benefits because of being a probiotic and due to the presence of molecules with biological activity. In this work, we have profiled the peptide composition of goat milk kefir at three different fermentation times using a peptidomics approach, in order to study changes in peptide concentrations and patterns of protein digestion throughout the fermentation time. We identified 2328 unique peptides corresponding to 22 protein annotations, with a maximum of peptides found after 24 h fermentation. We established different digestion patterns according to the nature of the proteins, and quantified the changes in the peptides appearing in all the fermentation times. We also identified 11 peptides that matched exactly to sequences with biological activity in databases, almost all of them belonging to caseins. This is the most comprehensive proteomic analysis of goat milk kefir to date.

AB Physicochemical properties and emulsion stability of octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA)-modified partial waxy rice Baegjinju starches which were made with different OSA additions and the color stability of the encapsulated paprika pigment powder using the OSA starch were investigated. The DSs of the OSA starches ranged from 0.0152 to 0.0269. The band at 3303 cm(-1) reduced as the OSA levels increased, but the A-type crystallinity was maintained. The oil absorption and emulsion stability, the short chain (DP6-12) amylopectin, the resistant starch levels, and the peak and final viscosities increased as the OSA levels increased. The encapsulated pigment powder with freeze-drying had higher color stability and better emulsion, and heating stabilities occurred with spray drying and the native pigment. From these results, it is suggested that the OSA-modified Baegjinju rice starch is a good wall material to protect lipophilic carotenoids. The encapsulated pigment powders could be used as stable natural colorants.

AB By inspecting starch hierarchical structural evolutions, this work explores how microwave cooking with storage tailors the slowly digestible features of indica (IRS) and waxy (WRS) rice starches. Particularly, relative to conventional cooking-storage, the microwave treatment especially at high powers (8 and 10 W/g) increased the molecular orders (crystallites) and periodic amorphous-crystalline structures. Such changes facilitated the formation of domains with intermediately-densely packed starch chains, being modestly accessible to the diffusion, absorption and catalysis of enzymes and dominantly showing slowly digestible features. Consistently, the microwave processed starches showed a higher SDS (slowly digestible starch) level and a lower digestion rate. This microwave-enhanced SDS generation became more prominent for IRS, and the treated IRS at 10 W/g showed the highest SDS content (ca. 54%). This is related to the enhanced reassembly of glucan chains into ordered/semicrystalline structures and the formation of slowly digestible domains as induced by the increase of amylose molecules.

AB The eating and cooking quality (ECQ) of stored rice grains is significantly affected by ageing, but the molecular mechanisms for this are not well understood. In the present study, changes of starch hierarchical structures and thermal properties of starch were investigated for rices with up to 12 months storage. For the first time, it was seen that storage resulted in molecular degradation of starch. This mainly involved shorter amylose chains and around (1 -> 6)-alpha glycosidic branching points of amylopectin, which altered the crystalline structure. This resulted in lower gelatinization temperatures and enthalpy but higher crystalline heterogeneity. The ageing effect was varietally-dependent. The information obtained from this study offers improved molecular-level understanding of the effects of ageing process on rice cooking and eating qualities.

AB Fining treatment with polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) is often used during winemaking of rose wines. It can modulate the intensity and hue of their pink color and prevent some organoleptic degradations. In this paper, the effect of PVPP treatments on rose wine during fermentation was investigated by measuring color, polyphenol content and thiol aromas. As expected, colorimetry results showed a decrease in color, indicating some adsorption of anthocyanins and other pigments. This was confirmed by UPLC-ESI-MS/MS analyses. Specific adsorption of certain families of polyphenols was evidenced. Flavonols, flavanols and anthocyanins, especially coumaroylated anthocyanins were preferentially adsorbed by PVPP. The thiol content (3-sulfanylhexyl acetate (3SHA) and 3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol (3SH)) was usually higher after PVPP treatments, in a dose dependent manner. A possible explanation is that the partial adsorption of some polyphenols at an early stage of fermentation would later limit the amount of quinone compounds able to trap thiol aromas.

AB The effect of temperature on thermal inactivation of microorganisms and thermal degradation of certain chemical compounds can be either described by the Arrhenius model for the rate constant (k) or by the D/z model for the decimal reduction time (D). Although equivalent, it is difficult to directly reconcile these two models which have different model structures. This study hypothesized that the two models can be reconciled by linearization of the inverse of absolute temperature (1/T) and heating temperature (T), and the activation energy (E-a) can be directly calculated from z and their relationship is independent of T. The hypothesis was validated using the z and E-a of various chemical compounds, enzymes, and vegetative cells and spores of microorganisms in various substrates published in the literature. The results of this study show that the empirical models are practically reconciled.

AB The Lentinus edodes species, known as shiitake, has a history of extensive use in many cuisines in several East Asian countries owing to its unique and pleasant flavor and texture. As international food trade increases, reliable discrimination of geographical origin is becoming increasingly crucial in Korea to identify cheaper imported Chinese shiitake. Herein, stable isotope ratios (i.e., delta C-13, delta N-15, delta O-18, and delta S-34) were measured with a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer, and a geographical discrimination method using orthogonal projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis was developed. The externally validated discrimination method showed excellent predictability (Q(cum)(2) = 0.881) and illustrated that delta O-18 and delta N-15 were important isotope markers for the geographical discrimination of dried shiitake slices. This study extends the knowledge of geographical differences between China and Korea evidenced by the shiitake isotope signatures, thereby contributing to potential geographical authentication with broader applications for international shiitake markets.

AB Chayote, the fruit of Sechium edule (Jacq.) Swartz, is known for culinary applications and in traditional medicine. A great number of its health benefits have been related to its phenolic composition. However, literature concerning the characterization of phenolic compounds in chayote is scarce. Therefore, this work highlights new information about the composition of chayote. For that, different hydro-alcoholic mixtures (50-100% ethanol content) were used to recover phenolic compounds by ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) and the platform HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS was employed to characterize these components in the fruit. Briefly, 26 compounds, classified as phenolic acids, flavonoids and other polar compounds were identified in the fruit. About the effect of ethanol ratio on phenolic extraction, 70% ethanol exhibited the best recovery of target compounds (188 +/- 2 mg/100 g fruit d.w.). Chayote is rich in flavones accounting for a 60.6% from the total compounds quantified and the major compound is diosmetin 7-O-rutinoside (23.8%).

AB This study aimed to investigate the effect of stunning stress on textural properties and water-holding capacity (WHC) of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) fillets and its underlying mechanisms based on intrinsic proteases activity, myofibril microstructure, and myowater dynamic measurements. The results suggested that compared with the non-stressful percussion, ice/water and gill cut stunning resulted in accelerated muscle tenderization with intensive myofibril disintegration and sarcolemma-myofibril detachments. Myowater mobility and distribution were altered by stunning stress, in which gill cut facilitated the migration of immobilized water and free water, thus enhancing the centrifugation loss. In addition, stunning stress promoted the activation of endogenous proteases and the release of cathepsin B and L from lysosomes to myofibrils, which showed significant (P < 0.01) correlations with decreased shear force and elevated myofibril fragmentation index of fillets. Therefore, faster accumulation of cathepsins and myofibril disintegration together contributed to the weakening of texture and WHC in stunning-stressed fish fillets.

AB In this work, new detection route for ascorbic acid was designed. First, highly luminescent sulfur and nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots (S, N-GQDs) were prepared via simple hydrothermal method using citric acid and thiourea as the C, N and S sources respectively. The prepared S, N-GQDs are characterized by XRD, HRTEM, FTIR, EDS and PL. Investigations showed that prepared S, N-GQDs have a good photostability and excitation-dependent emission fluorescence. Prepared S, N-GQDs showed maximum excitation wavelength and emission wavelength at 400 and 462 nm, respectively. In the following, prepared S, N-GQDs were applied as a photoluminescence probe for detection of ascorbic acid (AA). The designed sensor was based on "off-on" detection mode. The developed sensor had a linear response to AA over a concentration range of 10-500 mu M with a detection limit of 1.2 mu M. The regression equation is Y= 0.0014 X + 1.2036, where Y and X denote the fluorescence peak intensity and AA concentration, respectively.

AB Black cumin seed (BCS) is a novel oil source with potential health benefits. This study investigates the influence of infrared (IR) and dry air (DA) roasting (140, 160 and 180 degrees C for 5 and 10 min) on BCS oil quality characteristics. Results revealed that the oxidative stability index (OSI), Maillard reaction products (MRPs), chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were increased while acid value (AV), peroxide value (PV) and color values were decreased in DA roasted (180 degrees C for 10 min) BCS oil compared to other DA and IR treatments. DA and IR roasting slightly influenced the fatty acid composition (FAC) of BCS oils. FTIR spectra showed minor changes in peak intensities (at 2854, 2929 and 3008 cm(-1)) of DA and IR roasted BCS oils. DA roasting proved more effective than IR roasting. The oil from the DA roasted BCS at 180 degrees C for 10 min had significantly higher oil quality and oxidative stability.

AB The retrogradation behaviors and molecular structures of lotus seed starch (LS) combined with different hydrocolloids, chitosan (CS), guar gum (GG) and xanthan (XN), were investigated. Following an autoclave treatment, the storage modulus (G') value of LS-CS increased more rapidly than LS alone, indicating an increase in starch retrogradation. This might result from intermolecular interactions, increased ordered structure, decreased weight-average molecular weight (M-w) and greater leached amylose content in LS-CS system. The LS-GG and particularly LS-XN blends showed the opposite trend. The much greater M-w of LS-XN was mainly attributed to the lower retrogradation rate. The enwrapping effect of GG or XN on LS, as observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, might retard their retrogradation by limiting the granules' swelling and the amylose leaching. Overall, the changes in the interaction force, ordered structure, M-w, leached amylose and microstructure were related to retrogradation behaviors of LS-hydrocolloid blends following an autoclave treatment.

AB Hydroxypropyl (HP) starches are used as thickeners and stabilizers in foods. The properties of the etherified starches are dependent on the degree of hydroxypropylation. The objective of this study was to develop an improved acid hydrolysis method to degrade and solubilize HP starches for determining HP content in modified starches by H-1 NMR. The effects of acid (DCl) concentration and temperature on hydrolysis and solubilization of hydroxypropylated starches were examined. The optimal conditions proposed to hydrolyze HP starches were 10% starch solid content, 3.5% (wt%) DCl in D2O as the solvent, sodium acetate as an internal standard, and heating at 90 degrees C for 1 h. Optionally, 6% (v/v) TFA-d may be added as the water-peak shifting reagent. Six hydroxypropylated starches and two cross-linked and hydroxypropylated starches were hydrolyzed with this improved acid method, and the results of the HP content were in agreement with those from an enzyme-catalyzed method.

AB Enzyme specificity and particularity is needed not only in enzymatic separation methods, but also in enzymatic determination methods for plant compound extraction. Stevioside, rubusoside, and rebaudioside A are natural sweet compounds from plants. These compounds have the same skeleton and only contain different side-chain glucosyl groups, making them difficult to separate. However, enzymes that target diterpenoid compounds and show specific activity for side-chain glucosyl groups are rare. Herein, we report the identification and characterization of an enzyme that can target both diterpenoid compounds and sophorose, namely, beta-glucosidase SPBGL1 from Sphingomonas elodea ATCC 31461. SPBGL1 displayed high specificity toward sophorose, and activity toward stevioside, but not rebaudioside A. The stevioside conversion rate was 98%. SPBGL1 also operated at high substrate concentrations, such as in 50% crude steviol glycoside extract. Glucose liberated from stevioside was easy to quantify using the glucose oxidase method, allowing the stevioside content to be determined.

AB Fish scales are usually discarded or used to produce fish meal, etc. In order to enhance their utility, we produced the gelatin hydrolysates from fish scales (FSGH) and they were heated with glucose, xylose, and ribose to prepare sugar-FSGH Maillard reaction products (MRPs). The antioxidant capacity and sensory property of MRPs were evaluated. The results showed that ribose-FSGH MRPs exhibited higher antioxidant capacity than glucose-and xylose-FSGH MRPs. After simulated gastrointestinal digestion, the DPPH and ABTS scavenging activity of ribose-FSGH MRPs were 25.32 mu M and 193.37 mu M Trolox equivalent/g sample, respectively, and the reducing power was 0.509. Flavor compounds (such as butanal, benzaldehyde, 2-methyl-3-furanthiol, and maltol) of ribose-FSGH MRPs were produced in abundance after 5 h of heating and ribose-FSGH MRPs exhibited flavor enhanced effect on caramel-like and mouthfulness sensory attributes. These results suggest that ribose-FSGH MRPs can be potentially used as food antioxidants.

AB Chemical composition, thermal, pasting, and moisture adsorption properties of flours from chickpea (Cicer aretinium L.), lentil (Lens culinaris Merr.), and yellow pea (Pisum sativum L.) were investigated over a 6-day germination. Protein content increased for pulses over germination while lentil had the highest protein content that increased from 30.65 to 33.60 g/100 g dry basis (d.b.). Lipid content in pulse flours decreased over germination with chickpea having the greatest decline, i.e. from 8.00 to 5.90 g/100 g (d.b.). Total starch decreased in lentil and yellow pea flours during germination, while there was no significant change (p > 0.05) in germinated chickpea flours. Thermal properties of pulse flours changed slightly, while pasting properties varied among pulses. The highest final viscosities for chickpea, lentil, and yellow pea flours were 1061, 981, and 1052 cP and were observed after 2, 1, and 0 days of germination, respectively. Moisture adsorption isotherms showed improved water adsorption capability after germination.

AB The encapsulation of eugenol (E) by spray-drying using whey protein (WP) or soy lecithin (LE) and maltodextrin in combination with oleic acid (OA) and chitosan (CH) was analysed in order to obtain antioxidant and antimicrobial powders for food applications. Formulations with only WP or LE showed higher encapsulation efficiencies (EE) (95-98%) and antibacterial effect against E. coli and L. innocua due to their greater E load. Incorporation of OA or CH promoted lower EE, which negatively affected the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of the powders. Furthermore, the addition of CH implied less thermal protection against the E losses. The eugenol release was not notably affected by pH or polarity of the food simulant, but the release rate significantly decreased when incorporating OA and CH. The E-LE formulations better retained the eugenol than E-WP powders when heated above 200 degrees C, this being relevant for the powder inclusion in thermally treated products.

AB The impact of Aqualysin 1 (Aq1), the thermo-active peptidase of Thermus aquaticus, on wheat albumin, globulin, gliadin and glutenin proteins during heat treatment of wheat dough and bread baking was examined. The level of protein extractable in sodium dodecyl sulfate containing medium under non-reducing conditions (SDS-EP-NR) from wheat dough decreases upon heating to a lesser extent when Aq1 is used than in control experiments. The higher SDS-EP-NR level is caused by the release by Aq1 of peptides from the repetitive gluten protein domains during baking. These peptides are also extractable from bread crumb with salt solution. The resultant thermoset gluten network in bread crumb is mainly made up by protein from non-repetitive gluten domains.

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) treatment after harvest on the activity of antioxidative enzymes and the phenylpropanoid pathway of blueberries. Blueberry fruits were dipped in 1.0 mmol/L SNP solution for 10 min and stored at 4 degrees C. Fruits treated with distilled water were used as the control. The results indicated that SNP significantly inhibited the increase of weight loss and enhanced the ascorbic acid content of blueberry fruit. Moreover, SNP increased the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase, polyphenol oxidase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, ascorbate peroxidase, peroxidase, and hydrogen peroxide in blueberry fruit. The accumulation of lignin and anthocyanin in the fruit was also stimulated by the SNP treatment. These results demonstrate that SNP treatment could maintain the antioxidant ability of blueberries by regulating the phenylpropanoid pathway and antioxidant enzymes.

AB In this study, the soybean milk and tofu byproduct okara was subjected to subcritical water extraction with the intention of recovering isoflavones with minimal degradation. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) of the extraction variables indicated that optimized conditions would be T= 146.23 degrees C, P= 3.98 MPa, and alpha = 20 mg (solid)/mL (extractant). Mathematical models for the conversion and degradation of isoflavones were solved as a set of simultaneous equations leading to rate constants and time-dependent concentration profiles for each genistein-and daidzein-based compound. These kinetic analyses suggested that an optimum extraction time, under RSM-optimized conditions, would be 213.5 +/- 8.7 min. The results of our study suggest that okara by-products could be valorized efficiently, as a source of bioactive isoflavone aglycones, using subcritical water. The mathematical models and optimized extraction conditions that we established in this study could be employed, as process control-optimized variables, in the exploitation of okara, specifically in the isolation of genistein and daidzein.

AB Penicillium glabrum GQ1-3 and Aspergillus oryzae HGPA20 isolated from home-made soybean pastes were separately inoculated into soybean paste subjected to brine fermentation for 90 days. The amino acid nitrogen contents of the two fermentation systems were detected every 10 days, and both reached the maximum level at 40 days. The samples fermented for 40 days were analyzed via gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry. Using univariate, multivariate and KEGG analyses, 72 differential metabolites were obtained, and 7 metabolic pathways closely related to fermentation were screened. The relative contents of 2-oxoglutarate, ornithine, glutamine, and citrulline were higher in GQ1-3, whereas those of L-homoserine, aspartic acid, and asparagine were higher in HGPA20. These findings indicate that a-ketoglutaric acid-derived amino acid synthesis is preponderant in GQ1-3, whereas oxaloacetate-derived type is predominant in HGPA20. The different pathways of amino acid synthesis lead to the distinct nutrients and umami substances in the fermented soybean pastes.

AB This work aimed to evaluate the in vitro effect of encapsulated oregano and clove essential oils on oil-in-water nanoemulsions against Zygosaccharomyces bailii. The antifungal efficacy of these nanoemulsions and their sensory acceptance were tested in salad dressings. Both essential oils were effective inhibitors against the target yeast, with minimal inhibitory and fungicidal concentrations of 1.75 mg/mL. In the in vitro assay done with the nanoemulsions, no yeast growth was observed for any tested essential oil concentration. In the salad dressings, all the formulations were able to reduce Z. bailii growth compared to the control, and only those samples with 1.95 mg/g of essential oil were capable of inhibiting yeast development after 4 inoculation days. The sensory acceptance of the dressing containing the nanoemulsions was similar to the control dressing in appearance, consistency and colour terms. These results evidence the antifungal activity of oregano and clove nanoemulsions against Z. bailii.

AB Sauvignon blanc grape samples (n = 21) from across a single Geographical Indication of South Australia were analysed for thiol precursors and amino acids, and fermented in an identical laboratory-scale fermentation trial to investigate the intraregional pattern of varietal thiols in the wines. Precursors and thiols exhibited obvious intraregional diversity, and notably, stronger correlations were observed between a number of amino acids and thiol precursors (especially with glutamic acid, r=-0.73) rather than free thiols. Additionally, pre-fermentation freezing (-20 degrees C, 1 month) was applied to five selected fresh grape samples and their juices, followed by identical fermentation. In comparison to wines from fresh grapes or frozen juices, significant elevation of varietal thiols (up to 10-fold) occurred in the wines derived from frozen grapes, with parallel increases of precursors (up to 19-fold) in juices from frozen berries. These novel results may lead to new strategies for thiol enhancement during winemaking.

AB The effect of Clitoria ternatea flower (CTE) incorporated into cooked rice using domestic cooking methods on starch digestibility was determined. The incorporation of 1.25% and 2.5% (w/v) CTE caused a reduction in the starch digestibility of cooked rice using an electric rice cooker. In addition, there was significant alteration on the starch digestibility of cooked rice incorporated with 2.5% CTE using a microwave oven. Moreover, CTE significantly reduced the level of rapidly digestible starch and increased the level of undigested starch in cooked rice using an electric rice cooker. In the textural characteristics, the hardness of cooked rice with CTE remained unchanged, whereas a reduction in stickiness of cooked rice with CTE was observed. The sensory evaluation of cooked rice with CTE given by panelists demonstrated a good overall acceptability. Overall, the results show that CTE is a useful ingredient to incorporate with cooked rice for reduction of starch digestibility.

AB Although beta-xylosidases have a wide range of applications, cold-active beta-xylosidases have been poorly studied. In this study, a cold active beta-xylosidase gene (xyl) from Bacillus pumilus TCCC 11,350 was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant XYL (rXYL) was revealed to be a bifunctional enzyme with both beta-xylosidase and a-L-arabinofuranosidase activities. Purified rXYL was most active at 30 degrees C, demonstrating 26% and 18% of its maximum activity at 4 degrees C and 0 degrees C, respectively. Meanwhile, rXYL showed a 52% activity in 200mM xylose, indicating a relatively strong tolerance to xylose. Moreover, rXYL exhibited a high synergistic effect (11.14-fold and 16.21-fold) with endo-xylanase to degrade beechwood xylan in both sequential and simultaneous reactions at low temperatures. As the first report on the novel cold-adapted beta-xylosidase from B. pumilus, these results suggested rXYL had attractive properties for food industrial utilizations.

AB The thermophysical properties and taste behavior of sucrose in aqueous ionic liquids {1-octyl-3-methyl imidazolium bromide and 1-octyl-3-methyl imidazolium chloride} solutions have been studied via volumetric, compressibility and viscometric properties at T=(288.15, 298.15, 308.15 and 318.15) K. The positive values of transfer volume and transfer partial molar isentropic compression indicated predominance of ionic-hydrophilic interactions in these systems. The calculated hydration number for sucrose demonstrated that dehydration of sucrose occurs in presence of both studied ionic liquids. Further, the effect of studied ionic liquids on the taste behaviour of sucrose has been discussed from ASV and ASIC parameters. Furthermore, interaction volume, V-int, and cavity volume, V-cav, have been computed from scaled particle theory (SPT).

AB The aim of this work was to develop and optimize a pH-responsive nanoparticle based on poly(D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and chitosan (CHIT) for delivery of natural antimicrobial using trans-cinnamaldehyde (TCIN) as a model compound. The optimization was performed using a central composite design and the desirability function approach. The optimized levels of variables considering all significant responses were 4% (w/w) of TCIN and 6.75% (w/w) of CHIT. After, optimized nanoparticles were produced and characterized according to their physicochemical properties and their antimicrobial activity against Salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. Optimized nanoparticles characterization indicated a satisfactory TCIN encapsulation (33.20 +/- 0.85%), spherical shape, pH-responsive controlled release, with faster release in the presence of CHIT at low pH, and enhanced antimicrobial activity against both pathogens. TCIN encapsulation using PLGA coated with CHIT enhanced its antimicrobial activity and generated a delivery system with pH-sensitivity for controlled release with promising properties for food safety applications.

AB Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated proteins (Cas) 9 system is a powerful tool for genome editing and still being aggressively improved. Cas12a, a recently discovered Cas9 ortholog, is expected to become complementary to Cas9 due to its unique characteristics. Previously we attempted to establish an adenovirus (Ad) vector-mediated delivery of CRISPR-Cas12a system since Ad vector is widely used for gene transfer in basic researches and medical applications. However, we found difficulties preparing of Ad vectors at an adequate titer. In this study, we have developed Ad vectors that conditionally express Cas12a either by a tetracycline-controlled promoter or a hepatocyte specific promoter to avoid putative inhibitory effects of Cas12a. These vectors successfully proliferated in packaging cells, HEK293 cells, and were recovered at high titers. We have also developed packaging cells that express shRNA for Cas12a to suppress expression of Cas12a. Using the cells, the Ad vector directing constitutive expression of Cas12a proliferated efficiently and was successfully recovered at a high titer. Overall, we improved recovery of Ad vectors carrying CRISPR-Cas12a system, thus provided them as a tool in genome editing researches.

AB Huimcola insolens cutinase (HiC) was heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. To avoid a carbon starvation step, fermentation was conducted using combinations of sorbitol with glycerol and methanol in the cell growth and induction phases, respectively. The cutinase productivity (27.71 U mL(-1) h(-1)) was 9.93 U mL(-1) h(-1) greater than that achieved using traditional two-phase methods, and a cutinase activity of 2660 U mL(-1), using pnitrophenyl butyrate as substrate, was achieved after only 96 h in a 3-L bioreactor. Subsequently, the combination of HiC with Thermobifida fusca cutinase (TfC) in cotton fabric bioscouring was evaluated by monitoring the wettability and dyeability of the fabric. Treatment with 20 U mL(-1) of HiC at 80 degrees C for 5 min followed by 30 U mL(-1) of TfC at 50 degrees C for 1 h gave the best results. The total treatment time was shorter and performance was better than those seen with the alkali method.

AB Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling can be applied to understand hydrodynamics in stirred suspension bioreactors, which can in turn affect cell viability, proliferation, pluripotency and differentiation. In this study, we developed a CFD model to determine the effects of average shear rates and turbulent eddies on the formation and growth of murine embryonic stem cell aggregates. We found a correlation between average eddy size and aggregate size, which depended on bioreactor agitation rates. By relating these computational and biological variables, CFD modeling can predict optimal agitation rates to grow embryonic stem cell aggregates in stirred suspension bioreactors. To examine the effect of hydrodynamics on pluripotency, mESCs cultured in bioreactors under various agitation rates were tested for SSEA-1, Sox-2, and Nanog expression. Cells maintained a minimum of 95% positive expression with no change in the intensity distribution pattern between the different bioreactor conditions. This indicates that the average level of pluripotency marker expression is independent of changes in the hydrodynamic profile and resulting aggregate size distribution. The findings here can be further extended to other cell types that grow as aggregates in stirred suspension bioreactors and offer important insights necessary to realize cell therapies.

AB The possibility of using active dry microbial preparations in biotechnological processes is essential for the development of new modern industrial technologies. In this study, we show the possibility of obtaining such preparations of the genetically engineered yeast strain Ogataea (Hansenula) polymorpha with glutathione overproduction. Special pre-treatment involving the gradual rehydration of dry cells in water vapour led to the restoration/reactivation of almost 100% of dehydrated cells. Furthermore, dry cells do not lose their viability during storage at room temperatures. Application of dry cells as the inoculum provides the same levels of glutathione synthesis as that of a native yeast culture.

AB 2,3-Butanediol (2,3-BD) can be produced at high titers by engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae by abolishing the ethanol biosynthetic pathway and introducing the bacterial butanediol-producing pathway. However, production of 2,3-BD instead of ethanol by engineered S. cerevisiae has resulted in glycerol production because of surplus NADH accumulation caused by a lower degree of reduction (gamma= 5.5) of 2,3-BD than that (gamma= 6) of ethanol. In order to eliminate glycerol production and resolve redox imbalance during 2,3-BD production, both GPD1 and GPD2 coding for glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenases were disrupted after overexpressing NADH oxidase from Lactococcus lactis. As disruption of the GPD genes caused growth defects due to limited supply of C-2 compounds, Candida tropicalis PDC1 was additionally introduced to provide a necessary amount of C-2 compounds while minimizing ethanol production. The resulting strain (BD5_ T2 nox_ dGPD1,2_ CtPDC1) produced 99.4 g/L of 2,3-BD with 0.5 g/L glycerol accumulation in a batch culture. The fed-batch fermentation led to production of 108.6 g/L 2,3-BD with a negligible amount of glycerol production, resulting in a high BD yield (0.462 g2,3-BD/gglucose) corresponding to 92.4 % of the theoretical yield. These results demonstrate that glycerol-free production of 2,3-BD by engineered yeast is feasible.

ID EXPRESSION; FUSION; PLANTS; TRANSFORMATION
AB Efficient coproduction of multiple proteins or their subunits is important in many facets of life sciences and biotechnology. Here, we report a novel approach that exploits the synergy between an engineered mini-intein and an ubiquitin variant to achieve coordinated coexpression of multiple proteins in eukaryotic hosts, from a single open reading frame that encodes a polyprotein precursor consisting of proteins of interest (POIs) connected by an intervening intein-ubiquitin fusion domain. The intein variant mediates highly active autocatalytic cleavage at its N-terminus, whereas the endogenous deubiquitinases cleave at ubiquitin's C-terminus, leading to the release of the POIs. Using fluorescent reporter proteins for proof-of-concept, utility of the intein-ubiquitin domain was validated in higher plants and yeast systems. Essentially complete release of the POIs was achieved as demonstrated with western blots. Proteins expressed using the intein-ubiquitin system potentially preserve their intended sequences, which is important for preventing alteration of POI function.

AB A novel type III fungal CAR was identified from the organism Thermothelomyces thermophila. High expression levels were observed in E. coli using the pETDuet-1 plasmid system in combination with an autoinduction protocol. A broad substrate scope ranging from aromatic to aliphatic carboxylic acids was tested and TtCAR showed activity for all substrates. High specific activities for aromatic substrates and short chain aliphatic substrates were observed, comparable to those of NcCAR, the first type III fungal CAR. TtCAR's pH and temperature optima were at 6.5 and 30 degrees C, respectively. Up to 20% (v/v) cosolvents did not show a decrease in specific activity of TtCAR using (E)-cinnamic acid as a substrate. Its half-life at 40 degrees C was determined to be 8.25 h and its melting temperature (T-m.) was 56 degrees C. In vitro reactions with TtCAR reduced 95.2% of 10mM vanillic acid, which correlated to a titer of 1.4 g L-1 of vanillin. The space time yield of 0.029 g L-1 h(-1) indicates that further improvements would be necessary for an industrially relevant application. This would be especially important when competing against de novo synthesis of bio vanillin by microbial strains producing > 30 g L-1. In de novo and in vivo biosynthesis systems, by-products are fairly common. By contrast, we were pleased to observe less than 0.7% of vanillyl alcohol formed, making the cell-free acid reduction in the envisaged sequential two-step bioconversion from eugenol to vanillin very attractive.

AB Carboxylic acid reductases (CARs) are valuable biocatalysts due to their ability to reduce a broad range of carboxylate substrates into the corresponding aldehyde products. CARs are multi-domain enzymes with separate catalytic domains for the adenylation and the subsequent reduction of substrates. Inter-domain dynamics are crucial for the catalytic activities of CARs. In this work, hybrid enzymes that contain domains from four bacterial CARs and one fungal CAR were constructed based on domain boundaries that were defined using a combination of bioinformatics and structural analysis. Hybrid CARs were characterized in both steady-state and transient kinetics studies using aromatic and straight-chain (C-3-C-5) carboxylate substrates. Kinetic data support that the inter-domain interactions play an important role in the function of both wild-type and hybrid CARs and further lead to the hypothesis that reduction is the rate-determining step in CAR catalysis. Our results provide both fundamental insights into CAR catalysis and rationale for hybrid CAR engineering.

AB Poly-gamma-glutamic acid (gamma-PGA) is a water-soluble, nontoxic biocompatible polymer, which is extensively used in medicines, foodstuffs, cosmetics, and in water treatment. We previously isolated a novel gamma-PGA producing strain Bacillus licheniformis RK14 from soil and developed a hyper-producing mutant strain RK14-46 by an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) treatment. In this study, endo-type (pgdS) and exo-type gamma-PGA hydrolases (ggt) were disrupted by integrating plasmids into the genomic DNA of B. licheniformis RK14-46 strain. Unexpectedly, we observed strong inhibition of gamma-PGA production following deletion of the pgdS gene, suggesting that pgdS is essential for gamma-PGA biosynthesis in strain RK14-46, and in its parent strain RK14. In contrast, gamma-PGA production increased by the deletion of the ggt gene and reached 39 g/L in the presence of 90 g/L glucose and elevated oxygen supply. Furthermore, gamma-PGA from the ggt-disrupted mutant (Delta ggt) maintained a larger molecular mass throughout the culture period, whereas that from the original RK14-46 strain had degraded after glucose consumption. gamma-PGA-containing culture supernatants from Delta ggt strain showed greater flocculation efficiency in sewage sludge than supernatants from the RK14-46 strain, reflecting greater production of gamma-PGA with larger molecular mass by the Delta ggt strain. This is the first report concerning the deletion of pgdS and ggt genes in B. licheniformis strain and the properties of gamma-PGA obtained from the mutant strain.

AB The Semliki Forest virus (SFV) viral vector has been widely used for transient protein expression. This study aimed to analyze comprehensively the capacity of SFV vector to express rabies lyssavirus glycoprotein (RVGP) in mammalian cells. The assessed parameters were transfection strategy, multiplicity of infection (MOI), harvest time and mammalian cell host. Two transfection approaches, electroporation and lipofection were evaluated to obtain the recombinant SFV, and the electroporation was found to be the most effective. Viral quantification by RT-qPCR was performed to elucidate the relation between the amount of recombinant virus utilized in the infection process and the production levels of the heterologous protein. Four different multiplicities of infection (MOIs = 1; 10; 15; 50) were evaluated using five mammalian cell lines: BHK-21, HuH-7, Vero, L929, and HEK-293T. Protein expression was assessed at two harvest times after infection (24 and 48 h). The recombinant protein generated was characterized by western blot, dot blot, and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), while its concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Similar expression patterns were observed in cell lines BHK-21, HEK-293T, L929, and Vero, with higher RVGP production in the first 24 h. The BHK-21 cells showed yields of up to 4.3 mu g per 10(6) cells when lower MOIs (1 and 10) were used. The HEK-293 T cells also showed similar production (4.3 mu g per 10(6) cells) with MOI of 1, while the L929 and Vero cell lines showed lower expression rates of 2.82 and 1.26 mu g per 10(6) cells, respectively. These cell lines showed lower expression levels at 48 h after infection compared to 24 h. Controversially, in the case of the HuH-7 cell line, RVGP production was higher at 48 h after infection (4.0 mu g per 10(6) cells) and using MOIs of 15 and 50. This work may contribute to optimize the RVGP production using SFV system in mammalian cells. This study can also substantiate for example, the development of approaches that use of SFV for applications for other protein expressions and suggests values for relevant parameters and cell lines of this biotechnique.

ID ANTIBODY; OPTIMIZATION; IMPACT
AB Secreted recombinant proteins can aggregate during cell culture. We studied a poorly-behaved bispecific scaffold that increasingly aggregated (up to 62% high molecular weight species, HMW) as a function of culture time in a fed-batch and intensified cell culture processes. We identified that protein aggregates increased with accumulated protein concentration inside the bioreactor. Furthermore, results indicated that a maximum product concentration was reached beyond which no additional soluble protein accumulated in culture even when doubling the integrated viable cell density with the intensified process, suggesting additional secreted protein was precipitating. To overcome this limitation and maintain the cell-specific productivity (q(p)) in culture, we explored a perfusion process where recombinant protein was continuously removed from the bioreactor to maintain low product concentration and consequently, minimize protein aggregation. We studied different viable cell densities (VCDs) inside the bioreactor (one to five-fold) and found a corresponding two-fold modulation of monomer levels. In all VCD conditions, q(p) was maintained. On the contrary, the previous intensified process showed an "apparent" 2.5-fold decrease in q(p) at the end of culture because of the presumed limited protein solubility at higher concentrations. The combination of lower aggregate levels and constant q(p) resulted in up to four to five-fold increase in recoverable product (i.e., monomer) with the improved perfusion process.

AB Carboxylic acid reductases (CARs) are an emerging biocatalyst platform for the synthesis of a diverse array of aldehydes from carboxylic acids, operating chemoselectively and under mild aqueous conditions. As such, there is growing interest in the industrial application of these enzymes, both for the synthesis of aldehyde end-products, which are particularly prevalent in the flavor and fragrance industries, and aldehyde intermediates in multi-enzyme cascades. This perspective aims to review recent developments in the applications of CARs with a focus on the challenges and considerations involved in their implementation, as well as potential solutions with a view to increased industrial utility.

AB The effect of sodium selenite on batch culture of Candida utilis CCTCC M 209298 was investigated. Cell growth was inhibited while glutathione biosynthesis and secretion were improved during selenium enrichment. To reveal the mechanism underlying the decrease in biomass and the increase in glutathione, both metabolic flux analysis of key intermediates involved in glutathione metabolic pathway and transcriptome analysis of C. utilis by RNA-seq were carried out for selenized cells and the control without selenium enrichment. Results indicated that sodium selenite decreased carbon fluxes towards biomass but increased fluxes towards amino acids for the biosynthesis of glutathione and related amino acids. Selenium enrichment down-regulated a large number of genes involved in cell components and the cell cycle, resulting in decreased biomass as well as increased cell permeability. Moreover, several genes associated with transportation, binding, and mitochondrial and ribosomal functions for energy metabolism and protein synthesis were up-regulated in the presence of sodium selenite. All of these results disclosed the physiological response of C. utilis to sodium selenite.

AB An innovative abuse-deterrent composition was developed to deter the most dangerous route of drug abuse, the intravenous route. The composition is based on a crosslinked sodium starch glycolate (X-SSG) that can effectively complex with cationic drugs in aqueous solutions and minimize the amount of the free drug available for extraction. Furthermore, the crosslinked polymer swells in and entraps a portion of the drug solution by which it reduces the available volume for syringing and subsequent injection. Two deterrent compositions were prepared, a drug-polymer physical blend and a drug-polymer chemical complex. The composition in its complexed form showed greater deterrence capacity than the physical blend except in solvents with ionic moieties, where the deterrence remained almost the same. The studies revealed that the complexation with the drug played a major role in total drug entrapment. Tablets prepared from the drug-polymer complex showed a complete and immediate drug release in 0.1 N HCl within the first 15 min. Moreover, the dissolution studies in the simulated intestinal media ruled out the re-complexation potential between the drug and the polymer. The proposed X-SSG composition provides a desirable drug release in the gastric and intestinal media under the legitimate use while deterring an intravenous abuse.

AB The aim of this research was to formulate a novel nano-micellar complex carrier with intrinsically enhanced intestinal permeability for rosuvastatin calcium (RSV); as a model of BCS class III active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The model drug is used primarily for treating hypercholesterolemia. Three phospholipid types with different degrees of saturation were chosen for the study. The saturation degree of the phospholipids was calculated accurately by proton NMR. A D-optimal statistical design was utilized to correlate the saturation degree of the phospholipids with the physico-chemical characteristics of the prepared nano-micellar carrier. The nature of the interaction between the phospholipids and the model drug was studied by proton NMR, photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to understand the formation mechanism of the complex micelles on a molecular level. The results demonstrated that the interaction of the hydrophilic drug molecule with the polar head of a saturated phospholipid induces an intramolecular self-coiling of phospholipid saturated acyl chain leading to a structural transformation from a two-tailed cylindrical configuration into a one-tailed, surfactant-like configuration owing to the flexibility of the saturated chains. This transformation leads to the construction of a novel nano-micellar structure in which the drug has lower water solubility but higher lipophilicity than in traditional micelles. Permeability studies conducted on Caco-2 cells demonstrated that the novel nano-micellar carrier had superior permeability to that of the un-complexed hydrophilic drug. The optimized nano-micellar formulation showed significantly (P < 0.5) superior bioavailability in rats to that of the aqueous drug solution in terms of both the rate and extent of drug absorption. Overall, the results confirmed that the formation of the phospholipid nano-micellar complex increased the permeability of the hydrophilic BCS class III drug and converted it to a class BCS I drug by a simple and effective formulation technique.

AB In this study, we evaluated a novel combination of drug delivery devices composed of holo-transferrin conjugated liposomes for siRNA (36 nM) delivery, and electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL)-gelatin (GT) microfibers for resveratrol (40 mu M) release. Single- and co-cultures of cancerous K562 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used to test the efficacy and targeting over eight days. BCR-ABL siRNA-encapsulated (36 nM) holo-transferrin-conjugated PEG-liposomes were characterized using dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. RT-qPCR was performed to assess the silencing BCR-ABL gene. Two treatment protocols were explored: i) simultaneous administration ii) delayed liposomes addition by three days based on resveratrol release profile. Formed liposomes were 123 ( +/- 6.65) nm in diameter, holo-transferrin conjugation efficiency was 85.9 ( +/- 7.30)%, and siRNA loading efficiency was 92.3 ( +/- 2.57)%. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (SIP) content was analyzed by ELISA. Targeted siRNA release in combination with resveratrol release was more potent and has long-term effects compared to bolus doses. Delayed addition of liposomes increased non-viability of K562 cells to 92.7 ( +/- 2.00)% and 94.32 ( +/- 1.70)%, in the absence and presence of HUVECs, respectively. HUVECs non-viability level was significantly lower. Using two different delivery devices approach has a broader impact on cancer treatment.

AB This project aimed to develop a suspension vehicle specifically designed for pediatric use. Excipients were selected according to their safety and recorded use in pediatrics. Two suspension vehicles were formulated at neutral and acidic pH. A few compositions were defined, and their physicochemical properties assessed and compared to readily-available commercial vehicles.
   As required for a multidose oral formulation, an antimicrobial effectiveness WA was conducted according to the USP. Different microbial strains were inoculated individually in each formulation and their concentrations monitored for 28 days. Propionic acid proved to be an effective preservative against all tested strains at pH 4.5. All tested preservative failed the WA at pH 7.5.
   The final version of the novel vehicle presented a pH of 4.5 and a viscosity of 85 cP at 25 degrees C. A clear shearthinning behaviour could be observed. These properties warranted an adequate physical stability and resuspendability, when tested with prednisolone and acetaminophen tablets. A slight reduction of the viscosity was reported when stored at room temperature, but the pH remained constant for 180 days in refrigerated conditions and at room temperature. The final result is a ready-to-use compounding vehicle, containing minimal excipients, safe for children's use and stable for 6 months.

The newly developed formulation was systematically assessed and its profile was compared to Resasis (R), 0.5% CyA extemporaneous preparation, and CyA-loaded poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PEO-b-PCL) a nongelling micelle formulation. In vivo Draize test showed that CyA-loaded PolyGel (TM) was well tolerated with only moderate irritation that resolved within 24 h. Both ex vivo corneal permeation and in vivo pharmacokinetics in aqueous humor (AqH) showed sustained release of CyA from PolyGel (TM). Non-compartmental analysis of CyA concentrations in AqH showed significant changes in pharmacokinetic parameters of CyA among different formulations. The highest C-max and AUC(0-infinity) in AqH were achieved with Restasis (R) followed by PolyGel (TM). Nonetheless, CyA-loaded PolyGel (TM) had approximately 87% longer t(1/2) for CyA compared to Resasis (R). Pharmacological and histopathological studies were performed on an endotoxin-induced uveitis rabbit model, where CyA-loaded PolyGel (TM) showed a comparable profile to Resasis (R). Our results point to a great potential of PolyGel (TM) as ocular drug delivery carrier.

AB The aim of this study was to prepare and characterize topical methotrexate (MTX) with different percentages (0.05%, 0.1%, 0.25% and 0.5%) entrapped in deformable liposomes using phosphatidylcholine and oleic acid. The effectiveness and sub-acute toxicity of these topical formulations were investigated in imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis in a mouse model (IMQP). The particle sizes of formulations were around 100 nm with a mean zeta potential of -72.87 mV. The entrapment efficiency (EE%) of MTX in liposomal formulations were more than 85%. Franz cell permeability studies indicated that permeation of MTX through the healthy BALB/c mice skin is very low; however, in the inflammatory skin, which was induced by IMQ it was significant (50%). Liposomal MTX (LM 0.05 and 0.1%) caused significant reduction of thickness score dose-dependently in IMQP compared to the injected MTX. Moreover, investigation of the inflammatory factor and pathological examinations of skin proved the superiority of the LM treating group. Pathological examinations also showed there are no toxicity in organs of the mice that received the LM. Blood cell count test didn't show any abnormality. MTX-entrapped deformable liposomes could be a topical option in future for the treatment of human psoriasis with a less toxicity and merit further investigations.

AB This work focuses on preparation of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) covered with cationic carbosilane dendrons and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). It is well known that AgNP and cationic carbosilane dendritic systems present antibacterial properties. On the other hand, PEG ligand provides antifouling properties and improved biocompatibility. Hence, combination of both ligands, carbosilane dendrons and PEG, on the AgNP surface can be a way to improve antibacterial capacity of AgNP. The new family of heterofunctionalized AgNP has been directly synthesized using silver precursor and cationic carbosilane dendrons and PEG ligands containing a thiol moiety. AgNP were characterized by TEM, TGA, UV, H-1 NMR, DLS, Z potential, XRD. The antibacterial capacity of these systems was evaluated against E. coli and S. aureus. The results confirmed the influence of both silver core and cationic carbosilane dendrons on the activity of these systems. The behaviour obtained for PEGylated systems were slightly lower than for non-PEGylated AgNP. However, hemolysis assays demonstrated that this decrease was compensated for by the greater biocompatibility. To more completely characterize the improvements of PEGylation on dendronized AgNP, one non-PEGylated and one PEGylated AgNP were tested for resistance in a planktonic state. Both AgNPs barely affected the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) whereas reference antibiotics generated significant resistance. In addition, relevant improvement in biofilm inhibition was achieved by dendronized AgNP after PEGylation.

AB With a dapivirine-releasing vaginal ring having successfully completed late-stage clinical testing for HIV prevention and currently undergoing regulatory review, there is now growing interest in next-generation multipurpose prevention technologies that seek to combine antiretroviral and contraceptive drugs within a single product. Here, we focus on ongoing efforts to develop a silicone elastomer vaginal ring releasing both dapivirine and levonorgestrel. Specifically, we evaluate various strategies aimed at both better understanding and reducing the tendency of levonorgestrel to bind with the elastomer, including: (i) formulation and post-manufacturing strategies aimed at reducing the extent of levonorgestrel reaction with addition-cure silicone elastomers; (ii) evaluation of a simple silicone system to model the complex elastomer; (iii) use of model compounds representing the enone and ethinyl moieties of levonorgestrel to probe the mode of addition of levonorgestrel to addition-cure silicone elastomers; and (iv) solution and solid-state C-13 NMR analysis to probe the structural features of the levonorgestrel-silicone system. The results demonstrate that both the enone and ethinyl groups within levonorgestrel undergo hydrosilylation reactions with the hydrosiloxane groups in the silicone elastomer leading to covalent binding. The results also highlight potential strategies for further optimising the dapivirine + levonorgestrel silicone vaginal ring formulation to ensure that the levonorgestrel is available for release.

AB The present study demonstrated the prediction of predominant root causes of capping behavior as a function of the powder rheological and the mechanical behavior of Acetaminophen (APAP) and Ibuprofen (IBU). The authors analyzed powder rheological properties for powder blend permeability, pressure drop, and cohesion. The measured deformation properties were compact porosity, internal air pressure, Brinell hardness, and tensile strength. The data were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively using multivariate techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and principal component regression (PCR) models, respectively, to identify the effect of powder air entrapment efficiency and mechanical behavior on the tablet capping score. The PCA model indicated that pressure drop, cohesion, API amount, and compression pressure correlated positively, whereas permeability, porosity, internal air pressure, Brinell hardness, and tensile strength correlated negatively to the capping potential. APAP and IBU also showed two independent mechanisms as a function of their amount on the capping score at all compression pressures. APAP and IBU followed an exponential and linear relationship, respectively. Furthermore, the dominant powder rheological and deformation behavior affecting the capping score of each material was identified and quantified using two separate PCR models. These models showed that APAP capping was predominantly dependent on its powder properties, while that of IBU was predominantly based on its deformation properties. In conclusion, APAP and IBU compacts capping had respective air induced and deformation induced capping behavior. The proposed approach can aid in understanding the underlying mechanisms of capping and developing an effective, optimized strategy to ensure tablet quality.

AB Control of infection and inflammation is crucial for the success of periodontal treatment. In this study, in-situ forming implants (ISFI) loaded with chlorhexidine dihydrochloride (CHX) and ibuprofen (IBU) were developed and tested to optimize periodontal treatment outcomes. Release profiles were promising. Exposure to 1.5% and 5.3% CHX-IBU loaded ISFI's release media decreased significantly the P. gingivalis growth up to 20-fold and 35-fold, respectively, after 48 h (p < 0.05). The metabolic activity assay of gingival epithelial cells (EC) demonstrated 1.5% CHX-IBU-loaded ISFI to be non-toxic, therefore, it was selected for further experimentation. Furthermore, significant down-regulation of TNF-a release (34% at 6h and 43% at 24 h, p < 0.05) in P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (Pg-LPS) stimulated EC exposed to 1.5% CHX-IBU ISFI release medium was demonstrated by ELISA. In vivo, 1.5% CHX-IBU ISFI was injected into the periodontal pocket in an experimental periodontitis mouse model and the reduction in inflammation and improvement in periodontal wound healing was evaluated through inflammatory cell scoring and histomorphometry at 7- and 15-days post-treatment. The results indicate that CHX-IBU loaded ISFI could be efficient as adjuvant to periodontal therapy for the control of infection and inflammation. Moreover, other (e.g., pro-regenerative) drugs could be incorporated into ISFI to further improve periodontal treatment outcomes.

AB Different dyes and a colored vitamin (riboflavin) were used to better understand the underlying drug release mechanisms in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based implants. The latter were prepared by hot melt extrusion (HME) or formed in-situ, upon solvent exchange when injecting a PLGA solution in N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP) into phosphate buffer pH 7.4. Methylene blue was used as water-soluble dye to stain the release medium, riboflavin as a yellow, water-soluble "model drug", and Sudan-III-red as poorly water-soluble dye, incorporated in the implant. In the case of pre-formed HME implants, the "orchestrating" role of polymer swelling for the control of drug release could be visualized: At early time points, only limited amounts of water penetrate into the system, insufficient for noteworthy drug dissolution and diffusion. However, bulk erosion starts, and once a critical polymer molecular weight threshold value is reached, substantial implant swelling sets on: Large amounts of water come in and allow for significant drug dissolution and diffusion. In the case of in-situ forming implants, the importance of the composition of the liquid formulation for the resulting inner implant structure could be visualized. The latter affects the rate and extent at which water penetrates into the system and, thus, the resulting drug release rate.

AB The association between superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION), carrying small interfering RNA (siRNA) as therapeutic agents and humanized anti- human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) single-chain antibody fragments (scFv) for the active delivery into HER2-overexpressing cells appears as an interesting approach for patients with HER2-overexpressing advanced breast cancer. The obtained Targeted Stealth Magnetic siRNA Nanovectors (TS-MSN) are formulated by combining: (i) the synthesis protocol of Targeted Stealth Fluorescent Particles (T-SFP) which form the core of TS-MSN and (ii) the formulation protocol allowing the loading of T-SFP with polyplexes (siRNA and cationic polymers). TS-MSN have suitable physico-chemical characteristics for intravenous administration and protect siRNA against enzymatic degradation up to 24 h. The presence of HER2-targeting scFv on TS-MSN allowed an improved internalization (3-4 times more compared to untargeted S-MSN) in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells (BT-474). Furthermore, anti-survivin siRNA delivered by TS-MSN in HER2-negative breast-cancer control cells (MDA-MB-231) allowed significant down-regulation of the targeted anti-apoptotic protein of about 70%. This protein down-regulation increased in HER2 + cells to about 90% (compared to 70% with S-MSN in both cell lines) indicating the contribution of the HER2-active targeting. In conclusion, TS-MSN are promising nanocarriers for the specific and efficient delivery of siRNA to HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells.

AB The stratum corneum is the main barrier to transdermal drug delivery which has previously resulted in mathematical modelling of solute transport in the skin being primarily directed at this skin layer. However, for topical treatment and skin toxicity studies, the concentration in the epidermis and dermis is important and needs to be modelled mathematically. Hitherto, mathematical models for viable skin layers typically simplified the clearance of solute by blood, either assuming sink condition at the top of the skin capillary loops or assuming a distributed clearance in the dermis. This paper is an attempt to develop a physiologically based mathematical model of drug transport in the viable skin. It incorporates explicit modelling of the capillary loops within the dermis and employs COMSOL Multiphysics (R) software to model the transport in three dimensions. Previously derived simplified models were compared to the results from this new numerical model. The results of this comparison showed that the simplified model reasonably described the average concentration in the viable skin layers when parameters of the models were chosen appropriately. When the recruitment of the capillary loops in the dermis was full and the top of capillary loops was at a depth of 100 mu m, the effective depth to place a sink condition in the simpler models was found to be at 150 mu m. However, when there was only partial recruitment of the capillaries, the effective depth increased to 180 mu m. The presented modelling is also essential for determining a transdermal flux when the stratum corneum barrier is compromised by such methods as microporation, application of chemical enhancers or microneedles.

AB Campylobacter jejuni is a leading cause of foodborne illness globally. In this study, a spray drying and packaging process was developed to produce a thermally-stable dry powder containing bacteriophages that retains biological activity against C. jejuni after long distance shipping at ambient temperature. Spray drying using a twin-fluid atomizer resulted in significantly less (p < 0.05) titer reduction than spray drying using a vibrating mesh nebulizer. The use of centrifugation and dilution of filtered bacteriophage lysate in the formulation step resulted in a significantly greater (p < 0.05) proportion of bacteriophages remaining active relative to use of no centrifugation and dilution. The spray-dried bacteriophage powder generated using leucine and trehalose as excipients was flowable, non-cohesive, and exhibited a high manufacturing yield. The powder retained its titer with no significant differences (p > 0.05) in biological activity after storage in suitable packaging for at least 3 weeks at room temperature and after ambient temperature shipping a total distance of approximately 19,800 km, including with a 38 degrees C temperature excursion. The bacteriophage powder therefore appears suitable for global distribution without the need for cold chain infrastructure.

AB The objectives of this work were to develop meloxicam based amorphous solid dispersion through electrospinning technique and evaluate the effect of the polymeric matrix on the physicochemical properties of the fibers and the downstream processing ability to orodispersible dosage forms. Drug - polymer interactions formed between Eudragit E and meloxicam, confirmed through Raman and 1HNMR spectra, enabled the development of fibers from ethanol, thus allowing an increased production rate compared to PVPk30 where a DMF:THF solvent system was suitable. Microflux dissolution-permeation studies showed a significantly higher diffusion from amorphous solid dispersions compared to crystalline meloxicam. The flux through the membrane was influenced by the polymers only under basic conditions, where the precipitation of Eudragit E limited the complete re-solubilization of the active ingredient. This phenomenon was not observed during large volume conventional dissolution testing. The effect of formulation on long term stability could not be highlighted as all products were stable up to 15 months, stored in closed holders at 25 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C and 50%RH +/- 10%. The increased surface area of fibers enabled tablet preparation with low pressures due to favorable bonding between particles during compression. PVPk30 formulation presented higher tabletability and compactability, as higher tensile strength compacts could be prepared. Eudragit E formulation had lower detachment and ejection stress, suggesting a lower sticking tendency during tableting. The presence of HP beta CD in PVPk30 formulation offered improved morphological features of the fibers, however no significant effect was observed on dissolution, permeation or mechanical properties.

AB Respiratory tract infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria are serious burdens to the public. Our previous findings indicated that co-loading of colistin and ciprofloxacin via liposomes improved in vitro antimicrobial activities against multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa as compared to the monotherapies. The current study aims to investigate the transport behavior of colistin and ciprofloxacin in liposomes using the in vitro Calu-3 cell monolayer, which is a lung epithelial model cultured under the air-interfaced condition. The cell viability results demonstrated that there was no obvious toxicity of cells exposed to single or co-administered drugs at the concentration <= 500 mu g/mL. Transport of ciprofloxacin into the cells was easier than that of colistin, which reached a plateau rapidly. Colistin was less trapped in the mucus or adhered to the apical cell membrane, and less transported across the cell monolayer than ciprofloxacin. The deposition of ciprofloxacin on the apical side increased over time (from 1 to 4 h). There was no drug-drug interaction observed during the transport of ciprofloxacin and colistin across the cell monolayer, when they were dosed together in the solution form. The amount of drug transported across the cell monolayer was decreased in both agents when loaded in liposomes. Both drugs were more trapped in the mucus or more adhered to the apical side cell membrane of the cell monolayer when they were in liposomes. This study demonstrated that co-delivery of colistin and ciprofloxacin in a single liposome can reduce transport capacity of both drugs across the lung epithelial cell monolayer and enhance drug retention on the lung epithelial surfaces; therefore, it is a promising approach to treat the respiratory infections caused by multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

AB Polymers are the backbone of pharmaceutical drug delivery. There are several polymers with varying properties available today for use in different pharmaceutical applications. Alginate is widely used in biomedical research due to its attractive features such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, inertness, low cost, and ease of production and formulation. Encapsulation of therapeutic agents in alginate/alginate complex microspheres protects them from environmental stresses, including the acidic environment in the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) and enzymatic degradation, and allows targeted and sustained delivery of the agents. Microencapsulation is playing an increasingly important role in drug delivery as evidenced by the recent surge in research articles on the use of alginate in the delivery of small molecules, cells, bacteria, proteins, vaccines, and for tissue engineering applications. Formulation of these alginate microspheres (AMS) are commonly achieved by conventional external gelation method using various instrumental manipulation such as vortexing, homogenization, ultrasonication or spray drying, and each method affects the overall particle characteristics. In this review, an inclusive summary of the currently available methods for the formulation of AMS, its recent use in the encapsulation and delivery of therapeutics, and future outlook will be discussed.

AB Carbon dots (CDs) are emerging nanomaterial in medicine and pharmacy. To explore the impact of physicochemical characteristics on their safety, we synthesized a library of 35 CDs exhibiting different size, charge, chemical composition and surface coating, using various starting materials (carbon source and passivation reagent) and carbonization procedures. The 35 CDs triggered different levels of viability loss when incubated with human macrophages at 3-200 mu g/mL for 24 h. The smaller NPs (10-20 nm) were more toxic that larger ones (40-100 nm), whereas NPs that aggregated in culture medium were more toxic than dispersed ones. A positive correlation was found between CD charge or nitrogen content and toxicity. Furthermore, a greater toxicity was observed for CDs prepared from high molecular weight polyamines, suggesting a role of the CD global density of positive charges, rather than the charge at the CD surface, in the CD toxicity. At last, PEG decoration decreased the toxicity of cationic NPs. In conclusion, the size, aggregation in culture medium, charge, nitrogen content, nature of the passivation agent and synthesis procedure were found to influence CD toxicity, making it difficult to predict CD safety from a single characteristic.

TI Quantitative evaluation of the thallium binding of soluble and insoluble

DE Prussian blue; Hexacyanoferrate; Thallium binding; Moisture content;

ID FERRIC HEXACYANOFERRATE; ADSORPTION; PIGMENTS
AB There has been a long-standing discussion in the scientific literature on the thallium (Tl) binding capacity of ferric hexacyanoferrate (insoluble) and potassium hexacyanoferrate (soluble) forms of Prussian blue (PB). The literature sometime suggests that the soluble form of PB should be used to treat thallium poisoning, instead of the FDA approved insoluble form of PB. The literature debate is further complicated by the lack of fundamental characterization data such as critical quality attributes (CQAs) that clearly define the analog forms. The purpose of this study is to compare, the binding capacity of soluble and insoluble PB analogs with the same CQAs (particle size/distribution and water content). Water content and particle size/particle distribution were determined by TGA, and solid-state laser diffraction particle sizing. Thallium binding studies were conducted at physiological pH to determine the maximal binding capacity (MBC) at equilibrium. Multiple linear regression and principal component analysis was also used for multivariate data analysis. Results indicate that insoluble and soluble analogs, with similar quality attributes, have nearly identical, MBC binding capacities of (441.5 mg/ g) for insoluble vs soluble (458.4 mg/g). However, when both analog forms with different CQAs such as water, particle size were compared, results indicated significantly higher or lower thallium binding levels. In conclusion, it is essential that the FDA approved iron form with well-defined CQAs is used to treat thallium poisoning and radioactive thallium metal contamination for consistent therapeutic outcomes.

AB Long-term stability of polyplexes used for biomedical purposes is an objective envisaged by any research group developing this kind of nanoformulations. However, since biodegradable polymers such as oligopeptide end-modified poly (beta-aminoester) (OM-PBAE) are frequently used to ensure safety, and formulations are produced as aqueous dispersions, the stability of the nanoformulations is usually compromised. In this context, freeze-drying has aroused as a promising storage alternative to obtain solid nanoformulations with enhanced stability over time. Lyophilization is a challenging step that usually produces aggregation. Although some studies already achieved freeze-dried PBAE nanoparticles, none of them detailed the parameters that are critical for the success of this process. Moreover, due to the specific composition of each formulation, the critical parameters for the correct freeze-drying process need to be adjusted for each polyplex developed. In this paper, we have studied the variables that have a direct influence on the manufacturing and lyophilization of OM-PBAE nanoparticles with the aim to develop a versatile and robust freeze-drying receipt that properly preserves the library of polyplexes designed in our group, which have different pKa depending on the modification applied.

AB The new frontier of medicine is the personalization of treatment to match a patient's individual needs. Fused-filament fabrication (FFF) offers a platform for the personalization of drug dosage forms, but one of its chief shortcomings compared to other tablet production methods such as dry compression and wet granulation is relatively low throughput. Conversely, injection molding (IM) is a manufacturing technique for the high-volume production of parts, but in which individual part customization is both expensive and slow requiring the modification of expensive mold tooling. Mass-customization is the manufacture of custom products that match the needs of individual consumers but which are produced at the low unit cost associated with high-volume production. We successfully integrated for the first time FFF with IM in a multi-step manufacturing process for the production of custom bilayer tablets loaded with two active pharmaceutical ingredients used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. The FFF layer was loaded with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, while the IM layer was loaded with lovastatin. Infill percentage was varied for the FFF layer as a means to modify drug release. The IM injection pressure was evaluated for its effect on drug release and layer-layer adhesion. The bilayer tablets obtained offered different combinations of drug release profiles, which were governed by a combination of factors, including surface area to volume ratio; IM injection volume penetration into the FFF layer; FFF infill percentage; layer tortuosity and porosity. These different parameters could be utilized to modify the individual release of both drugs from the bilayer tablet. Thus for the first time, we have demonstrated a viable method for the mass-customization of oral tablets which could hasten the rollout of personalized medicine.

AB Polymer-assisted cocrystallisation via hot melt extrusion (HME) facilitates the cocrystallisation process and increases cocrystal yield compared with the HME of neat cocrystal components. This makes it an attractive method for the single-step continuous synthesis of pharmaceutical cocrystals. The aim of this study is to understand the effect of semicrystalline (Poloxamer P407, PXM) or amorphous (Soluplus (R), SOL) polymers on the cocrystallisation of model theophylline-nicotinamide (TP:NA, 1:1) cocrystal with significantly different melting temperatures of API (TP, m.p. = 271.4 degrees C) and coformer (NA, m.p. = 128.7 degrees C) in neat and matrix-assisted cocrystallisation via HME. Compared with the processing of neat cocrystal components, the addition of PXM led to formulation of TP:NA cocrystal embedded in the polymer matrix and increased the cocrystal formation efficiency. On the other hand, the co-processing of cocrystal components with SOL resulted in the formation of cocrystal embedded in the amorphous polymer matrix or in the partially amorphous TP:NA/SOL composites. The one-step formulation of API:coformer mixtures with polymers using HME may result in phase changes or the formation of amorphous solid dispersions, which highlights the importance of matrix selection and phase control of the final product.

AB In this study, optimized cephalexin-loaded niosomal formulations based on span 60 and tween 60 were prepared as a promising drug carrier system. The niosomal formulations were characterized using a series of techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and zeta potential measurement. The size and drug encapsulation efficiency are determined by the type and composition of surfactant. The developed niosomal formulations showed great storage stability up to 30 days with low change in size and drug entrapment during the storage, making them potential candidates for real applications. Moreover, the prepared niosomes showed negligible cytotoxicity for HepG2 cells, measured by MTT assay. The antibacterial properties of cephalexin-loaded niosome were investigated using S. aureus and E. coll. as gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. The results showed that the encapsulation of antibiotic drug in niosomal formulation could enhance the antibacterial efficiency of the drug, where the minimum inhibitory concentration was droped from 8 mu g/mL (cephalexin) to 4 mu g/mL (cephalexin-loaded niosome) and from 4 mu g/mL (cephalexin) to 1 mu g/mL (cephalexin-loaded niosome) against E. coll. and S. aureus, respectively. The findings of our study show that the improvement of cephalexin bioavailability and prolonged drug release profile could be obtained by niosomal formulation as a favorable antibiotic drug delivery system.

AB Polymeric biomaterials and nanoparticles (NPs) have shown a potential to be widely used for medical purposes. Functional limits of their biocompatibility depend on cellular and molecular responses between host and their artificial surfaces. Accordingly, medical devices of polymer biomaterials like endovascular scents, cardiopulmonary bypass circuits, and prostheses, may trigger inflammation or can be rejected by host due to the induction of immune responses. Furthermore, the main restriction to the use of NPs for medical purposes is their short in vivo circulation time because of their rapid clearance via the reticuloendothelial system. Various methods are under investigation to produce bioinert biomaterials and NPs. Currently, PEGylation and camouflaging are the most common approaches to enhance their biocompatibility. However, the disadvantages and limitations of these methods are leading to research new strategies. The CD47 molecule is well known as a widely expressed cellular surface receptor activating the transudction of the "don't-eat-me" signal. This review elaborates on the role of CD47 in the immune system and the application of CD47 mimicry peptides to produce bioinert biomaterials and NPs.

AB The objective of this study was to prepare a supersaturated formulation based on formation of a co-amorphous system of a drug and a coformer in order to enhance skin permeation. Atenolol (ATE) and urea (URE) were used as the model drug and the coformer, respectively. Thermal analysis of physical mixtures of ATE and URE showed decreases in the melting points and the formation of a co-amorphous system which was in a supercooled liquid state because of a low glass transition temperature. Supersaturated solutions of ATE and URE at different molar ratios in polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG400) were prepared. The precipitations were observed under storage at 25 degrees C for all formulations except for ATE-URE at 1:8 molar ratio which remained in the supersaturated state for 2 months. H-1 NMR analysis confirmed the interactions between ATE and URE in PEG400. The ATE-URE supersaturated formulation showed higher permeability for mice skin than that of ATE saturated formulation, which was superior to the expected permeability from the degree of supersaturation. We concluded that coamorphous based supersaturated formulation offers much promise for transdermal drug delivery.

AB The main objective of this study was to develop a novel self-assembled micelle system to improve the oral bioavailability of the water-insoluble and thermal instable germacrone (GEM). Micelles were prepared with an improved supercritical reverse phase evaporation (ISCRPE) method, and the thin-film hydration (TFH) method was used for comparison. Physicochemical characterization confirmed the nanospherical morphology of the micelles prepared by the ISCRPE method (GEM@SDL-SCF Micelles) had smaller particle size and greater encapsulation efficiency than that of the micelles prepared by the TFH method (GEM@SDL-THF Micelles). Dilution resistance and stability experiments were performed to assess the structural integrity. In vitro GEM release was analyzed by the dialysis diffusion method, and the micelle system showed sustained and cumulative release. Furthermore, the fluorescence results from the cellular uptake study revealed improved drug absorption of GEM since the green fluorescence intensity of C6@SDL-SCF Micelles were stronger than that of C6@SDL-TFH Micelles. The transcellular transport study showed a distinct increase in the apparent permeability coefficient (AP -> BL) in a Caco-2 cell transport model, and free GEM solution, GEM@SDL-TFH Micelles and GEM@SDL-SCF Micelles had permeability coefficients of 7.30 x 10(-6), 8.01 x 10(-6), and 10.57 x 10(-6) cm.s(-1), respectively. The pharmacokinetics study in Sprague-Dawley rats showed that the oral absorption capacity of the GEM@SDL-SCF Micelles was obviously enhanced, with a relative oral bioavailability of 298% and 147% compared with that of free GEM solution and GEM@SDL-TFH Micelles, respectively. The gastrointestinal safety assessment demonstrated that the micelles used in the experiment did not cause gastrointestinal toxicity. These results indicated that self-assembled micelles are promising nanocarriers aimed at enhancing the oral absorption of drugs with thermal sensitivity and low aqueous solubility, and micelles prepared by supercritical fluid (SCF) technology showed better performance than those prepared by the TFH method.

AB Trial-and-error approach to formulation development is long and costly. With growing time and cost pressures in the pharmaceutical industry, the need for computer-based formulation design is greater than ever. In this project, emulgels were designed and optimized using Formulating for Efficacy (TM) (FFE) for the topical delivery of ibuprofen. FFE helped select penetration enhancers, design and optimize emulgels and simulate skin penetration studies. pH, viscosity, spreadability, droplet size and stability of emulgels were evaluated. Franz cell studies were performed to test in vitro drug release on regenerated cellulose membrane, drug permeation in vitro on Strat-M (R) membrane and ex vivo on porcine ear skin, a marketed ibuprofen gel served as control. Emulgels had skin compatible pH, viscosity and spreadability comparable to a marketed emulgel, were opaque and stable at 25 degrees C for 6 months. Oleyl alcohol (OA), combined with either dimethyl isosorbide (DMI) or diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (DGME) provided the highest permeation in 24 h in vitro, which was significantly higher than the marketed product (p < 0.01). OA + DGME significantly outperformed OA ex vivo (p < 0.05). The computer predictions, in vitro and ex vivo penetration results correlated well. FFE was a fast, valuable and reliable tool for aiding in topical product design for ibuprofen.

AB In freeze-dried protein formulations, the composition governs the physical forms of the excipients and hence their functionality. It is also necessary to understand the effect of composition on the molecular relaxation behavior, a key factor influencing protein stability. Mannitol (bulking agent) - trehalose (lyoprotectant) - bovine serum albumin (BSA) lyophiles with varying trehalose to BSA mass ratios were investigated. The crystalline phases were characterized by X-ray diffractometry. The secondary structure of albumin in lyophiles and reconstituted solutions was evaluated by IR spectroscopy and circular dichroism, respectively. Dielectric spectroscopy was used to obtain the relaxation time of freeze-dried samples. When trehalose to BSA ratio was 0.2, while mannitol crystallized predominantly as the delta-anhydrous polymorph, trehalose remained amorphous. At lower concentrations of BSA, mannitol crystallized in both hemihydrate and anhydrous forms, and trehalose as dihydrate. The extent of dehydration during subsequent drying was dictated by the trehalose to BSA ratio in the formulation. A gradual increase in the Johari-Goldstein relaxation time was observed as the concentration of trehalose increased in the formulation. BSA was more susceptible to stresses from thawing than drying.

AB Arthritis is a chronic degenerative joint disease decreasing the patient's quality of life. Mixed micellar system (MM) was exploited as a nanotechnology platform suitable for the encapsulation of the water-insoluble drug, Resveratrol (RES). MM were prepared using different ratios of poloxamer 188 (P188) and poloxamer 407 (P407), and then subjected to in-vitro evaluation. The selected MM (MM3) composed of P188: P407 in a ratio of 2:1 attained the most compromised properties (Particle size = 52.97 +/- 4.52 nm, Encapsulation Efficiency = 76.20 +/- 4.51 and Release efficiency = 76.26 +/- 6.25), and was coated with poly-lactic acid (PLA). TEM photographs of PLA-coated MM3 showed a polymeric layer surrounding the nanoparticles. Rats with induced arthritis were used to study the curative effect of intra-articularly (IA)-injected MM3, PLA-coated MM3 as well as the drug suspension. All the treated groups showed a significant therapeutic improvement in arthritis proved by measuring rats knee diameter as well as the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). The treatment effectiveness was in the following order: PLA-coated MM3> MM3> drug suspension, (p < 0.05). Histological study showed the recovery of the joints and synovial structure by IA administration of the drug-loaded micellar nanosystems, and the PLA-coated MM attained the best effect. This study proves the promising curative effect of the designed nanotechnology-based drug carrier.

AB Chitosan (CS), due to its inherent mucoadhesive property and biofilm penetration ability, can be considered as very potent vehicle for local drug delivery to the lungs. This study reports on the preparation and in vitro antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity determination of ciprofloxacin loaded chitosan (Cipro-CS) microparticles with size in the range of 0.1-1 mu m, which may provide advantages of lower nanotoxicity and lower local clearance. Cipro-CS microparticles were prepared by ionic gelation method and their size, zeta potential and drug release pattern determined. The antibacterial activities of CS and Cipro-CS microparticles against pneumonia causing agents, namely Escherichia coil, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, were evaluated by determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The biocompatibility of the microparticles was tested in the human lung epithelial cell (BEAS-2B) culture, and microparticle association with the bacteria and epithelial cells was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy. Only the Cipro-CS microparticles, but not the CS microparticles, inhibited bacterial growth at concentrations not significantly cytotoxic to BEAS-2B cells. The Cipro-CS microparticles were able to damage the cell wall and membrane of the bacteria, and the ones <= 200 nm in size were internalized by both the BEAS-2B cells and the microorganisms.

AB In this work, we implemented a supramolecular approach in order to combine photodynamic therapy (PDT) with gene therapy. We made use of a simple cationic guanidylated porphyrin (H-2-PG) with the hypothesis that porphyrin aggregates should be capable of complexing siRNA through multivalent interactions and thus contribute to its intracellular delivery, while remaining active photosensitizers for PDT. The PDT effect of H-2-PG was shown by incubating human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) with H-2-PG followed by light-irradiation at 405 nm. On the other hand, while siRNA do not enter cells alone, we showed, by fluorescence confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, that H-2-PG promotes the internalization of Atto-488 siRNA. Finally, studying the combined PDT and delivery of siRNA directed against inhibitory apoptotic protein (IAP) family, we found an additive effect of the two therapies, thereby demonstrating that H-2-PG is capable of acing both as a photosensitizer and supramolecular siRNA vector.

AB This work demonstrates that an HSV-2 candidate vaccine can be thermostabilized by spray drying to reduce cold chain demands. This work is also to optimize the process responses by varying spray dry parameters for prescreened suitable excipients; and to determine the validity of current prescreening techniques. Vaccine activity losses were measured by in vitro plaque forming assay with Vero cell line. An accelerated storage condition of 45 degrees C for 10 days was used to determine spray dried sample stability. Prescreening studies demonstrated that trehalose and sucrose were superior to other tested excipients spray dry thermal stabilization of HSV-2. Subsequent optimization by design of experiments (DOE) of activity responses to spray dry parameter changes demonstrated significant differences between trehalose and sucrose for stability of the viral vaccine. Model parameters included the drying conditions inlet temperature, spray gas flow rate, and solids concentration for the model responses of vaccine stabilization. Trehalose was an effective and robust stabilizing excipient for spray drying HSV-2 vaccine. In contrast, stabilization by sucrose was greatly dependent on the spray dry process parameters. These DOE differences indicated inadequate excipient selection by prescreening methods and the variability demonstrated current prescreening techniques may not be adequate for determining optimal excipients.

ID IN-VITRO; DELIVERY; THERAPEUTICS; NANOPARTICLES; MICELLES; DRUGS
AB Bioactive peptides are attractive candidates for drug development. QAW is a tripeptide that is obtained from an anti-inflammatory protein-Annexin A1(ANXA1). Previous studies showed that QAW alleviated inflammation in experimental colitis and inflammatory bowel disease via NF-kappa B inhibition. This study establishes adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) mouse models and explores the anti-inflammatory efficacy of QAW in AIA mice. To enhance the targeting, responsiveness, and efficacy of QAW to inflammation, QAW (Q) is modified with a cell penetrating peptide (T), a matrix metalloproteases-2/9 (MMP-2/9) digestive peptide (M), and an inflammation targeting peptide-RGD (R). The designed RMTQ demonstrates enhanced delivery to cytoplasm, higher reduction of pro-inflammatory factors, and better efficacy than QAW. The anti-inflammatory efficacy of RMTQ is similar to that of DEX in this study whereas RMTQ treatment shows a higher safety than that of DEX. In sum, this study demonstrates that RMTQ can be a potential therapeutic for inflammatory arthritis.

AB This study aimed to develop biocompatible deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as carriers for improving the nasal delivery of insulin. The DES was prepared from malic acid and choline chloride broadly used in foods, drugs, or cosmetics as biocompatible additives. The DES of choline chloride and malic acid (CM-DES) demonstrated lower melting point (- 59.1 degrees C) and higher viscosity (120,000 cP) compared with hydrogels based on sodium carboxyl methyl cellulose (CMC-Na). The conformational structure of insulin does not change in CM-DES as characterized by circular dichroism. The in vitro results showed that CM-DES dissociated gradually but did not disintegrate immediately upon contact with water. CM-DES was able to improve the hypoglycemic effect of insulin significantly at different doses compared with hydrogels or solutions of insulin, which could be ascribed to facilitated penetration of insulin across the nasal epithelia by CM-DES. The hypoglycemic effect of CM-DES loading insulin at a dose of 25 IU/kg was similar to that of subcutaneous insulin at 1 IU/kg. In addition, no evident toxicity to nasal epithelia was observed after nasal administration to rats for seven consecutive days. In conclusion, CM-DES showed promising potential in enhancing the hypoglycemic effect of insulin via the nasal route.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of stabilizer type and concentration on the properties of spray dried nanosuspension-in-microparticles (NS-in-MPs) for inhalation. Taking resveratrol (RES) as a Biopharmaceutical Classification System II (BCS II) model drug, the RES containing nanosuspensions were fabricated by high pressure homogenization method with different stabilizers including sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), sodium alginate (SA), chitosan (CS) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Then, the nanosuspensions were spray dried with mannitol to obtain inhalable NS-in-MPs. The particle size, morphology, drug existing state, in vitro aerodynamic performance, in vitro release behavior, lung retention and pharmacokinetic behaviors were characterized. It was found that the morphology, lung deposition as well as in vitro drug release from the microparticles were significantly influenced by stabilizer type, with 1% PVA as stabilizer presenting the highest fine particle fraction (FPF). Meanwhile, taking PVA as an example, it was found stabilizer concentration could alter morphology and flowability of the microparticles, and the FPF value decreased with the increase of stabilizer concentration. Further drug retention and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the positively charged stabilizer CS could facilitate drug retention and minimize drug expose to the systemic circulation. In conclusion, the deposition and lung retention behavior of NS-in-MPs could be well tuned by selecting different type or concentration of stabilizers, which could facilitate local lung diseases therapy.

AB Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been used in treatment of osteoarthritis but their efficacy is marginal. One major reason is because of limited drug direct penetration to affected joint and muscle tissues from the topical application. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate a new topical treatment through enhancing the direct drug penetration to local muscle and joint tissues for improving topical treatment of osteoarthritis. A cationic prodrug, ketoprofen choline chloride (KCC) was synthesized for iontophoretic topical delivery. Anodal iontophoretic delivery of KCC and cathodal iontophoretic delivery of ketoprofen to the knee of live hairless rats were evaluated and the drug concentrations in the joint and muscle tissues over the time were determined. In addition, a knee osteoarthritis rat model was induced with intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate solution. Anodal iontophoretic delivery of KCC, cathodal iontophoretic delivery of ketoprofen, or anodal iontophoretic delivery of sodium chloride were applied to the affected knee joint of each rat group, respectively. Knee joint pain was evaluated through a hind paw weight bearing study and knee joint inflammation was evaluated through measuring of the knee diameter. Iontophoretic delivery of KCC showed much higher drug concentration in the knee joint and muscle tissues, compared to iontophoretic delivery of ketoprofen. Treatment of rat knee joint with anodal iontophoresis of KCC also showed significant pain relief and knee inflammation reduction comparing to the control group, while treatment results from cathodal iontophoresis of ketoprofen were mostly not significantly different from the control group.

AB Polymer microcapsules offer a possibility of storing increased amounts of drugs. Appropriate design and composition of the microcapsules allow tuning of the drug-release process. In this paper, we report on synthesis of hydrogel microcapsules sensitive to temperature and pH and degradable by glutathione and hydrogen peroxide. Microcapsules were based on thermo-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and degradable cystine crosslinker, and were synthesized by applying precipitation polymerization. Such way of polymerization was appropriately modified to limit the cross-linking in the microcapsule center. This led to a possibility of washing out the pNIPA core at room temperature and the formation of a capsule. Microcapsules revealed rather high drug-loading capacity of ca. 17%. The degradation of the microcapsules by the reducing agent (GSH) and the oxidizing agent (H2O2) was confirmed by using the DLS, UV-Vis, SEM and TEM techniques. Depending on pH and concentration of the reducing/oxidizing agents a fast or slow degradation of the microcapsules and a burst or long-term release of doxorubicin (DOX) were observed. The DOX loaded microcapsules appeared to be cytotoxic against A2780 cancer cells similarly to DOX alone, while unloaded microcapsules did not inhibit proliferation of the cells.

AB Novel emulsions with a nanostructured continuous phase have been proposed as controlled drug delivery systems to enhance topical delivery of active ingredients avoiding systemic effects. In this study, oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions with two surfactant/water (S/W) weight ratios of 40:60 and 35:65, and oil concentrations of 10 wt% (diluted emulsion), 40 wt% (concentrated emulsion) and 85 wt% (highly concentrated emulsion) have been investigated to identify the presence of liquid crystalline structures and their influence on drug release and skin permeation. The emulsions have been characterized in terms of visual appearance, rheology and drug release. The presence of cubic liquid crystalline structures in emulsions with S/W 40:60 was confirmed by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Rheology results showed a markedly different behaviour in emulsions with S/W 40:60 compared with nonstructured emulsions. A model drug, diclofenac sodium (DS) was successfully incorporated in the emulsions. DS release was studied with hydrophilic and lipophilic membranes, and the amount of DS in the receptor solution was significantly lower in the formulations containing cubic liquid structures. An in vitro skin permeation study with dermatomed human skin showed that emulsions with a nanostructured continuous phase are suitable formulations for topical delivery with DS retention in skin layers. The results indicate that the amount of drug retained in skin structures may be tuned by modification of liquid crystal concentration and emulsion structure.

AB A promising strategy for treatment of EGFR-dependent tumours is EGFR signal transduction suppression via inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase using high doses of statins, popular cholesterol-lowering drugs.
   The main purpose of this study was to obtain targeted long circulating immunoliposomes containing simvastatin (tLCLS) with anti-EGFR antibody attached to their surface and to test whether they can be effective in treatment of TNBC. The designed tLCLS were characterized in terms of physicochemical properties and longterm stability. In vitro experiments conducted on MDA-MB-231 cells demonstrated that tLCLS induced apoptosis and are characterized by IC50 of 7.5 mu M. Treatment of studied cells with tLCLS led to a decrease in membrane order and inhibited PI3K/Akt signalling. Analyses of efficacy of the tLCLS in in vivo experiments in model animals indicate that immunoliposomes were effectively delivered to tumours. Our results showed that regardless of whether tLCLS were administered before or after tumour formation, at the tested dose they inhibited tumour growth by an average of 25% in comparison to the control. However, the results were not statistically significant.
   The experiments described above allowed us to test the possibility of using immunoliposomes as simvastatin carriers delivering increased amounts of the drug to tumour cells.

AB The treatment and management of COPD by inhalation to the lungs has emerged as an attractive alternative route to oral dosing due to higher concentrations of the drug being administered to site of action. In this study, Nanocomposite Microparticles (NCMPs) of microRNA (miR-146a) containing PGA-co-PDL nanoparticles (NPs) for dry powder inhalation were formulated using c-leucine and mannitol. The spray-drying (Buchi B290) process was optimised and used to incorporate NPs into NCMPs using mix of c-leucine and mannitol excipients in different ratios (F1; 100:0% w/w, F2; 75:25% w/w, F3; 50:50% w/w, F4; 25:75% w/w, F5; 0:100% w/w) to investigate yield %, moisture content, aerosolisation performance and miR-146a biological activity. The optimum condition was performed at feed rate 0.5 ml/min, aspirator rate 28 m(3)/h, atomizing air flow rate 480 L/h, and inlet drying temperature 70 degrees C which produced highest yield percentage and closest recovered NPs size to original prior spray-drying. The optimum formulation (F4) had a high yield (86.0 +/- 15.01%), recovered NPs size after spray-drying 409.7 +/- 10.05 nm (initial NPs size 244.8 +/- 4.40 nm) and low moisture content (2.02 +/- 0.03%). The aerosolisation performance showed high Fine Particle Fraction (FPF) 51.33 +/- 2.9%, Emitted Dose (ED) of 81.81 +/- 3.0%, and the mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) was <= 5 mu m suggesting a deposition in the respirable region of the lungs. The biological activity of miR-146a was preserved after spray-drying process and miR-146a loaded NCMPs produced target genes IRAK1 and TRAF6 silencing. These results indicate the optimal process parameters for the preparation of NCMPs of miR-146a-containing PGA-coPDL NPs suitable for inhalation in the treatment and management of COPD.

AB The purpose of this work was to investigate the feasibility to manufacture enteric capsules, which could be used in compounding pharmacies, by fused-deposition modeling. It is well-known that conventional enteric dip coating of capsules in community pharmacies or hospitals is a time-consuming process which is characterized by an erratic efficacy. Fused-deposition modeling was selected as a potential 3D printing method due its ease and low-cost implementation. Before starting to print the capsules, an effective sealing system was designed via a computer-aided design program. Hot melt extrusion was used to make printable enteric filaments. They were made of the enteric polymer, a plasticizer and a thermoplastic polymer, namely Eudragit (R) L100-55, polyethylene glycol 400 and polylactic acid, respectively. Riboflavine-5'-phosphate was selected as a coloured drug model to compare the efficacy of the 3D printed capsules to that of enteric dip coated capsules as they are currently produced in community pharmacies and hospitals. Different parameters of fabrication which could influence the dissolution profile of the model drug, such as the layer thickness or post-processing step, were studied. It was demonstrated that our 3D printed enteric capsules did not release the drug for 2 h in acid medium (pH 1.2). However, they completely dissolved within 45 min at pH 6.8 which allowed the release of a minimal amount of 85% w/w of drug as it was recommended by the European Pharmacopoeia 9th Edition for enteric products.

AB Loperamide, an over the counter anti-diarrheal drug, also infamously referred to as "poor man's methadone". Due to the ease of availability and low price, people/patients abuse it by consuming more than 30 tablets to achieve euphoric effect and to combat opioid withdrawal. But supratherapeutic doses of loperamide result in severe respiratory depression, cardiac dysrhythmia and mortality. To address this issue, we developed a unique and innovative technology to deter multi-dose oral abuse. The concept is to design a tablet which can immediate release loperamide in diarrheic patients (single tablet) while stops loperamide release in case of intentional multi-dose ingestion. Loperamide was molecularly dispersed into gastric soluble cationic polymers - Eudragit (R) EPO and Kollicoat (R) Smartseal 100P using hot melt extrusion to obtain filament. Filaments were milled and compressed into tablets ((Eudragit (R) EPO (SJU1) and Kollicoat (R) Smartseal (SJU2)) with optimized amount of L-Arginine. Dissolution in 250 mL of Fasted state simulated gastric fluid (FaSSGF) revealed that single tablet of Imodium (R) (marketed formulation) and SJU1 showed > 85% of release within 15 min. Most importantly, in multi-unit dissolution (15 tablets), Imodium (R) exhibited > 90% release but SJU tablets showed < 2% of drug release thus demonstrating its ability to deter multi-dose oral abuse.

AB Nanoparticles are being developed for a wide range of medical applications such as, controlled release, drug delivery systems or imagery, theranostics, implants .... For the moment, there is no legal definition of nanoparticles or nanomaterials for therapeutic use. The specific case of gold nanoparticles is not an exception: their current definition as nanoparticle material does not correspond to classic pharmaceutical ingredients as described in Pharmacopoeias. In this study, more than 30 different batches of citrate stabilized gold nanoparticles (AuNP) were synthesized and analyzed thanks to both classical approaches (UV-Vis spectrophotometry, dynamic light scattering coupled or not to electrophoresis ...) and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) coupled to diode array detection to assess their purity and impurity profiles. These techniques led to the beginning of defined specifications, a key step for the use of gold nanoparticles as pharmaceutical ingredients. CZE was demonstrated suitable to evaluate a batch-to-batch quality control, to monitor the purification processes and to follow the stability of 18 different batches for 20 days. Finally, commercially available AuNP samples were tested and the results compared to the provided certificates of analysis.

AB Epidemiological studies have compellingly documented the ability of the Mediterranean diet rich in extra-virgin olive oil to reduce the incidence of certain malignancies, and cardiovascular diseases, and slow the Alzheimer's disease progression. S-(-)-Oleocanthal (OC) was identified as the most bioactive olive oil phenolic with documented anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and anti-Alzheimer's activities. OC consumption causes irritating sensation at the oropharynx via activation of TRPA1. Accordingly, a taste-masked formulation of OC is needed for its future use as a nutraceutical while maintaining its bioactivity and unique chemistry. Therefore, the goal of this study was to prepare a taste-masked OC solid formulation with improved dissolution and pharmacodynamic profiles, by using (+)-xylitol as an inert carrier. Xylitol was hypothesized to serve as an ideal vehicle for the preparation of OC solid dispersions due to its low melting point and sweetness. The optimized OC-(+)-xylitol solid dispersion was physically and chemically characterized and showed effective taste masking and enhanced dissolution properties. Furthermore, OC-(+)-xylitol solid dispersion maintained potent in vivo anti-breast cancer activity. It effectively suppressed the human triple negative breast cancer development, growth, and recurrence after primary tumor surgical excision in nude mice orthotopic xenograft models. Collectively, these results suggest the OC-(+)-xylitol solid dispersion formulation as a potential nutraceutical for effective control and prevention of human triple negative breast cancer.

AB In the global context of an imminent emergence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms, the present work combined the use of nanotechnology and the therapeutic benefits of natural compounds as a strategy to potentiate antimicrobial action of the wide-spectrum antibiotic Ofloxacin (Ofx). Hybrid solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) were synthesized by incorporation of chitosan (Chi, a cationic biopolymer with antimicrobial activity) and eugenol (Eu, a phenolic compound that interferes with bacterial quorum sensing) into a lipid matrix by hot homogenization/ultrasonication method. The developed SLN/Chi/Eu sustainably released the encapsulated Ofx for 24 h. Characterization by DLS, TEM, DSC, TGA and XRD revealed the presence of positively charged spherical nanoparticles with diameters around 300 nm and Ofx entrapped in amorphous state. The SLN exhibited an enhanced bactericidal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for free and nanoencapsulated Ofx formulations was below 1.0 mu g/ml. The MIC values decreased by 6.1- to 16.1-fold when Ofx was encapsulated in SLN/Chi/Eu. Fluorescent-labeled nanoparticles had the ability to interact with the bacterial cell membrane. Selective toxicity of SLN/Chi/Eu-Ofx was tested in the range of 0.3-30.0 mu g/ml and showed no toxicity up to 3.0 mu g/ml Ofx in human cell models (A549 and Wi-38) at 24 h and 48 h exposure. It was proved that the administration of hybrid SLN to mice by dry powder inhalation reached therapeutic Ofx levels in lungs.

AB Lipid-based nanoparticles, a potential nonviral vector due to their good biocompatibility and biodegradability, have been extensively developed for the delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA). We designed a unique pH-responsive lipid derivative, a dioleylphosphate-diethylenetriamine conjugate (DOP-DETA). DOP-DETA consists of a pH-responsive triamine and unsaturated fatty acids that accelerate membrane fusion. Our results showed that DOP-DETA-based liposomes (DL) efficiently delivered siRNA into the cytoplasm and induced RNA interference even at a low siRNA concentration. The knockdown efficiency of DL depended on the molar ratio of total DL lipids to siRNA. When siRNA was formulated with a sufficient amount of DL, it was efficiently taken up by cells and induced effective gene silencing. Time-lapse imaging showed that siRNA transfected with DL was rapidly internalized into the cells and uniformly dispersed in the cytoplasm within a few minites. The results also showed that DL induced sufficient change in surface charge to allow it to interact with the cell membrane and to allow for rapid endosomal escape. Uptake pathway and time-lapse imaging studies revealed that siRNA was delivered by DL into the cytoplasm, possibly through both macropinocytosis and membrane fusion. The present results emphasize that the modulation of surface charge on nanoparticles is crucial for each siRNA delivery process. Our results also suggest that DL is a potentially useful vector for inducing gene silencing with low-doses of siRNA.

AB Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) and nanoemulsions (NE) are colloid carriers which could improve dermal delivery of tacrolimus. The aims of this study were to evaluate effects of different formulation and process parameters on physicochemical characteristics and stability of lecithin-based NLC with glyceryl palmitostearate as solid and propylene glycol monocaprylate as liquid lipid and to compare the influence of different inner structure of tacrolimus-loaded NLC and corresponding NE on physicochemical characteristics, stability, entrapment efficiency, in vitro drug release and overall skin performance. Solid/liquid lipid ratio, total amount of lipids, homogenization pressure and cooling after the preparation were identified as critical variables in NLC development. Moreover, tacrolimus-loaded NLC emerged as more stabile carrier than NE. Differential stripping performed on porcine ear skin revealed significantly higher tacrolimus amount in stratum corneum from nanocarriers compared to referent ointment (Protopic (R)). Similarly the highest amount of tacrolimus in hair follicles was obtained using NLC (268.54 +/- 92.38 ng/cm(2)), followed by NE (128.17 +/- 48.87 ng/cm(2)) and Protopic (R) (77.61 +/- 43.25 ng/cm(2)). Contrary, the highest permeation rate through full-thickness porcine ear skin was observed for Proopic (R), implying that the selection of experimental setup is critical for reliable skin performance assessment. Overall, developed NLC could be suggested as promising carrier in a form of lotion for tacrolimus dermal delivery.

AB With respect to all biopharmaceuticals marketed to date, monoclonal antibodies represent the largest fraction with more than 48% market share (2012). However, the development of biopharmaceutical formulations is a challenging task, and time-consuming and cost-intensive high-throughput screenings are still state-of-the-art in formulation design. These screening techniques are almost exclusively based on heuristic decisions thus the benefit in terms of mechanistic understanding is often unclear. It requires novel, physical-sound methods to enhance/optimize future formulation development, ideally by understanding molecular interactions in these complex solutions. A suitable and evaluated measure-of-choice to characterize protein-protein interactions in aqueous protein solutions is the second osmotic virial coefficient B-22 which can be measured using static light scattering techniques. Furthermore B-22 can be modeled/predicted via the extended mxDLVO model for protein-protein interactions in the presence of single excipients and excipient-mixtures. Building up on this approach, giving an additional insight into water-water and water-excipient interactions, the thermodynamic equation-of-state ePC-SAFT is used to calculate water activity coefficients in the presence of excipient-mixtures. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) was chosen as a model protein to predict B-22-values for IgG in the presence of model excipient-mixtures (trehalose-NaCl, L-histidine-trehalose, L-histidine-NaCl). The combination of water activity coefficients and B-22 allows to quickly identify a first guess on suitable formulation conditions that then can be further evaluated with existing methods/knowledge.

AB Transdermal delivery represents a very attractive administration route that provides various advantages over other methods of administration, including enhanced patient compliance via non-invasive, painless and simple application and reduced side effects. Thereby, the research on suitable drugs for this route continues to increase. However, most of drug candidates face the challenges of low drug permeability across the skin's biologically active barrier - the stratum corneum (SC). In this context, a low cost, simple screening tool to evaluate penetration of drug candidates in a human SC barrier model was developed. The in vitro model is based on a modified phospholipid vesicle-based permeation assay (PVPA) with a lipid composition close to human SC layer. The new SC PVPA model can be stored up to 2 weeks at - 20 degrees C, withstand a pH range from 2.0 to 8.0 and the presence of co-solvents (DMSO, oleic acid and cremophor (R)) without losing their integrity. The human mimicking SC PVPA model was able to detect calcein permeability differences when different drugs, applied in the therapy of skin-related diseases, were present. The obtained data correlated well with the well accepted pig ear model, which highlights the potential of this new human SC model.

AB Nasal vaccination is considered to be an effective and convenient way of increasing immune responses both systemically and locally. Although various nanovaccine carriers have been introduced as potential immune adjuvants, further improvements are still needed before they can be taken to clinical usage. Chitosan-based nanovaccine carriers are one of the most widely studied adjuvants, owing to the ability of chitosan to open tight junctions between nasal epithelial cells and enhance particle uptake as well as its inherent immune activating role. In present study, bovine serum albumin (BSA) loaded nanoparticles were prepared using novel aminated (aChi) and aminated plus thiolated chitosan (atChi) polymers, to further enhance mucoadhesiveness and adjuvanticity of the vaccine system by improving electrostatic interactions of polymers with negatively charged glycoproteins. Nanocarriers with optimum size and surface charge, high encapsulation efficiency of model antigen and good stability were developed. Negligible toxicity was observed in Calu-3 and A549 cell lines. In vivo studies, revealed high levels of systemic antibodies (IgG, IgG(1) and IgG(2a)) throughout the study and presence of sIgA in vaginal washes showed that common mucosal system was successfully stimulated. Cytokine levels indicated a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response. A shift towards cellular immune responses was observed after nasal immunisation with antigen loaded nanoparticle formulations. These nanoparticles exhibit great potential for nasal application of vaccines.

AB Synthetic polymers, especially those with biocompatible and biodegradable characteristics, may offer effective alternatives for the treatment of severe wounds and burn injuries. Ideally, the scaffold material should induce as little pain as possible, enable quick healing, and direct the growth of defect-free epidermal cells. The best material with this multifunctionality, such as self-healing dressings, should be hydrophilic and have uninterrupted and direct contact with the damaged tissue. In addition, the ideal biomaterial should have some antibacterial properties. In this study, a novel technique was used to fabricate composite electrospun wound-dressing nanofibers composed of polyurethane encasing lavender oil and silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs). After electro-spinning, the fabricated nanofibers were identified using various techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). An abundance of Ag NPs in the fibers decreased the diameter of the fibers while increased concentration of the lavender oil increased the diameter. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies showed the presence of the lavender oil and Ag NPs in the fiber dressings. The Ag NPs and lavender oil improved the hydrophilicity of the nanofibers and ensured the proliferation of chicken embryo fibroblasts cultured in-vitro on these fiber dressings. The antibacterial efficiency of the nanofiber dressings was investigated using E. coli. and S. aureus, which yielded zones of inhibition of 16.2 +/- 0.8 and 5.9 +/- 0.5 mm, respectively, indicating excellent bactericidal properties of the dressings. The composite nanofiber dressings have great potential to be used as multifunctional wound dressings; offering protection against external agents as well as promoting the regeneration of new tissue.

ID CONTINUOUS DIRECT COMPRESSION; TWIN-SCREW GRANULATION; PLATFORM;
   POWDERS; FEEDER; BATCH
AB Many studies on continuous twin-screw granulation only focus on the granulator without linking this process step to the upstream and downstream unit operations. Product critical quality attributes (CQAs) are however not only determined by the granulation step. In this study, the possibility to manage the batch-to-batch variability of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in a high drug loaded formulation on a continuous line was investigated to obtain consistent tablet CQAs. As the ultimate goal of continuous manufacturing is to produce 24/7, current study also aimed at guaranteeing long term stability of the process. To do so, previously identified API critical material attributes (CMAs) were varied together with granulation, drying and milling critical process parameters (CPPs) in a screening design of experiments to understand the influence of these factors upon product CQAs and process stability. To evaluate the factors affecting the process stability with a reduced amount of materials, process deviations recorded by process sensors were used. While product CQAs only depended on process CPPs, process stability was strongly affected by API CMAs. The effect of API batch-to-batch variability on process stability could nonetheless be managed by applying suitable granulation conditions. Therefore, appropriate ranges of CPPs were defined to ensure both product CQAs and process stability. By studying the fully integrated continuous manufacturing line, it was possible to highlight the interactions between the different unit operations and the API CMAs and to design a robust process.

AB In recent years, various oral dosage forms using biomaterials have been developed to deliver drugs to the colon for therapy due to the advantages of local treatment and its ideal location for drug delivery. To achieve site-specific delivery, the complete drug should be released in the colon, while the drug must be protected or their delivery minimized in the stomach and small intestine. The use of natural or synthetic polymers has been reported for these purposes. The roles of zein in drug delivery have been identified with various types of formulations for improving bioavailability, controlled drug release and targeted delivery. Although zein has been demonstrated as a potential material for pharmaceutical applications, a review of zein in the gastrointestinal tract for stabilizing drug- and colon-specific delivery is still missing. In the present review, we aim to provide typical strategies for using zein in formulations to minimize drug release/ensure drug protection in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, effective fabrications or modifications for drug release in the colon will be highlighted. This primary resource of related methods of using zein in the gastrointestinal tract will advance technologies for using it as a natural polymer for drug delivery.

AB Small interfering RNA (siRNA) represents a new class of therapeutic agents. Its successful intracellular delivery is a major challenge. Lipo-oligomeric carriers can complex siRNA into lipopolyplexes and thus mediate its cellular uptake. In this study, siRNA against the kinesin related mRNA EG5 gene (siEG5) and the microtubule inhibitor pretubulysin (PT) were co-formulated into polyplexes using azide-containing lipo-oligomer 1198. Nanoparticles were further modified by click reaction using shielding agent DBCO-PEG or EGFR targeting peptide GE11 (DBCO-PEG-GE11). Polyplexes displayed efficient payload incorporation and homogenous particle sizes of 200 nm. The biological effects of the unmodified and surface-functionalized polyplexes were investigated. The successful GE11-mediated intracellular delivery of siRNA into the EGFR overexpressing KB and Huh7 cell lines facilitated potent silencing of an EGFP-luciferase reporter gene by GFP siRNA. Specific downregulation of EG5 mRNA by siEG5 resulted in the expected antitumoral activity. The combination formulation 1198 siEG5 + PT provided superior antitumoral activity over free PT and 1198 siEG5.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of an intravenously administered combinational therapy using lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) as a drug delivery carrier for the treatment of different cancers. Therefore, we encapsulated 6 anticancer drugs within LNCs. Their size was approximately 50 nm. Except for oxaliplatin, their encapsulation efficiency, which was measured by different analytical methods, varied between 75% for SN38 to 100% for regorafenib. The in vitro studies showed a nonsignificant difference between the cytotoxicity of free and encapsulated drugs and a significant decrease in haemolysis by encapsulation in LNCs. Finally, the in vivo experiment showed that a combinational regimen of SN38-LNCs and regorafenib-LNCs abates CT26 murine colorectal cancer growth and increases median survival time.

AB The aim was to investigate the effect of constant current iontophoresis on the delivery and biodistribution of buflomedil hydrochloride (BUF) in the buccal mucosa. Quantification was by UHPLC-MS/MS; in addition to total delivery, the amounts present in the epithelia and the lamina propria (the target tissue) were also determined. Two-compartment vertical diffusion cells were used to investigate the effect of current density (0.5, 1 and 2 mA/cm(2)), application time (5, 10 and 20 min) and concentration (5, 10 and 20 mM) on iontophoretic delivery of BUF from aqueous solutions. In contrast to passive delivery, iontophoresis for 10 min at 1 mA/cm(2) resulted in statistically equivalent transport from a 20 mM solution and a 2% HEC hydrogel (with equivalent BUF loading; 20 mu mol). BUF delivery from the hydrogel using diffusion cells and a new coplanar "side-by-side" set-up was statistically equivalent (304.2 +/- 28.9 and 278.2 +/- 40.3 mu g/cm(2)) - passive delivery was also similar. Iontophoresis (10 min at 1 mA/cm(2)) using a thin film (20 mu mol BUF) was superior to the passive control (323.3 +/- 5.9 and 24.8 +/- 5.9 mu g/cm(2)). Concentrations in the LP were similar to 700-fold > IC50 to block collagen production, potentially providing a new therapeutic strategy for oral submucous fibrosis.

AB This study describes the fabrication of chemically crosslinked pectin-based LA-co-MAA hydrogels through free radical polymerization technique for the colonic delivery of oxaliplatin. Methylene bisacrylamide was used as a crosslinking agent and ammonium persulfate as an initiator. The successful fabrication and drug loading were confirmed through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The thermal investigations through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) suggested the higher thermal stability of the unloaded and OXP-loaded formulations as compared to the raw materials. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed a decrease in crystallinity after crosslinking. The swelling, drug loading, and drug release were increased with an increase in the concentration of pectin and lactic acid (LA) while methacrylic acid (MAA) displayed an inverse behavior. The in-vitro biodegradability was evaluated against lysozyme and collagenase. The results showed that the hydrogels were stable against blank PBS as compared to lysozyme and collagenase. MTT-assay proved that the blank hydrogels were cytocompatible while free OXP and OXP-loaded hydrogels displayed dose-dependent effect against Vero, MCF-7, and HCT-116 cell lines. The oral tolerability study in rabbits confirmed that the hydrogel dispersion was well-tolerable up to 3650 mg/kg of body weight without causing any histopathological or hematological changes when compared with the control group.

AB Re-activation of the healing process is a major challenge in the field of chronic wound treatment. For that purpose, lipid-nanoparticles, especially nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), possess extremely useful characteristics such as biodegradability, biocompatibility and long-term stability, besides being suitable for drug delivery. Moreover, they maintain wound moisture due to their occlusive properties, which have been associated with increased healing rates. In the light of above, NLC have been extensively used topically for wound healing; but to date, there are no safety-preclinical studies concerning such type of application. Thus, in this work, biodistribution studies were performed in rats with the NLC previously developed by our research group, using technetium-99m(Tc-99m-NLC) as radiomarker, topically administered on a wound. Tc-99(m)-NLC remained on the wound for 24 h and systemic absorption was not observed after administration. In addition, toxicological studies were performed to assess NLC safety after topical administration. The results obtained demonstrated that NLC were non-cytotoxic, non-sensitizing and non-irritant/corrosive. Overall, it might be concluded that developed NLC remained at the administration area, potentially exerting a local effect, and were safe after topical administration on wounds.

AB Conventional quantization of drug content in the liposome formulation involves the breakdown of bulk liposomes, which ignores details on the distribution of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and excipients in liposomes of different sizes. The objective of this study is to develop an analytical method which can separate the liposomes into different sizes and obtain information of the drug and excipient distribution in the different sized liposomes. We developed an asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) method for size-based separation of AmBisome, an amphotericin B liposomal formulation, and a high-performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet-visible and charged aerosol detection (HPLC-UV-CAD) method for simultaneous quantization of the API (Amphotericin B) and the lipid excipients [1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DSPG), hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine (HSPC), and cholesterol]. The measured drug content in the bulk liposome formulation was consistent with the drug product labeling. Liposomes were separated using AF4 into eleven size fractions and the liposomes particles sizes of each fraction were measured with nanoparticle tracking analysis. The drug to total lipid ratios in fractionated liposomes increased from 0.1 to 0.45 when the liposome size increased from 75 nm to 124 nm, while the lipid composition remained constant throughout the fractioned size range (cholesterol:DSPG, 0.7 and HSPC:DSPG, 0.3). These study results suggest that, for liposomal formulations of Amphotericin B in liposomes, the drug to lipid ratio increases with the size of the liposomes. This new analytical method provided a more in-depth characterization of liposomes, i.e., determining drug and excipient distributions in different sizes of liposomes, in a more efficient manner with more specific size-based composition information.

AB In this research, the volumetric scale-up law was assessed for its applicability to scale-up from a laboratory-scale extruder (11 mm diameter) to a pilot-scale extruder (16 mm diameter) with geometric similarity using low feed rates (0.1-0.26 kg/h at lab-scale). A sustained release formulation was extruded on both scales using scaled feed rates according to the volumetric scale-up law. The specific mechanical energies, drug solid-state, drug dissolution and the residence time distribution responses (i.e. axial mixing degree, mean residence time, width of distribution) were compared between both scales. The results showed that the difference in mean residence time between both scale extruders reduced with higher throughput and thus fill level. Overall, the specific mechanical energies (SME) were comparable between scales when using the volumetric scale-up law (i.e. applying scaling factor q = 3) and were exactly matching with a scaling factor of q = 2.6. Furthermore, plug flow conditions at lab-scale should be avoided before scaling up to obtain similar SMEs. The same degree of axial mixing (represented by the Peclet number) was demonstrated at a scaling factor of q = 2. If drug solid-state is a critical quality attribute (CQA), focus should be on the screw speed and cooling capacity of the larger scale extruder. The drug dissolution showed similarity between scales and was independent of drug solid-state for this formulation, indicating that successful scale-up was possible.

AB Cholesterol is one of the major structural constituents in a liposomal bilayer. Cholesterol is susceptible to various reactions in the presence of oxygen, heat, light, certain metals, and radicals during manufacturing or storage, which may cause to generate cholesterol oxidation products (COPs). Herein, we report the development of a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry based analytical method for screening and quantitating COPs present in liposomal parenteral pharmaceutical formulations (LPFs) from four different vendors. We detected and quantitated six COPs and desmosterol in LPFs, and desmosterol is an intermediate of cholesterol biosynthesis. 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol, 7 beta-hydroxycholesterol, 7-keto-cholesterol, and desmosterol were the major cholesterol-related impurities in LPFs. COPs were not detected in any of USP/NF grade cholesterol raw materials, implying that COPs were generated during liposome manufacturing and/or storage. This validated method presented here can be used to quantify cholesterol-related impurities present in liposomal pharmaceutical formulations to ensure the quality and the safety of liposomal pharmaceutical formulations.

AB Nucleic acid-based therapy has shown great promise in accelerating bone regeneration as well as other diseases. Nucleic acids used in gene therapy mainly are either plasmid DNA (pDNA) or RNAs. Although pDNA therapy has been extensively studied for decades with encouraging preclinical and clinical results, side effects, and low efficiency associated with nuclear trafficking are hard to bypass. Unlike pDNA, RNAs (mRNA, siRNA, miRNA) exert their function in the cytoplasm, thereby being more efficient in hard-to-transfect cells such as primary osteoblasts. RNA interference-based gene silencing represents a negative regulation which knockdown the expression of antagonists that impair osteogenesis process. In contrary, mRNA therapy for osteogenesis represents a positive regulation which delivers mRNA encoding growth factors to accelerate bone regeneration. This review presents a comprehensive summary of the mRNA and siRNA-based therapies and the targets for bone regeneration in case of bone defect and osteoporosis.

AB The purpose of this study is to establish a material library and discuss its potential application to the development and lifecycle management of a continuous manufacturing process for solid dosage forms. Particularly, this study addresses the importance of selecting process-relevant testing conditions for material characterization, proposes a methodology to capture relevant information with a reduced set of measurements, and correlates material properties with process performance. This study included 20 pharmaceutical materials, and each material was characterized by 44 properties, capturing 880 data points. The stress conditions of a commonly used feeder hopper were calculated using the Janssen model for six selected materials. Multivariate analysis, such as principal component analysis and clustering analysis, was used to explore the knowledge space of the material library. Statistically similar and dissimilar material properties were evaluated for material feeding performance from a loss-in-weight feeder to test utility of the material library. 20 materials included in this study show a wide range of material properties. Consolidation stress during testing significantly impacts obtained material properties. Based on a material similarly metric, a reduced set of characterization tests that captures > 95% of the relevant information was identified. Materials were then grouped into six clusters. The material loss-in-weight feeding results show that the materials within the same cluster show similar feeding performance, while selected materials from different cluster have different feeding performance. Additional material understanding regarding flow properties may be needed to implement a continuous manufacturing process. Characterization using multiple tests under process-relevant conditions can be helpful to establish the correlation between material properties and process and product performance using multivariate analysis tools.

AB In nanopharmaceutics, a robust manipulation of the preparation process and an accurate prediction of the final product size are very important for developing novel nano drug delivery systems. In the present study, for the first time, a process parameter, i.e. the length of the straight fluid jet, L, is correlated with an experimental parameter, i.e. fluid flow rate, F; a nanofiber property, i.e. diameter, D; and the corresponding drug-sustained release profile. Using a mixed solution consisting of 15% (w/v) polyacrylonitrile and 3% (w/v) ketoprofen in acetone and N,N-dimethylformamide (2:8, v:v) as a spinnable working fluid, a series of medicated nanofibers were prepared under variable F and were characterized. The analysis results disclosed the quantitative relationships among different types of parameters. The process parameter L exhibited a better linear relationship with the nanofibers' diameter (D) than the processing parameter F. These results give a hint that process parameters can be exploited as useful tools for accurately predicting and tailoring the resultant nanofibers' D, and in turn their functional performances. The strategy proposed here presents a new approach to investigate the electrohydrodynamic process and manipulate the functions of nanoproducts through process-property-performance relationships.

AB Nowadays, most of the clinically used contrast agents are based on the use of gadolinium molecular complexes like Dotarem (R), Magnevist (R).... Nevertheless, developing new gadolinium based contrast agents with enhanced relaxivity properties while avoiding gadolinium release in human tissue is still of paramount importance. We describe here two promising families of contrast agents which meets these criteria and compared their properties to the ones of clinically used Gd complexes. The first one is based on contrast agents obtained by covalent or non-covalent interactions of gadolinium molecular complexes with polymers, nanoparticles or liposomes. The second family is based on the formation of gadolinium particles (Gd2O3, GdPO4, NaGdF4, GdF3...) of controlled morphology and composition. The performance of these two families is described as well as their development perspective.

AB Breast cancer remains a major threat to women's health, and the incidence of breast cancer continues to increase each year. Paclitaxel (PTX) is commonly used to treat breast cancer, but shows limited solubility and is associated with major side effects, limiting its clinical applications. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising treatment for breast cancer but is limited by the poor solubility of photosensitizers and difficulties in targeting and enriching the tumor tissue with photosensitizers. Here, we prepared a new nanocarrier system using nanostructured lipid carriers (PTX@FA-NLC-PEG-Ce6) harboring PTX, chlorin e6 (Ce6), and folic acid-targeted head to overcome the limitations of PTX and Ce6 in hydrophobicity and increase the target efficiency of chemotherapy drugs and photosensitizers at the tumor. The results showed that the drug-loading system ma the requirements for intravenous injection, had tumor targeting ability, and could be easily taken up by MDA-MB231 cells. Moreover, Ce6 could be dissociated from the surface of the drug-loading system and evenly distributed in cells after a period of time when the nanostructured lipid carriers had entered lysosomes through endocytosis. Additionally, reactive oxygen species were then produced to induce PDT at a specific wavelength of illumination. In vitro pharmacodynamic experiments showed that combined PDT and chemotherapy had synergistic effects (combination index: 0.647). Furthermore, pharmacodynamic experiments in nude mice showed that the drug-loading system had ideal antitumor effects without obvious side effects. Thus, PTX@FA-NLC-PEG-Ce6 may have applications as a promising drug-loading system for PDT combined with chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.

ID CURING CONDITIONS; DELIVERY; DISPERSION; BEHAVIOR; DESIGN
AB The objective of this study was to investigate the applicability of water-insoluble polymers as binders for pellet drug layering to extend the drug release. Carbamazepine was layered on sugar cores in fluidized bed coater using isopropanol (IPA):water solution or aqueous dispersion of ethylcellulose, polyvinyl acetate or ammonium-methylmethacrylate copolymer. Carbamazepine release was extended with all investigated water-insoluble polymers used as binder, without an additional coating layer. Drug release from pellets layered using IPA:water polymer solutions was dependent on polymer properties such as lipophilicity and pore-forming components, while from those layered with aqueous polymer dispersions, the release was dependent on the completeness of film formation during drug layering. Curing effect was observed only for pellets layered with Aquacoat (R) ECD and Eudragit (R) RS 30D. The drug release was not affected by compression when pellets were prepared with the flexible polymers Kollidon (R) SR or Kollicoat (R) SR 30D, however, it increased when brittle polymers such as ethylcellulose or Eudragit (R) RS were used. This problem could be minimized by using a higher amount of the binder, addition of a plasticizer or using polymers of higher viscosity grade. In conclusion, the use of water-insoluble polymers as binder for pellet drug layering is an effective tool to extend the drug release without additional coating step.

AB Background: An association between Apolipoprotein E (Apo E) alleles and genotypes and diabetic nephropathy (DN) was suggested, but with inconsistent results. We tested the relationship between serum lipids, Apo E alleles and genotypes with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and DN pathogenesis.
   Methods: Study subjects comprised 1389 normoglycemic controls, and 1422 T2DM patients, of whom 825 were normoalbuminuric (DWN), and 597 presented with nephropathy (DN).
   Results: Significantly lower Apo epsilon 2, and higher Apo epsilon 4 allele frequencies was seen among T2DM patients than controls. Significantly higher frequency of epsilon 3/epsilon 4, and lower frequencies of epsilon 3/epsilon 3, epsilon 2/epsilon 3, and epsilon 4/epsilon 4 carriers was seen among T2DM cases. Apo epsilon 2-carrying individuals were more frequently found in controls than in patients, while significantly higher frequency of epsilon 4-carrying genotypes was seen in T2DM cases. Significantly higher epsilon 2, and lower epsilon 3 allele frequencies were noted for DN group compared to DWN group. Significantly higher frequency of epsilon 2-containing epsilon 2/epsilon 3 and epsilon 2/epsilon 4, and lower frequencies of epsilon 3/epsilon 3 carriers was seen among DN cases. Apo epsilon 3/epsilon 3 was associated with higher total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in DN patients, and significantly higher triglyceride levels were seen in epsilon 2/epsilon 3-carrying DN patients. Logistic regression analysis confirmed the association of Apo epsilon 3-containing epsilon 3/epsilon 3, epsilon 2/epsilon 3, and epsilon 3/epsilon 4, and Apo epsilon 2-containing epsilon 2/epsilon 4 with DN, after controlling for key covariates.
   Conclusion: The results of this case-control study provide evidence that the epsilon 2 and epsilon 3 alleles of APOE modify lipid profile, and constitute independent risk factors of DN in type 2 diabetes. The molecular mechanisms underlying this risk is discussed.

ID SEVERE THROMBOCYTOPENIA; G6B-B
AB MPIG6B has orthologous physiological effects in human and mice, which regulates platelet production and function. For this reason, germline loss-of-function mutations in this gene cause congenital thrombocytopenia that is associated with bone marrow fibrosis, organomegaly and subsequent anemia. This was described in a consanguineous Arabian family with a novel truncation mutation (p.C108*) in chromosome 6, open reading frame 25 gene, also known as MPIG6B. In our case, we identified a homozygous frameshift variation (c.392delC,p.P134Lfs*10) in a ten-month-old boy presenting with signs of pallor, splenomegaly and resistant hemocytopenia. Interestingly, this is a new form of a MPIG6B variation, which could disrupt the effector protein for the key hematopoiesis regulators. This report adds to the growing number of mutations causing complex clinical manifestations associated with pancytopenia and splenomegaly in children.

AB Background: Asthma is a complex disease with worldwide public health relevance, is related to environmental causes and a genetic predisposition. The chromosomal 17q12-21 locus has been consistently demonstrated to be associated with asthma risk. The effects of variants in the 17q12-21 locus on childhood asthma were first identified in a genome wide- association study. Since that time, those findings have been replicated in different populations but not in South American populations.
   Objective: This study aimed to investigate the role of variants in the 17q12-21 locus on asthma in a sample of Brazilian children.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted on a cohort of 1247 children. These analyses used 50 Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) in the 17q12-21 locus were genotyped as part of a genome wide association study (GWAS).
   Results: Four SNVs (rs4065275, rs12603332, rs73985228 and rs77777702) were associated with childhood asthma. The rs73985228 exhibited the strongest association across the different genetic models (OR, 95%CI 2.8, 1.44-3.21, p < 0.01). In an analysis that was stratified by atopy, two SNVs (rs73985228 and rs2715555) were found to be associated with atopic and non-atopic asthma. For the first time, we observed a significant interaction with seropositivity for the Varicella zoster virus (for rs4065275, p = 0.02, and for rs12603332, p = 0.04); i.e., the association was found in those who were seropositive but not in those who were seronegative for this virus.
   Conclusions: We confirmed the associations of variants in the 17q12-21 locus with atopic and non-atopic asthma and identified an interaction with seropositivity for the Varicella zoster virus.

AB Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play an important role in tumor biogenesis and prognosis. The glioma is a grade classified cancer, however, we still lack the knowledge on their function during glioma progression. While previous studies have shown how lncRNAs regulate protein-coding gene epigenetically, it is still unclear how lncRNAs are regulated epigenetically. In this study, we firstly analyzed the RNA-seq data systematically across grades II, IV, and IV of glioma samples. We identified 60 lncRNAs that are significantly differentially expressed over disease progression (DElncRNA), including well-known PVT1, HOTAIR, H19 and rarely studied CARDS-AS, MIR4435-2HG. Secondly, by integrating HM450K methylation microarray data, we demonstrated that some of the lncRNAs are epigenetically regulated by methylation. Thirdly, we developed a DESeq2-GSEA-ceRNA-survival analysis strategy to investigate their functions. Particularly, MIR4435-2HG is highly expressed in high-grade glioma and may have an impact on EMT and TNF alpha signaling pathway by functioning as a miRNA sponge of miR-125a-5p and miR-125b-5p to increase the expression of CD44. Our results revealed the dynamic expression of lncRNAs in glioma progression and their epigenetic regulation mechanism.

AB Background: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) formation is genetically determined, with reduced penetrance and variable expressivity. NOTCH1 is a proven candidate gene and its mutations have been found in familial and sporadic cases of BAV.
   Methods: 66 BAV patients from the GISSI VAR study were genotyped for the NOTCH1 gene.
   Results: We identified 63 variants, in heterozygous and homozygous states. Fifty-two are common polymorphisms present in almost all patients. Eleven variants are new and never yet reported: two are non-synonymous substitutions, Gly540Asp in exon 10 and Glu851Gln in exon 16; one is in the 3'UTR region and seven in introns, one corresponds to a T allele insertion in intron 27. We selected four statistically noteworthy and seven new variants identified in six BAV patients and correlated them with clinical and demographic variables and with imaging and histological parameters. Preliminary data show that four were BAV patients with isolated stenosis in patients over 60 aged. These variants may correlate with a later need for surgery for the presence of stenosis and not aortic valve regurgitation or ascending aortic aneurysm.
   Conclusions: Completing the genotyping of 62 BAV patients we found 11 new variants in the NOTCH1 gene never yet reported. These findings confirm that the identification of new, clinically remarkable biomarkers for BAV requires a deeper genetic understanding of the NOTCH1 gene variants, which could be targeted by future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

AB Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is a major cause of lower back pain, but the specific molecular mechanisms governing its development are poorly characterized. This study sought to assess to what extent HOTAIR, a long non-coding (Lnc) RNA is expressed in IDD and regulates the apoptotic death of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. We therefore used real-time qPCR to measure HOTAIR and microRNA(miR)-34a-5p in degenerative NP cells, and then validated their functional relevance via overexpressing them in these NP cells. We further verified the targets of these RNA constructs in 293 T cells through the use of a dual luciferase reporter assay. We further measured NP cell apoptosis via flow cytometry and Notchl expression via western blotting. Our results indicated that IDD was linked with decreased HOTAIR expression relative to regular NP cells, and overexpressing this lncRNA was linked to reduced apoptotic NP cell death, whereas overexpressing miR-34a-5p had the opposite effect. We found that HOTAIR served as a miR-34a-5p sponge, sequestering this miRNA and thereby down regulating genes linked to apoptosis through the Notch signaling pathway. Even in naturally degenerated NP cells, HOTAIR delayed the onset of apoptosis. Together these results reveal that a HOTAIR/miR-34a-5p/Notch1 signaling pathway may regulate the development of IDD, potentially making HOTAIR a viable target for treatment of this disease.

AB Background: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex polygenic disease with unclear mechanism. In an attempt to identify novel genes involved in beta-cell function, we harness a bioinformatics method called Loss-of-function tool (LoFtool) gene score.
   Methods: RNA-sequencing data from human islets were used to cross-reference genes within the 1st quartile of most intolerant LoFtool score with the 100th most expressed genes in human islets. Out of these genes, GNAS and EEF1A1 genes were selected for further investigation in diabetic islets, metabolic tissues along with their correlation with diabetic phenotypes. The influence of GNAS and EEF1A1 on insulin secretion and beta-cell function were validated in INS-1 cells.
   Results: A comparatively higher expression level of GNAS and EEF1A1 was observed in human islets than fat, liver and muscle tissues. Furthermore, diabetic islets displayed a reduced expression of GNAS, but not of EEFIA, compared to non-diabetic islets. The expression of GNAS was positively correlated with insulin secretory index, GLP1R, GIPR and inversely correlated with HbA(1c). Diabetic human islets displayed a reduced cAMP generation and insulin secretory capacity in response to glucose. Moreover, siRNA silencing of GNAS in INS-1 cells reduced insulin secretion, insulin content, and cAMP production. In addition, the expression of Insulin, PDX1, and MAFA was significantly down-regulated in GNAS-silenced cells. However, cell viability and apoptosis rate were unaffected.
   Conclusion: LoFtool is a powerful tool to identify genes associated with pancreatic islets dysfunction. GNAS is a crucial gene for the beta-cell insulin secretory capacity.

AB Deinococcus radiodurans is a model microorganism used for studies on DNA repair and antioxidation due to its extraordinary tolerance to ionizing radiation and other DNA-damaging agents. Various transcriptome analyses have revealed that hundreds of genes are induced and that many other genes are repressed during recovery of D. radiodurans following irradiation, suggesting that gene regulation is of great importance for the extreme resistance of this microorganism to ionizing radiation: In this article, we focus on some reported strategies that are employed by D. radiodurans to regulate the genes implicated in its extreme tolerance to ionizing radiation for a comprehensive understanding of the reasons this bacterium can survive such extraordinary stress. We expect this review to shed light on potential radioprotective agents and applications for use in a range of fields.

AB SAY-related high-mobility-group box 9 (SOX9) is a member of the SOX family of transcription factors. Accumulating evidence has shown that SOX9 plays a significant role in various malignancies. However, the role of SOX9 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains unknown. In the present study, up-regulation of SOX9 was observed in both NPC tissues and different NPC cells. Overexpression of SOX9 promoted NPC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Conversely, knock down of SOX9 inhibited NPC proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion. Mechanistically, SOX9 bound directly to the promoter region of BMP2 and increased BMP2 expression. In addition, overexpression of SOX9 activated the mTOR pathway partly through BMP2. Collectively, these results identify a novel role for SOX9 as a potential therapeutic marker for the prevention and treatment of NPC.

AB Tripartite Motif Containing 13 (TRIM13), a member of TRIM proteins, is deleted in multiple tumor types, especially in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma. The present study explored the expression and potential role of TRIM13 in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). We found that TRIM13 mRNA and protein expression was reduced in NSCLC tissues and cell lines in comparison to paired non-cancerous tissues and a human normal bronchial epithelial cell line, respectively. Overexpression of TRIM13 in NCI-H1975 and SPC-A-1 cells hampered cell proliferation. Additionally, TRIM13 overexpression increased the levels of cleaved caspase-3. TRIM13-induced NSCLC cell apoptosis was attenuated by a caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO, suggesting that TRIM13 induced cell apoptosis partially through a caspase-3-dependent pathway. Moreover, it has been reported that TRIM13 can regulate nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappa B) activity. Our data showed that TRIM13 overexpression inactivated NF-kappa B as indicated by the increased cytosolic NF-kappa B and decreased nuclear NF-kappa B. Exposure to an NF-kappa B inhibitor PDTC significantly blocked the impact of TRIM13 knockdown on cell proliferation and apoptosis, indicating the functions of TRIM13 in NSCLC cells were mediated by the NF-kappa B pathway. Finally, we demonstrated that TRIM13 overexpression suppressed tumor growth and induced cell apoptosis in vivo by using a xenograft mouse model. Collectively, our results indicate that TRIM13 behaves as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC through regulating NF-kappa B pathway. Our findings may offer a promising therapeutic target for NSCLC.

AB Members of the highly conserved pleiotropic CK1 family of serine/threonine-specific kinases are tightly regulated in the cell and play crucial regulatory roles in multiple cellular processes from protozoa to human. Since their dysregulation as well as mutations within their coding regions contribute to the development of various different pathologies, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, they have become interesting new drug targets within the last decade. However, to develop optimized CK1 isoform-specific therapeutics in personalized therapy concepts, a detailed knowledge of the regulation and functions of the different CK1 isoforms, their various splice variants and orthologs is mandatory. In this review we will focus on the stress-induced CK1 isoform delta (CK1 delta), thereby addressing its regulation, physiological functions, the consequences of its deregulation for the development and progression of diseases, and its potential as therapeutic drug target.

AB Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) refers to the myocardial dysfunction in the absence of coronary artery disease and hypertension. Recently, the role of microRNAs (miRs) in gene expression regulation has attracted much more attention. Studies have shown that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is involved in the growth, metabolism and apoptosis of myocardial cells. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the regulatory role of miR-203 in myocardial fibrosis in mice with DCM via involvement of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Firstly, mouse model of diabetes mellitus (DM) was established and injected with agomir, antagomir or IGF-1 (PI3K/Akt signaling pathway activator) for investigating the role of miR-203 in PIK3CA and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. PIK3CA was identified as a target gene of miR-203, and overexpressed miR-203 inhibited the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The obtained results indicated that up-regulation of miR-203 reduced myocardial hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, myocardial apoptosis, and levels of PIK3CA, PI3K, Akt, Cal I, CoI III, ANP, MDA and ROS in the myocardial tissues, by which DM-induced cardiac dysfunction and pathological changes could be ameliorated. Collectively, our present study highlighted that overexpression of miR-203 may function as a cardioprotective regulator in DCM by targeting PIK3CA via inactivation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

AB Objectives: To explore the clinical and molecular characteristics of a Chinese Zhuang minority patient with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type-1 (LAD-1) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDD).
   Methods: Routine clinical and physical examinations were performed, and patient data was collected and analyzed. Protein expression levels of Itgb2 and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6pd) proteins were assessed by flow cytometry and the glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) substrate method, respectively. Whole exome sequencing was performed to investigate genetic variations of the patient and his parents.
   Results: The patient had fester disease and delayed separation of the umbilical cord at birth. Staphylococcus was detected in the fluid secretion of the auditory meatus of the patient. He exhibited a recurrent cheek scab, swollen hand, and swollen gum. Hematological examination indicated dramatic elevation of leukocytes including lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils. A novel homozygous mutation was detected in the ITGB2 gene of the patient, which was determined to be a two nucleotide deletion at the site of c.1537-1538 (c.1537-1538delGT), causing a frameshift of 24 amino acids from p.513 and inducing a stop codon (p.V5I3Lfs*24). A base substitution mutation was identified at c.1466 (c.1466G > T) of G6PD on chromosome X of the patient, which resulted in an amino acid change from arginine to leucine at p.489 (p.R489L). The patient also showed deficient lymphocyte expression of CD18 (2.99%) and significant downregulation of the G6pd protein.
   Conclusions: The patient was diagnosed with G6PDD and moderate LAD-1. The combination of LAD-1 and G6PDD in this case may have been due to the high incidence of genetic disease in this minority ethnic population. Analyzing existing LAD-1 and G6PDD cases from different populations can facilitate disease diagnosis and treatment. Particularly, reporting pathogenic mutations of LAD-1 and G6PDD will be crucial for genetic testing and prenatal diagnosis in an effort to decrease the incidence of these diseases.

AB Objectives: The present study was undertaken to evaluate the cognitive profile of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and to correlate with the clinical stage and polysomnographic variables.
   Methods: The study included 25 PD patients who had RBD and 25 PD patients who based on two questionnaires were determined as not having RBD. These patients underwent overnight polysomnography (PSG) and neuropsychological assessment using a defined battery of tests.
   Results: The mean age of the patients with clinically probable RBD (RBD+) was 60.4 +/- 8.2 years and PD patients without RBD (RBD-) was 57.3 +/- 6.6 years (p = 0.14). The mean age at onset of the disease was 53.7 +/- 9.4 years for RBDthorn and 49.8 +/- 7.8 years for RBD-patients (p = 0.12). The mean Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III OFF score was 27.4 +/- 11.1 for RBDthorn and 32.7 +/- 8.2 for RBD- (p = 0.06). The total sleep time of the patients was 4.3 +/- 1.7 h with sleep efficiency of 53.8 +/- 21.0%. Patients with RBD+ were found to have significant impairment in many neuropsychological tests compared to RBD-.
   Conclusions: RBD+ patients had significant impairment in MMSE, category fluency test (FAS test), frontal assessment battery, attention (digit span backwards, Corsi span), verbal memory (story recall) and Rey's auditory verbal learning test. These patients also had poor sleep quality. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Study objective: In this study, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of eszopiclone for the treatment of primary insomnia.
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and PubMed from inception to June 2018. Additionally, we searched the ClinicalTrials.gov trials register for other relevant trials. According to participants, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) criteria, studies were included that focused on: adults diagnosed with primary insomnia, aged 18-65 and > 65 years; eszopiclone for the treatment of primary insomnia; comparison were made between eszopiclone and placebo; as well as primary outcomes, secondary outcomes, and adverse effects.
   Results: A total of six randomized trials involving 2809 patients with primary insomnia were included in our analysis. Our analysis suggested that eszopiclone was associated with significant improvements in subjective sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, number of awakenings, total sleep time at one week, two weeks, one month, three months and six months. Meanwhile, eszopiclone was associated with increased quality of sleep, ability to function, daytime alertness and sense of physical well-being at one week, one month, three months and six months. Dizziness and unpleasant taste were the most common adverse effects in elderly subgroup. Alternately, non-elderly patients may be more prone to adverse effects such as infection, pharyngitis, somnolence, unpleasant taste and dry mouth.
   Conclusion: This meta-analysis showed that eszopiclone is an effective and safe therapy option for patients with primary insomnia, especially in elderly patients. However, due to the high clinical heterogeneity in some outcomes, further standardized preparation, large-scale and rigorously designed trials are needed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a very common, yet undiagnosed, breathing disorder that has many more implications besides disrupted sleep. Its role as an independent risk factor for metabolic abnormalities such as insulin resistance (IR) and impaired glucose tolerance is becoming increasingly recognized. The main treatment for OSAHS is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), however the impact of CPAP on IR and glucose metabolism is still debated.
   Objectives: Compile all available evidence regarding the effect of CPAP on IR in non-diabetic OSA patients.
   Methods: A literature search in Medline, Epistemonikos and the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register were searched through March 2018. We included Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) comparing CPAP treatment with sham CPAP, placebo or no treatment in non-diabetic adults with OSAHS. Risk of Bias was evaluated using Cochrane tool and a meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy of CPAP in both HOMA index and fasting glucose was done. Certain of evidence was rated using GRADE approach.
   Results: Nine studies consisting of 443 participants were included. CPAP treatment significantly improved HOMA index (Mean difference = -0.39 Ui (CI, -0.69 to -0.08), p < 0.05. I2 = 57% (GRADE = LOW). However, CPAP showed no significant changes in fasting glucose (GRADE = LOW).
   Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis shows evidence that metabolic disturbances could be halted and regressed with CPAP treatment in patients with insulin resistance and OSAHS. In conclusion, treatment with CPAP could improve HOMA IR index. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective/background: Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) experience daytime sleepiness, cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms. However, the measured prevalence of clinical depression in OSA using standardized clinical assessment is currently unclear. The aims of this study were to examine the prevalence of clinical depression and antidepressant use in untreated OSA patients, to examine predictors of depression, and to conduct an exploratory meta-analysis to determine the pooled prevalence of clinical depression in this population.
   Patients/methods: In sum, 109 consecutive patients with diagnosed OSA (mean age (SD) = 52.6 (12.1) years; 43.1% female) who presented to the sleep laboratory completed a structured clinical interview for depression (SCID-IV), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), the Assessment of Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQoL) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (EES). An exploratory meta-analysis was also conducted to quantify the risk of clinical depression in untreated OSA.
   Results: Twenty-five (22.7%) participants had clinical depression based on the SCID-IV, and 24.8% were using antidepressants. Those with clinical depression had significantly poorer sleep quality and impaired quality of life. In a regression model, quality of life impairment was most strongly associated with clinical depression. Results from the meta-analysis revealed a pooled prevalence of 23% of clinical depression in OSA patients across seven studies.
   Conclusion: Clinical depression and antidepressant use is common in patients with OSA. Depression was associated with reduced quality of life and poorer subjective sleep, however it was not associated with polysomnographic measures or daytime sleepiness. Whether CPAP treatment can alleviate the burden of clinical depression needs to be determined in future studies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present the effect of exogenous sodium oxybate (GHB) in a severely tormented boy unable to sleep and unable to be anesthetized due to a lesion in the sleep initiation system involving the tracks between the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus and the reticular system. We bypassed the system by using sodium oxybate's effect on the cortical GHB and GABA(B) receptors involved in the initiation and maintenance of sleep. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Decreased short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex was described in subjects with restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease (RLS/WED). It remained to be determined whether the magnitude of SICI decrease would be similar across levels of RLS/WED severity. Moreover, it was unknown whether, in addition to decreases in SICI, changes in cortical thickness or area could be detected in subjects with RLS/WED compared to controls. The objective of this study was to compare SICI, cortical thickness, and cortical area in subjects with idiopathic mild to moderate RLS/WED, severe to very severe RLS/WED, and controls.
   Methods: The severity of RLS/WED was assessed by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Severity Scale (IRLSS). SICI and 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of subjects with RLS/WED and controls were compared. A receiver operating characteristic curve for SICI was designed for discrimination of participants with RLS/WED from controls. Cortical thickness and area were assessed by automated surface-based analysis.
   Results: SICI was significantly reduced in patients with mild to moderate and severe to very severe RLS/WED, compared to controls (one-way analysis of variance: F = 9.62, p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis predicted RLS/WED when SICI was above 35% (area under the curve = 0.79, 95% CI 0.67-0.91, p < 0.001). Analyses of the whole brain and of regions of interest did not reveal differences in gray matter thickness or area between controls and subjects with RLS/WED.
   Conclusion: SICI is an accurate cortical biomarker that can support the diagnosis of RLS/WED even in subjects with mild symptoms, but cortical thickness and area were not useful for discriminating subjects with this condition from controls. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Internet-based cognitive behavioral treatment (iCBT-I) for insomnia comprising different sleep-related cognitive and behavioral interventional components has shown some promise. However, it is not known which components are necessary for a good treatment outcome.
   Method: People suffering from insomnia (N = 104) without any other comorbid psychiatric disorders were randomized (2:2:1) to two guided internet-based self-help interventions for insomnia [multi-component cognitive behavioral self-help intervention (MCT); sleep restriction intervention for insomnia (SRT)], and care as usual [CAU]. In all three conditions, additional care or treatment was allowed. The primary outcome was insomnia severity measured with the insomnia severity index (ISI) at eight weeks. Furthermore, the two active conditions were compared regarding sleep efficacy from daily diary data over the eight weeks, and other measures from the daily protocols. Secondary outcomes included sleep quality, depressive symptoms, dysfunctional beliefs, and quality of life at post-treatment (eight weeks) and follow-up (six months after randomization).
   Results: Both conditions were more effective than CAU at post-treatment, with medium to large between-group effect sizes on the primary outcome (ISI; MCT: Cohen's d = -1.15; SRT: d = -0.68) and small to medium between-group effect sizes for secondary outcomes. Treatment gains were maintained at six-month follow-up. Active conditions did not differ from each other on all measures from pre to post, except for dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and sleep protocol data throughout the intervention. Participants in MCT were significantly more satisfied with the intervention than participants in SRT.
   Conclusions: Results of the present study indicate that CAU + MCT and CAU + SRT are both effective compared to CAU. There were no statistical differences regarding efficacy between the two active conditions, but participants in MCT reported to be more satisfied with the intervention. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: To explore the small-world properties of brain functional networks in patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) to aid diagnosis.
   Methods: A total of 29 OSAHS patients and 26 matched healthy volunteers were scanned with blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) separately, and the whole brain was divided into 90 districts via automated anatomical labeling. The matrix Z was then built through a Fisher Z transformation. Two-sample t tests were applied to evaluate the changes in small-world properties in OSAHS patients compared to the control group. The properties included E-global, E-local, and small-world parameters L-p, C-p, gamma, lambda, and sigma.
   Results: Both groups satisfied the small-world properties (sigma > 1) within the sparsity range of 0.1-0.2. However, compared with the control group, the OSAHS group performed significantly lower in C-p, E-local, and E-global (p < 0.05) and higher in L-p (p < 0.05). The gamma, sigma, and lambda values were not significantly different between the two groups.
   Conclusion: Both healthy and OSAHS patients exhibited small-world properties in functional networks, but a subset of these small-world properties in OSAHS patients performed differently. These changes will not only provide a new perspective for pathophysiological mechanisms of OSAHS but will also help in understanding the disease in terms of whole-brain functional networks.

   INSTRUMENT; ANXIETY; STRESS
AB Background: Sleep is an essential aspect of life and it is estimated that 40-80% of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) present with insomnia. Insomnia relates to difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep which can be distressing for the child with ASD and their family. Despite the high prevalence of insomnia in children with ASD there is little qualitative data on parents' perspective on the impact it has on the family unit.
   Methods: This study presents findings from a series of three focus groups representing 15 families of children with ASD who experience insomnia. Focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed intelligent verbatim. NVivo 9 software was used to enable a content analysis. Text was coded and according to its content emerging themes were identified. Six main themes to include anxiety, dietary implications, bedtime routines, social exclusion, familial implications, and educational consequences emerged.
   Results: The findings are discussed in relation to future considerations that may contribute to the development of best practice for sleep interventions for children with ASD.
   Conclusions: Qualitative data which considers parents' perceptions of familial impact of insomnia may provide in-depth information for sleep clinicians working with families which could inform clinical decisions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ADOLESCENT SLEEP; DURATION; TIME; METAANALYSIS; CHILDHOOD; AGE
AB Background: Development induces changes in sleep, and its duration has been reported to change as a function of aging. Additionally, sleep timing is a marker of pubertal maturation, where during adolescence, the circadian rhythm shifts later. Typically, this is manifested in a later sleep onset in the evening and later awakening in the morning. These changes across development seem to be universal around the world but are unlikely to persist into adulthood.
   Methods: This study utilized accelerometer data from 17,355 participants aged 16-30 years (56% female) measured by validated Polar wearables over a 14-day period. We compared sleep duration, chronotype (sleep midpoint) and weekend catch-up (ie, social jetlag) sleep across ages and regions over 242,948 nights.
   Results: The data indicate a decline in sleep duration as well as a dramatic shift in sleep onset times throughout adolescence. This continues well into early adulthood and stabilizes nearer age 30. Differences in sleep duration across ages were significant, and ranged from 7:53 h at age 16 to 7:29 h at age 30 in the sample. Additionally, there was a clear difference between females and males throughout adolescence and young adulthood: girls had longer sleep duration and earlier timed sleep in the current study. Differences in sleep were found between regions across the world, and across European areas.
   Conclusions: Both sleep duration and sleep timing go through a clear developmental pattern, particularly in early adulthood. Females had an earlier sleep midpoint and obtained more sleep. Regional differences in sleep occurred across the world. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives/Background: Prognostic counseling about the risk for developing overt neurodegenerative disorders for patients with idiopathic REM sleep-behavior disorder (iRBD) and isolated REM sleep without atonia (iRSWA) is difficult, given lack of disease-modifying interventions and uncertainty in accurate prognostication for individuals. We aimed to analyze patient and physician characteristics associated with documented prognostic discussions for patients with iRBD and iRSWA.
   Patients/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records for 138 (112 iRBD and 26 iRSWA) patients seen at the Mayo Clinic between 2012 and 2015. We analyzed physician and patient demographics, initial complaint, and other information discussed during office visits. We then comparatively analyzed the impact of physician and patient characteristics on documented prognostic discussions using Chi Square or Fischer's exact test.
   Results: Mean iRBD patient age was 65.0 +/- 13.0, and mean iRSWA age was 58 +/- 15 years. Seventy-eight (69.6%) iRBD and 22 (84.6%) iRSWA patients were men. Sixty-two (55%) iRBD and three (12%) iRSWA patients received prognostic counseling about phenoconversion risk. iRBD was a secondary complaint in 67 (59.8%). Patients over age 60 years and those having iRBD as a chief complaint more frequently received prognostic discussions than those with opposite characteristics (all p < 0.05). Patient sex and antidepressant use were not associated with counseling. Sleep neurologists disclosed prognostic information most frequently, with male more likely than female clinicians to disclose prognoses.
   Conclusions: Several patient and physician characteristics appear to influence documented prognostic counseling for iRBD/RSWA patients. Future studies of iRBD/RSWA patients' preferences are needed to clarify ethically appropriate physician-patient communication concerning prognosis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with sympathetic overactivity. Intermittent hypoxemia and repetitive arousals are the proposed mechanisms; however, the main contributing factor for sympathetic overactivity remains to be determined. We therefore investigated the independent effect of apnea or arousal on sympathetic activity in a large cohort of OSA patients using heart rate variability analysis.
   Methods: Frequency domain heart rate variability parameters were measured and compared between 782 patients with OSA (198 mild, 259 moderate, 325 severe) and 119 non-OSA controls. Univariate analysis was performed to identify associations between clinical and polysomnographic variables and heart rate variability measurements. Multivariate analysis was further performed to determine the potential contributing factors for sympathetic overactivity.
   Results: Patients with OSA exhibited overall alterations in heart rate variability measures indicating sympathetic overactivity compared to controls, and this tendency was more pronounced in those with severe OSA. Univariate analysis showed that both apnea-hypopnea and arousal indices correlated with increased sympathetic activity and decreased parasympathetic activity. In multivariate analysis, arousal index was found to be more closely associated with sympathetic overactivity than apnea-hypopnea index.
   Conclusion: The present study showed that arousal may be a more potent contributing factor than apnea for sympathetic overactivity in OSA patients. Our results suggest that arousal index, rather than apneahypopnea index, could be considered as a surrogate marker for sympathetic overactivity in OSA. Further longitudinal studies should elucidate causal relationship between arousals and sympathetic overactivity in patients with OSA. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A combined field and numerical study of water flow and solute transport was conducted along a clean transect of a tidal gravel beach in Smith Island, Prince William Sound (PWS) that was heavily polluted after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Water table and pore water salinity were directly measured in the field. The numerical model MARUN, validated with the field observations, was used to simulate subsurface flow and dissolved salt transport processes. Our study identified a two-layer hydraulic structure in the beach, a high-permeability upper layer and a low-permeability layer at the bottom. Numerical simulations indicated that the density gradient between the saltwater and freshwater strongly affects solute transport in the intertidal zone of the beach. A sensitivity study indicated that depth to and slope of the bedrock had major effects on solute transport in the lower layer, but minor effects in the upper layer. A deep bedrock caused the water particles travelling in the lower layer to penetrate deeper in the beach. Our study revealed high terrestrial freshwater recharge to the transect which promotes the removal of oil in two-layer beaches by maintaining the water table at or above the interface of the two layers. The study presented in this paper has strong implications on the oil persistence and associated removal strategies along the Alaskan coastline polluted with oil. Findings from this work in relation to oiled beaches include: 1) oil tends to persist at locations of small freshwater recharge and 2) Prior to oil arriving to the shoreline, one could minimize oil penetration into the beach by releasing water onto the beach at the high tide line during low tides.

AB The changes in runoff and sediment load due to various approaches in land use management have recently received considerable attention. In the present paper, the impact of land use change under collaborative management framework on water and sediment load was investigated by combined usage of hydrologic modelling and land use maps. Three groups of stakeholders viz. residents, policy makers and executive organizations were involved in decision making process. Three prioritization procedures of Condorcet, Borda scoring and Fallback bargaining were elected to rank sub-watersheds and managerial practices. The impact of different managerial scenarios was assessed by applying time-area concept and through analyzing changes in important components of output hydrographs and sediment graphs. Results demonstrated significant agreement among stakeholder's attitudes and quantitative outcomes. The results illustrated obvious impact on runoff and sediment resulted from scenarios for land use management. So that, the impact on sediment load (with maximum reduction benefit of 19.41%) was significantly greater than that of runoff (with maximum reduction benefit of 8.07%). Manipulation of farmlands and poor rangelands and afforestation caused recognizable reduction on runoff and sediment. Rangelands restoration also satisfied socioeconomic status and environmental criterion of the study area. Considering basic differences in prioritization procedures, there were considerable agreement among stakeholders in land use management and practice prioritization. The results further indicated that the watershed management projects should focus on remediation of vegetation cover of the rangelands, which simultaneously tackles land degradation and improves economic condition. However, the present study revealed lack of proper connection between residents and authorities. Nevertheless, as a pioneer comanagement endeavor, the present qualitative and quantitative results facilitate group decision making and participated planning procedure at the watershed scale.

AB Daily streamflow prediction is important for flood warning, navigation, sediment control, reservoir operations and environmental protection. The current paper examines the prediction and estimation capability of a new heuristic method, optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OP-ELM) model, for daily streamflows of Fujiangqiao and Shehang stations at Fujiang River. Prediction accuracy of OP-ELM method is compared with other soft computing models, i.e. adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system-particle swarm optimization (ANFIS-PSO), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and M5 model tree (M5Tree) using cross validation technique. Prediction results of the both stations reported that the OP-ELM and ANFIS-PSO are the best in modeling daily streamflows of upstream and downstream, respectively. For improving prediction accuracy of the OP-ELM method, various kernel types are tried and the linear, linear + sigmoid + Gaussian and linear + sigmoid provide the best results for both stations. The OP-ELM outperforms the other methods during estimation of downstream streamflow using hydro climatic data as input. The OP-ELM reduces the prediction error of ANFI-SPSO by 12% in estimation of daily streamflow. It is also found that including local data considerably improves the prediction accuracy in estimation of downstream streamflows. The overall results indicate that the OP-ELM method could be successfully used in predicting and estimating daily streamflow by using hydro climatic data as inputs.

AB A framework for joint verification of river flow and precipitation ensembles is developed and demonstrated over Britain for eventual use in an operational flood forecasting setting. The river flow ensembles are obtained from a distributed hydrological model, the G2G model, using an ensemble of 15 min precipitation accumulations as input on a 1 km grid. The precipitation ensemble consists of operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) forecasts from the Met Office Unified Model. Both hourly and daily precipitation accumulations are verified, and the relevance of different accumulation periods discussed in the context of timing errors and hydrological response. The implications of precipitation observation error are investigated by comparing verification results from raingauge- and radar-derived precipitation estimates. Challenges of verification using only a limited record of precipitation ensembles, from a system only relatively recently made operational, are addressed. Methods of obtaining more robust verification statistics, given the available ensembles, are presented and demonstrated for an example period in December 2015. For precipitation, percentile thresholds are used to ensure a given number of threshold crossing events for analysis using a contingency table and derived skill scores. For river flow, percentiles thresholds are of less relevance to operational flood guidance. Instead, exceedance of a flow threshold of given rarity (return-period) is used as a surrogate measure of flood severity. At the regional scale, both river flow and precipitation verification analyses are found to be dependent on the locations considered. This is linked to variations in precipitation amount. For river flows, catchment properties - and in particular catchment size - are found to be a key influence on verification. It is demonstrated how such behaviour can be used to obtain more-robust river flow verification statistics at sub-regional scales.

AB Understanding the impact of climate change on borehole yields from fractured aquifers is essential for future water resources planning and management. Although variation in hydraulic conductivity with depth (VKD) in fractured aquifers is a well-known phenomenon, the relative significance of climate change and VKD on borehole yield estimates is poorly understood. We hypothesize that VKD exerts a significant additional control on borehole yields under climate change that has not been considered in yield assessments to date. We developed a simple two-layered radial groundwater flow model of an idealised pumping borehole in the fractured Chalk aquifer of south-east England, and applied 11 VKD profiles based on a simple conceptual representation of variation in hydraulic conductivity with depth in the Chalk. For each time step, the transmissivity is calculated by integrating the VKD profile over the saturated depth calculated at the previous time step, For each VKD profile and resulting transmissivity, we applied 20 climate scenarios and six constant pumping rates for the period 1962-2014. We then estimated borehole yields based on the derived lowest pumping water levels during key drought years (e.g. 1976). We show that the hydraulic properties of the aquifer are more significant (p < 0.001) than changes in climate (p > 0.1) in controlling lowest pumping groundwater levels when abstraction rates are < 9000 m(3)/day, and that both are significant when abstraction 9000 m(3)/day. Hydraulic conductivity is as significant a control as climate on borehole yields, although responses are non-linear associated with whether pumping water level-pumping rate curves intersect key yield constraints (e.g. pump intake depth, major inflow horizons). It is recommended that variations in hydraulic conductivity with depth are taken into consideration in future assessments of borehole yields under climate change. The approach presented is generic and can be applied across different aquifers where vertical heterogeneity is present and affects transmissivity.

AB Frequent occurrence of flood and ice disasters caused by river channel sedimentation in the Upper Yellow River of China has seriously threatened the lives and property of downstream residents, which has become the most challenging issues in harnessing the Yellow River. In this paper, we aim at optimizing water-sediment regulation that considers two cascade reservoirs (Longyangxia and Liujiaxia) as the regulatory bodies using one multi-objective model (sediment transport and hydropower generation) and two single-objective models (sediment transport only, and hydropower generation only). We propose an innovative approach (FSS-MOPSO) that hybrids the Feasible Search Space (FSS) with the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm to search the optimal solutions for the multi-objective joint operation of cascade reservoirs. We analyze the transformation rules of water-sediment regulation among five objectives (hydropower generation, sediment transport, water supply, flood control and ice control) under various optimization schemes. The results indicate that the conflict between the hydropower generation objective and the sediment transport objective is prominent. An extreme case indicates that an increase in hydropower output by 2.31 billion kWh (17.6% increase) would greatly reduce the amount of sediment transport (73.5% decrease) while only makes little effects on the other three objectives. The results demonstrate that the optimal water-sediment regulation not only can ensure to meet water demands in the future (2030) but can provide an important guideline to safely operate cascade reservoirs during ice and flood periods. The research findings contribute to the identification of the relationship among objectives and strategy recommendations on water-sediment regulation for efficient cascade reservoirs operation in the Upper Yellow River.

AB Blending satellite-based precipitation estimation (SPE) data and in-situ gauge observation data can generate effective spatially-continuous-precipitation estimates with improved accuracy. This study assessed the improvement of the long-term SPE when blending with in-situ gauge observations for drought monitoring, using a simple but effective blending method named the geographical difference analysis (GDA) method and with the Precipitation Estimation from Remote Sensed Information by using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Records (PERSIANN-CDR) as case study. In-situ precipitation observations from three meteorological station sets with different densities-the sparse (50), medium (200), dense (727) station set-were adopted to evaluate the effect of gauge density on the performance of SPE-gauge data blending. Two widely-used indices-standardized precipitation index (SPI) and self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index (SC_PDSI)-were used as case studies. Except the case of sparse 50-station subset, the SPE-gauge blending shows apparent improvement to the raw PERSIANN-CDR data, for both the accuracy of precipitation input and many aspects of drought monitoring, e.g. reproducing drought magnitude and revealing spatial pattern of drought, in which SC_PDSI shows more significant improvement than SPI. The dense 727-station set shows the largest improvement in the blending data, but the corresponding station-only interpolations also exhibit comparable performance to the blending data, indicating lower utilization value of the SPE data for these cases. Only the blending results of the medium-density 200-station set shows satisfactory drought monitoring performance as well as significant improvements relative to the station-only interpolations. According to the quantitative analyses, the medium density (about 50-75 gauges per 10(6) km(2) in our cases) might be the most economic gauge density for SPE-gauge blending, as it has satisfactory improvement in blending results, can make fullest use of the advantages of SPE data and requires relatively fewer gauges. Our results can help to understand how the SPE-gauge blending could improve the SPE-based drought monitoring and serves as a reference for applying drought monitoring under the data-limited conditions. Subsequent studies or applications should also carefully consider the effect of gauge density.

AB Climate variability and land use/cover change have a significant impact on hydrological regimes, especially in arid and semi-arid regions, which have critical water shortage problems. Using the Mann-Kendall's test methodology, trends in hydro-climatic variables including precipitation, temperature, land use, and water balance indicators have been detected during the last 60 years in the Middle Yellow River Basin (MYRB). Generally, the MYRB has become much warmer and drier. Compared with 1980, the land use has also changed - to a small degree by 2000 and to a significant degree by 2015, with an increase in vegetation coverage. There are decreasing trends for streamflow and water resources and a shift in water balance, with less precipitation generating streamflow and more water being evaporated, especially after 2000. The response of water balance to climate change and land use/cover change, and the attribution for streamflow decrease was analyzed in the 10 sub-regions of the MYRB, based on the regionalization of parameter w of Fu's Formula. The results indicate that with an increase of E-0/P (potential evaporation/precipitation) or w, there is an increase of ET/P (evapotranspiration/precipitation) and a decrease of R/P (streamflow/precipitation). But, the increasing rate of ET/P decreases with an increase of E-0/P or w. Based on the "natural period" streamflow of 1956-1979, climate variability accounts for 75.8% of streamflow decrease in 1980-2000. But in 2001-2016, land use/cover change is the main factor in streamflow decrease, accounting for 75.5% of the decline. The results are useful for understanding what has happened and what will happen under climate change and land use/cover change, for adaption to future water resources management.

AB River ice plays an important role in biophysical and socio-economic systems in northern regions and is related to climate variability at both regional and global scales. The objective of this study was to estimate river ice thickness using several new machine learning methods: extreme learning machine (ELM), least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), and their bootstrap versions (BELM and BLSSVM, respectively). To explore the usefulness of these methods, we chose two stations, Mackenzie River and Yellowknife River in the Mackenzie River Basin in the Northwest Territories, Canada. The variables used to develop the river ice thickness (cm) estimation models included: water flow (m(3)/s), snow depth (cm) and mean air temperature (degrees C) (with a time period of 1981-2016). Two techniques, namely the Kendall-Theil Robust Line (KTRL) and the regularized expectation maximization (RegEm) methods, were utilized to fill in the missing values in the time series records. The performance of the developed models was measured using several statistical indicators (correlation coefficient (r), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), their normalized equivalents expressed as a percentage (root mean square percentage error (RMSPE) and mean absolute percentage error (RMPE)), bias error (BIAS) and Willmott's Index (WI)). Results indicated that the bootstrap ELM model outperformed the ELM, LSSVM and BLSSVM models in the testing phases based on a number of statistical measures. For the BELM using RegEM at the Mackenzie River station, the results were: r = 0.826, RMSE = 19.756 cm, RMSPE = 33.011%, MAE = 15.364 cm, MAPE = 35.988%, BIAS = 1.199 cm and WI = 0.818. For the BELM using KTRL at the Yellowknife River station, the results were: r = 0.856, RMSE = 15.444 cm, RMSPE = 19.468%, MAE = 12.006 cm, MAPE = 19.045%, BIAS = 0.966 cm and WI = 0.868. The findings of this study indicate that the BELM machine learning approach using meteorological variables is a promising new tool for river ice thickness estimation.

AB Calibrating a spatially distributed hydrological model of a region with complex and highly diverse agricultural settings is a difficult task. It becomes even more challenging, if major parts of the hydrology are human controlled, e.g. through irrigation agriculture. In this study, a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was set up and calibrated for an entirely managed meso-scale irrigation scheme, where irrigation channels are the only water-courses and no natural streams exist. An automated and spatially distributed model calibration was applied, implementing the global Dynamically Dimensioned Search Algorithm (DDS), and using Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) as objective function. To account for the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of water balance fluxes in the calibration process, remote sensing-derived evapotranspiration (ET) estimates with a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km, were used as observational data. Results showed that the automated and spatially distributed model calibration was able to increase the model ET simulation performance from 0.04 to 0.27 KGE. However, a strong land-use dependent goodness-of-fit, ranging from approx. -0.60 KGE to 0.60 KGE for individual land-use types, revealed that the information, extracted from remote sensing-derived ET estimates used in this study, is lacking the necessary spatial heterogeneity. An unsatisfactory spatial comparison between simulated ET and ET derived from remote sensing estimates showed to inhibit better calibration results for the study area, which is characterized by small-scale and diverse cropping patterns. Using a modified remote sensing-derived ET product, which accounts for land-use class dependent ET characteristics, improved the overall calibration results to 0.40 KGE. A cross-validation could indicate a successful application of this automated and spatially distributed model calibration approach, using the modified ET product.

AB Flood changes may be attributed to drivers of change that belong to three main classes: atmospheric, catchment and river system drivers. In this work, we propose a data-based attribution approach for selecting which driver best relates to variations in time of the flood frequency curve. The flood peaks are assumed to follow a Gumbel distribution, whose location parameter changes in time as a function of the decadal variations of one of the following alternative covariates: annual and extreme precipitation for different durations, an agricultural land use intensification index, and reservoir construction in the catchment, quantified by an index. The parameters of this attribution model are estimated by Bayesian inference. Prior information on one of these parameters, the elasticity of flood peaks to the respective driver, is taken from the existing literature to increase the robustness of the method to spurious correlations between flood and covariate time series. Therefore, the attribution model is informed in two ways: by the use of covariates, representing the drivers of change, and by the priors, representing the hydrological understanding of how these covariates influence floods. The Watanabe-Akaike information criterion is used to compare models involving alternative covariates. We apply the approach to 96 catchments in Upper Austria, where positive flood peak trends have been observed in the past 50 years. Results show that, in Upper Austria, one or seven day extreme precipitation is usually a better covariate for variations of the flood frequency curve than precipitation at longer time scales. Agricultural land-use intensification rarely is the best covariate, and the reservoir index never is, suggesting that catchment and river drivers are less important than atmospheric ones. Not all the positive flood trends correspond to a significant correlation between floods and the covariates, suggesting that other drivers or other flood-driver relations should be considered to attribute flood trends in Upper Austria.

AB In this study the suitability of precipitation waters as semi-artificial and multi-component groundwater tracers is investigated and potential applications as well as limitations are discussed. Specifically, we analyzed their migration behavior during laboratory-scale experiments with groundwater-saturated porous media. Artificially H-2- and O-18-labelled water as well as natural precipitation waters were injected into sediment-packed columns and traced via stable isotope analysis. Their migration behavior was compared to that of widely used tracers. These flow-through experiments were underpinned by a batch reactor study and by hydrogeochemical modeling. While most artificial isotope applications showed a high stability and conservative transport behavior for all tested sediments, the breakthrough curves observed in some experiments with rain and snowmelt were unsteady. This was most likely caused by the small ratio between the tracer's isotopic difference compared to the background signal and the available analytical precision. The minimum ratio required for effectively reducing uncertainties during data evaluation showed to depend significantly on experimental conditions but should not decrease below 10 during peak breakthrough and preferably be higher. Furthermore, our study illustrates that measurements based on using the precipitation waters' inherent low electrical conductivity can be significantly biased by water-sediment reactions. The batch study and reactive transport simulations confirmed this observation while revealing mineral reactions and, to a minor extent, also ion exchange as the underlying processes.

AB In this present study, a novel approach is introduced for accurate prediction of the incipient motion of uniform grain particles in sand and gravel-bedded open channels under unidirectional flow by improving Sugeno Fuzzy Inference System (Sugeno FIS). The Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) tool is based on Sugeno FIS. Consequent part of the ANFIS tool is limited to either as a constant or a linear function. This means that not only a non-linear function is available for the consequent part of the model but also it cannot be represented by the constant and linear functions, at the same time. ANFIS tool optimizes antecedent parameters (fuzzy sets) and consequent parameters (constant or linear functions) by utilizing neural and least square methods, respectively. In this study, a novel hybrid model named as Geno-Fuzzy Inference System (GENOFIS) is introduced by integrating improved Sugeno FIS and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) that refer to where, the antecedent (fuzzy sets) and consequent (constant, linear and non-linear functions) parameters are optimized using Genetic Algorithms (GAs) tool. A quantitative comparison is implemented between the ANFIS and GENOFIS models using root mean square error (RMSE) and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (CE) as evaluation criteria by using three different types of incipient motion of sediment measurements that exist in the literature as reference, visual and development of competence functions. The results of this present study demonstrated that the novel GENOFIS model provided more accurate prediction results in comparisons with the ANFIS model results for three different types of incipient motion of sediment.

AB Himalayan headwater rivers are sourced from glacier meltwater and from Indian summer monsoon (ISM) precipitation, both of which are strongly influenced by ongoing and future climate change. Hydrologic modeling studies indicate that the glacier meltwater contribution is highest during the hot, summer pre-ISM months, but this hypothesis cannot be rigorously tested due to lack of observational data. To provide new spatial and temporal constraints on water source contributions in Himalayan streams, we measured stable water isotopes (O-18/O-16 and H-2/H-1, expressed as delta O-18 and delta D) and temperature compensated electrical conductivity in nested catchments throughout the Upper Ganges Basin across three seasons: pre-ISM (April-June), ISM (July-September), post-ISM (October-December) over three years (2014-2016). For all time points we observed a sharp decrease in delta O-18 and delta D values moving toward higher elevations. To interpret these results, we tested two environmental tracer approaches for water source apportionment. Using a new isotope mixing approach, our analyses reveal large seasonal variability in water source contributions from glacier meltwater, precipitation, and groundwater to streamflow throughout the basin. Electrical conductivity, delta O-18, and deuterium excess were also analyzed through optimum multiparameter analysis (OMPA). Results from our isotope mixing model and OMPA are in close agreement. Glacier meltwater contributions were highest during the ISM and post-ISM seasons, contrary to previous model predictions. In addition to protracted release of glacier meltwater, this result is consistent with "rain-induced" glacier melting during the ISM, which we show can produce 3-11% of total discharge at the glacier snout. Glacier meltwater contributions to Himalayan streams exhibit complex seasonal dynamics; such contributions should be considered when predicting hydrologic responses to climate change in this region.

AB The precipitation forecasts from numerical weather prediction have a variety of potential uses in flood forecasting and reservoir operation, but suffer from relatively poor performance due to the uncertainty of the hydrometeorological system. In this study, the control forecasts of four global weather centres were selected and assessed against the measured data using several verification metrics during the flood season (May-September) over the Shihe River catchment in the Huaihe River basin of China. The results show that the daily rainfall forecasts have low prediction ability and cannot meet the demand of reservoir regulation. To describe the uncertainty of precipitation forecasts for the safety of flood control, a new model was proposed using fuzzy probability and Bayesian theory on the basis of the generalized probability density function (GPDF). The performance of the new model is examined by using various probability measures and compared with the ensemble forecasts generated by the weather centres. It is proved that the fuzzy Bayesian model can generate the conditional probability distribution of actual precipitation from a single predicted value based on the historical observation and forecast data, and has strong generalization ability. Compared with the ensemble forecasts, although the fuzzy Bayesian model shows a slightly improvement in accuracy, it has better performance in sharpness and reliability. Meanwhile, the new model is easy to update with new samples by modifying its likelihood function, which is favourable for real-time reservoir regulation. In addition, the uncertainty of the precipitation forecast was analysed with the model in different lead times. Generally, the uncertainty increases with the growth of lead time, and the probability distribution of the rainfall forecast within 3 days is an acceptable result for a risk and benefit analysis of the flood control system. To be more specific, a fuzzy Bayesian model based on the GPDF is an efficient way to generate the probability distribution of the precipitation with forecast data for the uncertainty analysis, and makes it possible to provide a reference for reservoir managers to plan regulation strategies with a lead time of at least 3 days.

AB Water quality is a sensitive topic of worldwide concern that is defined by a series of physical, chemical and biological characteristics. The complex nature for studying water quality requires finding simple models to identify the variables that influence it the most. Therefore, the use of multivariate analysis techniques will be of immense help to find relationships and conclusions which aid us to determine the state of water quality through biological, physical and chemical indicators. In this investigation, the following variables were evaluated: Temperature, pH, transparency, turbidity, nitrates, orthophosphates, phosphorus, total nitrogen, chlorophyll a, solar radiation, dissolved oxygen and microcystins. These determined water quality at the sample sites, Gamboa and Paraiso. The results obtained through the application of a two-way multivariate analysis method called HJ-Biplot reflect variables relationships of chemical, physical and biological compositions. Furthermore, results conform two clusters of sample points that satisfactorily match to the region seasons. Cluster 1 is characterized by the presence of the following variables: pH, transparency, chlorophyll a, oxygen and temperature. On the other hand, cluster 2 comprises the following variables: nitrate, orthophosphates, turbidity and P-total. They are all parameters that suffer variations in the rainy season, and that, in turn, can influence the presence of ciabobacteria with toxigenic potential. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the multivariate statistical methods are valuable for interpreting complex data sets, specifically, for water quality monitoring network.

AB Lake level regulation is commonly used to manage water resources and mitigate flood risk in watersheds with linked river-lake systems. In this study, we first assess exposure, in terms of both population and land area, to flooding impacts in the Yahara Watershed's chain of four lakes in southern Wisconsin as affected by minimum lake level management. A flooding exposure assessment shows that the areas surrounding the upstream lakes, Mendota and Monona, have dense urban areas with high populations that are exposed to flooding; Waubesa has low elevations along its lakeshore, resulting in a large potential flooding area; and the most downstream lake, Kegonsa, has a large area of surrounding cropland that is exposed to flooding but impacts a limited population. We then use a linked modeling framework of a land surface model (Agro-IBIS) and a hydrologic-routing model (THMB) to simulate daily lake level over a study period of 1994-2013 in the Yahara Watershed with different minimum lake level management strategies. Modeling results show that the peak lake levels and corresponding exposed land area and population to flooding will decrease under a lower target minimum lake level. However, at the same time, the number of days that the lake level is below winter minimum will increase, which may adversely affect ecosystem health. In addition, our sensitivity analysis indicates that reducing target minimum lake levels will help mitigate flood risk in terms of both flood magnitude and frequency. Nevertheless, this must be balanced against the need to maintain adequately high lake levels for ecosystem services and recreational functions of the lakes.

AB Snow avalanches are among the most destructive natural hazards threatening human life, ecosystems, built structures, and landscapes in mountainous regions. The complexity of snow avalanche modelling has been discussed in many studies, but its modelling is not well-documented. Snow avalanche modeling in this study was done using three main categories of data, including avalanche occurrence locations, meteorological factors, and terrain characteristics. Two machine learning models, namely support vector machine (SVM) and multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA), were employed. A ratio of 70 to 30 of data was considered for calibrating and validating the models. Results indicated that both models had an excellent performance in snow avalanche modeling (area under curve, AUC > 90), although hits and misses analysis demonstrated the superior performance of MDA. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the topographic position index, slope, precipitation, and topographic wetness index were the most effective variables for modeling. A snow avalanche map indicated that the high snow avalanche hazard zone was mostly near the streams and was matched with hillsides around the water pathways. Findings of study can be helpful for land use planning, to control snow avalanche paths, and to prevent the probable hazards induced by it, and it can be a good reference for future studies on modeling snow avalanche hazards.

AB The availability of Quebec (Canada) river temperature data has improved significantly in recent years, with increased monitoring effort and sharing of existing data. Although it is now recognized that this variable is of central interest in a variety of instream habitat issues, the actual interpretation and use of the data by managers and researchers can be challenging, due to the spatial sparsity of the measurement sites and to the unevenness of the length of the temperature time series. In this paper, we propose a model for all Quebec rivers thermal regimes, as a means to interpret and exploit the available river temperature data. The model, based on fitting a Gaussian function to time series of interannual mean daily temperatures, was used to characterize the thermal regime at more than 400 locations in Quebec rivers. The three parameters of the model (annual maximum, date of annual maximum and length of the warm season) allowed to produce a first map of Quebec river thermal regimes. A method to quantify the uncertainty on the parameters estimation, taking into account the length of the time series and the interannual variability of the river temperature, is presented. Finally, stepwise regressions were used to investigate the relationships between the model parameters and the physioclimatic characteristics of the basins upstream of the measurement sites.

AB The Kinematic Wave Model (KWM), representing a simplification of the Full Wave Model (FWM) under the shallow-water approximation, is often used in the one-dimensional formulation for describing the dynamics of debris/mud flood. The present work investigates the applicability conditions of the KWM to analyze mud floods, characterized by a rheological behaviour expressed through a power-law model. The study is carried out through the numerical solution of both the Full and Kinematic Wave models changing the characteristic time of hydrograph, i.e. the wave duration, imposed at the channel inlet. The predictions of the two models are compared in terms of maximum flow depth, maximum discharge and peak discharge at the downstream channel end. The study is performed for several values of the Froude (F) and the Kinematic Wave (K) numbers. Similarly to the clear-water case, present results show that higher errors in applying KWM pertain to shorter flood wave durations, but the performance of KWM appears to strongly depend on the value of the rheological index, becoming worse as the fluid rheology becomes more shear-thinning. The study furnishes applicability criteria representing a guideline for practical applications in terms of minimum wave duration above which the KWM error in reproducing the considered flood characteristics (the maximum flow depth, the maximum discharge and the peak discharge at the downstream channel end) is less or equal than 5%. Finally, it has been shown that the wave period criterion, obtained considering linearized wave dynamics, may be safely applied at least for fluid with moderate shear-thinning behavior and for moderate values of the dimensionless number KF2.

AB Fecal contamination poses a threat to groundwater supplies in low income regions. This is often due to the coexistence of pit latrines with domestic wells in densely populated areas. In this context, developing alternative methodologies to map fecal pollution in shallow wells is needed. A thorough survey of over 240 domestic wells and 570 pit latrines was conducted in a rural town of southern Mali. Water samples were collected from all wells and tested for temperature, pH, electric conductivity, total dissolved solids, turbidity and thermotolerant coliforms. The outcomes of the field survey were incorporated into a GIS database. Thirteen machine leaning classifiers, including different statistical algorithms, instance-based learners and tree-based models, were used to determine the spatial distribution of fecal pollution as per five explanatory variables (latrine density, distance to the closest latrine, borehole yield, water table depth and population density). The best performing classifiers, selected on test scores, were then used to develop predictive maps. Random forest and logistic regression rendered prediction scores for fecal pollution in excess of 0.90. Multilayer perceptrons, support vector machines and quadratic discriminant analyses also proved adept at forecasting fecal pollution. Ensemble mapping shows that 30-50 m buffers around domestic wells may be sufficient to prevent contamination of domestic supplies in most instances. This demonstrates that machine learning may provide a versatile methodological alternative to traditional Darcian approaches. On the other hand, the practical difficulties involved in maintaining wellhead protection areas suggests the need to implement piped water supplies.

AB In this study, three single Artificial Intelligence (AI) based models i.e., Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a linear Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model as well as three different ensemble techniques i.e., Simple average ensemble (SAE), weighted average ensemble (WAE) and neural network ensemble (NNE) are applied for single and multi-step ahead modeling of dissolve oxygen (DO) in the Yamuna River, India. In this context, DO, Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Discharge (Q), pH, Ammonia (NH3), Water Temperature (WT) data for three different stations i.e., Hathnikund (SL1), Nizamuddin (SL2) and Udi (SL3) recorded by central pollution control board were used. The performance accuracy of the models was determined using Determination Coefficient (DC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The obtained results of the single models showed that, ANFIS model outperformed all other three models and increased averagely up to 7% and 19% for SL1 and SL2 in performance accuracy while for SL3, SVM model performed better than other models and increased the average performance up to 16%. In the ensemble techniques, the results showed that, for all the three stations, NNE could increase the average performance by single models up to 14% in the verification phase. This justified the reliability and robustness of NNE in multi-step ahead modeling of DO due to its promising ability in solving nonlinear processes.

AB Frequent droughts in a warming climate may exert more negative influences on ecosystems. Unlike previous studies that have investigated the vegetation response to drought generally in a deterministic way, a copula-based model is developed for quantifying drought impacts on terrestrial vegetation and identifying drought-vulnerable regions for mainland China from a probabilistic perspective in this study. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is firstly correlated with the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at varying timescales from 1 month to 24 months to determine the response time of vegetation to water variability. Then, the dependence structure of vegetation vigor and water availability is modeled through the bivariate copula analysis. Furthermore, conditional probabilities of vegetation decline under moderate, severe and extreme drought scenarios are systematically estimated using copula-based conditional probability distributions. Results indicate that spatial patterns of vegetation response time present distinct seasonality, with faster response to water variation in the southern part than in the northern proportion of mainland China during the non-growing season while the inverse pattern is observed for the growing season. The higher conditional probabilities of the below-average vegetation status in the dry condition evidence that water deficits overwhelming water surplus play a more profound role in diminishing vegetation vigor across more than 80% of mainland China. Specifically, when moderate droughts develop into extreme ones, the average probability of vegetation status below the 50th percentile escalates by 6.9%. Moreover, extreme droughts are noted to exaggerate probabilities of vegetation activity falling below the increasingly lower (40th, 30th, 20th and 10th) percentiles by 8.8%, 10.8%, 12.7% and 13.7% in comparison with moderate counterparts, thereby suggesting higher likelihood of the deteriorating drought conditions inducing vegetation losses, especially major vegetation decline. As for the drought-vulnerable region, North China, particularly the central Inner Mongolia, is recognized with vegetation decline probabilities being 28.1% and 68.8% greater than the mainland average given drought conditions (quantified as SPEI <= -1), respectively. Results of the study may improve our understanding of climatic extreme influence on vegetation status and benefit the effective drought preparedness and mitigation.

AB Accurate estimation of mean flow velocity is imperative for the prediction of hydrographs and sediment yield. The Chezy and Manning equations are the most widely used for calculating flow velocity in runoff and erosion models. The suitability of both equations for overland flow on bare land has been evaluated, and conflicting results were obtained in previous studies. The suitability of these equations for overland flow on a planted slope requires further investigation. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the suitability of the Chezy and Manning equations under planted conditions and evaluate quantitative effect of vegetation on Manning's n and then on flow velocity. Flume experiments were conducted at the plant basal cover ranging from 0 to 30%, slope gradient varying from 8.8% to 25.9%, and flow discharge ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 x 10(-3) m(3) s(-1). The flow depth and flow velocity were measured. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) were used to compare the performance accuracy of both equations. The results showed that both equations provided a bad accuracy when plant basal cover was greater than 15% on a planted slope. The NSE values were negative for Manning equation and close to 0 for Chezy equation. It indicates that Manning and Chezy equations were not suitable for the planted slope. Manning's n decreased with the flow depth for 0% plant basal cover and increased with flow depth for plant basal cover greater than 1.25%. Thus a new equation for calculating Manning's n was developed based on plant basal cover and flow depth and was used in the Manning equation. The new flow velocity equation including plant basal cover provided satisfactory accuracy with a NSE of 0.995. The results indicate that the Manning's n was significantly affected by flow depth and plant basal cover.

ID WATER; MANAGEMENT; VULNERABILITY; LAKE
AB Due to the increasing need of human societies and diverse biological species for adequate and reliable water resources, river basins play an important role in reliable water supply. A comprehensive index for assessing the performance of river basins can prevent unintentional events by accurately identifying vulnerabilities and threats. In the present study, comprehensive risk assessment of a river basin is carried out using Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) to determine the undesirable events. The FTA method, based on a logical diagram, reveals the relationships of basic events and the top event by logical gates and is capable of providing quantitative and qualitative analysis of the river basin. It can show the failure paths and calculates the degree of basins' reliability. In this study, undesirable ecological status, low quality and scarcity of water resources, and economic and social anomalies were studied as unfavorable events of the Urmia Lake Basin. To do this, an FTA model is presented in which "Water Resources Failure Risk of Urmia Lake Basin" is the top event. The probability of occurrence of basic events and top event was calculated based on the information available for the area and using experts' opinions. The results of the study show that quality failure have the most impact on top event occurrence. The effective basic events in the occurrence of the top event are "Inappropriate governance", "low awareness level", "Entrance of industrial and domestic wastewater to groundwater", "Entrance of agricultural wastewater to groundwater", and "Meteorological drought", respectively. The index derived from the FTA can provide water resources managers and decision makers with comprehensive measure to improve and compare the status of internal and external effective factors in river basins.

AB The skin effect is an important issue associated with a loss of hydraulic efficiency in pumping systems. In this paper, a comprehensive study is conducted to determine how the evolution of the skin effect over time affects the productivity and functionality of brine exploitation systems in a crystalline halite aquifer. Several double-packer system tests have been interpreted via groundwater modeling to hydrogeologically characterize the investigated aquifer. A numerical groundwater flow model that accounts for the heterogeneity of the multilayer halite aquifer and the transient well skin effect on the brine exploitation system is presented to explain the continuous drawdown during three months of constant-rate brine extractions. Numerical results obtained suggested that an exponential decay function of permeability over time was required in a wellbore skin zone to reproduce numerically experimental observations during brine exploitation. The empirical exponential function obtained specifically for this case study was generalized, and coefficients considered were discussed to infer their physical and geochemical dimensions related to the mixing process triggering heterogenous reactions responsible for the hydraulic loses. Our results will be useful for predicting the spatial and temporal losses of hydraulic efficiency and for evaluating the lifetimes of brine exploitation infrastructure.

AB The aim of the study was the comparison of the soil hydraulic properties determined based on two different experimental methods of four large and macroporous soil samples. An undisturbed cylindrical soil column (h = 60 cm and d = 30 cm) was obtained at a natural slope and quartered horizontally in the laboratory. The four sub-samples were saturated and subsequently drained using the extended multi-step outflow method (XMSO). Retention curves and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves were derived via inverse modeling based on the measured drainage and corresponding pore water pressure. After resaturation the evaporation method (EVA) was used on the same four samples. The samples were exposed to evaporation and the effective water contents and the average pore water pressures were recorded over time to determine soil hydraulic functions.
   While both methods yielded similar results in the medium moisture range, the advantage of the XMSO-method is its higher information content with respect to the hydraulic conductivity close to water saturation whereas the advantage of the EVA-method is its fast execution. Moreover, the EVA-method is easier to handle and has significantly lower computational requirements than the XMSO-method.
   Furthermore, since the four soil samples represent a soil profile in the field, a depth dependent characterizing of the soil profile was possible and showed that the soil properties near saturation are greatly dominated by the ratio of macropores in the sample and that a decrease in the macropore ratio with soil depth was clearly reflected in the hydraulic functions.

AB Climate and land use change are the two primary factors that affect different components of hydrological cycle as well as sediment transport in the watershed. Quantifying potential impact of these two stressors enables decision makers to formulate better water resource management strategies to adapt to the changing environment. To that end, we have developed an integrated modeling framework employing an Agent-based approach to simulate land use conversion that then serves as input to the Soil and Water Assessment tool (SWAT) in a loosely coupled fashion. The modeling framework was tested on the Neshanic River Watershed (NRW), 142 km(2) area in central New Jersey that contains mix of urban, agricultural and forested lands. An ensemble of 10 different global climate models (GCMs) for two different greenhouse gas emission scenarios including representative concentration pathways-4.5 and 8.5 (RCP-4.5 and 8.5) were employed to model future climate from 2020 to 2045. Land use conversion for 2040 was developed based on six driving factors including distance to residential lands, agricultural lands, roads, streams, train stations, and forest using three land use transition potential models and further, the best transition potential model accompanied with some local land use restrictions.
   The study evaluated various components of hydrological cycle and sediment transport for the three different scenarios one-at-a-time including climate change alone, land use change alone, and combined climate and land use change. Results indicate that the changing climate will have a larger effect on the hydrologic cycle than intensifying urban land uses in the study watershed. The climate change scenarios, either alone or in composite with land use change, predict higher streamflow (32% and 36% increase over baseline, respectively), overriding the effect of land use change which predicts a decline of 5% in streamflow. The increase in streamflow results in an increase in sediment loading, presumably due to an increase stream downcutting. Conversely, the effect of land use change (in this case the conversion of agricultural land to low density residential uses), is predicted to decrease sediment load. When modelled in composite, the effect of changing land use (in this case the conversion of erodible agricultural fields to suburban development) appears to override the adverse effect of climate change, enhancing watershed resiliency by reducing sediment load and thereby improving health of the downstream aquatic ecosystems.

AB This study proposes a method for improving the capability of rainfall and flood forecasts by generating ensemble precipitation predictions (EPPs) associated with radar-based rainfall prediction by considering spatial rainfall errors. The EPPs are generated as a kind of Monte-Carlo simulation based on the performance of the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model in the previous time step window. The generated EPPs continue to be blended with radar-based rainfall predictions to produce hybrid rainfall forecasts that perform better than each system could perform individually. The hybrid forecasts are then adjusted by reducing the spatial rainfall errors, which have considerable contributions to the accuracy of the flood forecasts. To validate the performance of the proposed method, this method was applied to improve the capability of the coupled Local Data Assimilation and Prediction system (LDAPS) and Sejong University Rainfall - Runoff (SURR) model for rainfall and flood forecasts during two flood events that occurred in 2013 and 2016 in the Yeongwol watershed. EPPs were generated from the deterministic LDAPS rainfall events and were then blended with the McGill algorithm for precipitation nowcasting by Lagrangian extrapolation (MAPLE) rainfall predictions to produce hybrid rainfall forecasts. Each ensemble member of the hybrid model was then corrected before it was forced as an input for the SURR model to obtain ensemble streamflow predictions. The results showed that the capability of the coupled model was improved sustainably step by step and exhibited the best skills after applying the final step. For rainfall forecasts, the proportion correct (PC), root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (CC), and Brier score (BS) were improved dramatically by 59%, 32%, 32% and 48% for flood events in 2013 and by 39%, 15%, 33% and 37% for flood events in 2016, respectively. For flood forecasting, the Nash - Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and absolute relative error in volume (AREV) were improved substantially by 63% and 24% for flood events in 2013 and by 42% and 53% for flood events in 2016, respectively. The success of this case study proved the viability of the method proposed in this study.

AB Urban areas are often covered by materials with smooth ground surface and poor water permeability, which may cause problems such as increasing flow velocity and discharge.
   This study employed the diffusion wave equation to investigate the variation of overland flow, and analytical solutions were obtained by the generalized integral transformation technique. Examining previous research, we found when the coefficients in the diffusion wave equation were treated as constants, the simulated results would be mass non-conservative. This study corrected the coefficients which makes the flow meet the mass conservation law to improve the simulation results. An alternative solution to the overland flow considering time-varying rainfall and infiltration were proposed and the results were well compared with previous numerical solutions and experimental data.

AB A robust hydrological modeling at a fine spatial resolution is a vital tool for Norway to simulate river discharges and hydrological components for climate adaptation strategies. However, it requires improvements of modelling methods, detailed observational data as input and expensive computational resources. This work aims to set up a distributed version of the HBV model with a physically based evapotranspiration scheme at 1 km resolution for mainland Norway and to calibrate/validate the model for 124 catchments using regionalized parameterizations. The Penman-Monteith equation was implemented in the HBV model and vegetation characteristics were derived from the Norwegian forest inventory combined with multi-source remote sensing data at 16 m spatial resolution. The estimated potential evapotranspiration (Ep) was compared with pan measurements and estimates from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MOD16) products, the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) and Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model. There are 5 climatic zones in Norway classified based on 4 temperature and precipitation indices. For each zone, the model was calibrated separately by optimizing a multi-objective function including the Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (NSE) and biases of selected catchments. In total, there are 85 catchments for calibration and 39 for validation. The Ep estimates showed good agreement with the measurements, GLEAM and VIC outputs. However, the MOD16 product significantly overestimates Ep compared to the other products. The discharge was well reproduced with the median daily NSE of 0.68/0.67, bias of -3%/ -1%, Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.70/0.69 and monthly NSE of 0.80/0.78 in the calibration/validation periods. Our results showed a significant improvement compared to the previous HBV application for all catchments, with an increase of 0.08-0.16 in the median values of the daily NSE, KGE and monthly NSE. Both the temporal and spatial transferability of model parameterizations were also enhanced compared to the previous application.

AB The severity of river eutrophication is influenced by multiple stressors which reflect a wide-ranging variety of drivers encompassing land management, population growth and climatic effects. Experimental studies have successfully identified response to single or paired stressors under controlled conditions in small streams but have limited capability to characterise larger systems influenced by a wider variety of stressors. Here, a physics-based water quality model of the River Thames (UK) is used to explore the impacts of water temperature, phosphate concentration, river flow, urbanisation and riparian shading on indicators of chlorophyll and dissolved oxygen concentration by way of a sensitivity analysis. To understand the impact of model structural uncertainty, results are presented from two alternative formulations of the biological response. All outputs from each unique combination of stressors are presented in one graphic comprising multiple sub-plots that display the results of thousands of model runs simultaneously. Consequently, graphical analysis allows us to pinpoint under what circumstances reductions in key variables representing management-related stressors (i.e. lowering phosphorus concentrations and establishing riparian shading) may act synergistically, antagonistically or simply in an additive manner. Furthermore, we identify how these relationships may vary under different river flow and water temperature regimes and changes in abstraction and effluent discharge rates, to indicate the likely influence of future climate and population growth. Response can vary markedly depending on the choice of biological model and also changes considerably downstream along the river system. Chlorophyll indicators consistently show antagonistic responses to reduction in stressors whereas dissolved oxygen indicators show varied and complex responses. As expected, increases in phosphorus loading are detrimental, but so too are large decreases. Whilst the analysis suggests that urbanisation impacts are in general not expected to be large, changes in water demand brought about by population growth have disproportionate effects at low flows. These may result in increased incidence of very low dissolved oxygen concentrations which damage the health of the ecosystem.

AB Ecosystem protection requires a better definition of groundwater (GW) dependence and tools to measure this dependence. In this study, a classification method for the GW dependence of headwater streams was devised based on the fact that GW affects discharge, thermal regime, and water quality. The method was tested in three boreal headwater streams discharging from two esker aquifers. Spatial and temporal variability of GW dependence were studied in the stream continuum at several locations, by combining continuous measurements of temperature, electrical conductivity, and discharge with discrete sampling of environmental tracers (e.g., stable water isotopes, silica, chloride). The stream tracer index method developed was used to classify stream sections into GW-dominated, GW-surface water (SW) transition, and SW-dominated zones. We found that, spatially, GW dependence along the stream varied widely, with calculated stream tracer index values ranging from 33 to 94%. The GW-dominated areas extended at least 745, 1 682, and 4 202 m downstream from the main GW discharge points in the three streams studied. A stream located in a pristine peatland-dominated catchment was more prone to rapid change from GW- to SW-dominated than two streams located in catchments dominated by peatland forestry. These results suggest that to evaluate the GW dependence of streams, it may be sufficient to sample stream sections only once, during summer low-flow conditions. The proposed method can serve as a water management tool, especially for streams of exceptional ecological importance or in places where anthropogenic activities are expected to change local hydrology and ecology.

AB An exact analytical solution for one-dimensional fluid flow through rock matrix block is presented. The non linearity induced from flow functions makes the governing equations describing this mechanism difficult to be analytically solved. In this paper, an analytical solution to the infiltration problems considering non-linear relative permeability functions is presented for finite depth, despite its profound and fundamental importance. Elimination of the nonlinear terms in the equation, as a complex and tedious task, is done by applying several successive mathematical manipulations including: Hopf-Cole transformation to obtain a diffusive type PDE; an exponential type transformation to get a convective-diffusive type PDE with suitable boundary conditions; Laplace transformation; Integral transformation to homogenize the boundary condition in the Laplace domain; and finally Laplace inversion method to find the time domain solution. The obtained solution is used for developing a new matrix-fracture transfer function. The developed analytical equations are used for prediction of drying front in the case of evaporation from deep water table. The model results are in close agreement with the experimental data and numerical simulation of the process. Results of sensitivity analysis of different parameters on recovery rate and ultimate production based on design of experiment method are also discussed.

AB A reservoir operation chart is effective in guiding the actual operation of reservoirs. With the development and construction of large-scale mixed reservoirs, operating reservoirs using multiple objective operations has become a hot issue. This study, therefore, improved and expanded the traditional energy storage operation chart (ESOC) model for pure cascade reservoirs based to the special relationships between hydraulics and water volume of the upstream and downstream reservoirs in a mixed reservoir system. Considering the objectives of flood control, energy generation (including power generation, guaranteed output, and assurance rate), and ecological flow, a multi-objective ESOC optimization model for large-scale mixed reservoirs is established, and the corresponding solving method for this model is proposed. Taking the Pearl river basin of China as an example, the multi objective Pareto fronts of different minimum discharges of upstream reservoirs are obtained. According to the actual operation demands and constraints, the optimal multi-objective schemes under different assurance rates and different ecological flow satisfaction rates are extracted based on the obtained Pareto fronts. For example, if the assurance rate of power generation is required to be equal to or greater than 90% and the ecological flow, the satisfaction rate of downstream control sections is required to be equal to or greater than 0.97, the scheme is the best when the minimum discharge of upstream reservoirs is 300 m(3)/s, and the corresponding power generation and guaranteed output are 58.989 x 10(8) kWh and 439 GW, respectively. On the whole, the proposed models and related results have significance for the actual operation of large-scale mixed reservoirs.

ID SIMULATION-OPTIMIZATION APPROACH; RELEASE HISTORY; DISPERSION; AQUIFERS
AB A new solute transport inverse method is proposed for estimating plume trajectory and source release location under unknown solute transport boundary conditions in a steady-state, non-uniform groundwater flow field. Solute concentration is modeled by proposing a set of local approximation solutions (LAS) of transport that are discretized over the problem domain. At a given time step, the inverse method imposes continuities of concentration and total solute mass flux at a set of collocation points in the inversion grid, whereas the LAS are conditioned to measured breakthrough concentrations. By enforcing transport physics at selected points in space and time, the inverse problem becomes well-posed and a single system of inversion equations is assembled and solved with a parallel iterative solver. Unlike most of the inversion techniques that minimize a model-data mismatch objective function, the inverse method does not require the simulation of a forward transport model for optimization, thus both solute initial and boundary conditions can be recovered. Assuming dispersivity estimates are available, the method was demonstrated using synthetic breakthrough data from various sampling densities and designs, i.e., irregular versus uniformly spaced well networks. Different measurement errors and source release histories (e.g., uniform-in-time, single, and multiple pulses) were also investigated. Results suggest that for the source release histories tested, 1) inversion is stable under increasing measurement errors up to 5% of the maximum observed concentration; 2) accurate plume trajectory and source release location can be estimated from solute breakthrough concentrations; 3) inversion accuracy appears the most sensitive to sampling well density and its information content.

AB Water-sediment regulation (WSR) is an effective non-engineering measure to alleviate the problem of suspended river and bring benefit to flood control security in sediment-laden river. However, WSR may decrease the socioeconomic benefit of reservoirs, for example, reduction of hydropower production and water supply. In order to satisfy the practical requirement of WSR and other utilization objectives, this paper presents a multi-objective operation model for a cascade reservoirs simultaneously considering the maximization water volume for WSR and power generation and water supply, as well as various complex constraints. Then, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) is improved to solve the aforementioned model and key control indicators of WSR are analyzed. Meanwhile, a sediment transport model has been introduced to quantify the effect of WSR. The models are applied to the cascade reservoirs in the Upper Yellow River. The following conclusion can be drawn from results (1) Pareto fronts of the model solution demonstrate a strong competition between WSR and water supply, water supply and power generation, a low sensitivity between WSR and power generation; (2) the ability of WSR in Upper Yellow River is 6 times in 24 years, which means the frequency of WSR is four years averagely; (3) 233.77 million tons of sediments are transported by long-term WSR in the Ningxia-Inner Mongolia reaches, account for 19.10% of sediment deposition; (4) the risk-free conditions of LYX and LJX reservoirs' water volume for WSR are 137.42 x 10(8) m(8) and 41.08 x 10(8) m(8), respectively, which could be used as a reference in actual operation. The research results have an important practical significance and application for sediment control and governance of suspended river, and the multi-objective operation model of WSR proposed in this study can be effectively and suitably used in sediment regulation with similar conditions.

AB This study describes immiscible fluid displacement near a transitional boundary at which inertial effect occurs. We simulated two-phase fluid flow in a 2D micromodel using the lattice Boltzmann method with varying Reynolds numbers (Re) (log Re = -2 to 2) and viscosity ratios (M) (log M = -2 to 0). To highlight the role of inertial force rather than capillary and viscous forces, the capillary number (Ca) was kept constant at log Ca = -5. As Re and M increased, development in the preferential flow became more pronounced with tortuous paths. We found the transitional boundary exists near log Re = -1 to 1 at which residual saturation of the displaced fluid starts to fluctuate and changes 5%-14% in the transitional regime. In particular, this boundary describes the effect of inertia on immiscible fluid displacement before an increase in the work done due to inertial force occurs.

AB Atmospheric and streamflow drought back to 1600 were reconstructed with provenance-verified regional Pinus-sylvestris and Pinus-nigra chronologies of earlywood, latewood and ring width, detrended by signal-free regional curve standardization, from the Weinviertel, a dry region in Eastern Austria. Linear regression models with Weinviertel latewood indices as predictor variables were used to estimate regional April August precipitation totals (R-2 = 0.47) and seven-day minimum flow from May to October (best fit: R-2 = 0.65). As a novelty, the well-known dendrochronology quality measure "Expressed Population Signal" in a modified version is used to define a scaling factor for empirically estimating the reconstructions' time-varying reliability.
   For the detection of drought years in the reconstructed time series, four stages of drought of increasing intensity were defined as conditions below median, and below the 33rd, 20th, and 5th percentile-representing 2-year, 3-year, 5-year and 20-year recurrence intervals.
   The method for the extension of time series of low flows into the past is applicable in the Weinviertel and can be a useful source of historical hydrological and meteorological information restricted by the uncertainties coming along with proxy records. Of the analyzed period back to 1600, the 19th century is the driest one closely followed by the 18th century, sharing the overall driest period from 1775 to 1813. The phase with the longest continuous atmospheric dry period is 1807-1811. The longest hydrological drought lasted from 1832 to 1839.

AB Situational awareness in sanitary sewer systems requires accurate flow information at different spatial locations in a city. It is especially desirable to predict flows across a wastewater network in response to heavy rainfall events in addition to regular consumption patterns. Typically, complicated hydraulic models that suffer from difficulties in parameter identification and high computational burden are used for flow prediction. Recently, data-driven approaches have been employed for flow prediction. In this paper, we first design and then compare the performance of three data-driven methods to predict flow: (1) Artificial Neural Network (ANN); (2) Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM); (3) Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). We test the performance of these machine and statistical learning techniques using data gathered from the City of Springfield. While, all three data-driven methodologies provide acceptable prediction performance, we observe that LSTM outperforms ANN due to the inherent memory integrated with a feedback structure. The statistical learning approach, i.e., LASSO regression not only offers good prediction performance, but also helps identify the key spatial and temporal features that influence flow at any specific location. This added information could aid in remediation activities. Another key contribution of this paper is that we quantify the value of groundwater data in flow prediction. Specifically, including groundwater data as an additional input enhances flow prediction performance in all three methods. Lastly, to better predict flows corresponding to rare events (e.g., 50 or 100 year rainfall events) we use a resampling approach (known as SmoteR) to modify the training dataset. Simulation results indicate that the resampling technique is effective in improving prediction performance.

AB In this study, we proposed a hybrid approach combining the standard FAO-56 method with the complementary principle of evapotranspiration (ET) to predict actual ET (ETa) on a rainfed crop field. A generalized complementary relationship (GCR) was employed to quantify the water stress coefficient (K-s) for the FAO-56 method with no use of soil moisture data. Then, the K-s values were multiplied to the crop ET (ETc) estimated with the corrected air temperatures for the assumption of adequate land-surface moisture. The proposed hybrid method applied to a rotational maize-soybean field where an eddy-covariance flux tower was installed. Results showed that the reference ET (ETo) estimated by the corrected temperatures was within a range of 89-95% of that from non-corrected ones, implying that ETo could be inflated when using the mean air temperatures measured under sub-humid conditions. The K-s values estimated by GCR showed consistent patterns with temporal rainfall variation on the field. The multiplication of the K-s from GCR and ETc showed higher performance in ETa prediction than when the GCR was solely applied. By inverting the hybrid approach, a local crop coefficient curve for the rainfed maize field was developed, and led to further improvement in ETa prediction. This study suggests that combination of the complementary principle and the FAO-standard method, which are seemingly in separate paradigms, may improve ETa prediction on crop fields.

AB This study introduces a novel hydrological assessment tool (HAT) based on hybrid machine learning (HML) framework. The HML framework combines an unsupervised clustering technique and a supervised classification technique, to determine reasonable performance ratings (unsatisfactory, satisfactory, good, and very good) and build a practical assessment tool. Hydrologically significant error indices are used to cluster the performance rating groups and train the HAT. The HAT was applied to the National Water Model (NWM), which is operated in real time for the continental United States (CONUS). For establishing, training, and validating the HAT, data from October 2013 to February 2017 were used, and a performance assessment was conducted on the NWM in the San Francisco Bay Area. As a result, the HAT determined the performance ratings that were reliable in terms of the statistics and hydrograph. It was confirmed that the HAT could perform an accurate hydrograph assessment as the concordance rate of the performance ratings was 98%. The NWM was evaluated against 57 USGS streamflow gauges using the HAT and was found to perform with 46% on average, good and very good ratings. The HML framework, an integral part of the HAT, is expected to be useful not only in hydrological analysis but also across all geophysical fields that deal with physical processes.

AB Little is known about the contribution of bedload flux to the total sediment load exported from tropical sand-bed rivers. Yet, predicting bedload transport rates contributes to better river management, more appropriate river engineering works design, accurate knowledge of sediment delivery rates, which greatly benefits sediment related water resources management. Therefore, bedload, suspended load and runoff discharge were measured at the lower Gilgel Abay River in the Blue Nile catchment of Ethiopia. Catchment area is 3887 km(2), average stream discharge in the rainy season 315 (+/- 164) m(3) s(-1), and the stream surface gradient at the sampling station 0.0007 m m(-1). A standard Helley-Smith (U.S. BL-84) cable-suspended sampler was used to take 315 samples to measure bedload fluxes for the 2017 rainy season. The bedload predominantly comprises well to moderately well sorted, medium-sized sand (250-500 mu m) with a symmetric and leptokurtic distribution. The mean daily observed bedload discharge varies from 0.7 to 427.5 Mg d(-1) with an average rate of 175.1 Mg d(-1). Field observations also show that the bedload dynamics become larger near the river banks and decrease towards the middle of the river section due to the presence of a central bridge pier. The average suspended sediment load ranges from 247 to 220,028 Mg d(-1) and dominates the total sediment yield ( > 94.6%). The bedload accounts for only 0.1 to 5.4% of the total sediment load. The area-specific bedload and suspended load are also 0.6 and 22 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) respectively. The elongated planform growth of the Gilgel Abay River delta in Lake Tana is also in line with the predominance of very fine, suspended load in the sediment transport of this river, in addition to limited alongshore drifting given the low waves of Tana lake. Among the tested bedload prediction criteria, the stream-power based equations of Martin and modified Bagnold performed better. Yet, the bedload prediction performance of simple power regression equations based on runoff discharge and excess unit stream power parameters provided the best agreement with the observed bedload data (Adj. R-2 0.82-0.87). Finally, this study provides plausible estimates of bedload fluxes that are within predicted ranges reported for sand-bed rivers in Africa and other tropical regions.

AB Rapid economic development and population growth in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin makes it imperative for water resources to be used fairly and efficiently among all stakeholders. This paper proposes an integrated model framework to assess the water benefits sharing schemes among the five stakeholders in the basin, namely, China, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Three objectives are considered for this assessment-hydropower (HP), eco-index (EI), and agricultural water use (AW). The hydrologic model, optimization model, and cooperative game theory methods are jointly used to analyze the water benefits of stakeholders under different scenarios. According to the model, cooperation can bring more incremental benefits in dry years when water resources are scarce. Three cooperative game theoretical methods, namely, the Shapley value, the Gately point, and the Nash-Harsanyi solution, are employed to find the possible benefit sharing solutions. The results show that China and Laos need to operate their reservoirs for downstream countries' beneficial uses under cooperation, and thus, compensation by reallocating the incremental benefit from cooperation is necessary no matter which method is used. It is found that all of the future damming plans would enhance the basin-level cooperation in most cases. In particular, according to the analysis, damming in the basins of the Sesan, Srepok, and Sekong rivers would have more effect than damming in the upper Lancang-Mekong River Basin after 2030. Based on some verified assumptions, the results of this paper can offer real-world preferences, but the uncertainties need to be further explored.

AB Streamflow scenario tree reduction is essential for alleviating the computational burden of a stochastic programming with recourse model. This paper develops a new streamflow scenario tree reduction method aimed at preserving important statistical moment information and maintaining streamflow scenario probability. Specifically, we first employ a neural gas algorithm for scenario tree generation, then establish a stepwise conditional Monte Carlo sampling method for systemically reducing the number of scenarios from the full tree. We then develop a regularized optimization model based on ridge regression and moment matching to determine the posterior scenario probability. We apply the proposed method to the Qingjiang cascade reservoir system in China. The results show that the reduced tree with 35% reduction level can still maintain robust moment preservations, including the mean, variance, lag-one covariance, cross-site covariance, and scenario probability. Additionally, the stability test indicates that the proposed conditional Monte Carlo sampling method is stable and converges within a reasonable number of scenario combinations.

AB Single-well push-pull (SWPP) test is one of the most important ways to estimate flow and transport parameters, e.g. porosity, dispersivity, regional groundwater flow velocity. Usually the wellbore is surrounded by a finite-thickness skin, such as a gravel pack. The positive skin has a smaller hydraulic conductivity than the aquifer formation zone, and the negative skin has a greater one. In this study, a numerical model of a SWPP test considering skin effects was established using the finite-element COMSOL Multiphysics program to estimate aquifer parameters. Several important results were obtained. Firstly, regional groundwater velocity affects the types of breakthrough curves (BTCs) through changing the flow pattern. Secondly, a positive (or negative) skin leads to a slower (or faster) tracer transport process, and a smaller ratio between the hydraulic conductivity of the skin and that of the aquifer formation zone results in greater solute plume retardation in the skin zone. Thirdly, a larger thickness of the positive skin leads to a higher tracer concentration around the well, and the opposite is true if the skin is negative. Besides, the model of Leap and Kaplan (1988) underestimates the regional groundwater velocity for the second type of BTCs, and a larger longitudinal dispersivity can lead to a greater error, where the second type of BTCs has a rising limb at early stage followed by a falling limb at late stage. The general conclusion is that the estimations of groundwater velocity from SWPP tests are also affected by skin effects.

AB This study employed SWMM for simulations to elucidate physical mechanisms of LID components in site, as well as coupled Genetic Algorithm with hydrological simulation to determine the optimal spatial configuration of LIDs in a watershed. Using main campus of NTU as a case study, the results shows that the effectiveness of LID depends on storage capacity in delaying and attenuating discharge prior to the onset of peak inflow. With enough surcharge storage control the discharge at the beginning of the rising limb, the benefits of the LID s increased with the rainfall recurrence intervals. A reversal of effect of peak reduction is observed when the surface storage space has been exhausted. At the watershed scale, the optimization results revealed that a higher ratio of LID installations in midstream subcatchments than in upstream and in downstream subcatchments. Hydrograph analysis also explained that installing LID facilities in subcatchments that make their primary contribution to outflow roughly simultaneously with the onset of peak flow is preferable in reducing peak flow at a watershed outlet. The finding of this study could be useful to formulate watershed guidelines or strategies for the installation of decentralized flood reduction facilities.

AB The local approximation prediction model (LPM) is a forecasting approach based on chaos theory. It uses the Euclidean distance to evaluate the spatial proximity between two phase points, which is a measure of "quantity" similarity. This study improved LPM by proposing a coupled "quantity-pattern" similarity model (CQPSM). The "pattern" similarity is defined as the similarity of two phase points on internal structure, and measured by a cumulative unit-step function. The forbearing stratified sequencing method is employed to solve the double objective optimization problem. The proposed model was tested using the data from the Danjiangkou reservoir basin for future 12-monthly precipitation forecasting with lead times from a month to a year. Four performance measures (R, RMSE, MARE and NSE) were computed and compared to those of LPM and autoregressive (AR) model. The results show a better performance of CQPSM and indicates the importance of considering "pattern" similarity between two phase points. Moreover, the weighted Euclidean distance based on partial information logic was discussed and applied to further improve the "quantity" similarity. Consequently, the proposed CQPSM could provide a new alternative for hydrological forecasting.

AB High arsenic concentrations (average 0.1 mg/L) of groundwater were found in Lanyang plain of Taiwan. In this study, 39 groundwater samples from 23 wells were collected and 14 hydro-geochemical parameters were analyzed. Factor analysis was applied to determine major influence factors of the arsenic enriched groundwater quality, and PHREEQC was used to calculate the distribution of aqueous species and saturation index of which affected the hydrogeochemistry of groundwater. 393 geological core samples from 9 drilling wells were collected and analyzed the contents of total arsenic and iron. Moreover, core samples associated with high arsenic concentration groundwater were selected, mineralogical phases were analyzed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), high resolution X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS). Results of the arsenic enrichment factor determined by factor analysis indicated that infiltration of the organic and nitrogen pollutants from anthropogenic activities to shallow groundwater, and the reductive dissolution from iron oxyhydroxides in the deep aquifer were the main processes of arsenic release to groundwater from the sediment. Total arsenic and iron contents of the core samples were well correlated in marine sequences. The presence of clay layer within the subsurface may increase in the As contamination in groundwater aquifer. However the time for As release from clay layer to lower aquifer may require tens or hundreds years to complete under natural environment condition. Surface analyses of core sample performed by XPS showed that arsenic was adsorbed or co-precipitated with non-crystalline iron oxyhdroxides and sulfides. After a long term burial of sediment, microbial metabolism of organic matter creates a more reducing environment, arsenic may then be gradually released from iron oxyhydroxides by reductive dissolution or desorption to aqueous phase. The framboidal-diagenetic type phase was identified by XPS and the groundwater is supersaturated with respect to pyrite and orpiment determined by PHREEQC are suggesting sulfide minerals co precipitate As. Arsenic in sediments is released into groundwater primarily by the reductive dissolution of As-bearing Fe-oxyhydroxides in reducing environment in the Lanyang plain.

AB Agricultural conservation practices, or agricultural best management practices (BMPs), can reduce nutrient loading and help address harmful algal blooms (HABs). HABs in the western basin of Lake Erie, which are largely caused by phosphorus losses from the Maumee River watershed, are critical in the recent years. In this study, a new BMP cost tool was developed. Then the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the new BMP cost tool were integrated to explore efficiencies and cost-effectiveness of BMPs in an agricultural catchment of the Maumee River watershed with various scenarios. The scenarios included individual BMPs applied in 100% of suitable areas, individual BMPs targeting Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus (DRP) and Total Phosphorus (TP) critical areas, and BMPs implemented in series. In addition, a cost-effective approach for the selections and placements of BMPs in agricultural watersheds was developed as an alternative to running complex optimization tools that are not applicable to large watersheds. The cost-effective approach applied BMPs based on cost-effectiveness rankings starting from the most cost-effective one. Results showed that: (1) BMPs implemented in series, which reduced pollutant loads more than individual BMPs, were not as cost-effective as some individual BMPs; (2) among all scenarios, filter strips targeting DRP/TP critical areas were the most cost-effective in reducing yearly/spring DRP/TP losses; (3) to obtain the watershed management plan goal of reducing March-July DRP/TP losses by 40%, implementing BMPs one by one in critical areas based on the cost-effectiveness rankings of individual BMPs in DRP/TP critical areas was the most cost-effective; and (4) the simulation results, modeling tools, and cost-effective approach can help create agricultural BMP strategies to cost-efficiently improve water quality.

AB Interception loss can remove a significant portion of rainwater from forested ecosystems. Therefore, the quantification and modelling of interception loss are of significant importance if human and ecosystem water demands are to be balanced under a future changing climate. This is particularly true for semi-arid/arid regions, where afforestation has become an important ecological restoration measure to tackle desertification, poverty and climate change. However, quantification and modelling of interception loss of plantations in these regions have rarely been reported. In the present study, rainfall interception loss was quantified and modelled over a one-year period (January-December 2016) for a deciduous broad-leafed R. pseudoacacia plantation and an evergreen needle-leaf P. tabuliformis plantation (common afforestation tree species) situated in the semi-arid Loess Plateau of China. The stand age, density, canopy cover and leaf area index of R. pseudoacacia during the study period were 15 years, 2000 tree ha(-1), 0.48 and 1.41 m(2) m(-2), respectively. The corresponding values for Pinus tabuliformis were 17 years, 1200 tree ha(-1), 0.62 and 2.53 m(2) m(-2). The measured throughfall, stemflow and derived estimates of interception loss for R pseudoacacia were 81.1%, 1.3% and 17.6%, respectively. The corresponding values for P. tabuliformis were 75.4%, 0.7% and 23.9%. Given that the weather conditions experienced by the two forest stands were similar, the observed higher interception loss for P. tabuliformis can be explained by the higher canopy storage capacity and wet canopy evaporation rate of this species. The revised Gash analytical model of rainfall interception was well calibrated and validated against field measurements and was able to simulate the cumulative interception loss at two forest stands accurately, and it also effectively captured the seasonal variation (leafed growing and leafless dormant seasons), provided that the optimized wet canopy evaporation rates were used. The revised model was highly sensitive to the canopy storage capacity and changes in the ratio of mean wet canopy evaporation to mean rainfall intensity and less sensitive to canopy cover, but it was found to be fairly insensitive to the trunk storage capacity.

AB This work is concerned with the intricate interplay between node or pore pressures and connection or throat conductivities in flow or pore networks. A setting similar to pore networks is given by fracture networks. Recently, a non-local generalization of Darcy's law for flow and transport in porous media was presented in the context of unbounded or periodic pore networks. In this work, we first outline a robust method for the extraction of the hydraulic conductivity distribution, which is at the heart of the non-local Darcy formulation. Second, a theory for mean pressure and flow in bounded networks is outlined. Predictions of that theory are validated against numerical network results and it is demonstrated that the theory works well for networks with high connectivity involving pores with high coordination numbers. For other networks, improvements to the outlined theory are proposed and their accuracy is assessed.

AB Vegetation can effectively prevent soil loss and play an important role in soil and water conservation. Accurate estimation of hydraulic parameters is critical for soil erosion models. Hydraulic data for different levels of vegetation stem cover, slope gradient and flow discharge are quite limited. The objectives of this study were to compare different measured methods of flow velocity, evaluate the influence of vegetation stem cover, slope gradient and discharge on hydraulic parameters and predict the shear stress (tau), stream power (Omega) and unit stream power (omega) and emphasize the significance of hydraulic radius in the calculation of the shear stress (tau), stream power (Omega), and unit stream power (omega). A non-erodible flume bed was used in this study. The discharge ranged from 0.5 x 10(-3) to 2.0 x 10(-3) m(3) s(-1), the slope gradient ranged from 8.8% to 25.9%, and an artificial stem cover of approximately 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30% was used to represent the natural vegetation. The stems were 2 mm in diameter and randomly arranged. The electrolyte pulse method was preferred for measurement of the overland flow velocity. The flow velocity decreased as the stem cover increased, and flow discharge and slope gradient decreased. The reduction in flow velocity was as high as 90% for 30% stem cover based on the experiments. The flow depth increased as the stem cover and flow discharge increased as the slope gradient decreased. The Reynolds and Froude number values decreased with increasing stem cover. The shear stress, stream power and unit stream power were all significantly affected by the stem cover and could all broadly be described using an exponential delay function of the stem cover. The omega was no significantly impacted by hydraulic radius. Thus, the unit stream power is an improved hydraulic parameter for predicting sediment transport capacity.

AB Existence of preferential flow paths (PFP) in heterogeneous aquifers may dramatically change the behavior of aquifers, making it critical to recognize PFP in solute transport simulation and environmental risk analysis. Conventional particle tracking method can recognize PFP but is computationally demanding and hardly applicable in real high-dimensional problems. Minimum resistance method based on graph theory, though efficient, is unable to consider flow conditions and may lead to implausible path results. In this paper we propose an easy-to-implement method based on stream function to analyze and recognize PFP in heterogeneity of multiple levels. Illustrative examples and robustness tests are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the stream function-based method compared with particle tracking and minimum resistance methods. It is found that the proposed method is able to avoid high computational demand and potential conflicts with hydrodynamic conditions thus is both efficient and reliable.

AB In this study, different Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques including Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN), Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Support Vector Regression (SVR), empirical models including Hargreaves and Samani (HS), Modified Hargreaves and Samani (MHS), Makkink (MK), Ritchie (RT) and conventional Multilinear Regression (MLR), were employed to model Reference Evapotranspiration (ET0) in fourteen stations from several climatic regions in Turkey, Cyprus, Iraq, Iran and Libya. For this purpose, 12 parameters of monthly climate data were collected and used as input parameters to the models. The parameters were subjected to quality assurance tests to ensure their validity and acceptability. The study was conducted in three sections: (i) Sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the dominant inputs. (ii) Single models were trained and their performances were accessed on the basis of ET0 derived from pan evaporation method. (iii) Finally, three ensemble methods of simple averaging, weighted averaging and neural ensemble were applied in strategy 1 (for AI models) and strategy 2 (for empirical models) to improve the predicting performance. The results revealed that depending on the climate of the regions, pan evaporation, solar radiation, temperatures and surface pressure are the most dominant parameters, empirical and MLR models could be employed to achieve the valuable results, AI based models are superior in performance to the other models, also promising improvement in ET0 modeling could be achieved by ensemble modeling. The results of this study affirmed that the provided ensemble approaches can increase the performance of single models in the verification phase up to 22%, for strategy 1 and 55%, for strategy 2. Also, the results demonstrated that AI based ensemble modeling is preferable to empirical ensemble modeling.

AB The author read with much interest the publication by Mize et al (2018) on the decrease in suspended-sediment concentrations and loads in the lower Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers between 1980 and 2015. Researchers interested in sediment dynamics in the lower Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers also should be aware that sediment data previously reported for the lower Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) were affected by a systematic error in the fines fraction (particle sizes less than 0.063 millimeter) of the suspended-sediment concentration. This error affected results reported from October 1973 through February 2015 for two sites on the main stem of the Mississippi River, three sites on the Atchafalaya River, one site on the Old River Outflow Channel, and one site on the Red River. The USGS and USACE identified the error and have revised the results for samples collected from October 1989 through February 2015, as reported by Norton et al. (2019a) and Norton et al. (2019b). The significant conclusions of Mize et al. (2018) and sediment loads modeled using the Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) method were unaffected by the systematic error because the models used data from unaffected sites; however, the background information provided in tables 1 and 2 of Mize et al. (2018) included references to several previous studies that contained results affected by the error. This comment paper identifies which references in Mize et al. (2018) were affected by the error and alerts readers to implications of the data revision.

AB Hydrological processes became non-stationary under the influences of climate change and human activities. This non-stationarity highlights the need to adopt time-varying parameters in hydrological models. The majority of existing literature quantifies time-varying parameters by incorporating real observations of single basin into a hydrological model. They are limited in their information on catchment characteristics and climatic factors to constrain time-varying parameters. Thus, models are difficult to apply for hydrological predictions outside the calibration periods. This paper formulated the time-varying parameters for a lumped hydrological model as explicit functions of physically-based covariates that captured the catchment characteristics. Then, it used a hierarchical Bayesian framework to incorporate the similarity of adjacent basins to reduce the uncertainty of the assumed functions for time-varying parameters. Four modeling scenarios were developed to explore the spatial coherence between different characteristics of adjacent basins. Five criteria were adopted to evaluate the performance of assumed functional forms. Four spatially adjacent catchments in the central United States were selected as case studies to examine the validity of the proposed method. Results showed that (1) the proposed method succeeded in reducing the uncertainty of time-varying parameters, and (2) the seasonality of the catchment storage was more coherent between adjacent basins, indicated by the largest increase in model prediction performance (i.e., 9%). This study improved the understanding of the spatial coherence of time varying parameters, which helps improve hydrological predictions in the future.

TI Coupling hydrodynamic, geochemical and isotopic approaches to evaluate
   oxbow connection degree to the main stream and to adjunct alluvial
   aquifer

AB Wetlands as oxbows play a fundamental socio-economic and environmental role. They behave as efficient tools in regards to hydrological and ecological concerns: they contribute to control rivers discharge (flood prevention and contribution to drought flow) as well as to manage water quality (excess nutrients retention) and they constitute refuge habitats for flora and fauna. They may so become more and more determinant as nature-based solutions in a near future. However, the establishment of complete and reliable functioning models is complicated by the different connection degrees that can present these specific wetlands to the main stream and to the adjunct alluvial aquifer. Moreover, monodisciplinary approaches usually conducted can underestimate or even neglect sources of water supply. The present study offers a multidisciplinary approach coupling hydrodynamic (surface water/groundwater levels), geochemical (T, EC, pH, major ions) and isotopic (delta H-2-delta O-18) characterization in order to properly assess the dynamic of these specific hydrosystems and so be able to establish a complete and reliable hydrodynamic conceptual model. The coupling approach has been tested on the Auzon Oxbow, one of the fluvial annexes of the Allier River (Massif Central, France). The resulting conceptual model testifies for connection degree higher that expected between the oxbow and both the main stream and alluvial aquifer. Indeed, a non-negligible supply of the oxbow by the alluvial groundwater is observed, especially in its downstream part. As this part of the oxbow is the site of its confluence to the Allier River, groundwater supply could have been underestimated. The geochemical approach shows that Allier River also supply the oxbow through the upstream paleochannel, result of a channel migration 30 years ago. Hydrodynamic and isotopic approaches complete the understanding showing that the paleochannel pathway is only active during high flow periods (from November to June). Based on these results, the strategic utility of the proposed approach to study oxbow's hydrosystems has been proved.

AB The potential effect of climate change needs to be considered in urban infrastructure design and risk assessment to improve reliability. The present study proposes a methodology for obtaining grid-scale relative changes for updating 24-h extreme rainfall intensity, through the estimation of rainfall intensity quantiles from baseline and future simulations using a pooled frequency analysis approach. Coherence of relative changes over return periods and time horizons is analysed, and adjustments are proposed to facilitate the application of relative changes in practice. The approach is applied to Canada, using gridded daily precipitation series from model combinations belonging to the North American Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment. Multi model 10th, 50th and 90th percentile relative changes are provided for six return periods, considering two future scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), and two horizons (2050 and 2080). Overall, estimated relative changes varied smoothly and formed a number of clusters of similar values across the country. Relative changes for RCP 8.5 are recommended for 2050, whereas either those for RCP 4.5 or RCP 8.5 could be used for 2080. As an example, median multi-model 50th percentile relative change over Canada is found to be 14%, 16% and 27% for RCP 4.5 - 2080, RCP 8.5 - 2050, and RCP 8.5 - 2080, respectively.

AB In the framework of a natural CO2 reservoir with CO2 leakages as an analogue of a failed CO2 deep geological storage, the current precipitation of travertines and the associated upwelling of CO2-rich saline groundwater were analysed. This natural analogue is located in the Ganuelas-Mazarron Tertiary Basin (SE Spain). The study comprises of the chemistry of both groundwater and travertines, including stable isotopes, mineralogy and petrography of the travertines, all this performed after a review of the geology of the basin. In this sense, the basin gathers the main features of a safe natural CO2 reservoir in a deep saline aquifer sealed by a thick marl formation. The aquifer was artificially perturbed by the drilling of wells, inducing the travertines precipitation at these water discharge points. Groundwater is saline, slightly acid, oversaturated in aragonite and calcite and with significant concentrations of heavy elements, some of them toxic. From an isotopic viewpoint, the relative constant delta C-13-DIC values suggest that carbon is mainly inorganic in origin with minor organic and mantle contributions. Travertines are basically composed of aragonite or calcite, their precipitation being controlled by a sudden CO2 degassing and minor biological activity. Their delta C-13 signatures indicate that carbon mainly has an inorganic origin, although some contribution of organic carbon must be considered as well. Furthermore, these carbonate deposits did not precipitate in isotopic equilibrium, as determined by delta O-18 values. Finally, it is suggested that the appearance of travertines along with their carbon isotopic signatures represent efficient tools for detecting CO2 leakages from any CO2 storage site.

AB Concentrations of uranium (U) > 30 mu g/L in groundwater are relatively uncommon in drinking water in the United States but can be of concern in those areas where complex interactions of aquifer materials and anthropogenic alterations of the natural flow regime mobilize U. High concentrations (> 30 mu g/L) of U in the southeastern San Joaquin Valley, California, USA, have been detected in 24 percent of 257 domestic, irrigation, and public-supply wells sampled across an approximately 110,000 km(2) area. In this study we evaluated mechanisms for mobilization of U in the San Joaquin Valley proposed in previous studies, confirming mobilization by HCO3 and refuting mobilization by NO3 and we refined our understanding of the geologic sources of U to the scale of individual alluvial fans. The location of high concentrations depends on the interactions of geological U sources from fluvial fans that originate in the Sierra Nevada to the east and seepage of irrigation water that contains high concentrations of HCO3 that leaches U from the sediments. In addition, interactions with PO4 from fertilized irrigated fields may sequester U in the aquifer. Principal component analysis of the data demonstrates that HCO3 and ions associated with high total dissolved solids in the aquifer and the percentage of agriculture near the well sampled are associated with high U concentrations. Nitrate concentrations do not appear to control release of U to the aquifer. Age dating of the groundwater and generally increasing U concentrations of the past 25 years in resampled wells where irrigation is prevalent suggests that high U concentrations are associated with younger water, indicating that irrigation of fields over the past 100 years has significantly contributed to increasing concentrations and mobilizing U. In some places, the groundwater is supersaturated with uranyl-containing minerals, as would be expected in roll front deposits. In general, the interaction of natural geological sources high in U, the anthropogenically driven addition of HCO3 and possibly phosphate fertilizer, control the location and concentration of U in each individual fluvial fan, but the addition of nitrate in fertilizer does not appear control the location of high U. These geochemical interactions are complex but can be used to determine controls on anomalously high U in alluvial aquifers.

   AUSTRALIA; RESPONSES; SALINITY
AB Restoration of water quality in deforested watersheds is a major environmental and economic challenge in many parts of the world. In south-western Australia water quality issues manifest as salinisation, where reactivation of groundwater systems has occurred post-deforestation with the consequent discharge of salts stored in deep regolith into rivers. Prior to deforestation the stream salinity of the Denmark River (a forested watershed of 502 km(2)) was between 150 and 350 mg L-1TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) and was developed as a small water supply with potential for a much larger development. By the 1970s, 20% of deep rooted vegetation in the watershed was removed resulting in annual flow-weighted stream salinity of 1500 mg L-1TDS making the river unsuitable as a water supply. Two main policy approaches were used to restore this watershed: (1) the control of further deforestation on private land through regulation; and (2) a program to encourage private reforestation with eucalypt pulp-wood plantations. By 2010, 143% of the watershed was reforested leaving only 5.5% still deforested, with a strong relationship between streamflow and stream salinity and the amount of reforestation. River salinity had fallen to 500 mg L-1 TDS by 2017. Although streamflow had fallen from a mean 28.6 GL yr(-1) in 1985-1990 to 13.6 GL yr(-1) in 2012-2017 this was with water that was potable. The challenge into the future is to ensure the lower stream salinity is maintained through maintenance of forest cover. Importantly, this paper demonstrates that stream salinity can be reversed following deforestation if an appropriate scale of reforestation is deployed.

AB Karst systems can be generally characterised by their high hydrological heterogeneities related mainly to highly variable permeabilities, which can significantly change over small spatial scales. This makes tracing and quantification of water flow pathways an extremely demanding task. In this study we present an analysis of hydrological characteristics of a complex karst system, the Ljubljanica river catchment in central Slovenia. Spatially distributed data on stable isotope composition (delta O-18, delta H-2) of precipitation as inputs, and of several karst springs/sinks as outputs, were obtained. These data were used to identify spatial and seasonal patterns and hydrological behaviour of the karst system in contrasting hydrological conditions. The intensive mixing of continental and Mediterranean air masses over the Ljubljanica river catchment makes the precipitation source identification difficult. However, the results of the precipitation isotopic composition analysis indicate a spatial pattern that could be recognised also in the delta O-18, delta H-2 values of the karst springs and sinks. Along the prevailing karst conduits, the spatial differences in the delta O-18, delta H-2 values decreased. The mean transit time (MTT) estimates using delta O-18, delta H-2 as tracers were similar, with those for the main karst conduits and tributaries ranging between 0.34 and 0.74 years. Such a relatively short MIT could be expected for karst catchments without extensive deep groundwater storage. The fraction of young water (F-yw) for the whole catchment was 0.28, meaning that more than one-quarter of the total discharge was younger than approximately 2.3 months (assuming that the catchment transit time is described by exponential distribution). Small differences in the MTT over different parts of the karst catchment area might indicate intensive mixing and homogenisation of water along the underground conduits. However, the catchment's homogenisation strongly depends on the preceding hydrological conditions; the differences in the isotope composition can be identified during low-flow conditions, which might indicate the dominant influence of the local recharge of the karst springs.

AB Sediment transport in open channels has complicated nature and finding the analytical models applicable for channel design in practice is a quite difficult task. To this end, behind theoretical consideration of the open channel sediment transport through incorporating of four fundamental characteristics of fluid, flow, sediment and channel, recently, machine learning techniques are used for modeling of sediment transport in open channels. However, most of the studies in the literature used limited number of data for model development neglecting some effective parameters involved which may affect their performances. Moreover, most of this studies had not provided a comprehensive explicit equation for future use. Accordingly, this study applied four machine learning techniques of Gene Expression Programming (GEP), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Generalized Structure Group Method of Data Handling (GS-GMDH) and Fuzzy c-means based Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (FCM-ANFIS) to model sediment transport in open channels. Four existing data sets in the literature with wide ranges of pipe size, sediment size, sediment volumetric concentration, channel bed slope and flow depth are used for the model development. The recommended models are compared with their corresponding conventional regression models taken from the literature in terms of different statistical performance indices. Results indicate superiority of the machine leaning techniques to the conventional multiple non-linear regression models. Although, developed GEP, ELM, GS-GMDH and FCM-ANFIS models have almost same performances, GS-GMDH gives slightly better performance which can be linked to the generalized structure of this approach. A MATLAB code is provided to calculate the sediment transport in open channel for practical engineering.

AB Empirical relationships linking kinetic energy to rainfall intensity are commonly used to estimate rainfall erosivity. In this paper, using the drop-size distribution (DSD) proposed by Marshall and Palmer, a relationship for calculating the rainfall kinetic power was firstly deduced. This equation requires the simultaneous measurement of both the median volume diameter and the rainfall intensity and its application also reveals the drawback of needing the measurement of the whole DSD by an expensive disdrometric technique.
   Then, using a fictitious precipitation, which is both constituted by droplets having the same diameter (mean volume diameter) and having the same volume of the actual rainfall, a new expression of the rainfall kinetic power was deduced. This last equation has the advantage of allowing the estimate of the rainfall kinetic power by using the measurements of both rainfall intensity and the total number of droplets, reaching a horizontal unit area in an unit time, which can be acquired by a cheap device using a piezoelectric force transducer.
   This new relationship for estimating the rainfall kinetic power was tested using disdrometric measurements carried out at two experimental sites in Italy (Palermo) and in Spain (El Teularet). These experimental tests demonstrated that the rainfall kinetic power estimated by the mean volume diameter has an accuracy similar to the literature relationships proposed by Wischmeier and Smith, Brown and Foster and McGregor et al.
   Finally this investigation also showed that this novel approach can be applied estimating the median volume diameter by the mean volume diameter and the standard deviation of the measured drop diameters, whose measurement can be obtained by a force transducer.

AB Three approaches were compared for estimating continuous soil water characteristic curves (SWCCs) from easily accessible soil properties. The approaches included combining the Mohammadi and Vanclooster (2011) method (the MV method) with the van Genuchten (1980) model (MV-vG approach), the modified MV-vG approach, and combining the Jensen et al. (2015) method with the Fredlund and Xing (1994) model (the J-FX approach). A total of 195 disturbed soil samples and 195 undisturbed soil cores were collected from 1-m soil profiles in an arid region of northwestern China. Particle size distribution (PSD) and organic matter (OM) content were determined. The volumetric water content and matric potential data pairs of each sample during the drying process were measured using a high speed centrifuge. All of the measured soil properties were used to evaluate the applicability of the approaches for continuous SWCC estimation. The MV method has a robust physical basis and is independent of any experimental SWCC data pairs. Some intrinsic shortcomings affect the estimation of continuous SWCC by the MV-vG approach. The integration of a soil structure feature improved the estimation of the modified MV-vG approach. The estimation of the J-FX approach for SWCC is robust for the five textural classes, and outperformed the MV-vG approach and the modified MV-vG approach. The good performance of the J-FX approach can be attributed in part to the fact that it distinguishes the dominant forces governing water retention of dry and wet ranges, and relates the PSD, specific surface area, and OM content to the pore size distribution. All these factors are vital for soil water retention, but have been simplified or ignored by the MV method. Both the modified MV-vG approach and the J-FX approach are promising for estimating continuous SWCCs at a regional scale. The modified MV-vG approach may be suitable for rigid soils with medium textures at potentials above wilting point. The J-FX approach is applicable for the whole range of water retention from saturation to oven dryness for soils with substantially varying bulk density, soil texture and organic matter content at a regional scale. The results of this study are fundamental for use in simulating the transfer of water and solutes in layered-structured soil profiles and for estimating the vegetation carrying capacity of soil available water in arid regions.

AB A smart decision making framework for stormwater management systems is designed through predictive real-time control (RTC) of the outlet gate of a stormwater basin. The proposed framework offers a cost-effective non-structural solution for dynamically controlling stormwater basins through manipulating the outlet gate and providing optimized outflow set-points. An integrated RTC optimization and rule-based approach is designed to mitigate the impact of the discharged runoff on the receiving watercourse, both in terms of quantity and quality. In this approach, the optimization part provides the optimized outflow set-points for the basin to minimize peak flows during the wet periods, while the rule-based part controls the quality of the discharged water, through sedimentation, by increasing the detention time. Various rainfall data series are used as inputs for a case study stormwater basin to verify the performance of the proposed methodology. The efficiency of the stormwater basin in reducing peak flows and improving the quality of outflow was estimated by comparing, respectively, the peak flows and detention times of the integrated RTC strategy with those of a static approach. The results showed an improved quantity and quality control performance for the studied stormwater basin, in comparison to the static control approach, both in current climate conditions with a peak flow reduction from 73 to 95% and detention times varying from 16 to 30 h, and in future climate conditions with an averagely reduction of 76% in peak flows and an average detention time of 19 h.

AB Water resources management often involves models that simulate physical/chemical processes to make predictions of future system behavior. These predictions often contain uncertainty that must be considered in order to make robust decisions. The quantification of this uncertainty is often not conducted in practice due to computational limitations and a lack of flexible software capabilities. To bridge this gap, we have developed a heuristic, multi-objective, model-independent optimization methodology using TCP/IP network communications for parallel run management on high-performance computing systems. The proposed optimization methodology is based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), where the memory-like nature of PSO makes it ideal for tracing a Pareto front that graphically illustrates the trade-off between competing objective functions. Although the focus of this study is on addressing the likelihood of an undesirable or contested model prediction, the proposed methodology can be extended to any multi-objective optimization context, and is also able to handle inequality constraints that reflect additional conditions that must be met along the front. We have demonstrated the algorithm on two important real-world case studies. The first case study involved water allocation issues in Antelope Valley, California, USA, where the uncertainty in total natural recharge into the valley has raised significant debates over water management. The second case study involved the re-injection of coal seam gas co-produced water into deep aquifers in the Surat Basin, Queensland, Australia, where the potential impact of an undesired mobilization of arsenic concentrations needed to be understood and managed. This case study required a highly nonlinear field-scale reactive transport model, and an inequality constraint was also necessary to maintain consistency with a laboratory-scale geochemical model. The efficiency at which the proposed methodology solved these complex case studies demonstrates its effectiveness for a broad range of applications.

AB Stormwater flow rate attenuation is an important component of stormwater management but the mechanisms governing peak flowrate attenuation have received limited attention in the green roof community. Previous green roof literature studies that have reported peak flow rate attenuation have focused on comparing the peak precipitation intensity with the peak drainage rate over a given storm event. However peak drainage rates do not necessarily correspond with peak precipitation intensity if peak precipitation intensity occurs before field capacity is achieved. As such use of event based flow rate attenuation does not facilitate investigation of the mechanisms governing peak flow rate attenuation. This study combines field data collected on a 200 m(2) green roof with a Richards based numerical model to quantify and provide new insights into the mechanisms governing flow rate attenuation. The average peak flow rate attenuation from all measured drainage events was 58% (n = 121 distinct rainfall peaks) and the average peak delay was 12.8 min. Field capacity was found to be a statistically significant point where attenuation performance decreases. Peak stormwater flow rate attenuation below field capacity was found to be significantly higher than after field capacity is reached with capillary storage the dominant attenuation mechanism before field capacity is reached and routing and gravity storage important attenuation mechanisms after field capacity is reached. The Richards equation based numerical model yielded very good predictions of observed peak flow rates using laboratory derived model parameters and without the need for model calibration. This study suggests that green roofs have considerable potential to attenuate stormwater flow rate, thus helping to mitigate damage due to urban runoff and providing some protection against storm intensification associated with climate change. The validated numerical model is a valuable tool for the prediction of stormwater flow rate attenuation in different climates and can therefore be used in green roof design and by regulators to better evaluate the potential benefits of green roofs.

AB Evaluation of the engrossment of watershed surface characteristics on partitioning of precipitation to runoff and evapotranspiration is key to inspect the availability of water at watershed scale. It is more evident in the cases of ungauged watersheds. The present study develops models using multiple linear regression method and machine learning techniques (ANN: Artificial Neural Network and RVM: Relevance Vector Machine) over 793 (25 major river basins and 768 watersheds across India) to estimate the watershed parameter 'omega' (in Fu's Budyko based equation) that represents intrinsic watershed attributes. In addition, seasonality factor is incorporated in the model due to intra-annual variability in vegetation across India. The models attempt to explain the intricate relationship between vegetation alterations and regional water balance. It is seen that the ANN and RVM models have performed better in estimating omega, than the MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) models. In addition, NDVI has shown more engagement in explaining the partitioning process of water in intra-annual low NDVI period compared to high NDVI period. We have also found the present models to be more accurate than the previously developed Budyko based methods in predicting omega. The newly improved models have closely imitated the intrinsic basin attributes and enhanced the functionality of Budyko framework in estimation of water availability, which would play a crucial role in assessment of hydrology of ungauged watersheds of India.

AB The robust optimization of groundwater quality monitoring network is subject to many conflicting objectives and high level of uncertainty in hydraulic conductivity. This study develops a two-stage stochastic optimization framework including the uncertainty quantification using a cheap-to-evaluate surrogate model and an improved epsilon multi-objective noisy memetic algorithm (epsilon-MONMA) for monitoring network design. The surrogate model based on sparse polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is constructed to replace expensive simulation model in the uncertainty quantification of concentrations at the pre-defined monitoring locations for reducing huge computational cost. Additionally, the scenario discovery strategy using sparse PCE model is applied to filter a typical scenario set and the centroid of contaminant plume is used as the diversity metric, which avoids enumerating all possible contamination plumes caused by the uncertain K-field in the optimization. The proposed algorithm is then employed to solve stochastic management model to achieve robust monitoring design, indicating the insensitivity of monitoring design to plume uncertainty no matter which of the many possible scenarios becomes the true distribution of contamination under the true K-field. A synthetic aquifer considering uncertainty in hydraulic conductivity is designed to optimize monitoring network design. The Pareto-optimal solutions to the synthetic example are achieved under three of plume scenario sets defined at deterministic scenario (Scenario A0), Monte Carlo based scenario discovery (Scenario A1) and surrogate assisted scenario discovery (Scenario A2), respectively. Comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the monitoring design based on Scenario A2 outperforms either of the two designs based on Scenarios A0 and A1 in terms of the improvement of robustness of designs evaluated against the typical scenario set. Meanwhile, the performance of monitoring network deteriorates as the uncertainty of plume (noisy strength) increases, indicating the significance of reducing parameter uncertainty in groundwater monitoring design. The research findings show that the developed stochastic optimization framework is a computationally efficient and promising tool for multi-objective design of groundwater monitoring network under uncertainty.

AB Thermal waters in the Central Highlands of Madagascar around Antsirabe were investigated using a combination of hydrogeochemical and isotopic methods, geochemical speciation and inverse geochemical modeling. Thermal waters at Antsirabe have temperatures from 35.2 to 47.7 degrees C, are highly mineralized (EC up to 5.87 mS/cm) are of Na-HCO3-Cl type and have elevated concentrations of arsenic (up to 0.597 mg/l), Sr (up to 8.05 mg/l) and Li (up to 2.83 mg/l). About 25 km west of Antsirabe, a thermal spring at Betafo has a temperature of 53.6 degrees C, but its mineralization is much lower (EC 0.72 mS/cm) and its water is of Na-HCO3-SO4 type. Concentrations of As, Sr, and Li at Betafo are much lower, only 0.006 mg/1, 0.72 mg/l, and 0.063 mg/l, respectively. Calculated reservoir temperatures using quartz and chalcedony geothermometers are up to 153 degrees C at Antsirabe and 108 degrees C at Betafo. Values of delta H-2 and delta O-18 are above the WMWL, indicating exchange with silicates like micas. Values of delta C-13(DIC) are very enriched (up to 0.45%x) in Antsirabe samples, but depleted with a value of 21.52%0 in a Betafo sample. Values of delta S-34(SO4) are close to -4.0 parts per thousand in all samples, suggesting an origin of sulfate from a Na-sulfate mineral. Values of Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios in Antsirabe samples suggest interactions with reservoir rocks. The principal difference between both sites seems to be in the significant input of magmatic-origin CO2 at the Antsirabe site (up to 61.4 mmol/l as determined by inverse geochemical modeling) with resulting higher dissolution rates of As-containing silicate minerals such as micas. There is probably no such input at the Betafo site. In spite of relatively lower As concentrations compared to geothermal waters at global tectonic plate margins, concentrations of As at Antsirabe can represent a serious environmental problem.

AB Interaction between meteorological and hydrologic processes is challenging to model owing to their high spatio-temporal variability. The understanding of their associations can help to ensure future fresh water security with changing climate. In this study, due to continuously evolving nature of these interactions, the hydrological and meteorological variables are studied on wavelet component level. Multi-Resolution Stationary Wavelet Transformation (MRSWT) is used to transform the independent (climatic variable) and dependent (hydrological variable) time series into their components. The components of the dependent time series are modeled using a kernel-based auto-regressive (AR) model for separating their memory part. The residuals are hypothesized to be the effect of interaction of predictor variables and thus, are modeled using the MRSWT components of meteorological variables in an auto-regressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX). Finally, the predicted residuals (effect of climatic variables) are added to the component estimated by kernel-based AR estimator (memory of dependent series components) to obtain the predicted components of the dependent hydrologic variable, which are then inverse-transformed to obtain the predicted dependent hydrologic variable. The developed hybrid Wavelet-ARX is found to capture the information about relationship between synthetically generated data better than a simple ARX model. The model is then applied to predict total monthly rainfall over Upper Mahanadi Basin and is found to effectively extract the information from the poorly associated hydro meteorological variables. While the potential of Wavelet-ARX is found to be impressive for hydro meteorological applications, additionally, discarding some climatic inputs on the basis of their relative importance may lead to better prediction by the developed model. The developed model is suitable for extracting climatic forcings and is desirable in a changing climate.

AB This study proposes a new method for downscaling actual evapotranspiration from resolution of 1-km to 30-m. The disaggregation approach is performed using the Jarvis model to simulate surface resistance, which describes the restriction of vapor from land surface, in the water exchange process without using land surface temperature data. The integrated surface resistance model, which takes climate indicators and canopy conditions into account, is primarily validated using in situ observations and employed in the downscaling model with considerable accuracy covering an entire growing season (April-October) in Zhangye Oasis. Good performance and good agreements between daily downscaled results and flux records from an EC (Eddy Covariance) tower have been obtained. The coefficient of determination (R-2) ranges from 0.80 to 0.91, and the mean bias (MB) ranges from 0.17 to 0.72. The vegetation growth process is also captured well by the downscaled results. The proposed method in this research performs better than downscaling approach based on land surface temperature. The accurate validation results and detailed spatial patterns suggest that the proposed downscaling strategy is reliable for water resource management.

AB Dams and reservoirs provide decision-makers and managers with appropriate control on the available water resources, allowing the implementation of various strategies for the most efficient usage of the available water resources. In areas where water supply exhibits significant temporal variation when compared with the demand, the challenge is to bridge the gap and achieve an optimal match between the water supply and demand patterns. Therefore, the release of water from reservoirs should be controlled to ensure that the operation rule for the available water storage in the reservoir is optimized to satisfy the future water demands. This level of optimal control can only be achieved using an efficient optimization algorithm to optimally derive the operation rule for such a complex water system. Herein, two main methods have been considered to tackle this water resource management problem. First, three different optimization algorithms, namely particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, and whale optimization algorithm, have been applied. In addition, two different optimization algorithms, namely crow search algorithm and master-slave algorithm, have been introduced to generate an optimal rule for water release policy. Further, the proposed optimization algorithms have been applied to one of the most critical dam and reservoir water systems, namely the Aswan High Dam (AHD), which controls almost 95% of Egypt's water resources. The current operation of AHD using the existing optimization rules resulted in a mismatch between the water supply and water demand. In other words, the water availability could be higher than the water demand during a certain period, whereas it could be less than the water demand during another period. The results denoted that the master-slave algorithm outperforms the remaining algorithms and generates an optimization rule that minimizes the mismatch between the water supply and water demand.

AB Post-processing of hydrological model simulations using machine learning algorithms can be applied to quantify the uncertainty of hydrological predictions. Combining multiple diverse machine learning algorithms (referred to as base-learners) using stacked generalization (stacking, i.e. a type of ensemble learning) is considered to improve predictions relative to the base-learners. Here we propose stacking of quantile regression and quantile regression forests. Stacking is performed by minimising the interval score of the quantile predictions provided by the ensemble learner, which is a linear combination of quantile regression and quantile regression forests. The proposed ensemble learner post-processes simulations of the GR4J hydrological model for 511 basins in the contiguous US. We illustrate its significantly improved performance relative to the base-learners used and a less prominent improvement relative to the "hard to beat in practice" equal-weight combiner.

AB This study focused on the sensitivity of flood dynamics to soil hydraulic properties derived from three different soil databases in urbanized area: (1) upscaled locally observed soil texture data based on the soil-landscape relationships (SMLS); (2) the SoilGrids250m open data source (SMSG); and (3) the FAO soil map (SMFAO). However, soil in the urban areas has two major conditions related to land cover and soil physical structure for which the information is not available in soil databases: the effect of fragmented vegetation cover and the effect of compaction of bare soil. Non-built-up areas can be covered by fragmented vegetation (grass and shrubs) which generally has high infiltration rates. In contrast, bare areas such as dirt roads and footpath can be heavily compacted and have typically low infiltration rates. We used Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) with satellite-derived vegetation cover and bare soil to predict soil hydraulic properties related to the uncompacted and compacted scenarios. Infiltration dynamics was derived from the predicted soil hydraulic properties for these soil information sources, which then determined the flood dynamics in the catchment. The flash flood modeling was done using the integrated flood modeling system using openLISEM (Bout and Jetten, 2018) for the whole of Kampala (Uganda) using the 25th of June 2012 flood event. In the distributed openLISEM hydrological model, these two urban soil conditions have been treated separately. We have evaluated the sensitivity of flood dynamics to three different soil databases under both uncompacted and compacted urban soil conditions by using different flood indicators such as catchment water balance, infiltration rate, flood depth and duration, flooded area and flood volume, and the average number of structures affected. The result of the study indicates that soil hydraulic properties needed for the distributed hydrological model are better predicted when using the SMSG and SMLS, which resulted in better infiltration simulation. Consequently, compared to an earlier simulation that was verified with stakeholders and accepted for drainage system design, the accuracy of the simulated flood extent map was better when using SMSG and SMLS. Moreover, soil compaction significantly reduces infiltration and consequently increases the flood depth and duration, and therefore, must be included in the urban flash flood modeling study.

AB To manage a river sudden pollution incident, a fundamental task is to quickly identify when, where, and how much pollutant was released. The source identification of this kind of pollution incident due to instantaneously spilled pollutant from point source remains a challenging problem because of the limited observations and the ill-posedness. In this paper, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is coupled with the backward location probability (BLP) to improve its performance in identifying the river pollution source. When applied in practice, the proposed BLP-EnKF method has two important advantages. First, it supports on-line identification and can mitigate the limitation from shortage of observations in the sudden river pollution case. Second, BLP-EnKF performs much better than conventional EnKF in terms of computation time, because it can identify the pollution source without restart forecast process. The effectiveness and efficiency of BLP-EnKF is tested and demonstrated by a synthetic case study. The case results show that the BLP-EnKF can identify all the source parameters with a relative error approximately 1.00% or smaller. Its performance can be further improved with more accurate estimation of observational error or dispersion coefficient. A real-world case in Ganjiang River further demonstrates the applicability of BLP-EnKF in practice. The pollution source is identified successfully with relative errors smaller than 3.0% for all the source parameters, while the computation time is sharply shorted from 8.0 h of conventional EnKF to 22.0 s of BLP-EnKF.

AB Environmental tracer data, such as the stable water isotopic composition of streamwater and precipitation, are valuable for understanding runoff generation processes and calibrating hydrological models. Despite recent technical advancements, the collection and analysis of streamwater and precipitation samples still involve significant costs and efforts. Consequently, it is useful to study how many samples need to be collected as a basis for model calibration and what the most informative sampling times are. In previous studies, we used the Birkenes hydrological model and synthetic data to explore the value of a few stream isotope samples for event-based model calibration. Our results showed that the information from two or three selected isotope samples, and particularly a sample taken during the falling limb of the hydrograph, improved model performance significantly compared to calibration against streamflow data only. In this follow-up study, we used a unique Swiss dataset with high-frequency isotope measurements of precipitation and streamwater during six rainfall-runoff events to determine which stream isotope samples were most informative for model calibration. Several benchmarks were used to judge model validation performance. Our results showed that for 83% of the 42 possible combinations of calibration and validation events two strategically selected streamwater samples improved model performance compared to the lower benchmark when only stream stage data were used for calibration. The most informative samples also improved the calibration of a mixing-related parameter. When the model was calibrated and validated for the same event, the most informative samples for model calibration were those from the early part of the falling limb, which confirmed the results of the previous studies with synthetic data. Pre-event isotope samples were more informative when the model was calibrated for one event and then validated against other events or all events combined. Our results suggest that relatively inexpensive event-based data for model calibration can be obtained for so-far ungauged catchments by placing a water level logger in the stream and collecting precipitation isotope data and a few streamflow samples. These samples should preferably include a pre-event sample and a sample from the early falling limb. However, similar analyses for a wider range of sites and events, in combination with a selection of models with different structures and assumptions, are needed to confirm these results and to optimise sampling strategies further.

AB Improved spatial and temporal resolutions in quantification enable the water footprint (WF) in crop production to be a comprehensive indicator of water consumption in agricultural water management. In general, existing literature focus on the impact of water-saving irrigation techniques on crop yield and water consumption during the growth period at sites or experimental units, few studies yet that explicitly addresses the effect of developments in water-saving irrigation techniques on large-scale WF accounting and benchmarking. Here, we fill this gap through a case study for wheat in China over 2000-2014, during which the micro-irrigated wheat area expanded 14 times. The green and blue WFs of China's wheat per year are estimated at a 5 arc-minute resolution. For irrigated wheat, we distinguish three irrigation techniques: furrow, sprinkler and micro-irrigation. The WF benchmarks by irrigation type are further estimated separately for arid and humid zones. Irrigation accounted for 70% of annual WF in China's wheat land, while furrow irrigation dominated the national total WF. The occupation by WF under micro-irrigation was the smallest but jumped by 14 times in quantity whereas that under sprinkler halved. China's average WF per ton of wheat under sprinkler irrigation was 21% higher than that under micro-irrigation in 2014. The 20th percentile WF benchmarks of wheat under micro-irrigation was 13% and 31% smaller than that under furrow and sprinkler irrigation, respectively, in arid zones. Meanwhile, high provincial heterogeneities in terms of WF under varied distribution of irrigation techniques were also shown. The study shows possibility and importance to account for developments of water-saving techniques in large-scale crop WF estimations.

AB Increasing city resilience to floods under climate change has become one of the major challenges for decision makers, urban planners, and engineering practitioners around the world. Accurate prediction of urban floods under heavy precipitation is critically important to address such a challenge as it can help understand the vulnerability of a city to future climate change and simulate the effectiveness of various sustainable engineering techniques in reducing urban flooding risks in real urban settings. Here, we propose a new model for urban flood prediction under heavy precipitation. The model divides an irregular urban area into many grid cells with no limitation on the spatial resolution as long as the DEM data of the same resolution are available. It is capable of reflecting the frequent inflow or outflow interactions among grid cells and capturing the rapid generation of surface runoff in urban areas during heavy rainfall. The model also accounts for typical characteristics of urban areas, such as large-scale impermeable surfaces and urban drainage systems, in order to simulate urban floods more realistically. In addition, the model uses both surface elevation and instantaneous surface water depth of all grid cells to dynamically determine the directions of horizontal inflow and outflow during each time step of model simulation. This enables the model to capture the reverse-flow phenomenon which is commonly seen in flat urban areas during heavy storms. By applying the proposed model for reproducing the 2016 flood in Lafayette Parish, Louisiana, we demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting real-world flood events.

AB Dewatering using a combination of waterproof curtain and pumping wells is commonly adopted to ensure the stability of foundation pits in multi-aquifer strata. However, dewatering is likely to result in environmental problems. This paper investigates the impact on surroundings owing to the interaction between the waterproof curtain and pumping wells by numerical simulation. The depth of the diaphragm wall penetrating the dewatering aquifer (D) and the filter length of pumping wells (L) are varied in the simulation. The relationship between approximate hydraulic gradient (Delta i) or ground settlement outside the foundation pit (S) with curtain depth ratio R-D (D over the thickness of the dewatering confined aquifer H-a) or filter length ratio R-L (L/H-a) can be divided into three change parts, namely initial gradual, middle sharp and final gentle part. Three values of R-D and R-L, namely effective, suggested and control value, are proposed. R-D and R-L should vary between the effective and control value. The suggested value of R-D and R-L, is recommended in actual engineering by comprehensive consideration. The effective, suggested and control value of R-D can be calculated by a linear equation according to the value of R-L.

AB This study explores the utility of observations of deuterium excess (dx) of water vapor for attribution of vapor to remote source regions and local influences. A Lagrangian back trajectory model was combined with various parameterizations of the dx of ocean evaporation and land evapotranspiration to simulate daily vapor dx at a continental site, a marine site and a coastal site. The model reproduced reasonably well the observed variabilities in the vapor dx at the coastal and the marine site when water vapor at these sites were primarily influenced by large-scale advection from ocean sources. The simple parameterization relating dx of the ocean evaporation to relative humidity is a robust representation of the ocean isotopic evaporation. On the other hand, the model did poorly for the continental site and during the land evapotranspiration dominated months at the coastal and the marine site, confirming the published findings that the water vapor dx near the Earth's surface can be significantly altered by land evapotranspiration and therefore is not a conserved tracer of humidity from the marine moisture source region. Several parameterizations for the dx of land evapotranspiration suggested by previous studies were tested with the trajectory model, but none brought improvement to the simulation of the dx at the continental site. Our study emphasizes that a fundamental challenge in isotopy hydrology is the lack of understanding of the different fractionation processes of O-18 and D associated with land evapotranspiration.

AB Although previous studies have estimated the effects of human regulations on hydrological drought, few studies have examined the impacts from the perspective of the development and recovery processes of hydrological drought. This study uses the Dongjiang River Basin in south China as an example and focuses on the influence of reservoir operation on hydrological drought. The Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) and run theory were applied to determine the development and recovery processes of hydrological drought. A semi-distributed hydrological model, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), was used to simulate long time series (> 30 years) monthly streamflow data; the SWAT model was calibrated and validated using the monthly streamflow data from periods with less human regulations. Streamflow was then simulated and compared by using the same model parameters, as well as the sub-surface features, to simulate the streamflow during the human regulation periods. The "simulated-observed" comparative approach (i.e., a comparison of the characteristics of the hydrological drought obtained from the simulation-based SSI and observation-based SSI) was used to assess the impacts of human regulations on hydrological drought development and recovery. The results showed that the 'simulated-observed' comparison approach based on the SWAT model exhibited a good ability to ascertain the impacts of human regulations on hydrological drought development and recovery. The reservoir operation was the dominant factor affecting the hydrological drought propagation in the lower reaches of the Dongjiang River basin and had mostly a short-term effect by decreasing the duration and severity of drought development (or recovery). However, the reservoirs tended to release water during the development process and to store water during the recovery process during a long-term hydrological drought in the study area, leading to an increase in average recovery duration and severity. The results of this study may further optimize water resources management system during drought for effective drought prevention and mitigation.

AB Reliable and accurate prediction of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is a precondition for the efficient management and planning of agricultural water resources as well as the optimal design of irrigation scheduling. This study evaluated the performances of four bio-inspired algorithm optimized extreme learning machine (ELM) models, i.e. ELM with genetic algorithm (ELM-GA), ELM with ant colony optimization (ELM-ACO), ELM with cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and ELM with flower pollination algorithm (ELM-FPA), for predicting daily ETo across China by using a five-fold cross-validation approach. These models were further compared with the classical ELM model parameterized by the grid search method to demonstrate their capability and efficiency. Daily maximum and minimum ambient temperatures, wind speed, relative humidity and global solar radiation data during 2001-2015 collected from eight meteorological stations in contrasting climates of China were utilized to train, validate and test the models. The results showed that ETo values predicted by all ELM models agreed well with the corresponding FAO-56 Penman-Monteith values, with R-2, RMSE, NRMSE and MAE ranging 0.9766-0.9967, 0.0896-0.2883 mm day(-1), 3.2910%-11.7653% and 0.0708-0.1998 mm day(-1), respectively. The ELM-FPA model (R-2 = 0.9930, RMSE = 0.1589 mm day(-1), NRMSE = 5.5406% and MAE = 0.1188 mm day(-1)) slightly out-performed the ELM-CSA model (R-2 = 0.9922, RMSE = 0.1619 mm day(-1), NRMSE = 5.6864% and MAE = 0.1200 mm day(-1)) during testing, both of which were superior to the ELM-ACO (R-2 = 0.9912, RMSE = 0.1730 mm day(-1), NRMSE = 6.0816% and MAE = 0.1254 mm day(-1)) and ELM-GA (R-2 = 0.9889, RMSE = 0.1895 mm day(-1), NRMSE = 6.7197% and MAE = 0.1310 mm day(-1)) models, followed by the standalone ELM model (R-2 = 0.9856, RMSE = 0.2104 mm day(-1), NRMSE = 7.1693% and MAE = 0.1408 mm day(-1)). The four hybrid ELM models exhibited higher improvements in daily ETo prediction in the temperate monsoon and (sub)tropical monsoon climates (with average decrease in RMSE of 14.0%, 25.1%, 31.4% and 33.1%, respectively), compared with those in the temperate continental and mountain plateau climates (with average decrease in RMSE of 5.2%, 9.8%, 12.9% and 14.1%, respectively). The results advocated the capability of bio-inspired optimization algorithms, especially the FPA and CSA algorithms, for improving the performance of the conventional ELM model in daily ETo prediction in contrasting climates of China.

AB An abrupt change is an important manifestation of hydroclimatic variability. Accurate detection of change points is a critical issue in hydroclimatic and climate change studies. In the article, we evaluated the performances of 12 methods (including both parametric and non-parametric) for detecting change points in hydroclimatic time series by considering the influences of eight major factors. Different methods exhibited different efficiencies and eight of the methods performed better which are recommended for application. Furthermore, the mean values of series and locations of change points were found to have little influence on the detection of change points. However, for a time series with smaller variance but bigger skewness and larger difference in the mean values before and after the change point, the abrupt changes can be more easily and accurately detected. Detection of change points in shorter series would have larger uncertainty. Based on the Monte-Carlo experiments, the efficiency of each method was quantified and its capability was quantitatively clarified. Detection of abrupt changes in precipitation over Southwest China showed that the Indian monsoon had a dominant influence on precipitation in the regions south of 30 degrees N and west of 110 degrees E. Since 2007 the Indian monsoon has maintained a weakening pattern, causing a decrease in precipitation on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, which is one of the main causes of frequently occurring droughts. Results of this study can be a useful reference for choosing a method to detect change points in hydroclimate time series, and be an important complement for the detection and attribution of hydroclimatic variability.

AB In this study, we developed a one-dimensional mobile-mobile model (MM) for contaminant transport in subsurface with depth-dependent reaction coefficients. Two local systems at micro-scale level are involved in this model: a micro-pore system and a less permeable pore system. The breakthrough curves (BTCs) obtained from the MM with depth-dependent coefficients were thoroughly analyzed, where the case with constant coefficients was used as the reference system. The effects of different parameters on BTCs were studied, and a parameter analysis was also performed to illustrate the effects of adsorption coefficient and degradation coefficient on BTCs. Results show that the BTC patterns for the depth-dependent reactions, in which the reaction rate decreases with increasing depth, vary between the two extreme cases with constant-rate reactions in the topsoil and observation depth. The mass transfer coefficient (alpha) plays a significant role in defining the BTC pattern. The double peak changes to a single peak when the value of alpha is large enough. In addition, the velocity of the main flow determines the shape of the BTCs while the velocity of the SVD defines the pattern of the dual peaks in BTCs which also tends to be represented by a single peak as the velocity decreases. Finally, we tested the applicability of the proposed model (MM-FD) in the leaching experiments of both field herbicide and conservative tracer in an agricultural area of northeastern Greece, and compared its performance with that of the advection-dispersion equation (ADE) model by Gao et al. (2013), both of which have depth-dependent coefficients. The results showed that the proposed mobile-mobile model with depth-dependent reaction coefficients was able to satisfactorily capture the evolution of metolachlor concentration both at upper and lower depths.

AB Accurate and reliable short-term runoff prediction is of great significance to the management of water resources optimization and reservoir flood operation. In order to improve the accuracy of short-term runoff forecasting, a hybrid model-based "feature decomposition-learning reconstruction" named VMD-DBN-IPSO was proposed. In this paper, variational mode decomposition (VMD) is first used to decompose the original daily runoff series into a set of sub-sequence for improving the frequency resolution. Partial autocorrelation function (PACF) is then applied to determine the input variables of each sub-sequence. The improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is combined with the deep belief network (DBN) model to predict each sub-sequences and finally reconstruct the ensemble forecasting result. Three quantitative evaluation indicators, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), were used to evaluate and compare the established models using the historical daily runoff data (1/1/1988-31/12/2017) at Yangxian and Ankang hydrological station in the Han River Basin of China. Meanwhile, a comparative analysis of the performance of VMD-DBN-IPSO model under different forecast periods (1-, 3-, 5- and 7-day lead time) was performed. In addition, the prediction ability of peak runoff of the VMD-DBN-IPSO model is further verified by analyzing the 10 peak flows during the testing data-series. The results indicate that the VMD-DBN-IPSO model can always achieve the best performance in the training and testing stage, and has good stability and representativeness, the NSE coefficient remains above 0.8, and the prediction error of peak flow is within 20%. It is a preferred data-driven tool for forecasting daily runoff.

AB The hydrological regimes of downstream reservoirs have been significantly altered due to the operation and regulation of upstream cascade reservoirs. The original design flood quantiles, namely "design flood in construction period", do not consider anthropogenic impacts in reservoir operation period, and have led to enormous conflicts between flood control and conservation. In this study, the "design flood and flood limited water level in operation period" are defined for practical application. We establish a general framework to measure the spatiotemporal pattern of streamflow and to estimate design floods of cascade reservoirs in operation period. The multivariate t-copula and a genetic algorithm strategy are proposed to solve the curse of dimensionality encountered in the derivation of most likely regional composition. The Jinsha River and Yalong River cascade reservoir system in China, which consists of 13 large reservoirs with the total storage capacity of 74.06 billion m(3) and hydropower capacity of 71.47 GW, is selected as a case study. Results indicate that: (1) The curse of dimensionality can be well addressed by applying multivariate t-copula to build high dimensional joint distribution and using the genetic algorithm to achieve the most likely regional composition. (2) Compared with the design floods in construction period, the design floods of downstream reservoirs in operation period have been significantly reduced due to the upstream reservoir regulation. The 1000-year design peak flood discharge, 3-day, 7-day and 30-day flood volumes of Xiangjiaba reservoir decrease by 38.7%, 37.4%, 34.2% and 13.8%, respectively. (3) The flood limited water level of these reservoirs can be raised without increasing flood control risks in operation period. The cascade reservoirs in the Jinsha River and Yalong River can generate 3.28 billion kW h more hydropower (or increase 4.3%) annually during flood season.

AB Knowledge about the origin and transformation of nutrients at different temporal scales in river ecosystems can provide a better understanding of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles in rivers and bear important implications for regional and global C and N cycling. In this study, stable isotopes of C and N (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and a radioactive isotope of Pb-210 were used to investigate the factors affecting seasonal and long-term changes in N source apportionment and C and N biogeochemical processes in the Beijiang River located in the Pearl River basin, China. Source apportionment by a Bayesian model (stable isotopic analysis in R, SIAR) showed significant seasonal variations. During the flood season, the dominant origins were non-point sources, such as soil N for dissolved nitrogen (DN, accounting for 38%), soil organic matter for particulate organic matter (POM, 58%) and sedimentary organic matter (SOM, 31%), due to intense precipitation. During the non-flood season, fertilizer became the dominant nitrate source (48%), and effluent detritus prevailed in the POM (47%) and SOM (32%) pools. N transformation between the DN, POM and SOM was influenced by seasonally variable hydrology. Our data suggested that low discharge was more favorable for the vertical mixing of the water column and sedimentation, which was supported by similar delta N-15 values in the DN, POM and SOM in the non-flood season. A sedimentary history record of 65 years (1951-2015) showed that the variation of N in the sediment was mainly affected by human activities. From 1999 to 2005, a decreasing trend in the delta N-15 values was observed due to the promotion of aquatic plant cultivation after reservoir impoundment. From 2005 to 2011, the enrichment in the delta N-15 values was caused by increases in manure and sewage due to the development of the tourism industry. From 2011 to 2015, the increase in pollution treatment funds from the government improved the water environment, resulting in delta N-15 depletion in the sediment. At the 65-year temporal scale, increased temperature and CO2 concentration had less impact on the C and N cycles in river ecosystems, however, high discharge could increase the C and N contents, and flood events might increase the delta N-15 values in the sediment. This study provided more detailed information regarding the nutrient sources and improved our understanding of the C and N cycling processes at different temporal scales in river ecosystems.

AB Non-contact flow measurement method plays an increasingly important role in river discharge measurement. However, most channel cross-section velocity distribution models proposed by researchers have certain limitations in application, underwater velocities are always necessary when applied in narrow channels, which makes it challenging to calculate natural river discharge using water-surface velocities measured by remote sensing instruments. This letter takes water-surface velocities detected by UHF radar as boundary conditions and a new velocity distribution model is derived based on the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (BANS) equations. UHF radar measures surface velocities of the cross-section, and velocities on the river bed of the cross-section are considered to be 0. The BANS equations are simplified to be a two-dimensional Poisson equation and the cross-section velocity distribution is solved by using the closed boundary conditions. Some field experiments were conducted in the Hanjiang River at Xiantao, Hubei, China in September 2017 and April July 2018, the processing results of which show that the proposed model is superior to the power law and the log law models, especially near the side wall (narrow channel region). River discharges calculated by this method are highly consistent with those provided by Hubei Xiantao hydrologic station, which verifies the reliability of the model and the feasibility of using UHF radar to measure natural river discharge continuously and automatically.

AB Industrialization and urbanization expansion may change the groundwater quality in the Pearl River Delta (PRD). The aims of this study were to evaluate the groundwater quality in various aquifers and areas with different urbanization levels in the PRD, to extract the main impact indicators, and to discuss the driving forces for the groundwater quality. Nearly 400 groundwater samples were collected and 23 indicators were analyzed. In the PRD, 83% groundwater was drinkable (good-quality) by using a fuzzy synthetic evaluation method. Groundwater in karst aquifers was drinkable, and its quality was better than those in granular and fissured aquifers. In the latter two aquifer types, groundwater quality in non-urbanized areas was much better than those in peri-urban and urbanized areas. In granular aquifers, Mn + Fe, I- + Ni + Mn, and Mn + As + I- were the main impact indicators for poor-quality groundwater in urbanized areas, peri-urban areas, and non-urbanized areas, respectively. Correspondingly, reductive dissolution of Fe/Mn (oxy)hydroxides, infiltration of industrial wastewater and reductive dissolution of I- and Mn, and reductive dissolution of Mn, As, and I- were likely responsible for poor-quality groundwater in these areas, respectively. By contrast, in fissured aquifers, NO3-, NO3- + Pb, and I- were the main impact indicators for poor-quality groundwater in urbanized areas, peri-urban areas, and non-urbanized areas, respectively. Correspondingly, infiltration of domestic sewage, infiltration of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater, and mineralization of I-rich organic matter were probably responsible for poor-quality groundwater in these areas, respectively. Industrialization was one of the main driving forces for groundwater quality in granular and fissured aquifers in peri-urban areas, while urbanization was one of the main driving forces for groundwater quality in fissured aquifers in urbanized and peri-urban areas in the PRD.

AB It is challenging to predict groundwater level (GWL) accurately and reliably in reclaimed coastal areas, the dynamic of which has been greatly altered by the land reclamation activities, due to its diverse engineering boundaries. In this study, the data-driven Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models (nonlinear input-output network (NIO), nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX), and wavelet-NARX (WA-NARX)) are used to predict the GWL in a newly reclaimed land on Zhoushan Island, China. The models use semi diurnal tide (SDT) and precipitation as input variables, and the wavelet coherence (WTC) is applied to analyze the response of GWL to SDT. The results show that the WA-NARX hybrid model provides better prediction performance, especially for short-term periods. Meanwhile, we also explore the correlations between GWL and SDT in the filled and clay layers by using the WTC and the global coherence coefficient (GCC). The results show strong correlations at 0.5-, 1-, and 15-day time scales (resonance periodicities), which are then used as prediction periods for ANN models. The correlation is stronger for the filled layer than that for the clay layer indicates GWL in the filled layer is more sensitive to SDT, especially at 0.5-day time scale. The predicted results also confirm that SDT and precipitation have great influences on GWL with better prediction in the filled layer.

AB The real-time operation of multi-reservoir systems is a vital issue in the field of reservoir management. The uncertainty caused by inflow forecasting means that risk analysis is necessary for such real-time operation. However, differences in the length of the forecast periods for different reservoirs in the system are seldom considered in the risk analysis of multi-reservoir systems. This paper presents a two-stage flood risk analysis method of multi-reservoir systems that takes the differences in the length of forecast lead-times into consideration. The aim of the proposed method is to evaluate the uncertainty of the flood forecasting by dividing the operation horizon into the forecast lead-time and the beyond-forecast time period. The risk within the forecast lead-time is estimated by counting the frequency of failure numbers among all scenarios with the help of the scenario-based forecasts. The risk beyond the forecast time period is determined using reservoir flood routing with the design flood hydrographs, which are selected according to the differences in the length of the forecast periods between any two reservoirs. The proposed two-stage risk analysis method is verified using stochastic simulations method based on Monte Carlo sampling. A real-time flood control operation model is established by taking the proposed two-stage risk analysis method as a constraint. China's Ankang-Danjiangkou Cascade Reservoirs are considered as a case study, and the results indicate that the proposed real-time operation model can increase hydropower generation by 0.22 billion kWh during the summer flood season without increasing the flood risk in the multi-reservoir system. The proposed method enhances our understanding of risk management for the real-time flood control operations in multi-reservoir systems.

AB The urban drainage model is an important tool for the management and decision-making around an urban drainage network. Owing to urban drainage networks' complex distribution, existing model analysis methods have gradually exposed problems of insufficient utilization of spatial information, weak coupling and analytical capacity of multi-source heterogeneous data, and poor human-computer interaction. By coupling an urban drainage model with 3D GIS technology and 3D visualization technology, this study presents a 3D dynamic visualization method of an urban drainage model (3DDVM-UDM). A case study from Chaohu, China, is used to demonstrate the method. The environmental information and distributions of pipe network objects in 3D space were presented. The urban drainage model can be edited and simulated in the 3D environment, and a 2D flooding simulation method was also established. Multiple model results were dynamically and simultaneously visualized in the pipe network entity models. By coupling and comparing the model results under different rainfall return periods, various information was intuitively analyzed, such as the water level and water quality differences of each pipe and node, and the spatial distribution differences of fully filled pipes, overflowed nodes and buildings influenced by node overflow. The operation state of a drainage pipe network can be systematically analyzed by intuitively combining with the attribute information of a pipe network, 3D spatial information and other relevant data. This study provides a feasible theory and method to assist in environmental management and decision-making, to facilitate communication between different fields, and to promote a shift in analysis from 2D to the combination of 2D and 3D.

AB Mongolian pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica) has been widely used in vegetation restoration and for windbreaks in sandy regions of northern China where water is the principal factor limiting tree survival and growth. An understanding of water use in Mongolian pine plantations is critical for effective vegetation restoration. To determine water sources in a Mongolian pine plantation, we investigated the stable isotopic ratios of delta O-18 and delta D in precipitation, groundwater, in soil water in different soil layers, and in tree xylem at different tree ages along a precipitation gradient and in different micro-landforms. The results indicated that the main water sources for Mongolian pine were precipitation-derived shallow soil water in semi-humid regions and that the contribution proportion decreased with an increase in tree age. With reduced precipitation in semi-arid and arid regions, contribution of deep soil water to Mongolian pine water use gradually increased, and differences in soil water contribution among trees due to tree age also significantly increased. Water use patterns in trees planted in different micro-landforms (e.g. sand dune crest or inter-dune lowland) became more distinct as precipitation gradually decreased across humid to semiarid and arid regions. Moreover, Mongolian pine, including 15-, 20-, 25-, and 45-year-old trees, similar height and DBH without groundwater in semi-arid climate (in Ejin Horo banner), while trees planted in extremely arid climate (Linze) relied on irrigation for survival despite abundant and available groundwater at that study site. These results indicated that groundwater may be beyond reach to be a main water source for Mongolian pine trees. Soil water conditions determined the survival and sustainable growth of planted trees, especially at depths less than 1 m where soil layers were recharged mainly by precipitation. Although Mongolian pine exhibits strong ecological adaptability, a trait that makes it ideally-suited for controlling desertification in sandy regions of northern China, water stress, crown dieback, or even tree mortality are likely to occur under conditions of extremely low precipitation.

AB Biochar has been increasingly used as an amendment to enhance soil structure and improve soil hydraulic properties. Nevertheless, there are very limited physically based studies to investigate solute transport in biochar-amended soils at pore scale. In this study, for the first time, synchrotron-based X-ray micro-computed tomography (SR-mu CT) was used to obtain high-resolution pore geometries of two clayey soils and their biochar amended samples, then the three-dimensional lattice Boltzmann (LB) method was implemented to simulate solute transport using the pore structure information. By using the innovative method of combining SR-mu CT and LB simulation, we found that biochar amendment reduced the spatial variability of pore water velocity and increased the dispersion coefficient by one order of magnitude. In addition, we observed that anomalous dispersion was more likely to occur in soils with biochar amendment. Furthermore, soils after biochar amendment had relatively higher thresholds of both the transition zone and advection-dominated zone for the dispersion coefficients. These results are crucial in understanding nutrient transport processes and contaminant migration occurring at pore scale.

AB The Wenchuan area has become highly susceptible to landslides and debris flows since the earthquake occurred on 2008. A detailed debris flow hazard assessment is necessary to provide information for future risk management. Debris flow runout on a depositional fan is an important factor for assessing debris flow hazard, and its estimate becomes essential for the planning of the mitigation works that must be built. We therefore developed two simple empirical relationships based both on univariate and multivariate approaches, which provide the runout distance using the data for 134 channelized debris flow events in 134 catchments in the Wenchuan earthquake zone. We generated a correlation matrix of the debris flow runout distances and the relevant variables. Because of the high correlations, the independent variable debris flow volume (V-D) was selected for the univariate approach. Using a multicollinearity analysis and a stepwise regression technique, the catchment (basin) internal relief (H), and V-D were used to develop a multivariate runout relationship. The coefficients of the variables were obtained using 80% of the dataset (training dataset); the remaining 20% was used for test of estimated performance by comparing the computed runout distances with observed values. The validation demonstrated that the proposed relationships are suitable for estimating the runout distances of debris flows on depositional fans in the Wenchuan earthquake zone. The univariate runout relationship has the advantage of being simple, whereas the multivariate runout relationship provides higher accuracy. Additionally we rearranged and reformulated existing relationships using the same training dataset and compared the results with those from the relationships here proposed. The estimations provided by our relationships were the closest to the observed values. The presented approaches may be applied to estimate debris flow runout distances in other areas after they are retrained using local datasets.

AB Following the scheme of the groundwater-soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (GSPAC), a simple process-based model (SiTH; Simple Terrestrial Hydrosphere) was developed to estimate the dynamics of terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) at the daily step. The input data include net radiation, air temperature, precipitation, leaf area index, vegetation type and soil data, most of which are readily available. Locally, the model performed well in simulating the dynamics of ET and soil moisture over selected FLUXNET sites. Globally, the daily 0.25 degrees ET and groundwater table depth estimations in year 2005 were determined using available gridded datasets. The spatial pattern was reasonable and the range of values corresponded well with other global ET and groundwater table depth products. In future studies, we will produce a long-term daily 0.25 degrees global ET and groundwater table depth products that spans from 1984 to present by using different input datasets.

AB Accurate water level forecasts during flood events are crucial to mitigate the loss of human lives and economic damages. However, the accuracy of flood models can be affected by various factors, including the complexity of the terrain geometry and bathymetry, imperfect physics as well as uncertainties in the inflows and parameters. This paper describes a practical implementation of an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) based data assimilation system that is aimed towards enhancing the forecasting skill of flood models. The system was implemented and tested with a real world dam break flood, based on the experimentally scaled Toce River valley flood that occurred on July 8th, 1996. Water depth data are available for assimilation from a network of 21 sensors distributed across the domain. Our results demonstrate that assimilating data into the flood model significantly improves the model prediction by up to 90% after assimilation and 60% during forecasting. Assimilating the data more frequently significantly enhances the system performances. Estimating the two-dimensional Manning coefficient together with the model's dynamical variables (water depth and velocities) further improves the model prediction skill. Overall, our results suggest that assimilating data into the flood model, while jointly inferring the state and (poorly known) parameters, using an EnKF may provide an efficient framework for developing an operational flood forecasting system.

TI Neurofibroma and Meningioma within a Single Dumbbell-Shaped Tumor at the

AB BACKGROUND: Cases of multiple intracranial tumors are common; however, cases of multiple intraspinal tumors are rare. Except for cases of neurofibromatosis, it is very rare for tumors of different pathological types to exist concurrently at the same spinal level. Only 9 cases have been reported to date, with meningioma found with schwannoma in 7 cases and with neurofibroma in 2 cases.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We have reported another rare case in which neurofibroma and meningioma were identified within a single dumbbell-shaped tumor at the same cervical level without neurofibromatosis. The preoperative magnetic resonance imaging findings indicated a single extra- and intradural extramedullary dumbbell-shaped neurogenic tumor on the left ventral side of the cervical spine. Intraoperatively, we found that the mass consisted of 2 pathologically different tumors. The results of surgical resection were mostly satisfactory.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, the present case is the first reported case of intradural neurofibroma (not meningioma) and extradural meningioma growing mixed together at the same spinal level without neurofibromatosis. The precise mechanism underlying the formation of the tumor is unknown, and multidirectional differentiation of a common progenitor cell is one possibility. Intra- and extradural exploration and component biopsies are useful for treatment planning, especially when the magnetic resonance imaging is not sufficiently sensitive for the diagnosis of coexisting tumor types.

AB BACKGROUND: Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common subtype of thyroid cancers, accounting for >90% of all thyroid carcinomas. Despite a favorable long-term survival rate of 94.4%, people with distant metastases show worse outcome. Cerebral metastases are slightly uncommon and stand for only 1%-3% of all metastases.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a 56-year-old male patient complaining of serous headaches for >20 days. lie underwent thyroidectomy surgery 13 years ago due to papillary thyroid carcinoma and was reported "tumor free" on his follow-ups without any complaints. On his cranial magnetic resonance imaging scan a right temporal mass lesion was detected. During surgery, the tumor was removed and reported as papillary thyroid carcinoma metastasis.
   CONCLUSION: A case in which a patient with papillary thyroid carcinoma developed brain metastasis after such a long time was not reported in the literature before.

AB Oligodendrogliomas, the third most common primary gliomas, have a strict molecular definition, characterized by the combined presence of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation and 1p19q codeletion. Herein, we describe an extremely unusual case of molecularly defined anaplastic oligodendroglioma with transdural extension into the frontal and ethmoid sinuses, without prior neurosurgical intervention or radiotherapy. The molecular profile of the tumor is also provided. To the best of our knowledge, this has never been reported before. Most of the previously reported glial tumors with transdural extension were cases of histologically proven glioblastomas and gliosarcomas, typically seen in the context of prior neurosurgical intervention and/or radiotherapy. This case adds to the limited literature on oligodendrogliomas with transdural extension. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the relationship between the incidence of transdural extension and molecular subtypes of oligodendrogliomas.

ID ECCHORDOSIS-PHYSALIPHORA; CHORDOMA; DIAGNOSIS; SECONDARY; DISTINCT;
   LESIONS; ENTITY; REST; CT
AB BACKGROUND: There are no absolute defining criteria for benign notochordal cell tumors; the diagnosis is usually based on small size and the absence of aggressive features. Therefore, by definition, the diagnosis is subjective and usually determined by multidisciplinary consensus. A benign notochordal cell tumor should not grow during surveillance, and this may be used to confirm the diagnosis, but is a tautologic definition. Diagnostic ambiguity leads to uncertainty in management. If a tumor is a small chordoma then early surgery is likely to provide a better outcome. However, unnecessary treatment of a benign tumor may incur unjustified risk.
   OBJECTIVE: To propose dearer guidelines for the definition and management of benign notochordal tumors.
   METHODS: We performed a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) review of the reported definitions for benign notochordal tumors and their management.
   RESULTS: The accepted features of benign notochordal tumors vary considerably: a typical tumor may be diagnosed in the absence of neurology, radiologically well-corticated bony margins, size <35 mm, no enhancement with contrast, no soft tissue extension, no dural penetration, no progression on scans, histologic absence of extracellular myxoid matrix, and low Ki67 index. If these criteria are fulfilled, it is reasonable to use radiologic surveillance in the first instance. Biopsy may be offered depending on the relative risks of performing the biopsy, or if there are atypical features.
   CONCLUSIONS: We suggest a clearer definition for a benign notochordal tumor and a management algorithm that incorporates a level of diagnostic uncertainty.

AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial extension of frontal or ethmoid sinusitis carries a high morbidity and mortality if not treated aggressively. With the emergence of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), we questioned whether these approaches have supplanted traditional transcranial procedures for intracranial extension of sinus disease, and whether ESS approaches had a difference in patient outcomes.
   METHODS: Studies reporting surgical management and outcomes of frontal sinus disease with intracranial extension were queried using the United States National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health PubMed database. We also queried common Internet search engines. We included studies regarding sinogenic intracranial suppurative infections treated surgically with ESS and neurosurgical approaches. Studies with insufficient data regarding specific treatment methods and studies that included populations of medically treated infections were excluded.
   RESULTS: A total of 108 cases were identified in which patients with intracranial sinogenic disease were treated via ESS alone (morbidity: 43.5%, mortality: 0.9%), 47 cases via transcranial intervention alone (morbidity: 33.2%, mortality: 7.8%), and 43 cases via simultaneous neurosurgical and ESS approaches (morbidity: 16.3%, mortality: 6.4%). Complex sinus disease with posterior table compromise in the absence of intracranial extension treated via ESS alone was reported in 164 cases with a morbidity and mortality of 3.8% and 0%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Combined ESS and transcranial approaches achieve definitive control of sinogenic and intracranial disease, whereas either modality alone carries a potential risk for higher morbidity and mortality. The use of ESS alone may have use in the treatment of sinusitis with posterior table erosion prior to intracranial extension.

   DISEASE
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal osseous tuberculosis, or Pott's spine, although very common in endemic countries, has a lower incidence in very young children. However, the infection has the propensity to cause greater vertebral destruction in this age group, leading to severe structural kyphotic deformity and associated neurologic deficits. We report the case of a 19-month-old child with severe tubercular kyphotic deformity of the upper thoracic spine managed with posterior vertebral column resection (VCR) and nonfusion posterior pedicle screw instrumentation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This 19-month-old boy presented with 1-month history of spontaneous-onset, progressive, painful rigid kyphotic deformity of the upper back associated with spastic paraparesis with bowel and bladder incontinence. Magnetic resonance imaging showed severe destruction of bodies of D4-D7 vertebrae with cord edema and draping of the spinal cord over the internal gibbus at D4-D7 Surgery was performed with a restricted anterior fusion via single-stage posterior VCR at D4- D7 with nonfusion pedicle screw instrumentation from D1 to D9, with subsequent extension of instrumentation to D10 after 4 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: Multilevel posterior VCR with a restricted fusion and non-fusion pedicle screw instrumentation beyond the resection site can be safely done in young children (age <3 years) requiring rigid tubercular kyphotic deformity correction. However, these patients require regular follow-up and may need multiple surgeries.

TI Endoscopic Paramedian Forehead Flap Reconstruction of the Anterior Skull
   Base for Recalcitrant Cerebrospinal Fluid Leaks: Minimally Invasive
   Adaptation of Ancient Flap
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Anterior skull base defect; Local flaps; Paramedian forehead flap;
   Radiation
ID SECONDARY; OUTCOMES; DEFECTS
AB BACKGROUND: The anterior skull base (ASB) remains one of the greatest challenges for reconstructive surgeons. The current armamentarium includes endoscopic placement of free grafts, endonasal vascularized pedicled flaps, regional flaps, and microvascular free flaps. As the defect size increases, reconstruction complexity increases along with potential complications. Here, we report an endoscopic-assisted paramedian forehead flap, a novel adaptation of an age-old technique, for ASB reconstruction.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 66-year-old male underwent a dual bifrontal and transnasal endoscopic approach for the resection of a T4N0M0 sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma. The resulting ASB defect was repaired using simultaneous pericranial and nasoseptal flaps. Adjuvant radiation therapy resulted in delayed radiation necrosis in the right frontal lobe 3 years later requiring debridement via a supraorbital approach. Recovery from this operation was complicated by an ASB defect and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. The defect remained despite multiple attempts at endoscopic repairs. Due to multiple medical comorbidities, the patient was not a candidate for microvascular reconstruction. Prior surgeries had disrupted the traditional regional flaps (i.e., pericranial, nasoseptal, and temporoparietal fascia flaps) bilaterally. Therefore the novel endoscopic-assisted paramedian forehead flap was used to successfully repair the ASB defect. Postoperatively, the patient has done well with no recurrences in the CSF leak.
   CONCLUSIONS: The endoscopic-assisted paramedian forehead flap is a robust regional flap whose advantages include the utilization of muscle, low donor morbidity, and endoscopic placement with avoidance of craniotomies. Therefore it should be considered an important option for ASB reconstruction of recalcitrant CSF leaks when all other options are unavailable.

TI Arteriovenous Fistula of the Filum Terminale: A Case Report and Review
   of the Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Arteriovenous fistula; Endovascular; Microsurgery; Myelopathy; Spinal
   stenosis
AB BACKGROUND: Fistulas of the filum terminale are rare lesions that result from a fistulous connection between the artery and vein of the filum terminale. These lesions often present as progressive thoracic myelopathy secondary to venous hypertension that is transmitted to the corona! venous plexus of the spinal cord. Frequently, filum fistulas will be associated with lumbar stenosis and likely form as a result of chronic inflammation and compression. However, owing to the relative rarity of filum fistulas and the commonality of lumbar stenosis, the presence of a filum fistula could be overlooked or misdiagnosed.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We have presented the case of a 62-year-old man with severe lumbar stenosis who had presented with progressive thoracic myelopathy. The evaluation, including spinal angiography, identified a low-flow arteriovenous fistula within the filum terminale that was successfully treated with microsurgical obliteration. The patient tolerated the procedure well, with good functional recovery within 1 month.
   CONCLUSION: Just as was the case with our patient, these lesions demonstrate a high association with lumbar stenosis and tethered or tight cord syndrome. We reviewed the clinical presentation, imaging findings, surgical management, and possible mechanisms of development for these rarely encountered fistulas.

ID SPONTANEOUS CLOSURE
AB BACKGROUND: The incidence of traumatic arteriovenous fistula (TAVF) between the middle meningeal artery (MMA) and the petrosal vein (PV) is rare. Although TAVF has been reported involving the MMA several sinus and veins, this is the first incidence of a fistula involving the extracranial MMA and PV.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a 47-year-old male with sudden onset of weakness of his right limb and speech difficulty a few hours before admission to our facility. He had a 6-month history of mild traumatic head injury. Initial computed tomography revealed midbrain hemorrhage while digital subtraction angiography revealed a TAVF of the left MMA. Enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, however, revealed communication between the MMA and PV. We treated the patient with coil embolization via the transarterial route.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first incidence of a fistula connecting the extracranial and PV. We managed the patient with only coil embolization without any further neurologic deficits.

ID ACUTE STROKE; DETACHMENT; DEVICE
AB BACKGROUND: Some mechanical thrombectomy techniques for acute ischemic stroke use a combination of an aspiration catheter and stent retriever. We experienced a rare case of aspiration catheter coil breakage and subsequent retrieval using a stent retriever.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 79-year-old man suddenly developed somnolence, global aphasia, and right hemiplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed acute infarction of the left frontal lobe and occlusion of the left common carotid artery. Thus, using an aspiration catheter and a stent retriever, mechanical thrombectomy was performed. The stent retriever was deployed from the middle cerebral artery to the internal carotid artery and retracted into the aspiration catheter placed in the internal carotid artery proximal to the thrombus. The catheter was bent during retraction of the stent retriever. After thrombus aspiration, the internal carotid and anterior and middle cerebral arteries were successfully reperfused; however, the stent retriever captured a broken section of the winding coil of the aspiration catheter. We suspected that an X-ray marker on the stent retriever broke the winding coil at the bent segment of the aspiration catheter and the stent captured the broken coil.
   CONCLUSIONS: The combined use of an aspiration catheter and a stent retriever may cause unexpected device breakage, especially when the catheter is bent.

ID 10-0 NYLON; SIMULATION; SKILLS; PLACENTA
AB BACKGROUND: Microscopic training is essential for development of neurosurgical skills. A range of models is reported in the literature for this purpose, including live animals, exvivo, and synthetic material. Among the factors involved in selection and development of a training station, cost is a decisive one.
   METHODS: We present a low-cost model to practice microvascular anastomoses using a bovine heart and an artificial perfusion system. We also present a brief review of laboratory models for microsurgical training, focusing on the costs and reproducibility of the different options.
   RESULTS: Exvivo models are a great bridging point between nonbiologic and living animal training models. These models have major similarities to human vessels, such as lumen size and malleability of the arteries. The bovine heart model allowed the residents to gain confidence in handling vascular tissue in a microscopic environment.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although these models do not resemble anatomic landmarks in the human brain, the bovine heart model allowed the residents to gain confidence in handling vascular tissue in a microscopic environment.

DT Review
DE IgG4-related disease; Pachymeningitis; Spine
ID DISEASE; STATEMENT; FEATURES; IGG4
AB BACKGROUND: Back pain is a leading reason for patients to seek medical attention. Although musculoskeletal causes are common, patients can also present with rarer etiologies.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old man presented with 2 months of isolated upper back pain initially suspected to be secondary to overuse muscular strain. During the next 3 months, his pain worsened, and he developed lower extremity dysesthesia and subjective weakness, despite normal neurological examination findings. Nonrevealing laboratory workup included normal muscle enzymes, C-reactive protein, urinalysis, and human leukocyte antigen B27. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a normal brain but a hypointense C7-T5 epidural mass, prompting a neurosurgical recommendation for laminectomy with evacuation of the suspected hematoma. His symptoms fully and promptly resolved after a 5-day course of prednisone 40 mg. When his symptoms recurred within 2 months, he underwent T4-T5 laminectomy with biopsy of a mass confluent with the dura mater. Initial pathological examination revealed fibrotic tissue of unclear etiology with polyclonal lymphoid infiltrate but no malignant cells, vasculitis, or granulomas. After months of recurrent, steroid-responsive symptoms, he presented to the rheumatology clinic. Repeat spinal magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated progression of epidural thickening with suspected spinal cord compression. Previous biopsy samples were then immunostained for IgG4, revealing focally dense IgG4-positive plasma cells, up to 29 cells per high power field, consistent with spinal IgG4-related hypertrophic pachymeningitis. He began rituximab therapy with a prednisone taper and demonstrated symptomatic and neurologic improvement with successful withdrawal from corticosteroids.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, the present case represents the 12th reported case of spinal IgG4-related hypertrophic pachymeningitis. An early diagnosis and treatment could prevent progression to permanent neurological impairment and functional disability.

ID SURGERY; GRAFT
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebellar cyst formation after surgery is uncommon, and cases of this condition have been previously reported. These cases had an intraparenchymal cyst in the cerebellar hemisphere that required surgical fenestration of the cyst. We herein present a rare case of a postoperative cerebellar cyst with pseudomeningocele and magnetic resonance images indicating a fistula between the cyst and pseudomeningocele.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A patient presented with an intraparenchymal cyst and aunding edema in the cerebellar hemisphere that developed after a C1 laminectomy and a small suboccipital craniectomy for the removal of an accessory nerve neurinoma at the craniovertebral junction. Fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition images identified the fistula connecting the cyst and extradural cerebrospinal fluid retention. Conservative management with administration of dexamethasone induced spontaneous regression of the cyst, and no recurrence had occurred by the 1-year follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Watertight dural closure is important for the prevention of rare complication after posterior fossa surgery. However, an arachnoid tear on the cerebellar fissure and adjacent dural defect are necessary antecedents for this rare condition. High-resolution fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition images could provide additional information for the etiology of postoperative cerebellar cyst.

AB BACKGROUND: Neurocysticercosis, caused by the larval form of the tapeworm Taenia solium, is the most common parasitic disease affecting the human central nervous system. The incidence of spinal neurocysticercosis in endemic regions ranges from 025% to 5.85%. Surgery is preferred when medical treatment fails to achieve control of the symptoms or when multiple cysts are present.
   METHODS: We describe the use of spinal flexible endoscopy for patients with spinal neurocysticercosis who failed to achieve control with standard treatment. Three patients with limb weakness and pain underwent a midline interspinous approach at the L5-S1 level to access the lumbar cistern. The flexible endoscope was introduced, the subarachnoid space was inspected, and the cysticerci were extracted. In 1 patient with cervical subarachnoid blockage, a 3-cm suboccipital craniotomy and removal of the posterior arch of C1 were performed to place a subarachnoid-to-subarachnoid catheter going from the craniocervical junction to the thoracic region.
   RESULTS: Removal of the cysticerci was possible in all No complications related to the surgery were observed. All patients received medical treatment for 2-3 months, and all symptoms were solved.
   CONCLUSIONS: Flexible spinal endoscopy is a feasible valuable tool in patients with spinal neurocysticercosis that do not respond adequately to standard treatment. It helps restore cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and can be used to place shunt catheters under guided vision. Longer endoscopes are needed to explore the entire spinal subarachnoid space with a single approach, and more research in this area is needed.

   sign; Spastic gait; Spinal cord injury
ID MUSCULAR-ATROPHY; FUSION
AB BACKGROUND: Hirayama disease (HD), characterized by insidiously progressive muscular atrophy of forearms and hands, is a self-limited cervical myelopathy that predominantly affects male adolescents, with female patients, especially middle-aged women, rarely affected. We present a rare case of HD with severe spinal cord injury in a 34-year-old woman.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 34-year-old woman presented with progressive weakness of both hands and forearms for a duration of 6 years and spastic gait for 1 year. The patient worked as a teacher and experienced long-term and repetitive neck flexion while writing at a desk, potentially causing cervical loading. Examination showed weakness and muscular atrophy of the bilateral upper limbs and pyramidal signs, including Hoffmann sign and hyperreflexia of the lower limbs. Radiologic studies revealed midcervical kyphosis and spinal cord compression by forward displacement of the dura mater with neck flexion. The clinical presentation and radiologic characteristics confirmed the diagnosis of HD. Anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion was performed owing to severe spinal cord injury, and the patient experienced satisfactory improvement.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present case clarified the potential involvement of cervical kyphosis and cervical loading-related exercise in the onset and progression of HD. Anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion could serve as a promising treatment of HD with severe spinal cord injury.

DT Article
DE Anterior cranial fossa; Dural arteriovenous fistula; Frontal;
   Frontobasal; Surgical obliteration
ID INTERHEMISPHERIC APPROACH; NATURAL-HISTORY; MANAGEMENT; ARTERY;
   CLASSIFICATION; MALFORMATIONS; COMPLICATIONS
AB BACKGROUND: Surgical obliteration is generally recommended for anterior cranial fossa dural arteriovenous fistulas (ACF DAVFs) because of a high risk of bleeding and the difficulty of endovascular approaches. Surgical obliteration is generally performed via a frontobasal craniotomy; however, it is slightly excessive over the target fistula. Here, we present 2 cases of ACF DAVFs treated with small craniotomy without frontal sinus involvement and a review of the related literature.
   METHODS: We present 2 cases including a 63-year-old -aan who presented with a right-sided ACF DAVF that was fed by both ethmoidal arteries and drained into the right cortical veins (case 1) and a 59-year-old man with right-sided unruptured multiple aneurysms and a left-sided ACF DAVF that was fed by the right ethmoidal artery and drained into the left cortical veins (case 2).
   RESULTS: Case 1 underwent surgical obliteration via a right main frontal craniotomy. Case 2 was simultaneously treated with surgical clipping of the multiple aneurysms via a right lateral supraorbital craniotomy and surgical obliteration of the ACF DAVF via a left high frontal craniotomy. These 2 patients had no neurologic deficits, and complete obliteration of all the lesions was confirmed on cerebral angiography.
   CONCLUSIONS: Constructing a small corridor and a deep working distance in unilateral small high frontal craniotomy may be a slightly unusual approach; however, it is thought to provide sufficient space and a range of microscopic views that facilitate surgical manipulation without requiring extensive bone work.

ID CIRCUMSCRIPTA; PROGRESSIVA; MIMICKING; TRAUMATICA; HISTORY; SPORT
AB BACKGROUND: Myositis ossificans is a benign process of heterotopic bone formation developing in soft tissues that can mimic malignancy. Differential diagnosis can be difficult without a biopsy when it originates in atypical locations.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 5 1/2-year-old boy was admitted for a cervical tumor causing torticollis. The nodular tumor developed at the lateral border of the right C3-4 foramen, had calcification/ossification at its periphery, and was accompanied by a huge edematous reaction of the scalene muscles. The patient underwent an extensive work-up by pediatric oncologists. A biopsy was requested because of high suspicion of malignancy. At surgery, the lesion was benign on frozen sections and was completely resected, allowing the diagnosis of myositis ossificans. The patient made a rapid and complete recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Myositis ossificans circumscripta is rare in children, especially in the neck region. The diagnostic challenge is to differentiate it from bone and soft tissue malignancies. Appropriate management, including surgery if needed, leads to an excellent outcome. Another concern is to exclude fibro-dysplasia ossificans progressiva when atraumatic myositis ossificans develops in a young child in the neck or shoulder region.

   CHILDREN; AGE
AB OBJECTIVE: To technically review and explore long-term follow-up results of aqueductoplasty and stenting under flexible neuroendoscopy in infantile obstructive hydrocephalus.
   METHODS: The clinical data, surgical techniques, and long-term effects in 14 infants with obstructive hydrocephalus treated by flexible neuroendoscopic aqueductoplasty and stenting between 2008 and 2010 were analyzed retrospectively.
   RESULTS: The 14 infants had a mean age of 5.71 +/- 3.10 (range, 2 -11 months) and a mean duration of follow-up of 62.64 +/- 34.52 months (range, 9-121 months). Subdural effusion was observed in 4 infants (28.6%) after surgery. There were no deaths or serious complications related to intracranial stent placement. Three infants (21.4%) failed, 2 due to proximal aqueduct occlusion from a short stent length and 1 due to intraluminal ependymal adhesion obstruction. One case was abandoned when a second surgical adjustment stent was unsuccessful, and the other 2 cases went to shunt surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Aqueductoplasty with stenting is a feasible and safe surgical procedure for treating infants with midbrain aqueduct stenosis or occlusion. However, the optimal stent material and definitive outcomes after this procedure require additional long-term follow-up studies in large numbers of infants.

TI Surgical Rescue Technique for Incomplete Burr Hole Using a Small Bone
   Piece and the Craniotome
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Craniotomy; Neurosurgical technique; Osteoporosis
AB BACKGROUND: Incomplete penetration of a burr hole sometimes occurs when performing a craniotomy in elderly patients due to osteoporosis. Completion of the burr hole takes more time and may sometimes cause tearing of the dura mater. We have introduced a small bone piece method that can easily and reliably recover an incomplete burr hole safely.
   METHODS: 1) Cut out a small bone piece of the outer table of about 5-mm size using a rongeur. 2) Place the small bone piece in the center of the incomplete burr hole. 3) Push on the small bone piece with a craniotome after unlocking the safety stop mechanism. 4) Restart and complete the burr hole with the craniotome.
   RESULTS: We succeeded in 10 of 11 incomplete burr holes. One case that failed had osteoporosis. There were no complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Application of the unlocked craniotome the small bone piece can easily complete the burr hole. Less bone deficit is caused compared with making a new burr hole. In addition, time is saved without changing the attachment, and the burr hole is completed safely. This small bone piece method is effective to recover an incomplete burr hole.

TI Infundibular Epidermoid Cyst: Case Report and Systematic Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Cystic epithelial tumor; Intracranial epidermoid cyst; Pituitary tumor
ID PITUITARY; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial epidermoid cysts are benign, congenital, keratinizing, squamous epithelial-lined cysts filled with keratin. They are uncommon and often pose a surgical challenge owing to the adherence to surrounding structures. They are typically found at the cerebellopontine angle or in the parasellar region, where they are associated with abnormal development of the Rathke pouch; involvement of the pituitary stalk is rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient's electronic health record was queried for relevant data. A systematic review of the literature using dedicated search terms for cases of infundibular epidermoid cysts was conducted. We present a unique case of a 55-year-old male who presented with vision changes and was found to have a parasellar epidermoid cyst confined to the pituitary stalk. The patient underwent endoscopic transsphenoidal resection, and gross total resection was achieved. The patient's postoperative course was significant for possible chemical meningitis and the development of panhypopituitarism. The patient's vision subjectively improved after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although 3 other cases of epidermoid cysts involving the pituitary stalk were identified, our patient's tumor was unique in that it was confined to the stalk. Our patient's case highlights a surgical approach to parasellar epidermoid cysts and the possible complications associated therewith.

AB Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a major health care problem and a significant social and economic issue worldwide. Considering the generalized failure in introducing effective drugs and clinical protocols, there is an urgent need for efficient treatment modalities, able to improve devastating post-traumatic morbidity and mortality. In this work, the status of brain trauma research is analyzed in all its aspects, including basic and translational science and clinical trials. Implicit and explicit challenges to different lines of research are discussed and clinical trial structures and outcomes are scrutinized, along with possible explanations for systematic therapeutic failures and their implications for future development of drug and clinical trials. Despite significant advances in basic and clinical research in recent years, no specific therapeutic protocols for TBI have been shown to be effective. New potential therapeutic targets have been identified, following a better understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying TBI, although with disappointing results. Several reasons can be pinpointed at different levels, from inaccurate animal models of disease to faulty preclinical and clinical trials, with poor design and subjective outcome measures. Distinct strategies can be delineated to overcome specific shortcomings of research studies. Identifying and contextualizing the failures that have dominated TBI research is mandatory. This review analyzes current approaches and discusses possible strategies for improving outcomes.

DT Article
DE Cervical lipomyelocele; Congenital inclusion cyst; Dorsal dermal sinus;
   Spinal dysraphism
ID SPINE
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal dysraphism refers to a group of congenital malformations affecting the spine and the spinal cord. Although there are several varieties, all have one thing in common, i.e., faulty closure of midline structures at embryogenesis. Rarely, these anomalies are associated with spinal inclusion cysts. Lipomyelocele (LMC) is a type of spinal dysraphism wherein the neural elements along with fat herniate through a posterior defect in the spine. A vast majority of these anomalies are seen in the lumbosacral region, and their occurrence in the cervical region is extremely rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-year-old female patient presented with swelling over the nape of her neck since birth, with recent-onset paresthesia and unsteady gait. On local examination, a soft fluctuant swelling with blackish discoloration of skin was noted at the nape of the neck. Radiographs revealed congenital C4-C5 block vertebra with defect in posterior elements from C4 to C6. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a cervical LMC with extramedullary intradural congenital inclusion cyst. Other notable findings were dorsal dermal sinus in cervical region, low lying tethered cord, and aberrant right subclavian artery. In our literature review, we could find only 1 case report of a cervical LMC and no cases reported of cervical LMC with congenital inclusion cyst.
   CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we report a case of a cervical LMC with a spinal inclusion cyst.

   venous outflow disturbance; Stenting; Styloid compression; Styloidectomy
ID INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION; COMPRESSION; DIAGNOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Internal jugular vein stenosis (IJVS) results in poor venous outflow and can result in intracranial hypertension. Venous stenting has become a debated topic for correction of this pathology.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 49-year-old male merchant with bilateral IJVS presented with headache, dizziness, and pulsatile tinnitus. He was found to have intracranial hypertension and left IJVS caused by styloid process compression and right IJVS caused by damage of the venous intima. His symptoms improved after undergoing styloidectomy followed by left intra-internal jugular vein (IJV) balloon. However, 1 year later, the prior symptoms reoccurred. At this time, the patient underwent right intra-IJV stenting. After treatment of the contralateral side, the symptoms resolved during the following 3 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: The clinical practice in this case indicated that in patients with bilateral IJVS, a 2-side intervention may be necessary when unilateral correction fails. We advise a staged approach to correction of bilateral IJVS. Styloid compression-induced IJVS should be corrected by styloidectomy in combination with balloon and/or stenting, whereas IJVS induced by venous wall issues needs only stenting.

   TASK-FORCE; THROMBOCYTOPENIA; MANAGEMENT; ASPIRATION; ADULTS
AB BACKGROUND: Eisenmenger syndrome is a rare sequela of uncorrected genital heart disease complicated by pulmonary hypertension, from which reversal of the pathologic left-to-right cardiovascular shunt and cyanosis follow. Right-to-left shunting can lead to paradoxical cerebral emboli-increasing the risk of spontaneous or iatrogenic stroke and cerebral abscess.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 38-year-old man presented with new focal seizures due to a brain abscess. Ventricular septa! defect and pulmonary hypertension were identified. Despite dexamethasone and broad-spectrum antibiotics, he developed hemiparesis and altered mental status and required emergent stereotactic abscess drainage. Despite the anesthetic hazards of Eisenmenger syndrome, the procedure was successful and the patient recovered completely.
   CONCLUSIONS: Noncardiac perioperative mortality in Eisenmenger syndrome is historically reported up to 19%, and risks are further increased with prolonged case duration or hypotension, mandating vigilant attention to volume status. Correspondingly, shorter- or lower-risk procedures such as stereotactic drainage are recommended. Procedures should be performed only at centers with expertise in management of Eisenmenger syndrome and cardiac-specialized anesthesiologists whenever possible. Although a conservative approach with early, aggressive medical management is preferred, operative intervention may be required in the setting of progressive deterioration and excellent postoperative outcomes are achievable.

TI Intracranial Methotrexate-Associated Lymphoproliferative Disorder in
   Rheumatoid Arthritis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Lymphoproliferative disorder; Methotrexate; Rheumatoid arthritis
AB BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is widely used as an anchor drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) because of its ability to control pain and inflammation. However, few studies have shown that long-term MTX use can lead to lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) in these patients. Here we describe a rare case of intracranial MTX-associated LPD in a patient with RA.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 68-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of progressive right limb palsy. She was diagnosed with RA 15 years ago and has been receiving MTX therapy for the past 5 years. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head revealed a ring-enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe. Open biopsy was performed for making a definite diagnosis and planning treatment. Hematoxylin-eosin stain revealed dense proliferation of atypical lymphocytes in the perivascular lesion. Immunohistochemistry results were positive for CD20; this lesion was observed as a strong nuclear signal on in-situ hybridization for the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA. Finally, the patient was diagnosed with MTX-associated LPD. We discontinued MTX administration and initiated steroid therapy for RA. The intracranial lesion reduced in size, and her symptoms resolved after MTX discontinuation; no recurrence has been observed at 3 years after MTX discontinuation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial MTX-associated LPD is extremely rare. Here we describe a particular case and review the literature pertaining to intracranial MTX-associated LPD. More attention should be paid to LPD in a patient receiving immunosuppressive treatment for RA.

   Microvascular anastomosis; Neurosurgery
ID MICROVASCULAR SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Laboratory training is a very important step on the development of the skills necessary for a neurosurgeon. This can be achieved using animal models and surgical microscopes or stereomicroscopes. Methods, like the use of fluorescein, increase the lifelike situation and allow anyone to assess the patency of an anastomosis and improve the quality of this training.
   METHODS: We report the use of a stereomicroscope with white light and a fluorescence mode used to perform dissection of small arteries and anastomosis using a chicken wing model. Using an affordable device, we could perform fluorescein videoangiography to asses the patency of those anastomosis and improve the quality of the training skills in microsurgery.
   RESULTS: The stereomicroscope is a useful tool for laboratory training and can be used as a substitute of a surgical microscope for microsurgery training. The fluorescence mode allowed us to perform fluorescein videoangiography with very a good quality of image.
   CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgery training is important part in the life of any neurosurgeon. Using a stereomicroscope with a fluorescence mode is an affordable method that can be reproduced in any laboratory in the world.

TI Familial Os Odontoideum: Proatlas Segmentation Abnormality
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Dystopic; Familial; Os odontoideum; Posterior fusion; Proatlas
AB BACKGROUND: Os odontoideum is a smooth, independent ossicle separated a from hypoplastic odontoid process located cranially in the expected position of the odontoid tip. The pathogenesis of os odontoideum remains controversial, and several etiological theories have been suggested for congenital, developmental, and traumatic origins.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We have reported symptomatic familial cases of dystopic os odontoideum in 2 elderly sisters who denied any traumatic history of the head and neck. Both patients were treated surgically, with successful outcomes achieved.
   CONCLUSIONS: When examining the etiology of os odontoideum, checking for the existence of a traumatic history is important. However, a more important matter is to consider morphological segmentation abnormalities of the proatlas. Segmentation abnormalities of the proatlas could be closely connected to the development of familial os odontoideum.

DT Article

ID HEMIFACIAL SPASM
AB BACKGROUND: Glossopharyngeal neuralgia (GPN) and trigeminal neuralgia (TN) can result from mechanical stimulation of the glossopharyngeal nerve (GPNv) and trigeminal nerve (TNv) by blood vessels. TN can cause severe pain in the orofacial region, whereas GPN manifests as pain in the tongue, throat, tonsil, and ear. Although these 2 neuralgias can occur concurrently, concurrence of recurrent TN and GPN that develops postoperatively has not been previously described.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 68-year-old male complained of right glossalgia and pain in the pharynx radiating to the right auricular area. The patient had previously undergone microvascular decompression (MVD) for right TN. Medication and intraoral xylocaine spray did not relieve the symptoms. An oral surgeon was unable to find any disease related to the glossalgia. The anesthesiologist pointed out that the symptoms could be from partial recurrence of the TN because the patient also complained of pain in the inferior alveolus. Magnetic resonance angiography indicated that the right GPNv seemed to be compressed by the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA); hence, MVD for both GPN and TN was performed. lntraoperatively, the right PICA was found to be adherent to the GPNv because of the thickened arachnoid membrane and was subsequently detached. The TNv was also examined, but only a Teflon ball was found, which was detached from the TNv. The GPN disappeared postoperatively, although TN persisted after the second operation.
   CONCLUSIONS: GPN can result from adhesions between the GPNv and arachnoid membrane following previous MVD.

AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial de novo arachnoid cysts in adults are rare, suggesting the involvement of head trauma and inflammatory diseases. We report a symptomatic adult case of nontraumatic de novo arachnoid cyst on the ventral medulla oblongata.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old man came to our hospital complaining of dysphagia and writing difficult since 3 months ago. There was no history of head injury or inflammatory disease. A 25-mm cystic lesion was found on the ventral side of the medulla oblongata on brain magnetic resonance imaging, and the lower cranial nerve and medulla oblongata were highly compressed. The lesion did not exist on magnetic resonance imaging performed 9 years ago. Capsular resection was performed, and the histologic diagnosis was a typical arachnoid cyst. After the operation, all neurologic symptoms disappeared and no recurrence has been observed after 6 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: The pathophysiology of nontraumatic de novo arachnoid cysts has many unknown features, and it appears necessary to accumulate further case reports.

ID VON RECKLINGHAUSENS DISEASE; PATIENT
AB BACKGROUND: Although vascular abnormality is an uncommon comorbidity of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), it is potentially fatal. We present spontaneous hemothorax caused by rupture of a vertebral artery (VA) aneurysm in a patient with NF1.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 36-year-old man with a history of NF1 was transferred to the emergency department with dyspnea. Chest computed tomography scan revealed hemothorax in the left lung field with mediastinal shifting and aneurysmal dilatation of the left VA at the C6 vertebra level. Immediate drainage of the hematoma by chest tube insertion was performed. Diagnostic angiogram showed a 3- to 4-cm fusiform aneurysm of the VA. After the angiogram, cardiopulmonary arrest occurred after a rebleed of the VA aneurysm. The aneurysmal segment of the VA was urgently occluded with detachable coils. Postoperatively, the patient was in intensive care for 1 month because of fulminant pneumonia After the patient regained consciousness, he was found to have right hemiparesis from a small infarction at the pons. The patient's function improved to near normal after 1 year of recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hemothorax caused by VA rupture in a patient with NF1 is an extremely rare condition that can be fatal. Careful examination with suspicion for early detection and treatment is required for this urgent condition. Endovascular coiling was safe even for an unstable patient with massive bleeding.

DE Paraclinoid aneurysm; Type IIIb endoleak; Willis covered stent
ID ANEURYSM REPAIR; COMPLICATION; MANAGEMENT; SAC
AB OBJECTIVE: We report a case of late type IIIb endoleak with Willis covered stent (WCS) developed 14 months after endovascular paraclinoid aneurysm repair.
   METHODS: A 52-year-old woman presented with episodic headache, caused by a giant paraclinoid aneurysm. She underwent a successful 3.5 x 16mm WCS positioning to treat the aneurysm. Fourteen months later, the patient was admitted with the same symptoms. Digital subtraction angiography examination showed recurrence of the aneurysm, which was similar to the preoperative one. DynaCT (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) indicated the intact of the metal structure of the stent without migration. Type IIIb endoleak (defect in the graft fabric) was confirmed with a whole aneurysm neck located in the middle part of the stent. The type IIIb endoleak was treated with another WCS (4.0 x 16mm). The immediate digital subtraction angiography imaging indicated that the endoleak disappeared and the aneurysm was completely occluded. Re-examination done 1 year after the second treatment showed a complete exclusion of the aneurysm sac.
   CONCLUSIONS: Type IIIb endoleaks can be safely treated by the endovascular positioning of another WCS. Continuous surveillance after endovascular paraclinoid aneurysm repair for intracranial aneurysms is warranted to make ensure the safety of WCS.

We describe a patient with ossified CSH and underlying large B-cell lymphoma and discuss the relationship between lymphoma and CSH, emphasizing clinical characteristics, tumorigenic mechanism, and histopathologic analysis.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 46-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse and a frontotcmporoparietal and left frontal ossified CSH that was diagnosed 2 years previously presented with headache and memory loss over 6 days. The patient was being followed with serial imaging, which showed the static state of the mass and no other lesions 7 months before admission. He underwent right frontotemporoparietal craniectomy to remove the ossified CSH and tumor. When the bone was lifted and the thin dura was opened, a hard, thick, ossified capsule was observed. No apparent tumor invasion was noted in the skull or epidural space Despite refusing further chemotherapy and radiation therapy, the patient has been disease-free and working for 5 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on reported cases and relevant literature, large B-cell -phoma limy be associated with ossified CSH.

AB Melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy (MNTI) is a rare pigmented craniofacial tumor of infants. This study aimed to analyze the literature on MNTI arising from the skull and brain. A systematic literature review was performed and 91 patients reported in 78 articles were identified from 1918 to 2019. MNTI of the skull and brain was slightly more prevalent among boys. The age at diagnosis of patients with intracranial MNTI was mainly >1 year, and most patients with skull MNTI were diagnosed within the first year of life (P< 0.001). MNTI of the skull mostly presented as a rapidly growing mass, whereas intracranial MNTI presented with increasing intracranial pressure and neurologic dysfunction. Surgical resection was the primary treatment, with an average follow-up of 25.6 months. Overall survival was related to age at diagnosis within 1 year (P = 0.001), tumor location (P < 0.001), tumor size (P = 0.010), treatment (P < 0.001), and metastasis (P < 0.001) and malignancy (P < 0.001), whereas recurrence rate was significantly associated with age (P < 0.001), tumor size (P = 0.010), complete surgical resection (P = 0.011), metastasis (P = 0.003), and malignant behavior (P = 0.001).

ID SPINE; MANAGEMENT; INJURIES; DISC
AB OBJECTIVE: Besides the facet joints interlocking, the fibrous tissue or bony callus around the dislocated segments make the reduction for this kind of old injury to be more challenging and different from that of acute injuries. This study is aimed to present 4 cases of old subaxial cervical facet dislocations (SCFD) that were successfully treated with posterior unlocking under endoscopy followed by anterior decompression, reduction, and fixation.
   METHODS: Between January 2017 and December 2017, 4 dents with old SCFD who underwent posterior unlocking of facet joints under endoscopy followed by anterior decompression, reduction, and fixation were enrolled. A cervical collar was prescribed for 4 weeks postoperatively. Postoperative follow-up evaluations were conducted at 2, 6, and 12 months, including neck visual analogue scale score and neck disability index, radiography, and computed tomography.
   RESULTS: The operative time averaged 145 minutes (range, 130-155 minutes). No deterioration of neural function, major vessel rupture, or iatrogenic injury to esophagus occurred. Intraoperative blood loss averaged 45 mL (range, 40-50 mL). Hospital stay for all patients was only 4 days. The neck visual analogue scale score and neck disability index were improved at the final follow-up, and interbody fusion was satisfactory without any radiologic sign of instability or internal failure.
   CONCLUSIONS: For patients with old SCFD, the unlocking of facet joints via the posterior approach under endoscopy followed by anterior decompression, reduction, and fixation is an alternative technique.

DT Article
DE Cranioplasty; Custom-made cranial plate; Meningioma; Single-step surgery
ID CRANIOPLASTY; MENINGIOMAS; DESIGN
AB BACKGROUND: Cranioplasty is a common procedure in neurosurgery. However, cosmetic and neuroprotective reconstructions are necessary after cranioplasty. Treatment of patients with a meningioma with bone infiltration requires removal of the tumor-infiltrated bone and subsequent cranioplasty. We report an efficient technique for cosmetic and neuroprotective reconstructions using a custom-made ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene cranial plate (SKULPIO, Kyocera Medical, Kyoto, Japan) in a single-step surgery involving tumor removal and skull reconstruction.
   METHODS: We present 2 illustrative cases of a 49-year-old female with a right frontal convexity meningioma and 69-year-old male with a bilateral parasagittal atypical meningioma, both involving extensive skull invasion. We preoperatively planned craniotomy size to facilitate the removal of the tumor-infiltrated skull bone using the patients' 3-dimensional cranial models followed by the construction of a custom-made cranial plate. After tumor removal, we drilled out the outer table and the diploe of the cranial edge until the custom-made bone plate accurately fit the bone defect. Finally, the cranial plate was fixed using titanium plates and screws.
   RESULTS: Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging for each case revealed total meningioma removal and an aesthetically reconstructed skull. Using this technique, precise adjustment of the cranial edge to the plate contributes to a gapless and aesthetic reconstruction. Furthermore, the intact inner table of the skull firmly supports the custom-made bone plate.
   CONCLUSIONS: This technique involving the placement of a custom-made cranial plate during a single-step surgery was found to be efficient for cosmetic and neuroprotective reconstructions.

AB BACKGROUND: The need for neurosurgical care across the globe remains a public health issue. The creation of sustainable neurological surgery departments and training programs will be indispensable in alleviating the burden of neurological disease in low to middle income countries (LMICs).
   METHODS: We reviewed the history of the neurological surgery department and residency program of Santarem in the state of Para, Brazil, from 1999 to the present. We have described the epidemiology unique to the region and provided evidence of a sustainable practice in a LMIC. The challenges, limitations, and resources were explored.
   RESULTS: We have provided a historical vignette of the evolution of neurological surgery in the Brazilian Amazon, including the creation of a sustainable neurological surgery practice and accredited residency program. In addition, we assessed the neurological surgery burden and epidemiology unique to the region, with an emphasis on the community and indigenous health in this remote area. We also explored the future directions of this example, which could affect the international neurological surgery community.
   CONCLUSION: A sustainable neurosurgery practice and training program is possible in a LMIC. Training neurosurgeons in developing regions of LMICs is a sustainable method to decrease the morbidity and mortality of neurological diseases and prevent the misdistribution of physicians in a country. We encourage adaptation of sustainable neurological surgery practices in similar regions across the world to increase access to necessary neurosurgical care.

AB The Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device, an intrasaccular flow-diverter that does not require long-term antiplatelet use, has recently emerged as an alternative to embolize complex intracranial aneurysms; however, there are limitations to the WEB device. First, it does not immediately secure the aneurysm in most subarachnoid hemorrhage cases. Second, it may not be suitable for embolization of wide-neck aneurysms with an unfavorable aspect ratio. To overcome these limitations, we have used the WEB device in conjunction with stenting and/or coiling. Here, we present a technical note with an illustrated case series and provide a detailed step-by-step description on how the WEB device can be used in adjunct to coiling and/or stenting to achieve successful angiographic results. Accurate sizing of the WEB device before deployment is critical. Larger case series are required to further assess the safety and success of these combined techniques.

ID ISOLATED CEREBRAL MUCORMYCOSIS; INTRACRANIAL MUCORMYCOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Mucormycosis of the central nervous system is an uncommon infection caused by saprophytic or parasitic fungi of the subphylum Mucormycotina and order Mucorales viz. Rhizopus, Mucor, and Rhizomucoz Isolated, chronic involvement of the central nervous system is a rare occurrence. To the best of our knowledge, isolated chronic ventricular involvement in an infant has not been reported previously. Isolated intracerebral mucormycosis is a disease of the immunocompromised patient, and to date only 6 cases have been reported in immunocompetent patients, including 2 pediatric cases.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of an immunocompetent infant presenting with features of increased intracranial tension. He underwent cerebrospinal fluid diversion and was found to harbor mucormycosis on histopathologic examination of intraventricular debris. We also present a brief review of the relevant literature.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although mucormycosis is an acute fulminant infection, chronic isolated cerebral cases are known in the immunocompetent patient. Patients also may present with isolated hydrocephalus, and hence fungal infection must be ruled out in all, especially if a shunt is warranted.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Calcineurin inhibitors; Dural lesion; Meningioma; MRI; Renal transplant
AB BACKGROUND: Patients with a renal transplant are an ever-increasing demographic. Their life expectancy is also on the rise and thus malignancies or tumors in these cases are more frequent. These patients are often on immunosuppressive drugs that are known to cause changes in the microvasculature, especially of the deep white matter. However, benign dural-based lesions are a rarity in these cases with very few (<5) ever being reported. Imaging findings in such cases are altered, which leads to an altered set of differential diagnosis.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a right parasagittal lesion in case of postrenal transplant with imaging findings suggestive of an inflammatory lesion. The lesion was excised and histopathology was that of a fibrous meningioma. Pathological basis of altered imaging is discussed and potential causes elaborated along with a thorough review of similar cases and their findings.
   CONCLUSIONS: Renal transplants and long-term survival are now a reality; calcineurin inhibitors are a staple for these cases. The drugs alter imaging findings and hence cases need to be carefully evaluated with a host of differential diagnosis. Knowledge of these changes is now necessary for these new spectra of cases.

DE Endoscopic fenestration; Hydrocephalus; Multiloculated
ID VENTRICLES; FENESTRATION; CRANIOTOMY
AB BACKGROUND: Multiloculated hydrocephalus (MH) is a challenging pathology for pediatric neurosurgeons, arising from various etiologies including intraventricular hemorrhage, infection, and overshunting. Although previous publications have discussed the potential etiology of this pathological process, including fibroglial webbing, no clear precursor has been proven. We present a case of MH developing after both intraventricular hemorrhage and intraventricular infection, with visualization of the precursor via endoscopy and a confirmed glial scar on pathological examination.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Our patient is an preterm-born (at 24 weeks of gestation) male with a grade III intraventricular hemorrhage treated with reservoir placement and serial taps. He did not develop posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus but presented back at approximately 4 months of age with Escherichia coli meningitis that necessitated multiple interventions for intraventricular abscesses, including an endoscopic exploration. He ultimately developed MH requiring placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
   CONCLUSIONS: MH is a complex pathology with multiple risk factors. To only theories regarding the etiology have been proposed. Our case represents the first known direct visualization of intraventricular fibroglial webbing with magnetic resonance imaging correlation. Improved understanding of the pathophysiology of this entity may improve our ability to treat this pathology before loculations develop.

AB BACKGROUND: Hydrocephalus secondary to spinal cord tumors is rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a 39-year-old male with gradual-onset headache whose initial diagnosis was cerebral aneurysm and communicating hydrocephalus. The correct diagnosis was primary intradural extramedullary malignant melanoma of the spinal cord. Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated slight dilation of cerebral ventricles and a 3-mm unruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm. He was placed under observation therapy. Two months later he was seen again due to severe headache. There was no intracranial hemorrhage on brain computed tomography scans. As we suspected rupture of the aneurysm, we operated on him for surgical clipping; however, there was no aneurysmal rupture. We found no lesions responsible for hydrocephalus, so we placed a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. His headache subsequently resolved. Nine months later he developed gait disturbance; a large volume of ascites was observed. Gadolinium-enhanced lumbar magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intradural extramedullary mass at the L-1 to S-5 level. Cytology and immunohistochemistry of the cerebrospinal fluid and ascites identified a few atypical cells positive for HMB-45, S-100 protein, and Melan-A. Whole-body examinations detected no primary lesions outside the central nervous system. Our final diagnosis was primary intradural extramedullary malignant melanoma of the spinal cord with cerebrospinal fluid dissemination.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that communicating hydrocephalus may be due to primary malignant melanoma of the spinal cord.

TI Transarterial Embolization of Dural Arteriovenous Fistula in Superior
   Sagittal Sinus Under Bilateral External Carotid Artery Flow Control:
   Technical Note
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Balloon; Fistula; Liquid embolic material
ID ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Transarterial embolization (TAE) using liquid embolic material is a standard treatment for non-sinus-type dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF). However, to reach embolic material over a shunt point for complete obliteration of DAVF is often difficult. We present a technical case report of the efficacy of bilateral external carotid artery (ECA) flow control for the TAE of superior sagittal sinus DAVF.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 64-year-old man presented with dizziness and left hemiparesis. Computed tomography imaging showed right parietal subcortical hemorrhage, and cerebral angiography revealed a DAVF in the superior sagittal sinus fed by bilateral occipital artery, bilateral superficial temporal artery and bilateral middle meningeal artery (MMA), with cortical venous reflux and without connection to the superior sagittal sinus. We therefore planned TAE using glue via MMA under bilateral ECA flow control. A 7-Fr balloon guide catheter was positioned in the bilateral ECA origins, and a microcatheter was introduced distal to the MMA. Heated 20% n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate was slowly injected via the left MMA under bilateral ECA origin flow control. The n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate reached the shunt point and obliterated the shunt in a single session. The patient was discharged without neurological symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral ECA flow control using balloon guide catheter is safe and effective for a DAVF in the superior sagittal sinus with multiple and tortuous scalp feeders.

   spine surgery; Revision surgery
ID SEGMENT DEGENERATION; ARTIFICIAL DISC; FOLLOW-UP; LUMBAR
AB BACKGROUND: The occurrence of adjacent-level disease in spinal fusion is a complex and contentious issue. Through the years, surgeons have developed various approaches to address this problem. While some have avoided fusion altogether, others have advocated for large, multilevel fusion constructs. With the advent of minimally invasive spine surgery, there are now novel approaches to the spine which allow for less onerous and morbid revision surgeries. In this paper, we present the case of a woman who previously underwent a posterior cervical fusion and presented with adjacent-level disease.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 63-year-old female who had previously undergone a cervical 5 to thoracic 1 posterior instrumented fusion presented with axial neck pain, hand numbness, and imbalance. Imaging demonstrated adjacent-level disease with anterolisthesis of cervical 4 on cervical 5. Rather than exposing her entire fusion construct, we used a new technique to link her old hardware to new instrumentation.
   CONCLUSIONS: We believe that our case is demonstrative of a new, modularized approach to spinal fusion and suggest a way forward in the treatment of adjacent-level disease.

AB BACKGROUND: Relatively few cases of total en bloc spondylectomy (TES) for L5 tumors have been reported. TES in the lower lumbar region is usually performed through a combined anterior and posterior approach. TES for L5 tumors by a posterior-only approach is technically challenging.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 62-year-old woman with persistent pain in her lumbosacral area and lower extremities and numbness of her lateral left lower extremity for 2 months came to our department. She had undergone radical mastectomy 4 years earlier. X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that the tumor had destroyed the vertebral body of L5. No other lesions were revealed by emission computed tomography (ECT) or positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). With a diagnosis of breast cancer and a solitary metastasis to L5, the patient was treated with posterior-only TES of the L5 tumor and reconstruction The whole procedure took 10 hours, and her intraoperative blood loss was 9000 mL. The lumbar and leg pain of the patient disappeared postoperatively without serious complications. She started walking 4 weeks after surgery and resumed her daily life. New multiple metastases developed 6 months after surgery, with no sign of local recurrence. Despite active treatment, she died 18 months after surgery.
   CONCLUSION: TES of the L5 tumor can be achieved by a posterior-only approach, with good results and limited complications.

   Complication of Elective Craniotomy
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Adult; latrogenic; Incipient; Transcalvarial herniation
ID GROWING SKULL FRACTURE
AB BACKGROUND: Herniation of the brain through an osseodural defect has been well described in small children as an uncommon occurrence after closed head injury. Pressure from the growing brain has been implicated in progressive enlargement and reshaping of the fracture line. An analogous phenomenon in adults has been observed in the described cases where neurosurgical intervention led to a persistent dural defect. Transcalvarial herniation of the brain through the dural defect resulted in characteristic neurologic and imaging findings producing symptoms disproportionately greater than expected from the extent of the affected brain, accompanied by enlargement of the underlying ventricle and elevation of the bone flap. Disruption of the axonal conduction due to distortion of the axons in the herniated brain is probably responsible for these observations.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A series of 3 cases is described. In all cases, the dural reconstitution at the conclusion of surgery was incomplete. Brain herniation was evident in the postoperative scan. The transcalvarial herniation of the brain was precipitated by either a seizure and resultant brain swelling or persistently raised intracranial tension from a tumor residual. In 2 cases, surgical reexploration resulted in improvement in the neurologic symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: In symptomatic patients with transcalvarial herniation of the brain, identified on imaging, the neurologic syndrome is quite characteristic. Recognition of this condition and prompt treatment lead to lasting neurologic improvement.

AB BACKGROUND: Different transforaminal endoscopic r eroaches have been developed for the surgical treatment of lumbar disc herniation: Kambin (intradiscal), Yeung (intraforaminal intradiscal), Ruetten (extreme lateral), transforaminal endoscopic surgical system (intraforaminal extradiscal) approach, and modifications. The operative technique for the treatment of foraminal and extraforaminal lumbar disc herniation through these surgical approaches has not been well described in reported studies. Moreover, each of these surgical approaches has limitations in the removal of migrated intra- or extraforaminal disc herniation. We have described, step by step, the operative technique of a modified percutaneous endoscopic transforaminal approach we have termed the "percutaneous endoscopic intra- and extraforaminal extradiscal approach or transforaminal outside-in outside [TOIO] approach" for the treatment of foraminal and extraforaminal lumbar disc herniation.
   METHODS: From 2012 to 2018, 48 patients had undergone the percutaneous endoscopic TOIO approach for symptomatic foraminal and extraforaminal lumbar disc herniation. The inclusion criteria were the same as the microdiscectomy criteria. The exclusion criteria included patients with severe foraminal stenosis and disc degeneration, listhesis, and scoliosis. The pre- and postoperative clinical data, radiographic findings, and surgical technique were investigated.
   RESULTS: No intraoperative complications developed. the patients showed progressive improvement of initial neurological deficits with complete recovery of motor weakness and L4, L5 hypoesthesia at 1 month postoperatively. One patient experienced persistent postoperative dysesthesia on the affected leg for similar to 1 month.
   CONCLUSION: The percutaneous endoscopic TOIO approach is a minimally invasive, safe, and efficacious surgical procedure for the treatment of lumbar foraminal and extraforaminal disc herniation. Proper patient selection is mandatory to ensure a satisfactory outcome.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Filum terminale arteriovenous fistulae (FTAVFs) are rare entities. For those with the fistulous point located in the lower sacral region (below S2), neither surgical nor endovascular strategies are the optimal treatment.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe 2 FTAVF cases with the fistulous point below S2: one had the anterior spinal artery (ASA) as a single feeder with a long distance to the fistula and the other developed an inaccessible feeder after the initial non-ASA feeder embolization. In a hybrid operating room, through an L4 laminectomy, we surgically exposed and cannulated the cephalad draining vein, other than the feeding arteries, to retrograde occlude the proximal draining vein along with the fistulous point and feeders using Onyx. All shunt points were obliterated with the help of intraoperative digital subtraction angiography.
   CONCLUSIONS: Retrograde embolization of the draining vein to obliterate FTAVFs in the lower sacral region is feasible and complete. This technique may provide a new treatment option for FTAVFs.

AB BACKGROUND: Dislocation of the mandibular condyle into the middle cranial fossa is a rare injury that can be seen after facial trauma. Early identification of condyle dislocation into the middle cranial fossa was difficult until the development of computed tomography, and diagnosis was often significantly delayed after the initial trauma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a rare case of a young woman who presents after a mechanical fall resulting in facial trauma with an avulsion condyle fracture with dislocation of the mandibular condyle into the middle cranial fossa.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this complete avulsion of the condyle into the middle cranial fossa requiring an intracranial approach for condylectomy is extremely rare. We discuss the surgical management options for reduction and fixation accomplished in a multidisciplinary approach involving neurosurgery and oral maxillofacial surgery.

Magnetic resonance imaging showed a heterogeneous mass extending through widened lumbar neural foramina to the psoas muscles bilaterally, with a dumbbell-like appearance. Biopsy led to the diagnosis of a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, an uncommon soft tissue sarcoma of neural origin that may occur in the context of neurofibromatosis type 1 syndrome.

DE Aneurysmal bone cyst; Bone metastasis; Breast cancer; Cystic bone
   lesion; Recurrence of cancer
AB BACKGROUND: Metastatic breast cancer in the bone rarely has a cystic appearance, and while it is common in the orbit, its metastasis to the orbitotemporal skull is rare. Consequently, it is difficult to diagnose it. We report and discuss a rare case of metastatic breast cancer with simple cyst appearance in the orbitotemporal region of the skull.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 63-year-old woman presented with mild double vision only on left gaze that lasted for 2 months. Ten and a half years ago, the patient underwent surgery for tumor resection of a stage 3 breast adenocarcinoma, followed by radiotherapy and administration of anticancer therapy. Thereafter, she continued hormonal therapy with antiestrogen drugs, which was discontinued a half year ago because there was no recurrence during treatment.
   On admission, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a single and simple cystic lesion in the orbitotemporal region of the skull. The cyst was filled with fluid of different intensity, indicative of a hemorrhagic component. Additional gadolinium-contrasted MRI showed no enhancing effects in the lesion. The cyst was totally removed by surgery, and the histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of breast adenocarcinoma. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy was then administered, and the patient started follow-up hormonal therapy with antiestrogen agents. No recurrence in the orbitotemporal region of the skull occurred during 6 months after the surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic breast cancer should be considered in the differential diagnosis even if it appears as a simple cyst in the orbitotemporal bone after long-term remission.

ID PILOCYTIC ASTROCYTOMA; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; CLASSIFICATION; 4TH-VENTRICLE;
   FEATURES
AB BACKGROUND: A rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor (RGNT), a rare brain tumor, presents as a benign feature with a favorable outcome. To date, a few cases with aggressive behaviors, such as recurrence or dissemination, but none with malignant transformation, have been reported. We describe 1 case that recurred as glioblastoma after complete resection of the benign RGNT.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A man aged 58 years presented with headache and dizziness without neurologic symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 4 x 2.5 cm, well-demarcated mass in the left cerebellar hemisphere. The patient underwent gross total resection of the tumor and a diagnosis of RGNT was made. There was no evidence of recurrence on serial follow-up. However, a recurrent heterogeneous enhancing mass in the previous surgical cavity was observed on a 7-year postoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan. Reoperation was performed and a histopathological study revealed a glioblastoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of spontaneous malignant transformation of an RGNT.

AB Cerebral aneurysms (CAs) are characterized by a pathological wall structure with internal elastic lamina and media disruption, which leads to focal weak-ened pouches of the arterial wall. The prevalence of unruptured CAs has been estimated to be 2%-5% in the general population. During the past few decades, the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the formation, growth, and rupture of CAs have been the focus of numerous research studies. In the present review, we have summarized the inflammatory pathways, genetics, and risk factors for the formation, growth, and rupture of CAs. In addition, we have discussed the concepts of geometric indexes, flow patterns, and fluid dynamics that govern CA development.

   RECONSTRUCTION; CONTINENCE; IMBALANCE; ALIGNMENT; BLADDER; BOWEL
AB BACKGROUND: Flat back deformity is a disabling adverse outcome following instrumented lumbar fusion. As patients are often fused in this non-physiologic alignment, correction is complex and has conventionally required fracture of the preexisting fusion mass. Sacral osteotomy may be one effective means of correcting the positive sagittal balance in these patients. Here we report a case of flat back deformity corrected using a 3-column sacral osteotomy, and systematically review the available literature on the effectiveness of 3-column sacral osteotomy for correcting flat back deformity.
   METHODS: A systematic review was performed using results of a search of the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases according to PRISMA guidelines. We also include our patient as an example of the technique.
   RESULTS: Eight studies-all case reports or small case series-were identified describing 37 patients, including our case example. The variety of techniques was too heterogeneous for meta-analysis, but all studies reported good correction of sagittal deformity. Transient L5 palsy was the most common side effect of this technique, being reported in 21 patients (56.8%) across all studies.
   CONCLUSIONS: Sacral osteotomy is potentially an effective means of correcting positive sagittal balance in patients with flat back deformity secondary to high pelvic incidence.

ID SPONTANEOUS CSF LEAKS; EPIDURAL BLOOD PATCH; SUBDURAL-HEMATOMA;
   HEADACHES; PRESSURE
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial hypotension is an underrecognized cause of spontaneous subdural hematoma. Failure to identify this entity and treat the underlying etiology can result in profoundly dangerous clinical consequences, prolonged and costly hospitalization, and caregiver fatigue, as seen in the case presented here.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of intracranial hypotension associated with a spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak in the cervical spine leading to consistently reproducible herniation syndrome with head of bed elevation, and bilateral subdural hematomas as a result of a pressure gradient favoring downward migration of intracranial contents resulting in traction on bridging veins. This gradient promoted transtentorial herniation with resultant brainstem compression, leading to a prolonged intensive care unit stay, recurrent respiratory failure, and severe deconditioning. An exhaustive diagnostic workup uncovered a cervical root CSF leak with a nuclear medicine CSF flow study, which was successfully treated with nerve root ligation and dural closure. The patient recovered well postprocedurally and was able to return to baseline level of function.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates the importance of considering intracranial hypotension in cases of positional herniation syndrome and the necessity for early and aggressive attempts at identifying and treating the underlying cause to prevent unnecessary neurologic dysfunction and protracted medical care.

AB BACKGROUND: A 61-year-old man was admitted complaining of myelopathy and back for 3 months.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 15-mm hemangioma with calcification was noted on magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. Intraoperatively, the mass was hard with ill-defined demarcation. The cranial portion of the mass was brown and dark gray on the dorsal cord. During surgery, motor evoked potentials transiently decreased, but they fully recovered at the end of surgery. After surgery, the patient's symptoms recovered without severe neurologic deficit.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hemangioma calcificans, a variant of cavernous hemangioma with full calcification and ossification, is an extremely rare disease in the spine and brain. Here we report a rare case of intramedullary cavernous hemangioma with calcification of the spinal cord.

ID TRANSVENOUS EMBOLIZATION; ONYX EMBOLIZATION
AB BACKGROUND: Certain cavernous sinus (CS) dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are difficult to access through transarterial or transvenous routes and may necessitate access through direct transorbital puncture of the superior ophthalmic vein (SOV) or the CS. However, to be successful, the accurate design of the puncture route and guidance are crucial. This study aimed to report our preliminary clinical experience using cone-beam computed tomography (CT) with real-time fluoroscopic overlays for image guidance during transorbital needle puncture.
   METHODS: Between December 2017 and July 2018, 3 patients with CS DAVFs were treated via a transorbital puncture to establish access to the CS under the guidance of XperGuide planning software either via direct CS puncture or through the SOV. The guidance trajectory was superimposed onto the real-time fluoroscopic image during needle puncture. Once access was established, the CS DAVFs were treated with a combination of liquid embolic materials and coils.
   RESULTS: Image guidance aided to avoid at-risk structures and treatment resulted in all cases in complete obliteration of the CS DAVFs as verified by control angiography without peri- or postprocedural complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular embolization of CS DAVFs direct transorbital puncture aided by image guidance provided an alternative option when more conventional approaches are deemed not possible.

AB BACKGROUND: To evaluate effectiveness and safety of extended laminoplasty for the treatment of ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) involving the C2 segment.
   METHODS: A total of 132 cases who accepted laminoplasty for treating the OPLL from 2010 to 2015 were included and divided into Group A (n = 26, with C2 OPLL and C2-C7 laminoplasty), Group B (n = 29, with C2 OPLL and C3-C7 laminoplasty), and Group C (n = 77, without C2 OPLL and had C3-C7 laminoplasty). Clinical and radiologic outcomes were compared among the 3 groups.
   RESULTS: At the final visit, significant improvements in japanese Orthopedic Association score, Neck Disability Index, Health-Related Quality-of-Life Short Form 36 Physical Component Summary, and Visual Analog Scale score in neck were observed in all 3 groups. However, all the C2-C7 Cobb angle, C2-C3 Cobb angle, sagittal vertical axis, and number of cases with cervical or segmental kyphosis in the 3 groups were not significantly changed. Although total blood loss, operation time, maximum Visual Analog Scale score in neck, incidence of axial pain, change of C2-C7, or sagittal vertical axis in Group A were all significantly larger than that in Group B or Group C, differences in neurologic recovery rate, Neck Disability Index, Health-Related Quality-of-Life Short Form 36 Physical Component Summary, change of the C2-C3 Cobb angle, and incidence of cervical or segmental malalignment among the 3 groups were not significant at the final visit.
   CONCLUSIONS: If decompression indication for cases with OPLL involving the C2 segment was appropriate, extended laminoplasty up to the C2 segment could provide satisfactory neurologic recovery and would not accelerate cervical or segmental malalignment progression.

   ARTERY; RUPTURE
AB BACKGROUND: Mirror aneurysms represent 2 adjacent arterial protrusions. Although the size is considered a major risk factor in terms of rupture, sometimes it is the smaller aneurysm that ruptures. Here, we present the contemporary management of mirror distal anterior cerebral artery (DACA) aneurysms associated with multiple aneurysms. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis was performed when assessing multiple aneurysms using Hemoscope, version 2015.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Among multiple aneurysms, a mirror A2/A3 DACA aneurysm was found in a single patient. Surgical treatment was provided for all aneurysms through a single-stage procedure. The left ruptured A2/A3 aneurysm was smaller compared with the right (7.5 x 3.5 mm/10.8 x 3.2 mm). CFD showed greater wall pressure (WP) in the left ruptured A2/A3 aneurysm (left A2/A3 WP 84,000-84,402 Inst. mm Hg/right A2/3 WP 84,224-84,315). WP in the left middle cerebral artery and anterior communicating artery aneurysms showed lesser values compared with the ruptured aneurysm (WP upper values 84,361 and 84,367, respectively). Wall shear stress showed low values for all aneurysms with the lowest flow rate values in the left A2/A3 aneurysm.
   CONCLUSIONS: In cases of ruptured mirror aneurysms followed by the presence of intracerebral hematoma, surgery is considered the primary option with the best results. A one-stage dual craniotomy procedure was found safe in the associated treatment of other multiple aneurysms. At present, the size of the aneurysm, the hemodynamic influence, and the local configuration are all considerations during the preoperative assessment of multiple aneurysm cases. According to our knowledge, this article presents the first CFD analysis of mirror DACA aneurysms associated with aneurysm multiplicity.

AB BACKGROUND: Association of moyamoya disease (MMD) with von Wille-brand disease (vWD) is extremely rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We first report a 27-year-old female case of MMD concurrent with vWD type 1, which presented as hemorrhagic stroke. The patient underwent a revascularization surgery with perioperative replacement therapy of von Willebrand factor and coagulation factor VIII. No hemorrhagic complications occurred.
   CONCLUSIONS: The patient overcame postoperative transient neurological events and fully recovered. We discuss appropriate perioperative supplementation of coagulation factors for a revascularization surgery for MMD with vWD.

AB Catastrophic subaxial vertical cervical distraction injury is rare. In this report, we present a 49-year-old male whose dreadlocks were caught in a drill press. His head was spun around, resulting in a degloving and distraction injury. He was unresponsive with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3T. He coded multiple times and underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Computed tomography of the cervical spine showed a 4.8-cm vertical distraction of the spine at the C5-6 level and subglottic tracheal separation. Computed tomography of the head showed diffuse cerebral edema. Despite aggressive resuscitation, he did not survive this catastrophic injury. This is the first report of such subaxial vertical cervical distraction injury from the United States.

AB BACKGROUND: In patients who have failed systemic anticoagulation therapy, various endovascular approaches may assist in emergent recanalization.
   METHODS: We searched the PubMed database from January 1999 to August 2018 for studies that reported endovascular treatment modalities and associated clinical outcomes including recanalization, functional independence, mortality, or intracranial complications. Random-effect models were used to pool estimates across studies using R software.
   RESULTS: Overall, 393 patients with cerebral venous thrombosis from 21 studies were included in the study. Transvenous local chemolysis treatment results were as follows: good outcome rate. 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-0.93), mortality, 0.08 (95% CI, 0.04-0.16), postprocedural hemorrhagic rate, 0.11 (95% CI, 0.06-0.19), and complete recanalization rate, 0.59 (95% CI, 0.48-0.70). Transvenous mechanical thrombectomy results were as follows: good outcome rate, 0.66 (95% CI, 0.41-0.84), mortality, 0.09 (95% CI, 0.03-0.26), postprocedural hemorrhagic rate, 0.03 (95% CI, 0-0.16), and complete recanalization rate, 0.60 (95% CI, 0.35-0.80). Combined approach treatment results were as follows: good outcome rate, 0.80 (95% CI, 0.70-0.87), mortality, 0.10 (0.04-0.22), postprocedural hemorrhagic rate, 0.17 (95% CI, 0.10-0.27), and complete recanalization rate, 0.75 (95% CI, 0.64-0.84). Mixed approach to treatment results were as follows: good outcome rate, 0.61 (95% CI, 0.51-0.70), mortality, 0.23 (95% CI, 0.16-0.32), postprocedural hemorrhagic rate, 0.46 (95% CI, 0.33-0.59), and complete recanalization rate, 0.48 (95% CI, 0.37-0.58).
   CONCLUSIONS: The combination approach treatment tended to have better outcomes, although this meta-analysis did not achieve statistical significance in all outcome parameters. Future studies are needed to establish the best treatment options with tailoring to specific clinical or angiographic scenarios.

AB BACKGROUND: Angiosarcomas are rare malignant tumors of endothelial origin. Nearly one half of all angiosarcomas occur in the head and neck. Temporal bone angiosarcomas are extremely uncommon. We present a case of temporal bone angiosarcoma and a review of the relevant data.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a 20-year-old man with a painful right postauricular mass after a closed head injury. Radiologic studies demonstrated a large right osteolytic and heterogeneously enhancing mass. The patient underwent right transpetrosal craniectomy for resection. Histologic studies confirmed high-grade sarcoma. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated a uniformly positive ERG endothelial marker, CD31 staining with cytoplasmic and membranous patterns of immunopositivity, positive nuclear staining for FLI-1, positive cytoplasmic and membranous staining for CD99 and STATE, and negative smooth muscle actin stains in the neoplastic cells. Ki-67 staining showed similar to 94% positivity in the neoplastic cell nuclei. Postoperative follow-up imaging studies demonstrated evidence of metastatic right cervical lymphadenopathy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Angiosarcoma of the temporal bone is extremely uncommon. In the present case report, we explored a relationship between trauma and angiosarcoma of the temporal bone. We reviewed the reported data regarding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, radiologic findings, and histologic characteristics of angiosarcoma of the temporal bone.

   Stent lumen
ID RESTENOSIS; PLAQUE
AB BACKGROUND: Use of angioscopy to directly observe the stent lumen in the phase after carotid artery stenting (CAS) has not been reported to date. Here we report 3 patients in whom angioscopy helped confirm the stent lumen during retreatment after CAS.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Case 1 required retreatment for stent shortening that occurred 1 month after the first CAS. Preprocedure angioscopy showed the presence of neointima, which could not be revealed by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). In case 2, which required repeat CAS for distal progressive stenosis of the internal carotid artery, the neointima was observed on the stent surface and was more pronounced on the distal side. In case 3, retreatment was necessary for recurrent ischemic stroke caused by stent restenosis; preprocedure angioscopy showed an unstable plaque, which was not detected as vulnerable by IVUS, protruding into the stent lumen, with partial ulceration and bleeding.
   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with IVUS, angioscopy enables a more detailed observation of the stent lumen. Although angioscopy is relatively invasive, its use in evaluating changes in the stent lumen after CAS should be clarified by accumulation of reported cases.

   malformation
ID HEMANGIOMA; ANGIOMA
AB BACKGROUND: Cavernous hemangiomas arising in the extraaxial space are rarely encountered, often mimicking other more common pathologies. Furthermore, multiple coexisting lesions and posterior fossa involvement are scarcely reported. Herein, we present the case of a patient with concurrent frontal bone and posterior fossa extraaxial cavernous hemangiomas. We also review the challenges associated with the diagnosis and management of these entities.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An otherwise healthy 41-year-old gentleman presented with a 7-month history of a progressive right forehead mass. Imaging demonstrated a right frontal bone mass and an incidentally noted transverse sinus- based mass. The patient opted for surgical resection of both lesions. A right frontal craniotomy was performed to remove the bony lesion, followed by a suboccipital approach for the dural-based mass. There were no significant complications intraoperatively, and gross total resection was achieved for both lesions. Final pathology for each was consistent with cavernous hemangioma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Extraaxial cavernous hemangiomas are uncommon clinical entities that are challenging to distinguish from other diseases. If intraoperative complications can be avoided, treatment with surgical resection often offers excellent patient outcomes.

AB Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive form of brain cancer in adults. GBM carries a dismal prognosis because of its proliferative, invasive, and angiogenic capabilities and because of its ability to downregulate the immune system. Immune-based therapies under investigation for GBM have been unsuccessful in vivo because of this downregulation. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is a high-energy state of matter that can be applied directly or indirectly to tumor tissue to serve as an adjunct to immunotherapy in the treatment of GBM because it upregulates the immune system by the induction of reactive oxygen species. CAP has the potential to improve the efficacy of existing and investigative immunotherapies for GBM.

AB BACKGROUND: Chromothripsis is characterized by a multitude of chromosomal rearrangements during a unique cataclysmic event in a cell life. Disintegration of one or several chromosomes is followed by a chaotic rearrangement of generated fragments. It might play a role in oncogenesis and tumor progression. It is observed in 2%-3% of cancers and is rarely reported in benign tumors. We report a case of massive chromothripsis in a fast growing chordoid meningioma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 55-year-old woman was admitted for a meningeal mass developing in the right parietal parasagittal area. She underwent subtotal resection of the tumor. Histologic analysis revealed a chordoid meningioma (World Health Organization grade II). Six months later, magnetic resonance imaging showed a large bilateral tumor recurrence. After a second surgery, the patient received radiotherapy. Thereafter, the clinical course was uneventful. Comparative genomic hybridization showed only a monosomy X in the primary tumor. In the recurrent meningioma, this anomaly was associated with a massive chromothripsis including more than 370 chromosomal abnormalities affecting chromosomes 1-22.
   CONCLUSIONS: Chromothripsis is rarely described in benign tumors and especially in meningiomas. In the presented case, the high number of chromosomal rearrangements and the onset of this phenomenon at a later stage of tumor progression are very unusual. The role of surgical stress on the emergence of chromothripsis and its relation with tumor aggressiveness are discussed.

   DIAGNOSIS; OUTCOMES; TUMOR; CT
AB BACKGROUND: Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXAs) are a rare type of astrocytoma, which, similar to other gliomas, can rarely arise from glial nests in the meninges, manifesting as an extra-axial mass. We describe a solitary extraaxial intracranial primary meningeal PXA in the pediatric age group, which was masquerading as a tentorial meningioma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 9-year-old girl presented with features of raised intracranial pressure. Imaging revealed a dural-based mass in the tentorial region suggestive of a meningioma. This suspicion was further strengthened by intraoperative visualization of an extra-axial tumor with wide tentorial attachment. Near-total excision was achieved. Histopathologic examination established the diagnosis of PXA. Given the tumor's apparent meningeal origin and lack of connection with brain parenchyma in imaging and intraoperative findings, primary meningeal PXA was diagnosed. The absence of coexisting tumor foci on spinal magnetic resonance imaging further refined the diagnosis as solitary extra-axial intracranial primary meningeal PXA. The patient received radiotherapy for the residual tumor and was doing well at 6 months after presentation; however, she was lost to follow-up after that.
   CONCLUSIONS: Solitary extra-axial intracranial primary meningeal PXA is an extremely rare entity with only 3 reported cases in the literature including the present case. This is the first report of such a tumor in a pediatric patient. This report also highlights that primary meningeal PXA can manifest as an extra-axial mass lesion and may warrant inclusion in the differential diagnosis of extraaxial mass lesions.

ID MALIGNANT PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA; PATIENT; DISEASE; GENE
AB BACKGROUND: Pheochromocytoma brain metastasis is extremely rare. Few cases have been reported in the literature. Therefore, diagnosis and effective treatment of these lesions are difficult.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here, we report the case of 29-year-old woman, who was operated on for a right adrenal pheochromocytoma. Fourteen months later, a posterior fossa tumor was diagnosed. Radiologic findings mimicked an extra-axial lesion. The radiologic differential diagnosis was difficult even using magnetic resonance imaging spectroscopy. The patient was operated on through a retrosigmoid approach. Local recurrence occurred 6 months after first surgery. The patient died 1 month later, despite a second operation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the occurrence of brain metastases in pheochromocytoma is not prevalent, patients presenting with suggestive features need to be carefully considered. Magnetic resonance imaging can help in differential diagnosis with a primary brain tumor. There are no established guidelines for the treatment of pheochromocytoma brain metastasis, for which the prognosis remains dismal, despite effective surgery.

ID CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; EXPRESSION; GERMINOMA; LOCATION; FUSION; CD34
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a rare occurrence and involvement of the fourth ventricle rarely reported. Because of its rarity, some characteristics of intracranial SFT seem to still remain uncertain.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This study describes a very rare case of intracranial SFT in a 55-year-old woman who presented with gait disturbance and numbness in bilateral upper limbs from 3 months before visiting the hospital. Head magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed a homogeneously enhancing mass lesion located primarily in the fourth ventricle extending into the spinal canal and left foramen of Luschka, with a maximum diameter of 60 mm. Notably, this tumor presented spontaneous partial regression during waiting planned surgery without therapy, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This patient underwent a midline suboccipital craniotomy and resection of the tumor. Interestingly, there was no attachment to the dura mater of the posterior cranial fossa and the lesion was only attached to the dorsal part of the medulla oblongata.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the location of the SFT in the fourth ventricle is rare, SFT should be considered as 1 of the differential diagnosis of fourth ventricle tumors. In addition, this case indicates that SFT in the fourth ventricle may regress on occasion spontaneously without a precisely known cause for this spontaneous partial regression.

DE Circulating tumor DNA; Droplet digital PCR; Liquid biopsy; Metastasis;
   Spinal myxopapillary ependymoma; TERT promoter mutation
ID CLASSIFICATION; TUMORS
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal myxopapillary ependymoma (SP-MPE) is a subgroup of ependymomas in which after initial gross tumor resection, recurrences occur in more than half of the patients. Anaplastic transformation may also occur and contributes to intraneural and extraneural metastatic dissemination. Extraneural metastases from SP-MPE are rare and worsen the prognosis. In this situation, the noninvasive detection of recurrent somatic mutations in the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from plasma is challenging. Telomerase-reverse transcriptase gene promoter (TERTp) mutation has been identified in a subset of ependymomas with aggressive behavior.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report on a patient with TERTp mutated SP-MPE presenting with an extraneural anaplastic metastatic dissemination after iterative local recurrences. From the initial SP-MPE to pleural anaplastic lesion, TERTp C228T mutation was present with allele frequency varying from 33% to 39%. Interestingly, TERTp mutation was also detected by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction in the plasma with a frequency of 2.1% at the time of pleural metastases, highlighting that ctDNA is released in plasma of patients suffering from SP-MPE with extraneural metastatic dissemination.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite the rarity of this evolution, plasmatic liquid biopsy appears d useful diagnostic and follow-up tool in a subset of primary brain tumors.

DT Article
DE Epidermoid cyst; Hemifacial spasm; Secondary hemifacial spasm;
   Vestibular schwannoma
ID CEREBELLOPONTINE ANGLE; NERVE; CYST
AB BACKGROUND: Hemifacial spasm (HFS), one of the most common hyperactive cranial rhizopathies, is a disorder characterized by spontaneous, intermittent, and repetitive contraction of unilateral facial muscle. The most common cause of HFS is a mechanical compression of the facial nerve at the root exit zone (REZ) by blood vessels located in the brainstem. The incidence of cerebellopontine angle (CPA) tumor-induced HFS ranges from 0.3% - 2.5% of all patients with HFS, and the incidence of epidermoid cyst among such tumors is extremely rare (0.2% to 0.25%). We present a patient manifesting HFS induced by a small epidermoid cyst who underwent Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for ipsilateral vestibular schwannoma (VS) more than 10 years ago.
   CLINICAL DESCRIPTION: A 59-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with HFS. Ten years before admission, the patient underwent GKS for ipsilateral VS. Enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the volume of VS was not increased. Also, no definitive mechanical compression of the facial nerve REZ by blood vessels was detected. We concluded that HFS was secondary to the VS treatment by GKS and decided to operate to remove the tumor and identify REZ. A standardized lateral suboccipital retrosigmoid approach was performed. The cochlear nerve was encased by a tumor mass, and the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) was displaced by the mass. During tumor excision, we ensured that the VS and displaced PICA did not directly compress the REZ. Interestingly, an unexpected lesion was found with a yellowish viscous mass located between the sixth nerve and ventral side of the seventh nerve REZ. After the tumor removal, a small piece of Teflon was inserted between the PICA and REZ of the facial nerve. Postoperatively, the patient experienced no HFS or facial nerve dysfunction. Histopathologic examination of the lesion revealed an epidermoid cyst.
   CONCLUSIONS: We should consider various possibilities for the cause of HFS and review brain imaging meticulously if patients were treated for CPA tumor with GKS a long time ago and the delayed HFS occurred without changes in tumor volume. HFS induced by epidermoid cyst is rare. Therefore it is critical for the neurosurgeon to ensure the absence of any abnormal contact with the REZ of the facial nerve during surgery for HFS induced by CPA tumors.

   PATIENT; PROGRAM; CARE; IMPLEMENTATION; COMPLICATIONS; LENGTH; STAY
AB BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) represents an evidence-based multidisciplinary approach to perioperative management after major surgery that decreases complications and readmissions and improves functional recovery. Spine surgery is a traditionally invasive intervention with an extended recovery phase and may benefit from ERAS protocol integration.
   METHODS: We analyzed the use of ERAS in spine surgery by completing a search using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and the PICOS (Participants, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, Study Design) model through PubMed and Ovid databases to identify studies that fit our search criteria. We assess the outcomes and ERAS elements selected across protocols as well as the study design and internal validation methods.
   RESULTS: A total of 19 studies met the inclusion criteria and were used in our analysis. Patient populations differed significantly across all 4 studies. Reduction in length of stay was reported in 7 studies using the ERAS protocol. Comparative studies between ERAS and non-ERAS show improved pain scores and reduced opioid consumption postoperatively, but no differences in complications or readmissions between groups. Complication rates under ERAS protocols ranged from 2.0% to 31.7%. Significant pain reduction in visual analog scale scores was observed with 3 ERAS protocols. Direct, indirect, and total cost decreases were also observed with implementation of ERAS protocols.
   CONCLUSIONS: A limited cohort of studies with significant variability in patient population and ERAS protocol implementation have evaluated the integration of ERAS within spine surgery. ERAS in spine surgery may provide reductions in complications, readmissions, length of stay, and opioid use, in combination with improvements in patient-reported outcomes and functional recovery.

   Ligamentum flavum cyst; Lumbar spine; Minimally invasive spine surgery
AB BACKGROUND: Cysts of the ligamentum flavum (IF) are rare occurrences, with only a few cases reported in literature. They are a result of age-related degenerative changes in the IF. The cyst compresses the neural elements and causes neurogenic symptoms. Endoscopic resection of the LF cyst has not been described in literature. In this report, we describe our experience with endoscopic resection of an LF cyst in the 13-14 region.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 54-year-old female patient presented with claudication in both lower limbs and evidence on magnetic resonance imaging of a LF cyst in the L3-L4 region compressing the neural elements. The patient underwent full endoscopic resection of the LF cyst through the interlaminar approach from the left side with preservation of facet joints. The postoperative clinical outcomes improved significantly, and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed a complete removal of the cyst.
   CONCLUSIONS: Full-endoscopic resection may be considered as a viable option for treatment of IF cyst in the lumbar region.

AB BACKGROUND: The natural course of syringomyelia is unpredictable. Only a few cases of adults with spontaneous resolution of syringomyelia associated with Chiari malformation type I (CM-I) have been reported. The timing of surgical intervention for syringomyelia remains controversial. The present report has documented a case with the longest medical history of syringomyelia reported, the associated imaging findings over 16 years, the mild symptom progression after the spontaneous resolution of syringomyelia, and a review of the relevant reported data. The natural history of our patient provides a unique view regarding the factors that might lead to the development and spontaneous resolution of syringomyelia.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a 36-year-old woman who had been monitored for 16 years for mild symptomatic CM-I and syringomyelia. After regular follow-up examinations for the initial 10 years, magnetic resonance imaging revealed partial spontaneous resolution of the syringomyelia and unchanged symptoms. However, after 6 additional years of follow-up examinations, her symptoms had mildly progressed, and the size of the syringomyelia had obviously decreased.
   CONCLUSIONS: The findings from our patient suggest that the natural course of mild symptomatic CM-I in adult patients will be benign and nonprogressive. Patients will commonly present with very few or mild symptoms, despite the presence of a large syrinx. It would be reasonable to observe patients with similar mild symptoms and syringomyelia. Surgery will be indicated by the type, severity, and duration of symptoms at the first clinical visit. Periodic follow-up examinations are also essential after spontaneous resolution because the pathophysiology of syringomyelia is incompletely understood and recurrence possible.

DE Aneurysmal bone cyst; Endovascular treatment; Fibrous dysplasia;
   Thrombosed middle meningeal artery aneurysm
ID RUPTURE
AB BACKGROUND: The aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is a rare osteolytic lesion that is associated with osseous disease such as fibrous dysplasia (FD).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 66-year-old woman previously diagnosed with FD presented with suddenly reduced visual acuity. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large osteolytic lesion in the middle cranial fossa that had invaded the left orbit. Although its radiological findings were compatible with an ABC, rotational digital subtraction angiography revealed that this osteolytic lesion was a large middle meningeal artery (MAA) aneurysm. To release the compression force on the optic nerve and confirm the diagnosis, we performed endovascular embolization, followed by surgical removal of the lesion. Histologic examination revealed that the resected lesion met the requirements of a thrombosed aneurysm. No new neurologic deficits appeared after the surgery, and no symptomatic recurrence have been noted during the 6-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case report to show that ABC-like lesions patients with FD could be thrombosed MMA aneurysms. It is thus possible that some lesions previously diagnosed as ABCs were thrombosed MMA aneurysms or included a thrombosed MMA aneurysm. It is therefore important to rule out the presence of a MMA aneurysm when we encounter what appears to be an ABC in the presence of FD.

   ANEURYSM; PATIENT
AB BACKGROUND: Recurrent artery of Heubner (RAH) aneurysms are rare, with only 7 reported cases in the literature to date. In evaluating cerebral aneurysms, cerebral digital subtraction angiogram (DSA) is considered the gold standard and demonstrated the RAH aneurysms in previous case reports. We present a case of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to RAH aneurysmal rupture, with initial DSA misleading, suggesting minor aneurysmal filling of a presumed thrombosed A1 segment aneurysm instead.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 71-year-old female presented with sudden-onset severe headache, nausea, and vomiting. Computed tomography along with computed tomography angiogram revealed a left-sided subarachnoid hemorrhage and a 5-mm aneurysm arising from either the left A1 or distal internal carotid artery. In addition, complex anterior cerebral artery anatomy with trifurcation was noted. This along with partial aneurysmal thrombosis made identification of the anatomy difficult on subsequent DSA, though a residual neck was still suggested to be arising from A1. Intraoperatively, the aneurysm was found to be arising from the RAH instead and was successfully secured by clipping.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the risk of RAH aneurysms masquerading as emanating from the A1 segment on DSA. Case particularities of complex anatomy and aneurysmal thrombosis were contributory. Other factors such as severe vasospasm, microaneurysms, and aneurysmal compression by overlying hematoma or brain parenchymal swelling could also distort DSA interpretation. These are important considerations in treatment planning by neurovascular surgeons and endovascular neuroradiologists.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Elderly; Lower cervical spine; Osteochondroma
ID SOLITARY OSTEOCHONDROMA
AB BACKGROUND: Osteochondroma rarely occurs in the lower cervical spine in elderly patients, because it usually develops during skeletal growth and because of the limited mobility and lower stress in the lower cervical spine.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 63-year-old man complained of 3-month history of neck pain and a hard, palpable mass in the lower cervical spine. Plain radiography, computed tomography (CT) scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a bony mass arising from the left C5 transverse process with a medullary continuation and calcification and soft tissue displacement at the C4-C6 level. After the operation, the biopsy finding was consistent with osteochondroma, without malignant degeneration. We performed en bloc resection of the tumor, including the cartilaginous cap. The patient's symptoms improved after resection of the osteochondroma and demonstrated no recurrence of tumor at a 1-year follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: This patient had a rare involvement of the transverse process without neurologic symptoms. Multiple imaging modalities, including plain radiography, CT, and MRI, play important roles in the diagnosis of osteochondroma. Complete surgical excision, including the cartilaginous cap, achieved a satisfactory surgical outcome and prevented possible recurrence.

AB INTRODUCTION: Alcohol intoxication is often present concurrently with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Recent studies have looked at the effect alcohol has on TBI and on coagulopathy. Typically, cases reviewed in the current literature report only on the effects of modest alcohol intoxication.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 43-year-old male presented to the trauma center after a fall, with rapidly deteriorating mental status. Computed tomography of the head demonstrated a 1.9-cm acute subdural hematoma. Of note, classical coagulation studies were normal, hut blood ethanol level was high, 436 mg/dL. Post-operatively, the patient suffered an intracerebral hemorrhage requiring emergent return to the operating room, where a large volume of unclotted blood and clinical coagulopathy was encountered.
   DISCUSSION: We review the literature pertaining to coagulopathy in the context of TBI and ethanol intoxication. This case is a cautionary tale of a phenomenon of unmeasured coagulopathy in the face of severe alcohol intoxication manifested by intraoperative coagulopathy with new postoperative hemorrhage. Although routine preoperative testing indicated normal clotting function, a thromboelastogram demonstrated delayed clot formation. The protective effects of alcohol are well described; however, we believe that there is a population of patients with severe acute intoxication who have coagulopathy that may go undetected by routine preoperative screening.
   CONCLUSIONS: Caution should be exercised when taking care of patients with very high levels of alcohol because physiologic derangements may be unpredictable. Additional research is needed for patients with very high levels of alcohol intoxication and the effect it may have on coagulation.

   FEATURES; INSTITUTION; SURVIVAL; SERIES
AB BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), which refers to any malignant tumor that originates from peripheral nerve sheath cells, is rarely found in the spine. Primary intraosseous spinal MPNSTs are extremely uncommon; in fact, such an occurrence has been reported in a very limited number of cases hitherto. We report here one case of low-grade intraosseous MPNST in the lumbar vertebrae and review clinical research related to this rare tumor and modus operandi to its treatment.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 51-year-old man suffering from lower back pain was initially diagnosed with lumbar tuberculosis. The intraoperative histopathologic examination, however, revealed that the occupying lesion was synovial sarcoma when surgeons intended to perform a debridement surgery of what was thought to be tuberculosis. The operation was therefore suspended. Two months later, the patient was referred to our institution. The pathologic sections were reexamined. Its results refuted the earlier thought of being synovial sarcoma, and a final diagnosis of MPNST was made. In addition, preoperative examination revealed that the tumor had advanced rapidly to the adjacent inferior vena cava and pedicle, which ruled out the possibility of performing a total en bloc spondylectomy. Therefore, a marginal resection for 2-level consecutive lumbar vertebrae was performed successfully via an anterior-posterior combined approach. No serious complications were detected at 18-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative biopsy is of great importance for the diagnosis of spinal tumors. Marginal resection of a complicated intraosseous spine MPNST via an anterior-posterior combined approach, despite being technically challenging, resulted in good survival and functional outcomes.

DT Article
DE Dislocation; MCA aneurysm; Repositioning; WEB device
AB BACKGROUND: Intrasaccular flow disruption has emerged as a useful modality for treatment of wide-necked saccular aneurysm at vessel bifurcations. The Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device is one such device that has been evaluated in several series with excellent safety and good midterm efficacy. Bailout techniques to retrieve or reposition a dislocated WEB device are sparse and associated with significant risks. We describe a case of a dislocated WEB device that was repositioned with a microcatheter alone.
   METHODS: We describe a case of a WEB device that inadvertently detached in the parent vessel and the technique we used to reposition it. A number of bailout techniques are discussed with pros and cons associated with each maneuver.
   RESULTS: An unruptured middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm was treated by endovascular embolization with a WEB device. The WEB was deployed within the aneurysm without incident. However, the device failed to detach. While attempting to resheath the device, it extruded out of the aneurysm and then inadvertently detached in the MCA. After many options were considered, a microcatheter alone was used to push the device back into the aneurysm.
   CONCLUSION: Caution should be exercised, especially when detaching the WEB device. Microcatheter repositioning by pushing the dislocated device may be attempted, especially if part of the device is within the aneurysm. This is the first description of the described microcatheter repositioning rescue maneuver.

ID MENINGITIS
AB BACKGROUND: Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt infection, which is 1 of the most important complications of VP shunt is observed at a rate of 4%-17%. Staphylococcus epidermtdis is the most common causative agent. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) is an increasingly common nosocomial pathogen that rarely causes central nervous system infections globally. Current treatment options that have shown appreciable activity against various VRE infections include daptomycin, linezolid, inquinupristin/dalfopristin, and tigecycline. Daptomycin has a particular mode of action and a potent bactericidal activity, making it a useful addition to the clinician's antibiotic collection. Global surveillance data indicate <1.0% rates of daptomycin resistance in enterococci.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here, we describe, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of successful Intraventricular plus intravenous use of tigecycline to treat VP shunt infections caused by daptomycin resistant VRE faecium.
   CONCLUSION: Tigecycline is a life-saving option in the treatment of resistant nosocomial infections but it has not yet been approved for use and there are not enough data in terms of dose and side effects associated with its use in children.

DE Angioplasty; Bilateral carotid occlusion; Ischemic stroke; STA-MCA
   bypass
AB BACKGROUND: Superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass may be used to augment cerebral blood flow in patients with select cerebrovascular pathologies or after failed attempts at revascularization. In this article we describe the use of balloon angioplasty to boost the flow of the external carotid artery (ECA) including the STA to be later used as a donor artery for a STA-MCA bypass procedure.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 67-year-old male with bilateral carotid artery stenosis presented 2 days after a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke and was admitted for medical management. Over the next 4 days his examination worsened; magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography perfusion confirmed a right MCA stroke with penumbra and angiography revealed complete occlusion of the right internal carotid artery within a prior carotid stent. There was also a right ECA stenosis at its origin, thus limiting options for traditional extracranial-intracranial bypass. Therefore the patient underwent balloon angioplasty of the right ECA by traversing the carotid stent followed by right STA-MCA bypass, resulting in increased flow, clinical stability, and improved cerebral perfusion.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights a unique strategy for the management of internal carotid artery occlusion in combination with an ipsilateral ECA stenosis. We also demonstrate the utility of endovascular adjuncts to open vascular surgery when complex patterns of stenosis or occlusion exist.

AB BACKGROUND: Vascular tumors of the spine range from benign hemangiomas to malignant angiosarcomas. Hemangioendotheliomas of spine are tumors of intermediate-grade malignancy with rare occurrence in the intradural location. The imaging and histopathologic features may mimic other common lesions occurring at this location.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 70-year-old woman presented with lower limb weakness and sensory impairment along the L5-S1 dermatome. A radiologic diagnosis of neurofibroma at the intradural location of the L4-L5 level was made, and total excision of the space-occupying lesion was done. Histopatho logic examination, however, revealed a vascular tumor consistent with hemangioendothelioma, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. We present this case discussing the dilemmas and difficulties in arriving at the diagnosis, highlighting the role of immunohistochemical aid.
   CONCLUSION: Histomorphology, aided by ancillar tests like immunohistochemistry, remains the criterion for the definitive diagnosis of such rare lesions, and pathologists need to be aware of these lesions occurring in uncommon locations.

ID SURGICAL APPROACH
AB OBJECTIVE: Two-dimensional radiologic images of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations are insufficient to provide three-dimensional conception of intracranial or spinal lesions, especially for an inexperienced neurosurgeon. We share our experience of applications of volume rendering (VR) images of CT and MRI studies of brain and spine for the purpose of training and surgical planning in neurosurgery.
   METHODS: Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine viewer software was used on a personal computer/laptop to view CT and MRI examinations of various lesions of brain, spine, and spinal cord. Various user-friendly applications of the software enable users to edit the images acquired.
   RESULTS: Imaging technique (CT and MRI) incorporating continuous or overlapping slice with slice thickness of 1 mm with zero gap provides adequate three-dimensional image quality on personal computer/laptop acquired by VR. It was especially helpful for assessment of lesions of the skull base, intracranial vessels (aneurysm and arteriovenous malformation), craniovertebral junction and contrast-enhancing lesions of the brain. Displaying VR images in the operating room as per the patient's head position orients the surgeon to identify various structures in the surgical field.
   CONCLUSIONS: VR is underused in neurosurgery. It enables inexperienced neurosurgeons to understand morphologic details of a lesion and important osteoneurovascular structures around it. It is also helpful for training and preoperative planning in selected patients in neurosurgery.

   MANAGEMENT; RESISTANCE; SECONDARY
AB BACKGROUND: Symptomatic slit ventricle is one of the most challenging complications of shunt surgery in children. Clinical signs and symptoms may appear with a wide range of intracranial pressure (ICP) values. We report the case of a 10-year-old girl, who did not present the classic clinical features of extremely elevated ICP, which was proven by multiple invasive ICP recordings, performed during shunt revisions.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: At the age of 6 months, the patient presented squeal for many hours, accompanied with sunset eyes, bulging anterior fontanel, and dilated ventricles of all 4 ventricles on computed tomography scan. Acute ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion was performed with adjustable valve. During the following 9 years, she was regularly seen and medically treated for intermittent headache, with nausea and vomiting. From 9 years of age, she was hospitalized for severe (10/10 on the visual analog scale), unbearable headache, agitation, and screaming on multiple occasions. Altogether, we had to revise the shunt system 5 times throughout 1 year. Radiologic imaging always showed narrow ventricles. Ophthalmologic examination of the fundus never revealed signs of raised ICP. Perioperative monitoring of the ICP with intraparenchymal sensor showed unexpected high values of 40-45 mm Hy. However, repetitive shunt revisions were successful only temporarily because the symptoms always returned. Only bilateral shunting of the ventricular system was able to eliminate the symptoms permanently.
   CONCLUSIONS: Images of slit ventricle can be associated either with low or extremely high ICP needing urgent surgical consideration, including ICP monitoring. Bilateral shunt insertion can be effective treatment for slit ventricle syndrome.

ID C1 ARCH PRESERVATION; FORAMEN MAGNUM; ODONTOIDECTOMY
AB BACKGROUND: Syringobulbia is an uncommon lesion that occurs in the central nervous system; it is often defined as a pathologic cavitation in the brainstem. The cases with partial blockage of the cerebrospinal fluid pathways at the level of the foramen magnum are more common and the most important group. The most common treatment of syringobulbia is craniovertebral decompression.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This paper reports a case of a symptomatic syringobulbia in which an urgent endoscopic endonasal approach to the craniovertebral junction (CVJ) was done to limit bulbo-medullary compression and rapid neurologic deterioration. A 69-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of acute onset of dysphonia, dysphagia, imbalance, and vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a cystic lesion in the brainstem, suggestive of a syringobulbia in Klippel Feil syndrome with CVJ stenosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case report details the successful use of endoscopic endonasal anterior decompression to treat syringobulbia, and adds to the growing literature in support of the endonasal endoscopic approach as a safe and feasible means for decompressing the craniocervical junction, even in the setting of urgency. However, prudent patient selection, combined with sound clinical judgment, access to instrumentation, and intraoperative imaging cannot be overemphasized.

   REAPPRAISAL; DIAGNOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Angioleiomyoma (ALM) is a soft tissue neoplasm rarely described in the intracranial site. Because of their uncommon presentation, atypical neuroradiologic and pathologic features, ALMs are often misdiagnosed.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe the neuroradiologic, clinical, and pathologic data of a 37-year-old male patient suffering from a tentorial ALM. He was admitted at our hospital because of a posterior cranial fossa mass. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a left tentorial tumor, hypointense on T1-weighted sequences, with heterogeneous contrast enhancement after gadolinium injection ("salt-and-pepper" fashion) and slightly hyperintense signal on T2-weighted sequence. After surgery, pathological examination showed a tumor composed of several thick-walled blood vessels mixed with a population of deeply eosinophilic spindle-shaped smooth muscle cells arranged in bundles. Necrosis was absent. Neither cellular pleomorphism nor mitoses were detected. lmmuno-histochemical analysis confirmed the smooth muscle phenotype of the spindle cell component: diffuse and strong positivity for alpha-smooth muscle actin, desmin, and h-caldesmon. Based on both morphologic and immunohistochemical findings, a diagnosis of primary intracranial ALM was rendered.
   CONCLUSIONS: We add to the literature the tenth case of this exceedingly rare tumor and submit that ALM should be suspected when a tentorial mass with a "flame-like" time-dependent pattern of contrast enhancement on MRI, a "salt-and-pepper" post-contrast appearance on MRI T1-weighted sequences, and a relation with large intracranial feeding vessels are present.

DT Article
DE Clival hemangioma; Endoscopy; Pediatrics; Radiotherapy; Skull base
ID CAVERNOUS HEMANGIOMA; INTRAOSSEOUS HEMANGIOMA; SKULL
AB BACKGROUND: Hemangiomas are benign blood vessels tumors that represent less than 1% of all the bone neoplasms. Calvarial hemangiomas are mainly solitary lesions commonly located in the frontal and parietal bone; however, they may occur in any skull region. These tumors increase in size over a period of months to years before they start showing their first symptoms such as headache, bone deformity, and pathological fractures. Differential diagnosis with osteosarcoma should be considered. Surgical resection with a safety margin is a standard treatment of the cranial hemangioma. Furthermore, radiotherapy has proven to stop the tumor's growth but not its size.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We treated an 11-year-old male who had a rare case of a capillary hemangioma located in the clivus bone. The patient underwent 2 endoscopic endonasal resection because of tumor recurrence. Surgical safety margins are highly recommended, but this procedure could not he performed because of the tumor's location. After the second relapse, the oncology team decided to initiate radiotherapy. At 6-month follow-up, the tumor reduced its size and remained unchanged.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical safety margins are highly important to prevent recurrence in this type of bone tumors. Skull base hemangiomas are a big challenge when you want to achieve these safety margins. We believe that a combined treatment of surgery and radiotherapy should be considered as the main treatment.

TI Investigating the Gender Pay Gap in Industry Contributions to Academic

LA English
DT Article
DE Academic success; Faculty; Gender; Industry funding; Neurosurgery
ID SUNSHINE ACT; PAYMENTS
AB BACKGROUND: A large gender gap exists in industry funding for academic neurosurgeons. Selection criteria for funding distribution remain unclear. However, academic rank, scholarly productivity, and experience have been suggested as determining factors.
   METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of industry payments to US academic neurosurgeons. We used online faculty listings to determine academic rank and gender, then used the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Open Payment Database to identify industry contributions. Details were collected on H-index and length of time in practice was used as a proxy for experience.
   RESULTS: Of the 1481 academic neurosurgeons included, men were in the majority (91% vs. 9%, P = 0.0001). Relative to their male colleagues, female assistant and associate professors received fewer payments (4 vs. 8, P = 0.0040; 2 vs. 7, P = 0.0067) at lower median values ($409 vs. $437, P = 0.0490; $163 vs. $260, P = 0.0089). H-index was more strongly associated with general payment receipt for women academic neurosurgeons (r = 0.20, P = 0.0201) than men academic neurosurgeons (r = 0.06, P = 0.0301). Experience trended toward a significant association with industry funding in men (r = 0.05, P = 0.0601). After adjustment for scholarly productivity and experience, gender-based funding inequalities became insignificant.
   CONCLUSIONS: In academic neurosurgery, substantial gender disparities exist in industry payments and metrics of academic success. There may be an industry selection bias toward recruitment of key opinion and thought leaders, as identified by scholarly productivity and experience. Despite the objective gender inequalities, industry funding to academic neurosurgeons appears to be equitable when metrics of academic success are considered.

   FOLLOW-UP; CAROTID ANEURYSMS
AB BACKGROUND: Despite widespread use of flow diverters, wide-necked large and giant aneurysms are still treated with other techniques as well. A contemporary review of results from different endovascular treatments is timely.
   METHODS: A literature review of the English language literature since 2011 was conducted using PubMed and Science Direct. Keywords and Medical Subheadings included large and giant aneurysms, ruptured aneurysms, aneurysms located in posterior circulation, and aneurysm occlusion status. Case reports were excluded. A combined model was built including both flow diverter and coil treatments in addition to separate models. Efficacy and safety were pooled using random effects analysis and regression.
   RESULTS: The review comprised 29 studies. For coiling techniques, complete occlusion was 40.2%-82.8%, and adjusted regression resulted in 53% (95% confidence interval [CI] 22%-81%). Flow diverter complete occlusion rate was 40.5%-87.8%, and adjusted regression resulted in 87% (95% CI 76%-93%). Overall occlusion rate for both techniques combined was 62%-75%, and adjusted regression resulted in 81% (95% CI 68%-89%). Overall stroke and death regression rate was 5% (95% CI 3%-10%); flow diverters showed slightly higher rates than coiling (6% vs. 3%).
   CONCLUSIONS: All current treatments of large and giant wide-necked aneurysms have comparable safety and efficacy with a trend of superiority of efficacy toward flow diverters. Results of future treatment options and devices can be compared with current technology to evaluate feasibility.

AB OBJECTIVE: Spondylotic cervical myelopathy is a severe condition commonly affecting aging people. Although many investigations have been conducted, a consensus on the best surgical management is still missing. The aim of our study was to systematically review the pertinent literature and carry out a meta-analysis to compare the clinical and radiological outcome of the anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) and the posterior laminoplasty.
   METHODS: This study was conducted in agreement with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines statement. Different medical database (PubMed, Embase, Scopus) were screened for eligible scientific reports. The key words "cervical," "spondylosis," "myelopathy," "laminoplasty," "ACDF" (MeSH) have been used in any possible combination. As outcome variables, the Japanese Orthopedic Association score, operation time, blood loss, cervical lordosis, range of motion and, complications were evaluated.
   RESULTS: A total of 626 articles were screened and 5 finally included in the meta-analysis. Comparing the anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) and laminoplasty groups, no differences were found in Japanese Orthopedic Association score, operation time, and complication rate. The ACDF was associated with lower intraoperative blood loss and better cervical lordosis preservation, whereas the laminoplasty was associated with a wider cervical range of motion.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this meta-analysis seem to suggest that ACDF should be preferred to the laminoplasty for the treatment of multilevel cervical myelopathy, although proper designed randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to further investigate this relevant ongoing issue.

We identified 430 reports for screening. The hazard ratios (HRs) of the preoperative and postoperative parameters from Z3 separate multivariate regression analyses were pooled using a meta-analysis of the proportions.
   RESULTS: Of the 430 reports, 12 satisfied the criteria for inclusion in the present study. The pooled population of 5681 patients with meningioma had a median age of 56 years (range, 50-61) and a median proportion of World Health Organization grade I of 91% (range, 66-100). From these data, 4 statistically significant, independent predictors of postoperative seizures were identified: 1) preoperative seizure history (HR, 3.53; P< 0.01), 2) non-skull base location (HR, 2.35; P< 0.01), 3) postoperative complications (HR, 3.95; P < 0.01), and 4) meningioma recurrence (HR, 3.69; P < 0.01). However, the certainty of these results ranged from low to moderate.
   CONCLUSIONS: We identified 4 significant independent predictors of postoperative seizures after meningioma resection. These parameters should be considered in the follow-up of these patients to ensure optimal seizure surveillance, although ultimate validation by prospective studies is still required.

TI Isolated Trochlear Nerve Palsy it a Patient with Superior Cerebellar
   Rete Mirabile
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Rete mirabile; Superior cerebellar artery; Trochlear nerve palsy
ID ARTERY; 4TH; ETIOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND: Rete mirabile is a very rare vascular malformation and superior cerebellar artery (SCA) rete mirabile is not reported previously. We report a new case of rete mirabile of SCA initially detected by magnetic resonance imaging and transfemoral cerebral angiography.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This report illustrates the case of a 58-year-old man who presented with vertical diplopia. Brain magnetic resonance angiography and transfemoral cerebral angiography revealed a rete mirabile of SCA and 3-dimensional volume isotropic turbo spin echo acquisition, brain magnetic resonance imaging sequence, demonstrated that the cisternal segment of the ipsilateral trochlear nerve was compressed by this vascular malformation. We assumed that his cranial nerve palsy was caused by the rete mirabile of the right SCA. During the 8 weeks presence of diplopia, the patient was observed and the symptom was relieved spontaneously.
   CONCLUSIONS: We provide a first report in the literature of rete mirabile involving the SCA and suggest a descriptive knowledge of rete mirabile for clinicians during decision-making of treatment.

DE Headache; Spontaneous intracranial hypotension
ID CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID LEAKS; MISDIAGNOSIS; FEATURES
AB BACKGROUND: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is uncommon. There is lack of understanding of its exact pathophysiology along with significant variability in its clinical management.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The authors report the case of a previously well man cervicogenic headache associated with magnetic resonance imaging features of intracranial hypotension. The salient features of this case include the details of various treatments prescribed for his condition and the therapeutic difficulties encountered.
   CONCLUSION: Owing to the infrequency of the diagnosis, the challenges of clinical management for this patient are discussed in relationship to current literature. Next, the highlights of this unusual case in an individual add to the growing body of literature reports for better understanding of this disease.
