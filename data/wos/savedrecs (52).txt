AB As the pharmaceutical industry modernizes its manufacturing practices and incorporates more efficient processing approaches, it is important to reevaluate which process design elements affect product quality and the means to study these systems. The purpose of this work is to provide insight on a methodology to correlate the effect of raw material properties to equipment and process performance using both data-driven and semi-empirical models. In this work, lubricated blends of pharmaceutically-relevant materials were made using varying levels of magnesium stearate, ranging from 0.25 to 1.5%. Materials characterization (e.g., compressibility, permeability, density, particle size) was performed for all materials and blends. The blends were compressed using a two by three experimental design, varying tablet fill cam depth and tablet thickness, respectively. Tablet properties (e.g., weight, tensile strength, and thickness) were collected for all tablets. Using the collected tablet property results, models coefficients for the semi-empirical Kuentz and Leuenberger equation, which relates the tablet tensile strength to changes in porosity, were regressed. Empirical models were then developed to correlate the values of the Kuentz and Leuenberger equation coefficients to the blend material properties. The empirical models were then used in conjunction with the Kuentz and Leuenberger equation to evaluate the compression design and operational space, accounting for material properties. This proof of concept work aimed at developing correlations between raw material properties and unit operation models can aid process development, especially in design space characterization and robustness analysis.

AB Different regulatory guidelines recommend establishing stability profile of pharmaceuticals at the time of drug development. The expiry date, retesting period and storage conditions of active drugs or products are established through stability analysis. Several regulatory guidelines exist for stability testing of pharmaceuticals. Mostly, ICH stability guidelines are followed in practice. This guideline recommends to validate stability indicating method using forced degradation samples that contains all possible degradation impurities. ICH guidelines provide general recommendations for inclusion of stability indicating parameters in a stability testing protocol. However, those guidelines do not provide specific requirements and experimental methodology to be followed for stability studies. Due to this gap, often confusion arises in the scientific community in designing stability testing protocol. Therefore, significant variations are observed in reported literature in selection of stability indicating parameters. Procedural dissimilarity amongst reported stability studies is also evident. This review discusses the regulatory guidelines and procedures to follow in performing stability testing of pharmaceuticals. Scope of this review also includes recommendations on practical approaches for designing stability testing protocol to fulfill current regulatory requirements for drug substances and their formulations.

AB 3D-printed tablets are a promising new approach for personalized medicine. In this study, we fabricated composite tablets consisting of two components, a drug and a filler, by using a fused deposition modeling-type 3D printer. Polyvinylalcohol (PVA) polymer containing calcein (a model drug) was used as the drug component and PVA or polylactic acid (PLA) polymer without drug was used as the water-soluble or water-insoluble filler, respectively. Various kinds of drug-PVA/PVA and drug-PVA/PLA composite tablets were designed, and the 3Dprinted tablets exhibited good formability. The surface area of the exposed drug component is highly correlated with the initial drug release rate. Composite tablets with an exposed top and a bottom covered with a PLA layer were fabricated. These tablets showed zero-order drug release by maintaining the surface area of the exposed drug component during drug dissolution. In contrast, the drug release profile varied for tablets whose exposed surface area changed. Composite tablets with different drug release lag times were prepared by changing the thickness of the PVA filler coating the drug component. These results which used PVA and PLA filler will provide useful information for preparing the tablets with multi-components and tailor-made tablets with defined drug release profiles using 3D printers.

AB Afoxolaner is a drug belonging to the isoxazolines' family, and it is recommended for ectoparasite control in dogs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of afoxolaner in the treatment of otodectic mange in naturally infested cats. Sixteen cats were divided into two groups (treated and control). The treated group (n = 8) underwent a single oral presentation of afoxolaner at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg. The control group (n = 8) received no antiparasitic treatment. The detection of mite infestations were performed by video otoscopy before the medication, 48 h after the medication and at weekly intervals up to 35 days after treatment (+ 7, + 14, + 21, + 28, + 35). In the treated group, the animals were negative for the presence of the mite 48 h after the medication and throughout the evaluation period. The control group remained positive throughout the experiment, demonstrating 100% efficacy (p < 0.05) for the treated cats naturally infested with Otodectes cynotis in a single dose over a period of 35 days. The animals were reintroduced into their natural habitat, allowed to regain contact with other cats and then reassessed for possible reinfestation. It was found that afoxolaner was effective in the treatment of otodectic mange the animals presented no adverse reaction to the use of afoxolaner.

AB It is agreed that exposure of adult dairy cattle to helminths on pasture can negatively affect production performances as milking herd. Young animals, especially replacement heifers, represent the future of a dairy farm and are among the most vulnerable to helminth infections in a dairy herd. For this reason, dairy farmers tend to frequently treat heifers against helminths, although the impact of helminths on heifers' production performances is still poorly understood. Using different epidemiological and serological tools, this study examines the relationship between heifer exposure to helminths on pasture and production performances over time. During a one-year period, 1,454 individual milk samples were collected from first-lactation heifers in England and tested for Ostertagia ostertagi (O. ostertagi) antibodies. After controlling for other confounders, increasing milk antibody levels against O. ostertagi were significantly associated with decreased milk yield at sampling but not at day 305 of heifer lactation. We did not observe any relationship between milk antibody levels against O. ostertagi in heifers and yields in fat and protein. However, heifers with a high level of milk antibodies against O. ostertagi were more likely to produce dead calf at first calving and present a delay in second calving. Moreover, these heifers had significantly higher levels of milk antibodies against Mycobacterium paratuberculosis (M. paratuberculosis) during their first lactation and were more likely to die before the end of the study. We argue that epidemiological approaches can be useful but must be complemented by other methodologies to better understand the impact of helminth infections in dairy heifers. In order to address the complex dynamics of helminth infections in dairy cattle production we require more comprehensive approaches that include triangulation between data sources and interdisciplinary studies.

AB Reliable methods for detection of A. galli infection using excreta egg count (EEC) and ELISA assays to determine A. galli specific IgY levels in serum and yolk samples were compared from hens infected naturally and artificially. Artificially infected hens were used to generate samples for analysis of preferred detection methods and to generate contaminated ranges for use in the naturally acquired infection study in which Lohmann Brown hens (n = 200) at 16 weeks of age were randomly assigned to four treatments with five replicate pens. Hens of negative control (NC) ranged on a decontaminated area, hens of low infection, medium infection and positive control (PC) ranged on the areas previously contaminated by hens artificially infected with 250, 1000 and 2500 A. galli eggs/hen, respectively. Additionally, hens of PC were orally infected with 1000 A. gall eggs/hen. Anti A. galli antibody levels in hen serum (SIgY) and yolk (YIgY) were measured before range access, and 2, 7 and 12 weeks after access to the contaminated ranges. In a natural infection study, eggs were detected in the excreta of all hens 4 weeks after range access, with the exception of NC in which no eggs were detected. EEC increased to reach maximum value (2204 307 eggs/g) after 11 weeks of range access and then declined at 12 weeks (905 +/- 307eggs/g) (p < 0.01). While SIgY OD values were not different in hens between any groups before range access, after 2 weeks, both SIgY and YIgY gradually increased in hens of PC (1.17 +/- 0.03 and 0.88 +/- 0.04) and medium infection (1.07 +/- 0.03 and 0.96 +/- 0.04) compared to low infection (0.38 +/- 0.03 and 0.29 +/- 0.04) (p < 0.01) and NC. After 12 weeks, SIgY were similar in hens of PC, medium and low groups whereas YIgY was higher in hens of low infection group (p < 0.01). Sensitivity of the serum and egg yolk antibody levels assay to detect A. galli infection was 100% and 96%, respectively, whereas the pooled EEC method yielded a sensitivity of 93%. The results of this study suggest that hens naturally infected with A. galli produce both SIgY and YIgY at different levels depending on the infection intensity and duration of exposure which allows the diagnosis of prior infection or early diagnosis of current infection. Use of the practical and non-invasive method of yolk sample analysis for detecting IgY can be just as informative as using serum samples to detect A. gall infection.

AB Breeding sheep for enhanced resistance to gastrointestinal parasites is a promising strategy to limit the use of anthelmintics due to the now widespread resistance of parasites to these molecules. This paper reports the genetic parameters estimated for parasite resistance and resilience traits in the Blond-faced Manech dairy sheep breed and the putative impacts of the selection for resistance to gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) on farms. Two datasets were used. First, the rams of the selection scheme were artificially infected twice with L3 Haemonchus contortus larvae. Faecal egg counts (FEC) and packed cell volume (PCV) loss were measured 30 days after each infection. Secondly, the FEC, PCV and body condition score (BCS) (1-6 measures per ewe) of naturally infected ewes on farms were measured in the spring, summer and autumn over a two-year period. Genetic parameters were estimated for each dataset independently but also globally based on the pedigree connections between the two datasets. For the experimentally infected sires, the FEC following the second infection was moderately heritable (heritability: 0.35) and strongly correlated with FEC after the first infection (genetic correlation: 0.92). For the naturally infected ewes, FEC was also heritable (0.18). Using the two datasets together, a genetic correlation of 0.56-0.71 was estimated between the FEC values of the experimentally infected rams and naturally infected ewes. Consequently, the genetic variability of parasite resistance is similar whatever the physiological status (males or milking/pregnant ewes) and the infection conditions (experimental infection with one parasite or natural infection with several parasites). In practice, when the sire population is divided into two groups based on their genetic value, the FEC of the ewes born to the 50% most resistant sires is half that of the ewes born to the 50% most susceptible sires. Our study shows the feasibility and efficiency of genetic selection for parasitism resistance based on the sires' FEC records to improve parasite resistance in naturally grazing ewes. For breed improvement, and to increase the selection pressure on parasite resistance, it seems more appropriate to measure FEC values on rams after experimental infection rather than on ewes in natural infection conditions because this limits the number and standardizes the conditions of FEC measurements.

AB The trematodes of the genus Philophthalmus are eye flukes that cause damage to ocular structures of animals and humans. Despite the increasing number of cases reported in birds, studies related to the diagnosis of subclinical philophthalmosis are lacking, and there are no effective therapeutic regimens available. In the present study, we evaluated the diagnosis and treatment of philophthalmosis in specific pathogen-free chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) experimentally infected with Philophthalmus gralli. Four chickens were inoculated with metacercariae of P. gralli (20 per eye) obtained from cercariae emerged from naturally infected Melanoides tuberculata. From 90 days post-infection, the chickens were subjected to direct ophthalmic examination (DOE) and conjunctival sac lavage (CSL). The latter technique consisted of lavage of each eye with 200 mu L sterile saline solution and subsequent microscopical examination of the collected fluid for the presence of eggs of P. gralli. The anthelminthic treatment protocols included praziquantel (PZQ) at 10, 50, or 100 mg/kg (single dose given intramuscularly), or fenbendazole (FBZ) at 50 mg/kg (three doses at 24 h-intervals given per os). The treatment protocols were performed at 14 day-intervals between each dosage of PZQ. Chickens developed a minimum of one to more than five adult P. gralli per eye, except for one chicken that had a single eye with one parasite. No ocular clinical signs or changes in behavior were noted in any chickens. DOE and CSL were considered techniques with similar sensitivity for the diagnosis of avian philophthalmosis. The data suggested that PZQ and FBZ, at the dosages and schedules employed, are not effective for the complete elimination of P. gralli. CSL is proposed as a complementary technique for the diagnosis and monitoring of philophthalmosis post-treatment, especially in sub clinical cases. The evaluation of new protocols, routes of administration, and anthelmintic drugs are needed for successful pharmacological treatment of philophthalmosis.

AB Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato, a dog tapeworm is a species complex causing cystic echinococcosis or hydatid disease in a great variety of mammalian intermediate hosts, including humans. This complex comprises five species including Echinococcus ortleppi (G5 genotype or cattle strain). In the present paper, we report the first case of infection with the larval stage of latter cestode in a captive crested porcupine (Hystrix cristata), molecularly confirmed by PCR and sequencing of the cox1 and nad1 genes. The food contaminated with the parasite's eggs is the most likely source of the infection. Our data broaden the knowledge on the host range and geographical distribution of this rarely reported species of Echinococcus in Europe.

AB The activity of high doses of three insect growth regulators (IGRs), lufenuron (MATCH((R))), pyriproxfen and hydroprene (Gentrol((R))), were tested on Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus adult females, eggs and larvae. Different concentrations of the IGRs were tested on eggs, larvae and adult ticks through immersion, larval packet and adult immersion bioassays, respectively. The tested IGRs did not show adulticidal activity against female ticks even at very high concentration. However, both hydroprene and pyriproxfen caused a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in the reproductive indices of adult female ticks. Both lufenuron and pyriproxefen showed considerable ovicidal activity delaying the hatchability of the treated eggs until the 21st day and decreasing the hatchability percentages to 37.7% and 60.6% at concentrations >= 10X and >= 4X, respectively. Lufenuron (>= 10X dose), hydroprene (>= 4X dose) and pyriproxyfen (>= 4X dose) induced highly significant larvicidal activity as they caused 100% mortality after 72 h of exposure. The oxidative profile of the hydroprene treated ticks had decreased glutathione peroxidase and increased malonaldehyde in comparison to the other IGR- treated and control untreated ticks. It is concluded that the IGRs did not show R. annulatus adulticidal effect, however, the deposited egg mass and its hatching percent decreased significantly when treated with hydroprene and pyriproxfen. The tested IGRs showed larvicidal activity against R. (B.) annulatus.

AB The study compared the pharmacokinetic (PK) behaviour and anthelmintic efficacy against susceptible and resistant nematodes following subcutaneous (SC) and oral administration of ivermectin (IVM) to cattle. Six commercial farms were involved: Farms 1 and 2 (IVM-susceptible nematode population) and Farms 3, 4, 5 and 6 (IVM-resistant nematode population). On each farm, forty-five calves naturally infected with gastrointestinal (GI) nematodes were randomly allocated into three groups (n = 15): untreated control, IVM SC administration, and IVM oral administration (both at 0.2 mg/kg). PK assessment (plasma and faeces) was performed on Farm 1. Efficacy was determined by Faecal Egg Count Reduction Test. IVM systemic availability upon SC administration (421 +/- 70.3ng.d/mL) was higher (P < 0.05) compared to the oral treatment (132 +/- 31.3 ng.d/mL). However, higher (P < 0.05) faecal IVM concentrations were observed following oral treatment (9896 +/- 1931ng.d/mL) compared to SC administration (4760 +/- 924 ng.d/mL). Similar (91-93%) IVM efficacy was observed on Farms 1 and 2 by both routes. Efficacy against resistant nematodes was slightly higher on Farms 3 and 4 after the oral (63 and 82%, respectively) compared to the SC (36 and 68%, respectively) treatment. However, there was complete therapeutic failure (0% efficacy) on Farm 5 and a very low response on Farm 6 (40 and 41% for SC and oral administration, respectively). Although larger faecal concentrations following IVM oral administration may increase drug exposure of GI adult worms, this does not always improve efficacy against resistant nematodes. The potential therapeutic advantages of oral treatments should be cautiously assessed, especially in presence of anthelmintic resistance.

AB The water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) is important to the economy of several countries in Asia, and South America and there are also isolated herds in Europe. In India, buffalo is the main dairy animal. Coccidiosis due to Eimeria is an important cause of diarrhea in livestock worldwide. Eimeria species are generally considered host specific. More than 11 Eimeria species are considered common in buffaloes and cattle (Bos taurus, Bos indicus). Of the numerous species of Eimeria in cattle, Eimeria bovis, Eimeria zuernii, Eimeria auburnensis and Eimeria alabamensis are considered pathogenic in cattle, but there is no report of their pathogenicity in naturally infected water buffaloes. Instead, Eimeria bareillyi has been documented to be the main pathogenic species in buffalo; it is not transmissible to cattle. There are many reports of Eimeria infections in water buffaloes, scattered in many local journals, and there are conflicting life cycle data on Eimeria species in buffalo. The objective of this paper is to summarize information on history, validity of Eimeria species, life cycle, pathogenicity, prevalence, epidemiology, diagnosis and control of coccidiosis in buffalo.

AB There is considerable confusion concerning validity of Eimeria species in equids, and endogenous developmental stages and pathogenicity of equid Eimeria. This paper summarizes worldwide information on history, structure, life cycle, pathogenicity, prevalence, epidemiology, and diagnosis of Eimeria infections in equids. The following conclusions were drawn. Although three species of Eimeria; E. solipedum, E. uninugulata, and E. leuckarti were named from horses, only E. leuckarti is a valid species infecting equids, including horses, donkeys and zebra. We consider E. solipedum, E. uninugulata and Isospora sp.as spurious/contaminants with coccidia from other hosts. E. leuckarti oocysts are distinctive, dark brown and up to 94 pm long and up to 79 pm wide. Its gametogonic stages and oocysts are present in the lamina propria of small intestines. In equids naturally infected with E. leuckarti, only sexual stages have been confirmed. In most of the approximately 50 cases of histologically diagnosed cases of E. leuckarti infection, this infection was considered coincidental or of no clinical relevance. However, in some cases E. leuckarti was considered pathogenic, causing diarrhea and enteritis. The prepatent period is long, 30-37 days or more in experimentally infected equids. Natural infections have been found in 4 week-old foals, indicating that foals can become infected on the day of birth. The number of oocysts excreted is not correlated with clinical signs.

AB To prepare temperature and pH dual-responsive drug delivery systems, the thermosensitive polymer poly(Nisopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) was first synthesized by free-radical polymerization. It was then co-dissolved with the pH-sensitive polymer Eudragit(R) L100-55 (EL100-55) and processed into fibers using electrospinning. Ketoprofen (KET), a model drug, was also incorporated into the composite fibers, and fibers based on a single polymer additionally prepared. The fibers had smooth cylindrical morphologies, and no obvious phase separation could be seen. Using X-ray diffraction, KET was determined to be present in the amorphous state in the fiber matrix. FTIR spectroscopy also indicated the successful incorporation of amorphous KET in the fibers. In vitro drug release studies in media at different pH (4.5 or 7.4) or temperature (25 and 37 degrees C) showed that the release of KET from the blend PNIPAAm/EL100-55 fibers was dependent both on environmental temperature and pH, reflecting the dual-responsive properties of the fibers. The MTT assay was used to explore the biocompatibility of the PNIPAAm/EL100-55 composite fibers towards L929 fibroblasts. Viability was always found to be > 80%, even at polymer concentrations of 100 mg/L. Therefore, the fibers prepared here could lead to the development of multi-responsive materials for drug delivery and tissue engineering.

AB Spray-dried protein formulations commonly require stabilising excipients to prevent protein degradation during processing and storage, and trehalose has been commonly used. The purpose of this work was to evaluate melibiose in spray-dried protein formulations in comparison to trehalose. The protein-activity-preserving efficacy, process behaviour and storage stability were studied. Spray drying of beta-galactosidase was carried out using different process temperature, drying air flow and feed liquid atomisation settings. Both melibiose and trehalose reduced protein activity loss during drying. A decrease in activities was observed when the process temperature exceeded a threshold temperature. During storage (30 days at 18% RH and 20 or 40 degrees C), the formulations dried below this threshold temperature showed no further activity loss, and the stabilising efficacy of the two disaccharides was equal. With higher process temperatures, the remaining protein activities after storage trended higher with melibiose formulations. All formulations remained amorphous. The powder yields of melibiose formulations were similar to trehalose. There was a difference in residual moisture contents, with melibiose formulations giving drier products. In conclusion, protein formulations with melibiose could be spray dried into amorphous powders that were physically stable, contained lower moisture contents and protected protein activity at least as well as trehalose formulations.

AB Amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) are a promising formulation strategy to increase both the apparent aqueous solubility and bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs. Upon dissolution under nonsink conditions, ASDs can generate highly supersaturated drug solutions which can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and/or crystallization. In this study, the phase behavior of supersaturated solutions generated by antisolvent addition and upon the dissolution of ASDs was evaluated using fluorescence lifetime measurements and several other orthogonal techniques, including steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, ultraviolet (UV) extinction and concentration profiles, ultracentrifuge measurements and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Ritonavir and lopinavir were chosen as poorly water-soluble model drugs, and the polymer, Kollidon VA64, was selected to form the dispersions. The fluorescence lifetime of the environment-sensitive fluoroprobe, PRODAN, was monitored to determine the occurrence of LLPS and crystallization. It was found that only the 10% w/w drug loading ASDs dissolved to a concentration in solution higher than the LLPS concentration and this led to an increase in the lifetime of PRODAN due to partitioning of the fluoroprobe into the drug-rich phase. In contrast, the 50% w/w drug loading ASDs did not reach the amorphous solubility, pointing to a dissolution behavior controlled by the low water solubility and high hydrophobicity of the drug. Fluorescence lifetime measurements were demonstrated to be extremely useful for the characterization of the phase behavior of supersaturated solutions of poorly water-soluble drugs.

AB Conducting polymers such as polypyrrole (PPy) can be used as electrically responsive drug delivery systems typically prepared by electrochemical polymerisation, however, the amount of drug that can be delivered is typically low. To increase drug delivery capacity and prepare larger amounts of polymer, PPy nanoparticles were produced by chemical polymerisation over drug-loaded micelles. Two forms of dexamethasone were included to increase total drug loading and to explore the mechanisms of loading and release. The particles produced were approximately 50 nm in size and their conductivity and reversible redox activity were demonstrated. Loading of the hydrophobic dexamethasone base was more efficient than for the more hydrophilic phosphate salt. After pressing the particles into the desired form, electrically-responsive drug release was achieved with a pulsed potential signal being the most effective way to trigger release. Notably, the anionic phosphate salt of the drug was more sensitive to electrically stimulated release than the uncharged base of dexamethasone, highlighting the role of electrostatic forces in driving drug release. This system has potential to be loaded with different drugs widening the scope of application of these smart particles to treat a range of disease states.

AB Piroxicam crystallises into two polytypes, alpha(1) and alpha(2), with crystal structures that contain identical molecular layers but differ in the way that these layers are stacked. In spite of having close structural similarity, the polytypes have significantly different powder tabletting behaviour: alpha(2) forms only weak tablets at low pressures accompanied by extensive capping and lamination, which make it impossible to form intact tablets above 100 MPa, while alpha(1) exhibits superior tabletability over the investigated pressure range (up to 140 MPa). The potential structural origin of the different behaviour is sought using energy-vector models, produced from pairwise intermolecular interaction energies calculated using the PIXEL method. The analysis reveals that the most stabilising intermolecular interactions define columns in both crystal structures. In alpha(2), a strongly stabilising interaction between inversion-related molecules links these columns into a 2-D network, while no comparable interaction exists in alpha(1). The higher dimensionality of the energy-vector model in alpha(2) may be one contributor to its inferior tabletability. A consideration of probable slip planes in the structures identifies regions where the benzothiazine groups of the molecules meet. The energy-vector models in this region are geometrically similar for both structures, but the interactions are more stabilising in alpha(2) compared to alpha. This feature may also contribute to the inferior tabletability of alpha(2).

AB Entecavir (EV), an anti-viral agent for hepatitis B infection, should be administered under fasted state, as intestinal absorption of this hydrophilic compound is markedly decreased under post-prandial conditions. Herein, in order to improve therapeutic adherence, a parenteral sustained delivery system was constructed, by synthesizing water-insoluble ester prodrugs of the nucleotide analogous with fatty acids. EV-3-palmitate (named EVP), exhibited the lowest solubility in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4, 1.1 mu g/ml), with extended release profile compared with EV, EV-3-myristate, and EV-3-stearate, was selected as a candidate to formulate drug suspension. The crystalline suspension was fabricated using anti-solvent crystallization technique, with a mean particle size of 7.7 mu m. After subcutaneous (SC) injection in beagle dogs (0.43 mg/kg as EV), the plasma concentrations of EV were markedly protracted with lowered maximum plasma concentration (C-max, 4.7 ng/ml), extended time required to reach C-max (T-max, 9.0 days), and lengthened elimination half-life (T-1/2,T- 129.3 h) compared with those after oral administration (0.0154 mg/kg, C-max, 15.4 ng/ml; T-max, 0.01 days; T-1/2, 4.1 h). The systemic exposure of the lipidic prodrug was below 0.1% compared with that of EV following SC injection, denoting that EV-P was rapidly converted into the parent compound in blood. Therefore, SC delivery of EV-P microsuspension can be an alternative to oral EV therapy, offering prolonged pharmacokinetic profile after single injection.

AB One major advantage of continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing over traditional batch manufacturing is the possibility of enhanced in-process control, reducing out-of-specification and waste material by appropriate discharge strategies. The decision on material discharge can be based on the measurement of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) concentration at specific locations in the production line via process analytic technology (PAT), e.g. near-infrared (NIR) spectrometers. The implementation of the PAT instruments is associated with monetary investment and the long term operation requires techniques avoiding sensor drifts. Therefore, our paper proposes a soft sensor approach for predicting the API concentration from the feeder data. In addition, this information can be used to detect sensor drift, or serve as a replacement/supplement of specific PAT equipment. The paper presents the experimental determination of the residence time distribution of selected unit operations in three different continuous processing lines (hot melt extrusion, direct compaction, wet granulation). The mathematical models describing the soft sensor are developed and parameterized. Finally, the suggested soft sensor approach is validated on the three mentioned, different continuous processing lines, demonstrating its versatility.

AB This study reports novel food-grade granules for co-delivery of L. plantarum 299v and a standardized extract of Olea europaea leaves (Phenolea((R))) as oral carrier of probiotics and hydroxytyrosol. Different granule formulations containing either L. plantarum 299v (Lac), or the olive leave extract (Phe) or their combination (Lac-Phe) have been successfully produced through wet granulation employing excipients generally regarded as safe as granulating/binding agents. L. plantarum cells withstood the manufacturing process and were stable upon storage at 4 C-degrees for more than 6 months. In vitro dissolution studies in simulated gastro-intestinal fluids showed the capability of the granules to rapidly dissolve and deliver both olive leave phenols and living L. plantarum cells. In simulated digestion conditions, Lac and Lac-Phe granules protected L. plantarum against the harsh environment of the gastro-intestinal tract. Co-administration of Lac and Phe oral granules to healthy mice provided for higher amounts of hydroxytyrosol in urines as compared to Phe granules alone, suggesting that L. plantarum 299v boosted in vivo conversion of oleuropein to hydroxytyrosol. On the other hand, PCR-assisted profiling of the Lactobacillus population in faeces obtained from mice treated with Lac or Lac plus Phe confirmed that the probiotic arrived alive to colon and was there able to exert a sort of perturbing effect on the climax colonic microflora. Overall, these results pave the way towards the development of a nutraceutical useful for combined delivery of bioactive hydroxytyrosol and probiotics to colon site.

AB RNA interference has tremendous potential for cancer therapy but is limited by the insufficient potency of RNAi molecules after i.v. administration. We previously found that complexation with PLL(30)-PEG(5K) greatly increases the potency of 3 '-sterol-modified siRNA [Chol-siRNA] in primary murine syngeneic 4T1 breast tumors after i.v. administration but mRNA suppression decreases 24 h after the final dose. We hypothesized that complexation of cholesterol-modified Dicer-substrate siRNA (Chol-DsiRNA) in place of Chol-siRNA can increase the potency and duration of suppression by polyplexes of PLL(30)-PEG(5K) in solid tumors. We found that replacing Chol-siRNA with Chol-DsiRNA increased polyplex loading and nuclease protection, suppressed stably expressed luciferase to the same extent in primary murine 4T1-Luc breast tumors under the current dosage regimen, but maintained suppression similar to 72 h after the final dose. The kinetics of suppression in 4T1-Luc over 72 h, however, were similar between DsiLuc and siLuc after electroporation and between polyplexes of CholDsiLuc and Chol-siLuc after transfection, suggesting that Chol-DsiRNA polyplexes increase the duration of mRNA suppression through differences in polyplex activities in vivo. Thus, replacing Chol-siRNA with Chol-DsiRNA may significantly increase the duration of mRNA suppression by polyplexes of PLL(30)-PEG(5K) and possibly other PEGylated polycationic polymers in primary tumors and metastases after i.v. administration.

AB In a number of applications, especially in pharmaceutical drug development, there is often a very small powder quantity available for evaluating the manufacturability of new drugs. However, it is highly desirable to be able to quickly evaluate processing issues, and where possible using the smallest powder quantity. In the present work, a proprietary commercial powder dispersion device (the disperser of Malvern(C) Morphologi G3) is adapted to evaluate the triboelectric charging tendency. A very small powder quantity (as small as 0.1 mg) is dispersed by a pressure pulse of compressed gas such as air or nitrogen. This causes the particles to become air borne and collide with the containing walls, resulting in dispersion and leading to triboelectric charge transfer between the particles and the walls. In this work, the charging propensity of a number of materials is evaluated and the effect of particle surface functional groups on the tribo-electric charge transfer is analysed. Model materials with a well-defined shape (glass ballotini) but with different silane groups deposited on their surfaces as well as a number of organic crystalline particles (such as aspirin, alpha-lactose monohydrate and paracetamol) are tested. Following dispersion the particles move immediately to a Faraday cup placed directly underneath the disperser. Therefore, particle charge is measured with no decay. The method can differentiate charging of different polymorphs of the same material, different silane groups on the surfaces of glass ballotini and different crystal morphologies obtained from crystallisation from various solvents.

AB As the life expectancy of the world population increases, osteoporotic (OP) fracture risk increase. Therefore in the present study a novel injectable thermo-responsive hydrogel loaded with microspheres of 17 beta-estradiol, microspheres of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) was applied locally to regenerate a calvaria critical bone defect in OP female rats. Three systems were characterized: Tetronic((R)) 1307 (T-1307) reinforced with alginate (T-A), T-A with PRGF and T-A-PRGF with microspheres. The addition of the microspheres increased the viscosity but the temperature for the maximum viscosity did not change (22-24 degrees C). The drugs were released during 6 weeks in one fast phase (three days) followed by a long slow phase. In vivo evaluation was made in non-OP and OP rats treated with T-A, T-A with microspheres of 17 beta estradiol (T-A-beta E prepared with PRGF (T-A-PRGF-beta E), T-A-beta E with microspheres of BMP-2 (T-A-beta E-BMP-2) and the combination of the three (T-A-PRGF-beta E-BMP). After 12 weeks, histological and histomorphometric analyzes showed a synergic effect due to the addition of BMP-2 to the T-A-beta E formulation. The PRGF did not increased the bone repair. The new bone filling the OP defect was less mineralized than in the non-OP groups.

AB Hemoglobin (Hb)-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) coated with a lipid bilayer (LB-MSNs) were investigated as an erythrocyte mimic. MSNs with a large average pore size (10 nm) act as a rigid core and provide a protective environment for Hb encapsulated inside the pores. The colloidal stability of Hb-loaded MSNs was enhanced upon the application of a lipid bilayer, through fusion of PEGylated liposomes onto the exterior surface of Hb-loaded MSNs. The morphology and mesostructure of the MSNs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and surface area analysis. The Hb loading capacity (mg/g) in MSNs was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy revealed that Hb inside MSNs had an identical, but slightly broadened peak in the Soret region compared to free Hb. Furthermore the encapsulated Hb exhibits similar peroxidase-like activity in catalyzing the oxidation of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) with hydrogen peroxide. The introduction of a supported lipid bilayer (LB) demonstrated the potential to prevent premature Hb release (the burst release decreased from 25.50 +/- 0.33% to 6.73 +/- 0.83%) and increased the colloidal stability of the Hb-loaded MSNs (hydrodynamic diameter remained similar to 250 nm for at least one week). The in vivo systemic circulation and biodistribution of LB-MSNs were studied in optically transparent zebrafish embryos, revealing that LB-MSNs have the potential to act as an erythrocyte mimic in transfusion therapy.

AB Gliomas are the most common malignant brain tumor, but treatment is limited by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), especially for chemotherapeutic drugs. Although some chemotherapy drugs can pass through the BBB, many of these agents are toxic to normal brain tissue. To maximize therapeutic effects, chemotherapeutic drugs must accumulate at the glioma site. In this study, a specific ligand (the RVG29 peptide) that can combine with acetylcholine receptors was conjugated to polyethylene glycol-modified poly-(D,L-lactideco-glycolide) (PEG-PLGA) to develop a targeted carrier; preparation of the targeted docetaxel nanoparticles (DTX-NPs) was performed by the nanoprecipitation method. The NPs were approximately 110 nm and had smooth surfaces. Enzyme-linked immunoassay results showed that the amount of receptor on the surface of glioma cells was 2.04-fold higher than that of nonmalignant cells, which may promote accumulation of RVG29-modified NPs at the targeting site. NPs showed targeting properties for glioma cells compared with the non-targeting NPs in an in vitro cellular uptake test. Targeted NPs also showed better BBB penetration in an in vitro model. In vivo tests indicated that RVG29-PEG-PLGA-NPs could selectively accumulate in intracranial glioma tissue. In conclusion, these results indicated that the RVG29-modified NPs have potential efficacy for glioma therapy.

AB During the development of parenteral dosage forms, different physicochemical studies are required to ensure stable, effective and safe formulations. The osmolality of this kind of dosage forms should bear a close similarity to the body fluids to prevent local irritation, pain or even more significant side effects like endothelial damage. The osmotic studies performed in Polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400), Polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG 4000), Poloxamer 407 (P407), Sodium Hyaluronate (SH), Chondroitin Sulphate Sodium (CS), Cremophor RH 40 (CRE40) and Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) aqueous solutions, showed that the theoretical determination of the osmolality based on their molecular weight as the only determinant factor did not agree with the values obtained by the measurement of colligative properties such as the freezing point depression. The data obtained from this study and its analysis, provided predictive equations that can be used as tools in the primary development to estimate formulation's osmolality at different concentrations; and its evolution over a period at the hypothetical worst-case scenario of storage temperature.

AB In this work we report the effect of stabilizer choice and concentration on nanoparticle (NP) stability over time. Three different BCS class II active pharmaceutical ingredient (APIs): itraconazole (ITR), ketoconazole (KETO) and posaconazole (POS) were chosen due to their poor aqueous solubility and closely related chemical structures. Polyethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol methyl ether and polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DMPEG) with a molecular weight of 2000 Da were included as stabilisers. NPs were formed in situ using an anti-solvent addition, bottom up method at 25 degrees C. Colloidal stability was monitored using dynamic light scattering (DLS), accompanied by morphological examination of the NPs using scanning electron microscopy. Kinetic modelling indicates nanoparticle growth is driven by Ostwald ripening (OR). The presence of DMPEG causes OR growth to become an interface controlled process following a parabola trend. DMPEG encourages OR for POS NPs whilst driving the crystallisation process. The rate of OR appears to be inherent of the crystallisation pathway by which these APIs proceed. Crystallisation mechanisms are API, stabilizer type and concentration dependent. DLS is suitable as an initial systematic screening method for stabilizer selection, aiding the pharmaceutical scientist in the optimisation of nano-formulations.

AB The aim of this work was to obtain an intranasal delivery system with improved mechanical and mucoadhesive properties that could provide prolonged retention time for the delivery of risedronate (RS). For this, novel in situ forming gels comprising thermo-responsive star-shaped polymers, utilizing either polyethylene glycol methyl ether (PEGMA-ME 188, Mn 188) or polyethylene glycol ethyl ether (PEGMA-EE 246, Mn 246), with polyethylene glycol methyl ether (PEGMA-ME 475, Mn 475), were synthesized and characterized. RS was trapped in the selected gel-forming solutions at a concentration of 0.2% w/v. The pH, rheological properties, in vitro drug release, ex vivo permeation as well as mucoadhesion were also examined. MTT assays were conducted to verify nasal tolerability of the developed formulations. Initial in vivo studies were carried out to evaluate anti-osteoporotic activity in a glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis model in rats. The results showed successful development of thermo-sensitive formulations with favorable mechanical properties at 37 degrees C, which formed non-irritant, mucoadhesive porous networks, facilitating nasal RS delivery. Moreover, sustained release of RS, augmented permeability and marked anti-osteoporotic efficacy as compared to intranasal (IN) and intravenous (IV) RS solutions were realized. The combined results show that the in situ gels should have promising application as nasal drug delivery systems.

AB Pharmaceutical powders can exhibit markedly different tablet ejection forces. The purpose of this study is to understand the factors leading to the variability of the tablet ejection force and its sensitivity to lubrication. The study showed that the tablet ejection force is mainly governed by 1) tablet diameter and thickness, 2) compactdie wall friction coefficient, and 3) residual die wall stress upon ejection; the latter was further controlled by the maximum compression pressure, as well as the degree of non-elastic deformation during compression. Brittle powders, such as lactose or dicalcium phosphate, often exhibit exceeding ejection force because of their significant contribution from the non-elastic deformation during loading. These conclusions were verified through compaction experiments of five pharmaceutical powders with diverse compaction properties. Additionally, we found that boundary lubrication was highly effective in reducing tablet ejection force, achievable through decreasing the compact-die wall friction coefficient, but not through altering the intrinsic consolidation behavior of powders. High ejection force is indicative of the sub-optimal stress condition of the tablet post-unloading. Therefore learnings from this study are beneficial for practitioners to harness the ejection force as an effective metric to identify and mitigate risks of tablet defects.

AB Particle detection and analysis techniques are essential in biopharmaceutical industries to evaluate the quality of various parenteral formulations regarding product safety, product quality and to meet the regulations set by the authority agencies. Several particle analysis systems are available on the market, but for the operator, it is quite challenging to identify the suitable method to analyze the sample. At the same time these techniques are the basis to gain a better understanding in biophysical processes, e.g. protein interaction and aggregation processes. The STEP-Technology((R)) (Space and Time resolved Extinction Profiles), as used in the analytical photocentrifuge LUMiSizer (R), has been shown to be an effective and promising technique to investigate particle suspensions and emulsions in various fields.
   In this study, we evaluated the potentials and limitations of this technique for biopharmaceutical model samples. For a first experimental approach, we measured silica and polystyrene (PS) particle standard suspensions with given particle density and refractive index (RI). The concluding evaluation was performed using a variety of relevant data sets to demonstrate the significant influences of the particle density for the final particle size distribution (PSD). The most challenging property required for successful detection, turbidity, was stated and limits have been set based on the depicted absorbance value at 320 nm (A320 values). Furthermore, we produced chemically cross-linked protein particle suspensions to model physically "stable" protein aggregates. These results of LUMiSizer((R)) analysis have been compared to the orthogonal methods of nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and micro-flow imaging (MFI). Sedimentation velocity distributions showed similar tendencies, but the PSDs and absolute size values could not be obtained.
   In conclusion, we could demonstrate some applications as well as limitations of this technique for biopharmaceutical samples. In comparison to orthogonal methods this technique is a great complementary approach if particle data e.g. density or refractive index can be determined.

The fractal kinetics approach leading to release profiles described by a Weibull function and the fractional kinetics approach leading to release profiles described by a Mittag-Leffler function. We used Monte Carlo simulations to generate artificial release data from euclidean and fractal substrates. We have also used real release data from the literature and found that both models are capable in describing release data up to roughly 85% of the release. For larger times both models systematically overestimate the number of particles remaining in the release device.

   BIOAVAILABILITY; IBUPROFEN POWDERS; TENSILE-STRENGTH; MELT EXTRUSION
AB It has been shown that dry coating cohesive active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with nano-silica can improve packing and flow of their blends, facilitating high speed direct compression tableting. This paper examines the broader scope and generality of previous work by examining three fine APIs; micronized Acetaminophen (mAPAP), coarse Acetaminophen (cAPAP) and micronized Ibuprofen (mIBU), and considers dry coating with both hydrophobic or hydrophilic nano-silica to examine the effect not only on packing density and flow of their blends, but also dissolution and tensile strength of their tablets. The impact of the excipient size on blend and tablet properties are also investigated, indicating blend flow is most improved when matching API particle size with excipient particle size. In all cases where the API is dry coated, the blend packing and flow improve, so as to suggest such high drug loaded blends could enable direct compression. Using dry coated API along with finer excipients in blends lead to improved hardness of the corresponding tablets. Interestingly, dissolution profiles show dry coated API tablets generally have faster dissolution rates, regardless of silica hydrophilicity, suggesting API powder deagglomeration via nano-silica coating plays a crucial role. The most significant conclusion is that, although there are differences in properties of blends that depend on the API, hydrophobic or hydrophilic nanosilica coating, as well as large or fine excipients, in all cases, dry coating of APIs significantly improves the possibility of using the specific blend at high drug loading in direct compression tableting.

AB Restoration of the Choi homeostasis in the Central Nervous System (CNS) could be beneficial for the treatment of Huntington's Disease (HD), a progressive, fatal, adult-onset, neurodegenerative disorder. Unfortunately, Chol is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), thus a novel strategy for a targeted delivery of Chol into the brain is highly desired.
   This article aims to investigate the production of hybrid nanoparticles composed by Chol and PLGA (MIX-NPs) modified with g7 ligand for BBB crossing.
   We described the impact of ratio between components (Chol and PLGA) and formulation process (nanoprecipitation or single emulsion process) on physico-chemical and structural characteristics, we tested MIX-NPs in vitro using primary hippocampal cell cultures evaluating possible toxicity, uptake, and the ability to influence excitatory synaptic receptors. Our results elucidated that both formulation processes produce MIX-NPs with a Chol content higher that 40%, meaning that Chol is a structural particle component and active compound at the same time. The formulation strategy impacted the architecture and reorganization of components leading to some differences in Chol availability between the two types of g7 MIX-NPs. Our results identified that both kinds of MIX-NPs are efficiently taken up by neurons, able to escape lysosomes and release Chol into the cells resulting in an efficient modification in expression of synaptic receptors that could be beneficial in HD.

AB In this study, we demonstrated that cationic liposomes with incorporated stearylamine (SA) inhibit viral infectivity without preloaded active pharmaceutical ingredients. Specifically, we correlated physiochemical properties of liposomes, such as zeta potentials and particle sizes, with virus infectivity using the BacMam (TM) reagent, which is based on recombinant baculovirus (BV). Compared with neutral or negatively-charged liposomes, SA liposomes suppressed BV infectivity in several mammalian cell lines, including A549 cells. SA liposomes inhibited BV infection over 80% by optimizing the liposomal concentration and exposure time with cells. Moreover, these antiviral SA liposomes were not cytotoxic, and reducing the embedded cholesterol contents intensified the antiviral effects and simultaneously increased the binding of SA liposomes to the cell membranes. These data indicate that binding of SA liposomes to cell membranes may block virus entry. Finally, we also demonstrated the antiviral effects of SA liposomes on herpes simplex virus type 1 in A549 cells, and showed comparable efficacy to that of the antiviral drug acyclovir.

AB This study aimed to develop dry powder particles with surfaces enriched in hydrophobic material by manipulation of spray-drying conditions and to investigate the effect of hydrophobic surface enrichment on aerosolization of hygroscopic drug.
   The composite dry powder formulations of kanamycin (hygroscopic drug) and rifampicin (hydrophobic drug) were produced by systematically (2(3) full factorial design) varying the drug ratio, co-solvent composition and inlet temperature using Buchi B-290 Mini Spray-Dryer. All the composite powder particles were inhalable in size (3.1-3.9 mu m), wrinkled, flake-shaped and amorphous. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry showed that hydrophobic surface enrichment was significantly affected by cosolvent composition. Complete hydrophobic surface enrichment was achieved in one formulation (F7). The aerosolization efficiency by next generation impactor (NGI) showed that the composite formulations had higher fine particle fraction (FPF: > 48.0%) than kanamycin-only formulation (FPF: 27.6%). Increase in hydrophobic surface enrichment (from 80.8 to 100%) decreased the powder density and increased FPF (from 48.0 to 77.2%).
   This is the first systematic study reporting the manipulation of spray-drying conditions for hydrophobic surface enrichment in composite dry powder particles and its effect on aerosolization. The high aerosolization efficiency of the combination formulations may be useful to deliver high doses of these drugs to treat lung infections.

AB Lately, a great deal of attention is being paid to capsule coating, since the coat protects active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from damage, as is in the case of tablet and pellet. However, moisture and heat sensitivity of gelatin shells make it challenging to coat capsules using the conventional aqueous coating techniques. In an effort to overcome this challenge, the present study aims to coat capsules using two different coating techniques: electrostatic dry powder coating (EDPC) and dip coating (DC). Both capsule coatings and free films were prepared by these two coating techniques, and the effects of coating formulations and processing conditions on the film quality were investigated. The corresponding drug in vitro release and mechanisms were characterized and compared. The results of dissolution tests demonstrated that the drug release behavior of both EDPC and DC coated capsules could be optimized to a sustained release of 24 h, following the Fick's diffusion law. The results of this study suggest that EDPC method is better than DC method for coating capsules, with respect to the higher production efficiency and better stability, indicating that this dry coating technology has promised in gelatin capsule coating applications.

AB The aim of the present work was to investigate the ability of nonionic surfactants to increase the oral absorption of the P-glycoprotein substrate etoposide in vitro and in vivo. Intestinal absorption was investigated by studying bidirectional permeability of etoposide across filter-grown Caco-2 and MDCKII MDR1 cell monolayers. The oral absorption of etoposide was investigated in wild type (WT) and mdr1a deficient (KO) Sprague-Dawley rats. In cell cultures, polysorbate 20 (PS20) decreased P-glycoprotein mediated efflux of etoposide. When PS20 and etoposide were co-administered to WT rats, the oral absorption of etoposide increased significantly in the presence of 5 and 25% (v/v) PS20. However, in KO rats, the exposure of etoposide after oral co-administration with 5% PS20 was similar to control. Unexpectedly, co-administration of etoposide with 25% PS20 significantly reduced the absorption fraction of etoposide in mdr1a KO rats. In vitro dialysis studies performed on PS20containing etoposide solutions suggested that the reduced bioavailability may be due to etoposide retention in PS20 micelles and/or through increased viscosity. In conclusion, PS20 increases oral bioavailability of etoposide through inhibition of P-glycoprotein. However, the use of the excipient may be challenged by etoposide retention at higher concentrations.

AB Robust in vitro drug release behavior is an important feature of extended release (ER) hydrophilic matrix formulations for accurate prediction of in vivo drug release. In this study, ER hydrophilic matrix tablets of metoprolol tartrate were formulated using a high viscosity grade of hypromellose as a rate-limiting polymer. Expectedly, this formulation showed an undesirable initial burst release followed by controlled drug release. Application of a barrier membrane (BM) coating of ethylcellulose with a pore former (hypromellose) resulted in the elimination of the burst effect. The aim of this study was to investigate the robustness of in vitro metoprolol release from BM-coated hydrophilic matrix tablets by simulating the physicochemical properties of gastrointestinal fluids and mechanical stress in the fasted- and fed state human gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Uncoated and BM-coated matrices were subjected to various dissolution studies simulating the varying pH conditions and additional physicochemical parameters, and the mechanical stress that can be caused by GI motility during both fasted and fed state GI passage. The BM-coated formulation showed robust drug release without an initial burst in all test scenarios. BM-coated matrix formulations thus represent a very promising approach for obtaining a highly controlled and robust drug release from oral ER formulations.

AB High-speed laser imaging (HSLI) is the preferred technique to characterize the geometry of the plume in pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs). However, current methods do not allow for simulation of inhalation airflow and do not use drug mass quantification to determine plume angles. To address these limitations, a Plume Induction Port Evaluator (PIPE) was designed to characterize the plume geometry based on mass deposition patterns. The method is easily adaptable to current pMDI characterization methodologies, uses similar calculations methods, and can be used under airflow. The effect of airflow and formulation on the plume geometry were evaluated using PIPE and HSLI. Deposition patterns in PIPE were highly reproducible and log-normal distributed. Mass Median Plume Angle (MMPA) was a new characterization parameter to describe the effective angle of the droplets deposited in the induction port. Plume angles determined by mass showed a significant decrease in size as ethanol increases which correlates to the decrease on vapor pressure in the formulation. Additionally, airflow significantly decreased the angle of the plumes when cascade impactor was operated under flow. PIPE is an alternative to laser-based characterization methods to evaluate the plume angle of pMDIs based on reliable drug quantification while simulating patient inhalation.

AB DAZAP1 is an evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding protein expressed in many tissues in mice and humans. DAZAP1-knockout mice carrying a partial loss-of-function (hypomorphic) allele exhibited severe deficiencies in spermatogenesis and cell growth, indicating that DAZAP1 plays a pivotal role in the development of germ and somatic cells. We have identified cox6c mRNA, which encodes a subunit of complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, as a target transcript regulated by DAZAP1. We found that DAZAP1 bound to cox6c mRNA derived from either the genomic DNA or a genome-type expression vector in cells, but not to cox6c mRNA derived from an intronless expression vector. Interestingly, the presence of the last intron was sufficient for DAZAP1 binding to the mRNA, suggesting specific intron dependent DAZAP1 loading onto cox6c mRNA. Overexpression of DAZAP1 resulted in the accumulation of cox6c pre-mRNA for all introns, implying that DAZAP1 reduces pre-mRNA splicing efficiency. In addition, the reduction of mature cox6c mRNA levels led to decreases in the COX6C protein levels. Both DAZAP1 knockdown and COX6C overexpression retarded cell growth. The lines of evidence presented here reveal that DAZAP1 is a negative regulator of pre-mRNA splicing and may control energy production in mitochondria by regulating COX6C expression. The DAZAP1 functions described in this study may also account for the phenotypes observed in the DAZAP1 hypomorphic mice.

AB Bone-Marrow Stromal Cells (BMSCs)-derived vascular endothelial cells (VECs) is regarded as an important therapeutic strategy for spinal cord injury, disc degeneration, cerebral ischemic disease and diabetes. The change in DNA methylation level is essential for stem cell differentiation. However, the DNA methylation related mechanisms underlying the endothelial differentiation of BMSCs are not well understood. In this study, DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) significantly elevated the endothelial markers expression (CD31/PECAM1, CD105/ENG, eNOS and VE-cadherin), as well as promoted the capacity of angiogenesis on Matrigel. The result of Alexa 488-Ac-LDL uptake assay indicated that the differentiation ratio of BMSCs into VECs was 68.7% in 5-azaz-dC induced differentiation. And then we screened differentiation inducers with altered expression patterns and DNA methylation levels in four important families (VEGF, ANG, FGF and ETS). By integrating these data, five endothelial differentiation inducers (VEGFA, ANGPT2, FGF2, FGF9 and ETS1) which were directly upregulated by 5-aza-dC and five indirect factors (FGF1, FGF3, ETS2, ETV1 and ETV4) were identified. These data suggested that 5-aza-dC is an excellent chemical molecule for BMSCs differentiation into functional VECs and also provided essential clues for DNA methylation related signaling during 5-aza-dC induced endothelial differentiation of BMSCs.

AB Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders in reproductive-aged women. However, the exact pathophysiology of PCOS remains largely unclear. We performed deep sequencing to investigate the mRNA and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) expression profiles in the ovarian tissues of letrozole-induced PCOS rat model and control rats. A total of 2147 mRNAs and 158 lncRNAs were differentially expressed between the PCOS models and control. Gene ontology analysis indicated that differentially expressed mRNAs were associated with biological adhesion, reproduction, and metabolic process. Pathway analysis results indicated that these aberrantly expressed mRNAs were related to several specific signaling pathways, including insulin resistance, steroid hormone biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, cell adhesion molecules, autoimmune thyroid disease, and AMPK signaling pathway. The relative expression levels of mRNAs and lncRNAs were validated through qRT-PCR. LncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was constructed to explore ceRNAs involved in the PCOS model and were also verified by qRTPCR experiment. These findings may provide insight into the pathogenesis of PCOS and clues to find key diagnostic and therapeutic roles of lncRNA in PCOS.

AB microRNAs (miRNAs) are reported to play crucial roles in tumorigenesis. Dysregulation of miR-520f has been implicated to be involved in several cancer progressions. However, the biological functions of miR520f in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. Thus, the molecular mechanism underlying miR-520f on HCC development was investigated in this study. Here, we found that miR-520f was remarkably down-regulated in human HCC samples and cell lines compared to paired normal tissues and cell lines as detected by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, the deregulated miR-520f was strongly associated with larger tumor size, advanced TNM stage, and metastasis in HCC patients. Functional investigations revealed that overexpression of miR-520f significantly suppressed cell proliferation, invasion and migration, caused cell cycle arrested at G0/G1 phase, and promoted cell apoptosis in HCC cells according to MTT, colony formation, transwell, and flow cytometry assays, respectively, whereas, downregulation of miR-520f exhibited inverse effects. Transmembrane-4 L-Six family member-1 (TM4SF1) was identified as a direct target of miR-520f, and an inverse relationship was found between miR-520f and TM4SF1 mRNA levels in HCC specimens. Rescue experiments suggested that restoration of TM4SF1 partially abolished miR-520f-meidated cell proliferation and invasion inhibition in HCC cells through regulating P13K/AKT and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. In conclusion, these data indicated that miR-520f acted as tumor suppressor in HCC proliferation and invasion by targeting TM4SF1, which might provide potential therapeutic evidence for HCC patients.

AB In phylogenomic profiling, the genomic context based methods are based on the observation that two or more proteins having the same pattern of presence or absence in many diverse genomes most likely have a functional link.

In this tool, the secondary structure for CATH database protein sequences, predicted by the SOPM (Self Optimized Prediction Method) server is passed as input to fulfill objectives such as, (i) Predict the Amino Acid Pattern using the proposed Hybrid KMP and BM algorithm, (ii) Predict the physiochemical properties such as Hydrophobic Non-Polar ALKYL Amino Acid groups, Hydrophobic Non-Polar AROMATIC Amino Acid groups, Hydrophilic Polar Neutral Amino Acid groups, Hydrophilic Polar Acidic Amino Acid groups and Hydrophilic Polar Basic Amino Acid groups of protein sequence, (iii) Predict the secondary structure of protein where the structure of protein sequence is unknown, and (iv) Similarity analysis of protein sequence (structure unknown) with the CATH database. From the results, it is inferred that this tool effectively predicts the similarity between the sequences and also identifies the protein patterns for four secondary structural classes, namely Alpha Helix (h), Beta Sheet (e), Turn (t) and Coil (c). Based on the experimental results, it is inferred that this tool identifies the physiochemical properties of the protein sequence in an effective manner. The source code and its documentation for the PATSIM tool is freely available in the GitHub public repository (https://github.com/manimkn89/Protein-Sequence-Analysis).

AB Objective: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted agent in the world. HPV6b is a low-risk type of HPVs that causes benign verrucous hyperplastic lesions of the skin and anal genital mucosa. Previous research has indicated that HPV genotype 6 is sometimes associated with high-grade lesions and anal cancer. The pathogenesis of low-risk HPV infection and its relationship to high-risk HPV is not clear at present. The E7 protein, which is encoded by HPV early-expressing genes, plays an important role in HPV infection. The aim of this study is to investigate the human gene expression signature of the HPV6b E7-transfected HaCaT stable cell line. The identification of differentially expressed genes might provide a more comprehensive understanding of HPV6b infection and will allow us to explore the specific role of E7 protein.
   Methods: We established a stable cell line transfected with the HPV6b E7 gene and analyzed the line's genome-wide expression profile by microarray. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to verify the differentially expressed genes. GO enrichment analysis was applied for gene annotation according to functions. KEGG analysis, a system for analyzing gene function and genome information, was used to help us integrate differentially expressed genes into pathways.
   Results: A total of 3519 genes were identified to be significantly differentially expressed between the HPV 6bE7-HaCaT stable cell line and a control cell line, among which 1884 genes were up-regulated and 1635 genes were down-regulated with a fold-change > 2.0 between the two groups. The expression profiles of the top 20 up regulated and the top 20 down-regulated genes in the HPV 6bE7-HaCaT stable cell line as analyzed by qRT-PCR were consistent with the microarray data. The most significantly enhanced genes HPV 6bE7-HaCaT cells were SIMC1, S100A8 and S100A9, whereas PXDN expression was markedly down-regulated. GO analysis showed that HPV 6bE7 primarily affected biological processes and that the most significant difference was in heart induction (GO:0003129). Many differentially expressed genes were linked to histone H4-K20 demethylation (GO:0035574). KEGG analysis showed that the most significant changes in gene expression were related to primary bile acid biosynthesis, and the most diverse biological processes were related to systemic lupus erythematosus pathogenesis.
   Conclusions: The global gene expression profile of the HPV 6bE7-HaCaT stable cell line was analyzed, revealing the genes regulated by E7 protein and providing insight into the pathogenesis of HPV6b infection.

AB Radish is an economically important vegetable crop belonging to the family Brassicaceae. The high anthocyanin content of the 'Xinlimer radish roots has been associated with diverse health benefits. However, there is a lack of transcript-level information regarding anthocyanin biosynthesis. In the present study, the 'Xinlimei' radish root transcriptome was analyzed by RNA sequencing at five developmental stages. A total of 222,384,034 clean reads were obtained and 32,253 unigenes were annotated. Expression profiles revealed 10,890 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among the five analyzed libraries. The DEGs were predominantly involved in KEGG pathways related to the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, flavone, and flavonol. The transcriptome data revealed 44 structural and 182 transcription factor genes (TFs) associated with the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. Ten structural genes (i.e., 4CL3, CHSB2, CHS1, CHS3, F3H1, F3'H, DFR, DFR1, ANS, and UFGT) and two MYB genes, which were highly and differentially expressed during root development, may be critical for anthocyanin biosynthesis. Additionally, the co-expression of TFs and structural genes was analyzed. Three structural genes (i.e., DFR, ANS, and UFGT) were validated by molecular cloning. The qRT-PCR results indicated that the expression profiles of DEGs were generally consistent with the high-throughput sequencing results. These findings helped identify candidate genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis and may be useful for clarifying the molecular mechanism underlying the accumulation of anthocyanins in radish roots.

AB Ginger is a popular spice used in food and beverages. In this study, we sought to characterize and differentiate ginger samples of Ghana and China origin using label-free proteomic and untargeted metabolomic analyses. As result, a total of 180 proteins significantly changed between the ginger samples from both studied countries. Among them, 17 proteins were specifically identified in the Chinese ginger, while 23 proteins were only identified in the Ghanaian ginger. Function and bioinformatics analyses indicated that changes in carbon metabolism, secondary metabolites biosyntheses, citrate acid cycle, and amino acids biosyntheses-related pathways contributed to the differences. These results were confirmed through the identification of 14 significantly changed metabolites including diarylheptanoids and gingerols. Importantly, change tendencies of these metabolites corresponded to changes in abundance of the protein enzymes involved in their syntheses. These results suggest that changes in metabolism-related protein enzymes are responsible for the intraspecies difference of the ginger samples.

AB The understanding of the structure morphology of oil-rich emulsion from enzyme-assisted extraction processing (EAEP) was a critical step to break the oil-rich emulsion structure in order to recover oil. Albeit EAEP method has been applied as an alternative way to conventional solvent extraction method, the structure morphology of oil-rich emulsion was still unclear. The current study aimed to investigate the structure morphology of oil-rich emulsion from EAEP using 3D confocal Raman imaging technique. With increasing the enzymatic hydrolysis duration from 1 to 3 h, the stability of oil-rich emulsion was decreased as visualized in the 3D confocal Raman images that the protein and oil were mixed together. The subsequent Raman spectrum analysis further revealed that the decreased stability of oil-rich emulsion was due to the protein aggregations via SS bonds or protein-lipid interactions. The conformational transfer in protein indicated the formation of a compact structure.

AB The properties and stability of spray-dried beetroot extract using maltodextrin (MD), inulin (IN), and whey protein isolate (WPI) as carrier agents were evaluated. The values of moisture, betalains content, and retention were 3.33-4.24%, 348.79-385.47 mg/100 g (dry-basis), and 88.45-95.69%, respectively. Higher values of antioxidant activity were observed for the treatments using WPI. The treatment with inulin alone presented higher hygroscopicity in the moisture adsorption isotherms at 25 degrees C and lower thermal stability when evaluating the thermogravimetric curves. When stored at 60 degrees C, the use of WPI alone conferred lower stability to the beetroot extract powder. In general, the simultaneous use of IN and WPI as carrier agents resulted in good stability of the beetroot extract powder, representing an opportunity for innovation in food products.

AB To develop a new healthy functional tofu product, the pH, total cell number, SDS-PAGE patterns, contents of reducing sugar, peptide, isoflavones, antioxidant activity and digestibility of freeze-thawed tofu, fermented with Bacillus subtilis for various time periods, were investigated. In SDS-PAGE patterns, the band intensities of 7S and 11S globulins were slightly decreased and new protein bands of lower molecular weight appeared by fermentation for 12 h. After 18 h, the bands of 7S globulin and the acidic subunit of 11S globulin had almost entirely disappeared and the basic subunit band of 11S globulin was fainter. An 18 h of fermentation was thought to be the most desirable, because the contents of reducing sugar, total peptide, and isoflavone aglycones (daidzein and genistein), as well as antioxidant activities and digestibility of freeze-thawed tofu were more increased by the fermentation for 18 h.

The optimized sample preparation was applied to a set of samples representing most of the products in the marketplace. Results on Standard Reference Material 1849a were well in agreement with certified values. The main contributor to total folate was folic acid, 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate was the only minor contributor in milk-based products. Soy-based formulas contained polyglutamates of 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate. The relative contribution of polyglutamates to the total folate content remained low in the types of product included in this study. The results suggest that a simple di-enzyme treatment could be enough for these products, nevertheless, this should be carefully evaluated prior to making a decision on the use of tri-or di-enzyme treatment.

AB This investigation aims to evaluate the effects of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) applied prior to germination on functionality and quality of wholegrain-germinated brown rice (GBR). Wholegrain brown rice (WBR) were firstly stressed by HHP treatments (50-350 MPa/20 min), and then incubated at 37 degrees C to obtain GBR grains after a 2-day soaking period. Gama-aminobutyric acid contents significantly depended on the pressure applied, showing 25% increment in 50 MPa-stressed grains compared to the control. HHP shock led to significantly improved in vitro starch digestibility, which was related to the transformation of crystalline starch granules into amorphous form as consistently revealed by scanning electron microscope imaging and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. HHP-pretreated samples achieved markedly enhanced storability by influencing kinetic curves of lipid hydrolysis and oxidation. These results suggested that metabolic response to HHP during germination could significantly improve functional and quality characteristics of WBR products.

AB In this work, it has been developed an efficient method for extraction of anthocyanin from Lycium ruthenicum Murr. and the antioxidative activities research. Subcritical water extraction was investigated as a green technology for the extraction of anthocyanin from L. ruthenicum. Several key parameters affecting extraction efficiency were investigated and optimized by response surface methodology (RSM) combined with Box-Behnken design (BBD). The optimum extraction conditions and the desirability of model were the time of extraction=55 min and the flow rate was 3 mL/min at 170 degrees C. At this operating condition, the content of anthocyanin was high to 26.33%. Subcritical water extraction was more efficient than using hot water or methyl alcohol for the extraction of anthocyanin. The composition of anthocyanins from L. ruthenicum has been investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) and Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Triple-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer (UPLC-Triple-TOF/MS). Seven anthocyanins have been detected, all of which were identified and quantified. Furthermore, the anthocyanins extracted by SWE showed significantly better antioxidant activity than the anthocyanins extracted by hot water or methyl alcohol according to DPPH and ABTS assay. SWE with significantly higher anthocyanin and antioxidant activity were achieved compared to conventional methods.

AB Patulin (PAT) is a type of mycotoxin which can compromise both food quality and human health. Due to its harmful effects, strict monitoring of PAT contents in food systems is necessary. A novel kind of bioassay was proposed for determining PAT based on the fluorescent resonant energy transfer (FRET) strategy. The exonuclease-catalyzed target recycling strategy was employed to improve the sensitivity of the FRET system. The results showed that the linear range extends from 0.01 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL. Furthermore, the average recoveries ranged from 93.33% to 105.21%, confirming the reliability of this method. The total analysis time for our assay developed is about 50 min. Compared to traditional analytical methods, the developed assay is more stable and has a significantly lower detection of limit (0.003 ng/mL). We believe the approach developed in this study would be useful for high-throughput screening of PAT in food industry and government laboratory.

AB A biodegradable colorimetric film was fabricated on the lid of portable tube for in-tube formaldehyde detection. Based on the entrapment of colorimetric reagents within a thin film of tapioca starch, the yellow reaction product was observed with formaldehyde. Intensity of the blue channel from the digital image of yellow product showed a linear relationship in the range of 0-25 mg L-1 with low detection limit of 0.7 +/- 0.1 mg L-1. Interday precision of 0.61-3.10% RSD were obtained with less than 4.2% relative error from control samples. The developed method was applied for various food samples in Phuket and formaldehyde concentration range was non-detectable to 1.413 mg kg(-1). The quantified concentrations of formaldehyde in fish and squid samples provided relative errors of -7.7% and +10.8% compared to spectrophotometry. This low cost sensor (similar to 0.04 USD/ test) with digital image colorimetry was thus an effective alternative for formaldehyde detection in food sample.

AB An integrated microfluidic platform comprising a microfluidic paper-based analytical device (mu PAD) and a portable detection system is proposed for the concentration detection of benzoic acid via Janovsky reaction theory. In the proposed approach, the reaction zone of the mu PAD is implanted with 5 N sodium hydroxide and dried at 30 degrees C for 20 min. The benzoic acid sample is derived to 3,5-Dinitrobenzoic acid using KNO3 and H2SO4 at 40 degrees C for 40 min and is then dripped on the reaction zone of the mu PAD. Finally, the mu PAD is transferred to the portable detection system and heated at a temperature of 45 degrees C for 20 min on a hot plate to prompt a Janovsky reaction. The resulting color change of the detection zone is observed using a CMOS camera. The reaction color image is delivered to a smartphone via a connector and the benzoic acid concentration is determined using selfwritten RGB analysis software. The experimental results obtained using control samples with known benzoic acid concentrations in the range of 500-4000 ppm show that the R(ed)+ B(lue) intensity (Y) and benzoic acid concentration (X) are related as Y= -0.0264 X+ 408.79. Moreover, the correlation coefficient is equal to R-2= 0.9953. The proposed detection platform is used to measure the benzoic acid concentrations of twenty-one commercial food samples. It is shown that the concentration measurements deviate by no more than 6.6% from those obtained using a standard HPLC macroscale method. Overall, the results presented in this study show that the proposed integrated microfluidic paper-based chip platform provides a compact and reliable tool for benzoic acid concentration measurement purposes.

AB The Tieguanyin oolong tea is popular in China. However, the quality development and chemical change during processing were still unclear. This study aimed to investigate the chemical compositions and quality of Tieguanyin oolong teas processed from different leaves of fresh shoots. The results showed the fermentation degree of oolong teas decreased from the first leaves to the fourth-fifth leaves, and was associated with the changes in infusion color (b*) and chroma, as well as the contents of total theaflavins, (E)-nerolidol and indole. After shaking and setting, the differences in the water contents and the activities of polyphenoloxidase, peroxidase, and ss-glucosidase of the tea leaves, significantly influenced the oxidation of catechins. The hydrolysis of volatile compounds might influence the fermentation degrees of the oolong teas processed from different leaves of fresh shoots. The results generated from the present study can be used in guiding the production of oolong teas.

AB Our recent research indicated that honey active macromolecules form colloidal particles that scatter the light and produce elaborate UV spectral profile dominated by double absorption peaks at 240-250 nm. The absorption at 240-250 nm signified the stable honey conformation that supported antibacterial activity and hydrogen peroxide production. Our aim was to identify the bioactive constituent relevant to this absorption. The methodology included activity-guided fractionation of honey through size-exclusion chromatography, solid-phase extraction and UPLC-UV-MS. UV spectral analysis of UPLC peaks revealed compounds with UV lambda (max) typical of naphtoquinones. The MS chromatograms showed mass ions differing by [M-68(n)] indicating a polyisoprene structure and the fragmentation patterns typical for menaquinones. The exact mass measurements of menaquinones using a quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry confirmed their identification as a series of MK-3 to MK-7 aptimers. Detection of menaquinones, previously unknown constituents of honey, suggests that they might play role in honey redox and antibacterial activities.

AB Hand, foot and mouth diseases (HFMD) are mainly caused by Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) infections. Clinical trials in Asia conducted with formalin-inactivated EV-A71 vaccine candidates produced from serum-free Vero cell culture using either roller bottle or cell factory technology, are found to be safe and highly efficacious. To increase vaccine yields and reduce the production costs, the bioprocess improvement for EV-A71 vaccine manufacturing is currently being investigated. The parameters that could affect and enhance the production yields of EV-A71 virus growth in the microcarrier bioreactor were investigated. The medium replacement culture strategy included a multi-harvested semi-batch process and perfusion technology and was found to increase the production yields more than 7-14 folds. Based on the western blot and cryo-EM analyses of the EV-A71 virus particles produced from either the multi-harvested semi-batch (MHSBC) or perfusion cultures were found to be similar to those virus particles obtained from the single batch culture. Mouse immunogenicity studies indicate that the EV-A71 vaccine candidates produced from the perfusion culture have similar potency to those obtained from single batch bioprocess. The physical structures of the EV-A71 particles revealed by the cryo-EM analysis were found to be spherical capsid particles. These results provide feasible technical bioprocesses for increasing virus yields and the scale up of EV-A71 vaccine manufacturing using the bioreactor cell culture methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses cause a severe and lethal infection in domestic birds. The increasing number of HPAI outbreaks has demonstrated the lack of capabilities to control the rapid spread of avian influenza. Poultry vaccination has been shown to not only reduce the virus spread in animals but also reduce the virus transmission to humans, preventing potential pandemic development. However, existing vaccine technologies cannot respond to a new virus outbreak rapidly and at a cost and scale that is commercially viable for poultry vaccination. Here, we developed modular capsomere, subunits of virus-like particle, as a low-cost poultry influenza vaccine. Modified murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) VP1 capsomere was used to present structural-based influenza Hemagglutinin (HA1) antigen. Six constructs of modular capsomeres presenting three truncated versions of HA] and two constructs of modular capsomeres presenting non-modified HA1 have been generated. These modular capsomeres were successfully produced in stable forms using Escherichia coli, without the need for protein refolding. Based on ELISA, this adjuvanted modular capsomere (CaptHA1-3C) induced strong antibody response (almost 10(5) endpoint titre) when administered into chickens, similar to titres obtained in the group administered with insect cell-based HA1 proteins. Chickens that received adjuvanted CaptHA1-3C followed by challenge with HPAI virus were fully protected. The results presented here indicate that this platform for bacterially-produced modular capsomere could potentially translate into a rapid-response and low-cost vaccine manufacturing technology suitable for poultry vaccination.

AB VP2/VP6 virus like particles (VLPs) are very effective in inducing protection against the rotavirus infection in animal models. Individually, VP6 can also induce protection. However, there is no information about the immunogenicity of VP2. The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of DNA vaccines codifying for VP2 or VP6, alone or combined, to induce protection against the rotavirus infection. Murine rotavirus VP2 and VP6 genes were cloned into the pcDNA3 vector. Adult BALB/c mice were inoculated three times by intramuscular (i.m.) injections with 100 or 200 mu g of pcDNA3-VP2 or pcDNA3-VP6 alone or co-administered with 100 mu g of pcDNA3-VP2/100 mu g of pcDNA3-VP6. Two weeks after the last inoculation, mice were challenged with the wild type murine rotavirus strain epizootic diarrhea of infant mice (EDIMwt). We found that both plasmids, pcDNA3-VP2 and pcDNA3-VP6, were able to induce rotavirus-specific serum antibodies, but not intestinal rotavirus-specific IgA; only 200 mu g of pcDNA3-VP6 induced 35% protection against the infection. A similar level of protection was found when mice were co-administered with 100 mu g of pcDNA3-VP2/100 mu g of pcDNA3-VP6 (1:1 ratio). However, the best protection (up to 58%) occurred when mice were inoculated with 10 mu g of pcDNA3-VP2/100 mu g of pcDNA3-VP6 (1:10 ratio). These results indicate that the DNA plasmid expressing VP6 is a better vaccine candidate that the one expressing VP2. However, when co-expressed, VP2 potentiates the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of VP6. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Despite the routine development and distribution of seasonal influenza vaccines, influenza remains an important pathogen contributing to significant human morbidity as well as mortality each year. The seasonal variability of influenza creates a significant issue for vaccine development of seasonal strains that can afford protection from infection or disease based on serotype matching. It is appreciated that the globular head of the HA antigen contained in the vaccines generates antibodies that result in HAI activity that are a major correlates of the protection against a particular strain. Due to seasonal genetic changes in the HA protein, however, new vaccine strains are needed to be developed continually to match the new HA antigen of that seasons virus. A distinct advantage in seasonal vaccine development would be if a small group of antigens could be developed that could span many seasons without needed to be replaced due to this genetic drift. Here we report on a synthetic microconsensus approach that relies on a small collection of 4 synthetic H1HA DNA antigens which together induce broad protective HAI immunity spanning decades of H1 influenza viruses in mice, guinea pigs and non-human primates. The protective HAI titers induced by microconsensus immunogens are fully functional in vivo as immunized ferrets were completely protected from A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009 virus infection and morbidity associated with lethal challenge. These results are encouraging that a limited easy-to-formulate collection of invariant antigens can be developed which can span seasonal vaccine changes allowing for continued immune protection.

AB Infections with filoviruses in humans are highly virulent, causing hemorrhagic fevers which result in up to 90% mortality. In addition to natural infections, the ability to use these viruses as bioterrorist weapons is of significant concern. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics available to combat these infections. The pathogenesis of disease involves the dysregulation of the host's immune system, which results in impairment of the innate and adaptive immune responses, with subsequent development of lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, and death. Questions remain with regard to the few survivors of infection, who manage to mount an effective adaptive immune response. These questions concern the humoral and cellular components of this response, and whether such a response can be elicited by an appropriate prophylactic vaccine. The data reported herein describe the production and evaluation of a recombinant subunit Ebola virus vaccine candidate consisting of insect cell expressed Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) surface glycoprotein (GP) and the matrix proteins VP24 and VP40. The recombinant subunit proteins are shown to be highly immunogenic in mice, yielding both humoral and cellular responses, as well as highly efficacious, providing up to 100% protection against a lethal challenge with live virus. These results demonstrate proof of concept for such a recombinant non-replicating vaccine candidate in the mouse model of EBOV which helps to elucidate immune correlates of protection and warrants further development.

AB The influenza vaccine manufacturing industry is looking for production cell lines that are easily scalable, highly permissive to multiple viruses, and more effective in term of viral productivity. One critical characteristic of such cell lines is their ability to grow in suspension, in serum free conditions and at high cell densities. Influenza virus causing severe epidemics both in human and animals is an important threat to world healthcare. The repetitive apparition of influenza pandemic outbreaks in the last 20 years explains that manufacturing sector is still looking for more effective production processes to replace/supplement embryonated egg-based process. Cell-based production strategy, with a focus on avian cell lines, is one of the promising solutions. Three avian cell lines, namely duck EB66 cells (Valneva), duck AGE.CR (R) cells (Probiogen) and quail QOR/2E11 cells (Baxter), are now competing with traditional mammalian cell platforms (Vero and MDCK cells) used for influenza vaccine productions and are currently at advance stage of commercial development for the manufacture of influenza vaccines. The DuckCet (R)-T17 cell line presented in this work is a novel avian cell line developed by Transgene. This cell line was generated from primary embryo duck cells with the constitutive expression of the duck telomerase reverse transcriptase (dTERT).
   The DuckCet (R)-T17 cells were able to grow in batch suspension cultures and serum-free conditions up to 6.5 x 10(6) cell/ml and were easily scaled from 10 ml up to 31 bioreactor. In the present study, DuckCet (R)-T17 cell line was tested for its abilities to produce various human, avian and porcine influenza strains. Most of the viral strains were produced at significant infectious titers (>5.8 log TCID50/ml) with optimization of the infection conditions. Human strains H1N1 and H3N2, as well as all the avian strains tested (H5N2, H7N1, H3N8, H11N9, H12N5) were the most efficiently produced with highest titre reached of 9.05 log TCID50/ml for A/Panama/2007/99 influenza H3N2. Porcine strains were also greatly rescued with titres from 4 to 7 log TCID50/ml depending of the subtypes. Interestingly, viral kinetics showed maximal titers reached at 24 h post-infection for most of the strains, allowing early harvest time (Time Of Harvest: TOH). The B strains present specific production kinetics with a delay of 24 h before reaching the maximal viral particle release. Process optimization on H1N1 2009 human pandemic strain allowed identifying best operating conditions for production (MOI, trypsin concentration, cell density at infection) allowing improving the production level by 2 log. Our results suggest that the DuckCet (R)-T17 cell line is a very promising platform for industrial production of influenza viruses and particularly for avian viral strains. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Safer and broadly protective vaccines are needed to cope with the continuous evolution of circulating influenza virus strains and promising approaches based on the expression of multiple hemagglutinins (HA) in a virus-like particle (VLP) have been proposed. However, expression of multiple genes in the same vector can lead to its instability due to tandem repetition of similar sequences. By combining stable with transient expression systems we can rationally distribute the number of genes to be expressed per platform and thus mitigate this risk. In this work, we developed a modular system comprising stable and baculovirus-mediated expression in insect cells for production of multi-HA influenza enveloped VLPs. First, a stable insect High Five cell population expressing two different HA proteins from subtype H3 was established. Infection of this cell population with a baculovirus vector encoding three other HA proteins from H3 subtype proved to be as competitive as traditional co-infection approaches in producing a pentavalent H3 VLP. Aiming at increasing HA expression, the stable insect cell population was infected at increasingly higher cell concentrations (CCI). However, cultures infected at CCI of 3 x 10(6) cells/mL showed lower HA titers per cell in comparison to standard CCI of 2 x 10(6) cells/mL, a phenomenon named "cell density effect". To lessen the negative impact of this phenomenon, a tailor-made refeed strategy was designed based on the exhaustion of key nutrients during cell growth. Noteworthy, cultures supplemented and infected at a CCI of 4 x 10(6) cells/mL showed comparable HA titers per cell to those of CCI of 2 x 10(6) cells/mL, thus leading to an increase of up to 4-fold in HA titers per mL. Scalability of the modular strategy herein proposed was successfully demonstrated in 2 L stirred tank bioreactors with comparable HA protein levels observed between bioreactor and shake flasks cultures. Overall, this work demonstrates the suitability of combining stable with baculovirus-mediated expression in insect cells as an efficient platform for production of multi-HA influenza VLPs, surpassing the drawbacks of traditional co-infection strategies and/or the use of larger, unstable vectors.

AB Increasing the yield and the productivity in cell culture-based vaccine manufacturing using high-cell-density (HCD) cultivations faces a number of challenges. For example, medium consumption should be low to obtain a very high concentration of viable host cells in an economical way but must be balanced against the requirement that accumulation of toxic metabolites and limitation of nutrients have to be avoided. HCD cultivations should also be optimized to avoid unwanted induction of apoptosis or autophagy during the early phase of virus infection. To realize the full potential of HCD cultivations, a rational analysis of the cultivation conditions of the appropriate host cell line together with the optimal infection conditions for the chosen viral vaccine strain needs to be performed for each particular manufacturing process.
   We here illustrate our strategy for production of the modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus isolate MVA-CR19 in the avian suspension cell line AGE1.CR.pIX at HCD. As a first step we demonstrate that the adjustment of the perfusion rate strictly based on the measured cell concentration and the glucose consumption rate of cells enables optimal growth in a 0.8 L bioreactor equipped with an ATF2 system. Concentrations up to 57 x 10(6) cells/mL (before infection) were obtained with a viability exceeding 95%, and a maximum specific cell growth rate of 0.019 h(-1) (doubling time = 36.5 h). However, not only the cell-specific MVA-CR19 virus yield but also the volumetric productivity was reduced compared to infections at conventional-cell-density (CCD).
   To facilitate optimization of the virus propagation phase at HCD, a larger set of feeding strategies was analyzed in small-scale cultivations using shake flasks. Densities up to 63 x 106 cellsimL were obtained at the end of the cell growth phase applying a discontinuous perfusion mode (semi-perfusion) with the same cell-specific perfusion rate as in the bioreactor (0.060 nL/(cell d)). At this cell concentration, a medium exchange at time of infection was required to obtain expected virus yields during the first 24 h after infection. Applying an additional fed-batch feeding strategy during the whole virus replication phase resulted in a faster virus titer increase during the first 36 h after infection. In contrast, a semi continuous virus harvest scheme improved virus accumulation and recovery at a rather later stage of infection. Overall, a combination of both fed-batch and medium exchange strategies resulted in similar cell-specific virus yields as those obtained for CCD processes but 10-fold higher MVA-CR19 titers, and four times higher volumetric productivity.

AB The recent spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas and the Pacific has reached alarming levels in more than 60 countries. However, relatively little is known about the disease on a virological and epidemiological level and its consequences for humans. Accordingly, a large demand for in vitro derived Brazilian ZIKV material to support in vitro and in vivo studies has arisen. However, a prompt supply of ZIKV and ZIKV antigens cannot be guaranteed as the production of this virus typically using Vero or C6/36 cell lines remains challenging.
   Here we present a production platform based on BHK-21 suspension (BHK-21(sus)) cells to propagate Brazilian ZIKV at larger quantities in perfusion bioreactors. Scouting experiments performed in tissue culture flasks using adherent BHK-21 and Vero cells have demonstrated similar permissivity and virus yields for four different Brazilian ZIKV isolates. The cell-specific yield of infectious virus particles varied between respective virus strains (1-48 PFU/cell), and the ZIKV isolate from the Brazilian state Pernambuco (ZIKV(PE)) showed to be a best performing isolate for both cell lines. However, infection studies of BHK-21sus cells with ZIKVPE in shake flasks resulted in poor virus replication, with a maximum titer of 8.9 x 10(3) PFU/mL. Additional RT-qPCR measurements of intracellular and extracellular viral RNA levels revealed high viral copy numbers within the cell, but poor virus release. Subsequent cultivation in a perfusion bioreactor using an alternating tangential flow filtration system (ATF) under controlled process conditions enabled cell concentrations of about 1.2 x 10(7) cells/mI, and virus titers of 3.9 x 10(7) PFU/mL. However, while the total number of infectious virus particles was increased, the cell-specific yield (3.3 PFU/cell) remained lower than determined in adherent cell lines. Nevertheless, the established perfusion process allows to provide large amounts of ZIKV material for research and is a first step towards process development for manufacturing inactivated or live-attenuated ZIKV vaccines.

AB Since newly emerging influenza viruses with pandemic potentials occurred in recent years, the demand for producing pandemic influenza vaccines for human use is high. For the development of a quick and efficient vaccine production, we proposed an efficient purification platform from the harvest to the purified bulk for the cell-based influenza vaccine production. This platform based on flow-through chromatography and filtration steps and the process only involves a few purification steps, including depth filtration, inactivation by formaldehyde, microfiltration, ultrafiltration, anion-exchange and ligand-core chromatography and sterile filtration. In addition, in the proposed chromatography steps, no virus capture steps were employed, and the purification results were not affected by the virus strain variation, host cells and culturing systems. The results from different virus strains which produced by Vero or MDCK cells in different culturing systems also obtained 33-46% HA recovery yields by this platform. The overall removal rates of the protein and DNA concentration in the purified bulk were over 96.1% and 99.7%, respectively. The low residual cellular DNA concentrations were obtained ranged from 30 to 130 pg per human dose (15 mu g/dose). All influenza H5N1 purified bulks met the regulatory requirements for human vaccine use. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The continuously increasing demand for potent and safe vaccines and the intensifying economic pressure on health care systems underlines the need for further optimization of vaccine manufacturing. Here, we focus on downstream processing of human influenza vaccines, investigating the purification of serum free cell culture-derived influenza virus (A/PR/8/34 H1N1) using continuous chromatography. Therefore, quaternary amine anion exchange monoliths (CIM (R) QA) were characterized for their capacity to capture virus particles from animal cells cultivated in different media and their ability to separate virions from contaminating host cell proteins and DNA. The continuous chromatography was implemented as simulated moving bed chromatography (SMB) in a three zone open loop configuration with a detached high salt zone for regeneration.
   SMBs exploiting 10% and 50% of the monoliths' dynamic binding capacity, respectively, allowed the depletion of >98% of the DNA and >52% of the total protein. Based on the hemagglutination assay (HA assay), the virus yield was higher at 10% capacity use (89% vs. 45%). Both SMB separations resulted in a ratio of total protein to hemagglutinin antigen (based on single radial diffusion assay, SRID assay) below the required levels for manufacturing of human vaccines (less than 10014 of protein per virus strain per dose). The level of contaminating DNA was five-times lower for the 10% loading, but still exceeded the required limit for human vaccines. A subsequent Benzonase treatment step, however, reduced the DNA contamination below 10 ng per dose. Coupled to continuous cultivations for virus propagation, the establishment of integrated processes for fully continuous production of vaccines seems to be feasible. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The World Health Organization's Expanded Programme on Immunization has led to a dramatic rise in worldwide vaccination rates over the past 40 years, yet 19.4 million infants remain underimmunized each year. Many of these infants have received at least one vaccine dose but may remain unprotected because they did not receive subsequent booster doses due to logistical challenges. This study aimed to develop injectable controlled release microparticles with kinetics that mimic common vaccine dosing regimens consisting of large antigen doses administered periodically over the course of months in order to eliminate the need for boosters. Sixteen poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microsphere formulations containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model vaccine antigen were screened in vitro to determine their respective release kinetics. Three formulations that exhibited desirable pulsatile release profiles were then selected for studying immunogenicity in mice. Two low-dose microsphere formulations induced peak anti-BSA IgG antibody titers of 13.9 +/- 1.3 and 13.7 +/- 2.2 log(2) compared to 15.5 +/- 1.5 log(2) for a series of three bolus injections delivered at 0, 4, and 8 weeks with an equivalent cumulative dose. Similarly, high-dose formulations induced peak antibody titers that were 16.1 +/- 2.1 log(2) compared to 17.7 +/- 2.2 log(2) for controls. All three microparticle formulations studied in vivo induced peak antibody titers that were statistically similar to bolus controls. These results suggest that pulsatile antigen release from polymeric microparticles is a promising approach for single-injection vaccination, which could potentially reduce the logistical burden associated with immunization in the developing world.

AB A combination experimental approach, utilizing semi-empirical excipient screening followed by statistical modeling using design of experiments (DOE), was undertaken to identify stabilizing candidate formulations for a lyophilized live attenuated Flavivirus vaccine candidate. Various potential pharmaceutical compounds used in either marketed or investigative live attenuated viral vaccine formulations were first identified. The ability of additives from different categories of excipients, either alone or in combination, were then evaluated for their ability to stabilize virus against freeze-thaw, freeze-drying, and accelerated storage (25 degrees C) stresses by measuring infectious virus titer. An exploratory data analysis and predictive DOE modeling approach was subsequently undertaken to gain a better understanding of the interplay between the key excipients and stability of virus as well as to determine which combinations were interacting to improve virus stability. The lead excipient combinations were identified and tested for stabilizing effects using a tetravalent mixture of viruses in accelerated and real time (2-8 degrees C) stability studies. This work demonstrates the utility of combining semi -empirical excipient screening and DOE experimental design strategies in the formulation development of lyophilized live attenuated viral vaccine candidates.

AB The phrase "Process is the Product" is often applied to biologics, including multicomponent vaccines composed of complex components that evade complete characterization. Vaccine production processes must be defined and locked early in the development cycle to ensure consistent quality of the vaccine throughout scale-up, clinical studies, and commercialization. This approach of front-loading the development work helped facilitate the accelerated approval of the Biologic License Application for the well characterized vaccine bivalent rLP2086 (Trumenba (R), Pfizer Inc) in 2014 under Breakthrough Therapy Designation. Bivalent rLP2086 contains two rLP2086 antigens and is licensed for the prevention of meningococcal meningitis disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B in individuals 10-25 years of age in the United States. This paper discusses the development of the manufacturing process of the two antigens for the purpose of making it amenable to any manufacturing facility. For the journey to commercialization, the operating model used to manage this highly accelerated program led to a framework that ensured "right the first time" execution, robust process characterization, and proactive process monitoring. This framework enabled quick problem identification and proactive resolutions, resulting in a robust control strategy for the commercial process.

AB Although its powerful impact on most co-morbidities has been widely demonstrated, the metabolic outcomes of bariatric surgery (BS) show a great heterogeneity among patients. Haplotypes of one of the major antioxidant enzyme, catalase (CAT), are associated with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. The haplotype referred to as CAT1 includes homozygous carriers of CATH1 [-844G,-89A,-20T], whereas CAT2 haplotype includes heterozygous carriers (CATH1/CATH2) and CATH2 homozygous [-844A,-89T,-20C]. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of CAT1 and CAT2 haplotypes on traditional cardiovascular and metabolic markers one year after BS in a women population. The 294 women with a body mass index (BMI) > 35 kg/m2 were followed-up for one year after BS, monitoring their anthropometric, metabolic and inflammatory parameters. CAT1 patients had significantly improved diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and Creactive protein (CRP) levels compared to CAT2 one year after BS. In untreated women at baseline, the change of CRP one year after BS was higher in CAT1 patients. In the population of women receiving at least one anti-lipidic, anti-hypertensive or anti-diabetic treatment at baseline, DBP and fat mass were lower one year after BS in CAT1 patients and the greater change of fat mass was associated with a higher change of adiponectin. The results highlight the beneficial impact of the CAT1 haplotype on traditional cardiovascular and metabolic parameters after BS. Our findings suggest that the CAT1 haplotype could be implicated in the level of metabolic and cardiovascular improvement after BS.

AB Molecular diagnostics is of critical importance to public health worldwide. It facilitates not only detection and characterization of diseases, but also monitors drug responses, assists in the identification of genetic modifiers and disease susceptibility. Based upon DNA variation, a wide range of molecular-based tests are available to assess/diagnose diseases. The CRISPR-Cas9 system has recently emerged as a versatile tool for biological and medical research. In this system, a single guide RNA (sgRNA) directs the endonuclease Cas9 to a targeted DNA sequence for site-specific manipulation. As designing CRISPR-guided nucleases can be done easily and relatively fast, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has evolved as widely used DNA editing tool. This technique led to a large number of gene editing studies in variety of organisms. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated diagnosis and therapy has picked up pace due to specificity and accuracy of CRISPR. The aim is not only to identify specific pathogens, especially virus but also to repair disease-causing alleles by changing the DNA sequence at the exact location on the chromosome. At present, PCR-based molecular diagnostic testing predominates; however, alternative technologies aimed at reducing genome complexity without PCR are anticipated to gain momentum in the coming years. Furthermore, development of integrated chip devices should allow point-of-care testing and facilitate genetic readouts from single cells and molecules. Together with molecular based therapy CRISPR based diagnostic testing will be a revolution in modern health care settings. In this review, we emphasize on current developing diagnostic techniques based upon CRISPR Cas approach along with short insights on its therapeutic usage.

AB Small RNAs (sRNAs) in bacteria have evolved with diverse mechanisms to balance their target gene expression in response to changes in the environment. Accumulating studies on bacterial regulatory processes firmly established that sRNAs modulate their target gene expression generally at the posttranscriptional level. Identification of large number of sRNAs by advanced technologies, like deep sequencing, tilling microarray, indicates the existence of a plethora of distinctive sRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms in bacteria. Types of the novel mechanisms are increasing with the discovery of new sRNAs. Complementary base pairing between sRNAs and target RNAs assisted by RNA chaperones like Hfq and ProQ, in many occasions, to regulate the cognate gene expression is prevalent in sRNA mechanisms. sRNAs, in most studied cases, can directly base pair with target mRNA to remodel its expression. Base pairing can happen either in the untranslated regions or in the coding regions of mRNA to activate/repress its translation. sRNAs also act as target mimic to titrate away different regulatory RNAs from its target. Other mechanism includes the sequestration of regulatory proteins, especially transcription factors, by sRNAs. Numerous sRNAs, following analogous mechanism, are widespread in bacteria, and thus, has drawn immense attention for the development of RNA-based technologies. Nevertheless, typical sRNA mechanisms are also discovered to be confined in some bacteria. Analysis of the sRNA mechanisms unravels their existence in both the single step processes and the complex regulatory networks with a global effect on cell physiology. This review deals with the diverse array of mechanisms, which sRNAs follow to maintain bacterial lifestyle.

AB Environmental disruption of the circadian rhythm is linked with increased pain due to osteoarthritis (OA). We aimed to characterize the role of the clock gene in OA-induced pain more systemically using both genetic and pharmacological approaches. Genetically modified mice, (bmallf/fNavl.8CreERT mice), generated by deleting the critical clock gene, bmall, from Nav1.8 sensory neurons, were resistant to the development of mechanical hyperalgesia associated with OA induced by partial medial meniscectomy (PMM) of the knee. In wild-type mice, induction of OA by PMM surgery led to a substantial increase in BMAL1 expression in DRG neurons. Interestingly, pharmacological activation of the REV-ERB (a negative regulator of bmall transcription) with SR9009 resulted in reduction of BMAL1 expression, and a significant decrease in mechanical hyperalgesia associated with OA. Cartilage degeneration was also significantly reduced in mice treated with the REV-ERB agonist SR9009. Based on these data, we also assessed the effect of pharmacological activation of REV-ERB using a model of environmental circadian disruption with its associated mechanical hyperalgesia, and noted that SR9009 was an effective analgesic in this model as well. Our data clearly demonstrate that genetic disruption of the molecular clock, via deletion of bmall in the sensory neurons of the DRG, decreases pain in a model of OA. Furthermore, pharmacological activation of REV-ERB leading to suppression of BMAL1 expression may be an effective method for treating OA-related pain, as well as to reduce joint damage associated with this disease.

AB Selection of informative genes from high dimensional gene expression data has emerged as an important research area in genomics. Many gene selection techniques have been proposed so far are either based on relevancy or redundancy measure. Further, the performance of these techniques has been adjudged through post selection classification accuracy computed through a classifier using the selected genes. This performance metric may be statistically sound but may not be biologically relevant. A statistical approach, i.e. Boot-MRMR, was proposed based on a composite measure of maximum relevance and minimum redundancy, which is both statistically sound and biologically relevant for informative gene selection. For comparative evaluation of the proposed approach, we developed two biological sufficient criteria, Le. Gene Set Enrichment with QTL (GSEQ) and biological similarity score based on Gene Ontology (GO). Further, a systematic and rigorous evaluation of the proposed technique with 12 existing gene selection techniques was carried out using five gene expression datasets. This evaluation was based on a broad spectrum of statistically sound (e.g. subject classification) and biological relevant (based on QTL and GO) criteria under a multiple criteria decision-making framework. The performance analysis showed that the proposed technique selects informative genes which are more biologically relevant. The proposed technique is also found to be quite competitive with the existing techniques with respect to subject classification and computational time. Our results also showed that under the multiple criteria decision-making setup, the proposed technique is best for informative gene selection over the available alternatives. Based on the proposed approach, an R Package, i.e. BootMRMR has been developed and available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BootMRMR. This study will provide a practical guide to select statistical techniques for selecting informative genes from high dimensional expression data for breeding and system biology studies.

   EXPRESSION
AB For the biological production of L-ribulose, conversion by enzymes or resting cells has been investigated. However, expensive or concentrated substrates, an additional purification step to remove borate and the requirement for cell cultivation and harvest steps before utilization of resting cells make the production process complex and unfavorable. Microbial fermentation may help overcome these limitations. In this study, we constructed a genetically engineered Candida tropicalis strain to produce L-ribulose by fermentation with a glucose/L-arabinose mixture. For the uptake of L-arabinose as a substrate and conversion of L-arabinose to L-ribulose, two heterologous genes coding for L-arabinose transporter and L-arabinose isomerase, were constitutively expressed in C. tropicalis under the GAPDH promoter. The Arabidopsis thaliana-originated L-arabinose transporter gene (STP2)-expressing strain exhibited a high L-arabinose uptake rate of 0.103 g/g cell/h and the expression of L-arabinose isomerase from Lactobacillus sakei 23 K showed 30% of conversion (9 g/L) from 30 g/L of L-arabinose. This genetically engineered strain can be used for L-ribulose production by fermentation using mixed sugars of glucose and L-arabinose.

ID ASSEMBLIES; ANNOTATION
AB The strain Bifidobacterium choerinum FMB-1, a bacterium with a strong ability to degrade resistant starch (RS), was isolated from rumen fluids of Korean native cattle (Bos taurus coreanae). Degradation experiments revealed that it could degrade approximately 80% of native granular starches within 8 h. Although B. choerinum has strong RS degradation abilities, a completed genomic resource has not yet been proposed. Here we present the complete whole genome data of B. choerinum FMB-1. It consists of a circular chromosome (2,257,294 bp) and one plasmid (11,012 bp). Genome analysis revealed that at least 11 protein-coding genes were related to alpha-glucan degradation. The abundance of these genes may affect the efficacy of granular starch degradation. We also found the existence of antimicrobial resistance genes in the genome, which were not reported in other B. choerinum genomes. The whole genome information of B. choerinum FMB-1 could improve the understanding of the RS degradation mechanism of bovine gut microorganisms.

AB We fabricated a microRNA biosensor using the combination of surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and electrochemical (EC) techniques. For the first time, the weaknesses of each techniques for microRNA detection was compensated by the other ones to give rise to the specific and wide-range detection of miR-155. A single stranded 3' methylene blue (MB) and 5' thiol-modified RNA (MB-ssRNA-SH) was designed to detect the target miR-155 and immobilized onto the gold nanoparticle-modified ITO (ITO/GNP). Upon the invasion of target strand, the double-stranded RNA transformed rapidly to an upright structure resulting in a notable decrease in SERS and redox signals of the MB. For the first time, by combination of SERS and EC techniques in a single platform we extended the dynamic range of both techniques from 10 pM to 450 nM (SERS: 10 pM-5 nM and EC: 5 nM-450 nM). As well, the SERS technique improved the detection limit of the EC method from 100 pM to 100 fM, while the EC method covered single-mismatch detection which was the SERS deficiency. The fabricated single-step biosensor possessing a good capability of miRNA detection in human serum, could be employed throughout the broad ranges of biomedical and bioelectronics applications.

AB Phycoerythrobilin (PEB) is an open-chain tetrapyrrole derived from heme and plays an important role as light-harvesting pigment in the phycobiliproteins of cyanobacteria and red algae. Furthermore, PEB can also function as an antioxidant with potential use as a natural acid stable food colorant. PEB is not commercially available and large, pure quantities can only be obtained by laborious methanolysis of red algae followed by liquid chromatography. Here we describe an improved method for high yield production and purification of PEB in Escherichia coli via heterologous expression where the two required enzymes heme oxygenase and PEB synthase subsequently convert the substrate heme provided by the host cell. Experiments in shaking flasks resulted in the highest product yield of 680.23 +/- 42.75 mu g PEB per g cell dry weight, by induction with 0.1mM IPTG. Scale-up to batch-operated fermentation in a 2 L bioreactor reached product concentrations up to 5.02 mg PEB L-1 by adjustment of aeration, induction time, media composition and supplementation of precursors. A further approach included separation of PEB from developed foam above the culture. This enabled continuous product collection during cultivation and simplified product purification. Produced PEB was validated via UV-vis spectroscopy, high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.

AB Tyrosinase is a key rate-limiting enzyme in melanin synthesis. In this study, a new tyrosinase gene (Tyr) was identified from Pteria penguin and its effect on melanin synthesis was deliberated by RNA interference (RNAi). The cDNA of PpTyr was 1728 bp long, containing a 5'untranslated region (UTR) of 11 bp, a 3'UTR of 295 bp, and an open reading fragment of 1422 bp encoding 473 amino acids. Amino acid alignment showed PpTyr had the highest (50%) identity to tyrosinase-like protein 1 from Pinctada fucata. Phylogenetic tree analysis classified PpTyr into alpha-subclass of type-3 copper protein. Tissue expression analysis indicated that PpTyr was highly expressed in mantle, a nacre formation related tissue. After PpTyr RNA interference, PpTyr mRNA was significantly inhibited by 71.0% (P < 0.05). For other melanin-related genes, PpCreb2 and PpPax3 expression showed no significant change, but PpBcl2 was obviously increased. By liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) analysis, the total content of PDCA (pyrrole-2, 3-dicarboxylic acid) and PTCA (pyrrole-2,3,5-tricarboxylic acid), as main markers for eumelanin, was sharply decreased by 66.6% after PpTyr RNAi (P < 0.05). The percentage of PDCA was also obviously decreased from 20.1% to 13.9%. This indicated that tyrosinase played a key role in melanin synthesis and color formation of P. penguin.

AB The sine oculis homeobox homolog 4 (SIX4) gene belongs to the SIX gene family, which plays a critical role in muscle regeneration and early stages of ontogeny. This study aimed to detect promoter variations of bovine SIX4 genes in Qinchuan cattle, and to evaluate the effect of transcription regulations and body measurement traits. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) results showed that the mRNA expression levels of SIX4 gene were found significantly highest in longissimus thoracic tissue and individual before attaining the stage of physiological maturity. Using sequencing technology on a total of 428 Qinchuan cattle, seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the promoter region of SIX4, and seven haplotypes representing 18 potential transcription factor compositions of polymorphic potential cis-acting elements. Association analysis indicated that the H-3-H-3 diplotype performed greater withers height, chest depth, chest circumference, back fat thickness and ultrasound loin muscle area (P < 0.05) than H-5-H-6, which were consistent with the promoter activity of Hap3 haplotype was higher than the Hap5 and Hap6 haplotype in vitro. These potential transcription factor information and combined genotypes H-3-H-3 of the SIX4 gene can be used as a molecular marker for selection of economic traits in Qinchuan cattle.

AB Self-renewal is essential for the malignant biological behaviors of colorectal cancer stem cells. While the self renewal molecular mechanisms of colorectal cancer stem cells are not yet fully understood. Recently, miRNAs are reported to be relevant to the self-renewal ability of cancer stem cells. In this study, we first isolated colorectal cancer stem cell from colorectal cancer cell line HCT-116 by 1% low serum culture. Then we conducted a comprehensive analysis based on the miRNAs profiles data of both colorectal cancer stem cells and normal cultured colorectal cancer cells. Pathway analysis revealed multiple pathways including Jak-STAT, TGF-beta, PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathway that are correlated to colorectal cancer. Further, we constructed a miRNA-mRNA network, based on which, several miRNA/mRNA pairs were ranked according to their impact index to the self-renewal of colorectal cancer stem cells. Further biological experiment showed that up-regulation of miR-92a-3p led to cell cycle arrest and reduced colony formation. This work provides clues to find the new potential biomarkers for colorectal cancer stem cell diagnosis and select effective miRNAs for targeted therapy.

AB Giant clams harbor symbiotic zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium), which are nitrogen-deficient, mainly in the fleshy and colorful outer mantle. This study aimed to sequence and characterize the algal Glutamine Synthetase (GS) and Glutamate Synthase (GLT), which constitute the glutamate synthase cycle (or GS-GOGAT cycle, whereby GOGAT is the protein acronym of GLT) of nitrogen assimilation, from the outer mantle of the fluted giant clam, Tridacna squamosa. We had identified a novel GS-like cDNA coding sequence of 2325 bp, and named it as T. squamosa Symbiodinium GS1 (TSSGSI). The deduced TSSGS1 sequence had 774 amino acids with a molecular mass of 85 kDa, and displayed the characteristics of GS1 and Nucleotide Diphosphate Kinase. The cDNA coding sequence of the algal GLT, named as T. squamosa Symbiodinium GLT (TSSGLT), comprised 6399 bp, encoding a protein of 2133 amino acids and 232.4 kDa. The zooxanthellal origin of TSSGS1 and TSSGOGAT was confirmed by sequence comparison and phylogenetic analyses. Indeed, TSSGSI and TSSGOGAT were expressed predominately in the outer mantle, which contained the majority of the zooxanthellae. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed the expression of TSSGS1 and TSSGOGAT in the cytoplasm and the plastids, respectively, of the zooxanthellae in the outer mantle. It can be concluded that the symbiotic zooxanthellae of T. squamosa possesses a glutamate synthase (TSSGS1-TSSGOGAT) cycle that can assimilate endogenous ammonia produced by the host clam into glutamate, which can act as a substrate for amino acid syntheses. Thus, our results provide insights into why intact giant clam-zooxanthellae associations do not excrete ammonia under normal circumstances.

AB C-RAF was the first member of the RAF kinase family to be discovered. Since its discovery, C-RAF has been found to regulate many fundamental cell processes, such as cell proliferation, cell death, and metabolism. However, the majority of these functions are achieved through interactions with different proteins; the genes regulated by C-RAF in its active or inactive state remain unclear. In the work, we used RNA-seq analysis to study the global transcriptomes of C-RAF bearing or C-RAF knockout cells in quiescent or EGF activated states. We identified 3353 genes that are promoted or suppressed by C-RAF. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses revealed that these genes are involved in drug addiction, cardiomyopathy, autoimmunity, and regulation of cell metabolism. Our results provide a panoramic view of C-RAF function, including known and novel functions, and have revealed potential targets for elucidating the role of C-RAF.

AB Hong Kong grouper (Epinephelus akaara) is an important commercially cultured marine fish in Asia, and a protogynous hermaphrodite with the "diandry" pattern. In order to explore the gene expression patterns of hypothalamus and pituitary between male and female Hong Kong grouper, we used RNA-seq technology to investigate transcriptomes of both tissues in immature and mature male and female adults. This produced 227,227,148 and 215,858,948 high quality reads from hypothalamus and pituitary, which were jointly assembled into 199,203 unigenes. Among them, 30,786 unigenes were mapped to known genes. Differential expression analysis revealed 275 unigenes that were differentially expressed between immature male and female adults and 561 between mature male and female adults. According to annotation and KEGG information, these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were involved in development, metabolism, and regulation of transcription. One DEG, amino-terminal enhancer of split (AES), a member of the Groucho/transducin-like enhancer of split family of transcriptional regulators that played important roles in neurogenesis, segmentation, and sex determination, was significantly upregulated in male individuals in both immature and mature adult comparisons, indicating it may be involved in male reproductive function during development. Our report, for the first time, uses RNA-seq technology to investigate transcriptomes of both hypothalamus and pituitary in teleost fish, and provides a basis for further studies of molecular mechanism of sex determination and development in Hong Kong grouper.

AB Background: Immunological alterations and dysregulation of the inflammatory response have been suggested to play a crucial role in schizophrenia pathophysiology. Growing evidence supports the involvement of chemokines in brain development, thus many chemokines have been studied in relation with schizophrenia. The C-C motif chemokine ligand 11 (CCL11) has been shown to be related with synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis. Moreover, altered levels of CCL11 have been observed in schizophrenia patients. Therefore, we examined whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the CCL11 in the promoter region contribute to susceptibility to schizophrenia.
   Methods: Four promoter SNPs [rs17809012 (-384T > C), rs16969415 (-426C > T), rs17735961 (-488C > A), and rs4795896 (576G > A)] were genotyped in 254 schizophrenia patients and 405 control subjects using Fluidigm SNPtype assays.
   Results: The genotype frequency of CCL11 rs4795896 (-576G > A) showed significant association with schizophrenia in a recessive model (AA vs. GG/AG, p < 0.0001) and in a log-additive model (AG vs. AA vs. GG, p < 0.0001). The allele frequency of rs4795896 also showed a significant association with schizophrenia (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed that GCT, ACT, and GCC haplotypes containing rs4795896, rs17735961 and rs17809012 were significantly associated with schizophrenia (p = 0.0044, p < 0.0001, and p < 0.0001, respectively).
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that CCL11 promotor polymorphism is associated with increased risk for the development of schizophrenia in a Korean population.

AB Congenital hypoplastic bone marrow failure is a rare condition in neonates. The genetics and mechanisms behind are largely obscure.
   Here we characterize a neonate presenting with congenital thrombocytopenia and anemia. During the first 2-4 weeks after birth the neonate developed severe neutropenia while the lymphoid lineages were unaffected. The neonate was without dysmorphic signs. A de novo mono-allelic constitutional microdeletion of 175.1 kb at 3q26.2 affecting exon 2 of MECOM, involving MDS1 but not EVI1, was identified as the only copy number alteration by oligo-based array-CGH analysis. Expression analysis showed profoundly reduced expression of multiple MECOM transcripts in the bone marrow cells. Whole exome sequencing detected no pathogenic mutations in genes known to be associated with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes. The patient was successfully treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at 5 months of age.
   Interstitial deletions encompassing the 3q26.2 region are very rare. A literature search revealed two previous cases with microdeletions involving this region, and the cases were associated with congenital thrombocytopenia and anemia, but unaffected lymphopoiesis. Together these data indicate that MECOM may be important for normal myeloid hematopoiesis in humans but dispensable for lymphoid differentiation. We suggest that partial deletion in MECOM may be a primary event associated with congenital pancytopenia.

AB Unicellular flagellates that make up the class Kinetoplastida include multiple parasites responsible for public health concerns, including Trypanosoma brucei and T. cruzi (agents of African sleeping sickness and Chagas disease, respectively), and various Leishmania species, which cause leishmaniasis. These diseases are generally difficult to eradicate, with treatments often having lethal side effects and/or being effective only during the acute phase of the diseases, when most patients are still asymptomatic. Phospholipid signaling and metabolism are important in the different life stages of Trypanosoma, including playing a role in transitions between stages and in immune system evasion, thus, making the responsible enzymes into potential therapeutic targets. However, relatively little is understood about how the pathways function in these pathogens. Thus, in this study we examined evolutionary history of proteins from one such signaling pathway, namely phospholipase D (PLD) homologs. PLD is an enzyme responsible for synthesizing phosphatidic acid (PA) from membrane phospholipids. PA is not only utilized for phospholipid synthesis, but is also involved in many other signaling pathways, including biotic and abiotic stress response. 37 different representative Kinetoplastida genomes were used for an exhaustive search to identify putative PLD homologs. The genome of Bodo saltans was the only one of surveyed Kinetoplastida genomes that encoded a protein that clustered with plant PLDs. The representatives from other Kinetoplastida species clustered together in two different clades, thought to be homologous to the PLD super family, but with shared sequence similarity with cardiolipin synthases (CLS), and phosphatidylserine synthases (PSS). The protein structure predictions showed that most Kinetoplastida sequences resemble CLS and PSS, with the exception of 5 sequences from Bodo saltans that shared significant structural similarities with the PLD sequences, suggesting the loss of PLD-like sequences during the evolution of parasitism in kinetoplastids. On the other hand, diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) homologs were identified for all species examined in this study, indicating that DGK could be the only pathway for the synthesis of PA involved in lipid signaling in these organisms due to genome streamlining during transition to parasitic lifestyle. Our findings offer insights for development of potential therapeutic and/or intervention approaches, particularly those focused on using PA, PLD and/or DGK related pathways, against trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease.

AB Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway has pivotal role in repair of double-strand DNA breaks that may lead to carcinogenesis. XRCC4 is one of the essential proteins of this pathway and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of this gene are reported to be associated with cancer risks. In our study, we first used computational approaches to predict the damaging variants of XRCC4 gene. Tools predicted rs79561451 (S110P) nsSNP as the most deleterious SNP. Along with this SNP, we analysed other two SNPs (rs3734091 and rs6869366) to study their association with breast cancer in population of West India. Variant rs3734091 was found to be significantly associated with breast cancer while rs6869366 variant did not show any association. These SNPs may influence the susceptibility of individuals to breast cancer in this population.

AB The effects of microRNAs on PTEN levels are characteristic for many types of cancer. However, the picture of the correlation between the expression levels of PTEN and its targeting microRNAs in endometrial cancer is not fully presented. Our study investigated and analysed the expression levels of PTEN and PTEN-targeting miR-21, miR-181a, miR-214, miR-301a, and miR-1908 in total of 78 samples, out of which 26 samples were from normal endometrium, whereas the 52 samples were from endometrial cancer samples. Our results demonstrated a high variability of individual endometrial cancer samples in the levels of PTEN. The level of miR-181a showed significant increment in endometrial cancer tissues in comparison with normal endometrium. We did not observe any statistically significant correlation between levels of microRNAs and PTEN in a heterogeneous cohort of patients. At the same time, in samples collected from endometrial cancer patients, it was found out that the relationship between PTEN expression and body mass index had significant positive correlation. Moreover, our data demonstrated that the expression of PTEN was significantly decreased, whereas expression of miR-181a was significantly over-expressed in non-obese compared to obese endometrial cancer patients. Additionally, we observed the relationship between PTEN levels and miR-181a related to the cancerous tissues for non-obese patients was established to be negatively correlated. Our findings suggest that decrease of PTEN via increase of miR-181a may be important contributor to endometrial cancer in non-obese patients.

AB Aims: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate microRNA-140-3p expression level in breast cancer patients in comparison to healthy controls.
   Patients & methods: Serum microRNA-140-3p level was quantified by realtime quantitative reverse transcription PCR in 40 women with breast cancer and 40 healthy subjects.
   Results: Serum microRNA-140-3p level in patients compared to healthy subjects was significantly up-regulated (P = 0.01). MicroRNA-140-3p had a good diagnostic accuracy for discrimination of the two groups (AUC = 0.667; sensitivity = 70%; specificity = 50%). Serum microRNA-140-3p level was overexpressed in premenopausal patients who were <= 48 years old. ROC curve showed a similar pattern again (AUC = 0.690; sensitivity = 73%; specificity = 50%).
   Conclusions: microRNA-140-3p has the potential for detection of breast cancer, especially in premenopausal and in <= 48 years old women.

AB The major causes for cataract formation are free radicals, which are neutralized by the endogenous antioxidants. However, how the human lens clean these harmful free radicals is still unclear. Transcriptional factor heat shock factor 4 (HSF4) is a cataract-causing gene and plays important roles during lens development. Here we show that HMOX-1, an anti-oxidase, is a bona fide transcriptional target gene of HSF4 in HLECs (human lens epithelial cells). HSF4 directly binds to the HSE element in HMOX-1 promoter to mediate its mRNA transcription and protein accumulation. The HSE element located at the region of -389 bp to -362 bp upstream from the TSS (transcription start site), which is critical for HMOX-1 transcriptional activation. Furthermore, knockdown of HSF4 by siRNA inhibited HMOX-1 expression. Thus, these data revealed a novel transcription target of HSF4 and provided new insights into anti-oxidation regulation in lens and age-related cataract.

AB MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to, and suppressing the expression of genes. Research show that microRNAs have potential to be used as biomarkers for diagnosis, treatment response and can be used for therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, microRNA expression has effects on immune cell functions, which may lead to disease. Considering the important protective role of neutrophils and B-cells during M.tb infection, we evaluated the expression of microRNAs, known to alter function of these cells, in the context of human TB. We utilised real-time PCR to evaluate the levels of microRNA transcripts in the peripheral blood of TB cases and healthy controls. We found that neutrophil-associated miR-197-3p, miR-99b-5p and miR-191-5p transcript levels were significantly lower in TB cases. Additionally, B-cell-associated miR-320a, miR-204-5p, miR331-3p and other transcript levels were higher in TB cases.
   The miRNAs differentially expressed in neutrophils are predominantly implicated in signalling pathways leading to cytokine productions. Here, the decreased expression in TB cases may imply a lack of suppression on signalling pathways, which may lead to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon gamma. Furthermore, the miRNAs differentially expressed in B-cells are mostly involved in the induction/suppression of apoptosis. Further functional studies are however required to elucidate the significance and functional effects of changes in the expression of these microRNAs.

AB BKCa is a large conductance calcium activated potassium channel ubiquitously expressed in various cell types. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that BKCa is aberrantly expressed in many malignancies, involving in cancerous behaviors such as cell proliferation and migration. In this study, we investigated the functional role of BKCa in endometrial cancer HEC-1-B cells. Overexpression of BKCa by plasmid transfection enhanced endometrial cancer cell proliferation and migration. Conversely, silence of BKCa by lentivirus mediated RNAi system not only inhibited proliferation and migration but also impaired tumor growth in vivo. Patch clamp assay identified the BKCa currents in HEC-1-B cells, which was supported by the observation of channel activation or inhibition in response to the specific opener (NS1619) or blocker (IBTX) of BKCa. Moreover, NS1619 significantly increased cell proliferation and migration while IBTX exhibited the opposite effects. In summary, these data suggested an important role of BKCa in proliferation and migration of endometrial cancer HEC-1-B cells. Thus, BKCa may be established as a potential therapeutic target in endometrial cancer.

AB Introduction: Lithium (Li), a mood stabilizer used to treat bipolar disorder (BP) symptoms has important anti-inflammatory effects by downregulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta). However, sometime Li effect is not efficient in some patients suggesting genetic interference. Previous investigations described association between a genetic superoxide-hydrogen (S-HP) imbalance caused by a superoxide dismutase manganese dependent gene polymorphism (Vail6Ala-SOD2 SNP, rs4880) and differential anti-inflammatory response of some drugs and bioactive molecules. Therefore, we postulated here that S-HP imbalance could present some effect on GSK-3 beta modulation by Li.
   Methods: to test this hypothesis, a genetic and a pharmacological S-HP imbalance protocols were performed. In the two protocols, immune cells were activated by phythohemaglutin (PHA). The first one, used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) cultures carrying different Vall6Ala-SOD2 genotypes, and the second used a commercial macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Macrophages were exposed to paraquat to induce high S levels (VV-like cells) or porphyrin, that is a SOD2-like molecule that increase dismutation of S into HP (AA-like cells). In both protocols the Li effects on GSK-3 beta gene and protein modulation as evaluated in 24 h cultures. The inflammatory activation was also analyzed by cellular proliferation in 72 h cell cultures.
   Results: as expected PHA exposure triggered a strong upregulation of GSK-3 beta gene expression (p <= 0.001), and Li exposure showed GSK-3 beta gene downregulation from 0.7 mEq/L concentrations. However, Li modulatory effects on GSk-3 beta gene and protein expression was directly influenced by basal S-HP balance. Presence of high S basal levels (VV genotype and VV-like cells) induced attenuated Li anti-inflammatory effects in comparison with balanced and AA and AA-like cells (p < 0.001). Despite methodological limitations related to in vitro assays, the whole of results suggested that Li anti-inflammatory effects is influenced by S-HP basal state and is plausible that its influence could contributes to resistance of some patients to Li treatment or to increase of intensity of some side effects Li-associated.

AB The explosive growth in genomic data has provided novel insights into the conflicting signals hidden in phylogenetic trees. Although some studies have explored the effects of the GC content and parsimony informative sites (PIS) on the phylogenetic tree, the effect of the heterogeneity of the GC content at the first/second/third codon position on parsimony informative sites (GC1/2/3(PIS)) among different species and the effect of PIS on phylogenetic tree construction remain largely unexplored. Here, we used two different mammal genomic datasets to explore the patterns of GC1/2/3(PIS) heterogeneity and the effect of PIS on the phylogenetic tree of genes: (i) all GC1/2/3(PIS) have obvious heterogeneity between different mammals, and the levels of heterogeneity are GC3(PIS) > GC2(PIS) > GC1(PIS); (ii) the number of PIS is positively correlated with the metrics of "good" gene tree topologies, and excluding the third codon position (C3) decreases the quality of gene trees by removing too many PIS. These results provide novel insights into the heterogeneity pattern of GC1/2/3(PIS) in mammals and the relationship between GC3/(PIS) and gene trees. Additionally, it is necessary to carefully consider whether to exclude C3 to improve the quality of gene trees, especially in the super-tree method.

AB Thalassemia is one of the most common hereditary blood disorders. Epidemiological data regarding the prevalence and distribution of mutations is important for planning a thalassemia control program. To reveal the prevalence of thalassemia and mutation spectrum in the Yulin region of southern China, we screened 130,318 individuals from Yulin region by hematological and genetic analysis. Totally, 24,886 (19.10%) subjects were diagnosed with thalassemia, including 16,308 (12.51%) subjects with alpha-thalassemia alone, 6658 (5.11%) subjects with beta-thalassemia alone and 1920 (1.47%) subjects with both alpha- and beta-thalassemia. Ten alpha-thalassemia mutations were identified in the alpha-thalassemia subjects, with the common alpha-thalassemia mutations being-(SEA) mutation (51.91%), -alpha(3.7) (19.90%), alpha(cs)alpha (10.58%), -alpha 4.2 (8.13%), alpha(ws)alpha (7.67%). Thirteen beta-thalassemia mutations and 31 genotypes were characterized in the beta-thalassemia subjects. The seven common mutations [CD41-42 (-CTIT) (43.31%), CD17 (A > T) (34.58%), CD26 (G > A) (6.86%), CD71-72 (+A) (4.25%), -28 (A > G) (3.90%), IVS-II-654 (C > T) (3.53%) and IVS-I-1 (G > T) (2.22%)] accounted for 98.65% of all beta-thalassemia defects. Furthermore, 6 cases of alpha-triplication and 3 cases of mutation-alpha(2.4) were first identified in this region. Our data illustrated that there was great heterogeneity and extensive spectrum of thalassemias in the Yulin populations. The findings will contribute an available reference for prevention of thalassemia in this region.

AB Lamb-Shaffer syndrome (OMIM: 616803) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental delay, mild to moderate intellectual disability, speech delay, and mild characteristic facial appearance caused by SOX5 haploinsufficiency on chromosome 12p12.1. There are clinical variabilities among the patients with genomic alterations, such as intragenic deletions, a point mutation, and a chromosomal translocation of 1(11;12) (p13;p12.1), in SOX5. We report herein a 5-year-old Japanese male with a de novo balanced reciprocal trans location t(12;20)(p12.1;p12.3) presenting a mild intellectual disability, speech delay, characteristic facial appearance, and autistic features. We determined the translocation breakpoints of the patient to be in intron 4 of SOX5 and the intergenic region in 20p12.3 via FISH and nucleotide sequence analyses. Thus, the present patient has SOX5 haploinsufficiency affecting 2 long forms of SOX5 and is the second reported case of Lamb-Shaffer syndrome caused by a de novo balanced reciprocal translocation. This report confirmed that haploinsufficiency of the 2 long forms of SOX5 presents common clinical features, including mild intellectual disability and autistic features, which could be useful for the clinical diagnosis of Lamb-Shaffer syndrome.

AB Recent evidences demonstrate that preoperative chemoradiotherapy (pCRT) followed by mesorectal excision is an effective therapy for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Nevertheless, the predictive molecular biomarkers for the response of patients to CRT remain largely unknown. Here we showed that the expression of miR-519b-3p was correlated with the responsiveness to pCRT in patients with LARC. We found that miR-519b-3p was highly expressed in responsive LARC samples. And we showed that miR-519b-3p may serve as a novel predictive marker by ROC analysis. In addition, overexpression of miR-519b-3p enhanced responsiveness to chemoradiation in vitro. Mechanistically, we found that miR-519b-3p directly bond to the 3' UTR of ARID4B mRNA whose expression was inversely correlated with miR-519b-3p expression. Finally, we performed functional experiments and showed that miR-519b-3p was directly involved in response to pCRT in rectal cancer patients in an ARID4B-dependent way.

AB Human serum albumin one of the most demanded proteins possess an array of clinical and biotechnological applications. Currently, the prime source for HSA production is the human blood which possesses the risk of pathogen contamination and is limited. Thus, there exists an indispensable need to promote non-animal derived HSA production. In the present work, we have exploited the opportunity and promoted the preparation of pathogen-free rHSA from the E. coli host which is blessed with numerous advantages like scalability, cost-effectiveness etc. Upon overcoming the difficulties to produce functional rHSA in E. coli, through engineering the biological system of protein folding in the cell, the E. coli-derived rHSA has been purified to homogeneity. Its detailed physicochemical characterization has been performed, by monitoring its conformational properties, secondary and tertiary structure elements, surface properties, ligand binding properties, stability issues etc. These parameters of the recombinant protein have been compared with the naturally occurring protein from the human source. The outcome of the comparison reveals that the recombinant protein resembles exactly the same as the natural one. Hence, we propose and promote that the E. coli-derived rHSA is an ideal biosimilar for human blood plasma-derived serum albumin.

AB Cupriavidus necator H16 gains increasing attention in microbial research and biotechnological application due to its diverse metabolic features. Here we present a tightly controlled gene expression system for C. necator including the pBBR1-vector that contains hybrid promoters originating from C. necator native tolC-promoter in combination with a synthetic tetO-operator. The expression of the reporter gene from these plasmids relies on the addition of the exogenous inducer doxycycline (dc). The novel expression system offers a combination of advantageous features as; (i) high and dose-dependent recombinant protein production, (ii) tight control with a high dynamic range (On/Off ratio), which makes it applicable for harmful pathways or for toxic protein production, (iii) comparable cheap inducer (doxycycline, dc), (iv) effective at low inducer concentration, that makes it useful for large scale application, (v) rapid, diffusion controlled induction, and (vi) the inducer does not interfere within the cell metabolism. As applications of the expression system in C. necator H16, the growth ability on glycerol was enhanced by constitutively expressing the E. coli glpk gene-encoding for glycerol kinase. Likewise, we used the system to overcome the expression toxicity of mevalonate pathway in C. necator H16. With this system, the mevalonate-genes were successfully introduced in the host and the recombinant strains could produce about 200 mg/l mevalonate.

AB Viral hepatitis caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects millions of people worldwide. The non-structural protein 3 (NS3), one of the most conserved proteins in HCV, is the target of many therapeutic studies. The NS3 protease domain (NS3p) has a range of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes, and synthesizing the protein inside the cells is the most appropriate way to present it to the immune system. We developed a tool to study this kind of presentation, using two vectored particle (VP) systems, one based on the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and the other on HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp), both carrying the protease domain of the NS3 gene. In addition to producing the particles, we developed a method to quantify these VPs using qRT-PCR. We produced batches of approximately 2.4x10(4) SFV-NS3p/mu L and 4.0x10(2) HCVpp-NS3p/mu L. BHK-21 and HuH-7 cells treated with the VPs expressed the NS3 protein, thus showing the functionality of this system.

AB When studying complex interconnected regulatory networks, effective methods for simultaneously manipulating multiple genes expression are paramount. Previously, we have developed a simple method for generation of an all-in-one CRISPR gRNA expression array. We here present a Golden Gate Assembly-based system of synergistic activation mediator (SAM) compatible CRISPR/dCas9 gRNA expression array for the simultaneous activation of multiple genes. Using this system, we demonstrated the simultaneous activation of the transcription factors, TWIST, SNAIL, SLUG, and ZEB1 a human breast cancer cell line.

AB Background: Missed opportunities for vaccination (MOVs) occur when persons eligible for vaccination visit a health facility and do not get the vaccines they need. We conducted a systematic review to assess effects of interventions for reducing MOVs.
   Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in April 2017. Three authors independently screened search outputs, reviewed potentially eligible papers, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data; resolving disagreements by consensus. We expressed study results as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool.
   Results: Six studies (five trials and one cohort study) met our inclusion criteria, all conducted in the United States of America. All six studies had various limitations and were classified as having a high risk of bias. We found moderate certainty evidence that the following interventions probably improve vaccination coverage: patient education (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.38-2.68), patient tracking using community health workers (RR 1.18, 95% Cl 1.11-1.25), and patient tracking and provider prompts (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.18-1.31). In addition, we found low certainty evidence that concurrent interventions targeting health facility (education, prompts, and audit and feedback) and family settings (phone calls) may increase vaccination coverage (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08-1.46).
   Conclusions: The currently available evidence suggests that patient education, patient tracking, outreach sessions, and provider prompts reduce missed opportunities for vaccination and improve vaccination coverage. Rigorous studies are required to confirm these findings and increase the certainty of the current evidence base. WHO is currently coordinating efforts to generate such evidence, especially from low-income and middle-income countries, and it is likely that the data will be available in the next few years.

AB Immune responses to poorly immunogenic antigens, such as polysaccharides, can be enhanced by conjugation to carriers. Our previous studies indicate that conjugation to Vi polysaccharide of Salmonella Typhi may also enhance immunogenicity of some protein carriers. We therefore explored the possibility of generating a bivalent vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum malaria and typhoid fever, which are co-endemic in many parts of the world, by conjugating Vi polysaccharide, an approved antigen in typhoid vaccine, to Pfs25, a malaria transmission blocking vaccine antigen in clinical trials. Vi-Pfs25 conjugates induced strong immune responses against both Vi and Pfs25 in mice, whereas the unconjugated antigens are poorly immunogenic. Functional assays of immune sera revealed potent transmission blocking activity mediated by anti-Pfs25 antibody and serum bactericidal activity due to anti-Vi antibody. Pfs25 conjugation to Vi modified the IgG isotype distribution of antisera, inducing a Th2 polarized immune response against Vi antigen. This conjugate may be further developed as a bivalent vaccine to concurrently target malaria and typhoid fever. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effectiveness of influenza vaccination in the elderly has long been a topic of debate, fueled by the absence of direct evidence from randomized trials on its effect on mortality and the methodological limitations of observational studies pointing this direction. It is argued that new placebo-controlled trials should be undertaken to resolve this uncertainty. However, such trials may be ethically questionable. To bring this discussion forward, we provide a comprehensive overview of the ethical challenges of an influenza vaccine efficacy trial designed to evaluate mortality in the elderly. An important condition in the justification of a trial is the existence of genuine uncertainty in regard to the answer to a research question. Therefore an extensive analysis of the existing levels of knowledge is needed to support the conclusion that an effect of vaccination on mortality is uncertain. Even if a so called "clinical equipoise" status applies, denying a control group vaccination would be problematic because vaccination is considered "competent care" and withholding vaccination could substantially increase patients' risk for influenza and its complications. Given the high burden of disease and already proven benefits of vaccination, such a trial is unlikely to meet the Declaration of Helsinki stating that the importance of a trial must outweigh the risk patients are exposed to. While a placebo-controlled trial in vaccine refusers may be considered, such a trial is unlikely to meet substantial methodological barriers regarding trial size and generalizability. We conclude that a new trial is unlikely to provide for a direct answer, let alone change current policy. At the same time, given the lack of consensus on the ethical acceptability of a placebo-controlled trial on the effect of influenza vaccination on mortality in the elderly, we invite researchers considering such trials to address the ethical challenges discussed in this manuscript.

ID KNOWLEDGE; HESITANCY; PARENTS
AB Background: The attitude towards vaccination is a major determinant of vaccination behavior; this also includes parents' attitudes towards the immunization of their child. Negative attitudes have been associated with vaccine hesitancy and outbreaks of infectious diseases throughout the globe. This study aimed to assess how and why attitudes become more pro-vaccine or vaccine-skeptical over time, and which sources are especially influential in this process.
   Methods: Prospective cohort study with measurements at time of recruitment during pregnancy and at +3, +6 and +14 months after childbirth with cross-sectional control groups. In total, 351 women entered the longitudinal analyses, while 204, 215 and 173 women were recruited in the cross-sectional control groups, respectively. Inclusion criteria were: (i) being at least 18 years of age, (ii) pregnant, (iii) primigravida, and (iv) living in Germany.
   Results: During pregnancy mothers reported rather positive prior experiences with vaccinations. However, their judgment turned significantly more negative after the first vaccination experience with their child. Mixed-effects models showed that these changes were significantly related to increased risk perceptions and concerns about vaccination, which then had a negative impact on the vaccination attitude. In contrast, gaining more vaccine-related knowledge over time positively influenced attitude formation.
   Conclusions: During the first year of their child's life maternal attitudes towards vaccination are formed and guide future decisions whether to vaccinate or not vaccinate a child. Strategies should be implemented that improve mothers' experiences when their newborn is vaccinated to prevent the development of vaccine hesitancy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In vivo potency testing of inactivated poliovirus vaccines (IPV) is generally performed in rats, although no systematic investigation has identified the most appropriate rat strain for anti-poliovirus antibody quantification. We investigated humoral immune responses to IPV in five different rat strains to identify the most suitable strain. Three outbred (Wistar, Wistar Hannover, Sprague-Dawley) and two inbred rat strains (Fisher 344, Wistar Furth) were immunized intramuscularly with a full or one-fifth human dose of commercial IPV. Anti-poliovirus neutralizing antibody (NA) titers were measured using Salk and Sabin virus neutralizing assays. Post-vaccination responses varied between strains; inbred strains showed greater animal-to-animal variation in NA responses than outbred strains, Virus NA titers persisted for 9 weeks with little reduction in the response. The outbred Wistar rat model was identified as the preferred strain for IPV potency testing based on its capacity to produce high, dose-dependent antipoliovirus NA responses, with low animal-to-animal variation.

AB Brucella abortus is the etiological agent of brucellosis, a zoonotic disease affecting cattle and humans. This disease has been partially controlled in cattle by immunization with live attenuated B. abortus S19 and RB51 strains. However, use of these vaccine strains has been associated with safety issues in animals and humans, New vaccines have since emerged in the prevention of brucellosis, particularly DNA vaccines, which have shown effectiveness and a good safety profile. Their protection efficacy in mice is associated with the induction of Th1 type and cytotoxic T cell mediated immune response against structural antigens and virulence factors expressed during B. abortus infection, Some antigenic candidate for vaccine design against brucellosis (mainly DNA vaccines) have been obtained from genomic island 3 (Gl-3) of B. abortus, which encodes several open reading frames (ORFs) involved in the intracellular survival and virulence of this pathogen. The immunogenicity and protection conferred by these DNA vaccines in a murine model is reviewed in this article, suggesting that some of them could be safe and effective vaccine candidates against to prevent B. abortus infection.

AB Practical methods to measure the potency of influenza vaccines are needed as alternatives for the standard single radial immunodiffusion (SRID) assay. VaxArray assays for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) have been developed to address this need. In this report, we evaluate the use of these assays to assess the potency of HA and NA of an A/H3N2 subunit vaccine by determining the correlation between the amounts measured by VaxArray and the immunogenicity in mice. The antibody response after one and two doses of five formulations of the vaccine ranging from 5 pg/mL to 80 pg/mL of HA, was measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) assays. For hemagglutinin, vaccine potency determined by VaxArray was equivalent to potency measured SRID and these amounts were predictive of immunogenicity, with excellent correlation between potency measured by VaxArray and the HAI geometric mean titers (GMT). Likewise, the amount of NA measured by VaxArray was predictive of the NAI GMT. The VaxArray NA assay reported non-detectable levels of intact NA for a sample that had been heat degraded at 56 degrees C for 20 h, demonstrating that the assay measures the native, active form of NA. Similarly, the HA potency measured by VaxArray in this heat-treated sample was very low when a monoclonal antibody was used to detect the amount of antigen bound. Importantly, the force degraded sample induced low HAI titers and the NAI titers were not measurable, supporting the conclusion that the VaxArray HA and NA assays measure the immunogenic forms of these A/H3N2 antigens. This study indicates that VaxArray assays can be used to assess the potency of HA and NA components in influenza vaccines as a proxy for immunogenicity. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB Background: Motivated by the unexplained variation in the performance of some vaccines across different settings, we extend previous theoretical work to consider the potential impact of incomplete case ascertainment on measures of vaccine efficacy (VE), which is more likely in subclinical or clinically unimportant infections, such as rotavirus gastroenteritis.
   Methods: By simulating the measurement of VE under outbreak conditions using a discrete time stochastic SIR model, we compare three commonly used measures, VERisk, VERate and VEHazard, calculated respectively based on risk ratio, rate ratio and hazard ratio of disease. We investigate how these measures are influenced by factors such as biological activity, action mechanism of vaccine, proportion of cases ascertained, and underlying force of infection.
   Results: Under plausibly low levels of ascertainment, the group with the most infections, and therefore the most missed cases, has the most falsely inflated denominator, producing similar rates in the control and intervention groups. As a result, VERare and VEHazard will underestimate the true VE compared to high case ascertainment scenarios. Furthermore, the extent of underestimation is greater for leaky vaccine models with lower biological protective effects and under conditions which are conducive to high transmission.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a biologically active vaccine may produce a low measured VE under a range of epidemiological, vaccine-related and logistical conditions. Low case ascertainment may partly explain the observed heterogeneity in the performance of rotavirus vaccine across different settings, and should be considered in the design and interpretation of future field trials.

AB Introduction: Parental reporting of childhood vaccination status is often used for policy and program evaluation and research purposes. Many factors can bias parental reporting of childhood vaccination status, however, to our knowledge, no analysis has assessed whether time since vaccination impacts reporting accuracy. Therefore, using the Calgary electronic vaccine registry (PHANTIM) as the gold standard, we aimed to test the accuracy of parental reporting of childhood vaccination status at three different time-points since vaccination.
   Methods: The All Our Families (AOF) cohort study asked parents to report their child's 2, 4, 6, 12 and 18 month vaccines (vaccination time-point) on questionnaires given when the child was 1, 2 and 3 years of age (survey time-point). We linked the AOF parental reporting of vaccination status to the PHANTIM registry and calculated the percent agreement and difference in coverage estimates between PHANTIM and AOF at each vaccination and survey time-point combination. Furthermore, we measured the sensitivity and specificity, and negative (NPV) and positive predictive values (PPV) of parental vaccine recall across time.
   Results: AOF parent reports of coverage rates were consistently higher than the PHANTIM estimates. While we saw significant differences in percent agreement for certain vaccination time-points, we saw no consistent directional difference by survey time-point, suggesting that parental accuracy did not change with time. We found a uniformly high sensitivity across all vaccination and survey time-points, and no consistent patterns in the specificity, PPV and NPV results.
   Conclusion: Time since vaccination may not be the most important consideration when designing and implementing a vaccination survey. Other factors that may contribute to the bias associated with parental reporting of vaccination status include the complexity of the vaccine schedule, schedule changes over time, and the wording and structure of the questionnaires.

AB Background: The effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) against laboratory-confirmed influenza pneumonia in older adults remains to be established.
   Methods: Pneumonia patients aged >= 65 years who visited a study hospital in Chiba, Japan, were prospectively enrolled from February 2012 to January 2014. Sputum samples were collected from participants and tested for influenza virus by polymerase chain reaction assays. Influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against laboratory-confirmed influenza pneumonia was estimated by a test-negative design.
   Results: Among a total of 814 pneumonia patients, 42 (5.2%) tested positive for influenza: 40 were positive for influenza A virus, and two were positive for influenza B virus. The IVE against laboratory-confirmed influenza pneumonia was 58.3% (95% confidence interval, 28.8-75.6%). The IVE against influenza pneumonia hospital admission, severe pneumonia, and death was 60.2% (95% CI, 22.8-79.4%), 65.5% (95% CI, 44.3-78.7%), and 71% (95% CI, -62.9% to 94.8%), respectively. In the subgroup analyses, the WE against influenza pneumonia was higher for patients with immunosuppressive conditions (85.9%; 95% CI, 67.4-93.9%) than for those without (48.7%; 95% CI, 2.7-73%) but did not differ by patients' statin use status.
   Conclusion: IIV effectively reduces the risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza pneumonia in older adults. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Japan licensed the conjugate Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, Vaxemm (TM) Hib, based on clinical studies using subcutaneous injection. The present study was performed to ensure this vaccine is suitable for intramuscular injection in Japanese children.
   Methods: Thirty-one healthy 2-6-month-old infants received three doses of Vaxem (TM) Hib by intramuscular injection at 4-week intervals and a booster dose 1 year later, concomitant with routine infant (DTaP-IPV and pneumococcal) and toddler (measles-rubella) vaccines. Immunogenicity was assessed before and after the primary series and booster dose by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for anti-polyribo syl-ribitol-phosphate (PRP) antibodies. Safety was assessed by medical examination and diary cards completed by the subjects' parents/legal guardians.
   Results: There were no vaccine-related serious adverse events or withdrawals; all children completed the study. Four weeks after the primary series, the geometric mean anti-PRP titer (GMT) was 19.68 mu g/mL, and all children had seroprotective titers (>= 0.15 mu g/mL) that persisted until the booster dose. Proportions of titers indicative of long-term protection (>= 1.0 mu g/mL) were 100% after the primary series and 77.4% before the booster. Anamnestic responses to the booster had a GMT of 51.33 mu g/mL, and 100% had titers >= 1.0 mu g/mL. All but one subject reported injection site reactions as resolved within 3 days of vaccination; systemic reactions due to Hib and routine vaccines were also resolved within this period.
   Conclusions: Vaxem (TM) Hib was generally well tolerated and immunogenic in Japanese children when administered by intramuscular injection in a three-dose primary series and as a booster with concomitant routine vaccines. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB It is accepted that booster vaccinations of chickens with live Salmonella vaccines are essential part of vaccinations schemes to induce an effective adaptive immune response, As manufacturer of registered live Salmonella vaccines recommend different times of booster the question raises whether the duration between the first and second immunisation might influence the protective effect against Salmonella exposure. Chickens were immunised with a live Salmonella Enteritidis vaccine on day 1 of age followed by a booster vaccination at different intervals (day 28, 35 or 42 of age) to study the effects on the colonisation and invasion of the Salmonella vaccine strain, the humoral immune response and the efficacy against infection with Salmonella Enteritidis on day 56 of age, Immunisation of all groups resulted in a very effective adaptive immune response and a high degree of protection against severe Salmonella exposure, however, the time of booster had only an unverifiable influence on either the colonisation of the vaccine strain, the development of the humoral immune response or the colonisation of the Salmonella challenge strain. Therefore, the first oral immunisation of the chicks on day 1 of age seems to be of special importance and prerequisite for the development of the effective immune response. A booster immunisation should be carried out, however, the time of booster may vary between week 3 and week 7 of age of the chickens without adversely impact on the efficacy of the adaptive immune response or the protective effects.

AB Background: The consequences of the introduction of various pneumococcal protein conjugate vaccines (PCV) for children and adults is poorly understood.
   Objective: We undertook a population-based cohort study of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in Northern Alberta (Canada) from 2000 to 2014, years spanning pre-and early PCV (2000-2004) vs PCV-7 (2005-2009) vs PCV-13 (2010-2014) time periods.
   Design: We collected clinical, laboratory, and Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype information on all patients from 2000 to 2014. We determined changes in presentation, outcomes, serotypes, and incidence in children and adults across time periods.
   Setting: There were 509 cases of IPD in children, an 80% decrease over time. Rates of empyema (4.0-15.7%, p < 0.001), ICU admission (13.1-20%), and mortality (1.8-8.4%, p < 0.001) increased over time. There were 2417 cases of IPD in adults. Unlike children, incidence of IPD did not change nor did rates of empyema. ICU admissions increased (p = 0.004) and mortality decreased (18.7-16.5%, p = 0.002). The total number of serotypes causing IPD remained stable in children (22 vs 26 vs 20) while they decreased in adults (49 vs 47 vs 42).
   Conclusions and relevance: For children, PCV vaccination strategies resulted in decreased overall rates of IPD and we observed increased rates of empyema and mortality; for adults, there was no change in IPD rates although disease severity increased while mortality decreased. On a population-wide basis, our results suggest that current PCV vaccination strategies are associated with an overall decrease in IPD but disease severity seems to be increasing in both children and adults.

AB There is a need to develop protective vaccines against tuberculosis (TB). Recently, we identified an immunodominant T-cell antigen, Rv2645, from the region of deletion 13 (RD13) of M. tuberculosis (M. tb) H37Rv, which is absent in Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Here, a recombinant BCG expressing Rv2645, namely, BCG::Rv2645, was constructed. Compared to BCG, we found that BCG::Rv2645 improved the antigen presentation capacity of dendritic cells (DCs) and elicited much stronger Th1 and Th17 responses, higher CD44(high) CD62(low) effector memory CD4(+)T cells (T-EM), and fewer T regulated cells (Treg) and regulatory B10 in mice. Importantly, BCG::Rv2645 exhibited enhanced protective efficacy against virulent M. tb H37Rv challenge in both mice and rhesus monkeys, showing less severe pathology and reduced pathogens. Further, transcriptomic analysis and reverse transcription-quantitative real time PCR revealed that the mRNA levels of ISGylation (Isg)-related genes such as interferon-stimulated gene 15 (Isg15), and Th1- and Th17-related genes such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) were significantly up-regulated in splenocytes and macrophages after stimulation with Rv2645. This study shows that BCG::Rv2645 is a promising TB vaccine candidate with enhanced protective immunity. The enhanced Th1/Th17 immune responses and up-regulation of ISGylation-related genes induced by Rv2645 may be major factors contributing to the protective immunity of BCG::Rv2645.

AB Influenza vaccines are the most effective intervention to prevent the substantial public health burden of seasonal and pandemic influenza. The capability of hemagglutinin (HA), the main antigen in inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs), to elicit functional neutralizing antibodies determines IIV effectiveness. When HA is subjected to environmental stress during manufacturing or while stored prior to administration, such as low pH and temperature excursions, the HA immunological activity can be affected. Single-radial immunodiffusion (SRID), the standard in vitro potency assay for IIVs, is believed to specifically detect immunologically active HA and has been applied to evaluate HA stability against stress. Here we report that transient low pH treatment and freeze/thaw cycles with HA in PBS abolish SRID-quantified in vitro potency for all HAs of multiple influenza strains. Raised temperature substantially decreases in vitro potency with more extensive HA structural changes. Chemical stress and mechanical stress moderately change SRID in vitro potency values in a strain-dependent manner. Trypsin digestion, which selectively degrades stressed HA, followed by RP-HPLC quantification as a candidate alternative in vitro potency assay yields results comparable to SRID. Mouse immunogenicity studies confirm that HA stressed by transient low pH treatment does not elicit functional antibodies in vivo, nor does it have a measureable SRID value. However, HA stressed by raised temperature elicits high titers of functional antibodies in vivo despite substantial loss of SKID in vitro potency, This discrepancy between SRID in vitro potency and vaccine immunogenicity suggests that SRID may not reliably indicate IIV potency under all conditions. Further efforts to develop alternate potency assays that can better predict in vivo immunogenicity should continue along with additional studies exploring HA conformation, SRID values and consequent immunogenicity.

AB In this study, we assessed the protective efficacy of single subunit vaccines, encoded by the B. abortus 544 genes aspC, dps, yaeC and inpB, against B. abortus infection in mice. First, immunization with these antigens, with the exception of the YaeC protein, was found to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses with IgG2a being dominant over IgG1. In addition, a massive production of 1FN-gamma but lower degree of IL-10 was observed, suggesting that all three antigens were able to induce predominantly cell-mediated immunity in response to B. abortus infection. Further investigation of a combined subunit vaccine (CSV) consisting of purified AspC, Dps, InpB and Ndk proteins showed a superior protective effect in mice against brucellosis. The intraperitoneal injection of this combination was shown to induce a remarkable production of IFN-gamma and IL-2, which occurred in conjunction with an increase of blood CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell proportions. In addition, the higher titer of IgG2a compared to IgG1 elicited by this CSV was obtained, suggesting that this CSV induced a typical T-helper-1 -dominated immune response in vivo. Furthermore, the protection level induced by this combination was significantly higher than that induced by single antigens and was not significantly different compared to a group immunized with a live attenuated vaccine (RB51). Altogether, our findings suggest that the combination of different immunogenic antigens could be a useful approach for the development of a new, effective and safe brucellosis vaccine that can replace current vaccine strains.

AB Background: We report a phase III/IV open-label study on the immunogenicity of a single dose of a Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) (Fluenz (TM)) in children naive to, or in previous receipt of, ASO3(B) adjuvanted A/H1N1pdm09 influenza vaccine (Pandemrixlv (TM)), to investigate whether early exposure to an adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine impacts on subsequent response to quadrivalent LAIV (qLAIV).
   Method and findings: Eligible children were enrolled to receive qLAIV and stratified according to previous Pandemrix (TM) vaccination. Functional antibody for the vaccine strains were analysed using Haemagglutination Inhibition (HAI); in addition antibodies to the A/H1N1pdm09 strain were measured by Neuraminidase Antibody Inhibition (NAI) and neutralisation assays. Fourfold titre increases by HAI were observed for 39% (95% confidence interval 33-46%) and 43% (37-51%) of subjects for the two influenza B vaccine strains and 8% (5-13%) for the A/H3N2 strain with no significant differences between the Pandemrix (TM) naive or previously vaccinated groups in antibody tites pre- or post-vaccination or seroconversion rates. In both groups, the response to the qLAIV A/H1N1pdm09 component was barely detectable, overall HAI seroconversion rate 1.8% (0.5-4.7%). Previous receipt of Pandemrix (TM) was associated with significantly higher levels of A/H1N1pdm09 neutralising antibody, but decreased NAI titres pre-vaccination, with the differences maintained post-vaccination.
   Conclusion: Previous receipt of Pandemrix (TM) has had a significant impact on the influenza immune status of children several years later. Higher levels of neutralising antibody to A/H1N1pdm09 pre- and post-vaccination, but significantly lower levels of antibody to NA, were observed compared with Pandemrix (TM) naive children, while responses to influenza B and A/H3N2 and antibody levels prior to vaccination were similar in both groups. This suggests that early vaccination with a powerful adjuvant maintains functional immunity for several years, which prevents natural infection. Alternatively, the ASO3(B) adjuvant may have re-directed the immune response, with focus towards viral HA and away from viral NA. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: To estimate the costs of routine immunization (RI) services in China in 2015, to provide objective data relevant to investment in the Expanded Program on Immunization, and to contribute to global data on costing and financing of RI.
   Methods: The study was conducted between January and March 2016. We selected 276 villages, 138 townships, 46 counties, and 40 prefectures from 15 provinces as investigation sites at random, stratified by eastern, middle, and western regions. Direct cost items included vaccines, personnel, cold chain, surveillance, communication, training, and supervision at the national, provincial, prefecture, county, township, and village levels. We obtained financial data from governmental and external sources. Indirect costs of RI included parents' transportation costs and productivity lost due to taking their children for vaccination.
   Results: Total direct costs were $92.42 for each child fully immunized ($4,20/dose), which equates to $1529.55 million per birth cohort. RI costs were higher in the eastern region than in the western region, and higher than that of the central region. Vaccination coverage was positively associated with direct routine immunization costs. The cost of the recommended vaccines was $19.08/child and vaccine only accounted for 20.64% of total costs. Operational cost, including surveillance, communication, training and supervision, was $217.31 /child, accounting for 14.21% of total cost. The indirect cost per child was $72.86; the total indirect cost was $1205.83 million for the birth cohort. Government investment in RI accounted for about 70% of total costs. Revenue from sales of private-sector vaccine supported the remaining 30% of RI costs.
   Conclusions: While government financing has increased, some operating costs continue to be provided from revenue generated by sales of Category 2 (private-sector) vaccines to families.

AB Introduction: Severe and fatal pertussis infections are concentrated among infants who are too young to be protected through routine vaccinations. Maternal Tdap (mTdap), which is now the standard of care in the US and UK, is considered to be the most effective way to address this gap in preventative care. Little is known about how pregnant women in low-resource settings might view mTdap. To inform strategies for mTdap implementation in these contexts, public health researchers sought to understand knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs toward pertussis and maternal vaccines and assess the barriers to vaccine acceptance.
   Methods: We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) among mothers who participated in a longitudinal birth cohort study at the Chawama primary health center in Lusaka, Zambia, Since SAMIPS was not a clinical trial, but instead an observational cohort study, registration on clinical trials.gov was not required. Trained interviewers conducted the FGDs in January 2016 using a semi-structured interview guide, exploring participants' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs toward pertussis and vaccines. We analyzed the transcripts using Nvivo v.11 software.
   Results: Fifty mothers participated across 7 FGDs. Mothers had limited knowledge of pertussis and vaccines, yet expressed generally positive views of vaccinating themselves and their children. Participants conveyed very little vaccine hesitancy around maternal vaccinations, and discussed how they could protect their children's health. Mothers also highlighted barriers and facilitators to vaccine uptake, which included partner involvement, feelings of maternal authority over healthcare decision-making, and community rumors about Western medicine.
   Conclusion: Mothers viewed vaccinations as an important method to keep their children healthy, despite cultural myths and misconceptions about pertussis and vaccines. FGD results suggest that vaccine acceptability is high in Zambia, which is a critical factor to vaccine uptake, A strategy addressing myths and misconceptions should be prioritized if and when mTdap is introduced across low-resource settings.

AB The induction of an antibody response against self-antigens requires a conjugate vaccine technology, where the self-antigen is conjugated to a foreign protein sequence, and the co-application of a potent adjuvant. The choice of this foreign sequence is crucial as a very strong antibody response towards it may compromise the anti-self immune response. Here, we aimed to optimize the conjugate design for application of vaccination against the tumor vasculature, using two different approaches. First, the immunogenicity of the previously employed bacterial thioredoxin (TRX) was reduced by using a truncated from (TRXtr). Second, the Escherichia coli proteome was scrutinized to identify alternative proteins, based on immunogenicity and potency to increase solubility, suitable for use in a conjugate vaccine. This technology was used for vaccination against a marker of the tumor vasculature, the well-known extra domain B (EDB) of fibronectin. We demonstrate that engineering of the foreign sequence of a conjugate vaccine can significantly improve antibody production. The TRXtr construct outperformed the one containing full-length TRX, for the production of anti-self antibodies to EDB. In addition, efficient tumor growth inhibition was observed with the new TRXtr-EDB vaccine. Microvessel density was decreased and enhanced leukocyte infiltration was observed, indicative of an active immune response directed against the tumor vasculature.
   Summarizing, we have identified a truncated form of the foreign antigen TRX that can improve conjugate vaccine technology for induction of anti-self antibody titers. This technology was named Immuno-Boost (I-Boost). Our findings are important for the clinical development of cancer vaccines directed against self antigens, e.g. the ones selectively found in the tumor vasculature. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB The carbon emission reduction being achieved by Chinese coal combusted electricity generation are critical for global sustainable development and environmental protection. In this paper, to achieve carbon emission reduction and reliable electricity generation, an equilibrium strategy based on a hydro-wind-thermal complementary system under an uncertain environment that fully considers the cooperation of hydro power plants, wind power plants, and coal combusted thermal power plants is proposed as an optimization method. By considering the randomness of seasonal wind speeds, the water flow uncertainty and the fuzziness of coal thermal plant carbon emissions, the complementary model is more scientific and practical than current models. A case study from Bijie City is presented to demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of the optimization model. The results from 12 different wind speed and water flow level scenarios showed that the complementary system provides a superior method to solving the conflicts between carbon emission reduction and reliable electricity generation and therefore could be of great assistance to system operators when scheduling generation.

AB This paper presents performance prediction and optimization of an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) for diesel engine waste heat recovery based on artificial neural network (ANN). An ANN based prediction model of the ORC system is established with consideration of mean squared error and correlation coefficient. A test bench of combined diesel engine and ORC waste heat recovery system is developed, and the experimental data used to train and test the proposed ANN model are collected. A genetic algorithm (GA) is also considered in this study to increase prediction accuracy, and the ANN model is evaluated with different learning rates, train functions and parameter settings. A prediction accuracy comparison of the ANN model with and without using GA is presented. The effects of seven key operating parameters on the power output of the ORC system are investigated. Finally, a performance prediction and parametric optimization for the ORC system are conducted based on the proposed ANN model. The results show that prediction error of the ANN model with using the GA is lower than that without using GA. Therefore, it is recommended to optimize the weights of the ANN model with GA for a high prediction accuracy. The proposed ANN model shows a strong learning ability and good generalization performance. Compared to the experimental data, the maximum relative error is less than 5%. The experimental results after optimizing the operating parameters are very close to ANN's predictions, indicating one or more operating parameters can be adjusted to obtain a higher power output during the experiment process.

   of the power demand and energy storage
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT

   energy; Electricity demand and supply
ID SYSTEMS; EFFICIENCY
AB Because of their Global Climate Change contributions, it is desirable to reduce the amount of the global CO2 emissions. One of the ways to accomplish this is the substitution of coal with renewable energy sources, most notably wind and solar. However, the availability of wind energy and of insolation does not follow the diurnal and annual demand patterns of electric power. The large-scale substitution of coal with wind and solar significantly shifts the demand for the rest of the power producing units. When the contribution of wind and solar exceeds approximately 25% of the total annual energy produced, there are time periods within a year when excess electricity is produced that must be wasted/dissipated. This presents a severe constraint for the substitution of coal-generated electricity with renewables. At such production levels diurnal or seasonal storage of energy becomes necessary and hydrogen storage offers the best alternative. Based on the hourly, electricity demand of a region in North Texas, which has very high availability of wind and solar energy and is considered prime region for renewables, extensive calculations are made for: (a) the solar and wind rated power that are necessary for the substitution of part or all the power currently supplied by a coal-fired power plant; and (b) the storage requirements for this substitution. Significant seasonal and diurnal energy storage, on the order of 250,000 m(3), is required for the total substitution of coal in the region. The calculations also reveal that the substitution of coal with the renewable energy sources may be optimized for minimum energy storage capacity.

AB This research focused on the effect of calcium peroxide (CaO2) addition on anaerobic digestion (AD) of corn straw. It was found that the CaO2 dose of 0.032-0.256 g.g(-1) TVS (total VS of substrate and inoculum) had positive effect on the AD of corn straw by improving methane yield and content in biogas. Maximum methane yield was achieved at the CaO2 dose of 0.032 g.g(-1) TVS, which was 241.6 mL.g(-1) VSs (VS of substrate) and 11% higher than that of the control. Methane content in biogas also increased according to the in situ immobilization of CO2 by Ca(OH)(2) that produced via the reaction of CaO2 with water (XRD analysis results). Microbial community structure was significantly affected by CaO2 addition. The variation of bacterial community structure led to higher hydrolysis rate, and the variation of archaea community structure ensured the proceeding of methanogenesis process. The use of CaO2 could be a cost-effective method to improve methane production of corn straw because it avoids harsh condition and high cost (e.g., chemical and energy inputs) associated with conventional chemical treatment techniques. The digestate from the AD with the addition of CaO2 can contain high CaCO3 content, making it a potential soil amendment for acidic soil.

At this hybrid absorption/recompression system, a booster compressor has implemented between the generator and condenser of absorption system and by adjusting pressure ratio tried to reach to the absolute heat transfer between generator and condenser coils in order to improve the efficiency of system and avoid the heat dissipation in condenser. This system has some advantages such as being environmentally-friendly, removing the need for the bulky condenser, and having about four-fold more efficiency than conventional absorption system. The objective of current study is to accommodate a quantitative description of the hybrid system to reach the optimum matching temperature of the generator, condenser, and evaporator. Furthermore, irreversibility and exergy destruction for different components of the system have been calculated and demonstrated that maximum exergy destruction occurs at condenser and generator. It is concluded that in generator temperature of 60 degrees C for the hybrid system, coefficient of performance becomes maximum (4.4) and the total exergy destruction is minimum. Non-crystallization working range of the hybrid system occurs at low generator temperature in comparison with single-effect absorption system.

AB Performance and emissions experiments were conducted on a compression-ignition direct-injected natural gas engine (DING) equipped with a shielded glow plug ignition assist system. Tests were conducted at three different intake pressures (34.5 kPag, 68.9 kPag, 103.4 kPag), and four nominal (targeted) equivalence ratios (0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5). CH4, NOx, CO and PM emissions were measured and analyzed, showing that emissions levels are influenced by the DING engine's combustion modes and intake pressure. Premixed combustion which dominates at low equivalence ratios resulted in higher levels of CH4 and NOx emissions, while mixing-controlled combustion, which develops at higher equivalence ratios, resulted in elevated CO and PM levels. Higher intake pressure was found to improve all emissions levels. The most significant effect was the reduction of PM and CO emissions due to improved fuel charge mixing and air entrainment that results from a pressure-driven momentum increase of the engine's air swirl field. Brake specific emissions and fuel consumption were estimated and compared against levels reported in the literature for dual-fuel port-injection, and High-Pressure Direct Injection (HPDI) natural gas engines. The most significant finding was that the DING engine exhibits lower fuel consumption and PM emissions levels when compared to values reported in the literature for HPDI engines. The PM emissions advantage was attributed to a higher proportion of premixed combustion and the absence of a diesel pilot in DING engine operation. Lastly, PM size distributions were analyzed, showing that the DING engine produces PM that is smaller than PM of a conventional diesel engine, but similar to the PM reported in the literature for HPDI engines.

AB Organic-inorganic hybrid materials are promising for encapsulation of phase change materials (PCMs) to achieve exceptional capsule properties. In this work, novel polymer-SiO2 hybrid shelled nanoencapsulated PCMs (NanoPCMs) were fabricated in one-pot, through sequentially executed interfacial hydrolysis-polycondensation of alkoxy silanes and radical polymerization of vinyl monomers. The morphologies, chemical compositions, and crystal structures of the NanoPCMs were characterized by SEM, TEM, FT-IR, and XRD methods. The thermal energy storage capability, thermal reliability, and thermal conductivity were tested by DSC, accelerated thermal cycling test, and heat flux method, respectively. The leakage proof property and mechanical property were evaluated by seepage test and nanoindentation test, respectively. Compared with NanoPCMs with SiO2 shell, the NanoPCMs with polystyrene (PS)-SiO2 shell possess smaller size and bowl like shape, while NanoPCMs with poly (hydroxylethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA)-SiO2 shell possess larger size and perfect spherical shape. The polymer types have great impact on the supercooling behavior of the NanoPCMs. The polymer-SiO2 hybrid shell materials endow the NanoPCMs with improved thermal reliability, thermal conductivity, and leakage proof property. More importantly, the compressive load at yield increases remarkably from 14.7 mu N for nanocapsules with SiO2 shell, to > 34.6 mu N for that with PS-SiO2 shell, and 65 mu N for that with PHEMA-SiO2 shell.

AB The small-scale compressed air energy storage system (CAES) combined with renewable energy sources (RES) is becoming increasing popular in distributed energy system (DES), which allows RES uninterrupted and improves the supply capacity of power system. In order to balance the electricity load and improve the energy efficiency of CCHP system in combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system, the paper described a CCHP system combined with solar and compressed air energy storage (CCHP-S-CAES). Solar energy was coupled with the CAES in this paper to heat the high-pressure air from air storage cavern. The proposed system consists of a conventional CCHP, a CAES and a solar energy collector/storage system, which stores the surplus electric power of gas turbine during off-peak time and releases it during on-peak time. Sensitivity analysis on the CCHP-S-CAES system was conducted to investigate the effects of the key parameters on its performances. It is clear that the performances of the CCHP-S-CAES system are mainly determined by the pressure ratio of compressor, the inlet pressure and temperature of turbine and the effectiveness of heat exchangers. In addition, a multi-objective optimization based on the Non-dominated sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is performed for obtaining the optimum performance of the CCHP-S-CAES system from the view of investment cost and exergy efficiency. The results show that the optimal exergy efficiency of the proposed system is about 53.10% and 45.36% in maximum heating condition and maximum cooling condition respectively.

AB The knowledge of global solar radiation (H) is a prerequisite for the use of renewable solar energy, but H measurements are always not available due to high costs and technical complexities. The present study proposes two machine learning algorithms, i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a novel simple tree-based ensemble method named Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), for accurate prediction of daily H using limited meteorological data. Daily H, maximum and minimum air temperatures (T-max and T-min), transformed precipitation (P-t, 1 for rainfall > 0 and 0 for rainfall = 0) and extra-terrestrial solar radiation (H-0) during 1966-2000 and 2001-2015 from three radiation stations in humid subtropical China were used to train and test the models, respectively. Two combinations of input parameters, i.e. (i) only T-max, T-min and R-a, and (ii) complete data were considered for simulations. The proposed machine learning models were also compared with four well-known empirical models to evaluate their performances. The results suggest that the SVM and XGBoost models outperformed the selected empirical models. The performance of the machine learning models was improved by 5.9-12.2% for training phase and by 8.0-11.5% for testing phase in terms of RMSE when information of precipitation was further included. Compared with the SVM model, the XGBoost model generally showed better performance for training phase, and slightly weaker but comparable performance for testing phase in terms of accuracy. However, the XGBoost model was more stable with average increase of 6.3% in RMSE, compared to 10.5% for the SVM algorithm. Also, the XGBoost model (3.02 s and 0.05 s for training and testing phase, respectively) showed much higher computation speed than the SVM model (27.48 s and 4.13 s for training and testing phase, respectively). By jointly considering the prediction accuracy, model stability and computational efficiency, the XGBoost model is highly recommended to estimate daily H using commonly available temperature and precipitation data with excellent performance in humid subtropical climates.

AB CO-free hydrogen was successfully produced from the dehydrogenation of formic acid at a temperature near its boiling point of 110 degrees C by using a high-performance non-precious metal molybdenum based catalyst synthesized from soybean and earth-abundant molybdenum. The effect of carbonization temperature, raw material ratio on the catalytic activity for formic acid decomposition were investigated in details. The catalyst Soy-Mo (0.1) prepared at a carbonization temperature of 750 degrees C, the weight ratio of the soybean powder to Mo precursor of 1:0.1 showed the best catalytic activity among those as-synthesized catalysts. Even at a temperature as low as 110 degrees C, HCOOH conversion reached above 80% with a 100% H-2 selectivity and a long-term stability. It indicated that the catalysts derived from those biomass enriched in protein and alkaline metals have excellent performance for catalytic formic acid decomposition. This approach provided a new path for design and development of catalysts with high performance for CO-free hydrogen generation from formic acid in a large-scale industrial process.

AB Microalgae are a promising feedstock for biofuel generation. Economical and effective mass cultivation is essential for greater feasibility in microalgal-based biofuel full applications. The present study reported on cultivation of Chlorella sorokiniana CY-1 in palm oil mill effluent (POME) under photoautotrophic and mixotrophic cultivation. Enhancement of biomass and lipid productions were carried out by using glucose, urea and glycerol supplementations. Mixotrophic cultivation was more effective than photoautotrophic condition. Glycerol addition exhibited greater microalgae growth performance compared to supplementing glucose or urea. Biomass (1.68 g L-1) and lipid (15.07%) production were highest in POME medium with combinations of 200 mg L-1 urea, glucose and glycerol supplementation. Chlorella sorokiniana CY-1 grown in POME with glucose and glycerol supplementation gave considerably comparable yields as in all supplements-added POME medium. Ideal fatty acids compositions shown in urea and glycerol supplemented-POME medium though lower biomass production obtained. The pollutant remediation efficiencies attained were 6185% COD, 91.54% TN and 83.25% TP in all supplements-added medium. The estimated net energy ratio was 0.55 and nutrient cost could be reduced up to 76%. Cheap and effective carbon and nutrients supplementation is essential to minimize the economic impact and maximize yields in commercial scale microalgae cultivation for biofuel production and environmental sustainability.

AB Growing concerns about anthropogenic climate change and its effects on the environment have encouraged significant recent developments towards decarbonizing the energy system. Developments in transportation technology, such as vehicle electrification, can result in significant CO2, particulate matter, and SOx reductions over the lifetime of a vehicle. The shipping industry alone accounted for 2.1% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2012, however, due to energy requirements and weight restrictions, batteries and direct electrification cannot be used to mitigate emissions. Synthetic fuels, as an indirect electrification option, are a viable solution to achieve emission reduction goals. The purpose of this study is to determine the most cost effective combination of synthetic fuels and fuel cells or internal combustion engines to replace fossil oil as the main propulsion fuel in the shipping industry in 2030 and 2040. The fuels, namely RE-FT-Diesel, RE-LNG, RE-LH2 and RE-MeOH, are analysed for both an internal combustion engine and a fuel cell. The scenarios were analysed by comparing the levelised cost of mobility (LCOM). The LCOM was composed of 5 different facets including the capex of the engines/fuel cells and the tanks, the opex of the engines/fuel cells, the cost of lost cargo space, fuel cost and the CO2 cost. The final unit of comparison was epsilon/1000DWT-km. It was determined that hydrogen fuel cells were the most likely to replace fossil internal combustion engines if the fuel cells follow their expected development. Significant gains in fuel cell average efficiency and decreases in production cost between today and 2030 and 2040 are factors contributing to the competitiveness. A CO2 cost was set to 61 E/tCO(2) in 2030 and 75 epsilon/CO2 in 2040. Most of the other technology combinations are close to competing with fossil diesel with a CO2 price in 2040; however, hydrogen fuel cells are close to competing with fossil fuel without a CO2 cost in 2040.

AB Fermentative hydrogen produced from activated sludge has received much attention among the scientific community. In the present study, optimized multi hydrolytic garbage enzyme complex (OGEC) produced from pre-consumer organic waste was used to hydrolysis dairy waste activated sludge (DWAS). Statistical optimization tools were used to determine the optimal environmental conditions for OGEC-DWAS pre-treatment and the models were evaluated. The result showed the maximum suspended solid reduction and solubilized chemical oxygen demand of 25.77% and 28.68% respectively were obtained at optimum conditions viz pH 6, temperature 40 degrees C, agitation speed 210 RPM and duration of pre-treatment 30 h. Further, to improve the solubilization of OGEC-DWAS, the effect of ultrasound on OGEC pre-treated sludge was investigated and results showed that 25 min of sonication time with power density of 0.6 W/ml improves the solubilization of OGEC-DWAS. Simultaneously cumulative biohydrogen production using pretreated DWAS through batch anaerobic digestion was studied and concluded that the maximum biohydrogen can be produced from combined OGEC-Ultrasound pretreated DWAS compared with raw sludge. This study helps to achieve an eco-friendly sustainable methodology to utilize WAS for biohydrogen production.

AB Phase change materials (PCMs)have been widely applied for thermal energy storage and thermoregulation. This paper reported a smart design and construction of nanoflake-like MnO2/SiO2 hierarchical microcapsules containing n-docosane PCM for in-situ thermal management of supercapacitors. The microcapsules based on an n-docosane core and SiO2 shell were first synthesized through interfacial polycondensation, and then a mesoporous nanoflake-like MnO2 layer was fabricated onto the surface of SiO2 shell through template-directed self assembly. The chemical compositions of the resultant microcapsules were confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray, X-ray photoelectron and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and their nanoflake-like hierarchical morphology and well-defined core-shell structure were identified by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The mesoporous architecture of nanoflake-like MnO2 outer layer was determined by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm. The obtained microcapsules exhibited high phase-change enthalpies, high encapsulation efficiency, good phase-change and anti-osmosis performance and an effective thermoregulation capability. Most of all, these microcapsules demonstrated a higher specific capacitance than traditional MnO2/ SiO2 solid particles at operation temperatures higher than 45 degrees C due to in-situ thermal management by the n-docosane core. They not only achieved a high specific capacitance of 312.2F/g at 45 degrees C with a current density of 1.0 A/g due to the mesoporous architecture of MnO2 layer, but also presented a superior long-term cycling stability with high capacitance retention of 94.7% after 1000 charging/discharging cycles. With the above mentioned superiorities, the microcapsules developed by this work will be a good candidate as an electrode material for supercapacitors. This study opens a new pathway for the development and applications of micro encapsulated PCMs in the thermoregulatory electrode system of supercapacitors and Li-ions battery cells.

AB Soot is an undesired co-product during thermal-chemical disposal (incineration, pyrolysis, etc.) of plastic wastes at high temperatures, while also regarded as a valuable nanoscale carbon-based material if with proper production and post-treatment methods. In this paper, the pyrolysis of polyurethane (PU) plastics, a major composition of plastic waste, was conducted in a fixed-bed reactor to investigate the soot formation mechanism in depth. The effects of pyrolysis temperature (1000-1300 degrees C) and volatile residence time (0.2-2 s) on the yield, micro-morphology, composition and reactivity of soot were studied. Results show that the initialization and growth of soot particles during PU pyrolysis requires a certain high temperature and long volatile residence time. With a volatile residence time of 2 s, the soot yield is 11.0 wt.% at 1000 degrees C and increases to 24.5 wt.% with the pyrolysis temperature increasing to 1300 degrees C; while when the volatile residence time decreases to 0.2 s, the soot cannot be observed until 1200 degrees C. When the pyrolysis temperature increases 1000-1100 degrees C, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicates an enhanced graphitization thereby a lower reactivity of soot oxidation, which is approved by onion-like layered structures initially observed by the high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) at 1100 degrees C and 2 s. When the pyrolysis temperature increases from 1100 degrees C to 1200-1300 degrees C, NaCI is observed in soot particles, which catalysis promotes the reactivity of soot oxidation. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used to measure the gas and tar compositions, especially the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are proved essential for the formation of soot precursor. A large number of PAHs with ring number 4 start to form at 1100-1200 degrees C. Based on the soot characterization and gas-tar compositions, a pathway from light fragments and mono-ring aromatics to heavier aromatic compounds is proposed aiming to explain the chemical evolution of soot precursor particles.

AB Owing to the increasingly serious social energy crisis nowadays, wind power and other renewable energy are paid more attention. However, penetration of wind power prominently enhances the degree of complexity and difficulty in planning and dispatching of electric power systems. High-precision and more-information short term wind power forecasting (STWPF) results can effectively alleviate the uncertainly of wind power and balance the electrical power. Kernel function and bandwidth selection method have significant impact on the results of STWPF. A hybrid wind power probability density prediction method based on quantile regression neural network and Epanechnikov kernel function using Unbiased cross-validation (QRNNE-UCV) is presented. The wind power predicting results at different conditional quantiles are used as the input of kernel density estimation (KDE), which is capable of estimating the comprehensive wind power probability density forecasting information at any time in the future. In order to evaluate the wind power prediction results, the paper constructs two evaluation criteria, including evaluation metrics of point prediction results and evaluation metrics of prediction interval (PI). As a point prediction result, the probability mean is first constructed in the paper. Two real datasets of wind power from Ontario, Canada, are used to verify the QRNNE-UCV method. Moreover, by comparing with the probability density results at various confidence levels, the influence of confidence level on STWPF is investigated in this article. Experiment results show that the QRNNE-UCV method can construct more accurate PI and probability density curves, and the calculated probability mean is superior to the other point predictions. Meanwhile, the quality of PICP and PINAW improves with the increase of confidence level. The above prediction results have the ability to validly quantify the indeterminacy of wind power generation in contrast to existing support vector quantile regression (SVQR) and quantile regression neural network and triangle kernel function (QRNNT) probability density forecasting methods.

AB In this work, the co-pyrolysis and co-gasification of Nannochioropsis sp. microalgae (NM) and Colombian bituminous coal (CC) were performed in order to evaluate potential synergistic effects and the kinetic parameters, which are essential for advancing the co-utilization. The effect of the share of feedstock, microalgae and coal, on the co-pyrolysis and co-gasification behavior was studied under different heating rates and temperatures. There were synergistic effects between the two fuels during their co-pyrolysis process, especially for that mixture containing 50 wt% of microalgae. At conversion levels < 25 wt%, the activation energy (E-a) was found to be lower than the individual microalgae, 143 and 170 kJ/mol, respectively. Despite the acid leaching pre-treatment (NM-ac) showed a positive effect on the microalgae pyrolysis kinetics for conversion values < 60 wt%, the trend was inverted at higher conversions, due to the removal of alkali species form microalgae ash, which also slowed the CC/NM gasification. However, ash removal can potentially reduce operational issues related to presence of Cl and Na. Both synergistic and inhibiting effects were observed in the co-gasification experiments. Synergistic effect at temperatures higher than 800 degrees C was due to the microalgae high Na content that promoted coal char gasification, resulting in an E-a, decrease for the coal from 189.9 to 146.1 kJ/mol. This reduction was higher to that expected if both fuels would behave according to the mixtures additive law (159.1 kJ/mol), Inhibiting effect at 750-800 degrees C can be linked to lower presence of Na on char surface and lower transformation of NaCl in gasification active species.

AB How to effectively reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gases emission to alleviate global warming has been a public concern since 20th century. Hence, development of effective CO2 and CH4 reduction technique is a common objective worldwide. Simultaneous conversion of CO2 and CH4 into syngas can be a candidate to achieve the objective. Among several conversion techniques, plasma and photocatalysis are two promising techniques possessing good potentials. In this work, a spark discharge reactor and a series of perovskite-type photocatalysts are developed and combined to form hybrid plasma photocatalysis systems to evaluate the effectiveness for converting CO2 and CH4 to form syngas. Experimental results indicate that the spark discharge reactor packed with LF0600 photocatalyst increases the syngas generation rate from 13.0 to 18.5 mol per kilowatt-hour, corresponding to 42% of enhancement. Furthermore, characterizations of photocatalysts reveal that plasma can promote the surface structure of photocatalyst to increase the lifetime of electron-hole pairs which possibly leads to higher syngas generation rate. Additionally, the hybrid plasma photocatalysis system developed has been demonstrated with good potential to improve plasma and photocatalysis performances.

AB This study emphasizes the control of benzene derivatives and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in thermolysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) using CO2. To this end, the generation of benzenes and PAHs from the thermolysis of PVC in N-2 was characterized and all experimental findings from the thermolysis of PVC in N-2 were used as the reference value to configure the role of CO2 in the thermolysis of PVC. The formation of hydrogen chloride (HCl) followed by the subsequent dechlorination in the thermolysis of PVC in N-2 resulted in the high yield of charring compounds, providing a favorable condition for forming benzene derivatives and PAHs. However, the thermal degradation of PVC in CO2 showed the genuine thermal degradation patterns. For instance, despite the presence of the source for oxygen, the formation of CO at temperatures higher than 600 degrees C was observed in the thermolysis of PVC in CO2, suggesting that some unknown reactions between hydrocarbons from the thermolysis of PVC and CO2 are initiated to form CO. In addition to these unknown reactions, the enhanced thermal cracking induced by CO2 was observed. Two identified roles of CO2 during the thermolysis of CO2 was only limited at temperatures higher than 600 degrees C. However, despite no precise description for the mechanistic role of CO2 at this stage of study, the formation of benzene derivatives and PAHs was effectively controlled in the presence of CO2 at temperatures higher than 480 degrees C. Thus, these empirical findings in this study are necessary to further be investigated in the future, which offers a great venue offering a new means for modifying and/or controlling the harmful chemical species.

AB Single-stage cultivation strategy is more favorable than two-stage cultivation owing to the lesser technical obstacles and being more cost-effective in the microalgal biodiesel production. Hence, in this study, mixotrophically grown Chlorella minutissima MCC 27 biomass was optimized for synergistic maximization of biomass yield and intracellular lipid accumulation using Central Composite Rotatable Design (CCRD). The effect of mix carbon sources (glucose + acetate), nitrate concentration and culture time on biomass accumulation and lipid content (% DCW) was evaluated separately using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Out of the three strategies, viz., biomass optimization (BO), lipid content (% DCW), and simultaneous production of biomass and lipid content and their maximization, the third strategy was found to be most effective to obtain the maximum lipid productivity (108.81 mg L-1 d(-1)), which was approximately 10-fold higher than the autotrophically grown C. minutissima culture. The optimized conditions for maximum lipid productivity were found to be 5.96 g L-1 glucose, 4.12 g L-1 acetate, 0.73 g L-1 nitrate and incubation period of 10 days. Palmitic acid was the principal FAME composite followed by oleic acid and the ratio of saturated fatty acids (SFA):monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was found to be 1.9:1.8:1. Accordingly, simultaneous biomass and lipid content optimization was found to be a better strategy for the maximization of lipid yield as compared to the other strategies followed in the present study.

AB Accurate and reliable solar radiation models are important in the building energy conservation, solar thermal and photovoltaic utilization, agricultural production and ecological environment, in which the global solar radiation model based on sunshine percentage is the most common model. Sunshine duration only reflects the time accumulation of solar radiation, but cannot reflect its intensity accumulation. Therefore, it is difficult to improve the accuracy of such models. To solve this problem, a new quality of sunshine duration model (QSD model) is proposed, which takes into account both the influence of sunshine duration on solar radiation and the effect of solar radiation intensity on the accumulation of day. The QSD model is simplified from the energy balance equation which is established based on theoretical analysis of the heat transfer process among the Earths surface layer, air layer and atmospheric layer. Then Meteorological data of 24 stations are utilized to analyze the accuracy of QSD model. The results show that the QSD model is more accurate, and the accuracy of QSD model is best during sunny days, followed by cloudy days, whereas overcast days provide the worst results. Meanwhile, a QSD model is obtained based on data from different regions. Statistical analysis shows that a QSD model has universal applicability in China, and the average value of correlation coefficient (R) is 0.929, Nash-Sutcliffe equation (NSE) is 0.864, and root mean squared error (RMSE) is 0.088.

AB This study is a numerical investigation of a heat exchanger under external flow. Temperature variable properties are used to solve the governing equations. Air is selected as an external fluid and water and MgO-MWCNTs/EG hybrid nanofluid are selected as radiator fluid. In this paper, the efficiency of the horizontal and vertical radiator are studied using experimental data for thermo-physical properties of MgO-MWCNTs/EG Nanofluid. Then, tubes with circular and elliptic sections are investigated for different flows, inlet temperatures and concentrations. The pressure drop and Nusselt number for each simulation are analyzed. Results are presented in terms of temperature distribution, pressure drop, Nusselt number and their sensitivity analysis for different states. The results indicate that radiators with vertical tubes have better efficiency up to 10% than radiators with horizontal tubes. In addition, heat exchangers with circular pipes have 25% lower pressure drop and those with elliptical tubes had 10% higher Nusselt number. The finding shows that an increase in the Nano-fluid concentration improves the Nusselt number and increases the pressure drop.

AB With the increasing global production of plastics, co-pyrolyzing biomass and waste plastics has emerged as a promising way to improve the quality of pyrolysis products. In the present study, the possibility of enhancing the synergistic interactions between biomass and plastics was explored by co-pyrolyzing acid pretreated corn stover (CS) and polyethylene (PE) in the presence or absence of zeolite catalyst. During non-catalytic co-pyrolysis, the use of acid-pretreated CS was found to synergistically reduce char yield and increase both the yield and quality of CS-derived pyrolysis oil. When acid-pretreated CS was catalytically co-pyrolyzed with PE, the yields of aromatic hydrocarbons and alkene increased whereas the yields of solid residue and carbon oxides decreased to a much greater extent than co-pyrolyzing raw CS and PE. The synergistic effect was least significant with raw CS and PE, suggesting the presence of alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) in the biomass hinder the occurrence of synergy. The positive synergy was strongest with acid-infused CS and PE. When acid-infused CS was co-pyrolyzed with PE, not only did the yield of phenolic monomers increase, but levoglucosan yield also increased significantly. During catalytic co-pyrolysis, acid-infused CS and PE also produced the highest yield of aromatic hydrocarbon and lowest yield of solid residue. This study also showed that co-pyrolysis with PE mitigates char agglomeration associated with pyrolyzing CS alone.

AB In this study, an enhanced non-isothermal, two-phase 1D analytical proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) model is developed, which not only considers the water saturation jump, but also proposes a novel method to analytically solve the water phase changes and couple the liquid and vapor transport together. A stringent model validation procedure is used to show good agreement between the simulated results and the experimental data, taking advantage of the "three-step" and "multi-case" validation methods. It is revealed that the uncertain parameters may deteriorate model reliability and credibility, thus demonstrating the necessity to conduct sensitivity analysis. A multi-parametric screening method i.e. the elementary effect (EE) method based on Monte Carlo experiments is implemented to comprehensively analyze the total 22 uncertain parameters (including geometric, physical and electrochemical parameters), which are finally classified into very sensitive ones, rather sensitive ones and insensitive ones. The cathodic parameters are found more sensitive than the anodic ones, and the parameters of different components may have distinct sensitivity. Besides, whether the effect of each parameter is positive or negative on cell performance is also discussed. Furthermore, three cases with different groups of parameters are presented, which show almost the same polarization curve, and the two sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test is applied to verify the stability difference. It is concluded that those uncertain parameters not only influence the cell performance but also affect the model stability, and hence the effects of varying operating conditions should be taken into account in validation work.

AB The present experimental research work is focused on enhancing the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of a novel tamarind seed methyl ester using nanopartcles. Initially, the tamarind seed methyl ester is blended with diesel at 10%, 20% and 30% concentrations by volume and all the fuel samples have been tested in diesel engine for the selection of an optimum blend for nanoparticle addition. Then two nano additives namely alumina oxide and multi-walled carbon nano tubes are doped with an optimum tamarind seed methyl ester blend at concentrations of 30 ppm and 60 ppm for a comparative analysis. The study revealed that the addition of 60 ppm of alumina oxide with tamarind seed methyl ester blend has shown 1.6% higher brake thermal efficiency than that of tamarind seed methyl ester blend. The reformulation of tamarind seed methyl ester blend by nanoparticle addition has shown 15-51% and 24-68% reduction in carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon emissions respectively. Further, oxides of nitrogen emission are reduced by 7-9% during nanoparticle addition with tamarind seed methyl ester blend. On the other hand, the nanoparticle addition with tamarind seed methyl ester blend is produced better combustion characteristics compared to tamarind seed methyl ester-diesel blend. Therefore, the present study showed that the diesel engine characteristics for tamarind seed methyl ester blend operation could be improved with dispersion of nanoparticle.

AB In multi-product multi-vehicle production routing problems (MMPRPs), it is necessary to accurately model the capacity utilization of multiple products to obtain feasible production plans. Thus, start-up variables are required to model the capacity consumed or cost incurred when a machine starts a production batch, or when a machine switches from one product to another. In this work, we present a mixed integer linear programming model of the MMPRP with the startup cost (MMPRPSC), which is an extension of the single-item multi-vehicle production routing problem. It also generalizes the multi-item multi-vehicle inventory routing problems by incorporating production decisions. This formulation is tightened with three families of valid inequalities in which the generalized (1, S) inequalities are used in these problem settings for the first time. Using the formulation and valid inequalities, we implement a branch and -cut algorithm for the solution of the MMPRPSC. Computational experiments also confirm the effectiveness of the valid inequalities. The computational results of a case study show a 15% percent decrease in the total cost. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Operational risk refers to deficiencies in processes, systems, people or external events, which may generate losses for an organization. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has defined different possibilities for the measurement of operational risk, although financial institutions are allowed to develop their own models to quantify operational risk. The advanced measurement approach, which is a risk sensitive method for measuring operational risk, is the financial institutions preferred approach, among the available ones, in the expectation of having to hold less regulatory capital for covering operational risk with this approach than with alternative approaches. The advanced measurement approach includes the loss distribution approach as one way to assess operational risk. The loss distribution approach models loss distributions for business-line-risk combinations, with the regulatory capital being calculated as the 99,9% operational value at risk, a percentile of the distribution for the next year annual loss. One of the most important issues when estimating operational value at risk is related to the structure (type of distribution) and shape (long tail) of the loss distribution. The estimation of the loss distribution, in many cases, does not allow to integrate risk management and the evolution of risk; consequently, the assessment of the effects of risk impact management on loss distribution can take a long time. For this reason, this paper proposes a flexible integrated inverse adaptive fuzzy inference model, which is characterized by a Monte-Carlo behavior, that integrates the estimation of loss distribution and different risk profiles. This new model allows to see how the management of risk of an organization can evolve over time and it effects on the loss distribution used to estimate the operational value at risk. The experimental study results, reported in this paper, show the flexibility of the model in identifying (1) the structure and shape of the fuzzy input sets that represent the frequency and severity of risk; and (2) the risk profile of an organization. Therefore, the proposed model allows organizations or financial entities to assess the evolution of their risk impact management and its effect on loss distribution and operational value at risk in real time.

AB Classification is an important task in various areas. In many real-world applications, class imbalance and overlapping problems have been reported as major issues in the application of traditional classification algorithms. An imbalance problem occurs when training data contain considerably more representatives of one class than of other classes. Class overlap occurs when a region in the data space contains a similar number of data for each class. When a class overlap occurs in imbalanced data sets, classification becomes even more complicated. Although various approaches have been proposed to deal separately with class imbalance and overlapping problems, only a few studies have attempted to address both problems simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an overlap-sensitive margin (OSM) classifier based on a modified fuzzy support vector machine and k-nearest neighbor algorithm to address imbalanced and overlapping data sets. The main idea of the proposed OSM classifier is to separate the data space into soft- and hard-overlap regions using the modified fuzzy support vector machine algorithm. The separated spaces are then classified using the decision boundaries of the support vector machine and 1-nearest neighbor algorithms. Furthermore, by separating a data set into soft- and hard-overlap regions, one can determine which part of the data is to be examined more closely for classification in real-world situations. Experiments using synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrated that the proposed OSM classifier outperformed existing methods for imbalanced and overlapping situations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the past few decades, credit scoring has become an increasing concern for financial institutions and is currently a popular topic of research. This study aims to generate a novel ensemble model for credit scoring, to obtain superior performance and high robustness, adapting to different imbalance ratio datasets. First, according to the credit scoring data characteristics, the proposed model extends the BalanceCascade approach to generate adjustable balanced subsets based on the imbalance ratios of training data. Further, it reduces the negative effect of imbalanced data and improves the comprehensive performance of the predictive model. Second, the proposed model adopts two kinds of tree-based classifiers, random forest and extreme gradient boosting, as the base classifiers for a three-stage ensemble model. This includes the use of stacking to generate predicted results of the former layer as new explanatory features in the latter layer, and the use of a particle swarm optimization algorithm for parameters optimization of the base classifiers. Finally, the results indicate that the average performance of the proposed model is superior to other comparative algorithms as reflected in most evaluation measures for different datasets. It demonstrates that the proposed model is robust and represents a positive development in credit scoring. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hesitant fuzzy preference relation (HFPR) is an effective tool to elicit decision makers' hesitant preference information over alternatives, and consistency analysis is of great importance for an HFPR since inconsistent judgments may result in unreasonable results. In this paper, the best additive consistency index, the worst additive consistency index and the average additive consistency index are defined to measure the consistency level of an HFPR. To improve the additive consistency of an HFPR, some mixed 0-1 linear programming models which aim to minimize the overall adjustment amount and the number of the elements that need to be adjusted are established. Moreover, the proposed models are extended to improve the additive consistency and impute the missing elements for incomplete HFPRs. Some numerical examples are presented to show the characteristics of the proposed models. The results demonstrate that the proposed models can improve the consistency of an HFPR effectively.

AB The primary task of a memory-based collaborative filtering (CF) recommendation system is to select a group of nearest (similar) user neighbors for an active user. Traditional memory-based CF schemes tend to only focus on improving as much as possible the accuracy by recommending familiar items (i.e., popular items over the group). Yet, this may reduce the number of items that could be recommended and consequently weakens the chances of recommending novel items. To address this problem, it is desirable to consider recommendation coverage when selecting the appropriate group. This could help in simultaneously making both accurate and diverse recommendations. In this paper, we propose to focus mainly on the growing of the large search space of users' profiles and to use an evolutionary multi-objective optimization-based recommendation system to pull up a group of profiles that maximizes both similarity with the active user and diversity between its members. In such manner, the recommendation system will provide high performances in terms of both accuracy and diversity. The experimental results on the Movielens benchmark and on a real-world insurance dataset show the efficiency of our approach in terms of accuracy and diversity compared to state-of-the-art competitors.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Runtime uncertainty such as unpredictable resource unavailability, changing environmental conditions and user needs, as well as system intrusions or faults represents one of the main current challenges of self-adaptive systems. Moreover, today's systems are increasingly more complex, distributed, decentralized, etc. and therefore have to reason about and cope with more and more unpredictable events. Approaches to deal with such changing requirements in complex today's systems are still missing. This work presents SACRE (Smart Adaptation through Contextual REquirements), our approach leveraging an adaptation feedback loop to detect self-adaptive systems' contextual requirements affected by uncertainty and to integrate machine learning techniques to determine the best operationalization of context based on sensed data at runtime. SACRE is a step forward of our former approach ACon which focus had been on adapting the context in contextual requirements, as well as their basic implementation. SACRE primarily focuses on architectural decisions, addressing self-adaptive systems' engineering challenges. Furthering the work on ACon, in this paper, we perform an evaluation of the entire approach in different uncertainty scenarios in real-time in the extremely demanding domain of smart vehicles. The real-time evaluation is conducted in a simulated environment in which the smart vehicle is implemented through software components. The evaluation results provide empirical evidence about the applicability of SACRE in real and complex software system domains. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper considers the non-smooth arc routing problem (NS-ARP) with soft constraints in order to capture in more perceptive way realistic constraints violations arising in transportation and logistics. To appropriately solve this problem, a biased-randomized procedure with iterated local search (BRILS) and a mathematical model for this ARP variant is proposed. An extensive computational study is conducted on rich and diverse problem instances. The results highlight the competitiveness of BRILS in terms of quality and time, where it provides high-quality solutions within reasonable computational times. In the context of real-world environments, the performance exhibited by BRILS motivates its incorporation in intelligent and integrative systems where frequent and fast solutions are required.

Existing research has neglected the differences in resource allocation types, by and large employed statistical analysis methods, and identified only the linear relationships among experimental variances of cross-sectional data. The present study differs from existing research in the following ways: First, we thoroughly consider the multi-faceted nature of resource allocation. Second, we use the method of multi-agent imitation according to perspective of dynamic system evolution and the principle of phase theory, allowing the explicitly analysis of nonlinear functional logic, forms and patterns in the variance. Finally, we analyze the appropriateness of different resource allocation models. Our paper features several significant findings: (1) The evolution of the knowledge flow network of a strategic alliance can produce a bifurcation phenomenon composed of saddle-node bifurcation and transcritical bifurcation. (2) The number of nodes exhibits a logarithmic growth distribution, the connection intensity and the network gain exhibit exponential growth distributions, and the connectivity and knowledge flow frequency are mutually influential in the form of a power function. (3) Knowledge-embedded resource allocation is most effective for improving the knowledge flow rate of networks and can further supply ample impetus for evolution. (4) Cooperation-oriented resource allocation is most beneficial for quickly propelling the network into the evolution realm. (5) Relationship-oriented resource allocation can aid the network in capturing more profit. Furthermore, this research is beneficial for understanding the key problems of each resource allocation model and the evolution of strategic alliance in knowledge flow networks. Our proposed methods and framework can be more widely applied to the fields of complex networks, knowledge management, and strategic innovation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Goldenberry waste powder, contained 5.87% moisture, 15.89% protein, 13.72% fat, 3.52% ash, 16.74% dietary fiber and 61% carbohydrates. Potassium (560 mg/100 g) was the predominant element followed by sodium (170 mg/100 g) and phosphorus (130 mg/100 g). Amino acid analysis gave high levels of cystine/methionine, histidine and tyrosine/phenylalanine. Goldenberry waste powder had good levels of the techno-functional properties including water absorption index, swelling index, foaming capacity and stability (3.38 g/g, 5.24 ml/g, 4.09 and 72.0%, respectively). Fatty acids profile showed that linoleic acid was the predominant fatty acid followed by oleic, palmitic and stearic acids. Iodine value (109.5 g/100 g of oil), acid value (2.36 mg KOH/g of oil), saponification value (183.8 mg KOH/g of oil), peroxide value (8.2 meq/kg of oil) and refractive index (1.4735) were comparable to those of soybean and sunflower oils. Goldenberry waste oil exhibited absorbance in the UV range at 100-400 nm.

AB A new equation for converting EC50 into TEAC values and TEAC into EC50 is presented in this paper. The model was fitted to 180 data points of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy measurements of various food products. The model was tested basing on 75 EPR spectroscopy measurements. Moreover, the equation was tested on literature data. The determination coefficient between EC50cal and EC50exp was found to be R-2 = 0.9762, while the determination coefficient between TEAC(cal) and TEAC(exp) was found to be R-2 = 0.9686. Based on obtained results it can be concluded that the proposed model for converting EC50 into TEAC values and TEAC into EC50 values works properly. This will enable a comparison of the antioxidant properties of products identified in literature through the use of different parameters (TEAC, EC50).

AB High-field and low-field proton NMR spectroscopy were used to analyse lipophilic extracts from ground roast coffees. Using a sample preparation method that produced concentrated extracts, a small marker peak at 3.16 ppm was observed in 30 Arabica coffees of assured origin. This signal has previously been believed absent from Arabicas, and has been used as a marker for detecting adulteration with robusta. Via 2D 600 MHz NMR and LC-MS, 16-O-methylcafestol and 16-O-methylkahweol were detected for the first time in Arabica roast coffee and shown to be responsible for the marker peak. Using low-field NMR, robusta in Arabica could be detected at levels of the order of 1-2% w/w. A surveillance study of retail purchased "100% Arabica" coffees found that 6 out of 60 samples displayed the 3.16 ppm marker signal to a degree commensurate with adulteration at levels of 3-30% w/w.

AB Citral-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (citral-SLNs) were prepared via a high-pressure homogenization method, using glyceryl monostearate (GMS) as the solid lipid and a mixture of Tween 80 (T-80) and Span 80 (S-80) at a weight ratio of 1: 1 as the surfactant. The microstructure and properties of the citral-SLNs were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The chemical stability of citral in the citral-SLNs was analyzed by solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography (SPME-GC). The GC results showed that 67.0% of the citral remained in the citral-SLN suspensions after 12 days, while only 8.22% remained in the control. Therefore, the encapsulation of citral in the solid lipid can enhance its stability in acidic surroundings.

AB Aflatoxins are the most potent genotoxic and carcinogenic mycotoxins. To date, research has only focused on the presence of free aflatoxins in agricultural commodities. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of possible modified aflatoxins in maize. Different hydrolysis methods were applied to convert modified mycotoxins into their free aflatoxins. Eighteen aflatoxin-contaminated maize samples were incubated with potassium hydroxide, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and several enzymes to induce hydrolysis. Potassium hydroxide caused a total reduction of aflatoxins, while trifluoromethanesulfonic acid did not lead to an increase in free aflatoxins, neither did treatment with a protease. However, a-amylase and cellulase incubation caused significant increases in the total free aflatoxin content, 15 +/- 8% and 13 +/- 5%, respectively. These results show that a small proportion of aflatoxins could be associated to matrix substances in plants. Consequently, hydrolysis could occur during food processing and during mammalian digestion, leading to an underestimation of the total aflatoxin content.

AB In this study, the processing derived contaminants 2- and 3-monochloropropanediol (2- and 3-MCPD) esters and glycidyl esters (GEs) were analysed in 84 oil samples by GC-MS/MS for the discrimination of processing grades of olive oils as a potential authentication tool. Concentrations of 2- and 3-MCPD esters and GEs varied in the ranges 0-6 mg/kg, 0-1.5 mg/kg, and 0-1 mg/kg oil, respectively. The concentrations of the three compounds in lower grade olive oils were significantly higher (P < .001) than that in EVOO. A similar difference was observed for other refined and cold-pressed vegetable oils. The limit of fraud detection of lower grade oils in EVOO was 2% when using 3-MCPD esters, 5% for 2-MCPD esters, and 13-14% for GEs based on calculations of virtual mixtures of the current sample set. Especially the MCPD esters appear very specific and promising for the detection of lower processing grade oils in EVOO.

AB White tea is highly consumed due to its sensory properties and health benefits, although most scientific reports don't include the analysis of both properties. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to unravel the best brewing conditions for optimal extraction of the bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacity, while realising the best sensory properties. Infusions of eighty commercial teas (sold in bags or leaves) were obtained at different time-temperature ratios, studying bioactive compounds (caffeine and individual catechins), antioxidant capacity and sensory analysis. Brewing at 98 degrees C for 7 min was the best condition to obtain a high content of antioxidant polyphenols and pleasant sensory properties. Those teas sold in bags give rise to tea brews with almost double antioxidant capacity. In conclusion, it is very important to link sensory and chemical data to obtain optimal sensorial quality and the highest healthy properties in white tea infusions.

AB Near-infrared (NIR) spectra contain abundant data, heterospectral two-dimensional correlation (H2D-CS) analysis offers a good way to interpret these data. For the first time, H2D-CS was used to correlate the NIR hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data with mid-infrared spectra and to identify feature-related wavebands for developing models for monitoring the oxidative damage of pork myofibrils during frozen storage. The HSI images were acquired at frozen state without thawing and the oxidative damage of myofibrils was assessed by carbonyl content. Results showed that the simplified PLSR model based on H2D-CS identified feature wavebands obtained determination coefficient in prediction (R-P(2)) of 0.896 and root mean square error in prediction (RMSEP) of 0.177 nmol/mg protein, which was better than the partial least square regression (PLSR) model based on full wavebands (R-P(2) = 0.856, RMSEP = 0.209 nmol/mg protein). Therefore, H2D-CS was effective in selecting feature-related wavebands of NIR HSI.

TI Bioaccessibility and potential bioavailability of phenolic compounds
   from achenes as a new target for strawberry breeding programs

AB Strawberry is a major natural source of bioactive compounds. Botanically, strawberry is an aggregate fruit consisting of a fleshy floral receptacle that bears a cluster of real dry fruits (achenes). Existing knowledge on the phenolic composition of achenes and its contribution to that of the whole fruit is limited. Also, the gastric and intestinal bioavailability of phenols is poorly known. In this work, a combination of spectrophotometric and HPLC-DAD methods was used to analyse the phenolic composition of whole fruits and achenes before and after in vitro digestion. Five different phenol families were identified. Also, achenes were found to contribute a sizeable fraction of phenolic acids and hydrolysable tannins in the whole fruit. Because the mere presence of phenolic compounds in a food matrix does not ensure their ready absorption and bioavailability, polyphenol potential bioavailability could be an effective selection criterion for strawberry breeding programs aimed at improving dietary healthiness.

AB A confirmatory method for the determination of colistin in animal tissues, egg, milk, and feed was developed and validated. Colistin A and colistin B were extracted from samples with the mixture of 10% trichloroacetic acid-acetonitrile and isolated with mixed-mode weak cation exchange cartridge. Analytes were separated from matrix components using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography, and detected with electrospray ionization on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Mean recoveries ranged from 78.0% to 115.6% with intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviation lower than 8.4% and 12.4%, respectively. The quantitation limits for different matrices were between 5 and 30 mu g/kg, which was satisfactory for surveillance monitoring. The developed method was applied to the analysis of real samples collected from different provinces of China, and 19 out of 348 samples were found to be contaminated, with the highest concentration of approximately 12,000 mu g/kg colistin A and 10,000 mu g/kg colistin B in feed.

AB This paper is focused on the effects of radio frequency (RF) heating on the relative activity of polyphenol oxidase (PPO), weight loss, texture, color, and microstructure of potatoes. The results showed that pure mushroom PPO was almost completely inactivated at 80 degrees C by RF heating. The relative activity of potato PPO reduced to less than 10% with increasing temperature (25-85 degrees C). Enzyme extract showed the lowest PPO relative activity at 85 degrees C after RF treatment, followed by the potato cuboids and mashed potato, about 0.19 +/- 0.017%, 3.24 +/- 0.19%, and 3.54 +/- 0.04%, respectively. Circular dichroism analysis indicated that RF heating changed the secondary structure of PPO, as alpha-helix content decreased. Both electrode gap and temperature had significant effect (P < .05) on weight loss, color, and texture of the potato cuboids. Microstructure analysis showed the changes of potato cell and starch during RF heating.

AB Cheese is a suitable matrix to deliver probiotic strains but it contains a high amount of sodium. The effect of partial substitution of NaCl by KCl and the addition of flavor enhancers (L-arginine, yeast and oregano extract) on probiotic Prato cheese was investigated after 1, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage (immediately after manufacturing, and during ripening and storage). Microbiological (lactic acid bacteria and probiotic Lactobacillus casei 01 counts and survival under gastrointestinal conditions), physicochemical (pH, proteolysis, fatty acids), bioactivity (antioxidant effect and angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity), rheological, and water mobility by means of time domain low-field nuclear magnetic resonance were investigated. Significant changes in probiotic survival were observed; however, the sodium reduction and the addition of flavor enhancers did not constitute an obstacle to L. casei 01 (> 10(8) CFU/g) during storage. Slight changes were observed in proteolysis, bioactivity, water mobility, texture profile, and fatty acids of the cheeses as a function of the flavor enhancer added. The sodium reduction and the supplementation of Prato cheese with probiotic cultures may be an effective alternative to the production of a potentially functional cheese.

AB The functionality of pale, soft, exudative (PSE)-like chicken protein was improved by isoelectric solubilization/ precipitation (ISP) treatment. PSE-like chicken proteins were solubilized at an acidic pH 3.5 or an alkaline pH 11.0, followed by precipitating at pH 5.5 and 6.2. PSE-like meat paste was treated as control (CON). Precipitated at pH 6.2 led to a more elastic gel than at pH 5.5. Water distribution of ISP-isolated protein was affected by precipitation pH. More tryptophan residues exposed and -SH was partially oxidized to disulfide bond after ISP treatment, which led to large aggregates formation and higher viscosity of ISP isolated proteins than of CON. Absolute zeta potential of alkali-treated protein was higher than other counterparts, indicating stronger electric repulsion. ISP treatments could convert a-helix structure to relatively irregular structures. Overall, solubilizing at pH 11.0, combined with a precipitation pH 6.2 ISP treatment offers a potential for enhanced functionality of PSE-like chicken protein.

AB Anthocyanins are flavonoids that have been suggested to provide beneficial health effects. The biological activity of anthocyanins is influenced by their pharmacokinetic properties, but anthocyanins are associated with limited bioavailability in humans. In the presented study, we investigated how the encapsulation of bilberry extract (BE), a source of anthocyanins, with either whey protein or citrus pectin influences the bioavailability and intestinal accessibility of anthocyanins in humans. We performed an intervention study that analyzed anthocyanins and their degradation products in the urine, plasma, and ileal effluent of healthy volunteers and ileostomists (subjects without an intact colon). We were able to show, that whey protein encapsulation modulated short-term bioavailability and that citrus pectin encapsulation increased intestinal accessibility during passage through the small intestine and modulated the formation of the degradation product phloroglucinol aldehyde (PGAL) in human plasma.

AB The effects were studied of two different adsorbent combinations (com I; bentonite:activated carbon:celite = 3:4:1 and com II; bentonite:activated clay: celite = 3:4:1 + 1% citric acid) on the physico-chemical changes of oil used continuously for deep-fat frying of chicken drumsticks. The results showed that the % FFA was reduced by 44.3, PV by 50.2, and FOS reading by 40.1% in com I whereas reductions of 41.6, 44.9, and 32.8%, respectively, were found in com II. The oil treated with com II exhibited a lighter color than with com I. The changes of oil color in com I were L* 30.7, a* 1.7, and b* 31.9%; in com II they were 53.2, 19.1, and 39.5% respectively. The higher the L* observed, the better the oil quality obtained because of the bleaching ability of adsorbents. Therefore, the use of such adsorbents is recommended for poultry processing.

AB Volatiles of papaya purees from four Costa Rican cultivars were analysed by solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 83 volatiles was assigned in the purees, of which 19 were detected for the first time as papaya constituents. As revealed by multivariate statistics, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), the purees may be allocated to terpene- and lactone-rich ('SH-5'), ester-containing ('Criolla'), and intermediate chemotypes ('Pococi' and 'Silvestre'). Descriptive sensory analysis and a consumer acceptance test were additionally performed. Floral, fruity, and honey-like notes were perceived at significantly higher intensities in 'SH-5' puree. The latter descriptors strongly correlated with volatiles discriminating 'SH-5' in the PCA and PLS-DA, respectively. Consumer acceptance of the papaya purees differed significantly. 'Pococi' and 'SH-5' purees appear to be suitable for improving the nutritional value of blended fruit juices without impairing their sensory quality.

AB Xenoestrogenic mycotoxins may contaminate food and feed posing a public health issue. Besides the zearalenone group, the Alternaria toxin alternariol (AOH) has been described as a potential mycoestrogen. However, the estrogenicity of Alternaria toxins is still largely overlooked and further data are needed to better describe the group toxicity. In the frame of risk assessment, mixed in silico/in vitro approaches already proved to be effective first-line analytical tools. An integrated in silico/in vitro approach was used to investigate the effects of metabolic and chemical modifications on the estrogenicity of AOH. Among the considered modifications, methylation was found critical for enhancing estrogenicity (as seen for alternariol monomethyl ether (AME)) while hydroxylation and glucuronidation had the opposite effect (as seen for 4-hydroxy AOH and 4-hydroxy AME). The structure-activity relationship analysis provided the structural rationale. Our results provide insights to design more efficient risk assessment studies expanding knowledge over the group toxicity.

AB Lentil fermentation has a promising potential as a strategy for development of multifunctional ingredients targeting metabolic syndrome (MetS). Response surface methodology was applied to optimize lentil fermentation and study its effects on generation of peptides, soluble phenolics and bioactivities. Fermentation using Lactobacillus plantarum and Savinase (R) 16 L was carried out at different pH (6.5-8.5) and times (5.5-30 h). Analysis of variance was performed to evaluate linear, quadratic and interaction effects between fermentation parameters. pH positively affected peptides, soluble phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity whereas a negative impact on lipase inhibitory activity was observed (p < .0001). Time showed positive effect on proteolysis and negatively affected angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity of fermented lentil (p < .0001). Multivariate optimization led to high levels of peptides, soluble phenolics and bioactivity of fermented lentil at pH 8.5 and 11.6 h. In conclusion, this study might contribute to the development of functional ingredients from lentil for MetS management.

AB In this study, a series of functional oils rich in feruloylated structured lipids (FSLs) was prepared by enzymatic transesterification of ethyl ferulate (EF) with triglycerides under ultrasound pretreatment. A conversion of more than 92.7% and controllable FSLs (3.1%-26.3%) can be obtained under the following conditions: 16% enzyme, substrate ratio 1:5 (oil/EF, mol/mol), 85 degrees C, ultrasound 1 h, pulse mode 3 s/3s (working/waiting), and 17.0 W/mL. Compared to conventional mechanical stirring, the activation energy decreased from 50.0 kJ/mol to 40.7 kJ/mol. The apparent kinetic constant increased by more than 13 times, and the time required for the maximum conversion reduced sharply from 20-60 h to 4-6h, which was the fastest rate for enzymatic synthesis of FSLs. The antioxidant activities of the functional oil significantly increased 1.0- to 8.1-fold more than that of the raw oil. The functional oil could be widely applied in various fields of functional foods.

AB Mechanical flour modification is frequently associated with a reduced bread volume due to changed structural and functional properties of protein and starch. To clarify the effect of mechanical flour treatment on the protein network formation at the optimum kneading time (Peaktime), dough was produced with various mechanical starch modification (MSM) levels and visualized by confocal laser scanning microscope before being characterized by protein network analysis (PNA). Dough produced with high MSM showed a reduced branching rate (-14%), a high end-point rate (+25%) and an increased lacunarity (+139%), indicating a poor network connectivity with network interruptions. Alterations of the protein microstructure were closely related to the rheological dough properties. In this regard, reduced extensibility and resistance to extension of dough produced with high MSM levels were responsible for decreased dough height (Hm) during fermentation and thus might be the cause for lower baking volume of bread produced with high MSM.

   PROTECTION
AB Ethyl carbamate (EC), a chemical substance widely present in fermented food products and alcoholic beverages, has been classified as a Group 2A carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). New evidence indicates that long-term exposure to EC may cause neurological disorders. Formation of EC in food and its metabolism have therefore been studied extensively and analytical methods for EC in various food matrices have been established. Due to the potential threat of EC to human health, mitigation strategies for EC in food products by physical, chemical, enzymatic, and genetic engineering methods have been developed. Natural products are suggested to provide protection against EC-induced toxicity through the modulation of oxidative stress. This review summarizes knowledge on the formation and metabolism of EC, detection of EC in food products, toxic effects of EC on various organs, and mitigation strategies including prevention of EC-induced tumorigenesis and genotoxicity by natural products.

AB Foods meet acid pH during gastric digestion after cooking. An in situ infrared microspectroscopy approach was developed to detect the effects of heat and acid treatments on protein structure separately. Infrared spectra were obtained from meat samples treated with heat and/or acid, and wavenumbers accounting independently for the treatments were extracted by principal component regression. Extreme-acid treatment (pH(initial) 2.0) was well predicted (0.5% error) by a simple ratio of as-observed spectral intensities at 1211 and 1396 cm(-1), reflecting a perturbation in the vibration of amino acid residues (phenylalanine, tyrosine and aspartic acid) by protein unfolding and protonation. Using the imaging mode of an IR microscope, meat protein acidification was evidenced with high spatial resolution. The heat effect was well discriminated from the acid effect by the ratio of as-observed intensities at 1666 and 1697 cm(-1) (0.9% error), indicating content of aggregated beta-sheets relative to alpha-helix structure.

AB The pathogenesis and the underlying mechanism of endothelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer remain unclear. Plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1), a novel long non-coding RNA maps to 8q24.21, and in many tumor studies the up-regulation of PVT1 has already been reported. PVT1 is closely related to tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. In this study, we employed a combination of techniques to study the role of PVT1 in prostate cancer, which included bioinformatic analysis, Western blotting and cell migration assays of prostate cancer cell lines. We report that PVT1 promotes prostate cancer invasion and metastasis by modulating EMT. Furthermore, PVT1 can promote EMT by up-regulation of Twist1, a transcription factor associated with EMT. We then confirmed that PVT1 acts as a sponge for miRNA-186-5p and positively regulates Twist1 by a sponge effect. Therefore, this study has revealed a novel MECHANISM for the promotion of EMT in prostate cancer by PVT1. Our findings suggest that the PVT1/miR-186/Twist1 regulatory axis may be a new therapeutic target for prostate cancer.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, single stranded RNA molecules with approximately 22 nts in length, which regulate the stability and translation of messenger RNAs in several organisms. To increase the repertoire of miRNAs characterized in M. amblycephala, we used the deep sequencing technology to sequence a small RNA library using pooled RNA sample isolated from the 4 different tissues of M. amblycephala. A total of 309 conserved miRNAs that originated from 131 miRNA families were detected. 15 novel candidates miRNA were identified. Randomly selected 6 miRNAs were analyzed by stem-loop qRT-PCR and differential expression patterns were observed in 6 different tissues of M. amblycephala. Furthermore, the potential targets were predicted. GO analysis showed that most of the targets were involved in a broad range of physiological functions including fish growth, development, metabolism, stress responses and so on. Overall, our results significantly increased the number of novel miRNAs in M. amblycephala, which should be useful for further investigation into the role of miRNAs in regulating diverse biological processes.

AB This study involves investigations on the Upper Paleoproterozoic iron formation (viz., Seosan iron formation) from the Seosan Group, Gyeonggi Massif of the southwestern Korean Peninsula. It occurs as thin banded layers within meta-arkosic sandstone, formed by alternating processes of chemical (hydrothermal) and detrital depositions under a shallow marine environment. It mainly consists of alternating layers of iron oxides, mostly hematite, and quartz. Minor amounts of magnetite surrounded by muscovite, clinopyroxene and amphibole indicate hydrothermal alteration since its formation. Meta-arkosic sandstone is composed of recrystallized or porphyroclastic quartz and microcline, with small amounts of hematite and pyrite clusters. The Seosan iron formation has high contents of total Fe2O3 and SiO2 with positive Eu anomalies similar to those of other Precambrian banded iron formations, and its formation is clearly related to hydrothermal alteration since its deposition. Detrital zircon SHRIMP U-Pb geochronology data from a meta-arkosic sandstone (SN-1) and an iron formation (SN-2) show mainly two age groups of ca. 2.5 Ga and ca. 1.9-1.75 Ga. This together with intrusion age of the granite gneiss (ca. 1.70-1.65 Ga) clearly indicate that the iron formations were deposited during the Upper Paleoproterozoic. The dominant Paleoproterozoic detrital zircon bimodal age peaks preserved in the Seosan iron formation compare well with those from the South China Craton sedimentary basins, reflecting global tectonic events related to the Columbia supercontinent in East Asia.

AB The Eastern Pontides Orogenic Belt, one of the best examples of a fossil continental arc in the Alpine-Himalayan system, is characterized by adakitic magmatism during the Early Cenozoic. Popular models correlate the adakitic magmatism to syn- or post-collisional processes occurring after the collision between the Eastern Pontides Orogenic Belt and the Tauride Platform at the end of Late Mesozoic and/or beginning of the Cenozoic. We present new geological, petrological and chronological data from andesites and felsic tuffs exposed in the Bayburt area, in the southern part of the Eastern Pontides Orogenic Belt, and discuss the nature of the transition from adakitic to non-adakitic activities in a continental arc. Major, trace and rare earth element concentrations of both andesites and felsic tuffs clearly suggest that they are related to arc magmatism in a continental arc with adakitic composition. The isotopic compositions are permissive of mixing between a component similar to depleted mantle and a second component that is either mafic lower crust or subducted oceanic crust. Ar-39/Ar-40 hornblende and U/Pb zircon dating indicate that this adakitic magmatism in the Bayburt area ended by about 47 Ma, and transformed into non-adakitic, granitoid arc magmatism in the area immediately north of Bayburt in the Lutetian (similar to 46 Ma). Based on our new results in conjunction with available data, we propose that the beginning of northward rollback of a south-directed subducting slab, and simultaneous opening of a slab window related to ridge subduction, triggered both adakitic magmatism for approximately a 10 Myr period between 57.6 and 47 Ma and arc-parallel extension that caused the opening of the Early Cenozoic sedimentary basins. We also suggest that the shallow marine environment, in which Nummulite-bearing sandy limestones accumulated in the Early Cenozoic, was transformed into a saline-lake environment during the pyroclastic activity that produced the studied felsic tuffs at similar to 47 Ma.

AB We present the SHRIMP U-Pb detrital zircon and K-Ar illite 1M(d)/1M and 2M(1) ages, suggesting new insight into the Phanerozoic polyphase orogenies preserved in the northeastern Okcheon Belt, Korea since the initial basin formation during Neoproterozoic rifting through several successive contractional orogens. The U-Pb detrital zircon ages from the Early Paleozoic strata of the Taebaeksan Zone suggest a Cambrian maximum deposition age, and are supported by trilobite and conodont biostratigraphy. Although the age spectra from two sedimentary groups, the Yeongwol and Taebaek Groups, show similar continuous distributions from the Late Paleoproterozoic to Early Paleozoic ages, a Grenville-age hiatus (1.3-0.9 Ga) in the continuous stratigraphic sequence from the Taebaek Group suggests the existence of different peripheral clastic sources along rifted continental margin(s). In addition, we present the K-Ar illite 1M(d)/1M ages of the fault gouges, which confirm fault formation/reactivation during the Late Cretaceous to Early Paleogene (ca. 82-62 Ma) and the Early Miocene (ca. 20-18 Ma). The 2M(1) illite ages, at least those younger than the host rock ages, provide episodes of deformation, metamorphism and hydrothermal effects related to the tectonic events during the Devonian (ca.410 Ma) and Permo-Triassic (ca. 285-240 Ma). These results indicate that the northeastern Okcheon Belt experienced polyphase orogenic events, namely the Okcheon (Middle Paleozoic), Songrim (Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic), Daebo (Middle Mesozoic) and Bulguksa (Late Mesozoic to Early Cenozoic) Orogenies, reflecting the Phanerozoic tectonic evolution of the Korean Peninsula along the East Asian continental margin.

AB We present a reduction-consistent and thermodynamically consistent formulation and an associated numerical algorithm for simulating the dynamics of an isothermal mixture consisting of N(N >= 2) immiscible incompressible fluids with different physical properties (densities, viscosities, and pair-wise surface tensions). By reduction consistency we refer to the property that if only a set of M(1 <= M <= N - 1) fluids are present in the system then the N-phase governing equations and boundary conditions will exactly reduce to those for the corresponding M-phase system. By thermodynamic consistency we refer to the property that the formulation honors the thermodynamic principles. Our N-phase formulation is developed based on a more general method that allows for the systematic construction of reduction-consistent formulations, and the method suggests the existence of many possible forms of reduction-consistent and thermodynamically consistent N-phase formulations. Extensive numerical experiments have been presented for flow problems involving multiple fluid components and large density ratios and large viscosity ratios, and the simulation results are compared with the physical theories or the available physical solutions. The comparisons demonstrate that our method produces physically accurate results for this class of problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In topology optimization of electromagnetic waves, the Gateaux differentiability of the conjugate operator to the complex field variable results in the complexity of the adjoint sensitivity, which evolves the original real-valued design variable to be complex during the iterative solution procedure. Therefore, the self-inconsistency of the adjoint sensitivity is presented. To enforce the self-consistency, the real part operator has been used to extract the real part of the sensitivity to keep the real-value property of the design variable. However, this enforced self-consistency can cause the problem that the derived structural topology has unreasonable dependence on the phase of the incident wave. To solve this problem, this article focuses on the self-consistent adjoint analysis of the topology optimization problems for electromagnetic waves. This self-consistent adjoint analysis is implemented by splitting the complex variables of the wave equations into the corresponding real parts and imaginary parts, sequentially substituting the split complex variables into the wave equations with deriving the coupled equations equivalent to the original wave equations, where the infinite free space is truncated by the perfectly matched layers. Then, the topology optimization problems of electromagnetic waves are transformed into the forms defined on real functional spaces instead of complex functional spaces; the adjoint analysis of the topology optimization problems is implemented on real functional spaces with removing the variational of the conjugate operator; the self-consistent adjoint sensitivity is derived, and the phase-dependence problem is avoided for the derived structural topology. Several numerical examples are implemented to demonstrate the robustness of the derived self-consistent adjoint analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Based on the free volume, shear transformation zone and percolation theory, a new percolation model has been established to investigate the ductile-brittle transition in amorphous alloys. Taking the binary Cu(2)sZr(7)s amorphous alloy for example, the influence of the free volume concentration and flow unit dispersity on its percolation threshold value was analyzed. The results show that the concentration of flow units reach a critical value when the ductile-brittle transition occurs in the Cu25Zr75 amorphous alloy, and this critical value is independent of the concentration of the free volume but dependent on the dispersity of flow units. Furthermore, the percolation threshold values of La-, Zr-, Cu-, Pd-, Fe-, Sr- and Tm-based amorphous alloys were also calculated, a percolation threshold value of 0.516 for ductile-brittle transition in these amorphous alloys was obtained. Therefore, our analysis results suggest that 0.516 appears to be a universal percolation threshold value for ductile-brittle transition in amorphous alloys.

AB The presence of reduced zirconium in fluorozirconate (FZ) glasses is highly unfavorable due to its detrimental effect on glass quality. Previous researchers have relied upon the use of a fluorine-containing processing gas to prevent the reduction of zirconium in FZ glasses deposited as thin films by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). However, the use of a fluorine-containing processing gas as an oxidizing agent is disadvantageous, due to its toxicity. Eliminating the need for the processing gas would lead to a significantly safer and simpler process. Our approach is to incorporate indium, which is multivalent, into the PLD ablation target in order to stabilize the zirconium and remove the need for a processing gas. A ZLANI glass, based on the composition 60.24ZrF(4)-4.13LaF(3)-3.54AlF(3)-31.49NaF-0.59InF(3) (values are in mol%), was synthesized for use as an ablation target. Using the ZLANI target, FZ glass films were successfully deposited on fused silica substrates by HD, without the need for any processing gas. Multiple depositions were performed to observe the effects of deposition duration on growth rate and on film roughness. The deposited films are transparent with a brownish coloration. The source of this coloration is postulated to be color centers that are created during synthesis. Thermal annealing increases light transmission through the films up to 400%, depending upon wavelength, in the UV and visible spectrum (350-600 nm), after a series of heat treatments culminating at 300 T. The fact that the transparency of the films can be correlated to annealing temperature suggests that the films may be of use as passive temperature sensors.

AB This research introduces a new bioactive glass-ceramic material based on canasite and calcium phosphate with different molar ratios in the range from 2 to 0.5. The glass-ceramics were obtained by controlled two-stage heat treatment of the parent glass (encoded G) at different temperatures (700, 800, 900 and 1000 degrees C, encoded C700, C800, C900 and C1000, respectively). The glass and glass-ceramics were characterized by DTA, XRD, FTIR and SEM. The four point bending strength was also measured. In vitro bioacdvity of the selected samples was investigated in SBF, and the cytotoxicity test was performed by culturing the samples with normal human lung fibroblast cells (WI-38 cells) and baby hamster kidney cell line (BHK cells). The results of XRD analyses showed that crystalline phases of frankamenite/canasite-A and fluorapatite were detected, and xonotlite crystal phase was formed at high heat-treatment temperature. The bending strength was significantly affected by the heat treatment temperature. It increased with increasing crystallization temperature. SEM micrographs showed a homogeneous microstructure of interlocked needle-and rod-like crystals. Moreover, immersion of the samples in SBF demonstrated that the samples G and C900 showed a relatively better ability than other two samples. The results of the cytotoxicity test showed that cytocompatibility behavior of the samples was varied with the type of cell line. G sample showed a significant higher viability than C900 sample with the WI-38 cell line for all sample concentrations, while, this significant viability differences were not observed at low and high sample concentrations cultured with BHK cells.

AB Cellulose-silica aerogels (CSAs) are organic-inorganic hybrid composites possessing both the porous characteristics and high mechanical properties. In this paper, two kinds of CSAs were in-situ synthesized by facile one-step impregnating cellulose layers directly into silica hydrosols and alcosols, respectively. The porous microstructures and the bonding linkage were investigated by means of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nitrogen adsorption-desorption porosimetry. The results show that the silica particles successfully in-situ crosslink on/into the cellulose matrix and maintain the porous characteristics. The regeneration of the CM directly in the alcosols is more beneficial to realize the crosslinking between silica particles and cellulose fibrils. The silica modification tends to increase the mechanical properties over those of the CM due to the additional effects of silica particles impregnating into cellulose matrix.

AB The effect of composition tuning on glass forming ability (GFA), mechanical properties and atomic structure in ZrxCo84-xAl16 bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) with x = 51-58 has been investigated by using copper-mold suction casting, nanoindentation, high-energy X-ray diffraction, extended X-ray absorption fee structure experiments and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, respectively. It is found that GM firstly increases then decreases with Increasing Zr content, exhibiting a maximum diameter of 7 nun with the Zr content of 55 and 56, while an abrupt reduction of bending plasticity occurs as the Zr content drops below 55. Both experimental and theoretical results find that GFA is remarkably enhanced, due to the abnormal reduction in the fractions of the Co-centered <0, 2, 8, 1>, <0, 3, 6, 2> and <0, 3, 6, 3> polyhedra, and the denser atomic packing of Zr atoms around center Co atom, as the Zr content increases from 51 to 56. Meanwhile, the simultaneously improved plasticity is associated with the increased Co-centered <0, 3, 6, 0>, and Al-centered <0, 2, 8, 1> and <0, 3, 6, 2> polyhedra, which provide more fertile sites for the nucleation of shear transformations. Further Zr addition to 58 increases remarkably the fractions of Zr- and Al-centered <0, 1, 10, 2> and <0, 3, 6, 4> polyhedra, and causes looser atomic packing of Co atoms around center Zr atom, leading to the reduction in GFA. However, the plasticity is not enhanced further but remains nearly constant, which may be related to the deteriorated effect on plasticity of the decreased fractions of Zr-centered <0, 1, 10, 5> and Co-centered <0, 3, 6, 0> polyhedra, and the increased fractions of Zr-centered <0, 1, 10, 3> and <0, 2, 8, 4> and Co-centered <0, 2, 8, 0> polyhedra. Compositional tuning, with internal structure tuned to favor both GFA and plastic flow, offers new possibilities in developing ductile BMG materials.

AB A Zr65Al7.5Ni10Cu12.5Ag5 bulk metallic glass (BMG) containing immiscible elements was prepared in the diameter range up to 5 mm by injection copper mold casting. The effects of the laser surface melting (LSM) treatment on the surface composition and mechanical properties of the Zr-based BMG were examined. It is found that the plasticity of the ISM-treated specimens is improved significantly by 50% as compared with that of the as-cast ones, accompanied by the enrichment of Zr content through the reductions in Cu and Ag elements by ISM-induced evaporation. It is further noticed that the enhancement of plastic deformability is much distinct for the specimen with a larger size. The effects of ISM treatment is studied by considering the ISM-treated specimen as a kind of composite with the uninfluenced zone as the substrate and the influenced zone as the second phase. The plasticity enhancement of ISM treatment is closely related to the interaction between the influenced zone and the uninfluenced zone. Furthermore, it is assumed that the effectiveness of ISM treatment in plasticity enhancement will decrease when the volume fraction of the influenced zone exceeds a critical value due to the lack of interaction between the influenced zone and the uninfluenced zone, which is consistent with the experimental results. These results are promising for extending the applications of ISM treatment for the improvement of mechanical properties of BMGs.

AB The corrosion behavior of Ca65-xMg10+xZn25 (z = 0,10) and Ca32Mg12Zn38Yb18 alloys was studied by potendiodynamic tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in Ringer's solution. The solution of NaCl, KCl and CaCl2 components reacted with outer layer of alloys and produced corrosion products. The influence of Ca content on the hydrogen volume as a function of time was discussed. The measurements exhibited significantly less hydrogen evolution volumes for Ca55Mg20Zn25 alloy (5.0 ml/cm(2)) than for Ca65Mg10Zn25 glass (11.3 ml/cm(2)) after 2 h. The lowest value of hydrogen evolution was observed for Ca32Mg12Zn38Yb18 glass (1.1 ml/cm(2)). The hydrogen volume for Ca(32)Zn(38)Mg(12)Yb(18)This sample fulfilled the non-toxic amount of 112, which must be low than similar to 1 ml/h. The XPS survey spectra for the glassy samples after corrosion test in Ringer's solution represent the surface components. The corrosion products were identified as to be CaCO3, Mg(OH)(2), CaO, MgO and ZnO compounds. In addition, the EDS and X-ray analysis of a layer of corrosion products after immersion tests in Ringer's solution identified calcium and ytterbium hydroxide, calcium carbonate and also calcium zinc hydroxide hydrate.

AB An innovative approach was developed to synthesize calcium sulfate whiskers by dropwise adding sulfuric acid solution into abundant concentrated calcium nitrate solution under atmospheric pressure. The effect of mixing styles of reactants on product morphology was determined by SEM. Combined with SEM, XRD, TG-DSC were used to characterize products. Dihydrate CaSO4 whiskers with high aspect ratios (approximate 93.5) could be directly synthesized at room temperature. Then, the whiskers transformed to hemi-hydrate and anhydrous CaSO4 whiskers after heat treatment using microwave at 140 degrees C and 180 degrees C, respectively. The latter whiskers also own high aspect ratios. In addition, nitric acid (concentration, 170 g/L) was regenerated in the same process of three single-phase and well crystallized CaSO4 whiskers synthesis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this letter, high-performance TiO2/BiFeO3 heterostructure thin film is successfully prepared by introducing sol-gel derived-TiO2 (SG-TiO2) electron transport layer. A significant improvement of photovoltaic performance has been achieved. 3.674% power conversion efficiency of the thin film is obtained with open-circuit voltage (V-oc) of 1.64 V, short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of 3.5 mA/cm(2) and fill factor (FF) of 64%, which implies that the introduction of a TiO2 would improve the photovoltaic performance under visible light illumination. Our work demonstrates that the TiO2/BFO heterostructure thin film possesses the potential for better use in the solar energy devices applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB TiO2-based anodes are highly desired because of their significant safety with good structural stability during charge/discharge. However, the intrinsic poor conductivity of TiO2 restricts its capacity cycling at a high rate. Herein, we present a good rate-performance anode consisting of Ni-encapsulated TiO2 nanotube array growing on three-dimensional Ni scaffold. By using atomic layer deposition (ALD), a TiO2 layer was coated onto Ni nanotubes which were fabricated using ZnO nanorod array template. The Ni-encapsulated TiO2 nanotube array anode shows a capacity of 188 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5 C. The metal Ni encapsulated in the TiO2 nanotubes provides an efficient pathway for rapid electron transfer. It is believed that the metal-encapsulated composite design presented here would be significant for many possible anodes and cathodes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The oxygen atoms promoted the formation of nucleation sites of alpha-Mg under high pressure, including fine cells (12-13 mu m), and reduced the number of defect bands compared to the DC Mg-9Al alloy (14-15 mu m). The relation between hardness and phase spacing indicated that the dispersion strengthening of the beta-phase was dominant. The DC Mg-O-9Al alloy exhibited enhanced tensile properties as compared to the DC Mg-9Al alloy. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, the SnO2-graphene-carbon (SnO2-G-C) nanofibers are synthetized via an electrospinning method and employed as potential KIB anodes. The SnO2-G-C anodes exhibit a great cycling stability of 202.06 mA h/g over 100 cycles at the current density of 100 mA/g, as well as the high rate capacity of 114.81 mA h/g at 1 A/g. The enhanced electrochemical properties of SnO2-G-C comparing to SnO2-carbon (SnO2-C) counterpart can be ascribed to the dispersive graphene inside the carbon nanofibers, which offers flexible buffer matrix and protects the active materials from destruction. Meanwhile, the graphene facilitates the electrons transportation, leading to the good rate capability. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The active alcohol sensing component Co3O4 nanoparticles (Co3O4 NPs) were coated on dense and porous MgAl2O4 substrates using a wet chemical based dip coating technique followed by annealing in air at 400 degrees C. The morphology of the Co3O4 NPs found to be different for the porous and dense substrate. The Co3O4 NPs coated MgAl2O4 substrate-based sensor exhibited better alcohol sensitivity at low-temperature as compared to dense substrate counterpart. The porous substrate offers more active sites for gas adsorption and subsequent surface reaction leading to good sensitivity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The initial multilayer-structure two-dimensional transition metal carbide MXene (as-Ti3C2Tx) are synthesized by selectively etching M(n+1)AX(n) in HF, and the surface of MXene adhere to some functional groups. Intercalation and delamination by ultrasonication in alcohol or DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) produce less lamellar structure of resultant (d-Ti3C2Tx) and change the surface circumstance. This fabricated fewer-sheets samples not only improve the electrical conductibility, specific area, but also reduce the ion diffusion resistance. Meanwhile, the d-aTi(3)C(2)T(x) and d-D-Ti3C2Tx show outstanding capacity of 110 or 120 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) with coulombic efficiency of about 95%, which lead to 26% increase compared with as-Ti3C2Tx (95 mAh g(-1)) for sodium-ion batteries, and remarkable capacitance retention of 84.5% or 85.8% after cycles for in alcohol and DMSO, respectively.

AB Fullerene-like hydrogenated carbon films deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) as compared with other methods can attain super-low friction and wear. But they often have bad adhesion to steel substrate and their structures are tailored by non-metal elements as F, N etc. In this work, we have prepared the films on steel balls by the combination of PECVD and plasma nitriding, among which iron nitride particles are sputtered and introduced in the films. The films have longer wear life and better adhesion to the steel substrate due to the N diffusion from iron nitride particles to the atom matrix of the ball. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Progress in the design and fabrication of thermal barrier coating (TBC) is strongly dependent on the application of new materials and deposition methods. In this work, one novel and efficient plasma spraying method was employed to deposit a La2Ce2O7 (LC)/YSZ gradient TBC using a synchronous dual powder feeding system, in which the melting state and feeding rate of LC or YSZ feedstock powder can be precisely controlled. The experimental and simulation results suggested that the as-sprayed LC/YSZ TBC presented an obvious gradient change along the coating thickness direction. The heat insulation temperature and thermal cycling property of gradient TBC were greatly improved compared to its double-layer-structured counterpart due to the increased interfaces and deflection of fatigue cracks resulted from the gradient structure.

AB Pure, Ho3+-and Ho3+/Yb3+-modified PSN-PMN-PT crystals are grown by using the flux method. A series of absorption peaks related to Ho3+ and Yb3+ ions are detected at VIS-NIR bands. Under the excitation of 980 nm laser, bright UC PLs are observed for Ho3+-and Ho3+/Yb3+-modified systems. The lifetime from F-5(4)/S-5(2) energy level of Ho3+ and absolute QY-UC for Ho3+/Yb3+-modified crystals are 56.15/182.42 ls and 0.056%, respectively. These findings make the PSN-PMN-PT crystals become a promising candidate in colour displays, solid-state lasers, and optical memories. It also gives us a expectation to develop ferroelectric crystals to a new multifunctional materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of the addition of Mo and C elements on the microstructure and room-temperature mechanical properties of Fe40Mn40Co10Cr10 high-entropy alloy (HEA) were investigated. The yield strength of the HEA increased from 240 MPa to 560 MPa through the addition of 1 wt.% Mo and 1 wt.% C. The strengthening mechanism of the HEA was found to be mainly attributed to the solid-solution strengthening. Surprisingly, the addition of Mo and C also prompt the deformation twinning in the HEA, which enhances the working hardening ability and basically maintains the large plasticity.

DE Ferroelectric; Pulsed laser deposition; Thin films; Optical properties
AB The Ba(Fe1/2Nb1/2)O-3 (BFNO) thin films have been successfully deposited on (1 0 0) SrTiO3 substrates by pulsed laser deposition. The structural characteristics, micro-topography and optical properties have been investigated. X-ray diffraction patterns suggest that all the films are good crystallization and show c-axis orientation. The X-ray photoelectron spectra analyses confirm the successful synthesis of BFNO material, and reveal the existence of the oxygen vacancies. The photoluminescence (PL) measurement is used to analyze the optical properties and carriers recombination mechanisms. The BFNO films have a narrow band gap of 1.37 eV, which show potential roles in solar cells and other photoelectric devices. According to the PL measurement, carriers recombination mechanisms are related with excitonic radiative recombination in our samples. This research not only lays a solid foundation on further researching BFNO thin films, but also opens an avenue to design various multifunctional devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel barium titanate@poly(dopamine)@graphene oxide (from inner to outer) (denoted as BT@PDA@GO) multilayer core-shell hybrids were synthesized in this study. Then, the BT@PDA@GO multilayer core-shell hybrids were incorporated into NBR matrix to prepared dielectric elastomer composite. The results showed that the dielectric constant of NBR composite filled with BT@PDA@GO hybrids reached to 15 at 1 kHz, which was about 170% times larger than that of pure NBR, whereas the dielectric loss was just about 0.02 at 1 kHz. In addition, the BT@PDA@GO/NBR composite exhibited a large actuated strain of 8.6% at electric field of 35 kV/mm, about 200% times of pure NBR (4.2%) at the same electric field. This research might help to establish a new strategy to obtain a high performance dielectric elastomer actuator. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Size and shape controlled nickel oxide/nickel vanadate (NiO/Ni3V2O8) nanocomposites were achieved by solvothermal method. Ammonium metavanadate and nickel chloride precursor solution in appropriate proportion was dissolved in solvent with sodium hydroxide as reducing and stabilizing agent. Three different products were obtained by varying solvothermal processing time as 10 h, 14 h and 18 h at 160 degrees C. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), Raman and photo luminescence (PL) studies substantiate NiO/Ni3V2O8 formation. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) studies provides detailed information about NiO/Ni3V2O8 nanorods configuration. Electrochemical studies were carried out to understand pseudocapacitive properties of obtained products. Estimated specific capacitance for product PVK1 has superior value as 653 Fg (1) at current density 1 Ag (1) due to nanorods regular arrangement with uniform size distribution. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB We present a simple design of a dual-band plasmonic perfect absorber (PA) based on all-metal nanostructure for ultra-sensitive refractive index (RI) sensing applications in infrared region. The proposed PA is only consisted of an assembly of vertical-split-ring (VSR) structure array adhered on a continuous gold film. The numerical simulation results show that the designed PA can achieve absorbance of 99.1% and 98.8% with quality-factor (Q-factor) of 16.4 and 19.8 at 163.6 THz and 258.8 THz, respectively. The physical origin of the observed absorption is elucidated through distributions of magnetic field and power loss density at resonances. The designed PA served as a refractive index (RI) sensor can achieve sensitivity of 1518 and 959 nm/refractive index unit (RIU), respectively. The proposed dual-band PA could be a desirable candidate for applications in the RI sensing, notch filtering and the enhanced infrared spectroscopy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FILMS
AB Gold (Au) metal catalysed tapered Silicon Nanowires (SiNWs) of diameter 50-150 nm at the base and length of 0.8-2.5 mm are synthesised by VLS mechanism using Silane (SiH4) as a precursor gas in Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD) reactor at a substrate temperature of 650 degrees C. In this work, the effect of plasma power on the growth morphology of SiNWs is studied with two different thicknesses of Au catalyst layer. The catalyst layers are deposited using thermal evaporation system. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) images confirm the growth of randomly oriented tapered nanowires. From the FESEM studies, it is clear that the density and the length of SiNWs increases with the increase of plasma power. High-resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) demonstrated that the SiNWs are highly crystalline with (1 1 1) and (2 2 0) plane orientation. Raman spectra of SiNWs have been analysed and the first order optical phonons for SiNWs is observed at 519 cm(-1) with 1 nm and 514.82 cm(-1) with 2 nm Au catalyst. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V.

AB One of the best materials for preparation of ion conductive membranes is poly[2,2'-(p-phenylene)-5,5'-bisbenzimidazole] denoted p-PBI. Here we report the preparation of potassium hydroxide doped p-PBI membranes, loaded with high concentrations of montmorillonite and discuss some of their properties. The doped PBI membranes, containing filler, show considerable increase of the anion conductivity as well as improvement of mechanical properties, compared to pristine p-PBI doped with potassium hydroxide. For the membrane, containing 100 wt% montmorillonite, anion conductivity of 1465 mS. cm(-1) was measured. This value is approaching the anion conductivity of the dopant -50% water solution of potassium hydroxide. The improvement of the anion conductivity has to be attributed to the electrolyte, trapped in the montmorillonite channels. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a template-assisted approach for novel hierarchical CuO nanoflowers with Cu2O nanocubes as the templates was designed and carried out. The structures and morphologies in different growth processes were studied by various characterization methods, showing that these hierarchical CuO nanoflowers consisted of ultrathin nanosheets. The hierarchical CuO nanoflowers serving as active materials illustrated great performances for non-enzymatic glucose sensing with high sensitivity of 2217 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), low detection limit of 0.96 mu M and wide linear range up to 6 mM. Moreover, the electrodes exhibited quick response time, long term stability, good selectivity and acceptable practice workability, suggesting the great potential of the as-prepared CuO nanoflowers in non-enzymatic glucose sensors.

AB Cu-Zn-Co oxide nanoflakes were grown on Ni-foam using a hydrothermal method. FESEM revealed a thin nanoflake-like morphology. The Cu-Zn-Co oxide nanoflakes exhibited a maximum specific capacity of 215 C g(-1) at a scan rate of 5 mV s(-1) and 178 C g(-1) at a specific current of 1 A g(-1). When used as a Liion battery electrode, the Cu-Zn-Co oxide nanoflakes exhibited a specific discharge capacity of 1117 m A h g(-1) in the second cycle with excellent cycling stability. This superior cycling stability of the Cu-ZnCo oxide nanoflakes was attributed to the direct attachment of Cu-Zn-Co oxide nanoflakes on Ni-foam. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Self-doped truncated bipyramidal Bi2O2CO3 was synthesized for the first time. The structural and optical properties of the as-prepared samples were investigated systematically. The results indicated that the amount of the doped Bi5+, morphology and band gap of the Bi2O2CO3 could be controlled easily by adjusting the amount of NaHCO3. All the samples synthesized by this facile method exhibited obvious absorption in the visible light region. The sample obtained with the molar ratio 8 of NaHCO3 to NaBiO3 center dot 2H(2)O showed the highest photocatalytic activity for degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light irradiation.

We demonstrate that organic superacid passivation of CuInS2 quantum dots significantly improves photoluminescence, with no significant changes in particle size, composition, or structure. We propose organic superacid passivation reduces surface promoted non-radiative decay. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Antibacterial biomaterial such as nano silver or nano zinc oxide has been utilized on the surface of hydroxyapatite (HA) to promote its antibacterial activity. However, it is difficult to obtain a balance between antibacterial activity and biocompatibility. In this paper, an innovative strategy is presented to fabricate HA nanomaterial with a strong antibacterial activity and a good biocompatibility. HA generated with surface deposition of nano silver and nano zinc oxide was fabricated by a two-step liquid chemical reduction method. XRD confirmed the success of dual deposition. Ion release testing indicated the dual deposition increased silver ion release rate and zinc ion release rate simultaneously. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multiferroic materials BiFeO3-xBiYO(3) (BFO-xBYO) (x = 0, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08 and 0.10) were synthesized by traditional solid phase method. Subsequently, the samples were tested for X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques, magnetic field (M-H) hysteresis loops, field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM), and magneticdielectric effect (MD). The magneticdielectric properties of such a composite were investigated versus room temperature, frequency (0.02 Hz to 2000 kHz) and magnetic field (1.4, 1.8 Tesla). The obtained values of the magnetodielectric (MD) for x = 0.08 ceramic sample was ideal, and the Mr = 0.1698 emu/g and Ms = 1.0541 emu/g were relatively higher, respectively. These results promise multi-ferroic BFO as potential candidate for manipulating magnetism through an electric field and provide great opportunities towards magnetoelectrically tunable multiferroic devices.

AB Halide perovskites have recently emerged as a promising material for low cost and high efficiency solar cells. Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) are the forerunners of perovskite solar cells. In liquid based dye sensitized solar cell the power conversion efficiency is low and also it had some stability issues. In 2012, a long term stable and high efficiency perovskite solar cell emerged by replacing liquid electrolyte with the solid hole conductor. The attractiveness of organometal halide perovskites are having suitable direct bandgap with large absorption coefficients, low cost and solution based fabrication process. This review summarizes the basic concepts of perovskite, their fabrication and its eminent properties. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB BiFeO3 nanoparticles (BFO-NPs) have been successfully synthesized through modified microwave-assisted hydrothermal method. The obtained BFO-NP was hexagonal phase with R3c structure and covered with a large number of surface hydroxyl groups. Compared with the bulk BiFeO3 microsphere, BFO-NP has much higher purity and similar band gap energy, about 2.10 eV. The photocatalytic performance of BFO-NP was evaluated by Rhodamine B (RhB) removal without any sacrificial agent under visible-light irradiation. A fivefold increase in the rate of RhB degradation and mineralization was obtained, which should result from effective separation of the electron-hole pairs. Furthermore, the scavenger-experiments reveal that photo-generated holes and hydroxyl radicals were the primary reactive species. This study opens a new pathway to synthesize BiFeO3 nanoparticle by hydrothermal method and provides a referential route for other perovskite photocatalysts. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB ZnO/Ag composites were synthesized by photochemical deposition of Ag nanoparticles onto presynthesized three dimensional hierarchical cake-like ZnO microstructures, which were fabricated by DMF (N, N-dimethylformamide)-mediated solvothermal method. The crystal phase and microstructures of the as-obtained ZnO and ZnO/Ag were characterized by XRD, DRS, SEM, EDS, TEM and PL. The SEM and TEM results indicated that Ag nanodisks with diameters of 120 nm are uniformly deposited on the surface of hierarchical cake-like ZnO. Furthermore, the visible-light photocatalytic activity of the ZnO/Ag composites was evaluated by the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under Xe lamp irradiation. Such ZnO/Ag composites showed an enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity, the rate of degradation was nearly five times faster than that of bare hierarchical cake-like ZnO under visible-light irradiation due to the increase of electron-transfer rate of ZnO after hybridized with Ag nanoparticles.

The results show that the two kinds of fillers possess different wettability on the Ti2AlC ceramics: the contact angle of the nickel fillers decreases continuously with rising temperature and reaches less than 20 degrees finally, whereas that of the aluminum fillers remains larger than 135 degrees in the full temperature range investigated. The characterization of the interface from cross-section observations reveals the presence of an interaction layer in the Ti2AlC ceramic substrate, which promotes the wetting process.

AB This paper demonstrates the fabrication process of a porous metal using the direct energy deposition (DED) process, wherein Ti6Al4V powders mixed with a foaming agent (TiH2) were sprayed on the Ti6Al4V substrate, and subsequently, melted with the substrate using a high-power laser beam. Before the solidification of the molten metal, the hydrogen gas generated from TiH2 caused pores inside the deposited layer. The fabricated porous structures had porosities of 22% and 11% for laser powers of 900 and 1100 W, respectively, which indicated that the densities of the layered porous structures could be controlled by varying the process parameters. Finally, the compression testing of the samples proved that the porous structure fabricated by DED is significantly effective in absorbing mechanical energy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB We are reporting the effect of magnesium (Mg) addition into aluminum nitride (AlN) on piezoelectric and mechanical properties. Addition of 2.5 at.% Mg was found to slightly enhance both the piezoelectric constant (d(33)) (up to 7.4 pC/N) and the relative permittivity (up to 12). Young's modulus and hardness were decreased when 2.5 at.% Mg was added into AlN and were slightly increased for sample with 5 at.% Mg addition. The dielectric loss was less than 10 (2) for samples with Mg addition lower than 8 at.%. However, higher Mg addition (>8 at.%) led to a lower d(33), higher relativity permittivity while decreasing Young's modulus and hardness. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB At room temperature, tetragonal BiOI photocatalyst with surface heterojunction between (0 0 1) facets and (1 1 0) facets was prepared by controlling the amount of water in the hydrolysis process. The prepared samples with different proportions of (0 0 1) surface and (1 1 0) surface were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, HRTEM and UV-vis. The photocatalytic performance for the MO degradation under visible light can be attributed to the formation of interfacial heterojunction between the (0 0 1) surface and (1 1 0) surface, which promotes the separation of photoinduced electron and hole pairs on the interfaces.

AB This study focuses on incorporating multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) in nanoporous titanium dioxides (TiO2) thin film for enhancing the performance of hybrid poly(3-hexylthiophene)(P3HT)/TiO2 solar cells. MWNTs were successfully incorporated in the nanoporous TiO2 electrodes either by systematically blending or dipping prior to the deposition of P3HT. Current density-voltage (J-V) characteristic of the corresponding fabricated devices showed that the short-circuit current density (J(SC)) and fill factor are strongly influenced by the amount of MWNT incorporated into TiO2 nanoparticles. Solar cells with optimum amount of MWNT incorporated by blending in nanoporous TiO2 layer showed a factor of two efficiency enhancement, mainly due to improvement in J(SC) compared to the corresponding control device. Further increment in MWNT reduces the efficiency mainly due to a sharp drop in fill factor and V-OC, which can be attributed to shunting by excess amount of MWNTs. Devices with MWNT dip-coated TiO2 and polymer too showed enhanced efficiency over 2.5% under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm (2)), which is a factor of three higher than the corresponding control device.

AB Present work focuses on the growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) using nickel as a catalyst onto the silicon substrate through plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) method. As synthesised SWCNTs have been characterized by employing various analytical techniques like XRD, SEM, HR-TEM/EDS and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. The HRTEM micrographs revealed that the SWCNTs were mostly entangled bundles with diameters of about 2 nm. The optical absorption data were used to estimate energy bandgap of the SWCNTs and found to be 2.67 eV. The photocatalytic performance of the nanotubes was examined by the deterioration of an organic dye methylene blue (MB) under visible light irradiation. The observed results exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity of the nanotubes that may be due to the large surface defects, surface area and small energy bandgap characteristics of the nanotubes.

AB Leishmaniosis is, to date, considered the second most important emerging vector-borne protozoal disease in the world after malaria. The form of zoonotic visceral leishmaniosis found in the Mediterranean basin is caused by Leishmania infantum, and its life cycle includes the domestic dog and a phlebotomine sandfly vector. This complex epidemiological cycle and its high prevalence of subclinical infection, hinder the surveillance and control of L. infantum, and allows it to go unnoticed at the geographical endemicity limits of the parasite or in recently colonized areas. We, therefore, tested 102 wolves (Canis lupus) and 47 other wild carnivores in order to detect Leishmania DNA by means of PCR. Samples were collected from 2008 to 2014 in Asturias (northern Spain), a region considered non-endemic for the parasite. The results obtained provided valuable information regarding the prevalence of Leishmania in wild carnivores in Asturias and its geographic distribution in the region: an average prevalence of 33% for wolves and an overall prevalence of 40% for all the wild carnivores studied were reported, with a widespread presence of the parasite in the region and an apparent increase in its prevalence in wolves during the last decade. This suggests the usefulness of the wolf as a sentinel species for the detection and study of Leishmania in the field and confirms the value of wildlife sanitary surveillance programs for the detection and monitoring of hitherto disregarded diseases that affect domestic animals and humans.

AB Quantitative real-time PCR assays previously developed for the detection of Theileria equi and Babesia caballi, were combined in a single multiplex TaqMan qPCR platform for the simultaneous detection of both heamo-protozoan parasites in equids. The multiplex equine piroplasmosis (M-EP) qPCR assay was shown to be efficient and specific. The detection limit was determined to be 1.4 x 10(-4) % parasitized erythrocytes (PE) for T. equi and 2.8 x 10(-4) % PE for B. caballi. The effect of differential DNA concentrations on the outcome of the M-EP qPCR for each target species was also investigated. The data demonstrated that the assay could reliably detect both targets, over a range of at least 1000-fold difference in target concentrations, without loss of sensitivity. The assay was subsequently evaluated on 243 field samples collected from areas where limited tick control strategies were implemented. The IFAT detected circulating T. equi and B. caballi antibodies in 100% and 92% of the samples, respectively. The M-EP qPCR assay detected T. equi parasite DNA in 98% of the samples, while B. caballi could only be detected in 6% of the samples tested, confirming that B. caballi infections generally occur at extremely low parasitaemias that rarely exceed 1%. The developed M-EP qPCR assay therefore serves as a reliable tool for the rapid diagnosis and epidemiological survey of equine piroplasmosis.

AB Sulfide-modified nanoscale zero-valent iron (S/NZVI) has been considered as an efficient material to degrade trichloroethylene (TCE) in groundwater. However, some critical factors influencing the dechlorination of TCE by S/NZVI have not been investigated clearly. In this study, the effects of Fe/S molar ratio, initial pH, dissolved oxygen and particle aging on TCE dechlorination by S/NZVI (using dithionite as sulfidation reagent) were studied. Besides, the feasibility of reactivation of the aged-NZVI by sulfidation treatment was looked into. The results show that the Fe/S molar ratio and initial pH significantly influenced the TCE dechlorination, and a higher TCE dechlorination was observed at Fe/S molar ratio of similar to 60 under alkaline condition. Spectroscopic analyses demonstrate that the enhanced TCE dechlorination was associated with the presence of FeS on the surface of S/NZVI. Dissolved oxygen had little effect on TCE dechlorination by S/NZVI, revealing that the FeS layer could be able to alleviate the surface passivation of NZVI caused by oxidation. Aging of S/NZVI up to 10-20 d only slightly decreased the dechlorination efficiency of TCE. Although an obvious drop in dechorination efficiency was observed for the S/NZVI aged for 30 d, it still exhibited a higher reactivity than the bare NZVI. This indicates that sulfidation of NZVI did prolong its lifetime. Additionally, sulfidation treatment was used to reactivate the aged NZVI, and the results show that the reactivated NZVI even had higher reactivity than the fresh NZVI, suggesting that sulfidation treatment would be a promising method to reactivate the aged NZVI.

AB Considering the increasing identification of trace organic contaminants in natural aquatic environments, the removal of trace organic contaminants from water or wastewater discharge is an urgent task. Ultraviolet (UV) and UV-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), such as UV/hydrogen peroxide (UV/ H2O2), UV/free chlorine and UV/persulfate, are attractive and promising approaches for the removal of these contaminants due to the high reactivity of active radical species produced in these UV-AOPs with a wide variety of organic contaminants. However, the removal efficiency of trace contaminants is greatly affected by the presence of background dissolved organic matter (DOM). In this study, we use ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry to evaluate the transformation of a standard Suwanee River fulvic acid DOM isolate in UV photolysis and UV-AOPs. The use of probe compounds allows for the determination of the steady-state concentrations of active radical species in each UV-AOP. The changes in the H/C and O/C elemental ratios, double bond equivalents, and the low-molecular-weight transformation product concentrations of organic acids reveal that different DOM transformation patterns are induced by each UVAOP. By comparison with the known reactivities of each radical species with specific organic compounds, we mechanistically and systematically elucidate the molecular-level DOM transformation pathways induced by hydroxyl, chlorine, and sulfate radicals in UV-AOPs. We find that there is a distinct transformation in the aliphatic components of DOM due to HO center dot in UV/H2O2 and UV/free chlorine. Cl center dot induced transformation of olefinic species is also observed in the UV/free chlorine system. Transformation of aromatic and olefinic moieties by Sal - are the predominant pathways in the UV/persulfate system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phenol recovery from phenol-laden saline wastewater plays an important role in the waste reclamation and pollution control. A membrane aromatic recovery system-like membrane contactor (MARS-like membrane contactor) was set up in this study using electrospun polydimethylsiloxane/polymethyl methacrylate (PDMS/PMMA) membrane with 0.0048 m(2) effective area to separate phenol from saline wastewater. Phenol and water contact angles of 0 degrees and 162 degrees were achieved on this membrane surface simultaneously, indicating its potential in the separation of phenol and water-soluble salt. Feed solution (500 mL) of 0.90 IA and receiving solution (500 mL) of 1.26 L/h were investigated to be the optimum conditions for phenol separation, which corresponds to the employed Reynolds number of 14.6 and 20.5. During 108 h continuous separation for feed solution (2.0 phenol, 10.0 g/L NaCl) under room temperature (20 degrees C), 42.6% of phenol was recycled in receiving solution with a salt rejection of 99.95%. Meanwhile, the mean phenol mass transfer coefficient (K-ov) was 6.7 x 10(-7) m s(-1). As a membrane-based process, though the permeated phenol increased with the increase of phenol concentration in feed solution, the phenol recovery ratio was determined by the membrane properties rather than the pollutant concentrations. Phenol was found to permeate this membrane via adsorption, diffusion and desorption, and therefore, the membrane fouling generated from pore blockage in other membrane separation processes was totally avoided.

AB Sludge cell disruption was generally considered as the rate-limiting step for the anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge (WAS). Advanced oxidation processes and bio-electro-chemical systems were recently reported to enhance the hydrolysis of WAS and sludge cell disruption, while the cell-breaking processes of these systems remain unclear yet. In this study, an innovative Bio-electro-Fenton system was developed to pretreat the WAS sequentially with cathode Fenton process and anode anaerobic digestion. Significant cell disruption and dissolution intracellular organics were founded after the treatment. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra indicated that Gram-negative bacteria were more sensitive to free radicals yielded in cathode to induce a chain reaction that destroyed the lipid-contained outer membrane, while Gram-positive bacteria with thick peptidoglycan layer were liable to be biologically decomposed in the anode. Compared with the oxidation of organic matters in the cathode Fenton, the secretion of enzyme increased in the anode which was beneficial to break down the complex matters (peptidoglycans) into simples that were available for anode oxidation by exoelectrogens. The results also showed a possible prospect for the application of this sequential pretreatment in bio-electro-Fenton systems to disrupt sludge cells and enhance the anaerobic digestion.

AB Nutrient recovery performance utilising an electrodialysis (ED) process was quantified in a 30-cell pair pilot reactor with a 7.2 m(2) effective membrane area, utilising domestic anaerobic digester supernatant, which had been passed through a centrifuge as a feed source (centrate). A concentrated product (NH4-N 7100 +/- 300 mg/L and K 2490 +/- 40 mg/L) could be achieved by concentrating nutrient ions from the centrate wastewater dilute feed stream to the product stream using the ED process. The average total current efficiency for all major cations over the experimental period was 76 +/- 2% (NH4-N transport 40%, K transport 14%). The electrode power consumption was 4.9 +/- 1.5 kWh/kgN, averaged across the three replicate trials. This value is lower than competing technologies for NH4-N removal and production, and far lower than previous ED lab trials, demonstrating the importance of pilot testing. No significant variation in starting flux densities and cell resistance voltage for subsequent replicate treatments indicated effective cleaning procedures and operational sustainability at treatment durations of several days. This study demonstrates that ED is an economically promising technology for the recovery of nutrients from wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work investigated impacts of iodide (I-) on the transformation of the widely used phenolic preservative methylparaben (MeP) as well as 11 other phenolic compounds by potassium permanganate (KMnO4). It was found that KMnO4 showed a low reactivity towards MeP in the absence of I- with apparent second-order rate constants (k(app)) ranging from 0.065 +/- 0.0071 to 1.0 +/- 0.1 M-1 s(-1) over the pH range of 5-9. The presence of I- remarkably enhanced the transformation rates of MeP by KMnO4 via the contribution of hypoiodous acid (HOI) in situ formed, which displayed several orders of magnitude higher reactivity towards MeP than KMnO4. This enhancing effect of I- was greatly influenced by solution conditions (e.g., I- or KMnO4 concentration or pH), which could be well simulated by a kinetic model involving competition reactions (i.e., KMnO4 with I-, KMnO4 with MeP, HOI with KMnO4, and HOI with MeP). Similar enhancing effect of I- on the transformation kinetics of 5 other selected phenols (i.e., p-hydroxybenzoic acid, phenol, and bromophenols) at pH 7 was also observed, but not in the cases of bisphenol A, triclosan, 4-n-nonylphenol, and cresols. This discrepancy could be well explained by the relative reactivity of KMnO4 towards phenols vs I-. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis showed that iodinated aromatic products and/or iodinated quinone-like product were generated in the cases where I- enhancing effect was observed. Evolution of iodinated aromatic products generated from MeP (10 mu M) treated by KMnO4 (50-150 mu M) in the presence of I- (5-15 mu M) suggested that higher I- or moderate KMnO4 concentration or neutral pH promoted their formation. A similar enhancing effect of I- (1 mu M) on the transformation of MeP (1 mu M) by KMnO4 (12.6 mu M) and formation of iodinated aromatic products were also observed in natural water. This work demonstrates an important role of I- in the transformation kinetics and product formation of phenolic compounds by KMnO4, which has great implications for future applications of KMnO4 in treatment of I(-)containing water.

AB Stable dispersion of nanoparticles with environmentally-friendly materials is important for their various applications including environmental remediation. In this study, we systematically examined the mechanisms of stable dispersion of two types of TiO2 nanoparticles (TNPs) with anatase and rutile crystalline structures by naturally occurring dissolved organic matter (humic acid) at different pHs, including at, below and above the Point of Zero Charge (PZC). The results showed that stable dispersion of TNPs by humic acid (HA) at all pHs tested can only be achieved with the assistance of ultra-sonication. The dispersion of TNPs by HA differed at the three pHs tested. Generally, HA greatly decreased the hydrodynamic diameters of TNPs at a very low concentration. The dispersion of TNPs became relatively stable when the HA concentration exceeded 5 mg/L, indicating that this HA concentration is required for stable dispersion of TNPs. The mechanisms involved in dispersion of TNPs by HA included electrostatic repulsion, steric hindrance and hydrophobic interaction. Electrostatic repulsion was identified to be the dominant mechanism. The dispersion of TNPs was enhanced when HA was added before ultra-sonication to avoid the partly irreversible re-aggregation of TNPs after sonication. The crystalline phases and concentrations of TNPs were also found to influence their stable dispersion. The findings from this work enhance understanding of the combined effects of HA, pH, ultra-sonication and crystalline structures of TNPs on their stable dispersion. The mechanisms identified can improve applications of TNPs in environmental water pollution control. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Substituted chlorobenzenes are the basic substructure of many surface water contaminants. In this study, the isotope fractionation and reaction mechanisms involved during the aqueous direct and indirect photodegradation of CH3-, Cl-, and NO2- substituted chlorobenzenes were investigated in laboratory experiments. Only 4-nitrochlorobenzene showed slow but isotopically fractionating direct photolysis. During indirect photodegradation using UV/H2O2-generated OH radicals, the pseudo first-order reaction rate constants increased in the order of the NO2- < Cl- < CH3-substituted chlorobenzenes. The most pronounced carbon enrichment factors were observed for nitrochlorobenzenes (up to -4.8 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand), whereas the lowest were for chlorotoluenes (<= -1.0 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand). As the substituents became more electron-withdrawing, the activation energy barrier increased, leading to slower reaction rates, and the transition state changed to a more symmetrical or less reactant-like structure, resulting in larger apparent kinetic isotope effects. The results suggest that the rate-determining step in the reaction with OH radicals was the addition of the electrophile to the benzene ring. Even though further research is needed to quantify isotope fractionation during other transformation processes, these results showed evidence that compound specific isotope analysis can be used as a diagnostic tool for the fate of substituted chlorobenzenes in water.

AB The use of gadolinium-based contrasting agents (GBCA) is increasing because of the intensive usage of these agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Waste-water treatment does not reduce anthropogenic Gd-concentration significantly. Anomalous Gd-concentration in surface waters have been reported worldwide. However, removal of GBCA-s by aquatic macrophytes has still hardly been investigated. Four aquatic plant species (Lemna gibba, Ceratophyllum demersum, Elodea nuttallii, E. canadensis) were investigated as potential biological filters for removal of commonly used but structurally different GBCA-s (Omniscan, Dotarem) from water. These plant species are known to accumulate heavy metals and are used for removing pollutants in constructed wetlands. The Gd uptake and release of the plants was examined under laboratory conditions. Concentration-dependent infiltration of Gd into the body of the macrophytes was measured, however significant bioaccumulation was not observed. The tissue concentration of Gd reached its maximum value between day one and four in L. gibba and C. demersum, respectively, and its volume was significantly higher in C. demersum than in L gibba. In C. demersum, the open-chain ligand Omniscan causes two-times higher tissue Gd concentration than the macrocyclic ligand Dotarem. Gadolinium was released from Gd-treated duckweeds into the water as they were grown further in Gd-free nutrient solution. Tissue Gd concentration dropped by 50% in duckweed treated by Omniscan and by Dotarem within 1.9 and 2.9 days respectively. None of the macrophytes had a significant impact on the Gd concentration of water in low and medium concentration levels (1-256 mu g L-1). Biofiltration of GBCA-s by common macrophytes could not be detected in our experiments. Therefore it seems that in constructed wetlands, aquatic plants are not able to reduce the concentration of GBCA-s in the water. Furthermore there is a low risk that these plants cause the accumulation of anthropogenic Gd in the food chain. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sites of wastewater discharge are hotspots for pollution of freshwaters with organic micropollutants and are often associated with adverse effects to aquatic organisms. The assessment, monitoring and managment of these hotspots is challenged by variations in the pollutant mixture composition due to season, weather conditions and random spills. In this study, we unraveled temporal exposure patterns in organic micropollutant mixtures from wastewater discharge and analyzed respective acute and sublethal risks for aquatic organisms. Samples were taken from two components of a separate sewer system i) a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and ii) a rain sewer of a medium size town as well as from the receiving river in different seasons. Rain sewer samples were separately collected for rain and dry-weather conditions. We analyzed 149 compounds by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). By considering the pollution dynamics in the point sources, we reduced the complexity of pollutant mixtures by k-means clustering to a few emission groups representing temporal and weather-related pollution patterns. From these groups, we derived biological quality element (BQE) - specific risk patterns. In most cases, one main risk driving emission group and a few individual risk driving compounds were identified for each BQE. While acute risk for fish was quite low, algae were exposed to seasonally emitted herbicides (terbuthylazine, spiroxamine) and crustaceans to randomly spilled insecticides (diazinon, dimethoate). Sublethal risks for all BQE were strongly influenced by constantly emitted pollutants, above all, pharmaceuticals. Variability of risks in the river was mainly driven by water discharge of the river rather than by season or peak events. Overall, the studied WWTP represented the major pollution source with a specific emission of agricultural compounds. However, the investigated rain sewer showed to be a constant pollution source due to illicit connections and was an important entry route for high loads of insecticides and biocides due to spills or incorrect disposal. By considering these pollution and risk dynamics, monitoring strategies may be optimized with a special focus on times of low flow conditions in the river, rain events and seasonally emitted risk drivers.

AB Sulfate radical (SO4(center dot-))-induced oxidation is an important technology in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for the removal of pollutants. To date, few studies have assessed the effects of dissolved oxygen (DO) on the SO4 center dot(-)induced oxidation of organic micro-pollutants. In the present work, a quantum chemical calculation was used to investigate the influence of the external oxygen molecule on the Gibbs free energy (G(pollutant)) and HOMO-LUMO gap (Delta E) of 15 organic micro-pollutants representing four chemical categories. Several thermodynamic and statistical models were combined with the data from the quantum chemical calculation to illustrate the impact of DO on the oxidation of organic micropollutants by SO4(center dot-). Results indicated that the external oxygen molecule increased G(pollutant) of all studied chemicals, which implies DO has the potential to decrease the energy barrier of the SO4(center dot-)-induced oxidation and shift the chemical equilibrium of the reaction towards the side of products. From the perspective of kinetics, DO can accelerate the oxidation by decreasing Delta E of organic micro-pollutants. In addition, changes of G(pollutant) and Delta E of the SO4(center dot-)-induced oxidation were both significantly different between open-chain and aromatic chemicals, and these differences were partially attributed to the difference of polarizability of these two types of chemicals. Furthermore, we revealed that all changes of G(pollutant) and Delta E induced by DO were dependent on the DO content. Our study emphasizes the significance of DO on the oxidation of organic micro-pollutants by SO4(center dot-), and also provides a theoretical method to study the effect of components in wastewater on removal of organic pollutants in AOPs.

AB Waterborne human enteric viruses, such as noroviruses and adenoviruses, are excreted in the feces of infected individuals and transmitted via the fecal-oral route including contaminated food and water. Since viruses are normally present at low concentrations in aquatic environments, they should be concentrated into smaller volumes prior to downstream molecular biological applications, such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). This review describes recent progress made in the development of concentration and detection methods of human enteric viruses in water, and discusses their applications for providing a better understanding of the prevalence of the viruses in various types of water worldwide. Maximum concentrations of human enteric viruses in water that have been reported in previous studies are summarized to assess viral abundances in aquatic environments. Some descriptions are also available on recent applications of sequencing analyses used to determine the genetic diversity of viral genomes in water samples, including those of novel viruses. Furthermore, the importance and significance of utilizing appropriate process controls during viral analyses are discussed, and three types of process controls are considered: whole process controls, molecular process controls, and (reverse transcription (RT)-)qPCR controls. Although no standards have been established for acceptable values of virus recovery and/or extraction-(RT-)qPCR efficiency, use of at least one of these appropriate control types is highly recommended for more accurate interpretation of observed data.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is ubiquitous and plays an important role in regulating water quality, ecological function, and the fate and transport of trace elements and pollutants in aquatic environments. Both the colloidal precursors (i.e. <1 kDa) and bulk DOM collected from a freshwater estuary were incubated in the dark for 21 days to examine dynamic changes in molecular size and composition induced by microbial degradation and self-assembly. Results showed that the concentrations of total organic carbon, carbohydrates, and protein-like substances decreased by 11-30% during incubation, while those of humic- and fulvic-like substances remained relatively constant, indicating humic substances are more resistant to microbial utilization compared to carbohydrates and protein-like DOM. Despite the different extents in decline, these DOM components had a similar transformation pathway from the <1 kDa to colloids (1 kDa-0.45 Am) and further to microparticles (>0.45 mu m). Overall, carbohydrates and protein-like substances, especially the high molecular weight components, were preferentially decomposed by microorganisms whereas humic- and fulvic-like DOM components significantly coagulated through abiotic self-assembly. The contrasting degradation/transformation pathways between the humic-like and protein-like substances along the size continuum, as also characterized by flow field-flow fractionation analysis, demonstrated that the dynamic transformation and degradation of DOM is regulated by both molecular size and organic composition. This finding provides new insights into the biogeochemical cycling pathways of heterogeneous DOM and its environmental fate and ecological role in aquatic systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Solar-driven advanced oxidation processes were studied in a pilot-scale photoreactor, as tertiary treatments of effluents from an urban wastewater treatment plant. Solar-H2O2, heterogeneous photocatalysis (with and/or without the addition of H2O2 and employing three different photocatalysts) and the photo-Fenton process were investigated. Chemical (sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, and diclofenac) and biological contaminants (faecal contamination indicators, their antibiotic resistant counterparts, 16S rRNA and antibiotic resistance genes), as well as the whole bacterial community, were characterized. Heterogeneous photocatalysis using TiO2-P25 and assisted with H2O2 (P25/H2O2) was the most efficient process on the degradation of the chemical organic micropollutants, attaining levels below the limits of quantification in less than 4 h of treatment (corresponding to Q(UV) <40 kJ L-1). This performance was followed by the same process without H2O2, using TiO2-P25 or a composite material based on graphene oxide and TiO2. Regarding the biological indicators, total faecal coliforms and enterococci and their antibiotic resistant (tetracycline and ciprofloxacin) counterparts were reduced to values close, or beneath, the detection limit (1 CFU 100 mL(-1) ) for all treatments employing H2O2, even upon storage of the treated wastewater for 3-days. Moreover, P25/H2O2 and solar-H2O2 were the most efficient processes in the reduction of the abundance (gene copy number per volume of wastewater) of the analysed genes. However, this reduction was transient for 16S rRNA, int1 and sul1 genes, since after 3-days storage of the treated wastewater their abundance increased to values close to pre-treatment levels. Similar behaviour was observed for the genes qnrS (using TiO2 -P25), blac(CTX-M) and bla(TEM) (using TiO2-P25 and TiO2-P25/H2O2). Interestingly, higher proportions of sequence reads affiliated to the phylum Proteobacteria (Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria) were found after 3-days storage of treated wastewater than before its treatment.

AB Microbial community structure in the ozone-biofiltration systems of two drinking water and two wastewater treatment facilities was characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Collectively, these datasets enabled comparisons by facility, water type (drinking water, wastewater), pre-oxidation (ozonation, chlorination), media type (anthracite, activated carbon), media depth, and backwash dynamics. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in drinking water filters, whereas Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Planctomycetes were differentially abundant in wastewater filters. A positive correlation was observed between media depth and relative abundance of Cyanobacteria in drinking water filters, but there was only a slight increase in one alpha diversity metric with depth in the wastewater filters. Media type had a significant effect on beta but not alpha diversity in drinking water and wastewater filters. Pre-ozonation caused a significant decrease in alpha diversity in the wastewater filters, but the effect on beta diversity was not statistically significant. An evaluation of backwash dynamics resulted in two notable observations: (1) endosymbionts such as Neochlamydia and Legionella increased in relative abundance following backwashing and (2) nitrogen-fixing Bradyrhizobium dominated the microbial community in wastewater filters operated with infrequent backwashing. Bradyrhizobium is known to generate extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which may adversely impact biofilter performance and effluent water quality. These findings have important implications for public health and the operation and resiliency of biofiltration systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sidestream granular activated sludge grown on anaerobic digester dewatering centrate was bio-augmented and selectively retained to enable high nitrification performance of a 2.5-day aerobic SRT non-nitrifying flocculent activated sludge system at 12 degrees C. Sidestream-grown granules performed enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) and shortcut nitrogen removal via nitrite. After bio-augmentation, EBPR continued in the mainstream but ammonia oxidation was eventually to nitrate. Low effluent NH3-N concentrations from 0.6 to 1.7 mg/L were achieved with nitrification solely by granules, thus enabling denitrification and nitrogen removal. Molecular microbial analyses of flocs and granules also suggested that nitrifying organisms persisted on granules with minimal nitrifier loss to flocs. Mainstream granule mass at the end of bioaugmentation testing was 1.7 times the amount of sidestream granules added, indicating mainstream granular growth. Nitrite and nitrate availability during the unaerated feeding period encouraged significant growth of ordinary heterotrophs in mainstream granules, but nevertheless mainstream nitrification capacity was sustained.

AB Continuous gas recirculation (CGR) was demonstrated in this study to be an effective method to mitigate the persistent problem of sludge flotation in high-rate sulfate-reducing upflow sludge bed (SRUSB) reactors that do not produce much gas. The effects of hydraulic- and CGR-mixing on the mixing regime of the SRUSB reactors were investigated over a period of 45 d at the average shear rates of 0.9, 1.5, 2.7, 4.2 and 7.2 s(-1) (Phase 1). CGR-mixing at 4.2 s(-1) resulted in the smallest reactor short-circuiting flow of 1.3 +/- 0.1% and the smallest dead zone volume of 0.2 +/- 0.01% at a lower power consumption (0.0007 W) than hydraulic mixing. In Phase II, the SRUSB reactor with CGR-mixing at 4.2 s(-1) was re-inoculated and operated for 150 days. Within the first 65 days, the sludge transformed into micro-granules (300-350 mu m) with a high sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) activity (0.62 +/- 0.05 g COD/(g MLVSS.day)), a low sludge flotation potential (<20%) and a high settleability (SVI5/SVI30 < 1.3). These results are attributed to the following sludge properties: (i) a low ratio of loosely-bound to tightly-bound extracellular polymeric substances (0.06-0.1), (ii) weakly adhesive surface properties as demonstrated by a strongly negative zeta potential (-23 +/- 2 mV), a low hydrophobicity (37 +/- 3%) and a low viscosity (0.7 +/- 0.1 mPa s), and (iii) small size granules resulting in strong mass transfer (sulfate and COD penetration into the granule core) and a homogeneous structure (SRB detected throughout the granule).

AB Being cost-effective, synthetic materials were initially used abundantly for the removal of oil. Gradually, however, awareness of the use of dispersants like Corexit, which makes water resources more toxic than oil, has changed the scenario for the treatment of spilled oil. The removal of spilled oil from water resources is still a very topical issue. An eco-friendly and sustainable approach towards the environment has introduced many low-cost, non-toxic and biodegradable materials along with different biomasses to make micro-to nano-sized materials, membranes, sponges/aerogel, etc. for the removal and recovery of oil from water resources. Additionally, the reusability of these materials after the recovery of oils has added one more step towards sustainability. This review comprises the work conducted by various researchers in the field of the removal and recovery of spilled oils using various biomasses and polymers, either in the form of sorbents or separators.

AB The performance of a pilot-scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) for treating antibiotic solvent wastewater under different cross flow velocities (CFV) was investigated. Effects of mixed liquid suspended solids (MLSS), colloid total organic carbon (TOC) and CFV on membrane fouling rate (R-MF ) were also explored in this paper. Throughout 341 days of experiment, the average total removal rate of N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) was 98.5% which hardly affected by the variation of CFV, and the compliance rate of DMF was 92% according to the Chinese standard (<25 mg/L). However, the relevant high total removal rate of M-cresol (MC) was achieved as 97.5%, the content of effluent failed to meet the national level emission standard (<0.1 mg/L). The biogas yield and the methane content of the biogas increased gradually with the increase of CFV, and the average methane content were over 70%. There were four kinds of methanogens in AnMBR, Methanosaeta spp was the largest methanogenic community, with an area of 45-70% of the archae. There was a linear relationship between colloid TOC and R-MF at different MLSS concentrations. Then a universal mathematical model for the changes of R-MF with influence factors was established. The result showed that model well fitted the laboratory data. It is suggested that the model proposed could reflect and manage the membrane fouling of AnMBR treating antibiotic solvent wastewater.

AB Water utilities worldwide spend annually billions of dollars to control sulfide-induced corrosion in sewers. Iron salts chemically oxidize and/or precipitate dissolved sulfide in sewage and are especially used in medium-and large-size sewers. Iron salt dosing rates are defined ad hoc, ignoring variation in sewage flows and sulfide levels. This often results in iron overdosing or poor sulfide control. Online dosing control can adjust the chemical dosing rates to current (and future) state of the sewer system, allowing high-precision, stable and cost-effective sulfide control. In this paper, we report a novel and robust online control strategy for the dosing of ferrous salt in sewers. The control considers the fluctuation of sewage flow, pH, sulfide levels and also the perturbation from rainfall. Sulfide production in the pipe is predicted using auto-regressive models (AR) based on current flow measurements, which in turn can be used to determine the dose of ferrous salt required for cost-effective sulfide control. Following comprehensive model-based assesment, the control was successfully validated and its effectiveness demonstrated in a 3-week field trial. The online control algorithm controlled sulfide below the target level (0.5 mg S/L) while reducing chemical dosing up to 30%. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent research on contaminant removal by zerovalent iron (ZVI) has evolved from investigating simple model systems to systems that encompass increased dimensions of complexity. Sulfidation and aerobic conditions are two of the most broadly relevant complications. Combining these two, this study investigated the dynamic interactions between sulfidated microscale ZVI and dissolved O-2, for removal of Cr(VI), a model contaminant for metals and metalloids. The results show that the coupling of sulfidation and oxygenation significantly improves Cr removal, which is attributed to enhanced Fe(II) production that resulted from accelerated corrosion of Fe(0). The Cr(VI) removal rate increased with increasing O-2 saturation from 0% to 100% but showed a bimodal dependence on the S/Fe ratio. At the optimal S/Fe ratio, the ZVI exhibits a highly porous surface morphology, which, according to prior literature on sulfur induced corrosion, promotes corrosion. In addition, a novel time series correlation was developed between aqueous Fe(II) and Cr(VI) based on data collected in the presence and absence of 1,10-phenanthroline, to probe for changes of reductants during the reaction time course. The analysis indicated that Fe(0) was responsible for the initial small amount of Cr(VI) removal, which then transitioned to a phase controlled by surface Fe(II). The slopes of the time series correlations during the latter phase of the reaction vary with experimental conditions but are mostly much higher than the theoretical stoichiometric ratio between Cr(VI) and Fe(II) (i.e., 0.33), indicating that Fe(II) regeneration contributes significantly to Cr removal.

AB Data on several infections of sheep and goats, including parasite infections, are routinely collected during inspection of harvested rangeland goats after slaughter. This is an important role of the Australian National Sheep Health Monitoring Program (NSHMP). Our study investigated the presence of metacestodes of Taenia hydatigena, T. ovis and Echinococcus granulosus in slaughtered goats from Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia. During the period of the study (2007-2013) 374,580 goats were slaughtered and inspected by trained abattoir meat inspectors as part of the NSHMP. Taenia hydatigena was found most commonly, followed by T. ovis. Despite one probable false positive, the surveyed population of goats was demonstrated to be free of infection by E. granulosus at a design prevalence of 0.1%. In areas where goats, foxes and wild dogs (dingoes [Canis lupus dingo] and dingo/domestic dog [Canis lupus] hybrids) co-exist they could be perpetuating the transmission of T. hydatigena and T. ovis as a wildlife reservoir. Rangeland goats do not appear to be an intermediate host for E. granulosus. Despite having similar lifecycles, T. hydatigena and T. ovis appeared to occur with different geographical patterns. This is the first time rangeland goats have been investigated for infection with taeniid metacestodes in such large numbers and over a wide geographical area.

AB Factors affecting the development of Ascaridia galli specific humoral responses and their protective roles are largely unknown. We investigated the effects of time and infection dose on A. galli specific IgY antibody levels following experimental infection. The acquisition and development of new infections and reinfections were also monitored by using tracer birds. Relationships between the retrospective IgY and the final worm burden of the birds were investigated to determine whether humoral immune responses generated during infection provide protection to the host animal.
   Young chickens were infected (+) with either 100 or 1000 embryonated eggs of A. galli (100+:n = 45; 1000 + n = 45) or kept as uninfected controls (CON: n = 10). Uninfected birds were also added to each infection group as tracer (T) birds (T100 +; n = 5 and T1000 +; n = 5). Faecal egg counts and IgY antibody concentrations in plasma and egg yolk were determined at selected intervals. Final worm burdens were quantified at 28 weeks post infection (wpi).
   The plasma antibody (PAB) and egg yolk antibody (EAB) levels of experimentally infected birds were compared to those of control and tracer birds throughout the study period, and PAB levels were found to depend initially on the infection dose but thereafter mainly on reinfections. Starting at wpi 2, 1000+ had consistently higher PAB levels than CON did (P < 0.05). With exceptions at wpi 0, 2 and 12, PAB levels were also higher (P < 0.05) or tended to be higher (P < 0.10) in 100 + than in CON. An earlier and higher increase was observed in the PAB levels of T1000 + than in those of T100 +, implying that (re-)infection occurrence depended on the infection dose. Although 1000 + showed higher (P < 0.05) EAB levels than CON did at both wpi 14 and 18, EAB levels were higher in 100+ than in CON only at wpi 28 (P < 0.05). The total worm burdens in the initial experimentally infected birds were similar (P = 0.257); they were also highly comparable between experimentally and naturally infected birds, indicating that final worm burden was mainly determined by the naturally occurring infections resulting from continuous exposure. When all available information on the retrospective plasma and egg yolk IgY levels was collectively evaluated to estimate the larval or total worm burdens of the experimentally infected birds, both PAB and EAB levels at particular wpi were significantly associated with worm burden, especially with larval count. In conclusion, our data support the hypothesis that the number of larvae, rather than the number of mature worms, affects the antibody levels in both plasma and egg yolk. Despite the increased levels of A. galli specific antibodies in plasma and egg yolk throughout the study period, only a weak indication was found that antibodies might be directly associated with protection.

AB Habronemosis is a common parasitic disease of horses worldwide. In order to investigate how haptoglobin (Hp), serum amyloid A (SAA), oxidative stress markers, nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), varies in cutaneous habronemosis, 30 horses with the clinical disease and 20 clinically healthy horses were included in the current study. The serum levels of Hp, SAA, and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha), NO, malondialdehyde (MDA), super oxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were determined in horses before and after two weeks of treatment. The serum levels of Hp, SAA, IL-6, TNF-alpha and MDA were significantly elevated in infected horses as compared to the controls. Alternately, the serum levels of SOD, GSH, TAC and NO, were recorded low in infected horses as compared to the controls. All tested markers resumed the same levels after treatment as in control group. The Hp, SAA, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and MDA exhibited a high degree of clinical accuracy of the cases diagnosis. The area under the curve (AUC) for acute phase proteins (SAA, Hp), IL-6, TNF-alpha, and MDA was 0.87, 0.94, 0.96, 0.96 and 1.0, respectively. These findings showed that Hp, SAA, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and MDA may be supportive in the diagnosis of cutaneous habronemosis in horses and, simultaneously, they can also be used to monitor the progress of the treatment.

AB Vaccines against Tritrichomonas foetus have been shown to reduce the time of infection after natural or experimental exposure. The object of this study was to assess the protection against T. foetus infection conferred by a single vaginal instillation of formaldehyde fixed T. foetus cells. Aberdeen Angus virgin heifers were randomly allocated to 3 groups of 12 individuals to receive placebo or formaldehyde fixed T. foetus cells prepared following one of two procedures (formalin or freshly prepared solution) and six weeks later they were challenged with 106 T. foetus trophozoites. The median time for clearance among control heifers was 93.75 days while in animals immunized with formaldehyde fixed T. foetus it was 45 days. A single vaginal dose of cells fixed with fresh formaldehyde solution gave a rate of decay of infection per unit of time of 2.54 (CI 95% = 1.07;6.01).

Two storage media for parasite eggs were used; faeces or water. Eggs in petri dishes (90 dishes in total) containing faces or water media were first exposed either to aerobic or anaerobic conditions at different temperatures (4 degrees C / + O-2, 4 degrees C / -O-2, 25 degrees C / -O-2) for a maximum of 72 days. Every second week, materials from petri dishes in triplicates were recovered and incubated aerobically for two weeks at 25 degrees C. After the incubation, 200-300 eggs from each petri shish (sampling unit) were counted and the number of embryonated eggs was determined. Data was analyzed in R (version 3.4.3) A logistic regression model with the probability of an egg to embryonate as dependent variable and conditions, storage medium and time points as fixed effects with quasibinomial distribution was run. Least-square means were calculated and pairwise comparisons were made with the fixed effect factors (condition, storage medium and time point). Eggs in faeces had a significantly (p < 0.05) higher embryonation than those in water, irrespective of storage conditions. At 4 degrees C embryonation tended to decline over time under aerobic conditions irrespective of the storage medium, whereas it remained constant following storage at anaerobic conditions. In contrast, anaerobic storage at the 25 degrees C negatively affected egg development in both media, except for day 14 in faeces. Our major finding was that eggs in faeces under anaerobic conditions and at 4 degrees C retained the highest rate of development, with a minimum decline in their developmental capacity over time compared to cleaned eggs stored in water.

AB Infections with Eimeria spp. are common in pigs worldwide, occasionally affecting animals clinically after weaning or during the fattening period when diarrhoea and weight loss can be observed upon infection with the more pathogenic species. Molecular characterization of pathogens is valuable to accurately delimit species and development novel diagnostics, although sequences which define Eimeria species that infect pigs are scarce. Only three of the eight common species are currently represented in GenBank. In this study we describe the occurrence of Eimeria species in pigs sampled in Punjab, India; going on to use the samples to generate new species specific 18S rDNA sequences for all of the previously uncharacterised species. Using these data we report the first phylogenetic analyses to include the eight Eimeria species that commonly infect the domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus). Consideration of phylogenetic trees produced using Maximum Likelihood, Neighbour Joining, Maximum Parsimony and Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean methods indicate that the 18S rDNA sequences present lower levels of genetic diversity than Eimeria which infect avian species and are insufficient to infer stable phylogenies.

AB Cystic echinococcosis is endemic both in livestock and humans in many parts of Kenya. However, very little data exists on Echinococcus infections in dogs, and therefore their role in maintaining the transmission cycles and environmental contamination with eggs of Echinococcus species is unknown. The study aimed to establish the prevalence and distribution of Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato causing infection in dogs in Kenya. A total of 1621 dog faecal samples were collected from the environment in four different regions and examined microscopically for the presence of taeniid eggs. Up to 20 individual taeniid eggs per faecal sample were picked, lysed and genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and sequencing of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (nad1) gene. Eleven percent (178/1621) of faecal samples had taeniid eggs, while 4.4% (71/1621) contained Echinococcus spp. eggs. Area-wise, the faecal prevalence of Echinococcus spp. was 9.2% (48/524) in Turkana, 4.0% (20/500) in Maasai Mara, 0.7% (2/294) in Isiolo and 0.3% (1/303) in Meru. E. granulosus sensu stricto (s. s.) was the dominant Echinococcus taxon, followed by E. canadensis (G6/7) that was detected in 51 and 23 faecal samples, respectively. E. ortleppi was detected in only 5 faecal samples. We report for the first time the presence of E. felidis eggs in two dog faecal samples (from Maasai Mara region). Mixed infections of these taxa were also found in faecal samples, including: E. granulosus s. s. and E. canadensis (G6/7) (n = 7), E. granulosus s. s. and E. ortleppi (n = 1) and all three species (n = 1). The dog data presented here confirm the differences in diversity and abundance of Echinococcus spp. between regions of Kenya, correspond well with previously published data from livestock, and tentatively suggest a role of domestic dogs as a link between domestic and sylvatic cycles of Echinococcus spp.

AB Neospora caninum is an apicomplexan protozoan responsible for abortion in ruminants. The present study aimed to diagnose an abortion from an Anglo Nubian goat from a dairy herd located in Buenos Aires province, Argentina. The goat delivered a fetus of approximately 3 months gestation that was studied by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), Immunoblot (IB), histopathology (HP), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and molecular assays (PCR, sequencing and microsatellite genotyping). Interferon gamma knock-out mice were inoculated with a pool of tissues for isolation attempts. The mother had IFAT titers of 1:3200 and 1:400 for N. caninum and Toxoplasma gondii, respectively, as well as positive IB reactions, whereas the fetus was seronegative to both parasites by IFAT and IB. The fetus had severe multifocal necrotizing myocarditis and hepatitis, moderate interstitial pneumonia, and nephritis. Myocardium sample resulted positive by IHC, evidencing clusters of N. caninum tachyzoites within myocardiocytes associated with histopathological lesions. Neospora caninum-DNA was detected by PCR in heart, liver, lungs, kidney, and muscle from the fetus, and was negative for T. gondii by PCR. NC-5 and 18 S rRNA gene fragment sequences showed 100% identity with N. caninum. Inoculated mice bled 30 days post-inoculation resulted seronegative to N. caninum and T. gondii by IFAT, and showed no clinical signs. Multilocus-microsatellite genotyping revealed a genetic profile that differed from previously reported N. caninum genotypes, with unique MS21 and MS10 alleles. These findings indicate that N. caninum was efficiently transmitted from the mother to the fetus. We report the first case of direct detection of N. caninum in a goat fetus in Argentina and N. caninum microsatellite genotyping in naturally infected goat.

AB The utility of therapeutic vaccination of bulls against Tritrichomonas foetus has been advocated in previous studies, but anecdotal reports suggest this practice does not clear infections and may additionally confound diagnostic testing by reducing parasite burdens below detectable limits. The objective of this study was to characterize the systemic humoral immune response to therapeutic vaccination in T. foetus-infected bulls over a period of four months using an indirect ELISA and to compare the dynamics of this response to culture and PCR results to establish the existence of a relationship (or lack thereof) between immunization and infection status. A study population of 4- to 6-year-old T. foetus-infected beef bulls (n = 20) was divided equally into a treatment group and a control group. The treatment group received two doses of commercially prepared whole cell killed vaccine 2 weeks apart while the control group received injections of vaccine diluent. Blood samples were collected at each injection and at 4 subsequent dates every 4 weeks thereafter (i.e. 0, 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18 wks) to measure IgG(1) and IgG(2) antibody subisotype response via an indirect ELISA. Preputial smegma samples were collected at the four monthly intervals following vaccination for diagnosis of infection via InPouch (TM) culture, Modified Diamond's Medium (MDM) culture, and PCR. Humoral response for both IgG isotypes from week 2 through week 18 were significantly increased in vaccinates compared to controls. No significant decrease in infection prevalence was detected in the treatment group for any of the diagnostic methods used. The apparent lack of pathogen clearance during a stimulated immune response suggests that therapeutic vaccination may not be a useful T. foetus management practice.

AB A two-year-old cat from Tenerife, Canary Islands (Spain), presented with two months history of uveitis in the left eye. It had been treated for two months but still showed an active uveitis. After new treatment, eye examination showed a mobile worm in the anterior chamber. Following surgical removal, the worm was obtained. Morphological study revealed that it was a male metastrongyloid nematode (Nematoda: Metastrongyloidea) with caudal bursa and two similar spicules. Molecular tools based on the 18Sr RNA gene sequence identified the parasite as Gurltia paralysans, which is a neurotropic nematode previously found in South America. Therefore, this article describes the first report of ophthalmic case of parasitism by G. paralysans, and cites for first time this species out of South America.

AB In recent years, genetically encoded fluorescent probes have allowed a dramatic advancement in time-lapse imaging, enabling this imaging modality to be used to investigate intracellular events in several apicomplexan parasite species. In this study, we constructed a plasmid vector to stably express a genetically encoded H2O2 sensor probe called HyPer in Babesia bovis. The HyPer-transfected parasite population was successfully developed and subjected to a time-lapse imaging analysis under in vitro culture conditions. HyPer was capable of sensing an increasing H2O2 concentration in the parasite cells which was induced by the administration of paraquat as a superoxide donor. HyPer fluorescence co-staining with MitoTracker Red indicated the mitochondria as the major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in parasite cells. The fluctuating ROS dynamics in the parasite gliding toward, attaching to, and invading the target red blood cell was visualized and monitored in real time with the HyPer expressing parasite population. This is the first report to describe the application of the HyPer probe in an imaging analysis involving Babesia parasites. Hyper-expressing parasites can be widely utilized in studies to investigate the mechanisms of emergence and the reduction of oxidative stress, as well as the signal transduction in the parasite cells during host invasion and intercellular development.

AB Experimental results and published literature data regarding the development, survival and herbage translocation of Cooperia oncophora larvae were used to develop a climate-driven model to simulate the dynamics of the free-living stages. From daily maximum and minimum temperature the model estimated hourly development and survival rates of the pre-infective stages and daily survival of infective third stage larvae (L3) inside the faecal pat and in the herbage. In addition, daily rainfall data were used to calculate the translocation rate of the L3 from the faecal pat into the herbage. The model produced results for the development and survival of the free-living stages that were comparable to previous observations. Temperatures below 6 degrees C or above 35 degrees C resulted in a low estimate of developed L3, which in between increased and peaked at an optimal temperature estimate of 25.6 degrees C. Provided sufficient rainfall the model predicted that the developed L3 would be able to translocate from the faecal pat into the herbage. When validating model output for the herbage contamination with C. oncophora infective stage larvae against results of a two year field experiment, the comparison indicated that the model was able to reproduce the observed contamination pattern. Further, detailed examination of different model components helped to identify possible factors causing the decay of larval herbage contamination during winter spring as occurred in the field experiment.

AB Most animal research is less evidence-based for females, with the majority of studies conducted on males. Since immune responses vary between males and females, sexual dimorphism in immunity contributes, among other things, to sex-based differences post-vaccination. However, the issue of sex effects in animal vaccine research is rarely considered in vaccine study design. Previously, we have evaluated the efficacy of cathepsin L3 (FhCL3-1 and FhCL3-2) and B3 proteases (FhCB3) from juvenile Fasciola hepatica as vaccines against fasciolosis in male rats. Their administration resulted in reductions in liver fluke recovery in the range of 47-63% when compared with an infection control group. Here, we investigated if the protective effect of vaccination with these proteins can also be observed for female rats. The data indicates females were not protected from F. hepatica infection when vaccinated with juvenile cathepsins. Only in the FhCL3-2 vaccinated group was a low, non-significant, reduction in worm burden observed (21%). Although liver fluke mean body lengths and wet weights were reduced in vaccinated animals when compared with the infection controls, these effects were adjuvant- not vaccine-induced, while for males changes in these parameters were related primarily to vaccination. Specific humoral responses throughout the study were evident; however, trends in antibody responses in females replicated trends observed previously for male humoral responses. Formerly, elevated levels of FhCL3-1 and FhCL3-2 specific IgG1 and IgG2a were suggested to be correlated with protection. Here, despite increased and clear responses of these antibodies, protection was not observed. Hence, in the present study the roles of IgG1 and IgG2 in liver fluke reduction are questionable. Results demonstrated in our study show that observations obtained in one sex are not always applicable to the other sex. Hopefully, the findings of the study will stimulate discussion of the issue of sex impacts on post-vaccination outcomes and will encourage researchers to consider sex in their future vaccine studies.

AB Systemic isosporosis, also called atoxoplasmosis or visceral coccidiosis, is a disease that affects birds in general. Pathogenesis of systemic isosporosis and its etiologic agent have not been well characterized, but taxonomically Atoxoplasma is currently considered a junior objective synonym of Isospora. The present report aimed to describe pathological and molecular findings of systemic isosporosis in captive green-winged saltators (Saltator similis) from the State of Espirito Santo, Brazil. In a commercial breeding facility eleven birds with two to nine months of age died from 2015 to 2016. These birds developed nonspecific clinical signs, including bristly feathers, hyporexia, loss of weight, and apathy. Two birds were necropsied, and grossly there were hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, necrosis of lymphoid follicles, hepatic necrosis, and severe enteritis. Merozoites were observed in the heart, small intestine, proventriculus, brain, liver, spleen, and kidneys. 23 S RNA PCR amplicons from DNA extracted from the liver and the intestinal contents had 99% identity with Atoxoplasma sp., whereas amplicons of mitochondria] cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 ha d 97% identity with Isospora greineri. In conclusion, this report indicates that systemic isosporosis in green-winged saltator is a disease that affects the spleen, liver, and small intestine, with high mortality for young birds, resulting in significant loses to commercial breeding facilities.

AB Medicinal plants have been proposed as an alternative for acaricide control, aiming to develop lower-cost and eco-friendly ectoparasiticide products. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of the extracts and fractions obtained from the leaves of Digitaria insularis on the reproductive efficacy of the bovine tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus. Also, we investigated the possible relation with the anticholinesterase mechanism. The effect of the crude hydroethanolic (CH), hexanic (HE), ethyl acetate (EA), butanolic (BT) and residual hydroethanolic (RH) extracts, as well as four fractions of HE, were evaluated using adult immersion test. Only the HE and EA extracts (50 mg/mL) and fraction 2 (Fr2) (12.5 mg/mL) promoted reduction of the reproductive parameters (oviposition and hatching rate) greater than 90% and were not statistically different from the positive control. Higher reproductive activity was recorded in Fr2 with a lower effective concentration (EC50) value (6.65 mg/mL) than in HE (17.8 mg/mL) and EA (23.97 mg/mL). The anticholinesterase activity was assessed through spectrophotometry in microtiter assays, with enzymatic inhibition of 34.8, 43.2 and 57.9% of the HE, AE and Fr2, respectively. The chemical evaluation of the Fr2 was carried through Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (GC MS) and led to the characterization of nine compounds classified as fatty acids (3), esterified fatty acids with long-chain alcohol (4) and terpene (1). The effect of D. insularis extracts and fractions was focused on female reproductive parameters such as oviposition and hatching rates. The results obtained in this study suggest that D. insularis shows an in vitro acaricidal activity against R. (B.) microplus. Such action might be associated with the presence of secondary metabolites identified in the Fr2.

AB Tegumental proteins (TegPs) are a group of proteins that coat on the surface of worms, mainly being involved in ion uptake and immune evasion. Echinococcus species have many TegPs, but none of them have been characterized and their role remains unclear. The genome-wide analysis revealed that there were at least 14 tegp genes (tegpl - 14) in Echinococcus species, the majority of which were found to contain an EF-hand domain or a dynein light chain-like domain or both. Despite low identity, all TegP11 proteins from 25 flatworms were conserved in structure. Echinococcus multilocularis TegP11 (emu-TegP11) was verified to be secreted by extra cellular vesicles and to be localized in different spatiotemporal patterns in protoscoleces. Moreover, emu-TegP11 was also shown to have weak or no Ca2+-binding capacity. In treated macrophages, emu-TegP11 interfered with the small RNA-induced silencing pathway via inducing ectopic expression of some key component genes. Additionally, emu-TegP11 remarkably promoted NO secretion possibly by upregulation of inos gene expression (p < 0.05). It was further shown that emu-TegP11 acted as a suppressor of inflammation, with il-12B and il-1 beta being significantly down-regulated (p < 0.01), and il-10 and il-4 being significantly upregulated (p < 0.05). The study demonstrates a regulatory role of emu-TegP11, likely acting as a immunomodulator to be involved in regulation of host immune system during Echinococcus infection.

AB Last years have been characterized by a worldwide increasing attention towards the reduction of fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. Several industrial fields, as well as the civil and residential sector, have introduced innovative approaches for the design and the operation of energy systems. These actions are aimed to reach higher values of energy conversion efficiency, also including an increase in the use of renewable resources. In this context, especially in the sector of cruise ships, further efforts are required to improve the energy efficiency of the employed energy systems. The aim of this paper is to propose an optimization framework based on genetic algorithms in order to maximize the energy efficiency and minimize both the fuel consumption and the thermal energy dissipation, by optimizing the load allocation of the ship energy systems. To this purpose, different strategies for the energy systems on board of an existing cruise ship are proposed and analyzed. In particular, two main engines configurations have been defined: standard (current logic of operation maintained) and hybrid configuration. For each proposed strategy - being the ship a particular and interesting application of isolated energy grid (i.e. a grid without connections with electric and fuel national grids) - an in-house-developed software has been adapted and applied to optimize the load allocation of the various energy systems. Furthermore, an economic and environmental analysis has been carried out, in order to point out the benefits or the eventual limits - related to the proposed solutions. The considered approach is based on the concept of introducing economically and structurally suitable modifications to the current cruise energy systems configuration, in order to reach the goal of increasing the energy efficiency. The carried out analysis shows that the hybrid strategies allow to reach the best results in terms of energy (fuel consumption and heat dissipation reduction), economic and environmental points of view.

AB The transesterification activity of several solid base catalysts in biodiesel production was systematically studied and evaluated at room temperature. Commercialized calcined silicates showed stronger transesterification ability than other commonly-used oxides, and provided considerable biodiesel yields. Biodiesel yield of > 96% was obtained for Na2SiO3 catalyst (calcined at 400 degrees C) at 28 degrees C within 12 h with methanol/oil molar ratio of 12/1 and catalyst dosage of 5 wt%, and for CaSiO3 catalyst (calcined at 550 degrees C) at 28 degrees C within 24 h with methanol/oil molar ratio of 27/1 and catalyst dosage of 23 wt%. The high activity of Na2SiO3 came from low activation energy of 104.6 kJ/mol and considerable higher pre-exponential factor of 3.73 x 10(15) min(-1), which produced high turnover frequency of 0.234 min(-1) at 28 degrees C. The introduction of CA-O-Si structure in CaSiO3 resulted in high surface basicity of 0.70 mmol/g and high pre-exponential factor of 3.79 x 10(19) min(-1) but high activation energy of 136.4 kJ/mol. The loss of catalyst activity was mainly due to the variation of surface silicate structure during transesterification.

AB A hybrid ground source heat pump system employing the super-long flexible heat pipes to extract heat from ground is proposed in this work. To evaluate its energy performance and the temperature recovery characteristics near boreholes during space heating season, a comprehensive simulation model was developed considering the dynamic performance of heat pump and the heat transfer of heat pipes and surrounded soil. The results show that the depth of boreholes should be not less 70 m to guarantee a higher long-term energy efficiency. The seasonal coefficient of performance increases with increasing groundwater advection velocity and decreasing building load, with a maximum value up to 4.2 under examined conditions. The short-term variations of ground temperature near boreholes are sensitive to the borehole depth and building load. The overall ground temperature continuously decreases under the condition with no groundwater advection throughout the heating season, but with the presence of groundwater advection, the variation tendency would almost level out after several days of decrease. In addition, it is also revealed that this system has a potential to reduce the ratio of the electrical consumption of circulation pumps to the total consumption, with a reduction of about 7%, showing an advantage of saving energy over the traditional ground-source heat pumps.

AB The aim of this paper is to investigate the application of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) as the prime mover of a combined heat and power (CHP) system. In this paper, four hybrid systems are proposed to improve the performance of CHP and compare with baseline condition. Capacity design and operation strategy of hybrid systems are applied to a case study of a greenhouse located in Mahabad, Iran and optimized by using technical, economic and environmental objective functions. Levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and CO2 emission rate are considered as the objective functions. For LCOE optimization, three scenarios are considered to evaluate the impacts of future energy prices and CO2 tax. In scenario i (Regional energy prices in Iran without CO2 tax), none of the proposed hybrid systems are competitive with the baseline case and the difference between LCOEs of the best hybrid system and baseline is 2.8 (sic)/kWh. In scenario ii (Regional energy prices in Iran with CO2 tax), although the difference between LCOEs decreases to 1.8 (sic)/kWh, none of the proposed hybrid systems are beneficial in comparison with the baseline. In Scenario iii (world average energy prices with CO2 tax), in contrast with previous scenarios, optimized LCOEs of two hybrid systems (11.15 and 11.4 6/kWh) are lower than baseline LCOE (17.56 (sic)/kWh). From CO2 emission point of view, all of the proposed optimized hybrid systems have lower CO2 emission than baseline. Finally, a multi-objective optimization is done to consider both techno-economic and environmental objective functions simultaneously and provide a powerful decision support tool. The results show that yearly CO2 emission of SOFC base CHP hybrid systems are averagely 62% lower than conventional systems. Moreover, they would be economically beneficial in the case of increasing energy prices and environmental limitations.

AB This paper presents a novel, dual stage, small-scale nitrogen axial turbine with a non-repeated annular area for a hybrid, open-closed Rankine cycle. The proposed power cycle integrates a closed Rankine with an open Rankine power cycle using liquid nitrogen from a cryogenic energy storage system. In a small scale expander within the proposed cycle, there is a need for low flow rate and high expansion ratio to achieve higher cycle efficiency. These conditions make the choice and the design of a cycle turbine a challenging task, compounded with little experimental data accessible in the literature. Introduction of the increased annular area throughout the dual turbine passages will lead to reduced flow velocity and reduced flow losses thus improving the expander efficiency. This work contributes to the knowledge advancement in the development of small-scale nitrogen expander working in hybrid open-closed Rankine cycle by integrating the mean-line method with three-dimensional CFD simulation to develop three expander configurations single-stage, repeated two stages, and non repeated two stages. The results revealed that the two-stage non-repeated annular area configuration manifested higher performance, with expander isentropic efficiency of 81.4% compared to 74.2% for the single stage configuration and 78.0% for the two repeated stage configuration at an expansion ratio of 3. Results also show that the thermal efficiency of the proposed cycle was increased by 5.7%.

AB A clear-sky solar irradiance model is certainly a basic tool in the estimation of solar resources. With all the abundance of such models, there is plenty of room for searching a clear-sky solar irradiance model with general applicability, i.e. to be able to provide high-accurate estimates in most places around the world. This paper reports an upgraded version (further referred to as SIMv.2) of our parametric clear-sky solar irradiance model SIMv.1, aiming to improve the accuracy of estimates in arid environment. The new elements of SIMv.2, such as new equations for aerosol absorption and downward fraction, have been introduced targeting a better capture of the peculiarities of the solar radiation extinction by aerosols. Overall, the results of testing SIMv.2 at twelve stations located in regions with temperate, arid and tropical climate show that SIMv.2 performs much better than SIMv.1, an improvement in nRMSE of 37.1% for global solar irradiance and of 24.7% for the diffuse component being noticed. The comparison with other fourteen clear-sky solar irradiance models at five stations located in arid climate places SIMv.2 in the class of the best performing models. The limitation of the SIMv.2 performance in extreme weather conditions is discussed in two cases.

The combination of a hygroscopic nature of the polymer shell, a high core/shell ratio, and a small MPCM size were found to improve the interface bonds between microcapsules and the GPC matrix, increase the energy storage capacity of GPC, and results in a good dispersion of MPCM in the GPC matrix. After adding 5.2 wt% MPCM to GPC, the power consumption for stabilizing the indoor temperature at 23 degrees C may be reduced by up to 18.5 +/- 0.3% for GPC containing PS-DVB/RT27 (paraffin Rubitherm (R) RT27 core and a shell of polystyrene cross-linked with divinylbenzene), 20.1 +/- 0.7% for GPC containing PMMA/PCM26 (paraffin mixture core with a crosslinked poly methyl methacrylate shell) and 25.9 +/- 0.3% for GPC containing MF/PCM24 (paraffin mixture core with a melamine-formaldehyde polymer shell). Adding MPCM to GPC induces a higher amount of air pockets, which weaken the compressive strength. Unfortunately, the same parameters that are advantageous for reducing the energy consumption also results in a greater decline of the compressive strength. The compressive strength is further reduced when the microcapsule core is in its liquid state. However, the compressive strength still satisfies the mechanical European regulation (EN 206-1, compressive strength class C20/25) for concrete applications, except for GPC containing 5.2 wt% of MF/PCM24.

AB Due to the superior catalytic property of calcium oxide in biodiesel production via transesterification, it is necessary to modify such catalyst to retain the catalytic property while overcoming the disadvantages related to the catalyst application in the process. The present study focused on the kinetic and thermodynamic studies on the transesterification of used cooking oil (UCO) catalyzed by mesoporous calcium titanate (MCT). The experiments were performed at room temperature, 65 degrees C, and 100 degrees C. Among the various models being studied, the Pseudo First order is the best model to describe the reaction kinetic. Data analysis showed that the rate constants, k, varied in the range of 0.0233-0.058 s(-1), while the activation energy, E-a was determined to be 21.25 kj.mol(-1). The following parameters were also obtained: -24 kJ.mol(-1) for enthalpy (Delta H), -0.16 kJ.mol(-1) K-1 for entropy (Delta S) and 25.62-35.70 kJ.mol(-1) for Gibb's free energy (Delta G). The results showed that the reaction was exothermic (Delta H < 0), and that the biodiesel oxidation reaction is non-spontaneous and endergonic in nature (Delta G > 0). This study demonstrates the potential of MCT catalyst in promoting the conversion UCO into biodiesel with high quality fuel properties.

AB The pressure drop between the gas transportation grid and local networks can be exploited to generate electricity by means of a turbo expander. However, a lack of performance indicators leads to incomprehension and underestimation of the actual benefits in terms of energy savings and carbon emission reductions, thus limiting the diffusion of such smart, energy-saving technology. For this reason, in this study, key performance indicators are proposed for natural gas pressure regulation stations with energy recovery. The waste energy recovery index is introduced by considering the possibility of system thermal integration and a reference theoretical sideways process, where a Joule-Thompson expansion occurs. Furthermore, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is evaluated through the carbon emission recovery index that quantifies the environmental benefits of the energy saving action. Different key performance indicator values have been calculated by means of custom prediction models based on system characteristics. Finally, in order to assess the accuracy of such models, a parallel simulation is conducted using UniSime Design Suite software. Here, the two system configurations are implemented: one related to the case study and one related to the reference sideways process. The results show that the model successfully predicts the heat needs of pressure reduction stations and, for a typical system configuration, characterised by an expansion ratio of 4.8, a maximum waste energy recovery of about 69% could be achieved when the system is operating at nominal conditions. Proposed KPIs turned out to be a helpful tool to manage design development and system operations. Moreover, the simplicity of the performance indexes makes them easy to implement in software for process control and simple to interpret for system operators.

AB Thermal-catalytic-Trombe (TC-Trombe) wall system can simultaneously realize the dual functions of space heating and air purification without added energy. Adopting the established coupled kinetic, thermal and mass model of TC-Trombe wall system, in terms of the seasonal performance of space heating and formaldehyde degradation in heating seasons in Hefei, the effect of the thermal storage by the massive wall and the comparisons with conventional Trombe wall system are investigated. The results indicate to some degree, the thermal storage by the massive wall decreases the performance of formaldehyde degradation and space heating for TC-Trombe wall system. Compared with the performance of conventional Trombe wall system, although existing the reduction of 28.3% in terms of the total thermal load reduction for TC-Trombe wall system, this combined system can constantly produce the total volume of clean air of 8328.7 m(3)/m(2). Based on the analytical results, TC-Trombe wall with the sandwich structure is proposed. And the calculation results show that with the adding of the sandwich structure in TC-Trombe wall system, the total volume of clean air and total thermal load reduction increases by 20.9% and 34.9%, respectively. And TC-Trombe wall with the sandwich structure obtains the total volume of clean air of 10068.4 m(3)/m(2) and total thermal load reduction of 270.6 MJ/m(2) when the thermal insulation layer thickness is 20 mm. Therefore, TC-Trombe wall with the sandwich structure provides an efficient energy-saving strategy for obtaining a healthy and comfortable indoor environment using the solar energy.

AB This paper presents the results of modeling and parameterization of the high-altitude wind energy system ground station power-plant equipped with a generator/motor unit as a primary power source tethered to the airborne module via a winch system, an ultracapacitor energy storage system, and grid inverter connected to the common direct-current link. Consequently, a suitable ground station power plant control strategy is designed, comprising the generator/motor speed control and cable tension control system, direct-current link power flow coordination control, and grid-side inverter control strategy. Control system design is exclusively based on the damping optimum criterion which provides a straightforward way of closed-loop damping tuning. The effectiveness of the proposed ground station control strategy is verified by means of comprehensive computer simulations. These have pointed out to precise coordination of the winch electrical servodrive with the airborne module-related rope force control system and sustained power production during the airborne module ascending phase in the presence of high-altitude wind disturbances, and continuous power delivery to the grid-side inverter, facilitated by the utilization of ultracapacitor energy storage. This indicates rather robust behavior of the overall ground station control system under anticipated external disturbance conditions.

AB This paper explores the impact of different control strategies and electric tariff structures on the optimal ice storage capacity in relation to system economy for four typical buildings of hotel, restaurant, mall and office. The ice storage rate and electric price ratio are introduced to denote the various ice storage capacities and the different electric tariff structures, respectively. Then the chiller capacity and economic evaluation index value corresponding to each typical building with various ice storage rates and electric price ratios under three control strategies (chiller priority, storage priority, and optimizing) are calculated. The results indicated that there is respective optimal ice storage rate corresponding to both the minimal chiller capacity and the minimal economic evaluation index value. The optimal ice storage rate in relation to minimal chiller capacity is constant value under each control strategy. Such optimal values under both chiller priority and optimized control strategies are equivalent and less than that under storage priority control strategy. However, the optimal ice storage rate in relation to minimal economic evaluation index value under each control strategy is significantly affected by the electric tariff structures. The corresponding optimal ice storage rates under both chiller priority and optimized control strategies are equivalent and increase to a definite value with the increase in the electric price ratio. While the optimal ice storage rate under storage priority control strategy will appear when electric price ratio is greater than 3. The results also showed that, when electric price ratio increases to a certain value, the optimal ice storage rates corresponding to both minimal economic expense and minimal chiller capacity under each control strategy for the four typical buildings are equivalent.

AB This paper describes a methodology for determining the optimal envelope shape that minimizes the solar array area of a high altitude airship to be deployed at a specified geographical location. It identifies the critical day of the year and the optimal altitude of deployment on that day, and determines the smallest area of solar array that is just sufficient to meet all the operating requirements. This ensures that the airship can be deployed round the clock throughout the year at that specific geographical location, without any power shortfall. The methodology involves eleven design variables whose values are affected by parameters stemming from four disciplines, viz., Environment, Geometry, Aerodynamics, and Energy. Candidate envelope profiles are generated using a standard shape generation algorithm, and their volumetric drag coefficient is estimated using a surrogate based aerodynamic model. Envelope shapes corresponding to minimum solar area obtained by coupling the methodology to an optimizer based on Genetic Algorithms. To study the effect of the season of deployment, optimal envelope shapes were obtained for deployment on three specific days of the year (viz., Winter solstice, Summer solstice and Equinox) for an assumed altitude of deployment. It was seen that area of solar arrays needed for the airship were 4-9% lower than that for the baseline airship envelope. However, when the altitude of deployment and day of operation were allowed to vary, the optimal envelope shapes obtained had 35% lower solar area.

AB Due to the finite resources of fossil fuels and their role as the most important factor in air pollution and climate change, the use of renewable energy sources is the best solution to meet the power requirements. One of the appropriate technologies in terms of energy saving and power generation with high efficiency is using the cogeneration of heat and power in which renewable fuels are used instead of fossil fuels. In the present work, a cogeneration system, consisting of a gas turbine cycle with power generation capacity of 30 MW, a steam generator, an anaerobic digester, and a heat exchanger for heating the digester and pretreatment system, has been applied. The purpose is the thermodynamic and the exergo-economic evaluation of a cogeneration of heat and power cycle (CHP), considering the three objective functions of first and second law efficiencies, and the total specific cost of the system. The combined heat and power plant was fueled by the mixture of natural gas and biogas. A parametric investigation was conducted to assess the influences of decision parameters on the performance and the total cost rate of the cycle. The results showed that in the absence of biogas (high mixing ratios) the irreversibilities of the combustion chamber and the heat recovery steam generator are high, and at low mixing ratios those of the combustion chamber and the anaerobic digester are significant. The irreversibility of the combustion chamber at all the mixing ratios is the highest value. The exergy efficiency of the cycle is increased from 46.94% in the case of pure biogas to 50.64% in the case of pure natural gas. Also, the total specific cost of the system is increased from 66.7 $/MWh in the case of pure natural gas to 98.71 $/MWh in the case of the pure biogas. Dual fuel GT-CHP is an interesting option to access for high efficiency, high flexibility arid plant reliability at low cost in comparison to only biogas systems, facilitating a blend of fossil fuel and renewable resource systems.

AB Despite the thermal efficiency improvement, gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines are facing with the problem of particulate matter (PM) emissions. In this study, the effects of control parameters (spark advance, injection pressure, excess air ratio and EGR) on the combustion, performance and particulate matter emissions of a GDI engine were investigated. Furthermore, Taguchi method was carried out to determine the optimal combination of factors for the specific best engine output by adopting orthogonal array experiment, and ANOVA analysis was applied to examine the influence levels of tested parameters. Experimental results showed that retarding ignition timing, rising injection pressure, adding proper amount of air and EGR diluents will all reduce particulate number (PN) concentration, and the later three methods will improve fuel economy either. Retarding ignition timing and EGR dilution will increase the fraction of nucleation mode particles, while the other two will reduce it. The optimal combination for the lowest PN is 17 degrees spark timing, 7.0 MPa injection pressure, 60 degrees CA ATDC injection timing and 20% cooled EGR at stoichiometric mode, and 17 spark timing, 7.0 MPa injection pressure, 90 degrees CA ATDC injection timing and 20% cooled EGR at lean -bum mode. The most significant factor that affects NOx emissions and BSFC is EGR mode. Injection timing presents the highest contribution level to PN emissions, especially at lean -burn condition.

AB In the present study, cultivation of Chlorella vulgaris was extensively explored under semi-continuous approach to enhance its growth. The microalgae were cultivated in a photobioreactor supplemented with compost derived from chicken waste as an alternative nutrients source in both batch and semi-continuous cultivations. It was found that Chlorella vulgaris grew well up to 17 cycles of semi-continuous cultivation based on the following conditions for each cycle (3 days per cycle): 30% (v/v) removal of cultivation medium and 0.04 L/L of chicken compost in cultivation medium of pH 3. The average biomass productivity attained through these conditions was 0.0736 g/L/day, which was higher than batch cultivation (0.0568 g/L/day). Besides, the average total lipid content from each cycle under semi-continuous cultivation was maintained in the range of 25-35 wt%. The success of lipid extraction from the microalgae biomass was evidenced by the result of Fourier Transform Infrared Red (FT-IR) analysis that revealed lower peak intensity of carbon, especially in the range 2809-3012 cm(-1) after lipid extraction. It was also worthwhile to mention that the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) compositions of Chlorella vulgaris consisted mainly of C16:0 and C18:3 that were not significantly altered during the semi-continuous cultivation. Both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in the harvested biomass accounted for approximately 26.3% and 73.3%, respectively, within 5 cycles of the cultivation.

AB In this study, exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental approaches were applied to evaluate and optimize the performance of a low-energy consumption, high frequency piezoelectric ultrasonic reactor used to synthesize biodiesel from waste cooking oil (WCO). The effects of various process parameters viz. methanol/oil molar ratio (X), transesterification temperature (T), and residence time (t) on the exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental variables were comprehensively assessed and discussed. The exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental variables were cost and environmental impact per unit of exergy for the product, relative cost and environmental impact differences, cost and environmental impact associated with exergy destruction, and exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental factors. An optimization study was also carried out using a coupled scheme of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). Two more relevant exergy-based variables, i.e., cost and environmental per unit of exergy for the product as objective functions were modeled using the ANFIS approach on the basis of process parameters. The process yield as a threshold function was similarly simulated using the ANFIS approach. The optimum operating conditions of the system were then explored by NSGA-II algorithm through minimizing both objective functions while complying with the ASTM standard on process yield (i.e., conversion efficiency > 96.5%). Overall, the process parameters profoundly affected the exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental variables. Results indicated that the ANFIS approach accurately predicted the objective and threshold functions with an R-2 > 0.99. The optimum operating conditions were: X = 7.4, T = 60 degrees C, and t = 10 min. Under these conditions, the cost and environmental impact per unit of exergy for the product were respectively found to be 2.23 USD/GJ and 1.32 mPts/GJ, whereas the process yield stood at 96.5% meeting the ASTM standard. In general, exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental approaches appeared to be promising complements to the conventional exergy analysis for developing thermodynamically, economically, and environmentally conscious biodiesel production systems.

AB An experimental study on electro-spraying and catalytic combustion of ethanol at meso-scale is carried out. The electro-spraying process of ethanol is visualized and four typical spraying modes are identified. Based on droplet size measurements by a Phase Doppler Anemometer, the spraying at the cone jet or multi-jet mode is suitable for meso-scale combustion. Two meso-combustors without and with the platinum catalyst, denoted as combustor A and combustor B, respectively, are designed to conduct the comparative experiments. The flame temperature at the cone-jet mode is higher than those at other modes when equivalence ratio phi = 1.0, and for the combustor with catalyst, fuel-lean conditions are favorable for stable combustion. It is also found that the carbon monoxide mole fraction in the exhaust decreases by at least 25% due to the catalytic effect. At the cone-jet electro-spraying mode, the combustion efficiencies of ethanol reach the highest value for both combustor A and combustor B due to smaller droplet size and more uniform droplet size distribution. Under the same conditions, combustion efficiency of ethanol can be improved by 4.5% for combustor B, which proves that the platinum catalyst can accelerate the decomposition of ethanol.

AB The paper proposes a simulation approach to evaluate the power required by a rotorcraft in standard flight missions and in emergency landing maneuvers, and the corresponding fuel consumption, in order to compare the feasibility and potential fuel savings for different hybrid power systems. More in detail, three options are analyzed, namely electrification of the tail rotor, fully hybrid electric propulsion and electric emergency landing. Weight penalty and potential fuel saving for the proposed hybridization schemes are evaluated for an Agusta-Westland A109 twin engine helicopter model. Nonetheless the discussed methods of analysis have general validity for single main rotor helicopter configurations.
   Two different scenarios are considered in this investigation: current technologies for batteries and motors and improved electrical components, with performance projections as of 2040. According to this analysis, electrification of the tail rotor and parallel hybridization are feasible with available technology, whereas a fully electrical power system for emergency landing could be developed only in the future. Finally, a parallel hybrid electric power system is sized according to the analysis of power request over four different missions. Fuel savings are evaluated for different energy management strategies. According to the results of this investigation, the parallel hybrid electric power system with present-day and future technologies can save fuel up to 5% and 12%, respectively, with an appropriate energy management strategy.

AB Transient response of a hybrid system composed of concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) cell and thermoelectric generator (TEG) is investigated in this study. This research is carried out by using a numerical simulation approach thermally coupled between the CPV and TEG. A transient model is established and solved by finite volume algorithm. In spite of temperatures profile in the hybrid CPV-TEG module, as results of variation of solar irradiation, power generation and efficiency of the CPV and TEG under the transient condition are presented. The results show that efficiency of the TEG and CPV varies diversely versus changing the solar radiation and module temperature. Moreover, the thermal response of the TEG stabilizes temperature fluctuation of the hybrid module when the solar radiation rapidly changes. In this work, impact of the thermal contact resistance on the temperature profile and system efficiency is investigated. The model presented in this study provides a fundamental understanding of the thermal and electrical effect of the TEG in hybrid CPV-TEG module under transient conditions.

AB The optimal power generation of hydro-thermal systems to minimize total operating costs is one of the most important targets in short-term hydro-thermal scheduling (STHS) and its evaluation is complicated by several complex and interconnected equality and inequality constraints.
   To solve this type of problem, it is necessary to develop on one side a model of the system characterized by a fair and proper treatment of all the equality and inequality constraints and on the other a performing optimization algorithm simultaneously considering not only the minimization of the operating costs but also the feasibility of the proposed solution.
   The paper presents a novel two-swarm based PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) search strategy developed for solving these kinds of STHS problems. To exclude constraint violations as far as possible during the optimization process, first a complete inequality and equality constraints treatment of the hydrothermal systems was developed, combined with a fair spillage modelling. Then, a recent evolution of the particle swarm optimization algorithm ASD-PSO (Adaptive Search Diversification-Particle Swarm Optimization) was modified, introducing a secondary swarm able to exploit the potential contribution of the infeasible solutions. Within the context of this new strategy, two different swarms were designed, each characterized by a different treatment of the infeasible solutions, and each interacting properly with the other at every iteration.
   The primary swarm dealt with feasible solutions, resulting from the manipulation of constraint repairing strategies, and with a limited number of infeasible solutions whose potential contribution in the search process was not wasted out but it was properly weighted on the basis of the violation degree. The secondary swarm involved less manipulated solutions that were subjected only to one repair strategy in order to foster the exploration capability of the swarm. At each iteration, the two swarms independently update their position and velocity but partially interact with each other to obtain mutual advantages from their different peculiarities.
   This novel two-swarm based strategy for solving short-term hydro-thermal scheduling (STHS) problems was validated by comparing the achieved performance in terms of accuracy with those of several algorithms proposed in literature. Six different test cases, widely analysed in the literature and characterized by increasing complexity, were considered. In all the considered Test Cases, the algorithm performed very well with minimum total fuel costs that were still lower than all the feasible solutions proposed in the literature, and that satisfied all the equality and inequality constraints of the system.

AB In this paper an original simulation and optimization model for flat solar collector coupled with a flat bottom reflector has been developed. The problem of simulation and optimization for such system is essential in order to find the proper configuration of the reflector able to obtain the expected maximum efficiency of the whole system. The proposed simulation model analytically determines the solar energy on the collector-reflector system and therefore the optimization model estimates the optimal values of the design parameters. A new comprehensive formulation of the shadowing and irradiating level on the collector, able to take into account the finite length geometry with variable dimensions, is presented. The number and the value of the angular positions, the time periods over which the angular positions should be adjusted, the size, the aspect ratio, between the length and the width of the reflector, and the overhangs are parameters treated simultaneously with a global optimization procedure. The model is integrated with an original scheme of optimization where energetic and economic aspects are both taken into account.
   The simulations results of the study reveal the optimal number of angular adjustments per year, the existence of a small optimal neighborhood of the aspect ratio and the optimal size of the reflector, for which the maximum reduction of the payback time of the augmented system compared to its reference collector is achieved. The results presented in the study are related to the solar data of Italian latitude, but they can be easily extended for any geographical location.

AB Currently, the conventional Fushun-type retorting process is the most main way of shale oil production in China. However, it has many disadvantages, such as low resource utilization efficiency and severe environmental pollution inevitably. In this paper, the framework of exergetic life cycle assessment (ELCA) is applied to the shale oil production process, and the indicator of resource utilization efficiency (gamma) and the indicator of environmental sustainability (zeta) were defined to evaluate the performance of the resource utilization efficiency and environmental sustainability. The results indicate that the Aspen Plus simulation results are reasonably consistent with industrial data. The yield of shale oil is 4.52 kg/s by the pyrolysis of 100 kg/s oil shale. The framework of ELCA is applicable for the Fushun-type shale oil production process. During the whole life cycle, the cumulative exergy consumption (CExC) and the Abatement exergy (AbatEx) of pollutants (per kg shale oil produced) are 225.65 MJ and 61.69 MJ, respectively. The retorting stage has the lowest exergy efficiency, 62.49%, followed by the semi coke gasification stage 63.15%. The gamma and zeta values in shale oil production stage are very poor, 42.64% and 32.64%, respectively. When the retorting temperature is set to 500 degrees C and the saturation of feeding air is controlled to 80 degrees C, the gamma and zeta values of the whole life cycle achieve the greatest potential, 35.85% and 28.05%, respectively.

AB A sizing multi-objective optimisation using the genetic algorithm is performed on a solar-hydrogen combined heat and power system integrated with solar-thermal collectors (SH CHP-ST) to supply both power and heat (i.e. hot water demand) to an application. A solar-hydrogen system is a renewable system with hydrogen-based storage consisting of an electrolyser, a hydrogen tank, and a fuel cell. The fuel cell generates heat while producing power that can be recovered. The heat collected from the fuel cell can be integrated with the heat supply of a renewable solar-thermal system consisting of an evacuated tube collector and a hot water storage tank. A simulation module to model the operation of the whole system is implemented in MATLAB. Energy demands and meteorological data for a remote household located in southeast Australia are considered. The sizes of the main components of the system are optimised with the objectives of maximising the overall reliability of the system, minimising the levelised cost of energy, and minimising the percentage of excess energy from the PV that is not utilised. The results show that the electric reliability of the optimal solutions in favour is always equal to 100%. The maximum thermal reliability that could be obtained is around 96%. A trade-off between the cost of energy and percentage of wasted power from PV is found.

AB Microwave-assisted transesterification of glycerol to glycerol carbonate (GC) using calcined sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) as a catalyst in the sealed reaction system was studied in this work. Effects of the parameters, including the molar ratio of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) to glycerol, the reaction temperature, the amount of the catalyst, the reaction time and, especially, the microwave-assisted reaction modes on glycerol conversion and GC yield were carefully investigated. It was found that the microwave-assisted reaction modes, namely, the temperature constant mode (TCM) and the power constant mode (PCM), greatly influenced the reaction. When the reaction was conducted in TCM, with the catalyst amount of 5 wt%, reaction temperature of 95 degrees C, DMC-to-glycerol molar ratio of 4:1, and reaction time of 15 min, the glycerol conversion and the GC yield reached 96.7% and 94.3%, respectively. Similar glycerol conversion and GC yield were also obtained under the condition of the catalyst amount of 1 wt%, DMC-to-glycerol molar ratio of 4:1, microwave irradiation input power of 175 W and reaction time of 50 s in PCM. The reaction in PCM showed much more advantages in reducing the amount of the catalyst and shortening the reaction time than that in TCM. Meanwhile, the transesterification of glycerol with DMC in PCM catalyzed by Na2SiO3 exhibited much higher reaction rate than that catalyzed by CaO. Moreover, in terms of the reaction in PCM, energy consumption could be reduced with the increase of the irradiation power. The investigation on the reusability of the Na2SiO3 catalyst in PCM showed that this catalyst could be reused in five reaction cycles without significant deactivation.

AB Developing coal to hydrogen is a crucial way to alleviate the conflict between demand and supply of hydrogen. In this paper, a coal to hydrogen process based on ash agglomerating fluidized bed gasification is proposed and simulated. Based on the simulation results, the thermodynamic analysis and economic evaluation of the coal to hydrogen process are carried out to provide theoretical guidance for the development and investment of the coal to hydrogen process. The results show that the energy efficiency is 43%, the exergy efficiency is 40% and the total exergy loss is 73,315 kW. Gasification unit occupies 63.66% of the total exergy loss and should prefer to be improved. In addition, the total capital investment, total production cost, payback period, net present value and return on investment are estimated for four different plant sizes. The results show that the costs and profitability vary significantly with the plant size. Finally, the influences of coal price and hydrogen price on the economic performance of the coal to hydrogen process are investigated.

AB At present, wind forecast based on Numerical Weather Prediction is widely recognized and applied for a safer and more sufficient usage of wind sources. However, because of the unescapable inherent errors of numerical techniques, there are many negative cases of forecasts. Thus, aiming to quantize and evaluate the inherent errors of physical outcomes, this paper analyzes the characteristic of residuals between numerical results and actual measured data In statistical way, designs combined non-linear and non-parameter algorithms to correct original prediction values, and achieves probabilistic one-day-ahead 96-step wind speed forecasts. The concise process of the method can be described as followings. Firstly, this work utilizes autocorrelation analysis to verify the non noise attribute of error sequences. Based on the characteristic, adaptive and structured error correction models of nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs network are established to acquire deterministic optimized outcomes. Then, aiming to calculate conditional error boundaries of different confidence levels, mixture kernel density estimation is adopted step by step to estimate joint probability density of corrected values and revised errors. The results on test set show the correction considering inherent errors of numerical techniques can integrate the physical with statistical information effectively and enhance the forecast accuracy indeed.

AB This study introduces a new estimation approach that could be used in calculating the Weibull parameters for the estimation of wind power. This new approach, called the method of multi-objective moments (MUOM), proposes minimization of the squared deviances between the first three population moments and corresponding sample moments. In the proposed MUOM, the third moment, which is used in the formula of wind power, is a key function since it provides a significant contribution to the correct prediction of wind energy. In order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed MUOM, it is compared with the well-known estimation methods such as the maximum likelihood, modified maximum likelihood, moment and energy pattern factor. In comparative analysis, the performance of the considered methods is evaluated on the actual wind speed data measured different time periods according to various goodness of fit criteria. The obtained results indicate that the MUOM definitely provides more accurate estimates than other well-known methods in estimating wind power based on the Weibull distribution. Thus, the MUOM can be used as an improved method in estimating wind power.

AB Reverse electrodialysis in closed loop configurations is a promising membrane technology in the energy conversion and storage fields. One of the main advantages of closed-loop reverse electrodialysis is the possibility of using a wide range of operating concentrations, flow rates and different salts for generating the salinity gradient. In this work, an original exergy analysis of the reverse electrodialysis process was carried out in order to investigate reverse electrodialysis performance in terms of energetic and exergetic efficiency parameters in a wide range of operating conditions. A mono-dimensional model of the reverse electrodialysis process was developed, in which all sources of irreversibility are considered, such as non-ideal membranes permselectivity, ohmic losses and uncontrolled mixing phenomena (salt and water diffusive flux across membranes). For each of them, the influence on the exergy efficiency is quantified and compared. Results also indicate how exergetic and energetic performance are largely dependent on solutions concentration: when high salinity gradient differences are used within the unit, membrane water permeability heavily affects process performance, thus reducing exergy efficiency, though a larger power output can be normally achieved. The more performing flow arrangement for the stack has been found to be the counter-current, though significant differences are observed only for long channels. Finally, performance is improved when short residence time within the stack is attained for the low concentration solution.

AB Multi-pressure evaporation organic Rankine cycle involves two or more evaporation processes with different pressures. Compared to the conventional single-pressure evaporation type, the multi-pressure evaporation type can significantly reduce the exergy loss in the endothermic process, and its widely used in the heat-work conversion of low and medium temperature (< 350 degrees C) thermal energy is promising. The turbine layout of the multi-pressure evaporation type has two typical forms: the separate turbine layout and induction turbine layout. Turbines in two layouts may exhibit considerable differences in the geometric and operating parameters. Selecting a suitable turbine layout is crucial to improve the system thermo-economic performance. While, the thermo-economic performance variations and comparison of two turbine layouts remain indeterminate for various operating conditions. This study was based on the one-dimensional efficiency model and purchased equipment cost model of the radial-flow turbine. The thermo-economic performance of two turbine layouts was analyzed and compared for nine pure organic fluids. Effects of two-stage evaporation pressures on the thermo-economic performance of two turbine layouts were also studied. Results show that the total power output of the induction turbine layout can increase by 0.3-5.4%, and its specific investment cost is lower for most of operating conditions and the maximum decrement is 34.2%, compared to the separate turbine layout. The decrement in the specific investment cost decreases as the high-stage evaporation pressure increases, and it generally increases as the low-stage evaporation pressure increases. Moreover, the total power output is larger, the thermo-economic advantage of the induction turbine layout is generally greater.

AB The heat and mass transfer simulation model of a ground heat exchanger (GHE) directly affects the design and operation performance of a ground-coupled heat pump system. The GHE models based on the response function (like the Green function and g-function) can achieve a fast calculation speed. However, the heat sources in these models are limited to points or whole boreholes, leading to low calculation accuracy in heat transfer during a short time period and limitation to a certain GHE. A general distributed parameter model for a ground heat exchanger (RF model) is proposed based on the principle of response factors in this paper. A sandbox experimental platform is then built to test the temperatures of typical points in the double-layered soil and to validate the RF model. After that, the calculation of the RF model is simplified by determining suitable positions for the soil boundaries and the numbers of sub pipes and sub soil boundaries. Finally, the RF model is applied in different scenarios to demonstrate its characteristics. The results show that: (1) the RF model is suitable for different kinds of GHEs with arbitrary shape and type of heat sources releasing heat in arbitrary time steps; (2) the RF model has only 0.01 degrees C and 0.23 degrees C temperature response errors compared to those from numerical solutions and experiments, respectively; (3) the general RF model has similar accuracy to the numerical solution in calculating the distributed temperatures of the borehole and pipes, heat transfer in the short term, and heat transfer of borehole groups and the energy pile.

AB At present synchrotron and neutron sources are the preferred choices for the Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analysis, but there is a need to explore PDF in a laboratory XRD system for quick feedback about the short range structure of the amorphous materials. Present work considered both crystalline (quartz) and amorphous silica to study the structural differences in silica by PDF analysis using Ag radiations in laboratory XRD. The structural information about short range ordering of the oxygen (0) atoms around silicon (Si) atoms as obtained by the PDF were compared with the results as obtained by Near Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) and RAMAN experiments. The PDF studies showed that the amorphous silica possessed short range periodicity within the basic unit of (SiO4)(4-) tetrahedra with a Si-O & O-O distance are of about 1.622 angstrom and 2.713 angstrom while the short range as well as long range ordered structure present in quartz with Si-O &O-O distance are 1.562 angstrom and 2.661 angstrom respectively. Raman spectra showed some asymmetry in amorphous silica which corresponds to the defects present in the lattice and thus forming the n-fold ring structure with Si and O resulting in the wide variation of bridging bond angle Si-O-Si in amorphous silica. NEXAFS studies revealed the structure of amorphous silica and quartz in the intermediate range (3-5 angstrom) at the Si L and O K edges. The structural information about short range ordering of the O around Si atoms as obtained by these methods were found to be in good match with the results as obtained by PDF, suggesting this technique may be used as a screening tool for routine PDF studies of amorphous materials.

AB A new glass system xSeO(2)(1-x)[40P(2)O(5)-30CaO-20MgO-10Na(2)O] with nominal concentration of SeO2 ranging between 0 and 20 mol% was obtained by melting method. The amount of selenium determined on samples surface is much lower than that expected according to the added SeO2 amount, and this is due first to selenium volatility during melting. The Fourier transform infrared and Raman results evidence the glass network depolymerisation induced by progressive addition of selenium. The depolymerisation effect occurs more pronounced on samples surface than in their inside, as indicated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis with respect to the dependence of bridging and non-bridging oxygens on selenium content.

Fluorescence upon UV excitation changes drastically from pink color in the untreated porous glass to blue color in the sintered glass, in which the characteristic Eu3+ emission in red-orange spectral range is inhibited. The native and the sintered porous glass present an intrinsic fluorescence in the blue spectral region upon UV excitation, which is related with defects in the silica network. The microstructure and elemental distribution in the sintered glass was investigated by TEM and EDX and related with the luminescence properties.

AB The role of the Tarim Block in the reconstruction of the Neoproterozoic supercontinent Rodinia remains contentious. Here we report a suite of high-Mg gabbroic dykes from the Yingfeng area in northwestern Quanji Massif, which is considered as a fragment of the Tarim Block in NW China. Magmatic zircons from these dykes yield to have a weighted mean Pb-206/U-238 age of 822.2 +/- 5.3 Ma, recording the timing of their emplacement. The gabbros have high MgO (9.91-13.09 wt%), Mg numbers (69.89-75.73) and CaO (8.41-13.55 wt%), medium FeO, (8.50-9.67 wt%) and TiO2 (0.67-0.93 wt%), variable Al2O3 (13.04-16.07 wt%), and high Cr (346.14-675.25 ppm), but relatively low Ni (138.72-212.94 ppm), suggestive of derivation from a primary magma. The rocks display chondrite-normalized LREE patterns with weak fractionation but flat HREE patterns relative to those of the N-MORB. Their primitive mantle normalized trace elemental patterns show positive Rb, Ba and U but negative Th, Nb, Ti and Zr anomalies, carrying characteristics of both mid-ocean ridge basalts and arc basalts. The elif(t) values of the zircons from these rocks vary from +4.7 to +13.5 with depleted mantle model ages (T-DM) of 1.23-0.85 Ga, and the youngest value nearly approaching that for the coeval depleted mantle, suggesting significant addition of juvenile materials. Our data suggest that the strongly depleted basaltic magma was probably sourced from a depleted mantle source that had undergone metasomatism by subduction-related components in a back-arc setting. Accordingly we postulate that a subduction-related tectonic regime possibly prevailed at similar to 0.8 Ga along the southeastern margin of the Tarim Block. Combining with available information from the northern Tarim Block, we propose an opposite verging double-sided subduction model for coeval subduction of the oceanic crust beneath both the southern and northern margins of the Tarim Block during early Neoproterozoic.

AB The Paleoproterozoic (1.7 Ga) basement rocks from Maddhapara, Bangladesh show a large range of chemical variations (e.g. SiO2 = 50.7-74.7%) and include diorite, quartz diorite, monzodiorite, quartz monzonite and granite. The pluton overall displays metaluminous, calc-alkaline orogenic suite; mostly I-type suites formed within subduction-related magmatism. The observed major elements show general trends for fractional crystallization. Trace element contents also indicate the possibility of a fractionation or assimilation; explain the entire variation from diorite to monzonite, even granite. The pluton may have evolved the unique chemical features by a process that included partial melting of calc-alkaline lithologies and mixing of mantle-derived magmas, followed by fractional crystallization, and by assimilation of country rocks. The pluton shows evidence of crystal fractionation involving largely plagioclase, amphibole and possibly biotite. Some of the fractionated magmas may have mixed with more potassic melts from distinct parts of the continental lithosphere to produce granites and/or pegmatites.
   New geochronological results of granitic pegmatite (1722 +/- 10 Ma) are indisputably consistent with diorite and tonalite and those data showing credible geochronological sequence (i.e., diorite - tonalite - granitic pegmatite). Identical Paleoproterozoic age (1.7 Ga) with distinctive magmatism of the Maddhapara basement rocks have agreeable relationship with the CITZ, India. The consistent magmatism is also common in the Transamazonian of South America, Trans-Hudson orogeny in North America, Bohemian Massif and the Svecofennian, Poland, have identified the sequential growth of the continent through the amalgamation of juvenile terrains, succeeded by a major collisional orogeny. Such Paleoproterozoic subduction-related orogens in Australia have similar counterparts in Antarctica and other part of the world. These types of Paleoproterozoic magmatism dominantly contributed to assemble, amalgamation and breakup of the enormous Columbia supercontinent.

AB Gondwana correlation studies had rationally positioned the western continental margin of India (WCMI) against the eastern continental margin of Madagascar (ECMM), and the eastern continental margin of India (ECMI) against the eastern Antarctica continental margin (EACM). This contribution computes the effective elastic thickness (Te) of the lithospheres of these once-conjugated continental margins using the multitaper Bouguer coherence method. The results reveal significantly low strength values (Te similar to 2 km) in the central segment of the WCMI that correlate with consistently low Te values (2-3 km) obtained throughout the entire marginal length of the ECMM. This result is consistent with the previous Te estimates of these margins, and confirms the idea that the low-Te segments in the central part of the WCMI and along the ECMM represents paleo-rift inception points of the lithospheric margins that was thermally and mechanically weakened by the combined action of the Marion hotspot and lithospheric extension during the rifting. The uniformly low-Te value (similar to 2 km) along the EACM indicates a mechanically weak lithospheric margin, probably due to considerable stretching of the lithosphere, considering the fact that this margin remained almost stationary throughout its rift history. In contrast, the ECMI has comparatively high-Te variations (5-11 km) that lack any correlation with the regional tectonic setting. Using gravity forward and inversion applications, we find a leading order of influence of sediment load on the flexural properties of this marginal lithosphere. The study concludes that the thick pile of the Bengal Fan sediments in the ECMI masks and has erased the signal of the original load-induced topography, and its gravity effect has biased the long-wavelength part of the observed gravity signal. The hence uncorrelated flat topography and deep lithospheric flexure together contribute a bias in the flexure modeling, which likely accounts a relatively high Te estimate.

AB The Luanchuan ore fields form part of the East Qinling metallogenic belt in central China. In this study, we compare two ore-bearing intrusions, the Shibaogou granitic pluton (SBG) and the Zhongyuku granitic pluton (ZYK), with the ore-barren Laojunshan intrusion (LIS) from the Luanchuan ore field. Geochemically, all the three intrusions are characterized by high-Si, high-K, and alkalis, together with moderate-ASI, exhibiting I-type granite features. The rocks, especially the ore-related plutons also show enrichment in LREEs. Mineral chemistry of biotite from the intrusions exhibits similar features of high Si and Mg, and low Al and Fe. Zircon grains from the ZYK intrusion yielded a U-Pb age of 149.6 +/- 2.4 Ma. The zircon grains show epsilon(Hf) (t) values and two stage model ages (T-DM2) in the range of -16.8 to -19.7 and 1998-2156 Ma respectively. The biotite composition and Hf isotopic data indicate that the magma was derived by re-melting of deep crustal material with minor input of mantle components. We evaluate the results to understand the physico-chemical conditions, petrogenesis, and tectonic setting, and their implications for mineral exploration. The ore-bearing plutons show wide ranges of temperature and oxygen fugacity, favoring Mo-W mineralization. In addition, estimates on pressure and depth of emplacement suggest that lower solidification pressure in a decompressional setting contributed to the evolution of magmatic hydrothermal deposits. Our data suggest that the ZYK has the highest potential for Mo-W mineralization. The ore-bearing plutons of ZYK and SBG were formed in a transitional tectonic setting from compression to extension, with the large-scale metallogeny triggered by slab melts at ca. 145 Ma. However, the ore-barren US batholith formed in an extension-related geodynamic setting at similar to 115 Ma. Our study shows that different tectonic settings and consequent physico-chemical conditions dictated the ore potential of the intrusions in the Luanchuan ore district.

AB Carboniferous biotite granite, Late Permian hornblende granite, and Triassic biotite-hornblende granite, all of which belong to the Eastern Granite Belt, expose in the Wang Nam Khiao area, Nakhon Ratchasima, northeastern Thailand. The Carboniferous biotite granite is dominated by quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase, and biotite. The Late Permian hornblende granite contains dominant assemblages of plagioclase, quartz, K-feldspar, hornblende, and minor amount of biotite, while the Triassic biotite-hornblende granite consists of quartz, plagioclase, K-feldspar with small amounts of biotite, and hornblende. The REE patterns with steep decrease from light to heavy REE together with the LILE (e.g. K, Sr) enrichment and depletion of some particular HFSE (e.g. Nb, Ti) indicate low degree of partial melting. Mineral chemistry of biotite and hornblende in the granites reflects crystallization from hydrous calc-alkaline arc-derived magmas possibly formed by subduction. Amphibole-plagioclase thermometry and Al-in-hornblende barometry indicate that the Late Permian hornblende granite and the Triassic biotite-hornblende granite may have equilibrated at 3.0-5.8 kbar/700-820 degrees C and 2.0-3.2 kbar/600-750 degrees C, respectively, in the middle-upper crust (about 10-15 km depth). Zircon U-Pb geochronology of the Carboniferous biotite granite, Late Permian hornblende granite and Triassic biotite-hornblende granite yielded intrusion ages of 314.6-284.9 Ma, 253.4 Ma, and 237.8 Ma, respectively, which implies multiple episodes of arc-magmatism formed by Palaeo-Tethys subduction beneath Indochina Terrane during Late Carboniferous/Early Permian, Late Permian and Middle Triassic.

   PENINSULA
AB The cratonic destruction associated with the Pacific plate subduction beneath the eastern North China Craton (NCC) shows a close relationship with the widespread magmatism during the Late Mesozoic. Here we investigate a suite of intrusive and extrusive magmatic rocks from the Junan region of the eastern NCC in order to evaluate the role of extensive crustal melting related to decratonization. We present petrological, geochemical, zircon U-Pb geochronological and Lu-Hf isotopic data to evaluate the petrogenesis, timing and tectonic significance of the Early Cretaceous magmatism. Zircon grains in the basalt from the extrusive suite of Junan show multiple populations with Neoproterozoic and Early Paleozoic xenocrystic grains ranging in age from 764 Ma to 495 Ma as well as Jurassic grains with an age range of 189-165 Ma. The dominant population of magmatic zircon grains in the syenite defines three major age peaks of 772 Ma, 132 Ma and 126 Ma. Zircons in the granitoids including alkali syenite, monzonite and granodiorite yield a tightly restricted age range of 124-130 Ma representing their emplacement ages. The Neoproterozoic (841-547 Ma) zircon grains from the basalt and the syenite possess epsilon Hf (t) values of -22.9 to -8.4 and from -18.8 to -17.3, respectively. The Early Paleozoic (523-494 Ma) zircons from the basalt and the syenite also show markedly negative eHf(t) values of -22.7 to -18.0. The dominant population of Early Cretaceous (134-121 Ma) zircon grains presented in all the samples also displays negative eHf(t) values range from -31.7 to -21.1, with TOM of 1653-2017 Ma and TDMC in the range of 2193-3187 Ma. Accordingly, the Lu-Hf data suggest that the parent magma was sourced through melting of Mesoarchean to Paleoproterozoic basement rocks. Geochemical data on the Junan magmatic suite display features similar to those associated with the arc magmatic rocks involving subduction-related components, with interaction of fluids and melts in the suprasubduction mantle wedge. From the data presented, we propose that the Late Mesozoic intrusive and extrusive suites of Junan represent extensive lower and middle crustal melting, possibly triggered by mantle upwelling during the back-arc spreading associated with the Pacific plate subduction beneath the NCC. Intense asthenospheric upwelling resulted in lithospheric thinning and partial delamination during the Early Cretaceous, marking one of the peak decratonization stages of the NCC.

TI A Mesozoic orogenic cycle from post-collision to subduction in the

AB The Early to Middle Mesozoic basins, distributed sporadically over the Korean Peninsula, preserve important records of the tectonic history of some of the major orogenic belts in East Asia. Here we present a comprehensive study of the structural, geochemical, geochronological, and paleontological features of a volcano-sedimentary package, belonging to the Oseosan Volcanic Complex of the Early to Middle Mesozoic Chungnam Basin, within the Mesozoic subduction-collision orogen in the southwestern Korean Peninsula. The zircon U-Pb data from rhyolitic volcanic rocks of the complex suggest Early to Middle Jurassic emplacement age of ca. 178-172 Ma, harmonious with plant fossil taxa found from the overlying tuffaceous sedimentary rock. The geochemical data for the rhyolitic volcanic rocks are indicative of volcanic arc setting, implying that the Chungnam Basin has experienced an infra-arc subsidence during the basin-expanding stage by subduction of the Paleo-Pacific (Izanagi) Plate. The Jurassic arc-related Oseosan Volcanic Complex was structurally stacked by the older Late Triassic to Early Jurassic post-collisional basin-fill of the Nampo Group by the Jangsan fault during basin inversion. The Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous K-feldspar and illite K-Ar ages marked the timing of inversion tectonics, contemporaneous with the magmatic quiescence in the southern Korean Peninsula, likely due to flat lying or low-angle subduction. The basin evolution history preserved in the Mesozoic Chungnam Basin reflects a Mesozoic orogenic cycle from post-collision to subduction in the southwestern Korean Peninsula. This, in turn, provides a better understanding of the spatial and temporal changes in Mesozoic tectonic environments along the East Asian continental margin.

   GROWTH
AB Phanerozoic boninites record enrichments of U over Th, giving Th/U: 0.5-1.6, relative to intraoceanic island arc tholeiites (IAT) where Th/U averages 2.6. Uranium enrichment is attributed to incorporation of shallow, oxidized fluids, U-rich but Th-poor, from the slab into the melt column of boninites which form in near-trench to forearc settings of suprasubduction zone ophiolites. Well preserved Archean komatiite-tholeiite, plume-derived, oceanic volcanic sequences have primary magmatic Th/U ratios of 4.4-3.6, and Archean convergent margin IAT volcanic sequences, having REE and HFSE compositions similar to Phanerozoic IAT equivalents, preserve primary Th/U of 4-3.6. The best preserved Archean boninites of the 3.0 Ga Olondo and 2.7 Ga Gadwal greenstone belts, hosted in convergent margin ophiolite sequences, also show relative enrichments of U over Th, with low average Th/U similar to 3 relative to coeval IAT, and Phanerozoic counterparts which are devoid of crustal contamination and therefore erupted in an intraoceanic setting, with minimal contemporaneous submarine hydrothermal alteration. Later enrichment of U is unlikely as Th-U-Nb-LREE patterns are coherent in these boninites whereas secondary effects induce dispersion of Th/U ratios. The variation in Th/U ratios from Archean to Phanerozoic boninites of greenstone belts to ophiolitic sequences reflect on genesis of boninitic lavas at different tectono-thermal regimes. Consequently, if the explanation for U enrichment in Phanerozoic boninites also applies to Archean examples, the implication is that U was soluble in oxygenated Archean marine water up to 600 Ma before the proposed great oxygenation event (GOE) at similar to 2.4 Ga. This interpretation is consistent with large Ce anomalies in some hydrothermally altered Archean volcanic sequences aged 3.0-2.7 Ga.

AB The Pitepani volcanic suite of the Dongargarh Supergroup, central India comprises of a calc-alkaline suite and a tholeiitic suite, respectively. The rare earth element (REE) patterns, mantle normalized plots and relict clinopyroxene chemistry of the Pitepani calc-alkaline suite are akin to high-Mg andesites (HMA) and reveal remarkable similarity to the Cenozoic Setouchi HMA from Japan. The Pitepani HMAs are geochemically correlated with similar rocks in the Kotri-Dongargarh mobile belt (KDMB) and in the mafic dykes of the Bastar Craton. The rationale behind lithogeochemical correlations are that sanukitic HMAs represent fore-arc volcanism over a very limited period of time, under abnormally high temperature conditions and are excellent regional and tectonic time markers. Furthermore, the tholeiitic suites that are temporally and spatially associated with the HMAs in the KDMB and in the mafic dykes of the Bastar Craton are classified into: (a) a continental back-arc suite that are depleted in incompatible elements, and (b) a continental arc suite that are more depleted in incompatible elements, respectively. The HMA suite, the continental back-arc and continental arc suites are lithogeochemically correlated in the KDMB and in the mafic dykes of the Bastar Craton. The three geochemically distinct Neoarchaean magmatic suites are temporally and spatially related to each other and to an active continental margin. The identification of three active continental margin magmatic suites for the first time, provides a robust conceptual framework to unravel the Neoarchaean geodynamic evolution of the Bastar Craton. We propose an active continental margin along the Neoarchaen KDMB with eastward subduction coupled with slab roll back or preferably, ridge-subduction along the Central Indian Tectonic Zone (CITZ) to account for the three distinct magmatic suites and the Neoarchean geodynamic evolution of the Bastar Craton.

AB We report the first key paleopole as a result of paleomagnetic study on a precisely dated 1765.3 +/- 1.0 Ma WNW-ESE trending dyke swarm from Singhbhum Craton. This pole has been used in this study to propose the paleogeographic reconstruction of India with Baltica Craton and North China Craton. Incremental alternating field (AF) and thermal demagnetization, isolated high coercivity components with north to north-westerly declination and shallow negative inclination from 9 sampling sites which are representing different individual dykes. The primary origin of the ChRM is supported by the positive baked contact test. The WNW-ESE trending dykes yield a mean paleomagnetic direction with a declination = 329.2 degrees and an inclination = -22.8 degrees (k = 31.6; alpha 95 = 9.3 degrees). The positive bake contact test proves the primary nature of remanence. The pole position of Singhbhum Craton at 1765 Ma is 45 degrees N, 311 degrees E (dp = 5.2 and dm = 9.9). Paleogeographic reconstruction at ca. 1770 Ma, supported by geological, tectonic and metallogenic evidences indicate that the Baltica Craton and India linkage can be stable for at least similar to 370 Ma (similar to 1770-1400 Ma). There is also reasonable evidence in support of India-North China Craton spatial proximity at similar to 1770 Ma.

AB The Liitzow-Holm Complex (LHC) of East Antarctica forms a part of the latest Neoproterozoic-Cambrian high-grade metamorphic segment of the East African-Antarctic Orogen. Here we present new petrological, geo-chemical, and zircon U-Pb geochronological data on meta-igneous rocks from four localities (Austhovde, Telen, Skallevikshalsen, and Skallen) in the LHC, and evaluate the regional Paleoproterozoic (ca. 1.8 Ga) arc magmatism in this terrane for the first time. The geochemical features reveal a volcanic-arc affinity for most of the meta-igneous rocks from Austhovde and Telen, suggesting that the protoliths of these rocks were derived from felsic to mafic arc magmatic rocks. The protoliths of two mafic granulites from Austhovde are inferred as non volcanic-arc basalt such as E-MORB, suggesting the accretion of remnant oceanic lithosphere together with the volcanic-arc components during the subduction-collision events. The weighted mean Pb-206/U-238 ages of the dominant population of magmatic zircons in felsic orthogneisses from Austhovde and Telen show 1819 +/- 19 Ma and 1830 +/- 10 Ma, respectively, corresponding to Paleoproterozoic magmatic event. The magmatic zircons in orthogneisses from other two localities yield upper intercept ages of 1837 +/- 54 Ma (Skallevikshalsen), and 1856 +/- 37 Ma and 1854 +/- 45 Ma (Skallen), which also support Paleoproterozoic magmatism. The earlier thermal events during Neoarchean to Early Paleoproterozoic are also traced by (206)pb/U-238 ages of xenocrystic zircons in the felsic orthogneisses from Austhovde (2517 +/- 17 Ma and 2495 +/- 15 Ma) and Telen (2126 +/- 16 Ma), suggesting partial reworking of the basement of a 2.5 Ga micro continent during ca. 1.8 Ga continental-arc magmatism. The timing of peak metamorphism is inferred to be in the range of 645.6 +/- 10.4 to 521.4 +/- 12.0 Ma based on Pb-206/U-238 weighted mean ages of metamorphic zircon grains. The results of this study, together with the available magmatic ages as well as geophysical and lithological data from the region, suggest that the LHC can be divided into three units: Neoarchean (ca. 2.5 Ga) unit in the southern LHC (Shirase Orthogneiss or "Shirase microcontinent"), Neoproterozoic (ca. 1.0 Ga) unit in the northern LHC, and supracrustal unit in the central LHC with fragments of Paleoproterozoic (ca. 1.8 Ga) and minor Neoarchean (ca. 2.5 Ga) and Neoproterozoic (ca. 1.0 Ga) magmatic arcs. The 1.8 Ga arc magmatism inferred in this study has also been reported from adjacent Gondwana fragments such as the Highland Complex in Sri Lanka, and the Trivandrum and Nagercoil Blocks in southern India. Although the ca. 1.8 Ga arc-magmatic event is coeval in these regions, the Paleoproterozoic supracrustal unit in the central LHC may not be contiguous with those in the Highland Complex of Sri Lanka because recent studies have shown that the Vijayan Complex in Sri Lanka and the ca. 1.0 Ga northern LHC possibly were part of a single crustal unit (northern Liitzow-Holm-Vijayan Complex) within the Kalahari Block. The supracrustal unit possibly marks part of a discrete suture formed by the collision of the ca. 2.5 Ga southern LHC (Shirase microcontinent) and the ca. 1.0 Ga northern Liitzow-Holm-Vijayan Complex during the latest Neoproterozoic-Cambrian Gondwana amalgamation, which might be coeval with the collision of the Vijayan and Wanni Complexes and the formation of the Highland Complex in Sri Lanka.
   Our study provides new insights on crustal growth and terrane assembly in the ancient continental blocks of Gondwana.

AB During Indo-Antarctic collision at c. 1.0 Ga, Eastern Ghats Province (EGP) granulites amalgamated with the Archean Indian craton. The northern boundary of the EGP was subsequently reworked, undergoing dextral strike-slip shearing at 0.5 Ga. This study documents a phase of dextral shearing within the EGP along WNW-ESE trending shear planes in c. 0.5 Ga mylonites of the Mahanadi Shear Zone. Regional structural trends in the EGP show a swing from NE-SW to the south of the shear zone, to WNW-ESE to its north. The mylonitic shear zone foliation has a sub-horizontal lineation associated with a prominent dextral shear sense in near-horizontal sections. Electron Back Scatter Diffraction (EBSD) studies on quartz confirm that mylonitisation was associated with dextral strike-slip movement in the greenschist facies. North of the Mahanadi Shear Zone, strain was partitioned into narrow dextral strike-slip shear zones along which the older granulite fabrics were transposed parallel to later WNW-ESE trending shear planes at lower grades of metamorphism. This regional-scale shearing at similar to 500 Ma possibly resulted in a significant dextral shift of the northern EGP with respect to the south. The shear zone was reactivated in the Permian time during deposition of Gondwana sediments in the Mahanadi basin.

AB The Ib-River Basin situated in the east coastal area of India, in Odisha State is a south-eastern part of the Mahanadi Master Basin. A large number of plant macrofossils belonging to the Glossopteris flora were described and documented between 2006 and 2010 from various localities of the Barakar and Lower Kamthi formations of this basin. The floral components representing leaves, roots and fructifications in these assemblages belong to the Lycopodiales, Equisetales, Sphenophyllales, Filicales, Cordaitales, Cycadales, Ginkgoales, Coniferales and Glossopteridales. In the present study, all the available data pertaining to the biological remains, petrological analyses as well as the geology of this basin are reviewed and analyzed to deduce and reconstruct the biostratigraphy, palaeoclimate, palaeoenvironment and the landscape of this basin during Permian time in general and during the deposition of Barakar (Artinskian - Kungurian) and Lower Kamthi (Lopingian) formations in particular. The floral composition suggests the prevalence of a temperate climate with a slight change from warm moist to warm dry conditions during the deposition of the Barakar Formation and warm and humid during the deposition of Lower Kamthi sediments. Distribution of various plant groups in the Barakar and Lower Kamthi formations have been shown to depict the biodiversity trends. Vegetational reconstructions during the deposition of the Barakar and Lower Kamthi formations around the Ib-River Basin have also been attempted based on all the fossil records from this area. The status of unclassified Barakar and Kamthi formations has been redefined. Apart from megafloristics, the palynology of the basin is also discussed. Possible marine incursions and marine marginal environment in the Ib-Basin during Permian are overtly summarized on the basis of records of acritarchs, typical marine ichnofossils and evidences of wave activity in Lower Gondwana sediments of this Basin.

AB The time-bound crustal evolution and subsequent deformation of the Cuddapah basin, Nellore Schist Belt and Eastern Ghats terrain of Eastern Dharwar Craton, which have undergone sustained geodynamic upheavals since almost 2.0 billion years, remain enigmatic. An attempt is made here to integrate newly available potential field data and other geophysical anomalies with deep seismic structure, to examine the generative mechanism of major crustal features, associated with this sector. Our study indicates that the initial extent of the Cuddapah basin sedimentation may have been much larger, extending by almost 50-60 km west of Tadipatri during Paleoproterozoic period, which subsequently shrank due to massive erosion following thermal uplift, caused by SW Cuddapah mantle plume. Below this region, crust is still quite warm with Moho temperatures exceeding 500 degrees C. Similarly, Nallamalai Fold Belt rocks, bounded by two major faults and extremely low gravity, may have occupied a large terrain in western Cuddapah basin also, before their abrasion. No geophysical signatures of thrusting are presently seen below this region, and thus it could not be an alien terrain either. In contrast, Nellore Schist Belt is associated with strikingly high positive gravity, possibly caused by a conspicuous horst structure and up dipping mafic crustal layers underneath, that resulted due to India-east Antarctica collision after the cessation of prolonged subduction (1.6-0.95 Ga). Further, the crustal seismic and gravity signatures would confirm presence of a totally distinct geological terrain east of the Cuddapah basin, but the trace of Eastern Ghats Belt is all together missing. Instead, all the geophysical signatures, point out to presence of a Proterozoic sedimentary terrain, east of Nellore Schist Belt. It is likely that the extent of Prorerozoic sedimentation was much larger than thought today. In addition, presence of a seismically detected Gondwana basin over Nellore Schist Belt, apart from some recently discovered similar subsurface Gondwana occurrences in intracratonic parts, would indicate that Dharwar Craton was rifting even during Gondwana period, thereby challenging the long held view of cratonic stability.

AB It has long been recognised that Madagascar was contiguous with India until the Late Cretaceous. However, the timing and nature of the amalgamation of these two regions remain highly contentious as is the location of Madagascar against India in Gondwana. Here we address these issues with new U-Pb and Lu-Hf zircon data from five metasedimentary samples from the Karwar Block of India and new Lu-Hf data from eight previously dated igneous rocks from central Madagascar and the Antongil-Masora domains of eastern Madagascar. New U-Pb data from Karwar-region detrital zircon grains yield two dominant age peaks at c. 3100 Ma and c. 2500 Ma. The c. 3100 Ma population has relatively juvenile epsilon(Hf)(t) values that trend toward an evolved signature at c. 2500 Ma. The c. 2500 Ma population shows a wide range of epsilon(Hf)(t) values reflecting mixing of an evolved source with a juvenile source at that time. These data, and the new Lu-Hf data from Madagascar, are compared with our new compilation of over 7000 U-Pb and 1000 Lu-Hf analyses from Madagascar and India. We have used multidimensional scaling to assess similarities in these data in a statistically robust way. We propose that the Karwar Block of western peninsular India is an extension of the western Dharwar Craton and not part of the Antananarivo Domain of Madagascar as has been suggested in some models. Based on epsilon(Hf)(t) signatures we also suggest that India (and the Antongil-Masora domains of Madagascar) were palaeogeographically isolated from central Madagascar (the Antananarivo Domain) during the Palaeoproterozoic. This supports a model where central Madagascar and India amalgamated during the Neoproterozoic along the Betsimisaraka Suture.

AB The Bangalore and Harohalli dyke swarms occur in the eastern part of the Dharwar craton. The older Bangalore dyke swarm is made up of dolerites, trending east-west, and the younger contains alkaline dykes that trend approximately north-south. The lamprophyres of the Harohalli dyke swarm occur in the Halaguru and Mysore industrial areas where they are exposed as fresh porphyritic - panidiomorphic dykes, containing crustal xenoliths, and showing chilled contacts with the country rock charnokites. They are chiefly composed of amphiboles which form well-developed phenocrysts. Clinopyroxenes are present in some of the dykes. Compositional zoning is observed in clinopyroxenes and amphiboles; their zoning patterns indicate that the magma experienced cryptic variations and that fractional crystallization was a dominant process in the evolution of the Harohalli Lamprophyres (HRL).
   The HRL are calc-alkaline with shoshonitic affinity and exhibit a K2O/Na2O ratio of similar to 1. They show primitive (MORB-like) trace-element characters. LILE and LREE both show marginally enriched patterns; whereas HFSE and HREE show strongly depleted patterns. In the regional geologic sense, HRL dykes are characterised by two major influences; namely, (i) primary source region characteristics, which are geochemically more primitive, roughly falling within fields of primitive - MORB and enriched- MORE and (ii) the continental lithosphere. The data points for the HRL distinctly show their proximity to N-MORB and scatter towards the continental crust. Moreover, features like xenolith assimilation might influence the trace-element characteristics of the HRL dykes. Such magmas with mixed characters can be formed in a backarc basin environment. Geochemical proxies such as Ba/Nb vs Nb/Yb, Ba/Th vs Th/Nb, and the water content of magmas; which have been effectively used for discriminating backarc basin magmas worldwide, also indicate that the HRL magmas were generated in a backarc environment with inputs from a shallow subduction component and interaction with carbonatite melt. This paper therefore presents a new provenance for the generation of calc-alkaline lamprophyres, which were so far known to occur in orogenic belts.

AB First palynological data, supplemented by detrital zircon U-Pb ages, from the Fenestella Shale Formation near the Gund Village in the Banihal area of Jammu and Kashmir State, India, provide new insights into the floristic evolution of Gondwana during the Late Palaeozoic, especially in India, from where the Carboniferous-Permian macro- and microfloral records are impoverished. We also present a first approach to the palynological correlation of the Carboniferous-Permian palynoassemblages described from the various Gondwana countries. The palynomorphs from the Fenestella Shale Formation are fairly well preserved and diversified and include 11 genera and 18 species. While the trilete spores and striate bisaccate pollen grains are scarce, monosaccate pollen taxa mainly - Parasaccites, PlicatipoUenites and Potonieisporites are dominant. The assemblage is most similar to the Parasaccites korbaensis palynozone of the Lower Gondwana basins of the Indian peninsula and the Stage 2 palynozone of the late Carboniferous of east Australia. Besides, it is comparable with the known Carboniferous assemblages of Pakistan, Yemen and South America; Carboniferous-early Permian assemblages of South Africa and Permian assemblages of Antarctica. The sediment source of the siliciclastic shelf and delta deposits intercalated in the Fenestella Shale Formation is a hinterland in which Precambrian rocks dominantly were exposed and the Th-U ratios of detrital zircons suggest, that most rocks exposed on the erosion level in the hinterland had a felsic composition. The youngest U-Pb zircon age of the investigated fossiliferous strata is 329 +/- 16 Ma (late Visean to early Serpukhovian), providing a maximum age of deposition of the studied succession. Based on the affinities of the palynofloral assemblage and earlier palaeontological records, a warm, temperate and arid climate has been inferred for the Fenestella Shale Formation.

AB The distribution and changing pattern of stromatolites in the Vempalle Formation of the Cuddapah Basin, India, have been investigated with emphasis on external morphologies, internal fabrics, growth patterns and sediment associations. The stromatolitic limestone occurs in a low angle ramp type carbonate platform, with complete exposures from shallow shelf to basinal fades, provides record of changes in reef-building capacity of stromatolites with change in the depositional milieu. Changing pattern and style of the stromatolites clearly reflect depth partitioned growth of the microbial community. Small and scattered stromatolites, commonly with wavy parallel laminations or stratifications occurred in inner-ramp settings, where they are build up to the sea level. Tepee structure and desiccation cracks in associated sediments and salt pseudomorphs point to shallow water to occasional exposure condition. Large bioherms with columnar and conical stromatolites developed in the headland (mid ramp), which were in continuous interaction with strong waves of the open sea. Growth of the bioherms changed the landform with time and generated a high sloping edge with a sheer drop that extended out into the sea, forming distally steepened ramp. Outer ramp lithofacies characterized by thick layers of shale succession with thin beds of laterally persistent stromatolitic beds with low synoptic relief build-ups. These biotic components, along with the absence of wave-related structures, place the outer ramp below the base of wave action zone. Ooid banks developed in the mid ramp area are in the high surfing zone. High flux of nutrients and high-light show positive correlation; thus the high growth pattern is best observed within the photic zone where wave action is maximum. The ability to change from low synoptic relief algal laminites to high synoptic relief columnar stromatolites point to their adaptive power. The key factor that controlled the shape of these Palaeoproterozoic stromatolites is the dynamic interactions between mat growth, currents and sediment supply. Presence of concentric and radial fibrous ooids indicates change in climate and salinity of the sea.

TI Depositional environments, provenance and paleoclimatic implications of
   Ordovician siliciclastic rocks of the Thango Formation, Spiti Valley,

AB Recently published findings indicate that the Ordovician period has been much more dynamic than previously anticipated thus making this period significant in geological time. The Ordovician of India can best be studied in the Spiti region because the Spiti basin records the complete uninterrupted history of excellent marine sedimentary rocks starting from Cambrian to Paleogene which were deposited along the northern margin of India. Due to these reasons the geochemical data on the Ordovician rocks from the Spiti region is uncommon. The present geochemical study on the Ordovician Thango Formation (Sanugba Group) is mainly aimed to understand the provenance and the paleoclimatic conditions. The sandstones are the dominant lithology of the Thango Formation with intercalations of minor amount of shales. Detailed petrographic and sedimentological analysis of these rocks suggest that three major depositional environments, viz., fluvial, transitional and marine prevailed in the basin representing transgressive and regressive phases. The major and trace element ratios such as Si02/ Al2O3, K2O/Na2O and La-Th- Sc discrimination diagram suggest that these rocks were deposited in passive margin tectonic settings. Various geochemical discriminants and elemental ratios such as K2O/Na2O, Al2O3/TiO2, La/Sc, Th/Sc, Cr/Th, Zr/Sc, (Gd/Yb)(N) and pronounced negative Eu anomalies indicate the rocks to be the product of weathering of post-Archean granites. The striking similarities of the multi-elemental spider diagrams of the studied sediments and the Himalayan granitoids indicate that sediments are sourced from the Proterozoic orogenic belts of the Himalayan region. Chemical index of alteration (CIA) values of the studied sediments (55-72) suggest that the source rocks underwent low to moderate degree of chemical weathering. The span of the CIA values (55-72) recorded in the sediments from the Spiti region may have resulted from varying degrees of weathering conditions in the source area. This, in turn, reflects variable climatic conditions prevailing during the Ordovician period, which is consistent with the global studies. The high CIA values observed by numerous studies on siliciclastic sediments may imply warm paleoclimate attributed to an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide and/or methane levels inducing an acidic weathering environment and enhanced silicate weathering. While the low CIA values indicates prevalence of arid-glacial conditions where negligible chemical alteration is possible. This study documents the noteworthy events like fluctuating (rise and fall) atmospheric CO2 and sea levels during the Ordovician period, a conclusion which is consistent with the other such studies on the Phanerozoic glaciation (or mass extinction) events on Gondwana supercontinent.

AB Aim: The genetic variants of the factor V (G1691A), prothrombin (G20210A) and MTHFR (C677T) genes have been widely implicated as inherited risk factors for developing venous thrombosis. This study was undertaken to reveal the frequency of these mutations in Kashmiri patients with venous thromboembolism.
   Methodology: A case-control study was designed with 250 VTE patients and 250 healthy controls. The mutations were analysed using ARMS-PCR and PCR-RFLP approach.
   Result: The factor V Leiden G1691A mutation was found in 17/250 (6.8%) VTE patients and prothrombin G20210A mutation was found in 7/250 (2.8%) VTE patients while no mutation was found in any of the healthy controls. Both the mutations were found to be significantly associated with the increased risk of VTE (p = 0.0001 and 0.0150 respectively) while no association of VTE risk with MTHFR C677T polymorphism was found (p = 0.53).
   Conclusion: The increased frequency of factor V Leiden G1691A and prothrombin G20210A mutation in VTE patients indicates a significant role of these mutations in the development of VTE in our population. We therefore suggest the routine screening of these two mutations as thrombophilic markers in Kashmiri patients with venous thromboembolism.

AB Aggressive behavior represents an important public concern and a clinical challenge to behaviorists and psychiatrists. Aggression in humans is known to have an important genetic basis, so to investigate the association of Y chromosome short tandem repeat (Y-STR) loci with initiative-aggressive behavior, we compared allelic and haplotypic distributions of 22 Y-STRs in a group of Chinese males convicted of premeditated extremely violent crimes (n = 271) with a normal control group (n = 492). Allelic distributions of DYS533 and DYS437 loci differed significantly between the two groups (P <. 0.05). The case group had higher frequencies of DYS533 allele 14, DYS437 allele 14, and haplotypes 11-14 of DYS533-DYS437 compared with the control group. Additionally, the DYS437 allele 15 frequency was significantly lower in cases than controls. No frequency differences were observed in the other 20 Y-STR loci between these two groups. Our results indicate a genetic role for Y-STR loci in the development of initiative aggression in non-psychiatric subjects.

AB The SGMS1 gene encodes the enzyme sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SMS1), which is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism, apoptosis, intracellular vesicular transport and other significant processes. The SGMS1 gene is located on chromosome 10 and has a size of 320 kb. Previously, we showed that dozens of alternative transcripts of the SGMS1 gene are present in various human tissues. In addition to mRNAs that provide synthesis of the SMS1 protein, this gene participates in the synthesis of non-coding transcripts, including circular RNAs (circRNAs), which include exons of the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) and are highly represented in the brain. In this study, using the high-throughput technology RNA-CaptureSeq, many new SGMS1 transcripts were identified, including both intronic unspliced RNAs (premature RNAs) and RNAs formed via alternative splicing. Recursive exons (RS-exons) that can participate in the multi-step splicing of long introns of the gene were also identified. These exons participate in the formation of circRNAs. Thus, multi-step splicing may provide a variety of linear and circular RNAs of eukaryotic genes in tissues.

AB Retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR) are ligand-mediated transcription factors that synchronize intricate signaling networks in metazoans. Dimer formation between these two nuclear receptors mediates the recruitment of co-regulatory complexes coordinating the progression of signaling cascades during developmental and regenerative events. In the present study we identified and characterized the receptors for retinoic acid in the sea cucumber Holothuria glaberrima; a model system capable of regenerative organogenesis during adulthood. Molecular characterizations revealed the presence of three isoforms of RAR and two of RXR as a consequence of alternative splicing events. Various analyses including: primary structure sequencing, phylogenetic analysis, protein domain prediction, and multiple sequence alignment further confirmed their identity. Semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis of each receptor isoform herein identified showed that the retinoid receptors are expressed in all tissues sampled: the mesenteries, respiratory trees, muscles, gonads, and the digestive tract. During regenerative organogenesis two of the receptors (RAR-L and RXR-T) showed differential expression in the posterior segment while RAR-S is differentially expressed in the anterior segment of the intestine. This work presents the first description of the components relaying the signaling for retinoic acid within this model system.

AB Among the many candidate genes analyzed in eating disorder (ED) patients, those involved in dopaminergic functions may be of special relevance, as dopamine is known to play a significant role in feeding behavior, the distortion of body image, hyperactivity and reward and reinforcement processes. We aimed to determine the effect of functional polymorphisms and haplotypes in the Dopamine Receptor D4 (DRD4) gene on general psychopathological symptoms in ED patients. Two-hundred-and-seventy-three ED patients [199 with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) and 74 with Bulimia Nervosa (BN)] completed the SCL-90R inventory and were genotyped for four functional, clinically relevant DRD4 polymorphisms: three variants in the promoter region [120-bp tandem repeat (TR, long vs. short allele), C-616G and C-521 T] and a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in exon 3 (7R vs. non-7R allele). After correcting for multiple testing, none of the assayed polymorphisms were individually associated with SCL-90R results. Four DRD4 haplotypes (*1-*4) were detected in the patients with a frequency > 0.1. In the BN group, haplotype *2 (non7R-TR long-C-C) was associated with higher scores in the three global SCL-90R indices (GSI, PSDI and PST) after Bonferroni correction (p <= 0.01 in all instances). Furthermore, carriers of this haplotype displayed higher scores (worst symptomatology) in Somatization, Obsessive-Compulsive, Anxiety, Phobic anxiety, Paranoid ideation and the test additional items (p-values for the differences between carriers vs. non-carriers ranging from 0.0001 to 0.0110). Certain combinations of DRD4 variants may contribute to psychopathological features in BN patients.

AB Chromobox protein homolog 3 (CBX3), a core component of the heterochromatin proteins 1, is recently proved to be involved in human cancerogenesis and associated with the prognosis of patient. However, the role of CBX3 in Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) remains unclear. In the present study we found that CBX3 was upregulated in TSCC tissues when compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues, and multivariable analysis showed that high CBX3 expression was associated with clinical stage and cervical node metastasis, which was an independent prognostic indicator of TSCC. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test showed that TSCC patients with high CBX3 expression had a poorer rate of OS compared to patients with low CBX3 expression. Moreover, knocking down CBX3 inhibited TSCC cells proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, while overexpressing CBX3 promoted TSCC cells proliferation. In addition, CBX3 depletion resulted in cell cycle delay at the G1/S phase via the p21 pathway. In summary, we identifies CBX3 as a potential novel oncogene in TSCC, which may act as a biomarker and target in the diagnosis and treatment of this killer disease.

AB Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis (RAS) is a common oral inflammatory disease with unknown pathogenesis. Although the immune system alterations could be involved in predisposition of individuals to oral candidiasis, precise etiologies of RAS have not been understood yet. A recent study showed that autosomal dominant IL17F deficiency could cause chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. Considering the inflammatory nature of interleukin (IL)-17F and RAS, this study was performed to check any disease-associated mutation in a number of patients with RAS. Sixty-two Iranian individuals with RAS were investigated in this study. After DNA extraction using a phenol-chloroform method from the whole blood, amplification was accomplished by polymerase chain reaction and the products were sequenced using a 3730 ABI sequencer. The results of sequencing revealed a missense, heterozygous mutation of IL17F, converting a threonine to praline in a patient with RAS (T79P). The Poly-phen software suggested a damaging probability predicting this substitution to have a harmful effect on IL-17F protein function. This mutation was checked in fifty healthy individuals, and was not detected in any of them. This is the first study showing that a mutation in IL-17F is associated with susceptibility to RAS. However, functional studies and further studies on more patients with RAS are required to confirm such association.

AB Sapium sebiferum (L.) Roxb [S. sebiferum L.] is not only one of the most important economic woody oil trees, but is also a significant traditional herbal medicine in China. The CONSTANS (CO) gene is a key regulator of the long day-dependent flowering pathway in Arabidopsis and other plants. To gain insight into the role of CO in woody oil trees, SsCO from S. sebiferum L. was isolated and characterized in this study. The corresponding SsCO protein, with 340 amino acid residues, included two putative zinc finger motifs B-Box1 and B-Box2 in the N-terminal region and a conserved CCT domain in the C-terminal region. SsCO expression was high in flowers and exhibited distinct circadian regulation. In addition, SsCO had a transcriptional activation effect in yeast strains. Moreover, heterologous expression of SsCO complemented the late-flowering phenotype of the Arabidopsis CO mutant co-1. These results indicate that SsCO is a transcription factor and may regulate the photoperiodic flowering time and SsCO is regulated by circadian rhythms in Sapium sebiferum L.

AB Tumor cells recruit vascular endothelial cells and circulating endothelial progenitor cells to form new vessels to support their own growth and metastasis. VEGF, PDGF-BB and FGF-2 are three major pro-angiogenic factors and applied to promote angiogenesis. In this research, we demonstrated that anlotinib, a potent multi-tyrosine kinases inhibitor (TKI), showed a significant inhibitory effect on VEGF/PDGF-BB/FGF-2-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Wound healing assay, chamber directional migration assay and tube formation assay indicated that anlotinib inhibited VEGF/PDGF-BB/FGF-2-induced cell migration and formation of capillary-like tubes in endothelial cells. Furthermore, anlotinib suppressed blood vessels sprout and microvessel density in rat aortic ring assay and chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Importantly, according to our study, the anti-angiogenic effect of anlotinib is superior to sunitinib, sorafenib and nintedanib, which are three main anti-angiogenesis drugs in clinic. Mechanistically, anlotinib inhibits the activation of VEGFR2, PDGFR beta and FGFR1 as well their common downstream ERIC signaling. Therefore, anlotinib is a potential agent to inhibit angiogenesis and be applied to tumor therapy.

AB Generation of new beta cells is an important approach in the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus (type 1 DM). Adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) might be one of the best sources for cell replacement therapy for diabetes. Therefore, this work aimed to test the possible role of transplanted insulin-producing cells (IPCs) differentiated from ADSCs in treatment of streptozotocin (STZ) induced type I DM in rats. Type 1 DM was induced by single intra peritoneal injection with STZ (50 mg/kg BW). Half of the diabetic rats were left without treatment and the other half were injected with differentiated IPCs directly into the pancreas. ADSCs were harvested, cultured and identified by testing their phenotypes through flow cytometry. They were further subjected to differentiation into IPCs using differentiation medium. mRNA expression of pancreatic transcription factors (pdx1), insulin and glucose transporter-2 genes by real time PCR was done to detect the cellular differentiation and confirmed by stimulated insulin secretion. The pancreatic tissues from all groups were examined 2 months after IPC transplantation and were subjected to histological, Immunohistochemical and morphometric study. The differentiated IPCs showed significant expression of pancreatic beta cell markers and insulin secretion in glucose dependent manner. Treatment with IPCs induced apparent regeneration, diffused proliferated islet cells and significant increase in C-peptide immune reaction. We concluded that transplantation of differentiated IPCs improved function and morphology of Islet cells in diabetic rats. Consequently, this therapy option may be a promising therapeutic approach to patient with type 1 DM if proven to be effective and safe.

AB Purpose: The present study aimed to elucidate the pathogenesis of colon cancer and identify genes associated with tumor development.
   Methods: Three datasets, two (GSE74602 and GSE44861) from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and RNA-Seq colon cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas data portal, were downloaded. These three datasets were grouped using a meta-analysis approach, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between colon tumor samples and adjacent normal samples. Functional enrichment analysis and regulatory factor predication were performed for significant genes. Additionally, small-molecule drugs associated with colon cancer were predicted, and a prognostic risk model was constructed.
   Results: There were 251 overlapping DEGs (135 up- and 116 downregulated) between cancer samples and control samples in the three datasets. The DEGs were mainly involved in protein transport and apoptotic and neurotrophin signaling pathways. A total of 70 small-molecule drugs were predicated to be associated with colon cancer. Additionally, in the miRNA-target regulatory network, we found that SLC44A1 can be targeted by hsa-miR-183, hsa-miR-206, and hsa-miR-147, while KLF13 can be regulated by hsa-miR-182, hsa-miR-206, and hsa-miR-153. Moreover, the results of the prognostic risk model showed that four genes (VAMP1, P2RX5, CACNB1, and CRY2) could divide the samples into high and low risk groups.
   Conclusion: SLC44A1 and KLF13 may be involved in tumorigenesis and the metastasis of colon cancer by miRNA regulation. In addition, a four-gene (VAMP1, P2RX5, CACNB1, and CRY2) expression signature may have prognostic and predictive value in colon cancer.

AB Objective: This study aims to investigate the HPV16 variant distribution by sequence analyses of E6, E7 oncogenes and the Long Control Region (LCR), from cervical cells collected from Uruguayan women, and to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among variants.
   Methods: Forty-seven HPV16 variants, obtained from women with HSIL, LSIL, ASCUS and NILM cytological classes were analyzed for LCR and 12 were further studied for E6 and E7. Detailed sequence comparison, genetic heterogeneity analyses and phylogenetic reconstruction were performed.
   Results: A high variability was observed among LCR sequences, which were distributed in 18 different variants. E6 and E7 sequences exhibited novel non-synonymous substitutions. Uruguayan sequences mainly belonged to the European lineage, and only 5 sequences clustered in non-European branches; 3 of them in the Asian-American and North-American linage and 2 in an African branch. Additionally, 6 new variants from European and African clusters were identified.
   Conclusions: HPV16 isolates mainly belonged to the European lineage, though strains from African and Asian-American lineages were also identified. Herein is reported for the first time the distribution and molecular characterization of HPV16 variants from Uruguay, providing novel insights on the molecular epidemiology of this infectious disease in the South America.
   Synopsis: A high variability among HPV 16 isolates mainly belonged to European lineage, provides an extensive sequence dataset from a country with high burden of cervical cancer.

AB Background: Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder mainly characterized by cutaneous poikiloderma, sparse hair, short stature and skeletal defects. Deleterious mutations in the RecQ-like DNA helicase type 4 (RECQL4) gene have been detected in approximately two-thirds of RTS cases.
   Methods: Three Chinese patients from two unrelated families were enrolled for clinical evaluation. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) using a custom panel consisting of 705 short-stature-related genes was performed for the probands. Variants detected by NGS were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and examined in family members.
   Results: The probands presented with characteristic features of severe growth delay, poikiloderma mostly on the face, buttocks and extremities, sparse or absent hair, eyelashes, and eyebrows, forearm reduction defects, small hands with hypoplasia of the middle phalanx (little finger) in one of the probands, epicanthus, hypertelorism, and dental abnormalities. In addition, novel auricle features and other rare facial features, including narrow palpebral fissure, depressed nasal bridge, and small chin were exhibited. Four novel RECQL4 variants were identified, including three pathogenic frameshift variants, c.1724_1725delAC, p.His575fs*7; c.2421dupT, p.Asp808*; c.1770_1807del, p.Pro591fs*2, and one likely pathogenic missense variant, c.691G > A, p.Gly231Ser.
   Conclusion: Our study expands the mutational spectrum of RECQL4 gene and reveals novel phenotypes observed in Chinese RTS patients.

AB We have characterized the full-length vasa cDNA from Jundia, Rhamdia quelen (Heptapteridae, Siluriformes). vasa encodes a member of the DEAD-box protein family of ATP-dependent RNA helicases. This protein is highly conserved among different organisms and its role is associated with RNA metabolism. In the majority of the investigated species, vasa is restricted to the germ cell lineage and its expression has been used to study germline development in many organisms, including fish. The deduced R. quelen vasa amino acid sequence displayed high similarity with Vasa protein sequences from other organisms, and did not cluster with PL10 or P68 DEAD-box protein subfamilies. We also reported that there is no other isoform for vasa mRNA in R. quelen gonads. Expression analysis by RT-PCR and qPCR showed vasa transcripts exclusively expressed in the germ cells of R. quelen gonads. R. quelen vasa mRNA was maternally inherited, and was detected in the migrating primordial germ cells (PGCs) until 264 h post-fertilization during embryonic and larval development. This work has characterized for the first time the full-length R. quelen vasa cDNA, and describes its expression patterns during R. quelen embryonic and larval development. Our results will contribute to the basic reproductive biology of this native species, and will support studies using vasa as a germ cell marker in different biotechnological studies, such as germ cell transplantation.

AB The crosstalk between fetus and mother starts with the onset of placental attachment to the uterus. The cotyledons and caruncles are the two anatomically distinct structures that play a crucial role in this physiological communication. Using Agilent Gene Chip Genome microarray, we measured the expression profile of pregnancy cotyledons in comparison to caruncular reminiscence of the uteri in non-pregnant buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) for the detection of the early post pregnancy rapid changes in cellular expression of mRNA transcripts. We identified a total of 497 up- and 578 down-regulated genes with < 0.05 the FDR corrected p-values using 4 replicates in each group (cotyledons and caruncles) and their role in pregnancy. Deep bioinformatics analysis of data revealed the cluster of genes involved at the placentome level for various functions such as fetus attachment, transport of nutrition, and immune response. Importantly, the pathways like Hedgehog/Calcium/Wnt signalling, cell cycle regulation and immune responses regulatory functions were highly enriched by the differentially identified genes. A very highly up-regulated IL-2 specific gene showed the role of interleukin-2 signalling in the attachment of the embryo. It was observed that the genes responsible for immune response were downregulated, suggesting an immune suppressive environment which is required to adopt the semiallogeneic fetus for a successful pregnancy. To further evaluate and validate the data, we have performed qRT-PCR analysis of twenty-one genes. The present study highlights the repertoire of active transcripts in the junction of cotyledons and caruncles, which are essential for a successful onset and completion of pregnancy.

AB Changes in bacterial concentration and composition in drinking water during distribution are often attributed to biological (in)stability. Here we assessed temporal biological stability in a full-scale distribution network (DN) supplied with different types of source water: treated and chlorinated surface water and chlorinated groundwater produced at three water treatment plants (WTP). Monitoring was performed weekly during 12 months in two locations in the DN. Flow cytometric total and intact cell concentration (ICC) measurements showed considerable seasonal fluctuations, which were different for two locations. ICC varied between 0.1-3.75 x 10(5) cells mL(-1) and 0.69-4.37 x 10(5) cells mL(-1) at two locations respectively, with ICC increases attributed to temperature-dependent bacterial growth during distribution. Chlorinated water from the different WTP was further analysed with a modified growth potential method, identifying primary and secondary growth limiting compounds. It was observed that bacterial growth in the surface water sample after chlorination was primarily inhibited by phosphorus limitation and secondly by organic carbon limitation, while carbon was limiting in the chlorinated groundwater samples. However, the ratio of available nutrients changed during distribution, and together with disinfection residual decay, this resulted in higher bacterial growth potential detected in the DN than at the WTP. In this study, bacterial growth was found to be higher (i) at higher water temperatures, (ii) in samples with lower chlorine residuals and (iii) in samples with less nutrient (carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen, iron) limitation, while this was significantly different between the samples of different origin. Thus drinking water microbiological quality and biological stability could change during different seasons, and the extent of these changes depends on water temperature, the water source and treatment. Furthermore, differences in primary growth limiting nutrients in different water sources could contribute to biological instability in the network, where mixing occurs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Polyphenols are chemicals that primarily inhibit the growth of various autotrophic organisms. The presence of these metabolites greatly boosts the ecological dominance of eg. Cladophora, which creates large surface mats. The main goal of our work was to quantify the phenol and polyphenols (allelopathic substances) secreted by the macroalgae as a result of exposure to biotic stress caused by competition. The research was carried out on the Cladophora glomerata biomass collected from two freshwater ecosystems located in Wielkopolska Region (Poland, Fig. 1): Oporzynskie Lake (N52 degrees 55', E 17 degrees 9') and Nielba River (N52 degrees 48', E 17 degrees 12'). Seasonal variability (May-October 2015) in the properties of C. glomerata mats in the river and lake ecosystem was also analyzed in relation to the physicochemical parameters of water. In addition, the content of pigments in the analyzed biomass was determined during the appearance of algae mats in water reservoirs. Biomass extraction was performed to determine the phenolic and carotenoid contents (chlorophyll and carotenoids) by using two extraction methods: microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE). After isolation of the phenols from the thalli (mats) and the habitat, they were analyzed using the Folin-Ciocalteu method with some modifications, while the pigment content (chlorophyll and carotenoids) was evaluated by the spectrophotometric method Liechtenthaler (1987) with some variations. Analysis of the content of these components in algae extracts indicates that the tendency of changes in their contents was similar or the same. Growth and decrease of phenolic content (Cladophora T MAE and Cladophora T SFE) and pigments (MAE chlorophyll, SFE and MAE carotenoids) at the same time were independent of the insulation method used. The mats formed by C. glomerata on the surface of Lake Oporzynskie were more stable and larger surface area than those on the Nielba River, which could explain differences in polyphenol concentrations in these two aquatic ecosystems. The results suggest a reduction in the secretion of phenolic compounds with an aging population of algae. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A highly settleable microalga, Ettlia sp., was applied to a freshwater recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) of Danio rerio to improve the treatment of nitrogenous compounds. The growth characteristics of the microalgae, water quality parameters, and bacterial communities were monitored for 73 days. In the treatment RAS, the inoculated Ettlia sp. grew up to 1.26 g/L and dominated (>99%) throughout the experiment, whereas naturally occurring microalgae grew to 0.57 g/L in the control RAS. The nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium concentrations in the treatment RAS were reduced by 50.1%, 73.3%, and 24.2%, respectively, compared to the control RAS. A bacterial community analysis showed that Rhodospirillales, Phycisphaerae, Chlorobiales, and Burkholderiales were the major bacterial groups in the later phase of the treatment RAS. Meanwhile, a network analysis among the Ettlia sp., bacterial groups, and environmental parameters, revealed that the bacterial groups played key roles in both water quality improvement and Ettlia sp. growth. In conclusion, the inoculation and growth of the Ettlia sp. and its associated bacteria in the RAS produced beneficial effects on the water quality by reducing the nitrogenous compounds and providing a favorable environment for certain bacterial groups to further improve water quality.

AB Like many regions around the world, New York State, USA, faces challenges in meeting wastewater treatment quality standards because of aging infrastructure, limited funding, shifting demographics and increasingly stringent environmental regulations. In recent decades construction of new wastewater treatment and distribution infrastructure in NY has most often occurred in exurban communities and suburban developments that are less dense than traditional urban cores. Here, we examine the role of size and capacity utilization on wastewater treatment effectiveness with respect to critical effluent parameters, and additionally explore which common facility engineering controls influence water quality treatment using a unique dataset of descriptive information. Our results challenge conventional wisdom, suggesting that the largest facilities (>30,000 m(3)/d), not the smallest (<300 m(3)/d), discharge TSS, BOD, and coliform at significantly higher relative effluent concentrations (i.e., the ratio of discharged concentrations to allowable limits). Capacity utilization was also positively correlated to higher concentrations of TSS, BOD, and coliform effluent concentrations in larger facilities, though those concentrations were often within regulated limits. This implies that smaller-sized facilities may perform better in terms of environmental quality, but that the largest facilities demonstrate efficiency in the sense that they are not "over-treating" wastewater while avoiding violations. Results from NY suggest that medium sized facilities (300-30,000 m(3)/d) are sophisticated enough to incorporate appropriate unit processes, and employ operators with sufficient training and oversight, to reach treatment outcomes that are both reliable and of high quality.

ID MECHANISMS; MANAGEMENT
AB The accumulation of FOG (Fat, Oil and Grease) deposits in sewer pumping stations results in an increase in maintenance costs, malfunctioning of pumps and, a potential increase of wastewater spills in receiving open water bodies. It is thought that a variety of parameters (e.g. geometry of the pump sump, pump operation, socioeconomic parameters of the catchment) influences the built-up of FOG. Based on a database containing data of 126 pumping stations located in five Dutch municipalities a statistical model was built. It is shown that 3 parameters are most significant in explaining the occurrence of FOG deposits: mean income of the population in a catchment, the amount of energy (kinetic and potential) per m(3) per day and the density of restaurants, bars and hotels in a catchment. Further it is shown that there are significant differences between municipalities that can be traced back to the local 'design paradigm'. For example, in Amsterdam, the design philosophy of discharging in the pump sump under the water surface (and hence maintaining a low level of turbulence in the pump sump) results in an increase of the probability of the formation of FOG.

AB This study focuses on the effect of electrode materials on abatement of lindane (an organochlorine pesticide) by electrooxidation process. Comparative performances of different anodic (platinum (Pt), dimensionally stable anode (DSA) and boron-doped diamond (BDD)) and cathodic (carbon sponge (CS), carbon felt (CF) and stainless steel (SS)) materials on lindane electrooxidation and mineralization were investigated. Special attention was paid to determine the role of chlorine active species during the electrooxidation process. The results showed that better performances were obtained when using a BDD anode and CF cathode cell. The influence of the current density was assessed to optimize the oxidation of lindane and the mineralization of its aqueous solution. A quick (10 min) and complete oxidation of 10 mg L-1 lindane solution and relatively high mineralization degree (80% TOC removal) at 4 h electrolysis were achieved at 8.33 mA cm(-2) current density. Lindane was quickly oxidized by in-situ generated hydroxyl radicals, (M((OH)-O-center dot)), formed from oxidation of water on the anode (M) surface following pseudo first-order reaction kinetics. Formation of chlorinated and hydroxylated intermediates and carboxylic acids during the treatment were identified and a plausible mineralization pathway of lindane by hydroxyl radicals was proposed.

AB The determination of organics biodegradability and corresponding biodegradation kinetics provides valuable information on the optimal design and operation of anaerobic biotechnology especially for sulfidogenesis. This study proposes a deterministic method, i.e. a biochemical sulfide potential (BSP) test, and compares it to the conventional biochemical methane potential (BMP) test in terms of their ability to characterize sulfate-laden organic waste biodegradability. It demonstrated 1.48 times higher degradation of volatile suspended solids (VSS) and 2.60 times more chemical oxygen demand (COD) conversion in its major metabolites than the BMP test. Moreover, it required only four days to complete, compared to the 35 days required by the BMP test. Through the two-substrate first-order hydrolysis model, it was revealed that the shortened time was attributed to the enhanced degradation rates from both readily (eight times) and slowly (nearly 10 times) biodegradable organic substrates in the BSP test compared with the BMP test for the same sulfate-laden organic waste. The findings highlight the inappropriateness of the BMP test to sulfidogenic applications due to the underestimated predictions of organic waste biodegradability and excessive time requirements. Furthermore, the ability of the BSP test to identify the average elemental composition (CxHyOzNaPbSc) of substrate biodegradable particulate organics (BPO) is explored and verified using a casein-based validation test. Using BPO elemental composition as the input variable, a BSP biochemical kinetic model is thereby developed to predict BSR performance and possible dynamic process control. Overall, this study demonstrates the applicability and advantages of the BSP test in sulfidogenic applications for characterization of organics biodegradability and identification of BPO average elemental composition, furthermore develops a process model utilizing the derived BPO average elemental composition to provide optimized reactor retention time and substrates feed mixture for optimum performance.

AB Emerging pollutants, including pharmaceutical compounds, are producing water pollution problems around the world. Some pharmaceutical pollutants, which mainly reach ecosystems within wastewater discharges, are persistent in the water cycle and can also reach the food chain. This work addresses this issue, accounting the grey component of the water footprint (GWF(P)) for four of the most common pharmaceutical compounds (carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DCF), ketoprofen (KTP) and naproxen (NPX)). In addition, the GWF(C) for the main conventional pollutants is also accounted (nitrate, phosphates and organic matter). The case study is the Murcia Region of southeastern Spain, where wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) purify 99.1% of the wastewater discharges and there is an important direct reuse of the treated wastewater in irrigation. Thus, the influence of WWTPs and reuse on the GWF is analysed. The results reveal that GWF B only taking into account pharmaceutical pollutants, has a value of 301 m(3) inhabitant(-1) year(-1) considering only conventional pollutants (GWF(C)), this value increases to 4718 m(3) inhabitant(-1) year(-1) . So, the difference between these values is such that in other areas with consumption habits similar to those of the Murcia Region, and without wastewater purification, conventional pollutants may well establish the value of the GWF. On average, the WWTPs reduce the GWF(C) by 90% and the GWF(P) by 26%. These different reductions of the pollutant concentrations in the treated effluents show that the GWF is not only due to conventional pollutants, and other contaminants can became critical, such as the pharmaceutical pollutants. The reuse further reduces the value of the GWF for the Murcia Region, by around 43.6%. However, the reuse of treated wastewater is controversial, considering the pharmaceutical contaminants and their possible consequences in the food chain. In these cases, the GWF of pharmaceutical pollutants can be used to provide a first approximation of the dilution that should be applied to the treated wastewater discharges when they are reused for another economic activity that imposes quality restrictions. For the case of agriculture in the Murcia Region, the dilution required is 2 (fresh water) to 1 (treated wastewater), taking into account the pollution thresholds established in this work.

AB N-nitrosamines are a group of potent human carcinogens that can be formed during oxidative treatment of drinking water and wastewater. Many tertiary and quaternary amines present in consumer products (e.g., pharmaceuticals, personal care and household products) are known to be N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) precursors during chloramination, but the formation of other N-nitrosamines has been rarely studied. This study investigates the specific and total N-nitrosamine (TONO) formation potential (FP) of various precursors from nitrogen-containing micropollutants (chlorhexidine, metformin, benzalkonium chloride and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride) and tertiary and quaternary model amines (trimethyl amine, N,N-dimethylbutyl amine, N,N-dimethylbenzyl amine and tetramethyl ammonium). All the studied nitrogenous micropollutants displayed quantifiable TONO FP, with molar yields in the range 0.04-11.92%. However, the observed TONO pools constituted mostly of uncharacterized species, not included in US-EPA 8270 N-nitrosamines standard mix. Only the quaternary ammonium compound benzalkonium chloride showed quantifiable NDMA FP (0.56% molar yield), however, explaining only a minor fraction of the observed TONO FP. The studied model amines showed molar NDMA yields from 0.10% (trimethyl amine) to 5.05% (N,N-dimethylbenzyl amine), very similar to the molar TONO yields. The comparison of the FPs of micropollutants and model compounds showed that the presence of electron donating functional groups (such as a benzyl group) in tertiary and quaternary amine precursors leads to a higher formation of NDMA and uncharacterized N-nitrosamines, respectively. LC-qTOF screening of a list of proposed N-nitrosamine structures has enabled to identify a novel N-nitrosamine (N-nitroso-N-methyldodecylamine) from the chloramination of benzalkonium chloride. This finding supports the hypothesis that different functional groups in quaternary amines can act as leaving groups during chloramination and form differing N-nitrosamine structures at significant yield. Molar TONO yields determined for micropollutants were finally validated under experimental conditions closer to real water matrices, confirming their representativeness also for lower concentration ranges.

AB A computational method for the simulation of viscous and compressible gas-gas flows is presented. It consists in solving the Navier-Stokes equations associated with a convection equation governing the motion of the interface between two gases using high-order finite-difference schemes. A discontinuity-capturing methodology based on sensors and a spatial filter enables capturing shock waves and deformable interfaces. One-dimensional test cases are performed as validation and to justify choices in the numerical method. The results compare well with analytical solutions. Shock waves and interfaces are accurately propagated, and remain sharp. Subsequently, two-dimensional flows are considered including viscosity and thermal conductivity. In Richtmyer-Meshkov instability, generated on an air-SF6 interface, the influence of the mesh refinement on the instability shape is studied, and the temporal variations of the instability amplitude is compared with experimental data. Finally, for a plane shock wave propagating in air and impacting a cylindrical bubble filled with helium or R22, numerical Schlieren pictures obtained using different grid refinements are found to compare well with experimental shadow-photographs. The mass conservation is verified from the temporal variations of the mass of the bubble. The mean velocities of pressure waves and bubble interface are similar to those obtained experimentally.

AB The objective of this paper is to present a local bounds preserving stabilized finite element scheme for hyperbolic systems on unstructured meshes based on continuous Galerkin (CG) discretization in space. ACG semi-discrete scheme with low order artificial dissipation that satisfies the local extremum diminishing (LED) condition for systems is used to discretize a system of conservation equations in space. The low order artificial diffusion is based on approximate Riemann solvers for hyperbolic conservation laws. In this case we consider both Rusanov and Roe artificial diffusion operators. In the Rusanov case, two designs are considered, a nodal based diffusion operator and a local projection stabilization operator. The result is a discretization that is LED and has first order convergence behavior. To achieve high resolution, limited antidiffusion is added back to the semi-discrete form where the limiter is constructed from a linearity preserving local projection stabilization operator. The procedure follows the algebraic flux correction procedure usually used in flux corrected transport algorithms. To further deal with phase errors (or terracing) common in FCT type methods, high order background dissipation is added to the antidiffusive correction. The resulting stabilized semi-discrete scheme can be discretized in time using a wide variety of time integrators. Numerical examples involving nonlinear scalar Burgers equation, and several shock hydrodynamics simulations for the Euler system are considered to demonstrate the performance of the method. For time discretization, Crank-Nicolson scheme and backward Euler scheme are utilized. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper, we develop bound-preserving modified exponential Runge-Kutta (RK) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes to solve scalar hyperbolic equations with stiff source terms by extending the idea in Zhang and Shu [43]. Exponential strong stability preserving (SSP) high order time discretizations are constructed and then modified to overcome the stiffness and preserve the bound of the numerical solutions. It is also straightforward to extend the method to two dimensions on rectangular and triangular meshes. Even though we only discuss the bound-preserving limiter for DG schemes, it can also be applied to high order finite volume schemes, such as weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) finite volume schemes as well.

AB The numerical integration of stochastic trajectories to estimate the time to pass a threshold is an interesting physical quantity, for instance in Josephson junctions and atomic force microscopy, where the full trajectory is not accessible. We propose an algorithm suitable for efficient implementation on graphical processing unit in CUDA environment. The proposed approach for well balanced loads achieves almost perfect scaling with the number of available threads and processors, and allows an acceleration of about 400 x with a GPU GTX980 respect to standard multicore CPU. This method allows with off the shell GPU to challenge problems that are otherwise prohibitive, as thermal activation in slowly tilted potentials. In particular, we demonstrate that it is possible to simulate the switching currents distributions of Josephson junctions in the timescale of actual experiments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB We introduce an approach for simulating epitaxial growth by use of an island dynamics model on a forest of quadtree grids, and in a parallel environment. To this end, we use a parallel framework introduced in the context of the level-set method. This framework utilizes: discretizations that achieve a second-order accurate level-set method on non-graded adaptive Cartesian grids for solving the associated free boundary value problem for surface diffusion; and an established library for the partitioning of the grid. We consider the cases with: irreversible aggregation, which amounts to applying Dirichlet boundary conditions at the island boundary; and an asymmetric (Ehrlich-Schwoebel) energy barrier for attachment/detachment of atoms at the island boundary, which entails the use of a Robin boundary condition. We provide the scaling analyses performed on the Stampede supercomputer and numerical examples that illustrate the capability of our methodology to efficiently simulate different aspects of epitaxial growth. The combination of adaptivity and parallelism in our approach enables simulations that are several orders of magnitude faster than those reported in the recent literature and, thus, provides a viable framework for the systematic study of mound formation on crystal surfaces.

AB We introduce an efficient non-intrusive surrogate-based methodology for global sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification. Modified covariance-based sensitivity indices (mCov-SI) are defined for outputs that reflect correlated effects. The overall approach is applied to simulations of a complex plasma-coupled combustion system with disparate uncertain parameters in sub-models for chemical kinetics and a laser-induced breakdown ignition seed. The surrogate is based on an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) expansion, such as widely used in statistics, with orthogonal polynomials representing the ANOVA subspaces and a polynomial dimensional decomposition (PDD) representing its multi-dimensional components. The coefficients of the PDD expansion are obtained using a least-squares regression, which both avoids the direct computation of high-dimensional integrals and affords an attractive flexibility in choosing sampling points. This facilitates importance sampling using a Bayesian calibrated posterior distribution, which is fast and thus particularly advantageous in common practical cases, such as our large-scale demonstration, for which the asymptotic convergence properties of polynomial expansions cannot be realized due to computation expense. Effort, instead, is focused on efficient finite-resolution sampling. Standard covariance-based sensitivity indices (Cov-SI) are employed to account for correlation of the uncertain parameters. Magnitude of Cov-SI is unfortunately unbounded, which can produce extremely large indices that limit their utility. Alternatively, mCov-SI are then proposed in order to bound this magnitude is an element of[0, 1]. The polynomial expansion is coupled with an adaptive ANOVA strategy to provide an accurate surrogate as the union of several low-dimensional spaces, avoiding the typical computational cost of a high-dimensional expansion. It is also adaptively simplified according to the relative contribution of the different polynomials to the total variance. The approach is demonstrated for a laser-induced turbulent combustion simulation model, which includes parameters with correlated effects. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A provably time-stable method for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations arising in fluid dynamics on overset grids is presented in this paper. The method uses interface treatments based on the simultaneous approximation term (SAT) penalty method and derivative approximations that satisfy the summation-by-parts (SBP) property. Time-stability is proven using energy arguments in a norm that naturally relaxes to the standard diagonal norm when the overlap reduces to a traditional multiblock arrangement. The proposed overset interface closures are time-stable for arbitrary overlap arrangements. The information between grids is transferred using Lagrangian interpolation applied to the incoming characteristics, although other interpolation schemes could also be used. The conservation properties of the method are analyzed. Several one-, two-, and three-dimensional, linear and non-linear numerical examples are presented to confirm the stability and accuracy of the method. A performance comparison between the proposed SAT-based interface treatment and the commonly-used approach of injecting the interpolated data onto each grid is performed to highlight the efficacy of the SAT method.

AB The rapid change in scales over a shock has the potential to introduce unique difficulties in Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of compressible shock-turbulence flows if the governing model does not sufficiently capture the spectral distribution of energy in the upstream turbulence. A method for the regularization of LES of shock-turbulence interactions is presented which is constructed to enforce that the energy content in the highest resolved wavenumbers decays as k(-5/3), and is computed locally in physical-space at low computational cost. The application of the regularization to an existing subgrid scale model is shown to remove high wavenumber errors while maintaining agreement with Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of forced and decaying isotropic turbulence. Linear interaction analysis is implemented to model the interaction of a shock with isotropic turbulence from LES. Comparisons to analytical models suggest that the regularization significantly improves the ability of the LES to predict amplifications in subgrid terms over the modeled shockwave. LES and DNS of decaying, modeled post shock turbulence are also considered, and inclusion of the regularization in shock-turbulence LES is shown to improve agreement with lower Reynolds number DNS.

ID STOKES PROBLEM; EQUATIONS; COMPLEXES; SEQUENCE; FAMILY
AB We introduce a new family of mixed finite elements for incompressible nonlinear elasticity - compatible-strain mixed finite element methods(CSFEMs). Based on a Hu-Washizu-type functional, we write a four-field mixed formulation with the displacement, the displacement gradient, the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress, and a pressure-like field as the four independent unknowns. Using the Hilbert complexes of nonlinear elasticity, which describe the kinematics and the kinetics of motion, we identify the solution spaces of the independent unknown fields. In particular, we define the displacement in H-1, the displacement gradient in H(curl), the stress in H(div), and the pressure field in L-2. The test spaces of the mixed formulations are chosen to be the same as the corresponding solution spaces. Next, in a conforming setting, we approximate the solution and the test spaces with some piecewise polynomial subspaces of them. Among these approximation spaces are the tensorial analogues of the Nedelec and Raviart-Thomas finite element spaces of vector fields. This approach results in compatible-strainmixed finite element methods that satisfy both the Hadamard compatibility condition and the continuity of traction at the discrete level independently of the refinement level of the mesh. By considering several numerical examples, we demonstrate that CSFEMs have a good performance for bending problems and for bodies with complex geometries. CSFEMs are capable of capturing very large strains and accurately approximating stress and pressure fields. Using CSFEMs, we do not observe any numerical artifacts, e.g., checkerboarding of pressure, hourglass instability, or locking in our numerical examples. Moreover, CSFEMs provide an efficient framework for modeling heterogeneous solids. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The degenerate parabolic Generalized Porous Medium Equation (GPME) poses numerical challenges due to self-sharpening and its sharp corner solutions. For these problems, we show results for two subclasses of the GPME with differentiable k(p) with respect to p, namely the Porous Medium Equation (PME) and the superslow diffusion equation. Spurious temporal oscillations, and nonphysical locking and lagging have been reported in the literature. These issues have been attributed to harmonic averaging of the coefficient k(p) for small p, and arithmetic averaging has been suggested as an alternative. We show that harmonic averaging is not solely responsible and that an improved discretization can mitigate these issues. Here, we investigate the causes of these numerical artifacts using modified equation analysis. The modified equation framework can be used for any type of discretization. We show results for the second order finite volume method. The observed problems with harmonic averaging can be traced to two leading error terms in its modified equation. This is also illustrated numerically through a Modified Harmonic Method (MHM) that can locally modify the critical terms to remove the aforementioned numerical artifacts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper we propose a second-order accurate numerical method to solve elliptic problems with discontinuous coefficients (with general non-homogeneousjumps in the solution and its gradient) in 2D and 3D. The method consists of a finite-difference method on a Cartesian grid in which complex geometries (boundaries and interfaces) are embedded, and is second order accurate in the solution and the gradient itself. In order to avoid the drop in accuracy caused by the discontinuity of the coefficients across the interface, two numerical values are assigned on grid points that are close to the interface: a real value, that represents the numerical solution on that grid point, and a ghost value, that represents the numerical solution extrapolated from the other side of the interface, obtained by enforcing the assigned non-homogeneous jump conditions on the solution and its flux. The method is also extended to the case of matrix coefficient. The linear system arising from the discretization is solved by an efficient multigrid approach. Unlike the 1D case, grid points are not necessarily aligned with the normal derivative and therefore suitable stencils must be chosen to discretize interface conditions in order to achieve second order accuracy in the solution and its gradient. A proper treatment of the interface conditions will allow the multigrid to attain the optimal convergence factor, comparable with the one obtained by Local Fourier Analysis for rectangular domains. The method is robust enough to handle large jump in the coefficients: order of accuracy, monotonicity of the errors and good convergence factor are maintained by the scheme. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Coordinate singularities are sometimes encountered in computational problems. An important example involves global atmospheric models used for climate and weather prediction. Classical spherical coordinates can be used to parameterize the manifold - that is, generate a grid for the computational spherical shell domain. This particular parameterization offers significant benefits such as orthogonality and exact representation of curvature and connection (Christoffel) coefficients. But it also exhibits two polar singularities and at or near these points typical continuity/integral constraints on dependent fields and their derivatives are generally inadequate and lead to poor model performance and erroneous results. Other parameterizations have been developed that eliminate polar singularities, but problems of weaker singularities and enhanced grid noise compared to spherical coordinates (away from the poles) persist. In this study reparameterization invariance of geometric objects (scalars, vectors and the forms generated by their covariant derivatives) is utilized to generate asymptotic forms for dependent fields of interest valid in the neighborhood of a pole. The central concept is that such objects cannot be altered by the metric structure of a parameterization.
   The new boundary conditions enforce symmetries that are required for transformations of geometric objects. They are implemented in an implicit polar filter of a structured grid, nonhydrostatic global atmospheric model that is simulating idealized Held-Suarez flows. A series of test simulations using different configurations of the asymptotic boundary conditions are made, along with control simulations that use the default model numerics with no absorber, at three different grid sizes. Typically the test simulations are similar to 20% faster in wall clock time than the control-resulting from a decrease in noise at the poles in all cases. In the control simulations adverse numerical effects from the polar singularity are observed to increase with grid resolution. In contrast, test simulations demonstrate robust polar behavior independent of grid resolution. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Maximization of the smallest eigenfrequency of the linearized elasticity system with area constraint is investigated. The elasticity system is extended into a large background domain, but the void is vacuum and not filled with ersatz material. The piecewise constant level set (PCLS) method is applied to present two regions, the original material region and the void region. A quadratic PCLS function is proposed to represent the characteristic function. Consequently, the functional derivative of the smallest eigenfrequency with respect to PCLS function takes nonzero value in the original material region and zero in the void region. Apenalty gradient algorithm is proposed, which initializes the whole background domain with the original material and decreases the area of original material region till the area constraint is satisfied. 2D and 3D numerical examples are presented, illustrating the validity of the proposed algorithm.

AB A new approach at discretizing the temporal derivative of the Euler equations is here presented which can be used with dual time stepping. The temporal discretization stencil is derived along the lines of the Cauchy-Kowalevski procedure resulting in cross differences in spacetime but with some novel modifications which ensure the positivity of the discretization coefficients. It is then shown that the so-obtained spacetime cross differences result in changes to the wave speeds and can thus be incorporated within Roe or Steger-Warming schemes (with and without reconstruction-evolution) simply by altering the eigenvalues. The proposed approach is advantaged over alternatives in that it is positivity-preserving for the Euler equations. Further, it yields monotone solutions near discontinuities while exhibiting a truncation error in smooth regions less than the one of the second- or third-order accurate backward-difference-formula (BDF) for either small or large time steps. The high resolution and positivity preservation of the proposed discretization stencils are independent of the convergence acceleration technique which can be set to multigrid, preconditioning, Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov, block-implicit, etc. Thus, the current paper also offers the first implicit integration of the time-accurate Euler equations that is positivity-preserving in the strict sense (that is, the density and temperature are guaranteed to remain positive). This is in contrast to all previous positivity-preserving implicit methods which only guaranteed the positivity of the density, not of the temperature or pressure. Several stringent reacting and inert test cases confirm the positivity-preserving property of the proposed method as well as its higher resolution and higher computational efficiency over other second-order and third-order implicit temporal discretization strategies.

A ray-tracing analysis of the geometry is performed in order to extract the critical points with significant contributions. These points are then used to generate a reduced mesh, considering the regions of the geometry that surround each critical point and taking into account the electrical path followed from the source. The electromagnetic analysis of the reduced mesh produces very accurate results, requiring a fraction of the resources that the conventional analysis would utilize. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper presents a finite difference method for solving Poisson problems on a two-dimensional irregular domain. An implicit, level set representation of the domain boundary is assumed, as well as a Cartesian grid that is not fitted to the domain. The algorithm is based on a scheme for interface problems which captures the jump conditions via singular source terms. This paper adapts that method to deal with boundary value problems by employing a simple iterative process that simultaneously enforces the boundary condition and solves for an unknown jump condition. The benefit and novelty of this method is that the boundary condition is captured via easily implemented source terms. The system of equations that results at each iteration can be solved using a FFT-based fast Poisson solver. The scheme can accommodate Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions. We first address the constant coefficient Poisson equation, and then extend the scheme to accommodate the variable coefficient equation. Numerical examples indicate second order accuracy (or close to it) for the solution. The method also produces useful gradient approximations, but with generally lower convergence rates.

AB We present the mixed Galerkin discretization of distributed parameter port-Hamiltonian systems. On the prototypical example of hyperbolic systems of two conservation laws in arbitrary spatial dimension, we derive the main contributions: (i) A weak formulation of the underlying geometric (Stokes-Dirac) structure with a segmented boundary according to the causality of the boundary ports. (ii) The geometric approximation of the Stokes-Dirac structure by a finite-dimensional Dirac structure is realized using a mixed Galerkin approach and power-preserving linear maps, which define minimal discrete power variables. (iii) With a consistent approximation of the Hamiltonian, we obtain finite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian state space models. By the degrees of freedom in the power-preserving maps, the resulting family of structure-preserving schemes allows for trade-offs between centered approximations and upwinding. We illustrate the method on the example of Whitney finite elements on a 2D simplicial triangulation and compare the eigenvalue approximation in 1D with a related approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Transparent magnesium aluminate spinel (MgAl2O4) ceramics were successfully fabricated for the first time using commercially available nanopowders without sintering additive by a single hot-press step process. This method does not involve all the complexity of powder, green body pre-treatment and post-treatment, which are commonly used in the fabricating process. Effects of holding time (3-12 h) at the sintering temperature 1500 degrees C on the transmittance, microstructure and Vickers microhardness are investigated. The highest transmittance is achieved for the sample hot pressed at 1500 degrees C for 12 h, which exhibits 80.2% at the wavelength of 1100 nm. These results may provide a guide for understanding the microstructural development of transparent spinel without sintering additive. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Thin films of indium nitride were deposited on glass substrates using pulsed direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering with various power ranging from 100W to 150 W. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the deposited films revealed polycrystalline peaks of InN having preferred orientation towards the c-plane. The crystal quality of InN was significantly improved with increased sputtering power from 100W to 130 W. However, with further increase in the power to 150 W, the crystallinity of the film decreased. The morphological results indicated agglomeration of smaller grains into larger ones with increasing power. The band gap and electrical resistivity of InN films decreased with increase of power to 130W and then started to increase with further increase in the sputtering power. These results were associated with changes in the crystalline quality of InN at different sputtering powers. The optical properties of InN films have also been studied by the first principle approach to support our results about variation in band gap. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports a facile two-step hydrothermal method for the fabrication of f-ZnO@Fe2O3 nanostructures. Various characterization results show that the hierarchical nanocomposites are formed by the loading of well-crystallized alpha-Fe2O3 nanoparticles onto the flower-like ZnO. The nanostructures exhibit large specific surface area and narrow mesoporous size distribution. Morphological measurements indicate that Fe2O3 nanoparticles are densely and uniformly attached onto the entire surface of the f-ZnO. The catalytic performance of the f-ZnO@Fe2O3 on the thermal decomposition of AP is measured by TG and DTA methods. The results demonstrate that the f-ZnO@Fe2O3 nanostructures can lower the decomposition temperature and accelerate the decomposition process of ammonium perchlorate, which may be presumably ascribed to the synergistic effect between f-ZnO and alpha-Fe2O3 nanoparticles.

AB Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are promising nanomaterials with various industrial applications, including metal ion detection. Herein, a simple, green, and low-cost strategy was developed for the synthesis of fluorescent water-soluble CQDs for selective detection of Ag+ via one-step hydrothermal treatment of edible green plant, Broccoli. The functional group composition, morphology, and pH stability of the synthesized CQDs were investigated. In this study, the silver ions quenched the PL of the CQDs more strongly than other heavy metals, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.5 mu M, which indicates that the synthesized CQDs can be effectively used as an Ag+ sensing tool.

AB Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries represent one of the next-generation Li-ion batteries. However, the poor conductivity and large volumetric expansion of sulfur result in low rate performance and unfavorable cycle stability. Herein, a laminated structure of sulfur/reduced graphene oxide intercalated by carbon nanotube (CNT-rGO/S) composites was designed and fabricated for the first time to address the issue. The composites prepared via hydrothermal coprecipitation was endowed a perfect crystal and highly integrated structure, which retained a good electrical conductivity and accommodated the sulfur volume expansion due to the sufficient free space between the CNT-intercalated graphene layers. The CNT-rGO/S cathode exhibits a good capacity of 783.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C and a desirable cycling stability with 77.2% of the capacity remaining after 1000 cycles even at a rate as high as 5 C, which offers great potential for practical applications in Li-S batteries.

The crystal structure and surface morphology of the anatase-rutile phase transformation are investigated for pre and post loaded shock using X-ray diffraction, FT-Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy respectively.

AB Highly photoactive metal oxide catalyst can be developed by engineering the nanostructure of the material. The present study reports the engineering of ZnO nanostructures using the microwave technique. The physicochemical characterization reveals the role of microwave irradiation power and reaction temperature on ZnO nanostructure engineering. The structural and surface analyses of the samples prepared at room temperature and 180 degrees C, in various microwave power, confirms the formation of nanorods. The higher reaction temperature has favored the nanorods to a flower like structures and increase in microwave power leads to the formation of denser, uniform nanoflowers, with enlarged petal diameter. The photocatalytic performance of the samples was evaluated using Methylene Blue (MB) as probe pollutant under solar irradiation. All the samples showed relatively high photocatalytic performance in terms of rate constant and photonic efficiency. However, the sample prepared at 180 degrees C and 360W showed superior photocatalytic performance than the rest, which can be attributed to the effective photon absorption along with reduced charge carrier recombination. This study opens a new low-cost method for engineering the nanostructure for improving the photocatalytic performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a biomimetic rose petal whose contact angle hysteresis can be reversibly tuned by photo-illumination. With azobenzene interpenetrating polymer network, the micron-and nano-scale surface structure of a rose petal was duplicated. By changing the exposure light wavelength, the surface free energy of the artificial petal was modulated between trans-to-cis azobenzene photo-isomerations. The static contact angle of the artificial petal can be tuned to range from 99.2 +/- 0.9 degrees to 140.9 +/- 1.8 degrees. The contact angle hysteresis between 50.3 +/- 0.6 degrees and > 84 degrees can be achieved. Comparing to the value measured on a real rose petal, the fabricated counterpart presents more prominent petal effect in terms of larger static contact angle and greater contact angle hysteresis.

AB Friction stir welded (FSW) Mg alloys usually exhibit an undesirable combination of strength and elongation due to its strong texture develops in the weld. Thus, large load FSW associated with an extremely low welding speed and rotation rate were applied to an AZ31B Mg alloy to modify the microstructure, the texture and the mechanical properties of the joint. The twin structure in the weld provided adequate barriers for dislocation motion for strengthening and created more local sites for nucleating and accommodating dislocations, thereby elevating ductility and strain hardening of the weld. This work also provided a simple and effective method to enhance the strength of an FSW Mg joint without ductility loss. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Crystallization of the amorphous alloys of Co-Si-B-Fe-Nb system has been investigated by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. It has been shown that the structure formed upon crystallization significantly depends on niobium concentration. The formation of nanocrystals with a bcc lattice was discovered at considerably lower iron content than it has been observed earlier. When niobium concentration is decreasing, the fraction of the nanocrystalline bcc phase decreases, niobium-free samples are multiphase and do not contain bcc nanocrystals. The average nanocrystal size also depends on niobium content and considerably decreases when niobium concentration is increasing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This contribution analyzes the structure of sodium-lime-silica (SLS) glass alkali-activated with NaOH. The mix forms an alkali-activated cement (AAC), which has proven to be mechanically resistant when immerged under water. The aim is to determine whether the presence of calcium in the glass powder may have contributed, together with alkali-activation, to forming calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H), which are responsible for water resistance in hydrated Portland cement pastes. This is investigated by SEM, where needles similar to C-S-H in Portland paste are observed, then by X Ray Diffraction (XRD), but the pastes are too amorphous to allow any phase identification. Finally, Si-29 magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) shows that C-S-H are at most 2-3% in the 4 M and 8 M NaOH AAC pastes, so that they cannot be considered responsible for the water resistance of SLS glass AAC pastes and mortars. The latter are rather formed of sodium silicate hydrates and/or silica gel. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, we present a novel strategy to fabricate high porous fluffy type Poly (L-lactide) (PLA) nanofibrous scaffold for tissue regeneration. Low-density nanofibrous scaffold was fabricated by electrospinning the blend of PLA and lactic acid (LA), followed by selective leaching of LA. Digital images, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) images, Infra-red (IR) spectra, Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves revealed the formation of the low density biomimetic nanofibrous mesh. In vitro cell compatibility results indicated that as-fabricated PLA nanofibrous scaffold enhanced the cell proliferation and growth compared to the corresponding two-dimensional nanofibrous scaffold. Furthermore, confocal microscopy images showed that cells seeded on the fluffy type nanofibrous mesh infiltrated throughout the depth of the scaffold, compared to no penetrating growth for the two-dimensional scaffold. The fabrication of such fascinating materials may provide new insights into the design and development of the low density nanofibrous scaffolds for various tissue engineering applications.

The film was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, cross-section Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) all confirming a thin continuous film of highly crystalline silicon grown on buffered soda-lime glass. This is a breakthrough process that can replace low temperature polysilicon (LTPS) in thin-film transistor (TFT) fabrication for driving pixels in large displays. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V.

AB Red mud presents significant environmental problems, so that its incorporation in geopolymers could represent an alternative solution to produce valuable products from this residue. Novel geopolymers using red mud as source of alumina and waste glass as silica supplier were developed, using sodium hydroxide as the only ` non- waste' material. The formation of a homogeneous polymeric gel, confirmed by solid- state NMR and EDX analysis, promoted the stabilization of possible pollutants. Moreover, the materials exhibit a remarkable compressive strength (up to 45 MPa, for 60 wt% red mud). (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB The natural dyes were extracted from Peltophorum pterocarpum and Acalypha amentacea using water and ethanol by cold maceration technique. They were then used as sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), and their characteristics were studied. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles were synthesized by sol-gel technique and were subjected to structural and morphological studies "such as X -ray diffraction analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)". The optical absorption spectrum of dye extracts were studied by UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy. A thin layer of TiO2 was coated by Doctor Blade method on FTO glass plate. The coated TiO2 films were immersed in dye extracts. The transparent conductive glass (FTO) was used as photoanode. The influence of the different parameters such as "open circuit voltage" (VOC), "short circuit current" (JSC), "fill factor" (FF), and efficiency (g) of the photovoltaic characteristics of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were analyzed. The maximum efficiency was found in mixed dye extracted using ethanol. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The effects of this BSO morphology is considered to play an essential role in a better performing PSC device. Enhanced efficiency of 2.91% is recorded for rod based active layer compared to particle (1.93%) in ambient condition. However, humidity plays a crucial role which affects the performance of a PSC device in ambient condition and this is further monitored through contact angle measurement which can be identified as an indirect tool to understand the stability of the perovskite device.

AB The formation of printed circuit patterns on non-conductive substrates has many applications in high value sectors such as electronics manufacturing. Current semi-additive and subtractive circuit manufacturing processes use photolithography to pattern substrates coated with a thin or relatively thick metal film. This process is often wasteful and expensive. Using an innovative approach; composite Fe3O4-Ag nanoparticles were synthesized and attracted to a magnetic field. The nanoparticles catalysed electroless copper deposition. Such a catalyst is new to electroless plating and was deposited selectively on a dielectric substrate using a gradient magnetic field. In this way, subsequent electroless copper plating occurred exclusively where the magnetic field was applied, whilst the remaining surface was free of deposited metal. The advantage of this additive method of manufacture is that less material is needed and less waste is produced. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this letter, we report the effects of preferred crystallographic orientation of Mo films on the formation of MoS2 layer through elemental sulphurization process. Vacuum thermal annealing of as-sputtered Mo films results in noticeable change in preferred crystallographic orientation from (1 1 0) to (2 1 1) plane. Correlation between structural and Raman spectroscopy study indicates that Mo film with predominantly (2 1 1) orientation results in pronounced formation of MoS2 compared to the film with the higher degree of (1 1 0) orientation. Planar packing factor, which depends on crystallographic orientation is proposed to play a crucial role in determining the degree of MoS2 formation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The research of superior ionic conductors is a very active field. Identifying such materials would allow for the design of improved solid-state Li-ion batteries, solving the safety hazard posed by the liquid electrolytes and improving the electrochemical stability and thus the energy efficiency. In this work, we study lithium orthothioborate Li3BS3 by means of first-principle atomistic calculations based on density functional theory. This material is a very promising super ion conductor candidate, as it is a layered compound based on a deformed body-centred structure of the anion sublattice. The minimum energy paths for the diffusion of the lithium ions are identified, and the activation energy are evaluated using the nudged elastic band method. A very fast 1D diffusive channel is found, contained in a Li-rich layer, with an activation energy below 0.1 eV. The other paths connecting these layers and extending the mobility of lithium to the whole structure are found to have activation barriers of 0.25 eV or lower. This bottleneck corresponds to a diffusion coefficient of the order of 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1), thus characterising lithium orthothioborate as an excellent ionic conductor. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

DE Thin films; Spray; Cu2ZnSnS4; Structural and electrical properties
AB Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films were prepared by "Spray Sandwich" technique. The structural, surface morphological and electrical properties of the films were carried out by means of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and impedance spectroscopy measurement techniques. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern showed the characteristic peaks at (1 1 2), (2 2 0) and (3 1 2) planes, which correspond to Cu2ZnSnS4, thin films. The Nyquist impedance spectra exhibited depressed semicircles with equivalent circuit function as typical parallel RC. The activation energy value calculated from angular frequency relaxation and DC conductivity proved that the conduction mechanism was thermally activated by hopping between localized states. Moreover, the analysis of frequency and temperature dependence of conductivity support the correlated barrier hopping (CBH) model. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Lithium carbonate nanoparticles were synthesized by facile chemical route in the presence of organic capping agents. Nanosized Li2CO3 particles of similar to 86 nm in size were produced from LiOH solution and preferably using PVA as a capping agent. FTIR-ATR analysis revealed that Li2CO3 phase is formed during calcination of the freeze-dried synthesis product. In vitro tests shown that nanoparticle concentrations up to 600 mg/mL do not disturb cell viability and promote the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells by Li+ ions (9.7 mM) leached from the nanoparticle. The biological properties exhibited by the Li2CO3 nanoparticles make of them attractive for bone repair applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, the oriented alpha- and beta-crystals were simultaneously fabricated in the iPP parts with a beta-nucleating agent by means of the oscillation shear injection molding (OSIM) technique. The beta-nucleated iPP parts demonstrated an interesting deformation behavior, traced by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction equipped with a uniaxial tensile apparatus. In the small strain region (6.7%) from the yield point to the strain hardening point, dramatic changes in terms of the crystal orientation and phase transition took place. In this region, the content and orientation degree of oriented alpha-crystals kept continuously increasing. On the contrary, the content of oriented beta-crystals was successively decreasing until they almost disappeared, along with their fluctuant orientation. The formation of oriented alpha-crystals was initially at the sacrifice of oriented beta-crystals, and subsequently the unoriented crystal and amorphous phase. Our work provides a theoretic foundation for the application of iPP parts with oriented alpha-and beta-crystals under loading. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The microstructure and wear resistance of sputtered MoS2 films can be improved by adding some amount of metals. However, the oxidation-resistance of MoS2-metals films would be worried because some metals are sensitive to atomic oxygen (AO). In this paper, the inert Sb2O3 was introduced into the MoS2 film, and its effect on the structure and anti-oxidation ability of the MoS2 film was clarified. XRD and SEM results revealed that due to the addition of Sb2O3, the growth of MoS2 micro-platelets was almost suppressed, and so the composite film was amorphous and very compact. XPS analysis indicated that for the composite film, the influence by the AO irradiation was restricted into the film surface layer. Namely, the composite film exhibited a better anti-oxidation ability in the AO environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the current work, pure zinc oxide (ZnO), cerium (Ce) doped ZnO, lanthanum (La) doped ZnO and cerium-lanthanum (Ce-La) doped ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) have been synthesized by the wet chemical method. The prepared samples have been dispersed into water and mixed thoroughly by the way of ultrasonication process to acquire nanofluid samples. The change of ultrasound velocity in aqueous solution was investigated as a function of particle size and suspension density. The thermal conductivity and acoustical parameters such as adiabatic compressibility, intermolecular free length and acoustic impedance have been evaluated from the experimental data. Also, the thermal conductivities of nanofluids have been calculated through ultrasonic method and the results were compared experimentally with the flash laser technique method. The thermal conductivities decrease with doping according to the rare earth atomic mass and ionic radius. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of asymmetric cold rolling on the crystallographic texture of the AA2024 aluminum alloy was investigated. The texture after asymmetric cold rolling consisted of the strong Goss {011} < 100 >, Goss-Brass {011} < 115 >, Brass {011} < 211 >, and Rotated Goss {011} < 011 > components (i.e. a strong alpha-fiber < 011 >parallel to ND). It was found that asymmetric cold rolling present great differences in texture evolution relative to conventional cold rolling. The results showed that the asymmetric cold rolling of AA2024 at 20% and 40% thickness reductions led to increasing the Goss/Brass texture ratio to 1.44 and 1.32, respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB MgZrTa2O8 ceramics with CaF2 addition were synthesized by solid-state reaction, and the effects of CaF2 addition on sintering behavior and microwave dielectric properties were investigated. The densification of MgZrTa2O8 ceramics could be effectively accelerated with CaF2 addition and the sintering temperature of CaF2-doped MgZrTa2O8 ceramics was lowered from 1475 degrees C to 1375 degrees C due to liquid phase effect. The phase composition of MgZrTa2O8 ceramics with CaF2 addition varied from single phase to three phases because of the reaction between MgZrTa2O8 and CaF2. Well-developed microstructure was observed with 0.5 wt% CaF2 addition owing to the single phase. The microwave dielectric properties presented a significant dependence on extrinsic effects. The dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) of CaF2-doped MgZrTa2O8 ceramics had no significant difference for all levels of CaF2 addition. The quality factors Q x f were strongly affected by the content of CaF2 owing to the density, grain size and phase composition. The temperature coefficients of resonant frequency (tau(f)) were correlated with the dielectric constant, which could be optimized to -2.86 ppm/degrees C with CaF2 addition. In this work, the MgZrTa2O8 ceramics could be optimized to the temperature-stable dielectric material for microwave application. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Plasma electrolytic oxidation of zirconium in alkaline solution containing Er2O3 powder was used for preparation of ZrO2:Er3+ coatings. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of ZrO2:Er3+ excited by ultraviolet irradiation are composed of broad PL band associated with ZrO2 host and sharp bands corresponding to f-f transitions of Er3+. The strongest green PL emission band of Er3+ in the range from 540 nm to 580 nm is assigned to S-4(3/2) -> I-4(15/2) transition. The PL excitation spectra of ZrO2:Er3+ characterize broad band from 250 nm to 350 nm associated with charge transfer state of Er-3+ and the series of peaks in the range from 350 nm to 530 nm which are associated with 4f transitions of the Er3+ from ground state I-4(15/2) to higher levels. Obtained results allowed the identification of down-conversion PL mechanism. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel method for preparing nano/submicron porous surfaces in biomedical Co-Cr-Mo alloy is presented, which involves local dealloying in a pure Zn melt at 500-800 degrees C and selective removal of Zn-rich phase formed in the dealloying products. First, reaction layers composed of Zn-rich and Zn-lean phases were formed by partially dealloying of Co from the alloy, which thickness ranges from 6 mu m to 90 mu m. Then, various nano/submicron porous surface layers containing a small amount of Zn were introduced by selective removing the Zn-rich phase in 1 M HCl aqueous solution. The morphologies of either reaction layers or porous structures were significantly affected by dealloying temperature. The elements of Co, Cr, Mo and Zn in porous surface layers exist predominantly in their metallic states. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A measurement approach of localized micro-area electrical impedances based on micro-nano manipulator was developed for polycrystalline ZnO in scanning electron microscope. Two probes as microelectrodes clamped onto the manipulator were applied to probe the electrical impedances by positioning operations in demand across a single grain boundary and within adjacent grains. Equivalent circuits were performed to fit experimental data, represented by impedance complex planes, in the frequency range 20 Hz to 1 MHz. The minor fitting errors indicated the validity of equivalent circuit parameters, which demonstrated the fact that grain boundaries were the intrinsic nature of high-resistive impedance at low-frequency DC. A quantitative method of contact resistance was proposed by equivalent circuit fitting. High linear fitting degree of impedances at 20 Hz versus probing distances can be inferred that relatively uniform impurity doping exists in a single grain. The quantitative studies of electrical impedances, vertical and parallel to a single grain boundary, can account for the uneven degree of resistive capacity existing in different locations. Electrical resistances of multi-single grain boundaries can also be statistically utilized to predict the impedance properties of bulk ZnO at the certain lower frequency. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ID THERMOKINETIC DESCRIPTION; BOUNDARIES; STABILITY
AB The thermo-kinetic stabilization that incorporates mixed effects of grain boundary (GB) energy and activation energy for GB migration has shown enormous advantages in describing thermal stability of nanocrystalline materials. However, its underlying physics is still unclear due to the lack of proofs that the two effects coexist and act together to impact on grain growth. In this work, a thermo-kinetic correlation is derived to bridge GB energy and activation energy in nanocrystalline alloys. Meanwhile, molecular dynamic simulations are performed to determine the two parameters in Al-based systems. The results shows that upon GB segregation, the GB energy is reduced in contrast with the increased activation energy. This analytically suggests a thermo-kinetic origin for stabilization due to GB segregation, other than pure thermodynamic or kinetic sources. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A unified solution in fuzzy capital budgeting

AB Since the mid-1980s, both academics and practitioners have proposed and discussed various solutions in fuzzy capital budgeting. Based primarily on traditional capital budgeting methods, these solutions present the same problems as their respective deterministic methods: the implicit assumptions of the reinvestment rates; the possibility of multiple rates of return; and the possibility of anomalous behavior of the net present value method. This paper presents a unified solution in fuzzy capital budgeting based on modified deterministic methods proposed in the financial literature. This unified approach eliminates those problems and has the property of matching decisions on acceptance or rejection of investment projects with same life horizons and same scales and therefore maximize shareholder wealth. An insight is provided into the advantages of these investment project appraisal methods by comparing and contrasting them with traditional fuzzy methods. A comprehensive case study, based on an investment project on exploration of an oil field under both deterministic and fuzzy conditions, is included to illustrate the use of these methods. Due to the complexity of the calculations involved, new MS-Excel financial functions are developed, by using Visual Basic for Applications. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a unifying approach to capital budgeting under uncertainty that emphasizes the strengths of the modified methods, while bypassing the individual conflicts and drawbacks of the conventional capital budgeting methods. Results confirm that the proposed solution has many advantages over other capital budgeting methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) concerns selecting, ranking or sorting a set of alternatives which are evaluated with respect to a number of criteria. There are several MCDM methods, the two core elements of which are (i) evaluating the performance of the alternatives with respect to the criteria, (ii) finding the importance (weight) of the criteria. There are several methods to find the weights of the criteria, however, when it comes to the alternative measures with respect to the criteria, usually the existing MCDM methods use simple monotonic linear value functions. Usually an increasing or decreasing linear function is assumed between a criterion level (over its entire range) and its value. This assumption, however, might lead to improper results. This study proposes a family of piecewise value functions which can be used for different decision criteria for different decision problems. Several real-world examples from existing literature are provided to illustrate the applicability of the proposed value functions. A numerical example of supplier selection (including a comparison between simple monotonic linear value functions, piecewise linear value functions, and exponential value functions) shows how considering proper value functions could affect the final results of an MCDM problem.

AB This paper presents a novel non-supervised clustering method based on adaptive Bayesian trees (ABT). A Bayesian framework is proposed for seeking modes of the underlying discrete distribution of the input data, and the data is represented by hierarchical clusters found using the adaptive Bayesian trees approach. The application of the proposed clustering technique to color image segmentation is investigated, exploring the inherent hierarchical tree structure of the proposed approach to represent color images hierarchically. The experimental results with the BSD300 dataset and 21 comparative methods that are representative of the art suggest that the proposed ABT clustering scheme potentially can be more reliable for segmenting color images than the comparative approaches. The proposed ABT approach achieved an average PRI value of 0.8148 and an average GCE value of 0.1701, suggesting that potentially the proposed scheme can improve over the comparative methods results. Also, the visual evaluation of the results confirm the competitiveness of the proposed approach. Other applications of the ABT clustering scheme in computer vision and pattern recognition currently are under investigation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bayesian learning has been recently considered as an effective means of accounting for uncertainty in trained deep network parameters. This is of crucial importance when dealing with small or sparse training datasets. On the other hand, shallow models that compute weighted sums of their inputs, after passing them through a bank of arbitrary randomized nonlinearities, have been recently shown to enjoy good test error bounds that depend on the number of nonlinearities. Inspired from these advances, in this paper we examine novel deep network architectures, where each layer comprises a bank of arbitrary nonlinearities, linearly combined using multiple alternative sets of weights. We effect model training by means of approximate inference based on a t-divergence measure; this generalizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence in the context of the t-exponential family of distributions. We adopt the t-exponential family since it can more flexibly accommodate real-world data, that entail outliers and distributions with fat tails, compared to conventional Gaussian model assumptions. We extensively evaluate our approach using several challenging benchmarks, and provide comparative results to related state-of-the-art techniques. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB One of the most important features of modern production is that the demand for the product is constantly changing. The problems showing demand variability in certain time periods are called dynamic facility layout problems (DFLP). The establishment of a balance between handling and moving costs is attempted with such problems. Because the DFLP are complex combinatorial optimization problems, classical optimization techniques may not always be sufficient to solve them. Furthermore, it is necessary to find a solution within a reasonable computation time. Therefore, researchers tend to use heuristic methods. In the literature, various heuristic methods, such as the genetic algorithm, tabu search and ant-colony algorithm, were used to solve the DFLP. The paper introduces the use of bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) to solve the DFLP. In this study, a new hybrid heuristic algorithm, called simulated annealing which is based on bacterial foraging optimization (SABFO), is proposed for the DFLP. Also, the parameter tuning of the SABFO is made by Taguchi method. The proposed algorithm is tested on the most-used test problems in the literature, and satisfactory results are obtained at reasonable computation times. The study is important to show how BFO that is a new heuristic approach is applied to the DFLP. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Teaching-Learning-Based Optimisation (TLBO) is one of the more recently developed metaheuristics and has been successfully applied to solve various optimisation problems. However, TLBO has not been academically reported for solving the robust machine layout design (MLD) problems with dynamic demand. Considering internal logistics activities, shortening material flow distance within a manufacturing area can lead to efficient productivity and a decrease in related costs. The robust machine layout is concerned with determining the efficient arrangement of machines/facilities located on a manufacturing shop floor under future demand fluctuation. A robust designed layout is essential for a company to maintain a high productivity rate through multiple time-periods of demand uncertainty with minimum effects related to the re-layout time and cost, manufacturing disruption, and the movement of monument machines. The objectives of this paper were to: i) describe the development of a computer aided layout designing tool for minimising the total material flow distance under dynamic demand scenario, ii) investigate the appropriate setting of TLBO parameters, and iii) propose four TLBO modifications for improving its performance. The modified TLBOs were inspired by multiple teachers with two types of classes and two approaches to teacher selection. The numerical experiments were designed and conducted using eleven MLD bench marking datasets. Statistical analyses on the experimental results showed a superior performance for the proposed modifications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper extends the concept of biological co-evolution to explain the performance and survival of one type of service organizations. It proposes that service delivery network design would benefit from complex adaptive systems (CAS) modeling approaches to recreate organizational phenomena driven by the interaction of the organization with its operating environment. This approach, paired with experimental design methods can serve as a virtual laboratory.
   We take the case of social service delivery (SSD) organizations that are structured as nonprofit organizations providing humanitarian assistance and relief services. These organizations often serve different geographical regions, thus, racial composition, migration patterns, and wealth of the populations served are factors that vary between locations. SSDs operate through service nodes (i.e., field offices, chapters, branches) in a network configuration. Therefore, the managerial decision of where to locate the field offices is an important one. An agent-based model to recreate agents' interactions as proxies of those exchanges occurring in real SSD settings is used. A series of validation experiments instill confidence that our model can be used as a virtual research laboratory. This paper contributes to the field of organizational design by testing a model able to recreate different policies that combined with different operating conditions impact the network over time and space. In addition, it provides experimental insights on what type of network configuration might provide a higher number of services delivered over time across the service network. The results can inform those defining the service system architecture looking to achieve SSD's goals considering the demographics of the markets served. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID PLACEMENT PROBLEM; POINT
AB The development of computer systems that emulate human expertise in decision making is a common task in the automation of processes like planning, design, prediction or control. When it comes to map design, one of the problems of the cartographer is to orchestrate the elements of the map so that it clearly conveys its information to the readers. Several disciplines, such as Computational Geometry, Cartography and Operations Research have devoted diverse efforts to automate this task, commonly identified in the research domain as the Point-Feature Label Placement (PFLP). These approaches aim to avoid or minimize overlapping elements on the map, but almost no attempt to model possible ambiguities of feature and label pairs has been conducted so far. This article presents four Integer Programming formulations for the PFLP problem that incorporate ambiguity as an indicator of the solution quality. A very basic heuristic procedure is also introduced as an alternative to the exact formulations for large instances. All the proposed methods are tested on several maps of Spanish municipalities. Finally, some conclusions and recommendations are given. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An effective and simultaneous liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was used with the aim of quantifying monosodium glutamate (MSG) in foodstuffs, such as chips, taste cubes, sauces and soups. The results were linear (R-2 = 1), with very low LOD and LOQ values, 1.0 mu g/kg, 5.0 mu g/kg, respectively. Excellent repeatability and reproducibility were also achieved. This highly sensitive and robust LC-MS/MS technique was applied successfully for the detection and quantification of MSG in a wide variety of foodstuffs. MSG contents ranged from 0.01 g/100 g to 15.39 g/100 g in food samples. Importantly, determination of free glutamic acid in the daily diet could also prevent various side effects associated with consumption of excess free glutamic acid.

AB The fate of zoxamide and its enantiomers were evaluated in detail during wine-making process. The enantiomers of zoxamide were separated and determined by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) after each processing procedure including washing, peeling, fermentation and clarification. Significant enantioselectivity was observed in all three treatments with the half-lives of R-zoxamide and S-zoxamide estimated to be 45.6 and 52.9 h in Group A, 45.0 and 52.1 h in Group B, 56.8 and 70.7 h in Group C, respectively. The results indicated that R-zoxamide degraded faster than S-zoxamide during the fermentation process. The processing factors (PFs) of each procedure were generally less than 1, and the PF of the overall process ranged from 0.019 to 0.051, which indicated that the whole process can reduce the zoxamide residue in red and white wine obviously. The results could help facilitate more accurate risk assessments of zoxamide during wine-making process.

AB The viscoelastic characteristics of nixtamalized corn masa were assessed by the dynamic oscillatory test. Masa samples were prepared with flours obtained by nixtamalization with different calcium sources: Ca(OH)(2) (traditional), wood ashes (classic), CaCO3 (ecological), CaSO4 (ecological), CaCl2 (ecological), and Ca(C2H5COO)(2) (ecological). A sample cooking without calcium source was used as control. Storage (G') and loss (G '') moduli were higher in masa from traditional and classic processes indicating a more elastic and viscous masa. Masa of flours from CaCl2 and Ca(C2H5COO)(2) had the lowest values of G' and G ''. Viscoelastic properties were explained in terms of the degree of starch gelatinization, the hydrolysis of pericarp and fibre content, the calcium-starch and calcium-zein interactions, as well as the presence of amylose-lipid complexes. Nixtamalization with Ca(OH)(2) and wood ashes gave the best viscoelastic characteristics of masa.

AB Recently, there has been a growing concern of consumers on the authenticity of food ingredients including adulteration with porcine and/or its derivatives. Therefore, this work reports on the development of a novel, simple, sensitive and rapid luminol-based electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technique for Sus scrofa (Porcine) DNA detection. Porcine DNA was firstly amplified using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method and subsequently added to luminol solution for further ECL analysis for quantification. The DNA-luminol complexes were formed causing the diffusion of luminol towards the electrode surface to be slowed down and hindered that resulted in low luminol intensity. The LAMP-ECL sensor is shown to be highly specific, sensitive (>= 0.1 pg/mu L) and rapid (similar to 5 min for detection). Hence, by employing this principle with carbon screen-printed electrode (SPE), this technique has a potential to be developed further into a compact biosensor for the verifying food authenticity.

AB The rates at which wine consumes oxygen are important technological parameters for whose measurement there are not accepted procedures. In this work, volumes of 8 wines are contacted with controlled volumes of air in airtight tubes containing oxygen-sensors and are further agitated at 25 degrees C until O-2 consumption is complete. Three exposure levels of O-2 were used: low (10 mg/L) and medium or high (18 or 32 mg/L plus the required amount to oxidize all wine SO2). In each oxygen level, 2-4 independent segments following pseudo-first order kinetics were identified, plus an initial segment at which wine consumed O-2 very fast. Overall, multivariate data techniques identify six different Oxygen-Consumption-Rates (OCRs) as required to completely define wine O-2 consumption. Except the last one, all could be modeled from the wine initial chemical composition. Total acetaldehyde, Mn, Cu/Fe, blue and red pigments and gallic acid seem to be essential to determine these OCRs.

AB The red wines made from Vitis vinifera were identified as skin-whitening effectors by using in vitro assays. OPCs in the wine were evaluated for tyrosinase activity and melanogenesis. Strong tyrosinase inhibitory activity was observed in fractions with high oligomeric proanthocyanidin (OPC) content. Among OPC dimers, a strong inhibitory effect on tyrosinase was observed with OPCs which contain (+)-catechin as an upper unit. Melanogenesis inhibitory effect was observed with OPCs which have (-)-epicatechin as upper units. Also, OPC trimers, upper and middle units joined with 4 -> 8 bonds, showed stronger effects compared to trimers with 4 -> 6 linkages. Interestingly, (-)-epicatechin-(4 beta -> 8)-(-)-epicatechin 3-O-gallate, which is a unique component of grapes has potent inhibitory effects on both tyrosinase and melanogenesis. Our data provide structural information about such active compounds. These results suggest that red wines containing OPC, have high melanogenesis inhibitory effect and are supposed to have skin-whitening effect.

AB The aim of this work was the development of a simple, novel and accurate method for the determination of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and its first five catabolites: adenosine diphosphate (ADP), adenosine monophosphate (AMP), inosine monophosphate (IMP), inosine (Ino) and hypoxanthine (Hx), in fish tissue, based on hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). For this purpose, a stationary phase for polar and hydrophilic compounds (ZIC-pHILIC) was used. The effect of different chromatographic parameters and the molecular mechanism based on the van't Hoff plot were examined. The t-test and Dixon's Q-test were applied in order to examine statistical differences and outlier values. The recovery of the method ranged between 82.7% and 127% and the %RSD values were lower than 10% for all analytes determined. The method was applied in frozen sea bream samples stored at 0-4 degrees C. The Ki-, G-, H- and F values were calculated for the estimation of the level of fish freshness.

AB Cluster thinning is a common practice for regulating vine yield and grape quality. The effects of cluster thinning on vine photosynthesis, berry ripeness and flavonoid composition of V. vinifera L. Cabernet Sauvignon were evaluated during two seasons. Half of the clusters were removed at pea-size and veraison relative to two controls, respectively. Both cluster thinning treatments significantly increased pruning weight and decreased yield. No effects of cluster thinning on berry growth, ripeness and flavonol composition were observed. Early cluster thinning decreased the photosynthetic rate at pea-size, but the effect diminished at post-veraison. Early cluster thinning significantly promoted the biosynthesis of anthocyanins but decreased the proportion of 3'5'-hydroxylated and acylated anthocyanins at veraison. Late cluster thinning decreased the proportions of 3'5'-hydroxylated and acylated anthocyanins. Additionally, Cluster thinning showed inconsistent effects on flavan-3-ol composition over the two seasons.

AB Chemical investigations on Glycyrrhiza spp. have mostly been focused on G. glabra (typically cultivated in Europe, henceforth called European licorice), G. uralensis and G. inflata (known as Chinese licorice) with little information on the constituents of other Glycyrrhiza species. According to the growing interest in further Glycyrrhiza spp. to be used as sweeteners, the roots of G. triphylla have been investigated. The LC-ESI/LTQOrbitrap/MS profile of the methanolic extract of G. triphylla roots guided the isolation of 21 compounds, of which the structures were elucidated by 1D- and 2D-NMR experiments. Based on this approach, 6 previously unreported compounds including two isoflavones 7,5'-dihydroxy-6,3'-dimethoxy-isoflavone-7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4) and 7,5'-dihydroxy-6,3'-dimethoxy-isoflavone-7-O-(7,8-dihydro-p-hydroxycinnamoyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (7) and four saponins, named licoricesaponins M3 (13), N2 (14), O2 (16) and P2 (18), have been characterized.
   It is to be noted that the accurate masses of some compounds here reported for the first time corresponded to those of compounds previously described in Glycyrrhiza spp. Thus an approach based only on MS analysis could be misleading; only isolation followed by NMR analysis allowed us to unambiguously assign the structures of these previously unreported compounds.

AB The effects of fermentation by autochthonous microbial starters on phenolics composition of Apulian table olives, Bella di Cerignola (BDC), Termite di Bitetto (TDB) and Cellina di Nardo (CEL) were studied, highlighting also the cultivars influence. In BDC with starter, polyphenols amount doubled compared with commercial sample, while in TDB and CEL, phenolics remain almost unchanged. The main phenolics were hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, verbascoside and luteolin, followed by hydroxytyrosol-acetate detected in BDC and cyanidine-3-glucoside and quercetin in CEL. Scavenger capacity in both DPPH and CAA assays, assessed the highest antioxidant effect for CEL with starters (21.7 mg Trolox eq/g FW; 8.5 mu mol hydroxytyrosol eq/100 g FW). The polyphenols were highly in vitro bioaccessible (> 60%), although modifications in their profile, probably for combined effect of environment and microorganisms, were noted. Finally, fermented table olives are excellent source of health promoting compounds, since hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol are almost 8 times more than in olive oil.

AB The physicochemical properties of tea extracts are significantly affected by the extraction method. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of static and dynamic extractions on the concentrations of chemical components and taste quality of green tea extracts. Our results show that extraction of chemical components using static extraction follows a pseudo-second-order reaction, while that of dynamic extraction follows a first-order reaction. The concentrations of the solids, polyphenols, and free amino acids in green tea extract prepared by dynamic extraction were much higher, although the overall yields were not significantly different between the two extraction methods. Green tea extracts obtained via dynamic extraction were of lower bitterness and astringency, as well and higher intensities of umami and overall acceptability. These results suggest that dynamic extraction is more suitable for the processing of green tea concentrate because of the higher concentration of green tea extract.

AB Morus nigra L. is a beneficial food due to rich phenolic components. While aiming higher yields for bioactive constituents, reduction in terms of raw material, solvent, time and energy gained more importance to provide a sustainable life for human and nature. Microwave assisted extraction (MAE) of Morus nigra fruits was optimized in order to elicit process parameters maximizing bioactive metabolites and tyrosinase inhibitory activity. Spectrophotometry and UPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS systems were utilized for quantitative analysis of total phenol, flavonoid and anthocyanin contents. Optimum conditions for MAE were determined as 500 W, 35% ethanol, 10 min yielding 12.63 mg/g cya-3-glu equiv. anthocyanin and IC50 value of 1.60 mg/ml for tyrosinase inhibitory activity. Microwave extracts prevailed better outcomes compared to conventional extraction methods (10.93 mg/g content with IC50 of 2.81 mg/ml). MAE could be considered as an advanced technique to obtain extracts from Morus nigra fruits with higher bioactive content and activity.

AB An enzymatic process was developed for the preparation of a nutritionally enriched 1,3-diacylglycerol(DAG)-rich oil from a blend of refined sunflower and rice bran oils. The process involves hydrolysis of vegetable oil blend using Candida cylindracea followed by esterification with glycerol using Lipozyme RM1M. The resultant DAG-rich oil contains 84% of DAG (66% of 1,3-DAG, 18% of 1,2-DAG) and 16% of triacylglycerol (TAG) along with micro nutrients like gamma-oryzanol, tocotrienols, tocopherols and phytosterols. Nutritional studies of the DAG-rich oil were conducted in Wistar rats and compared with sunflower oil (SFO). The calorific value of the DAG-rich oil was estimated to be 6.45 Kcals/g as against 9.25 Kcals/g for SFO. The serum and liver cholesterol and TAG levels in rats fed with 1,3-DAG-rich oil were found to be significantly reduced as compared to rats fed diet containing SFO. We conclude that 1,3-DAG-rich oil is a low calorie fat and exhibits hypolipidemic effects.

AB This study investigated the thermal degradation of a veterinary drug, chloramphenicol, in model solutions (water), as well as in spiked and incurred mussel tissues to understand its fate in the food supply chain. Thermal degradation kinetics followed a first-order model in water (e.g. degradation rate: 0.0018-0.0025 min(-1) at 100 degrees C). After 1 h at 100 degrees C, the percentage degradation in spiked tissues (28.1 +/- 7.1%) was significantly different (p < .05) from the values in water (14.2 +/- 1.6%) and incurred mussel tissues (19.0 +/- 4.1%). Using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution accurate mass tandem mass spectrometry, the resulting degradation products of chloramphenicol were identified in water, spiked and incurred tissues, and were all different. Therefore, although the use of water models and spiking food samples may provide some information, our data confirm that "incurred models" should be systematically implemented to provide reliable information about veterinary drug residue stability for food safety risk assessments.

AB In this study, a three-step extraction method (separately use acetone, hexane, and ethanol as extraction solvent in each step) was conducted to selectively extract three types of krill oils with different compositions. The lipid yields were 5.08% in step 1, 4.80% in step 2, and 9.11% in step 3, with a total of 18.99%. The krill oil extracted with acetone in step 1 (A-KO) contained the lowest contents of phospholipids (PL) (2.32%) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (16.63%), but the highest levels of minor components (505.00 mg/kg of astaxanthin, 29.39 mg/100 g of tocopherols, 34.32 mg/100 g of vitamin A and 27.95 mg/g of cholesterol). By contrast, despite having traces of minor components, the krill oil extracted using ethanol in step 3 (E-KO) was the most abundant in PL (59.52%) and n-3 PUFA (41.74%). The krill oil extracted using hexane in step 2 (H-KO) expressed medium contents of all the testing indices. The oils showed significant differences in the antioxidant capacity (E-KO > H-KO > A-KO) which exhibited positive correlation with the PL content. These results could be used for further development of a wide range of krill oil products with tailor-made functions.

AB The present study was performed to determine crosslinking and oxidative reactions catalyzed by tyrosinase (Tyr), caffeic acid (CA) and their combination with respect to IgE binding potential and conformational structure of shrimp tropomyosin (TM). Cross-links and IgE binding potentials were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, western blot and indirect ELISA. While structural changes were characterized using surface hydrophobicity, ultraviolet (UV), fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies. Maximum reduction in the IgG (37.19%) and IgE binding potentials (49.41%) were observed when treated with 2000 nkat/g Tyr + CA, as indicated by ELISA analyses. These findings correlated well with the denaturation of protein, as evident by slight blue shift and alterations in the ellipticities observed via structural analyses. The results demonstrated that addition of CA mediator with Tyr pronouncedly enhanced crosslinking, and altered the conformational structure, thereby mitigated allergenicity of TM, thus showing promise in developing novel food structures with reduced allergenic potential.

AB PepX aminopeptidase from Streptococcus thermophilus ACA DC 0022, used in Greek Feta cheese manufacturing, was purified. PepX comprises two subunits of equal molecular mass estimated, using SDS-PAGE and native-PAGE electrophoresis, to be 86 kDa.
   The effects of high pressure processing (100-450 MPa, combined with 20-40 degrees C) on purified PepX activity and structure were studied. Activation of the enzyme was observed after processing at 100-200 MPa and 20-30 degrees C. More intense processing conditions led to enzyme inactivation. PepX HP-induced conformational changes were also investigated through application of Circular Dichroism spectroscopy (CD). Pressures up to 200 MPa resulted in a structurally molten globule-like state where PepX maintained its secondary structure but the tertiary structure was substantially affected and enzyme activity increased. Both secondary and tertiary structures were affected severely by higher pressures (450 MPa), which reduced enzyme activity.

AB The recombinant plasmid pPIC9K-bgl1 containing beta-glucosidase bgl1 from Trichoderma viride was constructed by overlapping PCR and integrated into Pichia pastoris KM71. In order to assist the formation of disulfide bonds and thus improve protein folding efficiency, protein disulfide isomerase pdi was co-expressed in the P. pastoris KM71/pPIC9K-bgl1/pPICZ-A-pdi strain, and fermentation in flasks resulted in enzyme activity of 143 U/ml. The enzyme activity of beta-glucosidase reached 1402 U/ml following optimisation of fermentation conditions in a 3.6 l bioreactor. With 80% glucose as substrate, gentiooligosaccharides were synthesised by beta-glucosidase-based reverse hydrolysis. A yield of 130 g/l was achieved with a conversion rate of 16.25%. With 20% glucose and 40% cellobiose as substrates, gentiooligosaccharides were synthesised by transglycosylation with a yield of 116 g/l and a conversion rate of 19.4%.

AB Extracted salmon skin collagen was hydrolysed with the free or immobilized extracellular protease of Vibrio sp. SQS2-3. The hydrolysate exhibited anti-freezing activity (>3 kDa) and antioxidant activity (<3000 Da) after ultrafiltration. The antioxidant peptide was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography and found to scavenge DPPH (73.29 +/- 1.03%), OH (72.73 +/- 3.34%,), and intracellular ROS in HUVECs; protect DNA against oxidation-induced damage; and have an ORAC of 2.78 +/- 0.28 mmol TE/g. The antioxidant peptide fraction was identified using mass spectrometry, and nineteen salmon collagen-sourced peptides were obtained. Of these, the peptide Pro-Met-Arg-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Tyr-His-Tyr is a novel sequence and was the major component; this peptide was shown to have antioxidant activity via the ORAC assay (2.51 +/- 0.14 mmol TE/g). These results suggested that the protease from Vibrio sp. SQS2-3 is suitable for preparation of anti-freezing peptides and antioxidant peptides in a single step and represents a comprehensive use of fish skin collagen.

AB Mercury in foods, in inorganic form [Hg(II)] or as methylmercury (CH3Hg), can have adverse effects. Its elimination from foods is not technologically viable. To reduce human exposure, possible alternatives might be based on reducing its intestinal absorption. This study evaluates the ability of 23 dietary components to reduce the amount of mercury that is absorbed and reaches the bloodstream (bioavailability). We determined their effect on uptake of mercury in Caco-2 cells, a model of intestinal epithelium, exposed to Hg(II) and CH3Hg standards and to swordfish bioaccessible fractions. Cysteine, homocysteine, glutathione, quercetin, albumin and tannic reduce bioavailability of both mercury species. Fe(II), lipoic acid, pectin, epigallocatechin and thiamine are also effective for Hg(II). Some of these strategies also reduce Hg bioavailability in swordfish (glutathione, cysteine, homocysteine). Moreover, extracts and supplements rich in these compounds are also effective. This knowledge may help to define dietary strategies to reduce in vivo mercury bioavailability.

AB Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) virus is a causative agent of enteric disease characterized by watery diarrhea and dehydration. Because PED has high morbidity and mortality, especially in suckling piglets, it causes a great economic loss to swine farms worldwide. Although various PED vaccines have been developed and commercialized, their efficacies are still controversial. In particular, current PED vaccination protocol (vaccination at 2 and 4 weeks before farrowing) may cause stress in pregnant sows. In this study, we compared the effects of PED vaccination timing and frequency for its efficacy by measuring the PED virus-specific antibodies. We found that vaccination at early stages of pregnancy induces similar levels of serum and colostrum antibodies with those at late stages of pregnancy. As the number of vaccinations increased, the amounts of antibody in serum and colostrum, and neutralizing activities increased. Our results provide important information for establishing a more efficient PED vaccination protocol. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background and purpose: Varicella disease is a risk factor for pediatric Arterial Ischemic Stroke (AIS). Isolated case reports have emerged suggesting that varicella vaccination may also pose a risk for AIS. Methods: This retrospective population-based cohort study assessed the risk of AIS in children who received a varicella-containing vaccine, as compared to those who did not. The study cohort consisted of children born between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2013, in the Canadian province of Alberta, where all routine childhood vaccinations are publicly-funded, and recorded in a central immunization repository. These data were linked with hospital discharge abstract data to identify children diagnosed with AIS. A Cox proportional hazard model assessed the risk of AIS in the 12 months following vaccination for children receiving a varicella vaccine between 11 and 23 months of age, as compared to non-vaccinated children. Results: Of the 368,992 children in the cohort, 325,729 were vaccinated with a varicella-containing vaccine between 11 and 23 months of age. The rate of AIS was 7.8 (95% CI 4.810.9) per 100,000 person years at risk in the 12 months following varicella vaccination, as compared to 6.8 (95% CI 1.3-12.2) for children who did not receive a varicella vaccine. The adjusted Hazard Ratio for the risk of AIS, controlling for other AIS risk factors, in vaccinated children as compared to non-vaccinated children was 1.6 (95% CI 0.7-3.7) in the 12 months following vaccination and 1.7 (95% CI 0.5-4.9) in the 30 days following vaccination. Conclusions: Our study found no evidence of an increased risk of AIS following varicella vaccination. This population-based cohort study provides reassurance to parents and clinicians regarding the safety of varicella vaccination. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Allergic diseases are caused by Th2-driven immune responses and their treatment with specific immunotherapy (SIT) leads to immunomodulation via IL10, TGF-beta and Th1/Tr1 shift. This phase IV, open-label clinical trial investigated whether allergies and SIT treatment influenced immune responses to routine vaccination.
   Methods: We studied three groups: 49 allergic patients (allergic group), 21 allergic patients receiving maintenance doses of SIT (SIT group), and 49 non-allergic controls. All subjects received tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) booster vaccines and humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated after one week, four weeks and six months.
   Results: The levels and kinetics of neutralizing TBE-specific antibodies, reflecting protection against TBE, were not significantly different in the three groups. The allergic group showed Th2 polarization pre-booster as indicated by increased TBE-specific IgG1 and elevated mitogen-induced 15 production. Alum-adjuvanted TBE vaccine led to Th2 biased immune responses in the controls, but to no further enhancement of Th2 polarization in the allergic and SIT group. Furthermore, in the SIT group cellular parameters reflected the induction of immunomodulation due to increased Tregs, elevated baseline IL10 and lack of TBE-specific IL5. Importantly, these cellular regulatory responses did not limit the ability to mount sufficient TBE-specific antibodies after the booster. All groups tolerated the vaccine well with no exacerbation of allergic symptoms.
   Conclusion: TBE booster vaccinations were immunogenic and safe in both the allergic and SIT group and contributed to balanced immune responses. Our data indicate that all allergic patients, even when undergoing SIT, should be vaccinated without hesitation and at regular intervals according to standard recommendations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB There is a need to improve the efficacy of the BCG vaccine against human and bovine tuberculosis. Previous data showed that boosting bacilli Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-vaccinated cattle with a recombinant attenuated human type 5 adenovirally vectored subunit vaccine (Ad5-85A) increased BCG protection and was associated with increased frequency of Ag85A-specific CD4(+) T cells post-boosting. Here, the capacity of Ag85A-specific CD4(+) T cell lines - derived before and after viral boosting - to interact with BCG-infected macrophages was evaluated. No difference before and after boosting was found in the capacity of these Ag85A-specific CD4(+) T cell lines to restrict mycobacterial growth, but the secretion of IL-10 in vitro post-boost increased significantly. Furthermore, cell lines derived post-boost had no statistically significant difference in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-12, IFN gamma or TNF alpha) compared to pre-boost lines. In conclusion, the protection associated with the increased number of Ag85A-specific CD4(+) T cells restricting mycobacterial growth may be associated with anti-inflammatory properties to limit immune-pathology.

AB Introduction: Hepatitis A can cause widespread outbreaks. Until 2018, postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) in the United States for individuals >40 years consisted of immune globulin (IG) administered as soon as possible after exposure, ideally within 14 days whereas those aged <= 40 should receive hepatitis A (HepA) vaccine. However, state health departments reporting difficulty quickly accessing and administering IG, costs of higher IG doses and importance of long-term HAV protection prompted CDC to review immunogenicity data for use of HepA vaccine for PEP in older adults. We reviewed literature on use of HepA vaccine in adults >40 years and existing recommendations for HepA vaccine for use as PEP in other countries.
   Methods: We searched PubMed and EMBASE from January 1, 1992-January 7, 2017 using the terms "hepatitis A vaccine*" and "HAV vaccine*." Two reviewers read each abstract and articles were preserved if they included results (seroprotection, mean titers) within 28 days of HepA vaccine administration in adults >40 years. Additionally, we reviewed PEP recommendations from six other jurisdictions.
   Results: A total of 1,039 unique articles were identified, of which eight were retained and two added from references. Three studies included direct comparisons between individuals aged >40 years and those <= 40 years and one other study included three age groups over 40 years, finding lowest immunogenicity in the oldest adults. All found higher proportions seroprotected (definition varied by study) in younger age groups (ages varied by study) at 15 days post-vaccination but similar seroprotection at 30 days. Most other jurisdictions reviewed recommended vaccine alone or in conjunction with IG for PEP in older adults.
   Conclusions: Immunogenicity of HepA vaccine may be diminished in older adults, especially in the very oldest age groups. HepA vaccine should be administered as soon as possible within 14 days after exposure to achieve the best possible immune response. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: Vaccination in pregnancy is an effective method to protect against disease for the pregnant woman, foetus and new born infant. In England, it is recommended that pregnant women are vaccinated against pertussis and influenza. Improvement in the uptake of both pertussis and influenza vaccination among pregnant women is needed to prevent morbidity and mortality for both the pregnant women and unborn child.
   Aim: To identify effective strategies in increasing the uptake of vaccination in pregnancy in high-income countries and to make recommendations for England.
   Methods: A systematic review of peer reviewed literature was conducted using a keyword search strategy applied across six databases (Medline, Embase, Psychlnfo, PubMed, CINAHL and Web of Science). Articles were screened against an inclusion and exclusion criteria and papers included within the review were quality assessed.
   Results and conclusions: Twenty-two articles were included in the review. The majority of the papers included were conducted in the USA and looked at strategies to increase influenza vaccination in pregnancy. There is limited high quality evidence for strategies in high-income countries to increase coverage of pertussis and influenza vaccination in pregnancy. A number of strategies have been found to be effective; reminders about vaccination on antenatal healthcare records, midwives providing vaccination, and education and information provision for healthcare staff and patients. Future interventions to increase vaccination in pregnancy should be evaluated to ensure efficacy and to contribute to the evidence base. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Lipopolysaccharide-specific memory B cell responses to an attenuated

   BANGLADESH; IMMUNITY
AB Background: The single-dose live attenuated vaccine CVD 103-HgR protects against experimental Vibrio cholerae infection in cholera-naive adults for at least 6 months after vaccination. While vaccineinduced vibriocidal seroconversion is associated with protection, vibriocidal titers decline rapidly from their peak 1-2 weeks after vaccination. Although vaccine-induced memory B cells (MBCs) might mediate sustained protection in individuals without detectable circulating antibodies, it is unknown whether oral cholera vaccination induces a MBC response.
   Methods: In a study that enrolled North American adults, we measured lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and cholera toxin (CtxB)-specific MBC responses to PXVX0200 (derived from the CVD 103-HgR strain) and assessed stool volumes following experimental Vibrio cholerae infection. We then evaluated the association between vaccine-induced MBC responses and protection against cholera.
   Results: There was a significant increase in % Cr-specific IgG, % LPS-specific IgG, and % LPS-specific IgA MBCs which persisted 180 days after vaccination as well as a significant association between vaccine-induced increase in % LPS-specific IgA MBCs and lower post-challenge stool volume (r = -0.56, p < 0.001).
   Discussion: Oral cholera vaccination induces antigen-specific MBC responses, and the anamnestic LPS specific responses may contribute to long-term protection and provide correlates of the duration of vaccine-induced protection. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: We compared PCV7 serological response and protection against carriage in infants receiving 3 doses (2, 4, 6 months; 3+0 schedule) to those receiving a booster (12 months; 3+1).
   Methods: A prospective, randomized controlled study, conducted between 2005 and 2008, before PCVs were implemented in Israel. Healthy infants were randomized 1:1:1 to receive 3+1, 3+0 and 0+2 (control group; 12, 18 months doses). Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs were obtained at all visits. Serum serotype-specific IgG concentrations and opsonic activities (OPA) were measured at 2, 7, 13 and 19 months. This study was registered with Current Controlled Trials, Ltd. ISRCTN28445844.
   Results: Overall, 544 infants were enrolled: 3+1 (n = 178), 3+0 (n = 178) and 0+2 (n = 188).
   Post-priming (7 months), antibody concentrations were similar in both groups, except for serotype 18C (higher in 3+0).
   Post-booster (13, 19 months), ELISA and OPA levels were significantly higher in 3+1 than in 3+0 group.
   Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal cultures were positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2673 (543%) visits. Acquisition rates (vaccine and non-vaccine serotypes) were similar for 3+1 and 3+0 groups at 7-30 months and for 0+2 group at 19-30 months.
   Conclusions: PCV7 booster after 3 priming doses increased substantially IgG concentrations but did not further reduced vaccine-serotype nasopharyngeal acquisition, suggesting that protection from pneumococcal carriage does not depend primarily on serum IgG.

AB Background: Extensive clinical investigations are mandatory to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of vaccines. The recording of common adverse events like injection site soreness or general discomfort derives from individual subjective perceptions. Thermal imaging at the injection site possibly provides a non-subjective and a non-invasive approach to supplement this evaluation.
   Results: A protocol for quantified injection-site infrared imaging included 86 participants during a flu vaccine campaign, 40% of whom had a thermal reaction of 1 degrees C; 25-30% had no thermal response. There was little subjective pain reporting and no clinical correlations were observed except with postvaccination erythema.
   Higher responses were linked with advanced age and multiple previous vaccinations.
   Conclusion: Evan if influenza vaccine was only moderately reactogenic, a thermal response was detectable in about 70% of vaccinees, though no relationship to reactogenicity was seen.
   Infrared imaging might however be a prospective tool for individual studies of vaccine-induced vascular responses. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Direct-to-adolescent text messaging may be a consideration for vaccine reminders, including human papilloma virus (HPV), but no studies have explored the minimum age at which parents would allow adolescents to receive a text message.
   Methods: We distributed a survey to parents of 10-17 year olds during any office visit in two practice based research networks in South Carolina and Oklahoma. We asked about parental preference for receiving vaccine reminders for their adolescent, whether they would allow the healthcare provider to directly message their adolescent, and if so, what would be the acceptable minimum age.
   Results: In 546 surveys from 11 practices, parents of females were more supportive of direct-to-teen text message reminders than were parents of males, (75% v. 60%, p < .001). The median age at which parents would allow direct text messages from physicians' offices was 14 in females compared to 15 in males, p = .049. We found a correlation between the child's age and the youngest age at which parents would allow a direct text message. Of the parents who permitted a text message directly to their adolescent, most reported an allowable age higher than their adolescent's current age until the age of 15.
   Conclusion: Our study suggests that direct-to-adolescent text messaging would be allowed by parents for older adolescents. This supports an intervention aimed at older adolescents, such as for receipt of MCV4 dose #2, delayed HPV vaccine series completion and annual influenza vaccination. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: The World Health Organization has targeted rubella virus for elimination regionally. Australia was one of the first countries to implement a nationally funded rubella immunisation program, in 1971, and conducts regular national rubella serosurveillance studies. We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of rubella-specific IgG antibody in the Australian population by age and sex in 2012-2013, to compare the results with three previous serosurveys conducted in 1996-1999, 2002 and 2007 and to estimate the effective reproduction numbers (R-n).
   Methods: This study used 2729 serum and plasma specimens, randomly selected from a specimen bank collected in 2012-2013 across Australia. Age groups included in the sample ranged from 1 to 49 years. Sera were tested for rubella-specific IgG-antibody using the Enzygnost anti-rubella IgG enzyme immunoassay and classified as positive, negative or equivocal according to rubella-specific IgG concentrations of >7 IU/ml, <3 IU/ml and 3-7 IU/ml, respectively.
   Results: The overall proportions seropositive, seronegative and equivocal for rubella-specific IgG were 92.1% (95% CI, 91.0-93.2), 6.7% (95% Cl, 5.7-7.7) and 1.2% (95% Cl, 0.8-1.6), respectively. The proportion of males seropositive was significantly lower than females in the 30-34 (83.1% vs. 96.8%, p = 0.003), 35-39 (86.1% vs. 96.3%, p = 0.02) and 40-44 (86.1% vs. 95.7%, p = 0.03) year age groups. R n for rubella in 2012-2013 was estimated to be 0.33 (95% CI 0.28-0.39).
   Discussion: The 2012-2013 national serosurvey showed levels of rubella-specific IgG seropositivity in the Australian population are relatively high with no evidence of decrease compared to previous serosurveys conducted in 1996-1999, 2002 and 2007. The lower proportion of seropositive males aged 30-44 years likely reflects the initial immunisation program targeting females only. To our knowledge this study represents the longest period of serosurveillance following introduction of a nationally funded rubella immunisation program. The lack of evidence of decreasing rubella-specific IgG seropositivity is therefore reassuring for Australia and other countries with longstanding high vaccine coverage. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB Introduction: Cellular and humoral immune responses are both involved in protection against Plasmodium infections. The only malaria vaccine available, RTS,S, primarily induces short-lived antibodies and targets only a pre-erythrocytic stage antigen. Inclusion of erythrocytic stage targets and enhancing cellular immunogenicity are likely necessary for developing an effective second-generation malaria vaccine. Adenovirus vectors have been used to improve the immunogenicity of protein-based vaccines. However, the clinical assessment of adenoviral-vectored malaria vaccines candidates has shown the induction of robust Plasmodium-specific CD8+ but not CD4+ T cells. Signal peptides (SP) have been used to enhance the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines, but have not been tested in viral vector vaccine platforms.
   Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine if the addition of the SP derived from the murine IgG kappa light chain within a recombinant adenovirus vector encoding a multistage P. vivax vaccine candidate could improve the CD4+ T cell response.
   Methods: In this proof-of-concept study, we immunized CB6F1/J mice with either the recombinant simian adenovirus 36 vector containing the SP (SP-SAd36) upstream from a transgene encoding a chimeric P. vivax multistage protein or the same SAd36 vector without the SP. Mice were subsequently boosted twice with the corresponding recombinant proteins emulsified in Montanide ISA 51 VG. Immunogenicity was assessed by measurement of antibody quantity and quality, and cytokine production by T cells after the final immunization.
   Results: The SP-SAd36 immunization regimen induced significantly higher antibody avidity against the chimeric P. vivax proteins tested and higher frequencies of IFN-gamma and IL-2 CD4+ and CD8+ secreting T cells, when compared to the unmodified SAd36 vector.
   Conclusions: The addition of the murine IgG kappa signal peptide significantly enhances the immunogenicity of a SAd36 vectored P. vivax multi-stage vaccine candidate in mice. The potential of this approach to improve upon existing viral vector vaccine platforms warrants further investigation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: To date, few large-scale comparative effectiveness studies of influenza vaccination have been conducted in Japan, since marketing authorization for influenza vaccines in Japan has been granted based only on the results of seroconversion and safety in small-sized populations in clinical trial phases not on the vaccine effectiveness. We evaluated the clinical effectiveness of influenza vaccination for children aged 1-15 years in Japan throughout four influenza seasons from 2010 to 2014 in the real world setting.
   Methods: We conducted a cohort study using a large-scale claims database for employee health care insurance plans covering more than 3 million people, including enrollees and their dependents. Vaccination status was identified using plan records for the influenza vaccination subsidies.
   The effectiveness of influenza vaccination in preventing influenza and its complications was evaluated. To control confounding related to influenza vaccination, odds ratios (OR) were calculated by applying a doubly robust method using the propensity score for vaccination.
   Results: Total study population throughout the four consecutive influenza seasons was over 116,000. Vaccination rate was higher in younger children and in the recent influenza seasons. Throughout the four seasons, the estimated ORs for influenza onset were statistically significant and ranged from 0.797 to 0.894 after doubly robust adjustment. On age stratification, significant ORs were observed in younger children. Additionally, ORs for influenza complication outcomes, such as pneumonia, hospitalization with influenza and respiratory tract diseases, were significantly reduced, except for hospitalization with influenza in the 2010/2011 and 2012/2013 seasons.
   Conclusions: We confirmed the clinical effectiveness of influenza vaccination in children aged 1-15 years from the 2010/2011 to 2013/2014 influenza seasons. Influenza vaccine significantly prevented the onset of influenza and was effective in reducing its secondary complications. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Defining correlates of T cell mediated protection is important in order to accelerate the development of efficient T cell based vaccines conferring long-term immunity.
   Extensive studies have provided important insight regarding the characteristics and functional properties of the effector and memory CD8 T cells induced by viral vector based vaccines. However, long-term protection has been difficult to achieve with T cell inducing vaccines, and the determinants underlying this loss in protection over time are still not fully defined.
   In this study we analyzed different parameters of the CD8 T cell response as a function of time after vaccination with a human serotype 5 adenovector expressing the glycoprotein (GP) of LCMV tethered to the MHC class II-associated invariant chain. Using this vector we have previously found that CD8 T cells mediate protection from challenge with GP-expressing Listeria monocytogenes at 60 days post vaccination, but only little protection after further 60 days, and we now confirm this observation. A comparison of vaccine-primed CD8 T cells early and late after vaccination revealed a minor decline in the overall numbers of antigen specific memory CD8 T cells during this interval. More importantly, we also observed phenotypic changes over time with a distinct decline in the frequency and number of KLRG1+ CD8 T cells, and, notably, adoptive transfer studies confirmed that memory CD8 T cells expressing KLRG1 are central to protection from systemic L monocytogenes infection. Together these findings imply that multiple factors including changes in memory T cell numbers and phenotypic composition over time influence the longevity of CD8 T-cell mediated protection.

AB Background: Routine childhood immunization coverage has been low in northern Nigeria. While local authorities and international partners have been working hard to improve coverage, population preferences for interventions have not been documented. This study aimed to understand parents' preferences and identify possible interventions to improve uptake of childhood immunization.
   Methods: Preferences for immunization interventions were elicited using a best-worst scaling (BWS) instrument among parents with children under five. We explored the value of six program attributes (each varying across three levels) identified through a literature review and engagement with local stakeholders. In each of 18 hypothetical programs identified through a main effect orthogonal design, respondents selected the best and worst attributes that may facilitate vaccination of children. Assuming sequential best-worst responses, we used conditional logit to estimate preferences. We employed latent class analysis (LCA) to categorize and examine respondents' preferences across interventions.
   Results: 97 men and 101 women in 198 households were surveyed. The most preferred level for each attribute included door-to-door vaccinations, free food supplements, bundling with nutritional support programs, involvement of religious leaders, information dissemination through media campaigns, and strengthening of health services by the government. Three types of preferences were recognized in the LCA. The value-driven group (14%) characterized by youngest age, predominantly female, and lower education perceived bundled services with food and nutritional programs as the most important feature of an intervention. Convenience and information seekers (28%) characterized by oldest age and the lowest employment preferred door-to-door vaccinations and media campaigns. The remaining complacent group (58%), characterized by highest education and highest employment, did not show strong preferences to any intervention compared to the other two groups.
   Conclusions: Routine immunization programs should consider joining forces with food and nutritional programs to improve vaccination uptake. Incorporating door-to-door visits and media campaigns to target older and unemployed populations may increase childhood immunization uptake in northern Nigeria. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We have shown that the live-attenuated HSV-1 VC2 vaccine strain is unable to establish latency in vaccinated animals and produces a robust immune response capable of completely protecting mice against lethal vaginal HSV-1 or HSV-2 infections. The guinea pig represents the best small animal model of genital HSV-2 disease. Reported here, twenty-one female Hartley guinea pigs received intramuscular injection with either the VC2 vaccine, or equal volume of conditioned tissue culture media. Animals received 2 booster vaccinations at 21 day intervals following the initial vaccination. After vaccination, animals were challenged with the highly virulent HSV-2 (G) strain. Histologically, VC2 vaccinated animals had little to no apparent inflammation/disease following challenge. Unvaccinated animals developed moderate to severe erosive and ulcerative vaginitis. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR analysis in VC2 vaccinated and challenged animals identified transcriptional signatures of Th17 and regulatory Tr1 cells associated with the inflammatory response primed by VC2 vaccination. Treatment of cultured human vaginal epithelial cells (VK2 cells) with a combination of IL-17A and IL-22 resulted in the significant induction of beta-defensin 3 expression. Further, treatment of VK2 cells with IL-17A, IL-22, IL-36 or beta-defensin 3 resulted in diminished HSV-2 replication. Overall, these results suggest that intramuscular vaccination with the live-attenuated vaccine VC2 primes a mucosal immune response predisposing the adaptive expression of transcripts associated with a Th17 response to challenge and these responses contribute to antiviral immunity.

AB Objective: To update a previous assessment of birth defects among infants born to active duty U.S. military mothers who received the 2009-2010 pandemic HI NI vaccine, in comparison to the 2008-2009 seasonal influenza vaccine, during pregnancy. Here, we updated the previous comparative analyses with a more refined definition for birth defects using an additional year of follow-up data from both inpatient and outpatient medical encounters.
   Methods: The study population included 15,510 live born infants born to active duty mothers vaccinated during pregnancy with either the 2009-2010 pandemic HI NI vaccine (n = 9033) or the 2008-2009 seasonal influenza vaccine (n = 6477). Birth defect cases were defined as those infants who received a birth defect diagnosis on one inpatient record or two outpatient records on different days within the first year of life. Multivariable logistic regression models were conducted to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between birth defects and maternal vaccination during pregnancy with pandemic H1N1 vaccine versus seasonal influenza vaccine.
   Results: Infants born to mothers vaccinated during pregnancy with the pandemic H1N1 vaccine, versus the seasonal influenza vaccine, were not at increased odds of birth defects in univariable (OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 0.95-1.34) or multivariable (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.96-1.35) models. Findings were not significant when further limited to first trimester exposure. Multivariable models were adjusted for infant sex and plurality; maternal age, race/ethnicity, marital status, service branch, military rank, and occupation; timing of vaccination; and receipt of vaccination(s) not routinely recommended during pregnancy.
   Conclusion: Comparable to our previous analyses assessing birth defects diagnosed at birth, no significant association was found between the pandemic HI NI vaccination during pregnancy and birth defects, versus the seasonal influenza vaccine. These findings are reassuring and provide additional support for H1N1-containing seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Influenza vaccination rates among children are low and novel strategies are needed to raise coverage. We measured the impact of school-located influenza vaccination (SLIV) on coverage, examined whether SLIV substitutes for practice-based influenza vaccination ("substitution"), and estimated whether a second year of experience with SLIV increases its impact.
   Methods: We implemented a stepped wedge study design with schools as clusters. In Year 1, we randomly allocated schools to SLIV or control. In Year 2, all schools performed SLIV. We used emails (suburban schools) or backpack fliers (both urban and suburban schools) to notify parents, and offered web-based (suburban) or paper-based vaccination (urban) consent forms. Local health department nurses administered SLIV vaccinations and billed insurers. We analyzed state immunization registry data to measure influenza vaccination rates.
   Results: 42 schools (38,078 children) participated over 2 years. Overall vaccination rates were 5 and 7 percentage points higher among SLIV- school children versus control-school children in suburban (aOR 1.36, 95% CI 1.25-1.49 in Years 1-2 SLIV vs. Year 1 control schools) and urban schools (aOR 1.22, 95% CI 1.10-1.36), respectively, adjusting for prior year's vaccination and other covariates. While no substitution occurred among children attending suburban schools, some substitution occurred among children attending urban schools, although overall vaccination rates were still higher in urban schools due to SLIV. Compared to an initial year of SLIV, more children were vaccinated in a second year of SLIV at urban (8.3% vs. 6.8%, aOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.04-1.47) but not suburban schools (3.5% vs. 2.7%, aOR 1.24, 95% Cl 0.981.57).
   Conclusions: In this stepped wedge trial, SLIV increased overall influenza vaccination rates in suburban and urban schools. Some substitution for primary care vaccination occurred in urban settings. A second year of SLIV expanded its reach slightly in urban schools. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aims: Clinical guidelines for management of infants with fever but no evident focus of infection recommend that those aged 1-3 months with a white cell count >15 x 10(9)/1 have a full septic screen and be admitted for parenteral antibiotics. However, there is limited information about leucocyte changes following routine immunization, a common cause of fever. We investigated white cell counts shortly after routine immunization in Ugandan infants under 3 months of age.
   Methods: White cell counts were measured in 212 healthy infants following routine immunizations (DTwP-HepB-Hib, oral polio and pneumococcal conjugate 7 vaccines) received prior to 3 months of age.
   Results: Mean leucocyte counts increased from 9.03 x 10(9)/1 (95% confidence interval 8.59-9.47 x 10(9)/1) pre-immunizations to 16.46 x 10(9)/1 (15.4-17.52 x 10(9)/1) at one-day post-immunizations at 6 weeks of age, and 15.21 x 10(9)/1 (14.07-1636 x 10(9)/1) at one-day post-immunizations at 10 weeks of age. The leucocytosis was primarily a neutrophilia, with neutrophil percentages one-day post-immunization of 49% at 6 weeks of age and 46% at 10 weeks of age. White cell parameters returned to baseline by two-days post-immunization. No participant received antibiotics when presenting with isolated fever postimmunization and all remained well at follow-up.
   Conclusions: In our study almost half the children <3 months old presenting with fever but no evident focus of infection at one-day post-immunization met commonly used criteria for full septic screen and admission for parenteral antibiotics, despite having no serious bacterial infection. These findings add to the growing body of literature that questions the utility of white blood cell measurement in identification of young infants at risk of serious bacterial infections, particularly in the context of recent immunizations, and suggest that further exploration of the effect of different immunization regimes on white cell counts is needed.

AB Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children twelve months of age or younger and a significant cause of lower respiratory disease in older adults. As various clinical and preclinical candidates advance, cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) and non-human primates (NHP) continue to play a valuable role in RSV vaccine development, since both animals are semi-permissive to human RSV (HRSV). However, appropriate utilization of the models is critical to avoid mis-interpretation of the preclinical findings. Using a multimodality imaging approach; a fluorescence based optical imaging technique for the cotton rat and a nuclear medicine based positron emission tomography (PET) imaging technique for monkeys, we demonstrate that many common practices for intranasal immunization in both species result in inoculum delivery to the lower respiratory tract, which can result in poor translation of outcomes from the preclinical to the clinical setting. Using these technologies we define a method to limit the distribution of intranasally administered vaccines solely to the upper airway of each species, which includes volume restrictions in combination with injectable anesthesia. We show using our newly defined methods for strict intranasal immunization that these methods impact the immune responses and efficacy observed when compared to vaccination methods resulting in distribution to both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. These data emphasize the importance of well-characterized immunization methods in the preclinical assessment of intranasally delivered vaccine candidates.

AB In this study, the potential of N-trimethyl chitosan (TMC) nanoparticles as a carrier system for the nasal delivery of the r4M2e center dot HSP70c, as an M2e-based universal recombinant influenza virus vaccine candidate, was investigated in mice. The anti-M2e specific cellular and humoral immune responses were assessed and the protective efficacy against a 90% lethal dose (LD90) of influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) in a mice model was evaluated.
   Our results showed that the intranasal immunization of mice with r4M2e center dot HSP70c+TMC rather than the control groups, r4M2e+TMC, r4M2e and PBS (Phosphate buffer saline), significantly elevated both longevity and serum level of the total M2e-specific IgG antibody with a significant shift in the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio toward IgG2a, induced a Thl skewed humoral and cellular immune responses, increased IFN-gamma, IgG, and IgA in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALE), and promoted the proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes with lower morbidity and mortality rate against viral challenge.
   In conclusion, based on evidence to our finding, nasal vaccination with r4M2e center dot HSP70c antigen encapsulated into N-Trimethyl Chitosan (TMC) nanoparticulate system showed to induce a long lasting M2e-specific humoral and cellular immune responses and also provided full protection against a 90% lethal dose (LD90) of the influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). It seems, protective immunity following intranasal administration of r4M2e could be resulted by the cooperation of both adjuvants, TMC and HSP70c. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Vaccination Program for US-bound Refugees (VPR) currently provides one or two doses of some age-specific Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)-recommended vaccines to US-bound refugees prior to departure.
   Methods: We quantified and compared the full vaccination costs for refugees using two scenarios: (1) the baseline of no VPR and (2) the current situation with VPR. Under the first scenario, refugees would be fully vaccinated after arrival in the United States. For the second scenario, refugees would receive one or two doses of selected vaccines before departure and complete the recommended vaccination schedule after arrival in the United States. We evaluated costs for the full vaccination schedule and for the subset of vaccines provided by VPR by four age-stratified groups; all costs were reported in 2015 US dollars. We performed one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses and break-even analyses to evaluate the robustness of results.
   Results: Vaccination costs with the VPR scenario were lower than costs of the scenario without the VPR for refugees in all examined age groups. Net cost savings per person associated with the VPR were ranged from $225.93 with estimated Refugee Medical Assistance (RMA) or Medicaid payments for domestic costs to $498.42 with estimated private sector payments. Limiting the analyses to only the vaccines included in VPR, the average costs per person were 56% less for the VPR scenario with RMA/Medicaid payments. Net cost savings with the VPR scenario were sensitive to inputs for vaccination costs, domestic vaccine coverage rates, and revaccination rates, but the VPR scenario was cost savings across a range of plausible parameter estimates.
   Conclusions: VPR is a cost-saving program that would also reduce the risk of refugees arriving while infected with a vaccine preventable disease. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Newly arrived refugees are offered vaccinations during domestic medical examinations. Vaccination practices and costs for refugees have not been described with recent implementation of the overseas Vaccination Program for U.S.-bound Refugees (VPR). We describe refugee vaccination during the domestic medical examination and the estimated vaccination costs from the US government perspective in selected U.S. clinics.
   Methods: Site-specific vaccination processes and costs were collected from 16 clinics by refugee health partners in three states and one private academic institution. Vaccination costs were estimated from the U.S. Vaccines for Children Program and Medicaid reimbursement rates during fiscal year 2015.
   Results: All clinics reviewed overseas vaccination records before vaccinating, but all records were not transferred into state immunization systems. Average vaccination costs per refugee varied from $120 to $211 by site. The total average cost of domestic vaccination was 15% less among refugees arriving from VPR- vs. nonVPR-participating countries during a single domestic visit.
   Conclusion: Our findings indicate that immunization practices and costs vary between clinics, and that clinics adapted their vaccination practices to accommodate VPR doses, yielding potential cost savings. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Many countries including Japan have adapted acellular pertussis vaccines combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (DTaP). DTaP vaccine coverage is approximately >90%, but pertussis re-emergence has been observed since 2000 in Japan. In the present study, anti-pertussis antibodies were investigated among school-age children and adolescents from 2013 to 2015. The positive rate of anti-pertussis toxin (PT) antibodies was higher among children aged 12-13 years (60.0%. 95%Cl; 56.0-63.9%) in 2014 and 18-19 years (73.0%. 95%Cl; 61.4-82.6%) in 2013, compared with 6-7 years (47.1%. 95%CI; 40.7-53.6%). The mean PT antibody titer was higher among children aged 12-13 years (23.8 95%CI; 21.9-25.8) in 2014 and 18-19 years (29.3 EU/mI. 95%Cl; 23.0-35.6) in 2013, compared with 6-7 years (18.3 EU/mI. 95%Cl; 15.5-21.2). Distributions of pertussis antibodies and mean titers at their same grade of school-age were similar from 2013 to 2015. Although school-age children were immunized with 4 doses of DTaP, the data suggested the decay of vaccine-acquired immunity and possibility of asymptomatic infection in school age, indicating the additional DTaP vaccination before the entry of elementary school, preventing household contact.

AB Upon confrontation with unfavourable conditions, plants invoke a very complex set of biochemical and physiological reactions and alter gene expression patterns to combat the situations. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNA, contribute extensively in regulation of gene expression through translation inhibition or degradation of their target mRNAs during such conditions. Therefore, identification of miRNAs and their targets holds importance in understanding the regulatory networks triggered during stress. Structure and sequence similarity based in silico prediction of miRNAs in Cajanus cajan L. (Pigeonpea) draft genome sequence has been carried out earlier. These annotations also appear in related GenBank genome sequence entries. However, there are no reports available on context dependent miRNA expression and their targets in pigeonpea. Therefore, in the present study we addressed these questions computationally, using pigeonpea EST sequence information. We identified five novel pigeonpea miRNA precursors, their mature forms and targets. Interestingly, only one of these miRNAs (miR1691-3p) was identified earlier in draft genome sequence. We then validated expression of these miRNAs, experimentally. It was also observed that these miRNAs show differential expression patterns in response to Fusarium inoculation indicating their biotic stress responsive nature. Overall these results will help towards better understanding the regulatory network of defense during pigeonpea-pathogen interactions and role of miRNAs in the process.

AB Finger millet (Eleusine coracana (L.) Geartn.) is one of the important small millets serves as a food security crop because of its high nutritional values. The complex tetraploid genome of finger millet requires a large number of informative, functional DNA markers for different applications in genetics and breeding. Yet, less number of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers have been developed from expressed sequence tags in finger millet. In the present study, 56 new genic SSR markers were developed from publicly available drought related ESTs. The 43 polymorphic markers were used to evaluate polymorphism, revealed a range of PIC value 0.41 to 0.79. Our results suggest that, analyzed genotypes have high genetic diversity with an average gene diversity (h) of 0.176 and Shannon's information index (I) of 0.315. We conclude that there was a higher gene exchange within populations, by the value of overall gene flow (Nm) of 0.7721. The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean and neighbor joining dendrogram generated three main clusters to differentiate genotypes and these results were also confirmed by PCA and PCoA analysis. The high genetic diversity (77%) was found within the populations in the analysis of molecular variance. A Bayesian model-based cluster analysis evidenced a high extent of admixture between the gene pools from the different geographical origins. Population based cluster analyses pointed out a strong pattern of 'isolation by distance'. Overall, these results underscored that this study showed a significantly high level of polymorphism, adequate genetic diversity and population structure which expand the modern genetic resources and its utility in various applications in genetics and genomics including association mapping and breeding.

AB The anticancer drug bicalutamide was co-milled with either Macrogol 6000 or Poloxamer 407, and the physicochemical parameters that drive the phase transition of binary systems and influence the dissolution modification of bicalutamide were studied. Milled binary systems with reduced particle size were assessed by scanning electron microscopy and laser diffraction measurements. The results of thermal analysis supported by X-ray diffractometry confirmed the reduction of the crystallinity of bicalutamide co-milled with Macrogol 6000. Infrared spectroscopy was used to determine the molecular structure of the samples and indicated weak interactions between drug and polymer molecules. Two mechanisms were identified and were involved in up to 11-fold enhanced dissolution. The first one was based on improved wettability due to a decreased contact angle in samples containing Macrogol 6000. The second one relied on the solubilization of bicalutamide within nanoaggregates formed by Poloxamer 407 that resulted from its surface activity. This finding was confirmed with fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy assays. Given the dissolution rate-limited absorption combined with the reduced bioavailability of bicalutamide as a BCS class II drug, the assessment of the mechanisms driving the increase in drug dissolution is of particular importance in drug development.

AB Oral administration of insulin increases patient comfort and could improve glycemic control thanks to the hepatic first passage. However, challenges remain. The current approach uses poly (D, lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs), an effective drug carrier system with a long acting profile. However, this system presents a bioavailability of less than 20% for insulin encapsulation. In this context, physico-chemical parameters like surface charge could play a critical role in NP uptake by the intestinal barrier. Therefore, we developed a simple method to modulate NP surface charge to test its impact on uptake in vitro and finally on NP efficiency in vivo. Various NPs were prepared in the presence (+) or absence (-) of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and/or coated with chitosan chloride. In vitro internalization was tested using epithelial culture of Caco-2 or using a co-culture (Caco-2/RevHT29MTX) by flow cytometry. NPs were then administered by oral route using a pharmaceutical complex vector (100 or 250 UI/kg) in a diabetic rat model.
   SDS-NPs (-42 +/- 2 mV) were more negatively charged than -PVA-NPs (-22 +/- 1 mV) and chitosan-coated NPs were highly positively charged (56 +/- 2 mV) compared to + PVA particles (-2 +/- 1 mV), which were uncharged. In the Caco-2 model, NP internalization was significantly improved by using negatively charged NPs (SDS NPs) compared to using classical NPs (+ PVA NPs) and chitosan-coated NPs. Finally, the efficacy of insulin SDS-NPs was demonstrated in vivo (100 or 250 UI insulin/kg) with a reduction of blood glucose levels in diabetic rats. Formulation of negatively charged NPs represents a promising approach to improve NP uptake and insulin bioavailability for oral delivery.

AB In recent years, to guarantee a quality-by-design approach to the development of pharmaceutical products, it is important to identify properties of raw materials and excipients in order to determine critical process parameters and critical quality attributes. Feedback obtained from real-time analyses using various process analytical technology (PAT) tools has been actively investigated. In this study, in situ monitoring using low-frequency (LF) Raman spectroscopy (10-200 cm(-1)), which may have higher discriminative ability among polymorphs than near-infrared spectroscopy and conventional Raman spectroscopy (200-1800 cm(-1)), was investigated as a possible application to PAT. This is because LF-Raman spectroscopy obtains information about intermolecular and/or lattice vibrations in the solid state. The monitoring results obtained from Furosemide/Nicotinamide cocrystal indicate that LF-Raman spectroscopy is applicable to in situ monitoring of suspension and fluidized bed granulation processes, and is an effective technique as a PAT tool to detect the conversion risk of cocrystals. LF-Raman spectroscopy is also used as a PAT tool to monitor reactions, crystallizations, and manufacturing processes of drug substances and products. In addition, a sequence of conversion behaviors of Furosemide/Nicotinamide cocrystals was determined by performing in situ monitoring for the first time.

AB Pharmacotherapy of tuberculosis is potentially more efficient when delivered by the inhaled route than by the current oral and/or parenteral routes due to the higher concentration of drug reaching the primary region of infection in the lungs. This study investigated the influence of the amino acid L-leucine alone and in combination with the phospholipid, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), on the aerosolization behaviour of the anti-TB drugs, pyrazinamide and moxifloxacin HCl. Spray dried powders of pyrazinamide (P), moxifloxacin (M) alone and in combination with 10% L-leucine (PL and ML) and 10% DPPC (PLD and MLD) were produced. The particle sizes of all powders except P were in the inhalable size range (< 5 mu m) but differ in their morphology in presence of the excipients. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) revealed the migration of surface active L-leucine and DPPC onto the surface of the particles during the spray drying process. The aerosolization from a dry powder inhaler, Aerolizer (R), using a Next Generation Impactor revealed fine particle fraction (FPF) values for P, PL and PLD of 18.7 +/- 3.4%, 53.0 +/- 3.2% and 74.5 +/- 5.3% respectively while FPF values for M, ML and MLD were 55.6 +/- 3.3%, 74.7 +/- 4.7% and 74.1 +/- 1.3% respectively. In conclusion, the differences in the aerosolization behaviours of the pyrazinamide and moxifloxacin spray dried powders with and without excipients was a combination of difference in the surface morphology and surface composition.

AB Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to ischemic tissue repair by paracrine secretion up-regulated by hypoxia. In this study we use novel nanoparticles (NPs) as carriers for a controlled release of EPC secretome (CM) to improve their angiogenic properties. The in vivo effect in ischemic hindlimb rat model was evaluated, comparing hypoxic EPC-CM-NPs with hypoxic EPC-CM alone. A proteomic characterization of hypoxic CM and the in vitro effect on endothelial cells (HUVECs) were also performed. Up to 647 protein, 17 of which with angiogenic properties, were upregulated by hypoxia. Moreover, hypoxic EPC-CM significantly promoted capillary-like structures on Matrigel. A significant increase of blood perfusion in ischemic limbs at 2 weeks with EPCCM-loaded NPs as compared to both EPC-CM and control and a significant increase of capillary formation were observed. The use of EPC-CM-NPs significantly improved neoangiogenesis in vivo, underlining the advantages of controlled release in regenerative medicine.

AB In this study, we prepared paclitaxel (PTX) loaded bovine serum albumin (BSA) microparticles (MPs) of different sizes (0.5, 1.0, and 3.0 mu m) and converted them into dry powders (DPs) of a uniform size (similar to 5.0 mu m) through spray-drying techniques. The aim of preparing different sized PTX-MPs is to investigate the size-based in vivo biodistribution and retention of PTX in the lungs after intratracheal administration. Following the in vitro characterizations, the anti-tumor efficacy of the DPs containing differently sized PTX-BSA-MPs administered through intratracheal insufflation was compared with intravenously administered PTX solution (Taxol). While the fastest drug release was found for the 0.5 mu m group, the 1.0 and 3.0 mu m groups showed the highest antitumor efficiency in vivo. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the initial particle size of the incorporated particles, i.e., MPs, is crucial for the anti-tumor efficacy of DPs administered by inhalation, and the initial particle size should be regarded as one of the key factors in the development and quality control of such preparations.

AB The present work addresses the development and characterization of epsilon-Poly-L-Lysine/pDNA polyplexes and evaluation for their improved transfection efficacy and safety as compared to polyplexes prepared using Poly-L-Lysine and SuperFect (R). Self-assembling polyplexes were prepared by varying the N/P ratio to obtain the optimum size, a net positive zeta potential and gel retardation. The stability in presence of DNase I and serum was assured using gel retardation assay. Their appreciable uptake in MCF-7 and 3.5, 3.79 and 4.79-fold higher transfection compared to PLL/pDNA polyplexes and 1.60, 1.53 and 1.79-fold higher transfection compared to SuperFect (R)/pDNA polyplexes in MCF-7, HeLa and HEK-293 cell lines respectively, affirmed the enhanced transfection of epsilon-PLL/pDNA polyplexes which was well supported with in vivo transfection and gene expression studies. The < 8% in vitro hemolysis and > 98% viability of MCF-7, HeLa and HEK-293 cells in presence of epsilon-PLL/pDNA polyplexes addressed their safety, which was also ensured using in vivo toxicity studies, where hemocompatibility, unaltered levels of biochemical markers and histology of vital organs confirmed epsilon-PLL to be an effective and safer alternative for non-viral genetic vectors.

AB IR780, a molecule with a strong optical absorption and emission in the near infrared (NIR) region, is receiving an increasing attention from researchers working in the area of cancer treatment and imaging. Upon irradiation with NIR light, IR780 can produce reactive oxygen species as well as increase the body temperature, thus being a promising agent for application in cancer photodynamic and photothermal therapy. However, IR780's poor water solubility, fast clearance, acute toxicity and low tumor uptake may limit its use. To overcome such issues, several types of nanomaterials have been used to encapsulate and deliver IR780 to tumor cells. This mini-review is focused on the application of IR780 based nanostructures for cancer imaging, and photothermal, photodynamic and combinatorial therapies.

AB In the present paper we review different aspects of the crystallization of amorphous compounds in relation to specificities of the nucleation and growth rates. Its main purpose is: i) to underline the interest of a scaling analysis of recrystallization kinetics to identify similarities or disparities of experimental kinetic regimes. ii) to highlight the intrinsic link between the nucleation rate and growth rate with a temperature dependent characteristic transformation time tau(T), and a characteristic size xi(T). The consequences on the influence of the sample size on kinetics of crystallization is considered. The significance of size effect and confinement for amorphous stabilization in the pharmaceutical sciences is discussed.

AB Sorafenib (SFN), a hydrophobic anticancer drug, has several limitations predominantly poor aqueous solubility and hepatic first-pass effect, limiting its oral delivery that results into several other complications. Present study aims to develop Sorafenib loaded polymersomes using poly butadiene block poly ethylene oxide (PB-b-PEO), an amphiphilic co-block polymer. Prior to drug loading, critical aggregate concentration (CAC) of polymer was calculated for stable formulation synthesis. The developed SFN loaded PB-b-PEO polymersomes (SFN-PB-b-PEO, test formulation) characterized by DLS and cryo-TEM showed particle size 282 nm, polydispersity (PDI) of less than 0.29 and membrane thickness of about 20 nm. SFN-PB-b-PEO polymersomes demonstrated encapsulation efficiency of 71% and showed sustained drug release up to 144 h. Formulation remained stable for 3 months in suspension form. In vitro cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells showed 1.7 folds improved toxicity compared to SFN suspension. In addition, oral administration of SFN-PB-b-PEO polymersomes in BALB/c mice showed increased C-max and AUC(0-96) by 1.7 and 2.77-fold respectively (p < 0.05) compared to those of SFN suspension (reference formulation). Findings suggest that the SFN-PB-b-PEO polymersomes can be a potential candidate for oral delivery of SFN.

AB Flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) is a controlled antisolvent precipitation process that has proven effective for consistent production of drug nanoparticles with a defined mean particle size and narrow particle size distribution. However, physical instability of the generated nanoparticles remains a major challenge in the application of this technology in pharmaceutical formulation. Aimed at resolving this problem, the present study has investigated the FNP process and associated stabilization mechanism of itraconazole (ITZ) nanoparticles through in-depth nanoparticle characterization. Results showed that ITZ nanoparticles could be reproducibly produced with a mean particle size < 100 nm and a polydispersity index < 0.2 in the presence of amphiphilic stabilizers (ASs). Surface analysis of freshly formed nanoparticles by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed initially a disordered packing structure and subsequently a time-dependent molecular rearrangement of incorporated AS towards a micelle-like structure. The faster the molecular rearrangement of AS, the more stable the nanoparticles, as monitored by the change in particle size with time. These findings may have important implications for the selection of effective ASs for formulating stable drug nanoparticles. The present study is the first of its kind to demonstrate the utility of XPS to track the molecular transport of stabilizers in rapidly generated nanoparticles.

AB It is difficult to effectively eradicate C. albicans using traditional antifungal agents, mainly because the low permeability of the C. albicans cell wall creates strong drug resistance. The aim of this study was to investigate the synergistic fungicidal effect and the underlying mechanisms of low-frequency and low-intensity ultrasound combined with a treatment of amphotericin B-loaded nanoparticles (AmB-NPs) against C. albicans. AmB-NPs were prepared by a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) double emulsion method. C. albicans was treated by AmB-NPs combined with 42 kHz ultrasound irradiation at an intensity of 0.30 W/cm(2) for 15 min. The results demonstrate that the application of ultrasound enhanced the antibacterial effectiveness of AmB-NPs (P < 0.01), and the antifungal efficiency increased significantly with increasing AmB concentration of drug-loaded nanoparticles under ultrasonic irradiation. Additionally, the mycelial morphology of C. albicans suffered from the most severe damage and loss of normal microbial morphology after the combined treatment of AmB-NPs and ultrasound, as revealed by electron microscope. Furthermore, we verified the safe use of low-frequency ultrasound on exposed skin and discussed the potential mechanism of ultrasound enhanced fungicidal activity. The results reveal that the mechanism may be associated with the ultrasound cavitation effect and an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species.

AB Paclitaxel (PTX) belongs to a class of taxane anti-tumor drug used for the clinic treatment of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, and so on. PTX has poor water solubility and oral bioavailability. It is generally administered via intravenous (i.v.) infusion. Traditional PTX injectable preparations contain Cremophor-EL and ethanol to improve its solubility, which would result in adverse reactions like severe hypersensitivity, neutropenia, etc. Adverse reactions can be reduced only by complicated pretreatment with glucocorticoid and antihistamines drugs and followed by PTX slow infusion for three hours, which has brought significant inconvenience to the patients. Though, a new-generation PTX formulation, Abraxane, free of Cremophor-EL and ethanol, is still being administrated by frequent i.v. infusions and extremely expensive. Therefore, non-injection administration of PTX is urgently needed to avoid the side effects as well as reduce inconvenience to the patients. Recently, a variety of non-injection drug delivery systems (DDSs) of PTX have been developed. This review aims to discuss the progress of non-injectable administration systems of PTX, including oral administration systems, vaginal administration systems, implantable DDSs, transdermal DDSs and intranasal administration for the future study and clinical applications.

AB The self-organizing complexes with hyaluronic acid (HA) and polydopamine (PDA), an adhesion mediator via hydrogen bonding, were investigated for use as protein drug carriers. The complexes were prepared with HA of different molecular weights (20 kDa and 200 kDa) and various molar ratios of dopamine and lysozyme, a model protein. Dopamine-conjugated HA (HADA)/PDA complexes were prepared by one-pot synthesis by relying on the self-polymerization of dopamine under oxidative, weakly basic conditions. Lysozyme was bound via coacervation and hydrogen bonding into HADA/PDA complexes. Complex diameters were 100-300 nm, based on transmission electron microscopy image and dynamic light scattering findings. Circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry showed that a stable protein formulation was obtained without degradation while preserving the thermal characteristics of lysozyme. Transition temperature (T-m) of the HADA/PDA/lysozyme complex (1: 10: 0.05 ratio) was 72.45 degrees C, which is close to the T-m of the native lysozyme (72.46 degrees C). The efficacy of complexes was also evaluated to protect the structural stability of lysozyme. Lysozyme (0.33 mol) was complexed with HA monomer; consequently, lysozyme activity in the HADA/PDA complex was not affected from short-term degradation. Protein encapsulation and efficacy of the formulations showed successful complexation as protein carriers, thus suggesting an effective combinatory protein delivery system.

AB Silk proteins are synthesized and secreted by the silk gland. The differential gene expression in it leads to different silk yield among various silkworm strains. As crucial factors, microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate protein synthesis at post-transcriptional level in silk gland. MiRNAs expression level in the silk gland of three silkworm strains (Jingsong, Lan10 and Dazao) was analyzed and 33 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were discovered between JingSong (JS) and Lan10 (L10), 60 DEMs between JS and Dazao, 54 DEMs between L10 and Dazao respectively. The DEMs target genes were predicted combing with two different methods and their functions were annotated according to gene ontology. Our previous studies showed that a batch of genes related to silk yield were identified in JS and L10 strains by comparative transcriptome and quantitative trait loci (QTL) method. Thirteen DEMs whose target genes are related to protein biosynthesis processes were screened by combining with these researches. Twelve DEMs potentially regulate nineteen genes which exist in our QTL results. Six common DEMs potentially regulate the genes in both of previous results. Finally, five DEMs were selected to verify their expression levels between JS and L10 by qRT-PCR, which showed similar difference as the results of small RNA-sequencing. MiRNAs in the silk gland may directly affect silk protein biosynthesis in different silkworm strains. In current work, we identified a batch of DEMs which potentially regulate the genes related to silk yield. Further functionally study of these miRNAs will contribute to improve varieties and boost the silk yield. Our research provides a basis for studying these miRNAs and their functions in silk production.

AB Purpose: To investigate whether calpastatin (CAST) gene polymorphisms are in association with keratoconus (KC) in Han Chinese population.
   Methods: Four SNPs (rs4434401, rs7704167, rs26504, and rs10053056) in CAST gene were genotyped in 120 unrelated Han Chinese KC patients and 305 age and gender matched healthy controls, using TaqMan SNP genotyping method. PLINK and LDmatrix software was used for data analysis.
   Results: SNP rs4434401, whose contribution to KC susceptibility has been established in Caucasians, still kept its effect in our population. The C allele frequency of rs4434401 was markedly higher in cases (27.7%) than in the controls (20.7%, P = 0.03654, OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.02-2.11). The genotype distribution of rs4434401 showed marginal difference between KC cases and controls. The allelic and genotype frequencies of other three tested SNPs showed no significant difference between cases and controls.
   Conclusion: We confirmed previous report that SNP(s) in CAST gene conferred risk for KC susceptibility in Han Chinese population, suggesting the potential contribution of CAST gene to KC development.

AB Female germline stem cells (FGSCs) are proposed to be a key factor for ameliorating female infertility. Previously we have shown that neonatal and adult FGSCs could be isolated and purified from mouse ovarian tissues. The long noncoding (Inc) RNA growth arrest-specific 5 sequence (GASS) transcribed from mammalian genomes plays important regulatory roles in various developmental processes. However, there is no study on the relationship between GASS and FGSC development in vitro. In this study, we showed that GASS was highly expressed in the neonatal mouse ovary and was located in both FGSCs and oocytes. GASS facilitated FGSC proliferation and promoted their survival in vitro. Moreover, GASS also inhibited apoptosis of cultured FGSCs. These findings indicate that GASS is a crucial regulator of FGSC development. This might serve as a foundation for a strategy of IncRNA-directed diagnosis or treatment of female infertility.

AB Backgrounds: Clopidogrel is widely used in Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to prevent thrombotic events. However, clopidogrel response variability (CRV) may affect the patients' clinical outcomes. The current data have shown that genetic factors play an important role in CRV. The aim of this research is to investigate the association of pregnane X receptor (PXR, also called NR1I2) genetic polymorphisms with the clinical efficacy of clopidogrel in patients undergoing PCI.
   Methods: A total of 384 patients undergoing PCI were recruited and treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 12 months. The plasma concentration of clopidogrel carboxylic acid metabolites (CLPM) was measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The maximum aggregation rate (MAR) of platelet were measured by PL-11 analyzer. PXR genetic polymorphisms were determined by Sequenom MassArray system. The clinical outcomes were observed by readmission, outpatient and calling back interview within 12 months after PCI.
   Results: Among all 384 patients, a total of 153 patients were occurred with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), 29 patients were occurred with bleeding events, the other patients had a favorable prognosis. The polymprphisms of PXR rs3814057A > C [OR(95%CI): 0.71(0.527-0.957), P = 0.024], rs3814058T > C [OR (95%CI): 1.395(1.034-1.883), P = 0.029] and rs6785049 A > G [OR(95%CI): 0.724 (0.535-0.979), P = 0.036] were significantly associated with MACE. The haplotype h1 (GCC) was associated with a higher risk of MACE [OR (95%CI): 1.385 (1.028-1.866), P = 0.031]. Whereas, the haplotype h2 (AAT) was associated with a lower risk of MACE [OR (95%CI): 0.711(0.525-0.962), P = 0.027].
   Conclusions: The genotypes and haplotypes of PXR rs3814057, rs3814058 and rs6785049 have impact on the MACE in clopidogrel treated patients after PCI.

AB In Arabidopsis and certain other plant species, the type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs) of the Glade A class have been demonstrated to act as negative regulators in ABA-induced stress responses, such as stomatal closure. The present study reports the identification of a PP2C ortholog from the ancient desert shrub Ammopiptanthus mongolicus (Maxim.) Cheng f. (AmPP2C), which is functionally conserved over its counterparts reported from other plant species. AmPP2C was primarily expressed in leaves, with strong transcriptional accumulation being observed in the guard cells. The expression of AmPP2C was induced in response to PEG or ABA treatments, implying the potential involvement in ABA-induced stress responses. The GFP-tagging observation revealed that AmPP2C was predominantly localized to the nuclei and partly to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, BiFC assays demonstrated an interaction between AmPP2C and the typical protein kinase SnRK2.6 (AmOST1). Overexpression of AmPP2C in Arabidopsis significantly overcame the inhibition of seed germination by ABA. The transgenic Arabidopsis lines exhibited larger stomatal apertures and significantly reduced sensitivity to ABA-induced stomatal closure, which subsequently led to greater water loss and decreased biomass under PEG-simulated drought stress treatments. Under limited nitrogen or potassium supplements, plants overexpressing AmPP2C obtained a superior capability of nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) acquisition in the green parts. Therefore, the impairment of ABA-induced stomatal closure rendered by the function of PP2C helped to identify a potential survival strategy in plants suffering persistent drought stress via the maintenance of the necessary mineral nutrient acquisition driven by transpirational solute flow.

AB Vulvar lichen sclerosis (VLS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder. Evidence is accumulating that microRNAs (miRNAs) exert crucial roles in initiation and development of a wide range of human diseases. MiR-155-5p has been frequently reported to be implicated in the tumorigenesis and progression of multiple types of cancers, however, its biological role in VLS remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the role of miR-155-5p in VLS and clarify the potential molecular mechanisms involved. In the present study, miR-155-5p was observed to be significantly upregulated in VLS tissues. Functional studies showed that miR-155-5p facilitated cell proliferation, accelerated cell cycle progression and inhibited forkhead box O (FOXO) signaling pathway in fibroblast cells. Mechanical studies demonstrated that miR-155-5p exerted its promoting effects on fibroblast cell proliferation via targeting both forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B). Besides, Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that miR-155-5p expression was negatively correlated with the mRNA expression of FOXO3 and CDKN1B in VLS tissues. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-155-5p promotes fibroblast cell proliferation and inhibits FOXO signaling pathway by negative modulation of both FOXO3 and CDKN1B in VLS, and that miR-155-5p may be used to be a potential therapeutic target for VLS.

AB Background and aim: Recent studies have shown that genetic factors are involved in the development of kidney stone disease (KSD). A case control association analysis was performed to investigate the association between homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2; OMIM *606868) polymorphisms and KSD.
   Methods: A total of 890 KSD patients and 920 healthy subjects were analyzed. Polymorphisms were genotyped using SNPscanTM high-throughput SNP classification technology. The genotypic and allelic frequencies in KSD patients and healthy individuals were analyzed using a Chi-square test.
   Results: The genotype and allele distributions of the three polymorphisms (rs2058265, rs6464214, and rs7456421 in HIPK2) displayed strong associations with KSD in males (rs2058265: odds ratio [OR] 2.480,95% confidence interval [CI] 1.205-5.106, p = 0.014; rs6464214: OR 2.466, 95%CI 1.198-5.078, p = 0.014; rs7456421: OR 2.846, 95%CI 1.362-5.947, p = 0.005; perallele: r2058265T, OR 1.357, 95%CI 1.073-1.715, p = 0.011; rs6464214G, OR 1.340, 95%CI 1.060-1.693, p = 0.014; rs7456421C, OR 1.356, 95%CI 1.073-1.713, p = 0.011). Patients carrying the T allele of rs2058265, the G allele of rs6464214, or the C allele of rs7456421 showed higher systolic blood pressure, creatinine, and uric acid levels compared with wild-genotype individuals after adjusting for age, gender, and body mass index (p < 0.005).
   Conclusion: The association of HIPK2 gene polymorphisms with KSD was only observed in males but not in females. HIPK2 gene polymorphisms were also involved in the changes of KSD-related metabolic traits.

AB Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the major subtype of primary liver cancers. HCC is typically diagnosed late in its course. With respect to cancer, the genomic actions of vitamin D are mediated through binding to the Vitamin D Receptor (VDR), which allows it to modulate the expression of genes in a cell-and tissue-specific manner. Epigenetics is a rapidly evolving field of genetic study applicable to HCC. Changes in DNA methylation patterns are thought to be early events in hepatocarcinogenesis. Curcumin has great potential as an epigenetic agent. Accordingly, the current study has been designed to study the methylation status of VDR gene promoter for the first time in HCC aiming to find its clinical significance and potential screening role in chronic Liver Disease (CLD). Additionally, we aimed to investigate, the effect of Curcumin on HCC cell line, aiming to discover new therapeutic targets through epigenetics. This study was conducted on 45 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver tissue blocks including 15 HCC samples (group A), 15 CLD samples (group B) and 15 apparently normal tissue taken from around benign lesions (group C). Methylation Specific Restriction Digestion and qPCR were done on all samples after DNA extraction. The percentage of VDR gene promoter methylation was significantly higher in the HCC group compared to both CLD and control groups (p < 0.01). VDR promoter methylation by (MS-qPCR) was decreased and the relative expression of VDR by (qRT-PCR) was markedly increased in a dose-dependent fashion in cells grown in Curcumin-adequate medium. In conclusion, this study may open a new gate for the use of VDR promoter methylation as a potential biomarker in HCC.

AB Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is one of the most severe forms of cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD) and is also the most common. Previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) and replication studies have suggested that a polymorphism in the neuropilin 1 (NRP1) gene is significantly associated with the risk of TOF. To further confirm the association between the NRP1 polymorphism and the risk of TOF and to identify additional positive functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for TOF risk, we systematically screened for functional polymorphisms throughout the regulatory and coding regions of the NRP1 gene. A total of 11 functional SNPs in 747 Chinese Han individuals, including 314 TOF patients and 433 healthy controls, were genotyped using the MassARRAY system and GeneScan. The results revealed that the allelic and genotypic frequencies of the NRP1 polymorphism rs2228638 were strongly associated with the risk of TOF (p = 0.002 and 0.001, respectively). To increase the robustness of rs2228638 as a TOF risk SNP, we conducted a meta-analysis that combined published studies and our current case-control study. The meta-analysis showed that the T allele of the NRP1 polymorphism rs2228638 was significantly associated with an increased risk of TOF in the combined population, which included European and Chinese Han individuals [combined p < 0.00001, odds ratio (OR) = 1.53, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.35-1.73]. In addition, the association analysis suggested for the first time that there is a strong association between the allele distribution of rs10080 and susceptibility to TOF (p = 0.001). Our data provide further evidence of the association between NRP1 polymorphisms and TOF risk, and suggest that rs2228638 may be an excellent marker for TOF risk in European and Chinese Han populations.

AB Currently available vaccines from inactivated foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) only protect animals by inducing neutralizing antibodies. A vaccine that contains cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes to induce strong CTL responses might protect animals more effectively. Herein, we used swine leukocyte antigen class I (SLA I) proteins derived from six different strains of domestic pigs to screen and identify shared FMDV CTL epitopes. Four potential FMDV CTL epitopes (Q01, Q02, AS3, and QA4) were confirmed by mass spectrometry. We also determined the antigenicity of these epitopes to elicit cell-mediated immunoresponse by the ELISPOT and CTL assays. Among the four peptides, Q01 and QA4 were found to bind all six SLA-I proteins with strong affinity and elicit significant activity of CTL (P < 0.01). We conclude that Q01 and QA4 peptides are novel shared epitopes that can be recognized by all six SLA-I molecules on representative CTLs.

AB The severity of multidrug resistance to antibiotics has urged development of alternative treatment approaches, including bacteriophage therapy. Given the complexity of the bacteriophage structure, formulation and stability are primary concerns. Our present work optimized process and formulations of phage powder manufacturing and investigated the stability of lyophilized bacteriophage powders under ambient storage. The model phage M13 was formulated with trehalose, mannitol, sucrose and PEG6000 and lyophilized in different conditions. Bacteriophage viability was examined by titering and was considered as the assessment of phage stability. Less titer loss of trehalose and sucrose formulations were observed compared to mannitol and PEG groups both immediately after lyophilization and upon long term storage. When evaluating lyophilization conditions, an additional 1 log titer was preserved by reduction of product drying stress. Trehalose was stabilized in the amorphous state whereas mannitol stayed in crystalline state in lyophilized powders. Increased moisture content was demonstrated to have a positive impact on viability of phage after lyophilization and upon storage. Overall, 2% trehalose or sucrose (w/v) can sufficiently stabilize phage during lyophilization process and storage in ambient conditions. There is a positive correlation between residual water and stability of phage. These collective findings highlight the potential of long-term, ambient storage of bacteriophage towards their successful use in diverse healthcare settings.

AB Erlotinib and genistein co-loaded liposomes were prepared by the thin-film hydration method. The effect of probe sonication as a size reduction method on drug incorporation and the properties of aerosols generated using air-jet and vibrating-mesh nebulisers was studied. The use of the Next Generation Impactor (NGI) to characterise inhaler formulations is limited by the need accurately to quantify drug deposited across 8 stages and is labour intensive to use. The Fast Screening Impactor (FSI) comprising two impaction stages was compared with the NGI to evaluate its applicability as a simple screening and labour-saving tool to characterise nebulised systems. For the developed liposomal formulations, an air-jet nebuliser generated a two-fold higher fine particle fraction (FPF) than a vibrating-mesh nebuliser. The findings demonstrated that the cooled FSI (5 degrees C) operated at 15 L/min was effective in differentiating the aerosol properties of the nebulised liposome formulations investigated. Overall, the optimised co-loaded liposomes were more effectively delivered by an air-jet nebuliser, than from a vibrating-mesh nebuliser over a 10 min period as determined using the abbreviated impactor.

AB Development of an appropriate method to evaluate drug disposition or targeting ability in hair follicles (HFs) is urgently needed in order to develop useful pharmaceutical products with pharmacological effects in HFs. In the present study, a cyanoacrylate biopsy (CB) method was used to measure drug disposition in HFs using a model hydrophilic drug, caffeine (CAF), and a lipophilic drug, 4-butylresorcinol (BR), in excised porcine skin. As a result, the height of HF replicas and the recovery ratio decreased with an increase in the application times of the CB method. HF replicas with a length of approximately 175 mu m were obtained using a single application of the CB method. Drug distribution in the HF was detected even 5 min after topical application regardless of the lipophilicity of the drugs, although no drug disposition was observed in the deeper layers of the stratum corneum at the same time (5 min). Furthermore, significantly higher amounts of BR were observed in the stratum corneum and HF, compared with those of CAF. These results suggested that the CB method could be useful to evaluate the safety and efficacy as well as the disposition of topically applied chemicals, especially for HF-targeting drugs.

AB Raloxifene HCl belongs to a class of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) which is used for the management of breast cancer. The major problem reported with raloxifene is its poor bioavailability which is only up to 2%. The main objective of the present work was to formulate raloxifene loaded ethosomal preparation for transdermal application and compare it with an oral formulation of the drug. Five ethosomal formulations with different concentrations of ethanol and a conventional liposomes formulation were prepared by rotary evaporation method. The prepared systems were characterised by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), force emission electron microscopy (FESEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and P-31 NMR study. All these advanced characterization study established that the ethosome formulation was well defined by its size, shape and its bilayer formation. Transdermal flux of the optimized ethosome formulation was 22.14 +/- 0.83 mu g/ml/cm(2) which was 21 times higher when compared to the conventional liposomes. Confocal microscopy study revealed an enhanced permeation of coumarin-6 dye loaded ethosomes to much deeper layers of skin when compared with conventional liposomes. The gel was found to be pseudoplastic with elastic behaviour. In-vivo studies on rats showed a higher bioavailability of RXL (157% times) for ethosomal formulation when compared with the oral formulation. In conclusion, RXL loaded ethosomal formulation via transdermal route showed superior drug delivery properties as compared to oral formulation.

AB Capping and lamination are common industrial problems during the manufacturing of pharmaceutical tablets. Even if they are commonly treated together, these phenomena correspond to different failure patterns of the tablet and, as a consequence, to different mechanisms of cracking. In this work, a specific case of lamination of biconvex tablets was studied. It corresponds to a breakage into two parts of the tablets along a failure plan normal to the compression direction and located approximately at the center of the tablet band.
   Simulation with finite element method made it possible to propose that this kind of failure is promoted by tensile stresses localized at the center of the tablet that are induced by the residual die wall pressure and the tablet shape. Moreover, these stresses are favored by a small band thickness. Experimental results confirmed these hypotheses and also showed that this kind of lamination was favored by a high compaction pressure.
   As the crack is formed at the center of the tablet, it may not propagate until the tablet band. Failure may thus remain undetected by external visual examination. X-ray tomography made it possible to observe central cracks inside the tablet without tablet breakage. The possibility to have such cracks inside the tablet must be considered during tablet development as, even if not detected just after compression, they could lead to tablet failure during post compaction events.

AB The present study was aimed to develop a medium-throughput screening technique for investigation of cyclodextrin (CD)-active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) complexes. Dual-phase potentiometric lipophilicity measurement, as gold standard technique, was combined with the partition coefficient method (plotting the reciprocal of partition coefficients of APIs as a function of CD concentration). A general equation was derived for determination of stability constants of 1:1 CD-API complexes (K-1:1,K-CD) based on solely the changes of partition coefficients (logP(o/w)(N)-logP(app)(N)), without measurement of the actual API concentrations. Experimentally determined logP value (-1.64) of 6-deoxy-6[(5/6)-fluoresceinylthioureido]-HPBCD (FITC-NH-HPBCD) was used to estimate the logP value (approximate to -2.5 to -3) of (2-hydroxypropyl)-B-cyclodextrin (HPBCD). The results suggested that the amount of HPBCD can be considered to be inconsequential in the octanol phase. The decrease of octanol volume due to the octanol-CD complexation was considered, thus a corrected octanol-water phase ratio was also introduced. The K-1:1,K-CD values obtained by this developed method showed a good accordance with the results from other orthogonal methods.

AB The purpose of this study was to use statistical design of experiments to develop a stable aqueous enteric coating formulation containing stabilizing excipients, such as polyethylene glycol that can minimize hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate aggregation and minimize spray-nozzle clogging at elevated processing temperatures. The mechanisms of stabilization (i.e. charge stabilization and molecular interactions) were studied by performing zeta potential and FTIR studies. Electrostatic stabilization by sodium lauryl sulfate and hydrogen bonding by polyethylene glycol provided dispersion stability and yielded a stable aqueous coating formulation that prevented spray-nozzle clogging. An enteric coated tablet with better gastric resistance was obtained by incorporating fumed silica (Aerosil (R) R972) as the anti-tacking agent instead of talc. Dissolution testing on the riboflavin enteric coated tablets showed a good enteric release profile without releasing riboflavin in 0.1 N HCl, and completely disintegrating within 10 min in phosphate buffer (pH 6.8).

AB The aim of this study was to develop a novel buccal bi-layered chronopatch capable of eliciting pulsatile release pattern of drugs treating diseases with circadian rhythm related manifestation. Zaleplon (ZLP) was used as a model drug intended to induce sleep and to treat middle of night insomnia. The chronopatch was prepared adopting double casting technique. The first layer was composed of a controlled release patch containing ZLP-Precirol melt granules intended to release ZLP in a sustained manner to maintain sleep and to prevent early morning awakening. The second layer was composed of a fast release lyophilized buccal disc containing ZLP loaded SNEDDS (Z-SNEDDS) intended for rapid sleep induction. Pharmacokinetic parameters of ZLP from the chronopatch were compared to those of the immediate release capsule, Siesta (R), as reference in Mongrel dogs using a randomized crossover design. The appearance of two peaks having two C-max and T-max proved the pulsatile release pattern. The increase in relative bioavailability of ZLP from the chronopatch was 2.63 folds. The results revealed the ability of the developed ZLP loaded bi-layered chronopatch to be a candidate for overcoming early morning awakening without middle of night dose administration.

AB A novel pH-responsive molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) based on Itaconic acid: Ethylene glycol dimethacrylate was developed as a potential body-friendly oral drug delivery system for metronidazole (MZ), a pH-independent drug. MIP performance was evaluated in a simulated oral administration situation, at pHs 2.2 and 7.4. Itaconic acid-based copolymers were synthesized using two different molar ratios of template: monomer:crosslinker (T:M:C), 1:5:25 and 1:5:50, in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) in high yields. Further, impregnation of MZ was performed in scCO(2) environment. Morphological and chemical properties of the copolymers produced were assessed by SEM, Morphologi G3 and FTIR analyses. Non-molecularly imprinted polymer (NIP) matrices presented swelling over time in opposition to the molecularly imprinted ones. In the scCO(2)-impregnation process, MIPs showed a significant molecular recognition towards MZ, presenting higher drug uptake ability with MZ loading of 18-61 wt% in MIPs, compared to 7-20 wt% in NIPs. In vitro drug release experiments presented different release profiles at the different pHs, where MZ-MIPs could release higher amounts of MZ at the lowest pH than at pH 7.4.

AB Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) has been widely used in amorphous solid dispersions and as an enteric coating polymer. Under aqueous coating conditions and at elevated coating temperatures, HPMCAS particles tend to aggregate and clog the spray-nozzle, hence interrupting the coating process. This research focused on how plasticizers and surfactants, excipients used for aqueous coating, affect the properties and stability of HPMCAS. This information would be useful in identifying suitable excipients for developing a stable HPMCAS aqueous enteric coating formulation. Triethyl citrate was found to be the most compatible plasticizer with HPMCAS, and displayed suitable thermal and mechanical properties. PEG 4000, the co-plasticizer, provided dispersion stability by yielding a dispersible sediment without aggregation at the elevated processing temperatures. Zeta potential measurements indicated sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) could be used as a potential stabilizing agent at concentrations above its critical micelle concentration (CMC). This study facilitated the understanding of the HPMCAS aggregation mechanism, in addition to identifying suitable stabilizing agents. These stabilizing excipients could potentially be used to develop a stable aqueous coating formulation that does not exhibit polymer aggregation and nozzle clogging during the coating process.

AB Currently, the compressed tablet and its oral administration is the most popular drug delivery modality in medicine. The accurate porosity and tensile strength characterization of a tablet design is vital for predicting its performance such as disintegration, dissolution, and drug-release efficiency upon administration as well as ensuring its mechanical integrity. In current work, a non-destructive contact ultrasonic approach and an associated testing procedure are presented and employed to quantify and relate the acoustically extracted mechanical properties of pharmaceutical compacts to direct porosity and tensile strength measurements. Based on a comprehensive set of experimental data, it is demonstrated how strongly the acoustic wave propagation is modulated and correlated to the tablet porosity and tensile strength of a compact made using spray-dried lactose and microcrystalline cellulose with varying mixture ratios. The effect of mixing ratio on the porosity and tensile strength on the resulting compacts is quantified and, with the acoustic experimental data, mixing ratio is related to the compact ultrasonic characteristics. The ultrasonic techniques provide a rapid, non-destructive means for evaluating compacts in formulation development and manufacturing. The presented approach and data could find critical applications in continuous tablet manufacturing, its real-time quality monitoring, as well as minimizing batch-to-batch quality variations.
