AB Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the first cause of death in the World. Mediator (MED) is an evolutionarily conserved protein complex, which mediates distinct protein-protein interactions. Pathogenic events in MED subunit have been associated with human diseases. Novel increasing evidence showed that missense mutations in MED13L gene are associated with transposition of great arteries while MED12, MED13, MED15, and MED30, have been correlated with heart development. Moreover, MED23 and MED25 have been associated with heart malformations in humans. Relevantly, MED1, MED13, MED14, MED15, MED23, MED25, and CDK8, were found modify glucose and/or lipid metabolism. Indeed, MED1, MED15, MED25, and CDK8 interact in the PPAR-and SREBP-mediated signaling pathways. MED1, MED14 and MED23 are involved in adipocyte differentiation, whereas MED23 mediates smooth muscle cell differentiation. MED12, MED19, MED23, and MED30 regulate endothelial differentiation by alternative splicing mechanism. Thus, MEDs have a central role in early pathogenic events involved in CVDs representing novel targets for clinical prevention and therapeutic approaches.

AB THOR, a highly conserved lncRNA, is potentially involved in various cancer development. However, its involvement in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) remains unclear. The present study aims to explore the biological function and molecular mechanism of THOR in TSCC progression. The expressions of THOR and IGF2BP1 in TSCC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tongue tissues (ANT) were examined through qRT-PCR. THOR levels were manipulated in TSCC cells to explore its function in cancer progression in vitro and in vivo, which were subsequently evaluated by CCK8, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, xenograft tumor assays. In situ hybridization, RIP and Western blot assay were performed to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. We discovered that THOR and IGF2BP1 were dramatically upregulated in TSCC tissues. The expression of THOR is positively correlated with IGF2BP1 mRNA level. THOR mediated IGF2 expression via interacting with IGF2BP1, and affected the downstream MEK-ERK signaling pathway to regulate TSCC cells proliferation. THOR/IGF2BP1/IGF2-MEK-ERK axis regulated the proliferation of TSCC cells, implying that THOR would be a promising therapeutic target for TSCC patients.

AB Homocysteine (Hcy) is a key metabolite generated during methionine metabolism. The elevated levels of Hcy in the blood are reffered to as hyperhomocystenimeia (HHcy). The HHcy is caused by impaired metabolism/deficiency of either folate or B12 or defects in Hcy metabolism. Accumulating evidence suggests that HHcy is associated with cardiovascular and brain diseases including atherosclerosis, endothelial injury, and stroke etc. Vitamin B12 (cobalamin; B12) is a water-soluble vitamin essential for two metabolic reactions. It acts as a co-factor for methionine synthase and L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Besides, it is also vital for DNA synthesis and maturation of RBC. Deficiency of B12 is associated with haematological and neurological disorders. Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy)-induced toxicity is thought to be mediated by the accumulation of Hcy and its metabolites, homocysteinylated proteins. Cellular protein quality control (PQC) is essential for the maintenance of proteome integrity, and cell viability and its failure contributes to the development of multiple diseases. Chaperones, unfolded protein response (UPR), ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), and autophagy are analogous strategies of PQC that maintain cellular proteome integrity. Recently, multiple studies reported that HHcy responsible for perturbation of PQC by reducing chaperone levels, activating UPR, and impairing autophagy. Besides, HHcy also induce cytotoxicity, inflammation, protein aggregation and apoptosis. It has been shown that some of the factors including altered SIRT1-HSF1 axis and irreversible homocysteinylation of proteins are responsible for folate and/or B12 deficiency or HHcy-induced impairment of PQC. Therefore, this review highlights the current understanding of HHcy in the context of cellular PQC and their pathophysiological and clinical consequences, epigenomic changes, therapeutic implications of B12, and chemical chaperones based on cell culture and experimental animal models.

AB Matrix metalloproteinases are a class of enzymes, which degrade extracellular matrix components such as collagens, elastin, laminin or fibronectin. So far, four matrix metalloproteinases have been shown to degrade elastin and its precursor tropoelastin, namely matrix metalloproteinase-2, -7, -9 and -12. This study focuses on investigating the elastinolytic capability of membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase, also known as matrix metalloproteinase-14. We digested recombinant human tropoelastin and human skin elastin with matrix metalloproteinase-14 and analyzed the peptide mixtures using complementary mass spectrometric techniques and bioinformatics tools. The results and additional molecular docking studies show that matrix metalloproteinase-14 cleaves tropoelastin as well as elastin. While tropoelastin was well degraded, fewer cleavages occurred in the highly cross-linked mature elastin. The study also provides insights into the cleavage preferences of the enzyme. Similar to cleavage preferences of matrix metalloproteinases-2, -7, -9 and -12, matrix metalloproteinase-14 prefers small and medium-sized hydrophobic residues including Gly, Ala, Leu and Val at cleavage site P1'. Pro, Gly and Ala were preferably found at P1-P4 and P20-P40 in both tropoelastin and elastin. Cleavage of mature skin elastin by matrix metalloproteinase-14 released a variety of bioactive elastin peptides, which indicates that the enzyme may play a role in the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases that go along with elastin breakdown.

Studies of grape PPO to date have mostly relied on enzymes extracted and purified from plants. In this work, we describe the production of the mature form of Shine Muscat grape PPO by using an Escherichia coli expression system. We have optimised the purification procedure to obtain pure and active recombinant enzymes and characterised the catalytic efficiency of the recombinant grape PPO by using ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) spectrophotometry. Our work provides a simple protocol of obtaining pure and active recombinant grape PPO that will enable further studies about the catalytic mechanism and inhibition of this enzyme.

AB Periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) are a promising tool for regenerative medicine in clinical periodontal ligament repair. However, clinical maintenance of high quality and large quantity of PDLSCs faces multiple obstacles. One of them is how PDLSCs respond to environmental stimuli such as reactive oxygen species. We aim to elucidate how PDLSCs react to oxidative stress and the underlying mechanisms. We utilized hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress to mimic ROS increase in rat PDLSCs. Our data indicated a rapid downregulation of a long non-coding RNA, lncRNA JHDM1D antisense 1 (JHDM1DAS1), when PDLSCs were treated with hydrogen peroxide, which was negatively associated with PDLSC apoptosis. Moreover, our data showed that JHDM1D-AS1 regulated PDLSC apoptosis via inhibition of DNAJC10, a heat shock protein 40 family member. Moreover, overexpressed DNAJC10 inhibited Bcl-2 protein level and eIF2 alpha phosphorylation level, which, in turn, contributed to PDLSC apoptosis. Our results revealed a protective role of JHDM1D-AS1 in ROS-induced apoptosis, and validated that JHDM1DAS1/ DNAJC10/phosphorylated-eIF2 alpha/Bcl-2 pathway works as an anti-apoptotic signaling axis in PDLSCs. These findings will facilitate the in vitro culturing of PDLSCs for clinical usage and promote stem cell-based therapy for periodontal tissue regeneration.

AB Serum-and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1), a protein kinase, shares significant structural similarity with other members of the AGC protein kinase family. It has been reported that the inactive SGK1 structure lacks alpha C helix and this unique feature makes it distinct from other protein kinases. Activation of SGK1 by PDK1 requires phosphorylation at Thr256, but the structural insights of the activation remain unclear. The co-crystal structures of small molecule inhibitors, Magnesium (Mg+2) and ATP bound to the inactive SGK1 are reported however the important regulatory domains such as aC helix are missing in these crystal structures. We modelled the missing alpha C domain and employed computational molecular dynamics simulations to study the conformational changes in the WT and phosphorylated human SGK1 to systematically investigate how the individual domain motions are modulated by the binding of substrate and Mg+2. The MD results corroborate with the experiential findings and has shown that the inactive SGK1 lacks alpha C helix content. Surprisingly, we find that the active SGK1 structure closely resembles with other protein kinases and adopt the alpha C helix content up on SGK1 phosphorylation. However, the residues participating in alpha C helix formation are fewer than reported in protein kinase A structure, a close relative of SGK1. The computational binding analysis reveals that most of the SGK1 selective inhibitors have less binding affinity for active SGK1 than some FDA-approved kinase inhibitors such as Afatinib, Tofacitinib, Dabrafenib, and Palbociclib. Only EMD638683 was seen as a strong candidate for selective SGK1 inhibition. To our knowledge, this is the first dynamic study of SGK1 that provides new structural insights around the active site that would surely help the experimental biologists for the design of suitable selective ligands able to inhibit or activate SGK1 function.

AB More than half of the world's population is infected with persistent bacterial infections, consequently, persisters are gradually becoming a major public health concern. During the persistent phase, bacterial pathogens deploy many regulatory strategies to compensate unfavorable host environmental conditions. The stringent response is one of such gene regulatory mechanisms which is stimulated by nutrient starvation. It is regulated by the synthesis of highly phosphorylated signaling nucleotides, (p) ppGpp or alarmone. (p) ppGpp is synthesized by ppGpp synthetases, and these proteins are classified as RelA/SpoT homolog (RSH) proteins. Subsequently, (p) ppGpp modulate several molecular and biochemical processes ranging from transcription to metabolism. Imperativeness of (p) ppGpp synthetases has been investigated by numerous approaches including microbiology and animal studies, thereby establishing that Rel enzyme deleted strains of pathogenic bacteria were unable to transform in persister form. In this review, we summarize recent findings to corroborate the rationality to consider (p) ppGpp synthetase as a potential target in discovering a novel class of antimicrobial agents to combat persistent infections. Moreover, inhibition studies on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (p) ppGpp synthetase shows that these inhibitors prevent dormant state transition and biofilm formation. Also, we have highlighted the structural biology of (p) ppGpp synthetases, which may provide significant information that could be used in structure-based inhibitor design.

AB At least, more than half of our understanding of extracellular vesicles owes to the studies conducted over the past few years. When it became clear that the exosomes have various potentials in medicine, extensive research has focused on these potentials in a variety of areas including cancer, drug delivery and regenerative medicine. The growing understanding of molecular structure and functions of exosomes causes the vision to become brighter in the exosomes complexity, and our attitude toward these vesicles has undergone changes accordingly. Proteomic and transcriptomic studies on exosomes have highlighted their molecular diversity. In this review, we explicitly examine the exosomes composition, molecular structure and their therapeutic potentials in some diseases. Due to the very heterogeneous nature of exosomes, the process of their use as a therapeutic agent in the clinic has been challenged. We are still at the beginning of recognizing the molecular composition of exosomes and mechanisms that affect their physiology and biology. The growing trend of engineering of exosomes has shown a promising future to further utilize them in a different field. Molecular profiling of exosomes and their content for their related potentials in regenerative medicine should be done exactly for further defining a minimum content for specific therapeutic potentials.

AB The cardioprotection of catalpol and its mechanism in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) remains unclear. Here, mouse cardiomyocytes were treated with high glucose (HG) to establish a model of cellular injury induced by HG. In vitro experiments were carried out and confirmed that Catalpol attenuated HG-induced long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (Neat1) expression in mouse cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, luciferase reporter analysis indicated that Neat1 could decrease the transcription of miR-140-5p to positively regulate histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) expression. Notably, overexpression of miR-140-5p or silencing of HDAC4 rescued Neat1-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. DCM was induced in male C57BL/6 mice by intraperitoneal injection with streptozotocin (STZ) combined with a high-fat/high-sugar diet. Further in vivo experiments identified that Catalpol alleviated myocardial damage by regulating Neat1/miR-140-5p/HDAC4 axis in DCM mice. Thus, our results demonstrated that Catalpol could exert cardioprotective effect against DCM via Neat1/ miR-140-5p/HDAC4 pathway. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB High glucose (HG)-induced podocyte injury contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy, a severe complication of diabetes. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) has emerged as a critical regulator for cell injury. However, whether BRD4 participates in HG-induced podocyte injury remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential role of BRD4 in regulating HG-induced podocyte injury and its underlying molecular mechanism. HG exposure significantly upregulated BRD4 in podocytes. BRD4 inhibition by small interfering RNA or its chemical inhibitor (JQ1) markedly repressed HG-induced apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. By contrast, BRD4 overexpression exacerbated HG-induced podocyte injury. Moreover, BRD4 inhibition potentiated nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) signaling associated with suppression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein (Keap1). BRD4 inhibition promoted Nrf2 nuclear translocation and upregulated the transcriptional activity of Nrf2/antioxidant response element (ARE). However, Nrf2 silencing partially reversed BRD4-inhibition-mediated protection against HG-induced podocyte injury. Overall, these results suggest that BRD4 inhibition confers cytoprotection against HG injury in podocytes through potentiation of Nrf2/ARE antioxidant signaling. This finding implicates BRD4/Nrf2/ARE signaling in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB Oridonin is a diterpenoid isolated from the Rabdosia rubescens and has multiple biological effects, such as anti-inflammation and anti-tumor activities. In present study, we revealed that the sensitizing effect of oridonin on tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis in several cancer cells, but not in normal cells. Oridonin enhanced death-signaling inducing complexes (DISC) formation and DR5 glycosylation without affecting expression of downstream intracellular apoptosis-related proteins. Oridonin upregulated peptidyl O-glycosyltransferase GALNT14 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Knockdown of GALNT14 by siRNA and Endo H treatment reduced oridonin-induced DR5 glycosylation. Furthermore, treatment with inhibitor of glycosylation (benzyl-alpha-GalNAc) blocked oridonin plus TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Collectively, our results suggest that oridonin-induced DR5 glycosylation contributes to TRAIL-induced apoptotic cell death in cancer cells.

AB Background: In this study, we aimed to investigate the biological functions of Transmembrane Channel-Like 5 (TMC5) by bioinformatics and molecular biology methods in prostate cancer (PCa).
   Methods: We assessed the mRNA expression level of TMC5 in PCa with public database the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Oncomine. The biological functions were demonstrated by bioinformatics methods and siRNA mediated knockdown experiments. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemical (IHC) experiments and microarray analysis were performed to confirm the results.
   Results: TMC5 expression level was significantly up-regulated in 4 independent PCa cohorts compared to normal group. Moreover, TMC5 has higher diagnostic efficiency than PSA-KLK3 (AUC (Area Under Curve) = 0.772, P < 0.001). The high expression of TMC5 was associated with clinical Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, androgen receptor (AR) activity score and the genes which were known frequently mutated in PCa progression (P < 0.05). Functionally, Gene Otology (GO) analysis suggested that TMC5 was related to cell development; TMC5 knockdown significantly inhibited PCa cells proliferation by arresting cell cycle at G1 phase. Drug sensitivity experiments showed TMC5 knockdown significantly enhanced cells sensitivity to 5-Fluorouracil. Microarray analysis showed TMC5 knockdown significantly inhibited cell cycle and tumor progression.
   Conclusion: Our findings revealed that TMC5 promoted PCa cell proliferation through cell cycle regulation and could be a powerful and hopeful target for PCa treatment. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Since 2012, the interest for TMEM165 increased due to its implication in a rare genetic human disease named TMEM165-CDG (Congenital Disorder(s) of Glycosylation). TMEM165 is a Golgi localized protein, highly conserved through evolution and belonging to the uncharacterized protein family 0016 (UPF0016). Although the precise function of TMEM165 in glycosylation is still controversial, our results highly suggest that TMEM165 would act as a Golgi Ca2+/Mn2+ transporter regulating both Ca2+ and Mn2+ Golgi homeostasis, the latter is required as a major cofactor of many Golgi glycosylation enzymes. Strikingly, we recently demonstrated that besides its role in regulating Golgi Mn2+ homeostasis and consequently Golgi glycosylation, TMEM165 is sensitive to high manganese exposure. Members of the UPF0016 family contain two particularly highly conserved consensus motifs E-phi-G-D-[KR]-[TS] predicted to be involved in the ion transport function of UPF0016 members. We investigate the contribution of these two specific motifs in the function of TMEM165 in Golgi glycosylation and in its Mn2+ sensitivity.
   Our results show the crucial importance of these two conserved motifs and underline the contribution of some specific amino acids in both Golgi glycosylation and Mn2+ sensitivity. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Swainsonine is a major toxic ingredients of locoweed plants, ingestion of these plants may cause locoism in livestock characterized by extensive cellular vacuolar degeneration of multiple tissues. However, so far, the mechanisms responsible for vacuolar degeneration induced by SW are not known. In this study, we investigated the role of autophagy in SW-induced TCMK-1 cells using Western blotting, transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescent microscopy and qRT-PCR. The results showed that SW treatment increased the levels of LC3-II. The co-localization of LC3-II and lysosomal protein LAMP-2 results suggested that SW treatment does not interfere with fusion between autophagosome and lysosome. TEM results indicated that SW induced aggregation of the lysosome around the autophagosome. In addition, SW treatment suppressed p-PI3K, p-Akt, p-mTOR, p-p70S6K and p-4EBP1 level. In conclusion, SW induced autophagy via pI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and revealed the role of autophagy in causing the SW toxicity characterized by the vacuolar degeneration.

AB MicroRNA-25-5p (miR-25-5p) may be involved in the pathogenesis and processes of vascular diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of miR-25-5p in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-treated human brain microvessel endothelial cells (HBMECs) and the underlying mechanisms. RT-qPCR and/or Western blot were used to detect the expression levels of miR-25-5p and neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1). The effect of miR-25-5p overexpression and NEGR1 silencing on cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production of HBMECs were measured by using CCK-8 assay, transwell assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The expression levels of apoptosis-related protein (cleaved caspase-3 and pro-caspase-3) were detected using Western blot, and the nitric oxide (NO) production was measured by a nitric oxide assay kit. The expression level of miR-25-5p was decreased in HBMECs treated with ox-LDL. Compared with the control group, miR-25-5p overexpression significantly promoted the proliferation and migration of HBMECs treated with ox-LDL (p < 0.01). Overexpression of miR-25-5p significantly suppressed cell apoptosis, ROS production and NO reduction of ox-LDL-induced HBMECs (p < 0.01). In addition, the target gene of miR-25-5p was predicted to be NEGR1 through Targetscan online analysis. The effect of NEGR1 silencing on cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, ROS and NO production of ox-LDL-induced HBMECs was similar to that of miR-25-5p overexpression. Furthermore, miR-25-5p overexpression and NEGR1 silencing significantly downregulated the protein expression levels of JAK2 and STAT3. Thus, miR-25-5p neutralizes the effects of ox-LDL on multiple functions of HBMECs through suppressing the expression of NEGR1 via regulating the JAK/STA signaling pathway.

AB Flexibility is an intrinsic essential feature of protein structures, directly linked to their functions. To this day, most of the prediction methods use the crystallographic data (namely B-factors) as the only indicator of protein's inner flexibility and predicts them as rigid or flexible.
   PredyFlexy stands differently from other approaches as it relies on the definition of protein flexibility (i) not only taken from crystallographic data, but also (ii) from Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSFs) observed in Molecular Dynamics simulations. It also uses a specific representation of protein structures, named Long Structural Prototypes (LSPs). From Position-Specific Scoring Matrix, the 120 LSPs are predicted with a good accuracy and directly used to predict (i) the protein flexibility in three categories (flexible, intermediate and rigid), (ii) the normalized B-factors, (iii) the normalized RMSFs, and (iv) a confidence index. Prediction accuracy among these three classes is equivalent to the best two class prediction methods, while the normalized B-factors and normalized RMSFs have a good correlation with experimental and in silico values. Thus, PredyFlexy is a unique approach, which is of major utility for the scientific community. It support parallelization features and can be run on a local cluster using multiple cores.

AB Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) protein tyrosine phosphatase (PtpA) has so far been known to control intracellular survival of mycobacteria; whereas the ATP synthase which is essential for mycobacterial growth has recently been contemplated in developing a breakthrough anti-TB drug, diarylquinoline. Since both of these enzymes have been established as validated drug targets; we report a robust and functional relationship between these two enzymes through a series of experiments using Mtb H37Ra. In the present study we report that the mycobacterial ATP synthase alpha subunit is regulated by PtpA. We generated gene knock-out for the enzyme PtpA and subjected to determine the mycobacterial replication and the proteome profile of wild type, mutant (DptpA) and complemented (DptpA:ptpA) strains of Mtb H37Ra. A substantial amount of decrease in the protein level of ATP synthase alpha subunit (AtpA) in case of mutant H37Ra was observed, while the levels of the enzyme were either increased or remained unchanged, in wild type and in the complemented strains.

AB Deoxyribozymes are synthetic and single stranded DNAs that are capable of catalysis of a variety of reactions, including cleavage of DNA substrates. Deoxyribozymes are usually characterized by analytical single-turnover kinetic assays, however, for many applications e.g. characterization of the reaction products, semi-preparative and preparative reactions are required. At such scales, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis and conditions that supports high amount of products in an appropriate time-scale are vaguely guessed by researchers. In this report, catalytic activity of an oxidizing DNA-cleaving deoxyribozyme, F-8(X), was comprehensively inspected in semi-preparative (10 mu M substrate) scale. A 60 nucleotides long synthetic DNA sequence was selected as the target DNA for this study. The DNA sequence was originated from a single stranded DNA virus. Investigations revealed high yield in the presence of optimal concentration of oxidizing agents. The optimal conditions have been applied for scale-up of the reaction to preparative (40 mu M substrate) and multi-turnover reactions to achieve highest amount of product in a cost-, time- and labor-effective manner. Such a comprehensive analysis of a deoxyribozyme's activity in semi-preparative scale provides a platform for expanded applications of DNA catalysts as a tool in chemical biology.

AB The interactions of 6-8 ring hairpin polyamides (PAs) with the minor groove of DNA have been investigated extensively. More recent studies of large antiviral PAs (14-20 rings) active against small DNA tumor viruses lead to questions regarding the extent to which the DNA binding behaviors of the well studied, smaller PAs can be reliably extrapolated to the larger ones. Described here is the first reported study of hairpin PA-DNA binding thermodynamics as a function of PA size (6-20 rings). All PAs exhibit binding affinity in the low nM to upper pM range, which indicates that affinity is not a discriminator of antiviral activity. Unlike the smaller PAs, a 20-ring PA does not appreciably dissociate from DNA in competition experiments, which indicates very long residence time that is consistent with antiviral activity. While the DNA binding thermodynamics for the smaller antivirally inactive 6- and 8-ring PAs is clearly enthalpically driven, the larger antiviral PAs (14- and 20-rings) exhibit strongly entropically-driven DNA binding. These distinct energetic signatures indicate that different types of interactions drive these associations. In DNA binding site stoichiometry experiments conducted at both nM and mu M concentrations, all PAs except the 6- ring PA bind an isolated site with site stoichiometry of at least two PAs per recognition sequence. Electrostatic contributions to DNA binding affinity are small for all PAs and not correlated with PA size but weakly correlated with the number of imidazole residues. Altogether, these results indicate that DNA binding behaviors of smaller hairpin PAs do not necessarily reflect those of larger PAs. These are vital considerations in the development of hairpin PAs for biological use. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM). All rights reserved.

AB Multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2/ABCC2), a hepatocyte canalicular transporter involved in bile secretion, is downregulated in cholestasis triggered by lipopolysaccharide. The human aquaporin-1 (hAQP1) adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to liver improves cholestasis by incompletely defined mechanisms. Here we found that hAQP1 did not affect MRP2/ABCC2 expression, but significantly increased its transport activity assessed in situ with endogenous and exogenous substrates, likely by a hAQP1-induced increase in canalicular membrane cholesterol amount. Our results suggest that hAQP1-induced MRP2/ABCC2 activation contributes to the cholestasis improvement. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

TI The case for class II bacteriocins: A biophysical approach using
   "suicide probes" in receptor-free hosts to study their mechanism of

AB Class II bacteriocins are unmodified membrane-active peptides that act over a narrow spectrum of target bacteria. They bind a specific receptor protein on the membrane to form a pore, leading to membrane permeabilization and cell death. However, little is known about the molecular events triggering the pore formation after the bacteriocin recognizes the receptor. It is not clear yet if the pore is the same receptor forced into an open conformation or if the pore results from the bacteriocin insertion and oligomeric assembly in the lipid bilayer. In order to reveal which model is more suitable to explain the toxicity mechanism, in this work we use chimeric peptides, resulting from the fusion of the bitopic membrane protein EtpM with different class II bacteriocins: enterocin CRL35, pediocin PA-1 and microcin V. E. coli strains lacking the specific receptors for these bacteriocins were chosen as expression hosts. As these constructs display a lethal effect when they are heterologously expressed, they are called "suicide probes". The results suggest that, indeed, the specific receptor would act as a docking molecule more than as a structural piece of the pore, as long as the bacteriocin is somehow anchored to the membrane. These set of chimeric peptides also represent an in vivo system that allows to study the interaction of the bacteriocins with real bacterial membranes, instead of model membranes. Hence, the effects of these suicide probes in membrane fluidity and transmembrane potential were also assessed, using fluorescence spectroscopy. The data show that the different suicide probes are able to increase phospholipid order and depolarize the membranes of receptor-free bacterial cells. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Chemical chaperones are a class of small molecules which enhance folding and prevent aggregation of proteins. Investigation of their effects on the processes of protein aggregation is of importance for further understanding of implication of protein aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases, as well as for solving biotechnological tasks. The effects of chemical chaperones trehalose and 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) on the kinetics of aggregation of UV-irradiated muscle glycogen phosphorylase b (UV-Phb) at 37 degrees C have been studied. The process of thermal aggregation of UV-Phb includes a slow stage of structural reorganization of the UV-Phb molecule, nucleation stage and fast attachment of structurally reorganized UV-Phb molecules to nuclei formed during the nucleation stage. It was shown that both trehalose and HP-beta-CD increased the duration of the nucleation phase and slowed down the rate of structural reorganization of the UV-Phb molecule. This conclusion has been confirmed by the circular dichroism data. In the absence of chaperones, 82% UV-Phb aggregates, whereas in the presence of HP-beta-CD or trehalose the portion of aggregated protein decreases to 70 and 66%, respectively. The data on analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrated that in the presence of these additives the size of protein aggregates decreased. Analysis of the combined effect of trehalose and HP-beta-CD on UV-Phb aggregation showed that protein aggregation was independently affected by trehalose and HP-beta-CD.

AB Ongoing efforts are oriented towards the development of novel therapeutic agents to repress lung hyperpermeability responses due to inflammation. The endothelial barrier dysfunction triggered by such events, may eventually lead to severe cardiovascular complications, such as the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Hsp90 inhibitors are anticancer compounds, associated with strong anti-inflammatory responses in the endothelium. Our latest observations in experimental models of Acute Lung Injury suggest that P53 orchestrates, at least in part, such activities. Remarkably, both Hsp90 inhibition and P53 induction are associated with the activation of the Unfolded Protein Response element. The purpose of the current manuscript, is to introduce the hypotheses that UPR induction protects the vasculature against inflammation.

ID CASSETTE TRANSPORTER A1; FATTY LIVER-DISEASE; EXPRESSION; INCREASES;

AB Dysfunction in lipid metabolism may result in a decrease in hepatic autophagy, which contributes to the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 transports free cholesterol and phospholipids to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) to form nascent high-density lipoprotein particles. Results from previous studies showed that the overexpression of apoA-I significantly reduced levels of hepatic lipids and endoplasmic reticulum stress by modifying lipid transport. Here, we investigated the effects of apoA-I overexpression on hepatic autophagy in cultured hepatocytes and mice. The overexpression of apoA-I in HepG2 cells resulted in an increase in the levels of autophagy as well as the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPK alpha) and ULK1 and a decrease in the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). An AMPK inhibitor and siRNA eliminated this apoA-I effect. Consistently, apoA-I transgenic mice showed increased autophagy and AMPK alpha phosphorylation. These results suggest that apoA-I overexpression alleviates steatohepatitis by increasing hepatic autophagy through the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 pathway.

AB Low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) promotes bone fracture healing in clinical therapy. Transcription factor Forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) is crucial for bone differentiation. But whether FOXO1 is involved in LIPUS-promoted bone differentiation is largely unknown. In the current study, treatment of human primary periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) with LIPUS promoted total and nucleus FOXO1 protein accumulation. LIPUS-induced activation of FOXO1 further lead to higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) expression and matrix mineralization. LIPUS inhibited miR-182 expression, which functioned as a repressor of FOXO1 through post-transcriptional regulation. Overexpression of miR-182 reversed the LIPUS-enhanced FOXO1 expression and osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, LIPUS enhanced Akt phosphorylation, which functioned in preventing active FOXO1 excessive accumulation via inducing the cytoplasm translocation of nucleus FOXO1. In conclusion, our study revealed that FOXO1, which was a target gene of miR-182, played an essential role in LIPUS-promoted osteogenic differentiation. This new molecular insight throws light upon the application of LIPUS therapy on periodontal bone defect. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical process in the development of many tissues and organs in multicellular organisms that its important role in the pathogenesis of metastasis and tumor cell migration has been firmly established. Decreased adhesive capacity, cytoskeletal reorganization, and increased mobility are hallmarks of the EMT. Several molecular mechanisms promote EMT, Including regulation of the levels of specific cell-surface proteins, ECM-degrading enzymes, and altering the expression of certain transcription factors and microRNAs. EMT process is modulated through multiple signaling pathways including the AKT/mTOR pathway. AKT is a key component in numerous processes which was recently shown to regulate the EMT through suppression of the expression of E-cadherin via EMT transcription factors. On the other hand, mTOR complexes can also regulate the EMT through the regulation of cell's actin cytoskeleton by altering the PKC phosphorylation state and direct phosphorylation and activation of Akt. Here we review the effect of AKT and mTOR on EMT and consequently metastasis and cell motility. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The 2H phosphoesterase superfamily (2H family) proteins are widely conserved among organisms. The 2H family is classified into several subgroups, including YjcG-like proteins whose enzymatic activity has not been reported. In the present study, we found that two YjcG-like proteins (Staphylococcus aureus SA0873 and Bacillus subtilis YjcG) have 2'-CPDase activity that hydrolyzes a 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide, thereby producing a nucleotide with a 3'-phosphate. The SA0873 protein selectively hydrolyzes a 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide with a purine base. Four SA0873 mutant proteins (H34A, T36A, H115A, and T117A), in which alanine was substituted for amino acid residues in the HxT/Sx motifs that are conserved in the 2H family, abolished the 2'-CPDase activity. Comparison of three-dimensional structures between the YjcG-like proteins with 2'-CPDase activity and another 2H family subgroup, LigT/2'-5' RNA ligase-like proteins with 3'-CPDase activity, revealed that the orientation of the substrate binding pocket is reversed between the two groups. Our findings revealed that YjcG-like proteins not only have a substrate-binding pocket different from that of LigT/2'-5' RNA ligase-like proteins, but they also have 2'-CPDase activity.

AB Antithrombin is a serine protease inhibitor that exerts a crucial role in hemostasis as the main inhibitor of the coagulation cascade. It plays also critical roles in other processes, such as inflammation and cancer. Here we show that exosomes released by Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells cultured in the presence of heparin incorporate antithrombin from the serum. Exosomal antithrombin is found complexed with the serine protease high temperature requirement A1 (HTRA1), whose cellular levels are increased after serum deprival, the condition used to collect exosomes. Although the biological relevance of the presence of antithrombin in exosomes remains to be investigated, our results suggest a functional interplay between antithrombin and HTRA1.

AB Curcumin shows antiglycemic effects in animals. Curcumin is chemically unstable at physiological pH, and its oxidative degradation products were shown to contribute to its anti-inflammatory effects. Since the degradation products may also contribute to other effects, we analyzed their role in the antiglycemic activity of curcumin. We quantified curcumin-induced release of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) from mouse STC-1 cells that represent enteroendocrine L-cells as a major source of this anti-diabetic hormone. Curcumin induced secretion of GLP-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Two chemically stable analogues of curcumin that do not readily undergo degradation, were less active while two unstable analogues were active secretagogues. Chromatographically isolated spiroepoxide, an unstable oxidative metabolite of curcumin with anti-inflammatory activity, also induced secretion of GLP-1. Stable compounds like the final oxidative metabolite bicyclopentadione, and the major plasma metabolite, curcumin-glucuronide, were inactive. GLP-1 secretion induced by curcumin and its oxidative degradation products was associated with activation of PKC, ERK, and CaM kinase II. Since activity largely correlated with instability of curcumin and the analogues, we tested the extent of covalent binding to proteins in STC-1 cells and found it occurred with similar affinity as N-ethylmaleimide, indicating covalent binding occurred with nucleophilic cysteine residues. These results suggest that oxidative metabolites of curcumin are involved in the antiglycemic effects of curcumin. Our findings support the hypothesis that curcumin functions as a pro-drug requiring oxidative activation to reveal its bioactive metabolites that act by binding to target proteins thereby causing a change in function.

AB Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is a key enzyme of glycolysis which also acts as a mediator of DNA replication and repair in the nucleus. We have cloned and expressed PGK in Brugia malayi. The rBmPGK was found to be 415 amino acid residues long having 45 kDa subunit molecular weight. This enzyme was also identified in different life stages of bovine filarial parasite Setaria cervi. The enzyme activity was highest in microfilarial stage followed by adult female and male as also shown by real time PCR in the present study. Further using BmPGK primers the cDNA prepared from S. cervi was amplified and sequenced which showed 100% homology with Brugia malayi PGK. B. malayi and S. cervi, PGK consists of conserved calmodulin binding domain (CaMBD) having 21 amino acids. In the present study we have shown the CaMBD binds to calcium-calmodulin and regulates its activity. The binding of calmodulin (CaM) with CaMBD was confirmed using calmodulin agarose binding pull down assay, which showed that the rBmPGK binds to CaM agarose-calcium dependent manner. The effect of CaM-Ca2+ on the activity of rBmPGK was studied at different concentration of CaM (0.01-5.0 mu M) and calcium chloride (0.01-100 mu M). The rBmPGK was activated up to 85% in the presence of CaM at 1 mu M and 10 mu M concentration of CaCl2. Interestingly this activation was abrogated by metal chelator EDTA. Similar results were shown in case of Setaria cervi PGK. A significant increase (90 +/- 10) % in ScPGK activity was observed in the presence of CaM and CaCl2 at 1.0 mu M and 1.0 mM respectively, further increase in the conc. of CaCl2, the activity of ScPGK was found to be decreased like rBmPGK. Bioinformatics studies have also confirmed the interaction between CaMBD and CaM which showed CaM interacted to Phe 206, Gln 220, Arg 223 and Asn 224 of rBmPGK CaM binding domain.
   On the basis of these findings, it has been suggested that the activity of filarial PGK could be regulated in cells by Ca2+-CaM depending upon the concentration of calcium. To the best of our knowledge this is first report in filarial parasite. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM). All rights reserved.

AB MET exon 14 skipping (exon 14 Delta) mutations are associated with tumor sensitivity to a number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, however clinical testing for MET gene status remains complicated. We developed a simple allele-specific PCR cDNA-based test, which allowed for the identification of MET exon 14 Delta allele in 35 (2.5%) out of 1415 EGFR mutation-negative lung carcinomas (LCs). MET exon 14 Delta was significantly associated with elderly age and non-smoking status of the patients. A total of 34 (97%) out of 35 tumors carrying MET exon 14 Delta showed preferential expression of the mutated allele; this imbalance was attributed to the down-regulation of the expression of the wild-type gene copy. Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of genomic exon 14 splice site mutations in 24/35 (68.6%) cases, which showed MET exon 14 skipping by PCR. In addition to LCs described above, some carcinomas demonstrated low-abundance MET exon 14 Delta-specific signal. Low-level expression of MET exon 14 Delta allele may potentially compromise the results of allele-specific PCR-based tests, therefore comparison of the level of expression of mutated and normal alleles is essential for the reliability of MET gene testing.

In a present study, GH45 cellulase from Neurospora crassa OR74A (NcCel45A) was characterized both biochemically and structurally. HPLC analysis of the hydrolytic products confirmed the endo-beta(1,4) mode of action of the enzyme. Moreover, such pattern revealed that NcCel45A cannot hydrolyze efficiently oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization smaller than six. The crystal structure of NcCel45A catalytic domain in the apo-form was determined at 1.9 angstrom resolution and the structure of the enzyme bound to cellobiose was solved and refined to 1.8 angstrom resolution. Comparative structural analyses and molecular dynamics simulations show that the enzyme dynamics is affected by substrate binding. Taken together, MD simulations and statistical coupling analysis revealed previously unknown correlation of a loop 6 with the breakdown of cellulose substrates by GH45.

AB Prokaryotes encounter constant and often brutal modifications to their environment. In order to survive, they need to maintain fitness, which includes adapting their protein expression patterns. Many factors control gene expression but this review focuses on just one, namely antisense RNAs (asRNAs), a class of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) characterized by their location in cis and their perfect complementarity with their targets. asRNAs were considered for a long time to be trivial and only to be found on mobile genetic elements. However, recent advances in methodology have revealed that their abundance and potential activities have been underestimated. This review aims to illustrate the role of asRNA in various physiologically crucial functions in both archaea and bacteria, which can be regrouped in three categories: cell maintenance, horizontal gene transfer and virulence. A literature survey of asRNAs demonstrates the difficulties to characterize and assign a role to asRNAs. With the aim of facilitating this task, we describe recent technological advances that could be of interest to identify new asRNAs and to discover their function.

AB Small nucleolar RNAs are generally involved in the modification of target ribosomal RNAs. Other possible functions recently emerged with the discovery of the novel class of snoRNA-derived RNAs or sdRNAs. Since then, additional data has revealed the involvement of both snoRNAs and sdRNAs in tumorigenesis.
   After briefly introducing snoRNA families and functions, this mini-review summarises recently acquired knowledge on snoRNA-related mechanisms associated with cancer. Despite the rapid increase in the number of studies, exactly how snoRNAs lead to cancer remains unclear. However, exciting new research is paving the way for future diagnostic or therapeutic strategies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB Extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) are secreted by nearly all cell types and are now known to play multiple physiological roles. In humans, exRNA populations are found in nearly any physiological liquid and are attracting growing interest as a potential source for biomarker discovery. Human plasma, a readily available sample for biomedical analysis, reported to contain various subpopulations of exRNA, some of which are most likely components of plasma ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), while others are encapsulated into extracellular vesicles (EVs) of different size, origin and composition. This variation explains the extreme complexity of the human exRNA fraction in plasma. In this work, we aimed to characterize exRNA species from blood samples of healthy human donors to achieve the most comprehensive overview of the species, sizes and origins of the exRNA present in plasma fractions. Unbiased analysis of exRNA composition was performed with prefractionation of plasma exRNA followed by library preparation, sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Our results demonstrate that, in addition to "mature", adaptor ligation-competent RNA species (5'-P/3'-OH), human plasma contains a substantial proportion of degraded RNA fragments (5'-OH/3'-P or cycloP), which can be made competent for ligation using appropriate treatments. These degraded RNAs represent the major fraction in the overall population and mostly correspond to rRNA, in contrast to mature products, which mostly contain miRNAs and hY4 RNA fragments. Precipitation polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based kits for EV isolation yield a fraction that is highly contaminated by large RNPs and by RNA loosely bound to EVs. Purer EV preparations are obtained by using proteinase K and RNase A treatment, as well as by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). These samples have rather distinct RNA compositions compared to PEG-precipitated EV preparations and contain a substantial proportion of exRNA of non-human origin, arising from human skin and gut microbiota, including viral microbiota. These exogenous exRNAs represent up to 75-80% of total RNA reads in highly purified extracellular vesicles, paving the way for biomedical exploitation of these nonhuman biomarkers.

AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs) differ structurally from other types of RNAs and are resistant against exoribonucleases. Although they have been detected in all domains of life, it remains unclear how circularization affects or changes functions of these ubiquitous nucleic acid circles. The biogenesis of circRNAs has been mostly described as a backsplicing event, but in archaea, where RNA splicing is a rare phenomenon, a second pathway for circRNA formation was described in the cases of rRNAs processing, tRNA intron excision, and Box C/D RNAs formation. At least in some archaeal species, circRNAs are formed by a ligation step catalyzed by an atypic homodimeric RNA ligase belonging to RnI3 family. In this review, we describe archaeal circRNA transcriptomes obtained using high throughput sequencing technologies on Sulfolobus solfataricus, Pyrococcus abyssi and Nanoarchaeum equitans cells. We will discuss the distribution of circular RNAs among the different RNA categories and present the RnI3 ligase family implicated in the circularization activity. Special focus is given for the description of phylogenetic distributions, protein structures, and substrate specificities of archaeal RNA ligases.

AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed RNA loops produced by a very large number of expressed eukaryotic genes. Initially considered as splicing background and/or splicing side products, recent studies have shown that they are evolutionary conserved and abundant in cells. Yet, their functions remain largely unknown. Because of their circular shape, they were initially categorized as non-coding RNAs. However, recent studies based on mass spectrometry analysis indicate that some cytoplasmic circRNAs are effectively translated into detectable peptides. This raises the interesting question of which mechanisms regulate the translation initiation of those circular transcripts, i.e. unable to recruit the small ribosome subunit through the 5' cap. A possible mechanism for alternative translation initiation is the presence of an IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site) that allows direct recruitment of initiation factors and ribosomes on the RNA independently from the cap. This is the case for several circRNAs that exhibit IRESs upstream from the start codon. Yet, another process seems to be involved in initiating the translation of circRNAs: the presence of N(-)(6)methyladenosine (m(6)A) residues. These m(6)A can promote cap-independent translation and have been shown to be enriched in circRNAs. Interestingly, these two alternative translation initiation processes are generally activated under cellular stress to allow expression of specific stress response genes. These discoveries therefore link circRNA translation to cellular response to stress conditions, raising new enquiries about the regulation of circRNA expression under stress conditions and their functions. This review provides a state of the art on this emerging area. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB RNA modifications regulate gene expression by impacting different steps in RNA processing. They are as diverse as they are important for the cell. Most of them have been identified around 1970 and the recent development of high-throughput techniques has shed some insights on their prevalence and function. They are present in all RNA types, but their regulation is still not fully understood. The most described RNA modification is methylation, which requires S-adenosylmethionine as a methyl donor, produced through the one carbon metabolism. Different micronutrients (i.e. folate and vitamin B12) are required to properly generate S-adenosylmethionine, making nutrition a strong regulating factor. Although micronutrients have been extensively described to affect epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, protein histone post-translational modifications or miRNAs, far less is known about RNA methylation.
   Here, we review what is known about the regulation of RNA methylation by micronutrients and the physiological consequences of deficiencies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM). All rights reserved.

AB RNA modifications are involved in numerous biological processes. These modifications are constitutive or modulated in response to adaptive processes and can impact RNA base-pairing formation, protein recognition, RNA structure and stability. tRNAs are the most abundantly modified RNA molecules. Analysis of the roles of their modifications in response to stress, environmental changes, and infections caused by pathogens, has fueled new research areas. Nevertheless, the detection of modified nucleotides in RNAs is still a challenging task. We present here a reliable method to identify and localize tRNA modifications, which was applied to the human pathogenic bacteria, Staphyloccocus aureus. The method is based on a separation of tRNA species on a two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by nano liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We provided a list of modifications mapped on 25 out of the 40 tRNA species (one isoacceptor for each amino acid). This method can be easily used to monitor the dynamics of tRNA modifications in S. aureus in response to stress adaptation and during infection of the host, a relatively unexplored field.

AB Non-coding RNAs associate with proteins to form ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), such as ribosome, box C/D snoRNPs, H/ACA snoRNPs, ribonuclease P, telomerase and spliceosome to ensure cell viability. The assembly of these RNA-protein complexes relies on the ability of the RNA to adopt the correct bound conformation. K-turn motifs represent ubiquitous binding platform for proteins found in several cellular environment. This structural motif has an internal three-nucleotide bulge flanked on its 3' side by a G.A/A.G tandem pairs followed by one or two non-Watson-Crick pairs, and on its 5' side by a classical RNA helix. This peculiar arrangement induces a strong curvature of the phosphodiester backbone, which makes it conducive to multiple tertiary interactions. SNU13/Snu13p (Human/Yeast) binds specifically the U14 C/D box snoRNA K-turn sequence motif. This event is the prerequisite to promote the assembly of the RNP, which contains NOP58/Nop58 and NOP56/Nop56 core proteins and the 2'-O-methyl-transferase, Fibrillarin/Noplp. The U14 small nucleolar RNA is a conserved non-coding RNA found in yeast and vertebrates required for the pre-rRNA maturation and ribose methylation. Here, we report the solution structure of the free U14 snoRNA K-turn motif (kt-U14) as determined by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. We demonstrate that a major fraction of free kt-U14 adopts a pre-folded conformation similar to protein bound K-turn, even in the absence of divalent ions. In contrast to the kt-U4 or tyrS RNA, kt-U14 displays a sharp bent in the phosphodiester backbone. The U.U and G.A tandem base pairs are formed through weak hydrogen bonds. Finally, we show that the structure of kt-U14 is stabilized upon Snu13p binding. The structure of the free U14 RNA is the first reference example for the canonical motifs of the C/D box snoRNA family.

AB DEAD-box helicases play central roles in the metabolism of many RNAs and ribonucleoproteins by assisting their synthesis, folding, function and even their degradation or disassembly. They have been implicated in various phenomena, and it is often difficult to rationalize their molecular roles from in vivo studies. Once purified in vitro, most of them only exhibit a marginal activity and poor specificity. The current model is that they gain specificity and activity through interaction of their intrinsically disordered domains with specific RNA or proteins. DDX3 is a DEAD-box cellular helicase that has been involved in several steps of the HIV viral cycle, including transcription, RNA export to the cytoplasm and translation. In this study, we investigated DDX3 biochemical properties in the context of a biological substrate. DDX3 was overexpressed, purified and its enzymatic activities as well as its RNA binding properties were characterized using both model substrates and a biological substrate, HIV-1 gRNA. Biochemical characterization of DDX3 in the context of a biological substrate identifies HIV-1 gRNA as a rare example of specific substrate and unravels the extent of DDX3 ATPase activity. Analysis of DDX3 binding capacity indicates an unexpected dissociation between its binding capacity and its biochemical activity. We further demonstrate that interaction of DDX3 with HIV-1 gRNA relies both on specific RNA determinants and on the disordered N- and C-terminal regions of the protein. These findings shed a new light regarding the potentiality of DDX3 biochemical activity supporting its multiple cellular functions.

AB Crystallographic studies of RNA/protein complexes are primordial for the understanding of recognition determinants and catalytic mechanisms in the case of enzymes. However, due to the flexibility and propensity to conformational heterogeneity of RNAs, as well as the mostly electrostatic interactions of RNA/protein complexes, they are difficult to crystallize. We present here a method to trap the two interacting partners in a covalent complex, based on a modified reactive RNA allowing the use of the full range of common crystallogenesis tools. We demonstrate the practicability of our approach with the production of a covalent complex of the Thermus thermophilus m(1) A58 tRNA modification enzyme, and a modified stem loop mimicking the natural substrate of the enzyme.

AB The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a universally conserved non-coding ribonucleoprotein complex that is essential for targeting transmembrane and secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum. Its composition and size varied during evolution. In mammals, SRP contains one RNA molecule, 7SL RNA, and six proteins: SRP9, 14, 19, 54, 68 and 72. Despite a very good understanding of the SRP structure and of the SRP assembly in vitro, how SRP is assembled in vivo remains largely enigmatic. Here we review current knowledge on how the 7SL RNA is assembled with core proteins to form functional RNP particles in cells. SRP biogenesis is believed to take place both in the nucleolus and in the cytoplasm and to rely on the survival of motor neuron complex, whose defect leads to spinal muscular atrophy.

AB Osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone tumor characterized by a high level of genetic instability and recurring DNA deletions and amplifications. This study aims to investigate how microRNA-496 (miR-496) affects proliferation, invasion, and migration of human osteosarcoma (OS) cells and in vivo tumorigenicity by targeting eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). Microarray-based gene expression profiling involving OS was used in order to identify differentially expressed genes. After that, the interaction between miR-496 expression and OS patients' survival rate was determined. The expression pattern of miR-496 and eIF4E was determined in OS tissues and cells, and their potential relationship was further analyzed by using the dual luciferase reporter gene assay. With the purpose of identifying the functional role miR-496 in OS, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were measured in cells treated with miR-496 mimic or inhibitor. A nude mouse model was constructed in order to investigate the regulatory effects of miR-496 on tumor growth in vivo by regulating eIF4E. OS cells exhibited a down-regulated expression of miR-496 and an up-regulated expression of eIF4E. miR-496 expression was positively correlated to OS patients' survival rate. Bioinformatics analysis suggested eIF4E would be a direct target of miR-496, and the expression of eIF4E was inhibited by overexpression of miR-496. miR-496 elevation was found to exert suppressive effects on OS cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and tumor growth in vivo, with the effects being reversed using miR-496 depletion. Altogether, the above findings support a conclusion that miR-496 could work as a tumor suppressor in OS through down-regulation of eIF4E. This study may provide a novel target for treatment of OS.

Some parasite cathepsins have fibrinogenolytic and fibrinolytic activity, suggesting that they may contribute to maintain blood meal fluidity for extended feeding periods. Here, it is shown that BmGTI (Rhipicephalus [Boophilus] microplus Gut Thrombin Inhibitor), a protein previously described as an inhibitor of fibrinogen hydrolysis and platelet aggregation by thrombin, and BmCL1 (Rhipicephalus [Boophilus] microplus Cathepsin-L like 1) are the same protein, hereinafter referred to using the earliest name (BmCL1). To further characterize BmCL1, Rhipicephalus microplus native and recombinant (rBmCL1) proteins were obtained. Native BmCL1 was isolated using thrombin-affinity chromatography, and it displays thrombin inhibition activity. We subsequently investigated rBmCL1 interaction with thrombin. We show that rBmCL1 and thrombin have a dissociation constant (K-D) of 130.2 +/- 11.2 nM, and this interaction likely occurs due to a more electronegative surface of BmCL1 at pH 7.5 than at pH 5.0, which may favor an electrostatic binding to positively charged thrombin exosites. During BmCL1-thrombin interaction, thrombin is not degraded or inhibited. rBmCL1 impairs thrombin-induced fibrinogen clotting via a fibrinogenolytic activity. Fibrinogen degradation by BmCL1 occurs by the hydrolysis of Aa- and BB-chains, generating products similar to those produced by fibrinogenolytic cathepsins from other organisms. In conclusion, BmCL1 likely has an additional role in R. microplus blood digestion, besides its role in hemoglobin degradation at acid pH. BmCL1 fibrinogenolytic activity indicates a proteolytic activity in the neutral lumen of tick midgut, contributing to maintain the fluidity of the ingested blood, which remains to be confirmed in vivo.

AB Huntington's diseases (HD) is a very devastating disease caused by r(CAG) expansion in HTT gene, encoding the huntingtin protein. r(CAG) expansion causes disease via multiple pathways including, 1) loss of normal protein function like sequestration of RNA binding protein such as Muscleblind-like (MBNL) and nucleolin, 2) Gain of function for mutant proteins and 3) repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation; in which expanded r(CAG) translates into toxic poly glu, poly ser, or poly ala without the use of any canonical start codon. Herein, we have rationally designed and synthesized a unique class of pyridocoumarin derivatives that target the r(CAG)(exp) involved in HD and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) pathogenesis. Notably, compounds 3 and 15 showed higher affinity (nanomolar K-d) and selectivity for diseased r(CAG)(exp) RNA compared to regular duplex AU-paired RNA. Interestingly, both scaffolds are cell permeable, exhibit low toxicity to healthy fibroblast cells and are also capable of reducing the level of poly Q aggregation in cellular models. Indeed, our current study offers promising facet for selectively targeting repeats containing RNAs that cause severe diseases like HD and SCAs.

AB Snake venom L-amino acid oxidases (svLAAOs) are an interesting class of enzymes with important biological activities. Their participation in key metabolic processes, including pathological disorders, suggest that svLAAOs are potential lead compounds in drug discovery. However, their short-term stability defies their applications. This paper describes the stability studies together with functional and structural characterization of the LAAO bordonein-L. It has 498 amino acid residues, one N-glycosylation site and two disulfide bonds, revealed by high-resolution MS/MS. Molecular modeling approach showed its monomer folds into three conserved domains: FAD, substrate and helical domains. Differential scanning fluorimetry showed the enzyme tends to destabilize from neutral to basic pHs and in presence of mono/bivalent ions and it is highly stabilized by acid pHs and its substrates. However, high concentrations of L-amino acids decrease bordonein-L enzyme activity. Dynamic light scattering revealed bordonein-L remains in the dimeric and monodisperse form, so aggregation does not cause the rapidly decrease of enzyme activity. In vitro, the enzyme exhibited cytotoxicity against fibroblast cell line and killed Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes, intensified by substrate addition. Concluding, our results provide biochemistry and biophysical insights to improve LAAOs stability and better approaches to long-term storage. Moreover, our study emphasizes the importance of proper buffers choice mainly in cell-based assays. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB Acylpeptidyl-oligopeptidase (AOP), which has been recently identified as a novel enzyme in a periodontopathic bacterium, Porphyromonas gingivalis, removes di- and tri-peptides from N-terminally acylated polypeptides, with a preference for hydrophobic P1-position amino acid residues. To validate enzymatic properties of AOP, characteristics of two bacterial orthologues from Bacteroides dorei (BdAOP), a Gram-negative intestinal rod, and Lysinibacillus sphaericus (LsAOP), a Gram-positive soil rod, were determined. Like P. gingivalis AOP (PgAOP), two orthologues more efficiently hydrolyzed N-terminal acylated peptidyl substrates than non-acylated ones. Optimal pH was shifted from 7.0 to 8.9 for N-acylated to 8.5-9.5 for non-acylated substrates, indicating preference for non-charged hydrophobic N-terminal residues. Hydrophobic P1- and P2-position preferences were common in the three AOPs, although PgAOP preferred Leu and the others preferred Phe at the P1 position. In vitro mutagenesis demonstrated that Phe(647) in PgAOP was responsible for the P1 Leu preference. In addition, bacterial AOPs commonly liberated acetyl-Ser(1)-Tyr(2) from alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. Taken together, although these three bacterial AOPs exhibited some variations in biochemical properties, the present study demonstrated the existence of a group of exopeptidases that preferentially liberates mainly dipeptides from N-terminally acylated polypeptides with a preference for hydrophobic P1 and P2-position residues.

AB Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are longer than 200 nts non-coding transcripts and have recently emerged as one of the largest and significantly diverse RNA families whereas microRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved short single-stranded ncRNAs (similar to 18-22 nucleotides). As families of small and long evolutionarily conserved ncRNAs, lncRNAs activate and repress genes via a variety of mechanisms at both transcriptional and translational levels, while miRNAs regulate protein-coding gene expression mainly through mRNA degradation or silencing, These ncRNAs have been proved to be involved in multiple biological functions, such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, angiogenesis and apoptosis. Today, while majority of studies have focused on defining the regulatory functions of lncRNAs and miRNAs, limited information have now available for the mutual regulations of lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNA. Thus, the underlying molecular mechanisms, in particularly the interactions among lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNA in development, growth, metastasis and therapeutic potential of cancer still remain obscure. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is known as the third most common and fourth leading cancer death worldwide. Increasing evidence showed the close correlations among aberrant expressions of lncRNAs, miRNAs and the occurrence, development of CRC. This review summarize the potential links among these RNAs in following three areas: 1, The biogenesis and roles of miRNAs in CRC; 2, The biogenesis and functions of lncRNAs in CRC; 3, The interactions among lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNA in tumorigensis, growth, progression, EMT formation, chemoradiotherapy resistance, and therapeutic potential in CRC. We believe that identifying diverging lncRNAs, miRNAs and relevant genes, their interactions and complex molecular regulatory networks will provide important clues for understanding the mechanism and developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for CRC. Further efforts are warranted to bring the promise of regulating their activities into clinical utilities. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB Human apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease APEI is a crucial enzyme of the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which is in charge of recognition and initiation of removal of AP-sites in DNA. It is known that some single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants of APEI have a reduced activity as compared to wild-type APEl. It has been hypothesized that genetic variation in APEI might be responsible for an increased risk of some types of cancer. In the present work, analysis of SNPs of the APE] gene was performed to select the set of variants having substitutions of amino acid residues on the surface of the enzyme globule and in the DNA-binding site, thereby affecting protein-protein interactions or the catalytic reaction, respectively. For seven APEI variants (R221C, N222H, R237A, G241R, M270T, R274Q and P311S), conformational dynamics and catalytic activities were examined. The conformational changes in the molecules of APEI variants and in a DNA substrate were recorded as fluorescence changes of Trp and 2-aminopurine residues, respectively, using the stopped-flow technique. The results made it possible to determine the kinetic mechanism underlying the interactions of the APEI variants with DNA substrates, to calculate the rate constants of the elementary stages, and to identify the stages of the process affected by mutation.

AB Aberrant expression of cancer testis antigens (CTAs) is reported in tumors, especially those with sternness properties. A number of CTAs can induce epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and promote cancer stem cells (CSCs) characteristics. We aimed in this study to analyze the correlation between NY-ESO1 and TWIST1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), as well as their impact on EMT process. Gene expression profiling of NY-ESO1 and TWIST1 was performed in 43 esophageal tumors compared to their margin normal tissues of using qRT-PCR, and their correlation with clinicopathological variables of the patients was evaluated. In silico analysis of the NY-ESO1, epithelial and mesenchymal cell markers and also their promoter sequences was executed. ESCC cell lines KYSE-30 and YM-1 were transduced to ectopically express TWIST1 using a retroviral system, followed by qRT-PCR mRNA expression analysis to reveal the probable correlation among TWIST1, NY-ESO1 and EMT markers gene expression. Scratch assay was performed to estimate migration of TWIST1-induced cells. Overexpression of TWIST1 and NY-ESO1 mRNA was observed in 42% and 39.5% (P < 0.05) of tumors, respectively. Expression of the genes was significantly correlated with each other (p = 0.005). TWIST1 and NY-ESO1 overexpression was significantly associated with stage of progression and size of tumors, respectively. A direct association between TWIST1 and NY-ESO1 mRNA expression was confirmed by induced ectopic expression of TWIST1 in ESCC cell lines KYSE-30 and YM-1. TWISTI-induced cells led to increase migration in ESCC cell line.
   Furthermore, significant up-regulation of EMT markers was observed following ectopic expression of TWIST1 in these cells. Based on our findings, it may be proposed that a vital association is exist between the EMT and the acquisition of cancer stemness state in tumor cells through the TWIST1/NY-ESO1 axis and it can be a critical hallmark in ESCC tumorigenesis.

AB Liver fibrosis (LF) is known as a result of the progressive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), and always ascribed to chronic liver diseases. Advanced liver fibrosis results in cirrhosis, liver failure, portal hypertension, and even multi-organ dysfunction and will bring up a health care burden worldwide. Cyclic AMP response-element binding protein (CREB), as a critical transcriptional factor, binds with conserved cAMP response-element (CRE), which is located in the promoter of targeted genes, to regulate the transcription. In the past decades, numerous studies have contributed to improved understanding of the links between CREB and liver fibrosis. In this review, we will summarize molecular mechanisms of CREB pathways and discuss contributions of CREB to liver fibrosis, focusing on activation and proliferation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), proliferation of cholangiocytes, deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) and inflammation, for the development of antifibrotic therapies.

AB Saccharomyces cerevisiae has high level of inorganic polyphosphate and a multicomponent system of its metabolism, including polyphosphatases Ppx1, Ppn1, Ddp1, and Ppn2.
   The aim of the study was to construct the yeast strain overexpressing Ppn2 and to compare the properties of Ppn2, Ppx1, Ppn1, and Ddp1 purified from overexpressing strains of S. cerevisiae. We overexpressed Ppn2 in S. cerevisiae under a strong constitutive promoter of the yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-encoding gene and suggested biochemical criteria for distinguishing among yeast polyphosphatases, which is important for their identification and understanding of their functions. Ppn2, Ppn1, and Ddp1 had endopolyphosphatase activities, whereas Ppx1 did not. Ppx1 and Ppn1 exhibited high and Ddp1 and Ppn2 low exopolyphosphatase activity: 240, 500, 0.05 and 0.1 U/mg protein, respectively. The enzymes had distinct patterns of exopolyphosphatase activities stimulation by divalent metal ions. Ppn2, Ppn1 and Ddp1 displayed endopolyphosphatase activity in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+. The endopolyphosphatase activities of Ppn2 and Ppn1 were induced by 0.01 mM of Co(2+)or Zn2+, whereas that of Ddp1 required 0.1 mM of these cations. The endopolyphosphatase activity of Ppn1 was inhibited by 0.01 mg mL(-1) of heparin, while endopolphosphatase activity of Ppn2 was weakly sensitive to 0.25 mg mL(-1) of heparin. The Ppx1 and Ppn1 activity with guanosine tetraphosphate was nearly 80% of activity with long-chain polyphosphates. The Ppn1 hydrolyzed dATP, while Ppx1 did not. The differences in the mode of polyphosphate hydrolysis, substrate specificity, metal ion dependence and cell localization suggest distinct roles of these enzymes in yeast.

AB Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) has a critical role in maintaining tumor phenotype and survival of already transformed murine pheochromocytoma (pheo) cells (MPC4/30) and it is required for the initial establishment of these tumors. However, the role of local IGF1/IGF1R system in tumor microenvironment has not been fully understood. In vivo, by subcutaneous injection of pheo cells in heterozygous IGF1R knockout mice (L/n), we found that the time of noticeable tumor appearance was delayed, and incidence was decreased in L/n group compared to control (L/L) mice. Once established, tumor proliferation, vascularization or growth rate did not differ between groups. In vitro, fibroblast from L/n and L/L mice were cultured to generate conditioned media (CM) and differential matrixes on which pheo cells were seeded. Proliferation rate was higher when pheo cells were cultured with CM, or in differential matrix generated by L/L murine fibroblasts. A diminished fibronectin (FN) expression and secretion from L/n fibroblast was associated with decreased expression of integrin subunits in tumor cells. Also, soluble factors as IGF1 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) were reduced. Our data suggest that IGF1 signaling through IGF1R may contribute to tumor cells anchorage and survival by interaction with both matrix and soluble factors produced by tumor microenvironment fibroblasts.

AB Protein phosphorylation is one of the main mechanisms by which signals are transmitted in eukaryotic cells, and it plays a crucial regulatory role in almost all cellular processes. In yeast, more than half of the proteins are phosphorylated in at least one site, and over 20,000 phosphopeptides have been experimentally verified. However, the functional consequences of these phosphorylation events for most of the identified phosphosites are unknown. A family of protein interaction domains selectively recognises phosphorylated motifs to recruit regulatory proteins and activate signalling pathways. Nine classes of dedicated modules are coded by the yeast genome: 14-3-3, FHA, WD40, BRCT, WW, PBD, and SH2. The recognition specificity relies on a few residues on the target protein and has coevolved with kinase specificity. In the present study, we review the current knowledge concerning yeast phospho-binding domains and their networks. We emphasise the relevance of both positive and negative amino acid selection to orchestrate the highly regulated outcomes of inter- and intra-molecular interactions. Finally, we hypothesise that only a small fraction of yeast phosphorylation events leads to the creation of a docking site on the target molecule, while many have a direct effect on the protein or, as has been proposed, have no function at all.

AB This study aimed at the participation of lncRNA H19, endothelial NADPH oxidases (NOX4) and miR-148b-3p in hypoxia stress in human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HHSEC), and clarifying the relationship among them. The expression of lnc H19, NOX4 and miR-148b-3p in cirrhotic patients and hypoxic HHSEC were measured by RT-PCR. The nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide content in HHSEC were determined using ultraviolet chromatometry. The protein levels of NOX4, endothelial NOS (eNOS) and phosphorylated eNOS (p-eNOS) were measured via western blotting. The interaction between NOX4 promoter and lnc H19/miR-148b-3p was measured by dual-luciferase reporter gene detection system. The present results indicated that the expressions of NOX4 mRNA and lnc H19 were increased but miR148b-3p was decreased in both cirrhotic patients and hypoxic HHSEC. Further, hypoxia induced the upregulation of hydrogen peroxide and the down-regulation of eNOS/NO signaling in HHSEC. And these symptoms were ameliorated by lnc H19 shRNA and miR-148b-3p mimics. But the beneficial effects of lnc H19 shRNA and miR-148b-3p mimics were further abolished by miR-148b-3p inhibitor and NOX4 over-expression, respectively. In addition, NOX4 was a direct, negatively regulated target of miR-148b-3p, and miR-148b-3p was negatively regulated by lnc H19. Collectively, lnc H19 is a negatively regulator of microRNA-148b-3p, and participate in hypoxia stress in HHSEC via positively regulating NOX4 and negatively regulating eNOS/NO signaling.

AB RNA amplification has extensive applications on biochemistry and its related fields. Here, we present an isothermal strategy named rolling circle reverse transcription-mediated RNA amplification (RCRT-MRA) to amplify small RNAs with accurate length and sequence. The target RNA and complementary DNA were circularized to serve as amplicons replicated via the rolling circle mechanism. The transcription product consisting of tandemly repeated RNA units, was monomerized by site-specific cleavage to generate amplified RNA with authentic length and sequence. T4 DNA ligase was chosen to circularize RNA template for its high efficiency and low cost. SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase was found to be able to catalyze the RCRT reaction on the circular RNA template, and the reaction efficiency was enhanced by adding the nicking enzyme, Nb.BbvCI to the RCRT system. E. Coli RNA polymerase, instead of the commonly used T7 RNA polymerase, was applied to synthesize long-strand RNA product for its high universality and processivity. Under the optimized conditions, small RNAs can be precisely amplified by 10(5-6) folds. The fidelity of the established method was demonstrated by the accordance of the sequencing result and the initial RNA sequences. Free from expensive thermal cycler (necessary for RT-PCR-based amplification), precise replication of the initial RNA and high fidelity will enable the established strategy to be applied in RNA-seq, mRNA profiling, microarray analysis and RNA-based SELEX as well.

AB Widely dispersed throughout the entire body tissues, gangliosides (GGs) are essential components of neuronal cell membranes, where exhibit a vital role in neuronal function and brain development, directly influencing the neural tube formation, neurogenesis, neurotransmission, etc. Due to several factors, partial or complete closing faults of the fetal neural tube may occur in the first trimester of pregnancy, generating a series of neural tube defects (NTD), among which anencephaly. The absence in anencephaly of the forebrain and skull bones determines the exposure to the amniotic fluid of the remaining brain tissue and the spinal cord, causing the degeneration of the nervous system tissue. Based on the previously achieved information related to the direct alteration of neural development with deficient concentration of several GGs, a systematic and comparative mass spectrometry (MS) mapping assay on GGs originating from fetuses in different intrauterine developmental stages, i.e. the 29th (denoted An29), 35th (An35) and the 37th (An37) gestational weeks was here conducted. Our approach, based on Orbitrap MS under high sensitivity, resolution and mass accuracy conditions, enabled for the first time the nanoelectrospray ionization, detection and identification of over 150 glycoforms, mainly novel, polysialylated species. Such a pattern, specific for incipient developmental stages reliably documents the brain development stagnation, characteristic for anencephaly. Further, the fragmentation MS2-MS3 experiments by collision induced dissociation (CID) confirmed the incidence in all three samples of GT2(d18:1/16:2) as a potential biomarker. Therefore, this fingerprinting of the anencephalic gangliosidome may serve in development of approaches for routine screening and early diagnosis.

AB Extra-cellular signal regulated kinase-5 (Erk-5), a transcriptional activator and regulator of endothelial cells (ECs) homeostasis, has been implicated in shear stress-induced endothelial dysfunction (ED), however its role in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)- induced ED during metabolic stress is not known. Herein, regulation and function of Erk-5 in oxLDL-induced EC death, inflammation and dysfunction has been investigated. Primary Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (pHUVECs) were stimulated with oxLDL. MTT and Trypan blue exclusion assays to assess cell viability, RT-qPCR and Western blotting assays to determine expression of endothelial and inflammatory markers and ED mediators at mRNA and protein levels, respectively were performed. Monocyte adhesion assay was performed to examine monocytes adherence to oxLDL-stimulated pHUVECs. The exposure of oxLDL induced a dose- and time-dependent decrease in pHUVECs viability, which concurred with decreased Erk-5 expression. Further, oxLDL (100 mu g/ml) decreased the expression of endothelial markers eNOS and vWF, and increased the expression of ICAM-1, at both mRNA and protein levels. SiRNA-mediated silencing of Erk-5 or its inhibition showed that changes in eNOS, vWF and ICAM-1 expression could be mediated through Erk-5. Furthermore, oxLDL decreased the levels of Erk-5's upstream regulator MEK5 and downstream regulators Mef2c and KLF2, which were similar to their expressions in Erk-5 silenced cells. Fisetin, a phytochemical and bioflavonoid, could reduce the effect of oxLDL in ECs by upregulating the expression of endothelial markers including Erk-5, and downregulating the expression of inflammation markers. These results suggest that Erk-5 could be a critical regulator of oxLDL-induced EC death, inflammation and dysfunction via downregulation of Erk-5/Mef2c-KLF2 signaling pathway, which can be ameliorated by a bioflavonoid, fisetin.

TI Overexpression of CKIP-1 alleviates hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte injury

AB Acute myocardial infarction causes irreversible myocardial damage and is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Casein kinase 2 interacting protein-1 (CKIP-1) has been suggested to confer cytoprotection against various pathologic injuries. However, it remains unclear whether CKIP-1 regulates myocardial infarction-induced cardiomyocyte injury. This study aimed to explore the potential role of CKIP-1 in regulating hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte injury and reveal the underlying mechanism. The results demonstrated that hypoxia-exposed cardiomyocytes showed lower CKIP-1 expression. CKIP-1 restoration by transfecting a CKIP-1 expression vector significantly improved viability and reduced apoptosis in hypoxia-treated cardiomyocytes. Moreover, CKIP-1 overexpression suppressed hypoxia-induced oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes. Mechanism research revealed that CKIP-1 overexpression reduced the expression of kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and increased the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), actions which resulted in an increase in the transcription of Nrf2 target genes. However, Keap1 overexpression partially reversed CKIP-1-mediated Nrf2 promotion and cardioprotection. Notably, the blockade of Nrf2 signaling also significantly abolished CKIP-1-mediated cardioprotection. Overall, our findings demonstrate that CKIP-1 alleviates hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte injury through the up-regulation of Nrf2 antioxidant signaling via the down-regulation of Keap1, suggesting a potential role for CKIP-1 in myocardial infarction.

AB Despite the improvement of diagnostic methods and anticancer therapeutics, the human population is still facing an increasing incidence of several types of cancers. According to the World Health Organization, this growing trend would be partly linked to our environment, with around 20% of cancers stemming from exposure to environmental contaminants, notably chemicals like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs are widespread pollutants in our environment resulting from incomplete combustion or pyrolysis of organic material, and thus produced by both natural and anthropic sources; notably benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), i.e. the prototypical molecule of this family, that can be detected in cigarette smoke, diesel exhaust particles, occupational-related fumes, and grilled food. This molecule is a well-recognized carcinogen belonging to group 1 carcinogens. Indeed, it can target the different steps of the carcinogenic process and all cancer hallmarks. Interestingly, H+ dynamics have been described as key parameters for the occurrence of several, if not all, of these hallmarks. However, information regarding the role of such parameters during environmental carcinogenesis is still very scarce. The present review will thus mainly give an overview of the impact of B[a]P on H+ dynamics in liver cells, and will show how such alterations might impact different aspects related to the finely-tuned balance between cell death and survival processes, thereby likely favoring environmental carcinogenesis. In total, the main objective of this review is to encourage further research in this poorly explored field of environmental molecular toxicology.

AB Objectives: The potential implication of micro-RNAs (miRs) in the negative association between diabetes and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has so far never been addressed. The aim of this study was to compare miR expression between diabetic and non-diabetic patients with AAA.
   Methods: Ten diabetic patients were prospectively included and compared to 10 age- and sex-matched non-diabetic patients with infrarenal AAA. A profiling analysis of 752 human miRs was performed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using miRCURY LNA Universal RT microRNA PCR (Exiqon-Qiagen (R)). miR that showed significant differential expression (P <0.05) were selected and further analyzed in the entire cohort in sera, plasma and aneurysmal aortic tissues.
   Results: Four miRs were significantly differentially expressed in PBMCs of diabetic patients compared to non-diabetics: 3 were upregulated (miR-144-3p, 20a-5p and 188-3p) and 1 downregulated (miR-548k). miR-144-3p and miR-548k were also increased in aneurysmal tissue and miR-20a-5p was increased in serum. The expression of miR-20a-5p in PBMCs was correlated with fructosamine concentration (r = 0.62, p = 0.006).
   Conclusions: Even if further studies are required to determine their direct role in AAA, these miRs could represent interesting new targets. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM). All rights reserved.

AB We previously reported that SOX4 is overexpressed in endometrial cancer and that it partially contributes to hypermethylation of miR-129-2 and miR-203. The current study seeks to identify methylation and expression levels of the SOX gene family in endometrial carcinomas. Methylation levels of the 16 SOX gene family members were measured by combining bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA), MassARRAY, and pyrosequencing assays of cell lines and endometrial cancer samples. Gene expression was determined by RT-qPCR. The methylation level of the SOX11 locus was correlated with clinicopathologic factors in primary endometrial tumors and in TCGA endometrial cohort. It was also examined in DNA of serum and endometrial specimens from a longitudinal cohort of early stage endometrial cancer patients. COBRA assays indicated that hypermethylation of SOX1, SOX2, SOX11, SOX14, SOX15, SOX17, and SOX18 was present in endometrial cancer cell lines and not in the normal control. SOX11 expression was reactivated only by a DNA methylation inhibitor. Moreover, aberrant DNA methylation of SOX11 was detected in the majority of endometrioid endometrial carcinomas (n=114) and none of the 22 adjacent normal endometrial samples (P<0.0001). The methylation status of SOX11 associated significantly with microsatellite instability and MLH1 methylation in endometrial tumors (P<0.0001), and this finding was validated in TCGA endometrial cohort. Furthermore, SOX11 was not hypermethylated in serum DNA from early stage endometrial cancer patients. This study found that hypermethylation of SOX11 is common in endometrial carcinomas and strongly associates with microsatellite instability and MLH1 methylation.

AB Rbp38 is a protein exclusively found in trypanosomatid parasites, including Leishmania amazonensis, the etiologic agent of tegumentar leishmaniasis in the Americas. The protein was first described as a Leishmania tarentolae mitochondrial RNA binding protein. Later, it was shown that the trypanosomes Rbp38 orthologues were exclusively found in the mitochondria and involved in the stabilization and replication of kinetoplast DNA (kDNA). In contrast, L. amazonensis Rbp38 (LaRbp38), co-purifies with telomerase activity and interacts not only with kDNA but also with telomeric DNA, although shares with its counterparts high sequence identity and a putative N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS). To understand how LaRbp38 interacts both with nuclear and kDNA, we have first investigated its subcellular localization. Using hydroxy-urea synchronized L. amazonensis promastigotes we could show that LaRbp38 shuttles from mitochondria to the nucleus at late S and G2 phases. Further, we identified a non-classical nuclear localization signal (NLS) at LaRbp38 C-terminal that binds with importin alpha, a protein involved in the nuclear transport of several proteins. Also, we obtained LaRbp38 truncated forms among which, some of them also showed an affinity for both telomeric DNA and kDNA. Analysis of these truncated forms showed that LaRbp38 DNA-binding region is located between amino acid residues 95-235. Together, our findings strongly suggest that LaRbp38 is multifunctional with dual subcellular localization. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB The genus Populus is an effective model in tree genetics. This genus includes dioecious species and, recently, whole genome resequencing of P. trichocarpa and P. balsamifera enabled the identification of sex-linked regions and sex-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These results created new opportunities to study sex determination in poplars. In the present work, we performed deep sequencing of genes encoding METHYLTRANSFERASEI (MET1) and homolog of ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR 17 (ARR17), which are localized in a sex-linked region of Populus genome and contain a number of sex-associated SNPs. Amplicon libraries for 38 samples of P. x sibirica (19 males and 19 females) were sequenced on MiSeq Illumina (300 nt paired-end reads) and approximately 4000x coverage was obtained for each sample. In total, from 80 to 179 SNPs were detected in poplar individuals for MET1, and from 16 to 49 SNPs were detected for ARR17. We identified 17 sex-specific SNPs (11 in MET1 and 6 in ARR17) - they were present in all males but absent in all females. For identified sex-specific SNP sites, females were homozygous, while males were heterozygous. Moreover, colocation of sex-specific SNPs confirming the XY sex-determination system of poplars was revealed: in one allelic variant, males had the same nucleotides as females, while in the other, sex-specific SNPs were present. Based on the data obtained, we developed and successfully applied a high-resolution melting-based approach for sex identification in poplars. The developed molecular markers are useful for distinguishing between male and female poplars in scientific research and can also be applied to select male-only genotypes for use in city landscaping and production of paper, pulp, and biofuel.

AB Snake venoms are a rich source of enzymes such as metalloproteinases, serine proteinases phospholipases A2 and myotoxins, that have been well characterized structurally and functionally. However, hyaluronidases (E.C.3.2.1.35) have not been studied extensively. In this study, we describe the biochemical and molecular features of a hyaluronidase (Hyal-Ba) isolated from the venom of the Peruvian snake Bothrops atrox. Hyal-Ba was purified by a combination of ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. Purified Hyal-Ba is a 69-kDa (SDS-PAGE) monomeric glycoprotein with an N-terminal amino acid sequence sharing high identity with homologous snake venom hyaluronidases. Detected associated carbohydrates were hexoses (16.38%), hexosamines (2.7%) and sialic acid (0.69%). Hyal-Ba selectively hydrolyzed only hyaluronic acid (HA; specific activity = 437.5 U/mg) but it did not hydrolyze chondroitin sulfate or heparin. The optimal pH and temperature for maximum activity were 6.0 and 40 degrees C, respectively, and its Km was 0.31 mu M. Its activity was inhibited by EDTA, iodoacetate, 2-mercaptoethanol, TLCK and dexamethasone. Na+ and K+ (0.2 M) positively affect hyaluronidase activity; while Mg2+, Br2+, Ba2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+ reduced catalytic activity. Hyal-Ba potentiates the hemorrhagic and hemolytic activity of whole venom, but decreased subplantar edema caused by an I.-amino acid oxidase (LAAO). The Hyal-Ba cDNA sequence (2020 bp) encodes 449 amino acid residues, including the catalytic site residues (Glu135, Asp133, Tyr206, Tyr253 and Trp328) and three functional motifs for N-linked glycosylation, which are conserved with other snake hyaluronidases. Spatial modeling of Hyal-Ba displayed a TIM-Barrel (alpha/beta) fold and an EGF-like domain in the C-terminal portion. The phylogenetic analysis of Hyal-Ba with other homologous Hyals showed the monophyly of viperids. Further, Hyal-Ba studies may extend our knowledge of B. atrox toxinology and provides insight to improve the neutralizing strategies of therapeutic antivenoms.

AB Auranofin is a gold (1)-containing compound used for the treatment of rheumatic arthritis. Auranofin has anticancer activity in animal models and is approved for clinical trials for lung and ovarian carcinomas. Both the cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of the selenoprotein thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) are well documented targets of auranofin. Auranofin was recently reported to also inhibit proteasome activity at the level of the proteasome-associated deubiquitinases (DUBs) UCHL5 and USP14. We here set out to re-examine the molecular mechanism underlying auranofin cytotoxicity towards cultured cancer cells. The effects of auranofin on the proteasome were examined in cells and in vitro, effects on DUB activity were assessed using different substrates. The cellular response to auranofin was compared to that of the 20S proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the 19S DUB inhibitor b-AP15 using proteomics. Auranofin was found to inhibit mitochondrial activity and to an induce oxidative stress response at IC50 doses. At 2-3-fold higher doses, auranofin inhibits proteasome processing in cells. At such supra-pharmacological concentrations USP14 activity was inhibited. Analysis of protein expression profiles in drug-exposed tumor cells showed that auranofin induces a response distinct from that of the 20S proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the DUB inhibitor b-AP15, both of which induced similar responses. Our results support the notion that the primary mechanism of action of auranofin is TrxR inhibition and suggest that proteasome DUB inhibition is an off-target effect. Whether proteasome inhibition will contribute to the antineoplastic effect of auranofin in treated patients is unclear but remains a possibility.

AB The homeoprotein Msx1 plays a critical role in embryonic patterning, particularly to maintain myogenic progenitor cell fate. However, the mechanisms underlying Msx1-mediated inhibition of myogenesis remain largely unknown. Here, we show that Msx1 cooperates with the protein kinase C-related kinase 1 (Pkn1), a member of the protein kinase C-related kinase family, to prevent the terminal differentiation of myogenic precursor cells. In mouse C2C12 cells, Pkn1 knockout partly impaired Msx1-mediated inhibition of myogenic differentiation, indicating a role for Pkn1 in this process. Furthermore, we found that Pkn1 was required for Msx1 enrichment at the promoter of Myf5, a myogenic regulatory gene. In Pkn1 knockout cells, this reduced Msx1 enrichment at the Myf5 promoter coincided with attenuated repression of Myf5 transcription. Together with our observation that Msx1 and Pkn1 were associated in a protein complex, these findings strongly suggest that Msx1 cooperates with Pkn1 to down-regulate Myf5 and, therefore, prevent the differentiation of myogenic precursor cells. Collectively, our data provide key insights into the mechanisms underlying Msx1 function in the prevention of myogenic differentiation.

AB Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) from non-enzymatic glycation are implicated in several degenerative diseases, including being a crucial contributor in secondary complications of diabetes. This has garnered significant scientific interest in inhibiting agents of AGEs to prevent and remediate disorders arising due to glycation. In the current study, inhibitory effects on AGEs formation were investigated using bio-enzymatically synthesized nanoformulations of gold (AuNPs) and silver (AgNPs) by physiologically important enzyme, beta galactosidase. Human serum albumin, most abundant protein in human blood plasma, was glycated by incubating with glucose leading to AGEs formation. The AGEs formation was significantly minimized with both AuNPs and AgNPs, as confirmed by various biophysical and biochemical techniques. Circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy further affirmed antiglycation potential of AuNPs and AgNPs. The results were corroborated with thiol group, free lysine and carbonyl content estimation for native, glycated and nanoparticles (NPs) treated samples. Confocal microscopic imaging was performed to exhibit glycation inhibiting potential of the NPs. The inhibition of AGEs was observed to be slightly stronger in case of AgNPs than AuNPs with both exhibiting promising results as potential anti-glycating agents. The study sheds light on potential of non-toxic NPs being utilized as controlling agents against hyperglycemic conditions and diabetes management.

AB Lysin 2638aR and chimeric Ply187AN-KSH3b fusion protein are capable of lysing antibiotic-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and are promising alternatives to antibiotics. Studies on the stability and structure of lysins 2638aR and Ply187AN-KSH3b are important for assessing the feasibility of their practical use. Both lysins are highly active at physiological pH (7.5) and at low salt content (the concentration of NaCl in the reaction medium is not more than 250 mM). Lysins are inactivated by a monomolecular mechanism and have high stability at 4 degrees C (storage temperature). The maximum value of the half-inactivation time for lysin 2638aR is 190-200 days (500-1000 mM NaCl, pH 6.0-7.5), for lysin Ply187AN-KSH3b is 320-340 days (10-1000 mM NaCl, pH 6.0). The lysins are pretty stable in human blood serum (the half-inactivation time is 0.5-2 h) at 37 degrees C. The lysins undergo denaturation in large part due to the destruction of the alpha-helices at temperatures above 40 degrees C.

AB Glucose is a preferred metabolite in most mammalian cells, and proper regulation of uptake is critical for organism homeostasis. The glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) is responsible for glucose uptake in a wide variety of cells and appears to be regulated in a tissue specific manner. Therefore, a better understanding of GLUT1 regulation within its various cellular environments is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to treat disorders associated with glucose homeostasis. Previous findings suggest that plasma membrane subdomains called lipid rafts may play a role in regulation of GLUT1 uptake activity. While studying this phenomenon in L929 mouse fibroblast cells, we observed that GLUT1 associates with a low density lipid microdomain distinct from traditionally-defined lipid rafts. These structures are not altered by cholesterol removal with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin and lack resistance to cold Triton X-100 extraction. Our data indicate that the GLUT1-containing membrane microdomains in L929 cells, as well as GLUT1's basal activity, are instead sphingolipid-dependent, being sensitive to both myriocin and sphingomyeli-nase treatment. These microdomains appear to be organized primarily by their lipid composition, as disruption of the actin cytoskeleton or microtubules does not alter the association of GLUT1 with them. Furthermore, the association of GLUT1 with these microdomains appears not to require palmitoylation or glycosylation, as pharmacologic inhibition of these processes had no impact on GLUT1 density in membrane fractions. Importantly, we find no evidence that GLUT1 is actively translocated into or out of low density membrane fractions in response to acute activation in L929 cell.

AB There is a growing need for research on new antimalarial agents against Plasmodium falciparum infection, especially in regards to planning molecular architecture for specific molecular targets of the parasite. Thus, a metalloprotease from Bothrops moojeni, known as BmooMP alpha-I, was explored in this study, through in silico assays, aiming at the development of a peptide generated from this molecule with potential inhibitory action on PfPNP, an enzyme necessary for the survival of the parasite. In order to isolate BmooMP alpha-I, cation exchange and reverse phase chromatographies were performed, followed by in vitro assays of antiparasitic activity against the W2 strain of P. falciparum. The interactions between BmooMP alpha-I and PfPNP were evaluated via docking, and the resulting peptide, described as Pep1 BM, was selected according to the BmooMP alpha-I region demonstrating the best interaction score with the target of interest. The values for the specific activities of the PfPNP reaction were measured using the inorganic phosphate substrate and MESG. The fraction corresponding to BmooMP alpha-I was identified as fraction 4 in the cation exchange chromatography step, due to proteolytic activity on casein and the presence of a major band at congruent to 23 kDa. BmooMP alpha-I was able to inhibit in vitro growth of W2 P. falciparum, with an IC50 value of 16.14 mu g/mL. Virtual screening with Pep1 BM demonstrated two PfPNP target binding regions, with Delta G values at the interaction interface of -10.75 kcal/mol and -11.74 kcal/mol. A significant reduction in the enzymatic activity of PfPNP was observed in the presence of Pep 1 BM when compared to the assay in the absence of this possible inhibitor. BmooMP alpha-I showed activity in vitro against W2 P. falciparum. By means of in silico techniques, the Pep 1 BM was identified as having potential binding affinity to the catalytic site of PfPNP and of inhibiting its catalytic activity in vitro.

AB Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous group of breast cancer with one common feature: distinctly metastatic nature with higher rate of relapse and shorter survival compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is highly associated with cancer metastasis. Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), the most abundant anthocyanin pigment enriched in fresh fruits and vegetables, showed ideal anti-oxidant property. C3G could also inhibit certain malignant behaviors of cancer cells, however, whether repression of EMT was involved in its anti-cancer especially TNBC effect remains unknown. Herein, we report that C3G decreases the migratory and invasive nature of TNBC lines MDA-MB-231 and BT-549. Mechanistically, C3G induces reversion of EMT characterized by phenotype modulation with increased epithelial marker E-ca and 20-1, decreased mesenchymal marker Vimentin, N-ca and EMT-associated transcription factors Snail1, Snail2. NF-kappa B is pivotal for EMT and Sirt1 is a NF-kappa B inhibitor. We show that NF-K kappa is attenuated and Sirt1 is induced by C3G in TNBC, respectively. And later evidence demonstrates that abrogation of Sirt1 with small interfering RNA transfection abolished NF-kappa B inhibition and EMT reversion by C3G. Subsequently, we show that microRNA-138(miR-138) represses Sirt1 via mRNA translation inhibition and is inhibited by C3G. Moreover, miR-138 repression is involved in Sirt1 re-activation and migratory and invasive inhibition of TNBC by C3G. Taken together, we supplied more evidence to the anti-breast cancer mechanisms of C3G. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Cell cycle-related and expression elevated protein in tumor (CREPT) is emerging as a novel cancer-related gene that is dysregulated in many kinds of malignancies. However, the expression and biological role of CREPT in glioma remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to explore the potential function and regulation mechanism of CREPT in glioma. Results showed that CRETP expression was significantly upregulated in glioma cell lines. Depletion of CREPT by siRNA-mediated gene silencing markedly decreased the proliferative and invasive capabilities of glioma cells. Bioinformatics analysis predicted CREPT as a target gene of microRNA-596 (miR-596), which was further verified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. miR-596 was significantly decreased in glioma tissues and cell lines, and inversely correlated with CREPT expression in clinical specimens. Knockdown of CREPT or overexpression of miR-596 significantly restricted the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in glioma cells. Moreover, overexpression of CREPT partially reversed the miR-596-mediated inhibitory effect on proliferation, invasion and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in glioma cells. Overall, these results demonstrate that CREPT exerts an oncogenic role in glioma and its expression is regulated by miR-596. Our study highlights the important role miR-596/CREPT/Wnt/beta-catenin signaling axis may play in glioma. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB Both hyperuricemia and adipose tissue renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are closely associated with multiple metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. We previously reported that uric acid could upregulate tissue RAS in adipocytes. In the present study, we aimed to reveal the involvement of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in uric acid-induced RAS activation in adipose tissue. A hyperuricemia rat model fed with a high-fructose diet and rat primary adipocytes were used in this study. Here, we inhibited TLR2 and TLR4 expression in adipose tissue and cultured adipocytes using small interfering RNA (siRNA). We found that high fructose-fed rats had hyperuricemia, higher body weight and greater adipose tissue content. We also found that hyperuricemia rats had raising blood pressure, higher expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and RAS components in adipose tissue, which could be prevented by TLR2/4-siRNA infection. In vitro study, uric acid caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in the mRNA expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in rat adipocytes. Uric acid could increase inflammatory cytokines and upregulate tissue RAS in rat adipocytes, which were both blocked with TLR2/4-siRNA infection. TNF-alpha and IL-6 could also result in an activation of tissue RAS expression in adipocytes. In conclusion, TLR2/4 mediated adipose inflammation plays a key role in RAS activation induced by uric acid in adipose tissue.

AB Cisplatin resistance has been long considered an obstacle to the efficacy of chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) have been widely reported to participate in the various biological process including cancer. In the present study, we aim to explore the functions of Linc00221 and miR-519a in the sensitivity and the resistance of NSCLC to cisplatin. The levels of Linc00221, miR-519a, and zinc finger and BTB domain-containing five (ZBTB5) in NSCLC tissues were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Colony formation and MIT assays were applied to detect the viability of cells after cisplatin treatment. Dual luciferase reporter assays were used to detect the inhibitory effect of miR-519a on ZBTB5 and Linc00221, and pull down experiments were employed to determine the direct interaction between Linc00221 and miR-519a. Our results showed that Linc00221 was highly expressed in cisplatin-resistant NSCLC tissues and cells and closely associated with poor prognosis. Linc00221 promoted the cisplatin resistance of NSCLC and miR-519a was a direct target of Linc00221. In addition, miR-519a could promote cisplatin sensitivity in NSCLC cells by targeting ZBTB5. Linc00221 could mediate the cisplatin sensitivity in NSCLC by adsorbing miR-519a to prevent its down-regulation of ZBTB5. In conclusion, Linc00221 promotes cisplatin resistance in NSCLC through the downstream miR-519a/ZBTB5 signaling axis, which could be used as a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for clinical cisplatin-resistant NSCLC patients.

AB RyhB is a key regulator of iron level in Escherichia coli (E. coli), which assists in conserving iron for life-sustaining cellular functions when cytoplasmic levels of the ferrous form of iron is limited. RyhB affects glucose metabolism. Seventy percent of the genes that are regulated by RyhB are related to metabolism. We demonstrated for the first time that the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway increased upon ryhB activation using a C-13 stable isotope-based technique called METAFoR (Metabolic flux ratio analysis). U-C-13 glucose-based studies showed that the reversible exchange activity of serine and glycine was enhanced by flux redistribution, which further favors NADPH formation. In addition, Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway activity was inhibited in the ryhB-defective cells. Quantitative physiology-based experiments highlighted a significant increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in ryhB-induced W3100 E. coli cells in batch culture. A simultaneous decrease in NADH/NAD(+) and NADPH/NADP(+) ratios outlined the potentially direct roles of NADH and NADPH in antagonizing the excess ROS formed after ryhB activation. Our observations offer a new perspective regarding the roles of RyhB and highlight that this small RNA can significantly affect cell metabolism in addition to its role as a regulator of gene expression.

AB The aim of the present work was to establish the thermodynamic and functional differences in the proteinprotein interactions between the components of the P450-dependent mitochondrial (mit) and microsomal (mic) monooxygenase systems using 12 different isoforms of cytochromes P450 and two redox partners, NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) and adrenodoxin (Adx). Comparative analysis of the affinity, thermodynamics, enzymatic activity and the ability for one-electron reduction has been carried out. The study of protein-protein interactions to determine the equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) was performed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor Biacore 3000. We demonstrated that CPR and Adx interacted with both, micCYPs and mitCYPs, with different affinities (Kd values ranged from 0.01 to 2 mu M). All complexes of microsomal (micCYP) and mitochondrial (mitCYP) cytochrome P450 with redox partners can be divided into three groups depending on the prevalent role of either enthalpy or entropy contribution. About 90% of CYP/redox partner complexes were entropy-driven, while the contribution of enthalpy and entropy differed significantly in case of mitCYP/Adx complexes. The CYP11A1/Adx complex was enthalpy-driven, while CYP11B1/Adx and CYP1162/Adx complexes were entropy-driven. Thermodynamic discrimination of mitCYPs/Adx complexes is likely associated with the different functional impact ofCYP11A1 and CYP11B. The exception was the enthalpy-entropy-driven (mixed type) CYP21A2/Adx complex. CPR and Adx were able to transfer the first electron to micCYPs while mitCYPs demonstrated high specificity to Adx. Productive catalysis for mitCYPs observed only in the presence of Adx/AdR pair, while in case of steroidogenic micCYPs (CYP17A1, CYP19A1, and CYP21A2) it was found either in the presence of a CPR or an Adx/AdR pair. From the evolutionary point of view, the type 1 electron transport system (mitCYPs, Adx and NADPHdependent adrenodoxin reductase (AdR)) increased the specialization of protein-protein interactions (PPI) significantly, which was accompanied by an increase in the specificity of electron transfer. In contrast, the evolution of the type 2 electron transport system (micCYPs and CPR) led to an increase in versatility of PPI as demonstrated for steroidogenic microsomal cytochrome P450s. Our data enhance the current understanding of molecular recognition and summarize qualitative and thermodynamic characteristics of protein-protein interactions in the P450-dependent mitochondrial and microsomal monooxygenase systems.

AB Flavonoids are antioxidants known to be abundant in edible plants. Seven 5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxy substituted flavonoids representing each major flavonoid class were used as cytochrome c reductants to systematically investigate the redox role of their C-rings. Additional examples of flavonoids and benzenediols were investigated to better understand the role of the B-ring. Pseudo-first order rate constants (k(obs)) and apparent bimolecular rate constants (k(app)) values were calculated from spectroscopic measurements. Of the seven flavonoids tested, five yielded measurable observed reduction rate constants. Butein (a chalcone) had the highest apparent bimolecular rate constant (k(app)), followed by taxifolin (a flavanonol), catechin (a flavanol), eriodictyol (a flavanone), and luteolin (a flavone). Quercetin (a flavonol) and cyanidin (an anthocyanidin), however, reduced cytochrome c but k(app) rate constants were unable to be calculated. Neither this trend nor trends in observed rate constants correlated with flavonoid pK(a), solvent accessible surface area, polar surface area, reduction potential, antioxidant ability, resonance, or radical scavenging efficiency. Weak correlation, however, was found with degrees of freedom and the number of redox involved electrons. While some cytochrome c reduction rates have been reported, this study is the first to systematically investigate the role of the structure of the flavonoid C-ring across a full set of flavonoids with identical B-rings.

AB Palmatine is a natural isoquinoline alkaloid and has been widely used in pharmaceutical field. The purpose of this review is to provide the latest and comprehensive information on the pharmacology, toxicity and pharmacokinetics of palmatine in the past, to explore the therapeutic potential of this compound and look for ways to reduce toxicity. Information on palmatine was collected from the internet database PubMed, Elsevier, ResearchGate, Web of Science, Wiley Online Library and Europe PMC using a combination of keywords including "pharmacology", "toxicology", "pharmacokinetics". All studies of this genus were included in this review until March 2019. Palmatine has a wide spectrum of pharmacological effects, including anti-cancer, anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotection, anti-bacterial, anti-viral and regulating blood lipids. However, palmatine has obvious DNA toxicity, and has a complex effect on metabolic enzymes in the liver. Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that glucuronidation and sulfation are the main metabolic pathways of palmatine. Palmatine can be used in many diseases. Future research directions include: how the concentration of palmatine affects pharmacological effects and toxicity; the mechanism of synergy between palmatine and other protoberberine alkaloid; Structural modification of palmatine is one of the key methods to enhance pharmacological activity and reduce activity.

AB Flavonoids like quercetin and myricetin serve as naturally occurring antioxidants but their bioactivity is limited due to low aqueous solubility and oxidation under physiological conditions. In this current study, the antioxidant activity of quercetin and myricetin loaded chitosan nanoparticles during the induced oxidation of Ribonuclease A (RNase A) has been compared with the corresponding free flavonoids. Oxidation of RNase A leads to intermolecular dityrosine (DT) bond formation which shows a characteristic fluorescence emission around 405 nm. Although both quercetin and myricetin loaded nanoparticles initially exhibit lower antioxidant property compared to the free flavonoids, however, with increase in oxidant concentration over time the DT fluorescence showed greater increase for free flavonoids in comparison to the nanoparticles. The polyphenol loaded nanoparticles are also found to be effective in preventing bacterial cell damage in oxidizing medium. The slow release of flavonoids from the nanoparticles is responsible for their prolonged antioxidant effect in the oxidizing medium unlike the free flavonoids which are exhausted almost completely in the initial phase.

AB Malignant melanoma remains a challenge for clinical practice and novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Herbacetin, a natural flavonoid compound that has multiple pharmacological activities, exerts anticancer effects on several human tumors. In this study, the anti-angiogenesis effect of Herbacetin in human malignant melanoma was investigated. The results indicated that Herbacetin treatment significantly suppressed tumor growth and angiogenesis of malignant melanoma both in vitro and in vivo. In melanoma A375 and Hs294T cells, Herbacetin treatment suppressed both EGF-induced and constitutive phosphorylation of EGFR, accelerated the internalization and degradation of EGFR, and subsequently suppressed the activation of the downstream kinases (AKT and ERK). Moreover, MMP9 was determined as a key angiogenic factor in Herbacetin treated melanoma cells. Knockdown of MMP9 suppressed the in vitro angiogenesis while overexpression of MMP9 in Herbacetin treated melanoma cells restored the angiogenesis ability.

AB Our group showed that repetitive dose of potassium iodide (KI) for eight days offers an efficient protection for exposure to repeated radioactive emissions without adverse effects on adult rats. However, differential expression of genes implicated in Wolff-Chaikoff effect was observed. To understand the Wolff-Chaikoff regulation and its molecular constituents during repetitive administration of KI, a biochemical reaction network was constructed as a "geographical" map of the thyrocyte depicting iodide and thyroid hormone synthesis. Path analysis of the network has been performed to investigate the presence of a regulatory circuit of the node iodide to the node "nis transcription". NIS is responsible for the uptake of KI and plays an important role in the Wolff-Chaikoff effect. The map is a source for the most updated information about iodide and thyroid hormone metabolism. Based on this map, we propose a hypothesis that shows a putative mechanism behind NIS regulation and KI uptake. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Analogs of benzothiazole orange (BO) with one, two or three methylbenzothiazolylmethylidene substituents in the 1-methylpyridinium ring were obtained from the respective picolinium, lutidinium or collidinium salts. Fluorescence parameters of the known and new dyes in complexes with various DNA structures, including G-quadruplexes (G4s) and i-motifs (IMs), were analyzed. All dyes efficiently distinguished G4s and ss-DNA. The bi- and tri-substituted derivatives had basically similar distributions of relative fluorescence intensities. The mono-substituted derivatives exhibited enhanced sensitivity to parallel G4s. All dyes were particularly sensitive to a G4 structure with an additional duplex module (the thrombin-binding aptamer TBA31), presumably due to a distinctive binding mode (interaction with the junction between the two modules). In particular, BO showed a strong (160-fold) enhancement in fluorescence quantum yield in complex with TBA31 compared to the free dye. The fluorescence quantum yields of the 2,4-bisubstituted derivative in complex with well-characterized G4s from oncogene promoters were in the range of 0.04-0.28, i.e. comparable to those of ThT. The mono/bi-substituted derivatives should be considered as possible light-up probes for G4 formation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a component of the outer structure of cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, could induce apoptosis in the intestinal endocrine cell line STC-1. However, the signaling cascades involved in this process have not been elucidated. Hence, we investigated the mechanism of cell apoptosis and hyposecretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) induced by LPS in the GLUTag enteroendocrine cell line. LPS decreased the cell viability of GLUTag cells, up-regulated the TNF-alpha level, induced the apoptosis and down-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of GLP-1. In addition, TNF-alpha promoted LPS-induced apoptosis of GLUTag cells through mediating the formation of the RIP1/RIP3 necrosome. RIP1 and RIP3 knockdown increased cell viability, the mRNA and protein levels of GLP-1 and the mTOR signaling pathway-related proteins (p-mTOR and p-S6), and decreased the relative caspase 3/7 activity, cell apoptosis and ROS production. Further studies showed that ROS inhibited the mTOR signaling pathway. Moreover, the antioxidant N-acetyl-t-cysteine increased cell viability, GLP-1 expressions and the mTOR signaling pathway-related proteins, and inhibited the ROS production. However, the mTOR specific inhibitor (Rapa) reversed all these above effects. Taken together, our result revealed that LPS induced the apoptosis of GLUTag cells and GLP-1 hyposecretion through the RIP/ROS/mTOR pathway. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Serotonin (5-hydroxytriptamine; 5-HT) is a fascinating neurotransmitter that thanks to an extensive axonal network is released throughout the entire central nervous system (CNS) and exerts its action on the modulation of a countless number of physiological, behavioral and cognitive processes. In addition, cumulating evidences have linked alteration in 5-HT neurotransmission with the onset of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as depression, autisms and schizophrenia. Nevertheless only 5% of the total body content of serotonin exerts its action in the CNS, while the rest is synthetized and stored in peripheral tissues where it acts as an autacoid.
   In 2003 it became evident that two distinct isoforms of tryptophan hydroxylase (Tph), the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of serotonin, are selectively expressed in peripheral tissues and in the CNS, with Tph2 as the brain specific isoform.
   In the present review we describe how the discovery of Tph2 has improved our understanding on the role of serotonergic neurotransmission. We mainly focus on the analysis of animal models generated by genetic manipulation of Tph2, in which the synthesis of brain serotonin was either reduced or disrupted. The consequences of an altered serotonergic neurotransmission on brain development, as well as on physiological and behavioral processes will be assessed. Finally, we report on several association studies that have linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human TPH2 gene with behavioral disturbances and neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB Virtually all brain circuits are physically embedded in a three-dimensional matrix of fibers that release 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin). The density of this matrix varies across brain regions and cortical laminae, and it is altered in some mental disorders, including Major Depressive Disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorder. We investigate how the regional structure of the serotonergic matrix depends on the stochastic behavior of individual serotonergic fibers and introduce a new framework for the quantitative analysis of this behavior. In particular, we show that a step-wise random walk, based on the von Mises-Fisher probability distribution, can provide a realistic and mathematically concise description of these fibers. We also consider other stochastic models, including the fractional Brownian motion. The proposed approach seeks to advance the current understanding of the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) and may also support future theory-guided therapeutic approaches.

AB Membrane receptors often form complexes with other membrane proteins that directly interact with different effectors of the signal transduction machinery. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) were for long time considered as single pharmacological entities. However, evidence for oligomerization appeared for various classes and subtypes of GPCRs. This review focuses on metabotropic serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptors, which belong to the rhodopsin-like class A of GPCRs, and will summarize the convergent evidence that homo- and hetero-dimers containing 5-HT receptors exist in transfected cells and in-vivo. We will show that complexes involving 5-HT receptors may acquire new signal transduction pathways and new physiological roles. In some cases, these complexes participate in disease-specific deregulations, that can be differentially affected by various drugs. Hence, selecting receptor complex-specific responses of these heterodimers may constitute an emerging strategy likely to improve beneficial therapeutic effects.

AB The 5-HT1A receptor is highly expressed both in 5-HT neurons as a presynaptic inhibitory autoreceptor, and in many brain regions innervated by 5-HT as a post-synaptic heteroreceptor. This review examines the signaling of 5-HT1A receptors to regulate 5-HT activity and behavior. Initial findings in heterologous cell systems, neuronal cell lines, neurons, and in vivo show that the 5-HT1A receptor is a Gi/o-coupled receptor that signals to the canonical pathway of inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC). However, new neuron-specific pathways and their roles in neuronal function have been uncovered. 5-HT1A receptor coupling via G beta gamma subunits reduces neuronal activity by opening potassium channels and closing calcium channels. However, the receptor coupled primarily to Gi3 in 5-HT neurons and Gil in hippocampal neurons, which may underlie differential signaling and desensitization in these cells. While in 5-HT neurons, the 5-HT1A receptor appears to inhibit extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) ERK1/2 activity, it signals to activate it in developing and adult hippocampal neurons, and may play roles in synaptogenesis. Recent studies implicate 5-HT1A signaling through G beta gamma and tyrosine kinase receptors to activate ACII, phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC), calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII), and phosphatidyl inositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling mediating synaptogenesis, cell survival, and behavioral actions of antidepressants. Thus, the 5-HT1A receptor appears to modify its signaling repertoire depending on the cell type (5-HT vs. post-synaptic neurons) and the developmental state of the neuron. Enhancement of cell specific signaling of the 5-HT1A receptor may provide an amplification of the antidepressant actions of 5-HT1A receptor activation. In addition, in response to prolonged 5-HT elevation upon chronic antidepressant treatment, the 5-HT1A autoreceptor appears to desensitize more extensively than the heteroreceptor. The mechanisms of 5-HT1A receptor desensitization are discussed, highlighting the potential of enhancing autoreceptor desensitization to accelerate antidepressant response.

AB Besides its classical functions as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, local mediator in the gastrointestinal tract and vasoactive agent in the blood, serotonin has more recently emerged as a growth factor for human tumor cells of different origins (carcinomas, glioma and carcinoids). Several data are also available on serotonin involvement in cancer cell migration, metastatic dissemination and tumor angiogenesis. The serotonin-induced signaling pathways that promote tumor progression are complex and only partly understood in some cancer types. The results of several studies showed that serotonin levels in the tumor played a crucial role in cancer progression. A serotonin production and secretion by neuroendocrine cells have been shown in the progression of several solid tumors and the involvement of a serotoninergic autocrine loop was proposed. Specific receptor subtypes are associated with different fundamental stages of tumor progression and the pattern of receptors expression becomes dysregulated in several human tumors when compared with normal cells or tissues. Serotonin receptors, selective serotonin transporter and serotonin synthesis pathways are potential chemotherapeutic targets for the treatment of several cancers in which therapeutic approaches are limited. Through several asked questions, this critical mini-review discusses the relevance of the involvement of serotonin in human cancer progression.

The detection of vesicular monoamine transporter and serotonin receptors in several retinal cells confirm that 5-HT is playing a neuromodulatory role in this structure. Whereas signaling pathways activated by 5-HT receptor binding has been poorly investigated so far, numerous data demonstrated that 5-HT is involved in retinal physiology, retinal physiopathology and photoreceptor survival.

AB Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) once most extensively studied as a neurotransmitter of the central nervous system, is seen to be predominantly secreted in the gut. About 95% of 5-HT is estimated to be found in gut mainly within the enterochromaffin cells whereas about 5% is found in the brain. 5-HT is an important enteric signaling molecule and is well known for playing a key role in sensory-motor and secretory functions in the gut. In recent times, studies uncovering various new functions of gut-derived 5-HT indicate that many more are yet to be discovered in coming days. Recent studies revealed that 5-HT plays a pivotal role in immune cell activation and generation/perpetuation of inflammation in the gut. In addition to its various roles in the gut, there are now emerging evidences that suggest an important role of gut-derived 5-HT in other biological processes beyond the gut, such as bone remodeling and metabolic homeostasis. This review focuses to briefly summarize the accumulated and newly updated role of 5-HT in the maintenance of normal gut physiology and in the pathogenesis of inflammation in the gut. The collected information about this multifaceted signaling molecule may aid in distinguishing its good and bad effects which may lead to the development of novel strategies to overcome the unwanted effect, such as in inflammatory bowel disease.

AB Genetic and pharmacological studies provided evidence that serotonin (5-HT) is an important signaling molecule for the development and the maintenance of mineralized tissues. However, how 5-HT takes part to the homeostasis of teeth and bone remains elusive. In the dental field, a major breakthrough comes from the identification of 5-HT but also dopamine (DA) as "damage" signals necessary for stem cell-based tooth repair. Pulpal stem cells express the overall functions of 5-HT and DA neurons including a definite set of functional 5-HT/DA receptors that render cells responsive for circulating bioamines. Upon tooth injury, activated platelets release bulks of 5-HT/DA that mobilize pulpal stem cells for natural dental repair. The contribution of 5-HT to bone metabolism is more documented with description of both anabolic and resorptive effects. By controlling the tissue-non specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), 5-HT2B receptors exert an anabolic function and a pivotal role in mineralization processes. Increasing our understanding of the role of 5-HT receptors in bone metabolism may pave the road for the development of therapeutic strategies towards skeletal-associated pathologies and ectopic calcification.

AB Peripheral serotonin continuously reveals its unexpected involvements in many organ functions. In bone tissue, there is an increasing evidence for a local serotonergic system affecting the cellular and molecular actors involved in bone turnover. During orthodontic treatment, tooth movement relies on bone remodeling, itself a result of the inflammatory process triggered by application of orthodontic forces to the teeth. Nowadays, many adults proceed to an orthodontic treatment, it therefore seems important to consider physiological growth-related factors and external factors as medications that may influence adverse effects and efficacy of orthodontic treatment techniques. In this review, we focus on peripheral serotonin mechanism of regulation of bone remodeling during orthodontic movement. We discuss the differential effect of serotonin on alveolar bone inflammation that may open new strategies in orthodontics.

AB Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is a complex disorder of human pregnancy that leads to poor health outcomes in offspring. These range from immediate risks such as perinatal morbidity and stillbirths, to long-term complications including severe neurodevelopmental problems. Despite its relatively high global prevalence, the aetiology of FGR and its complications is not currently well understood. We now know that serotonin (5-HT) is synthesised in the placenta and is crucial for early fetal forebrain development in mice. However, the contribution of a disrupted placental 5-HT synthetic pathway to the pathophysiology of placental insufficiency in FGR and its significant fetal neurodevelopmental complications are unclear.

AB We have reviewed the scientific literature related to four diseases in which to serotonin (5-HT) is involved in the etiology, herein named 5-HT-linked diseases, and whose prevalence is influenced by estrogenic status: depression, migraine, irritable bowel syndrome and eating disorders. These diseases all have in common a sex-dimorphic prevalence, with women more frequently affected than men. The co-occurrence between these 5-HT-linked diseases suggests that they have common physiopathological mechanisms. In most 5-HT-linked diseases (except for anorexia nervosa and irritable bowel syndrome), a decrease in the serotonergic tone is observed and estrogens are thought to contribute to the improvement of symptoms by stimulating the serotonergic system. Human pregnancy is characterized by a unique 5-HT and estrogen synthesis by the placenta. Pregnancy-specific disorders, such as hyperemesis gravidarum, gestational diabetes mellitus and pre-eclampsia, are associated with a hyperserotonergic state and decreased estrogen levels. Fetal programming of 5-HT-linked diseases is a complex phenomenon that involves notably fetal-sex differences, which suggest the implication of sex steroids. From a mechanistic point of view, we hypothesize that estrogens regulate the serotonergic system, resulting in a protective effect against 5-HT-linked diseases, but that, in turn, 5-HT affects estrogen synthesis in an attempt to retrieve homeostasis. These two processes (5-HT and estrogen biosynthesis) are crucial for successful pregnancy outcomes, and thus, a disruption of this 5-HT-estrogen relationship may explain pregnancy-specific pathologies or pregnancy complications associated with 5-HT-linked diseases.

AB The redox homeostasis of cytoplasm is maintained by a series of disulfide exchange reactions mediated by proteins belonging to the thioredoxin superfamily. Thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase, being the major members of the family, play a key role in oxidative stress response of Staphylococcus aureus. In this report, we have identified and characterised an active thioredoxin system of the mentioned pathogen. Crystal structure of thioredoxin2 (SaTrx2) in its reduced form reveals that it contains the conserved redox active WCXXC motif and a thioredoxin fold. Thioredoxin reductase2 (SaTR2) is a flavoprotein and consists of two Rossmann folds as the binding sites for FAD and NADPH. Crystal structure of the SaTR2 holoenzyme shows that the protein consists of two domains and the catalytic site comprises of an intramolecular disulfide bond formed between two sequentially distal cysteine residues. Biophysical and biochemical studies unveil that SaTrx2 and SaTR2 can physically interact in solution and in the course of sustaining the redox equilibrium, the latter reduces the former. Molecular docking has been performed to illustrate the interface formed between SaTrx2 and SaTR2 during the disulfide exchange reaction.

AB Tri cluster is responsible for the biosynthesis of trichothecenes in Trichoderma spp. Tri6 gene present within the cluster encodes for a transcriptional regulator and is vital for the expression of all other tri genes of the cluster. Tri6 encodes for a 218-amino-acid residues long protein which contains three zinc finger motifs. Tri6 is able to regulate and bind within the GTGA/TCAC promoter region of tri genes. Here we highlight the binding of tri6 with the regulatory DNA element present at the upstream of tri3 gene and effect of two quorum-sensing molecules tyrosol and farnesol on its binding. Analysis showed that tyrosol binds at sequence GTGA/TCAC specific for tri6 binding and thus do not allow tri6 to bind on promoter region. Interactions of tyrosol with zinc finger motif of tri6 protein also resulted in structural changes making tri6 unsuitable for binding with the regulatory DNA element of tri3 gene promoter resulting in downregulation of the gene. Structural changes also resulted in loss of zinc from zinc finger 2 motif. In contrast to the tyrosol, tri6-DNA complex could easily accommodate farnesol molecule without showing any interference with the functional conformation of the tri6-DNA complex. Therefore, tri gene expression seems not to be negatively regulated by the farnesol. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM). All rights reserved.

AB A Mg2+-water bridge between the C-3, C-4 diketo moiety of fluoroquinolones and the conserved amino acid residues in the GyrA/ParC subunit is critical for the binding of a fluoroquinolone to a topoisomerase-DNA covalent complex. The fluoroquinolone UING-5-249 (249) can bind to the GyrB subunit through its C7-aminomethylpyrrolidine group. This interaction is responsible for enhanced activities of 249 against the wild type and quinolone-resistant mutant topoisomerases. To further evaluate the effects of the 249-GyrB interaction on fluoroquinolone activity, we examined the activities of decarboxy- and thio-249 against DNA gyrase and conducted docking studies using the structure of a gyrase-ciprofloxacin-DNA ternary complex. We found that the 249-GyrB interaction rescued the activity of thio-249 but not that of decarboxy-249. A C7-group that binds more strongly to the GyrB subunit may allow for modifications at the C-4 position, leading to a novel compound that is active against the wild type and quinolone-resistant pathogens.

AB Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the main locomotor disorders in horses. Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first-line treatment for OA, opioids could also be used. In previous studies, opioids showed promising anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of two opioids (morphine and methadone) against inflammation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated synoviocytes by analyzing microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) expression. Synoviocytes were obtained from the joints at the distal limbs of dead animals. The cytotoxic effects of LPS, morphine, and methadone were investigated by using a cell viability assay with crystal violet dye. Synoviocytes were treated with LPS, LPS plus morphine, or LPS plus methadone for 3, 6, and 12 h, and mPGES-1 and PTGS2 expression was measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction. LPS, and morphine did not affect the viability of synoviocytes, even at high concentrations. LPS treatment increased mPGES-1 and PTGS2 expression, whereas morphine inhibited the increase in mPGES-1 and PTGS2 expression in LPS-stimulated synoviocytes. Methadone did not inhibit mPGES-1 or PTGS2 expression. These results suggest that morphine may exhibit anti-inflammatory effect; therefore, it might be beneficial for the treatment of OA.

AB Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) is the key enzyme involved in thyroid hormone synthesis. Autoantibodies to TPO (TPOAbs) are a hallmark of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). Here, we highlight recent progress over several years in understanding TPO biochemistry and function in various pathologies. TPO undergoes complex post-translational modifications as a dimer in endoplasmic reticulum during secretory pathway to apical membrane of thyrocytes. In silico modelling of TPO dimer has provided new information into the two enzyme active site regions and autoantigenic determinants. TPO and hydrogen peroxide generating DUOX and caveolin-1 form a complex known as thyroxisome to bring together in close proximity the components of hormone synthesis in apical membrane. Autoimmunity to TPO is characterised by autoantibodies and T cell reactivity in Hashimoto's disease and Graves' disease. TPOAbs are directed predominantly to two immunodominant determinants (IDR) termed IDR-A and IDR-B regions, with the latter antibodies more predominant in autoimmune disease. Strong genetic risk has been shown to be associated with TPOAbs for AITD development. A different antibody with unusual features of bispecificity for both TPO and thyroglobulin may play protective role in Hashimoto's disease. In the context of TPO biology in human cancer, thyroid tumor tissue and breast cancer differ in TPO expression and isoform composition. In thyroid cancer, TPO expression is decreased partly by the BRAF(V600E) mutation, with direct impact on significant hormone production. TPOAbs may play a protective role in breast cancer development. An understanding of TPO and its unique two enzymatic active sites and autoantigenic determinants continues to add new knowledge on the biochemistry and immunology of this enzyme.

AB Bacterial survive and respond to adverse changes in the environment by regulating gene transcription through two-component regulatory systems. In Salmonella Typhimurium the STM1485 gene expression is induced under low pH (4.5) during replication inside the epithelial host cell, but it is not involved in sensing or resisting to this condition. Since the RcsCDB system is activated under acidic conditions, we investigated whether this system is able to modulate STM1485 expression. We demonstrated that acid-induced activation of the RcsB represses STM1485 transcription by directly binding to the promoter. Under the same condition, the RstA regulator activates the expression of this gene. Physiologically, we observed that RcsB-dependent repression is required for the survival of bacteria when they are exposed to pancreatic fluids. We hypothesized that STM1485 plays an important role in Salmonella adaptation to pH changes, during transition in the gastrointestinal tract. We suggest that bacteria surviving the gastrointestinal environment invade the epithelial cells, where they can remain in vacuoles. In this new environment, acidity and magnesium starvation activate the expression of the RstA regulator in a PhoPQ-dependent manner, which in turn induces STM1485 expression. These levels of STM1485 allow increased bacterial replication within vacuoles to continue the course of infection.

AB Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the neurotrophic factors that are vital to the survival and proliferation of neuron. Thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) is a redox regulating protein and plays various roles in regulating transcript factors and inhibiting apoptosis. It has been reported that Trx-1 is required for nerve growth factor-mediated signal transduction and neurite outgrowth, and is involved in synaptic protein expression induced by BDNF. However, the molecular mechanism on BDNF inducing Trx-1 expression has not been fully verified. The present study investigated the expression of Trx-1 after treatment with BDNF in SH-SY5Y cells. We first demonstrated that cell viability and the expression of Trx-1 were increased by BDNF in SH-SY5Y cells, which were inhibited by the tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) inhibitor, K252a, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitor, LY294002. Moreover, BDNF increased the activity of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) through TrkB/PI3-K/Akt pathway. Whereas the expression of Trx-1 induced by BDNF was suppressed by CREB siRNA. Thus, our data suggest that BDNF induces the expression of Trx-1 through the TrkB/Akt/CREB pathway. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB Nanoparticles (NPs) are one of the leading and promising technologies for gene and drug delivery. However, despite continuous advancements in the delivery of NPs, endosomal escape remains a major issue and a matter of grave concern for developing an efficient and targeted delivery system for therapeutic applications. Most of NPs generally follow endocytic pathway for internalization into the cells. Following the internalization process, NPs must escape into the cell cytoplasm for evading degradation by hydrolytic enzymes present in the lysosomes. Various types of lipids have been used in the past viz. fusogenic lipid dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), pH-sensitive lipids, cationic lipid and multiple charges containing lipid to escape from endosomes. Recently, several novel polymers, pH-sensitive peptides, proteins and many others endosomolytic agents have been identified and developed for incorporating into gene and drug delivery system to facilitate endosomal escape. In this review, endosomal escape mechanisms of different types of NPs have been discussed in detail and compared with endosomal escape mechanisms of viruses and other synthetic gene delivery systems to escape from endosomes. Also, the designing of endosomolytic agents to facilitate endosomal escape based on different approaches and strategies is explored. Moreover, this review article highlights the recent advancements in the development of NPs equipped with endosomolytic agents including its future directions and applications in the field of nanomedicine.

AB L-Dopa decarboxylase (DDC) catalyzes the decarboxylation of L-Dopa to dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) to serotonin. Although DDC has been purified from a variety of peripheral organs, including the liver, kidney and pancreas, the physiological significance of the peripherally expressed enzyme is not yet fully understood. DDC has been considered as a potential novel biomarker for various types of cancer, however, the role of DDC in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be evaluated. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), on the other hand, has been shown to play a key role in the tumorigenesis, proliferation, metastasis, apoptosis, and angiogenesis of HCC by regulating gene expression. We initially identified the interaction of DDC with PI3K by means of the phage display methodology. This association was further confirmed in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, human embryonic kidney cells, human neuroblastoma cells, as well as mouse brain, by the use of specific antibodies raised against DDC and PI3K. Functional aspects of the above interaction were studied upon treatment with the DDC inhibitor carbidopa and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Interestingly, our data demonstrate the expression of the neuronal type DDC mRNA in HCC cells. The present investigation provides new evidence on the possible link of DDC with the PI3K pathway, underlining the biological significance of this complex enzyme.

AB The aim of this work was to find a minimal set of structurally stable pentapeptides, which allows forming a polypeptide chain of a required 3D structure. To search for factors that ensure structural stability of the pentapeptide, we generated peptide sequences with no more than three functional groups, based on the alanine pentapeptide AAAAA. We analyzed 44,860 structures of peptides by the molecular dynamics method and found that 1,225 pentapeptides over 80% of the simulation time were in a stable conformation. Clustering of these conformations revealed 54 topological types of conformationally stable pentapeptides. These conformations relate to different combined elements of the protein secondary structure. So, we obtained a minimal set of amino acid structures of conformationally stable pentapeptides, creating a complete set of different topologies that ensure the formation of pre-folded conformation of protein structures.

AB A novel strain of Actinomycetes was isolated from the body of an ant (Camponotus vagus Scopoli) and its genetic and morphological properties were characterized. The 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis of the isolate revealed its high phylogenetic relationship with type strains of Streptomyces violaceochromogenes NBRC 13100(T). As a result of antimicrobial activity assessment, it was found that the fermentation broth of the isolated strain both inhibited the growth and induced the SOS response in E. coli BW25113 Delta tolC strain cells. Using bioassay-guided fractionation, mass spectrometric and NMR analyses we identified the active compound to be nybomycin, a previously described antibiotic. Here we report for the first time Streptomyces producer of nybomycin in association with carpenter ants and demonstrate cytotoxic activity of nybomycin against human cell lines.

AB Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the primary target of organophosphorus pesticides (OPs). Ellman's method using Acetylthiocholine (ATCh) is the standard approach for the detection of AChE activity. Though ATCh is a popular substrate, it has certain drawbacks as well. Because of these limitations, there is a need for the development of reliable and rapid assays for determination of AChE activity in cases of OP poisoning. In the present work, we have used 1-Naphthyl acetate (1-NA) as a fluorogenic substrate for the estimation of AChE activity of human erythrocytes. It is well known that due to inter-individual variation in AChE activity, the baseline value cannot be correctly predicted. Therefore, using 1-NA, we have developed a rapid, sensitive and baseline free assay for the estimation of AChE activity. The assay is based on reactivation and fluorescence quenching using a cocktail of oximes for the determination of cholinesterase activity in a post-exposure sample. Moreover, it is free from interference due to oximolysis which is an established limitation of ATCh. We feel that such an assay using 1-NA has the potential to be explored at the point of care for rapid detection of OP poisoning.

AB Background: Increased DAN protein (Grem1, Grem2, Grem3, Cerberus, NBL1, SOST, and USAG1) levels are often associated with severe disease-states in adult kidneys. Grem1, SOST, and USAG1 have been demonstrated to be upregulated and play a critical role in the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN); however, the expression and the role of other DAN family members in DN have not been reported yet. In this study, we investigated the expression and the role of Grem2 in the development of renal lesions in mice with type 2 DN.
   Methods: Fourteen-week-old BTBRob/ob (a mouse model of type 2 diabetes mellitus) and control (BTBR, wild type) mice were evaluated for renal functional and structural biomarkers. Urine was collected for protein content assay, and renal tissues were harvested for molecular analysis with real-time PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. In vitro studies, human podocytes were transfected with Grem2 plasmid and were evaluated for apoptosis (morphologic assay and Western blotting). To evaluate the Grem2-mediated downstream signaling, the phosphorylation status of Smad2/3 and Smad1/5/8 was assessed. To establish a causal relationship, the effect of SIS3 (an inhibitor for Samd2/3) and BMP-7 (an agonist for Smad1/5/8) was evaluated on Germ2-induced podocyte apoptosis.
   Results: BTBRob/ob mice showed elevated urinary protein levels. Renal tissues of BTBRob/ob mice showed an increased expression of Grem2; both glomerular and tubular cells displayed enhanced Grem2 expression. In vitro studies, high glucose increased Grem2 expression in cultured human podocytes, whereas, Grem2 silencing partially protected podocyte from high glucose-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of Grem2 in podocytes not only increased Bax/Bcl2 expression ratio but also promoted podocyte apoptosis; moreover, an overexpression of Grem2 increased the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and decreased the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8; furthermore, SIS3 and BMP-7 attenuated Grem2-induced podocyte apoptosis.
   Conclusions: High glucose increases Grem2 expression in kidney cells. Grem2 mediates podocyte apoptosis through Smads. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM). All rights reserved.

AB Conformation of the telomeric DNA fragment dG(3)(TTAG(3))(3) depends on multiple factors including solution conditions, length, and the nucleotide sequence of the flanking regions. In potassium solution, this sequence tends to adopt hybrid (3 + 1) G-quadruplex (G4) Form 1 or Form 2 conformation contingent on the flanking nucleotides. Theoretically, other (3 + 1) G4 folds (beyond Forms 1 and 2) are not sterically forbidden, but are presumably energetically disfavored. We report here on the effect of substituting the TTA loop with a single T nucleotide for one, two, or three loops of telomeric DNA that allowed us to expand the conformational diversity of the G4 DNA. Circular dichroism, gel migration, and chemical probing with DMS and ZnP1 (a porphyrin derivative sensitive to G4 conformation) were applied to monitor conformations that occurred upon shortening each loop to a single nucleotide. We found that all oligonucleotide models formed an intramolecular quadruplex structure and that shortening the loops led to the prevalence of G4 with quartets of the same polarity. Despite similar CD signatures, each modified sequence had one of three specific patterns of light-induced oxidation with ZnP1. According to the predominant modification pattern, folding of each sequence could be assigned to one of three major G4 conformations: parallel and two different (3 + 1) G4 folds. We here provide novel experimental evidence of the propensity for modified telomeric sequences to form a (3 + 1) G4 conformer containing one lateral and two propeller loops.

AB The bile alcohol 5 beta-scymnol ([24R]-(+)-5 beta-cholestan-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,24,26,27-hexol) is a therapeutic nutraceutical derived from marine sources, however very little is known about its potential for biotransformation as a xenobiotic in higher vertebrates. In this study, biotransformation products of scymnol catalysed by liver microsomes isolated from normal and streptozotocin (STZ)-treated male Wistar rats were characterised by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MSMS). In order of increasing polarity relative to the reversed phase sorbent, structural assignments were made for four biotransformation products, namely 3-oxoscymnol (5 beta-cholestan-3-one-7 alpha,12 alpha,24,26,27-pentol); 7-oxoscymnol (5 beta-cholestan-7-one-3 alpha,12 alpha,24,26,27-pentol); 3 beta-scymnol (5 beta-cholestan-3 beta,7 alpha,12 alpha,24,26,27-hexol) and 6 beta-hydroxyscymnol (5 beta-cholestan-3 alpha,6 beta,7 alpha,12 alpha,24,26,27-heptol). In addition, a total of eight biotransformation products were characterised from microsomal incubations of crude oxoscymnol compounds, namely 7 beta-scymnol; 3,12-dioxoscymnol; 3,7-dioxoscymnol; 7,12-dioxoscymnol; 12-oxo-3 beta-scymnol; 7-oxo-3 beta-scymnol; 6 beta-hydroxy-12-oxoscymnol and 6 beta-hydroxy-7-oxoscymnol. Collectively, the results indicate hepatic enzyme-catalysed hydroxylation, dehydrogenation and epimerisation reactions on the steroid nucleus of scymnol, and provide an insight into biotransformation pathways for scymnol use as a therapeutic nutraceutical in higher vertebrates.

AB Microcin J25 (MccJ25), an antimicrobial peptide, targets the respiratory chain but the exact mechanism by which it does so remains unclear. Here, we reveal that MccJ25 is able to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the isolated cytochrome bd-I from E. coli and induces at the same time production of reactive oxygen species. MccJ25 behaves as a dose-dependent weak inhibitor. Intriguingly, MccJ25 is capable of producing a change in the oxidation state of cytochrome bd-I causing its partial reduction in the presence of cyanide. These effects are specific for cytochrome bd-I, since the peptide is not able to act on purified cytochrome bo(3).

AB Monomeric isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) have once been proposed to be exclusively NADP(+)-specific. Intriguingly, we recently have reported an NAD(+)-specific monomeric IDH from Campylobacter sp. FOBRC14 (CaIDH). Moreover, bioinformatic analysis revealed at least three different coenzyme-binding motifs among Campylobacter IDHs. Besides the NAD(+)-binding motif in CaIDH (Leu(584)/Asp(595)/Ser(644)), a typical NADP(+)-binding motif was also identified in Campylobacter corcagiensis IDH (CcoIDH, His(582)/Arg(593)/Arg(638)). Meanwhile, a third putative NAD(+)-binding motif was found in Campylobacter concisus IDH (CcIDH, Leu(580)/Leu(591)/Ala(640)). In this study, CcIDH was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Gel filtration chromatography demonstrated that the recombinant CcIDH exists as a monomer in solution. Kinetic analysis showed that the K-m value of CcIDH for NADP(+) was over 49-fold higher than that for NAD(+) and the catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K-m) of CcIDH is 115-fold greater for NAD(+) than NADP(+). Thus, CcIDH is indeed an NAD(+)-specific enzyme. However, the catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K-m = 0.886 mu M-1 s(-1)) of CcIDH for NAD(+) is much lower (<5%) when compared to that of the typical monomeric NADP-IDHs for NADP(+). Then, the three core NAD(+)-binding sites were evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant CcIDH ((HRR640)-R-580-R-591) showed a 51-fold higher K-m value for NAD(+) and 21-fold lower K-m value for NADP(+) as compared to that of the wild type enzyme, respectively. The overall specificity of the mutant CcIDH was 12-fold greater for NADP(+) than that for NAD(+). Thus, the coenzyme specificity of CcIDH was converted from NAD(+) to NADP(+). Isocitrate dependence of enzyme kinetics showed that although the mutant (HRR640)-R-580-R-591 preferred NADP(+) as its coenzyme, its catalytic efficiency for isocitrate reduced to half of that for the wild-type CcIDH as using NAD(+). The finding of both NAD(+) and NADP(+)-binding sites in monomeric IDHs from Campylobacter species will provide us a chance to explore the evolution of the coenzyme specificity in monomeric IDH subfamily.

AB Understanding the relationship between genotype and phenotype is a central goal not just for genetics but also for medicine and biological sciences. Despite outstanding technological progresses, genetics alone is not able to completely explain phenotypes, in particular for complex diseases. Given the existence of a "missing heritability", growing attention has been given to non-mendelian mechanisms of inheritance and to the role of the environment. The study of interaction between gene and environment represents a challenging but also a promising field with high potential for health prevention, and epigenetics has been suggested as one of the best candidate to mediate environmental effects on the genome.
   Among environmental factors able to interact with both genome and epigenome, nutrition is one of the most impacting. Not just our genome influences the responsiveness to food and nutrients, but vice versa, nutrition can also modify gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms. In this complex picture, nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics represent appealing disciplines aimed to define new prospectives of personalized nutrition. This review introduces to the study of gene-environment interactions and describes how nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics modulate health, promoting or affecting healthiness through life-style, thus playing a pivotal role in modulating the effect of genetic predispositions.

AB POSTN knockdown inhibits the formation of NLRP3 inflammasome in rat myocardium. Periostin (POSTN), an extracellular matrix protein, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha), a ligand-activated nuclear transcription factor, are reported to be involved in renal and cardiac dysfunction associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD), respectively. This study is performed to investigate how POSTN-PPAR alpha axis affects the progress of CKD. In vivo, adenovirus particles containing POSTN short hairpin RNA (Ad-shPOSTN) were intravenously given to Sprague Dawley rats following 5/6 nephrectomy. The effects of Ad-shPOSTN on CKD and CKD-associated cardiovascular disease were evaluated. In vitro, NRK-52E renal tubular epithelial cells were infected with Ad-shPOSTN or Ad-POSTN (overexpression) to explore whether POSTN affected collagen deposition by regulating PPAR alpha. We found that POSTN expression was upregulated, while PPAR alpha was downregulated in the injured renal and left ventricular tissues of nephrectomized rats. Ad-shPOSTN improved renal function, prevented cardiac dysfunction, and attenuated organ fibrosis in nephrectomized rats. The expression levels of renal and myocardial PPAR alpha were increased following Ad-shPOSTN administration. Furthermore, POSTN silencing suppressed the formation of NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in the myocardium: the levels of NLRP3, anti-apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), cleaved caspase 1, mature interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-18 were reduced. In NRK-52E cells, forced overexpression of POSTN directly inhibited PPAR alpha expression and induced collagen deposition. WY14643, a PPAR alpha agonist, suppressed POSTN-induced collagen deposition. In summary, our study demonstrates that POSTN negatively regulates PPAR alpha expression. Targeting POSTN-PPAR alpha axis may present a novel protective intervention to alleviate CKD and CKD-associated cardiac dysfunction.

AB Constant addition of heavy metal pollutants in soil resulting from anthropogenic activities can prove detrimental to both macro and micro life forms inhabiting the ecosystem. The potential functional roles of eukaryotic microbes in such environment were explored in this study by metatranscriptomics approach. Sized eukaryotic cDNA libraries, library A (<0.5 kb), library B (0.5-1.0 kb), and library C (>1 kb) were constructed from the soil RNA and screened for copper (Cu) tolerance genes by using copper sensitive yeast mutant strain cup1(Delta). Screening of the cDNA libraries yielded different clones capable of growing in Cu amended medium. In the present investigation, one of the transcripts PLCc38 from the library C was characterized and tested for its ability to tolerate different heavy metals by using metal sensitive yeast mutants. Sequence analysis PLCc38 showed homology with aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and capable of tolerating high concentrations of Cu (150-1000 mu M). Aldeyde dehydrogenases are stress response enzymes capable of eliminating toxic levels of aldehydes generated due to abiotic environmental stresses. The cDNA PLCc38 also provided tolerance to wide range of Cd (40-100 mu M), Zn (10-13 mM) and Co (2-50 mM) concentrations. Oxidative stress tolerance potential of PLCc38 was also confirmed in presence of different concentrations of H2O2. This study proves that PLCc38 is a potent gene associated with metal tolerance which could be used to revegetate heavy metal polluted soil or as a biomarker for detection of metal contamination.

AB Ovarian cancer is one the prevalent cancers in women and is responsible for 5% of all the cancer related mortalities in women. Owing to late diagnosis, frequent relapses, side effects of chemotherapy, development of drug resistance, there is pressing need to screen out novel and effective treatment options. Accumulating evidences suggest that miRNAs may prove essential therapeutic targets for the treatment of cancer. This study was designed to investigate the role and therapeutic potential of miR-34 in ovarian cancer. It was found that miR-34 is significantly downregulated in ovarian cancer cell lines. Overexpression of miR-34 causes significant decrease in the proliferation of OVACAR-3 ovarian cancer cells via activation of apoptosis and autophagy. The miR-34 overexpression was concomitant with upsurge of apoptosis related proteins (Bax) and the autophagy associated protein (LC3 II and p62). TargetScan analysis showed Notch 1 to be the main target of miR-34 in OVACAR-3 cells which was further validated by luciferase reporter assay. The qRT-PCR results showed Notch 1 to be 3.2-4.1 fold higher in the ovarian cancer cell lines relative to the non-cancerous cells. Nonetheless, miR-34 overexpression in OVACAR-3 cells resulted in the post-transcriptional suppression of Notch 1 expression. Silencing of Notch 1 also caused inhibition of OVACAR-3 cell proliferation via induction of apoptosis and autophagy. Overexpression of Notch 1 could partially rescue the effects of miR-34 overexpression on the proliferation of OVACAR-3 cells. Moreover, overexpression of miR-34 causes significant inhibition of the invasion of the OVACAR-3 cells. The findings of the present study indicate the tumor suppressive role of miR-34 in ovarian cancer and may therefore prove to be a potential therapeutic target. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Here, for the first time, we report the presence of highly active extracellular carbonic anhydrase (CA) of alpha-class in cyanobacterial cells. The enzyme activity was confirmed both in vivo in intact cells and in vitro, using the recombinant protein. CA activity in intact cells of Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 reached similar to 0.6 Wilbur-Anderson units (WAU) per 1 mg of total cell protein, and it was inhibited by a specific CAs inhibitor, ethoxyzolamide. The genes cce_4328 (ecaA) and cce_0871 (ecaB), encoding two potential extracellular CAs of Cyanothece have been cloned, and the corresponding proteins EcaA and EcaB, representing CAs of alpha- and beta-class, respectively, have been heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. High specific activity (similar to 1.1 x 10(4) WAU per 1 mg of target protein) was detected for the recombinant EcaA only. The presence of EcaA in the outer cellular layers of Cyanothece was confirmed by immunological analysis with antibodies raised against the recombinant protein. The absence of redox regulation of EcaA activity indicates that this protein does not possess a disulfide bond essential for some alpha-class CAs. The content and activity of EcaA in a fraction of periplasmic proteins was higher in Cyanothece cells grown at ambient concentration of CO2 (0.04%) compared to those grown at an elevated CO2 concentration (1.7%). At the same time, the level of ecaA gene mRNA varied insignificantly in response to changes in CO2 supply. Our results indicate that EcaA is responsible for CA activity of intact Cyanothece cells and point to its possible physiological role under low-CO2 conditions.

AB The choice of food is governed largely by the sense of taste. To date, five basic taste modalities have been described; however, there is an increasing agreement on the existence of a 6th fat taste. The taste modalities might interact with each other and also with other senses. The advancements in cellular and molecular biology have helped the characterization of taste signaling mechanisms, down to the receptor level and beyond. CD36 and GPR120 have been shown to be involved in the detection of fat taste while bitter taste is perceived by a number of receptors that belong to a family of taste-type 2 receptors (T2R or TAS2R). Hence, the most common role is played by TAS2R16 and TAS2R38 in bitter taste perception in humans. Increasing evidences from behavioural studies suggest that fat and bitter taste modalities might interact with each other, and this interaction might be critical in obesity. In the current review, we will discuss the evidence from genetic and behavioural studies and propose the molecular mechanism of a cross-talk between fat and bitter tastes.

AB Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) involves a panel of pathologies starting with hepatic steatosis and continuing to irreversible and serious conditions like steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatocarcinoma. NAFLD is multifactorial in origin and corresponds to abnormal fat deposition in liver. Even if triglycerides are mostly associated with these pathologies, other lipid moieties seem to be involved in the development and severity of NAFLD. That is the case with sphingolipids and more particularly ceramides. In this review, we explore the relationship between NAFLD and sphingolipid metabolism. After providing an analysis of complex sphingolipid metabolism, we focus on the potential involvement of sphingolipids in the different pathologies associated with NAFLD. An unbalanced ratio between ceramides and terminal metabolic products in the liver and plasma promotes weight gain, inflammation, and insulin resistance. In the etiology of NAFLD, some sphingolipid species such as ceramides may be potential biomarkers for NAFLD. We review the clinical relevance of sphingolipids in liver diseases.

AB Background: Fatty acids (FAs), and especially monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs) stimulate GLP-1 release. However, lipotoxicity is indicated in GLP-1 secreting cells following long-term exposure to elevated levels of saturated FAs (SFAs) in vivo and in vitro, where in vitro studies indicate that cosupplementation with MUFAs confers lipoprotection. SFAs and MUFAs differentially affect the fate of cells in ways that depend on the cell type, concentration and ratio of the FAs. The present study was designed to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the effects of SFAs/MUFAs on GLP-1-producing cells in terms of lipotoxicity/lipoprotection and GLP-1 secretion.
   Methods: Cultured GLP-1 secreting cells were exposed to hyperlipidemia simulated by SFA-albumin complexes where the molar ratio was 2:1. The cellular response to simulated hyperlipidemia was assessed in the presence/absence of MUFA cosupplementation by determining intracellular ceramide, ROS, neutral lipid accumulation, and cellular respiration. The role for cellular respiration in GLP-1 secretion in response to SFAs/MUFAs was assessed.
   Results: Generation of intracellular ceramide mediate a detrimental increased in ROS production following long term exposure to SFAs in GLP-1-secreting cells. Cosupplementation with MUFAs increases cellular respiration, triglyceride synthesis, and the expression of ceramide kinase, while reducing ceramide synthesis and attenuating ROS production, caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation. Further, acute secretory effects of unsaturated FAs are independent of FAO, but mediated by a FFAR1 induced increase in cellular respiration.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates novel data supporting effects of MUFAs on the ceramide biosynthetic pathway, triglyceride storage respiration and secretion in GLP-1 secreting cells. These findings may be of value for nutritional interventions, as well as for identification of novel targets, to help preserve L-cell mass and potentiate GLP-1 secretion in diabesity.

AB The n-3 docosapentaenoic acid (n-3 DPA) is less studied n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA), compared to its counterparts eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Present in food sources in non-negligible quantities, as well as in human milk, dietary n-3 DPA is of current interest both for its ability to increase EPA and DHA tissue status and for its specific or shared biological effects. Indeed, some evidence showed that dietary n-3 DPA is a source of EPA and slightly DHA in the major metabolic organs. n-3 DPA is also the precursor of a large panel of lipid mediators (protectins, resolvins, maresins, isoprostanes) principally implicated in the pro-resolution of the inflammation with specific effects compared to the other n-3 LCPUFA. Recent results showed that n-3 DPA is implied in the improvement of cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk markers, especially plasma lipid parameters, platelet aggregation, insulin sensitivity and cellular plasticity. Moreover, n-3 DPA is the most abundant n-3 LCPUFA in the brain after DHA and it could be specifically beneficial for elderly neuroprotection, and early-life development. These results led to the development of two drugs specifically containing n-3 DPA. This review summarizes the different knowledge about n-3 DPA direct and indirect sources, availability and purification methods, focusing thereafter on the recent findings showing n-3 DPA relationship with fatty acid metabolism, lipid mediators, Finally, the n-3 DPA biological and pharmacological effects are described.

AB Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) damage is a primary sign in the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) the leading cause of blindness in western countries. RPE cells are exposed to chronic oxidative stress due to constant light exposure, active fatty acid metabolism and high oxygen consumption. RPE cells phagocytosize lipid rich photoreceptor outer segment (POS) which is regulated by circadian rhytmn. Docosahexaenoic acid is present in high quantity in POS and increases oxidative stress, while its metabolites have cytoprotective effects in RPE. During RPE aging, reactive oxygen species and oxidized lipoproteins are considered to be major causes of disturbed autophagy clearance that lead to chronic innate immunity response involved in NOD-Like, Toll-Like, Advanced Glycation End product Receptors (NLRP, TLR, RAGE, respectively), pentraxins and complement systems. We discuss role of fatty acids and lipoproteins in the degeneration of RPE and development of AMD. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The double lipoxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is possible with PUFA having at least three methylene-interrupted double bonds. Several PUFA of the omega-3/n-3 and -6 families may be converted through this route, and the products show interesting inhibitory effects on blood platelet function and cyclooxygenase activities. This review focuses on two main omega-3 PUFA of nutritional interest, namely docosahexaenoic acid (DHA/22: 6n-3) and alpha linolenic acid (ALA/18: 3n-3). The chemical configuration of the double lipoxygenase end-product from DHA (protectin DX) is compared with that of protectin D1 which is produced through a mono-lipoxygenation step followed by an epoxidation and epoxide hydrolysis process. The different metabolic pathways are discussed as well as the different biological activities of both protectins. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Neuroinflammation is a physiologic response aimed at protecting the central nervous system during injury. However, unresolved and chronic neuroinflammation can lead to long term damage and eventually neurologic disease including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Recently, enhancing the concentration of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) through blocking their hydrolytic degradation by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) has been applied towards reducing the long-term damage associated with central neurologic insults. Evidence suggests this protective effect is mediated, at least in part, through polarization of microglia to an anti-inflammatory phenotype that blocks the inflammatory actions of prostaglandins and promotes wound repair. This mini-review overviews the epidemiologic basis for using sEH inhibition towards neuroinflammatory disease and pharmacologic studies testing sEH inhibition in several neurologic diseases. Additionally, the combination of sEH inhibition with other eicosanoid signaling pathways is considered as an enhanced approach for developing potent neuroprotectants.

AB Obesity is now widely recognized to be associated with low-grade systemic inflammation. It has been shown that high-fat feeding modulates gut microbiota which strongly increased intestinal permeability leading to lipopolysaccharide absorption causing metabolic endotoxemia that triggers inflammation and metabolic disorders. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been shown associated with antiobesity properties, but results still remain heterogeneous and very few studies underlined the metabolic pathways involved. Thus, the use of Fat-1 transgenic mice allows to better understanding whether endogenous n-3 PUFAs enrichment contributes to obesity and associated metabolic disorders prevention. It specially evidence that such effects occur through modulations of gut microbiota and intestinal permeability. Then, by remodeling gut microbiota, endogenous n-3 PUFAs improve HF/HS-diet induced features of the metabolic syndrome which in turn affects host metabolism. Thus, increasing anti-obesogenic microbial species in the gut microbiota population (i.e Akkermansia) by appropriate n-3 PUFAs may represent a promising strategy to control or prevent metabolic diseases.

AB The identification of a functional molecular moiety relating the lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) to their capacity to induce inflammation-mediated metabolic diseases needed to be performed. We previously described a proportional increase in the relative abundance of the 16 SrDNA bacterial gene from the genus Ralstonia, within the microbiota from the adipose tissue stroma vascular fraction of obese patients, suggesting a causal role of the bacteria. Therefore, we first characterized the structures of the lipids A, the inflammatory inducing moieties of LPSs, of three Ralstonia species: Ralstonia eutropha, R. mannitolilytica and R. pickettii, and then compared each, in terms of in vitro inflammatory capacities. R. pickettii lipid A displaying only 5 Fatty Acids (FA) was a weaker inducer of inflammation, compared to the two other species harboring hexa-acylated lipids A, despite the presence of 2 AraN substituents on the phosphate groups.
   With regard to in vitro pro-inflammatory activities, TNF-alpha and IL-6 inducing capacities were compared on THP-1 cells treated with LPSs isolated from the three Ralstonia. R. pickettii, with low inflammatory capacities, and recently involved in nosocomial outcomes, could explain the low inflammatory level reported in previous studies on diabetic patients and animals. In addition, transmission electron microscopy was performed on the three Ralstonia species. It showed that the R. pickettii under-acylated LPSs, with a higher level of phosphate substitution had the capacity of producing more outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). The latter could facilitate transfer of LPSs to the blood and explain the increased low-grade inflammation observed in obese/diabetic patients.

Bordetella avium lipopolysaccharides have been shown to be important virulence factors for this bird pathogen. B. hinzii is closely related to the B. avium species, but has also been isolated from humans. B. trematum is associated to ear and blood infections in humans. Its lipid A structure, the biological active moiety of LPS, was found to be closely related to those of B. avium and B. hinzii. It is important to unveil the subtle structural modifications orchestrated during the LPS biosynthetic pathway to better understand host adaptation. The present data are also important in the context of deciphering the virulence pathways of this important genus containing the major pathogens B. pertussis and B. parapertussis, responsible for whooping cough. We recently reported the isolated lipid A structures of the three presented species, following the previously identified O-chain structures. In the present study, we provide details on the free and O-chain-linked core oligosaccharides which were required to characterize the complete LPS structures. Data are presented here in relation to relevant biosynthesis genes. The present characterization of the three species is well illustrated by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Mass Spectrometry experiments, and data were obtained mainly on native LPS molecules for the first time.

AB In Gram-negative bacteria, the cell envelope largely consists of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a class of heterogeneous glycolipids. As a fundamental component of the outer membrane, LPS provides stability to the bacterial cell and forms a protective cover shielding it from hostile environments. LPS is not only fundamental to bacterial viability, but also makes a substantial contribution both directly and indirectly to multiple aspects of inter-organismic interactions. During infection of animal and plant hosts, LPS promotes bacterial virulence but simultaneously betrays bacteria to the host immune system. Moreover, dynamic remodulation of LPS structures allows bacteria to fine-tune OM properties and quickly adapt to diverse and often hostile environments, such as those encountered in host tissues. Here, we summarize recent insights into the multiple functions of LPS in plant-bacteria interactions and discuss what we can learn from the latest advances in the field of animal immunity. We further pinpoint open questions and future challenges to unravel the different roles of LPS in the dynamic interplay between bacteria and plant hosts at the mechanistic level.

AB Systemic inflammation plays a pivotal role in a multitude of conditions, including sepsis, trauma, major surgery and burns. However, comprehensive analysis of the pathophysiology underlying this systemic inflammatory response is greatly complicated by variations in the immune response observed in critically ill patients, which is a result of inter-individual differences in comorbidity, comedication, source of infection, causative pathogen, and onset of the inflammatory response. During experimental human endotoxemia, human subjects are challenged with purified endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) intravenously which induces a short-lived, well-tolerated and controlled systemic inflammatory response, similar to that observed during sepsis. The human endotoxemia model can be conducted in a highly standardized and reproducible manner, using a carefully selected homogenous study population. As such, the experimental human endotoxemia model does not share the aforementioned clinical limitations and enables us to investigate both the mechanisms of systemic inflammation, as well as to evaluate novel (pharmacological) interventions in humans in vivo. The present review provides a detailed overview of the various designs, organ-specific changes, and strengths and limitations of the experimental human endotoxemia model, with the main focus on its use as a translational model for sepsis research.

AB Intestinal ischemia, also called mesenteric ischemia, is a severe gastrointestinal and vascular medical emergency caused by a sudden decrease of blood flow through the mesenteric vessels. It generates hypoperfusion of intestinal tissues and can rapidly progress to intestinal wall infarction, systemic inflammation or even death if not treated in time. The mortality of this condition is still considerably high despite all the medical advances of the past few years. This is partially due to the difficulty of diagnosing early stage mesenteric ischemia. Indeed, a speedy and correct diagnosis is decisive for suitable medical care. However, early symptoms are unspecific and conventional clinical markers are neither specific nor sensitive enough. In the last few years, significant clinical and preclinical efforts have been made to find biomarkers which could predict gastrointestinal damage before it becomes irreversible. Here, the gut-derived hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is described as a potential early biomarker of this severe condition. Indeed, GLP-1 plasma levels rise rapidly in both mice and humans with intestinal ischemia. This discovery could counter the cruel lack of clinical biomarkers available to diagnose and therefore manage intestinal ischemia efficiently in the early stages. GLP-1 could thus become part of a panel of biomarkers for intestinal ischemia and could help to reduce the associated high mortality rates.

AB Diet-induced obesity (DIO) is associated with a decreased oral fat detection in rodents. This alteration has been explained by an impairment of the lipid-mediated signaling in taste bud cells (TBC). However, factors responsible for this defect remain elusive. Diet rich in saturated fatty acids is known to elicit a metabolic inflammation by promoting intestinal permeation to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), Gram-negative bacteria-derived endotoxins. To determine whether a local inflammation of the gustatory tissue might explain the obese-induced impairment of the oro-sensory detection of lipids, mice were subjected to a DIO protocol. Using a combination of behavioral tests, transcriptomic analyses of gustatory papillae and biochemical assays, we have found that i) DIO elicits a pro-inflammatory genic profile in the circumvallate papillae (CVP), known to house the highest density of lingual taste buds, ii) NFkB, a key player of inflammatory process, might play a role in this transcriptomic pattern, iii) plasma LPS levels are negatively correlated with the preference for oily solution, and iv) a chronic infusion of LPS at a level similar to that found in DIO mice is not sufficient to alter the spontaneous preference for fat in lean mice. Taken together these data bring the demonstration that a saturated high fat diet elicits an inflammatory response at the level of peripheral gustatory pathway and a LPS-induced low-grade endotoxemia alone does not explain the change in the preference for dietary lipids observed in DIO mice.

AB SEPTIN12 (SEPT12) is a testis-enriched gene that is downregulated in the testis of infertile men with severe spermatogenic defects. While SEPT12 is involved in spermatogenic failure and sperm motility disorder, SEPT12 transcriptional regulation is still unknown. Here we report the promoter region of SEPT12 as a 245 bp segment upstream of the transcription start site. One androgen receptor (AR) and two estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) binding sites in this region were initially identified by bioinformatics prediction and confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Truncated ER alpha or AR binding sites decreased the promoter activity, which indicated that the ER alpha and AR are essential for the SEPT12 promoter. On the other hand, the promoter activity was enhanced by the treatment with 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (5 alpha-DHT). Thus, one androgen and two estrogen hormone responsive elements located in the promoter of SEPT12 gene can regulate SEPT12 expression.
   Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs759992 T> C and rs3827527 C> T, were observed in the SEPT12 gene promoter region and were able to decrease the promoter activity. In conclusion, the current work identified the promoter of the human SEPT12 gene and provided key evidence about its transcriptional regulation via E2 and 5 alpha-DHT. Since SEPT12 has an important role in spermatogenesis, SEPT12 expression analysis can be developed as a potential tool for the assessment of environmental or food pollution by hormones or for the evaluation of the risk of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in general.

AB Scope: In this review, we attempt to assess how choline and folate transporters affect fetal development. We focus on how the expression of these transporters in response to choline and folate intake affects transport effectiveness. We additionally describe allelic variants of the genes encoding these transporters and their phenotypic effects.
   Methods and results: We made an extensive review of recent articles describing role of choline and folate - with particularly emphasize on their transporters - in fetal development. Folate and choline are necessary for the proper functioning of the cell and body. During pregnancy, the requirements of these nutrients increase because of elevated maternal demand and the rapid division of fetal cells. The concentrations of folate and choline in cells depend on food intake, the absorption of nutrients, and the cellular transport system, which is tissue-specific and developmentally regulated. Relatively few studies have investigated the role of choline transporters in fetal development.
   Conclusions: In this review we show relations between functioning of folate and choline transporters and fetal development. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM). All rights reserved.

AB The GGQ minidomain of the ribosomal protein eL42 was previously shown to contact the CCA-arm of P-site bound tRNA in human ribosome, indicating a possible involvement of the protein in the catalytic activity. Here, using Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe) cells, we demonstrate that the GGQ minidomain and neighboring region of eL42 is critical for the ribosomal function. Mutant eL42 proteins containing amino acid substitutions within or adjacent to the GGQ minidomain failed to complement the function of wild-type eL42, and expression of the mutant eL42 proteins led to severe growth defects. These results suggest that the mutations in eL42 interfere with the ribosomal function in vivo. Furthermore, we show that some of the mutations associated with the conserved GGQ region lead to reduced activities in the poly(Phe) synthesis and/or in the peptidyl transferase reaction with respect to puromycin, as compared with those of the wild-type ribosomes. A pK value of 6.95 was measured for the side chain of Lys-55/Arg-55, which is considerably less than that of a Lys or Arg residue. Altogether, our findings suggest that eL42 contributes to the 80S ribosome's peptidyl transferase activity by promoting the course of the elongation cycle.

AB Inflammation of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) tissues are the most common cause of pain conditions associated with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). After a tissue and/or neural damage, the inflammatory response is characterized by plasma extravasation and leukocytes infiltration in the TMJ tissues, which in turn, release inflammatory cytokines cascades responsible for inflammatory pain. Lectins are glycoproteins widely distributed in nature that may exhibit anti-inflammatory properties. This study demonstrated by molecular docking and MM/PBSA that the lectin from Dioclea violacea (DVL) interacts favorably with alpha-methyl-D-mannoside, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, and corel-sialyl-Lewis X which are associated with leukocytes migration during an inflammatory response. Wistar rats pretreated with intravenously injection of DVL demonstrated a significant inhibition of plasma extravasation induced by carrageenan (a non-neurogenic inflammatory inductor) and mustard oil (a neurogenic inflammatory inductor) in the TMJ periarticular tissues (p <0.05; ANOVA, Tukey's test). In addition, DVL significantly reduced carrageenan-induced leukocyte migration in the TMJ periarticular tissues mediated by down-regulation of ICAM-1 expression. These results suggest a potential anti-inflammatory effect of DVL in inflammatory conditions of TMJ. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB Parathyroid hormone (PTH) acts as a regulator of calcium homeostasis and bone remodeling. Runx2, an essential transcription factor in bone, is required for osteoblast differentiation. Noncoding RNAs such as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in regulating gene expression in osteoblasts. In this study, we investigated the effects of PTH on osteoblast differentiation via Runx2, lncRNA, and miRNA expression in human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) and human osteoblastic cells (MG63). PTH-treatment of hBMSCs for 24 h, 7 days, and 14 days stimulated Runx2 mRNA expression. Using bioinformatics tools, we identified 17 lncRNAs originating from human Runx2 gene. Among these, lnc-SUPT3H-1:16 (RUNX2-AS1:32) expression was highly up-regulated by the 7 d PTH-treatment in hBMSCs. We also identified miR-6797-5p as the putative target of lnc-SUPT3H-1:16 and Runx2 using bioinformatics tools. PTH-treatment increased the expression of miR-6797-5p in hBMSCs, and overexpression of miR-6797-5p decreased osteoblast differentiation in MG63 cells, suggesting a role for Inc-SUPT3H-1:16 as sponge molecule. A luciferase gene reporter assay identified direct targeting of miR-6797-5p with lnc-SUPT3H-1:16 and 3'UTR Runx2 in MG63 cells. Thus, PTH stimulated the expression of lnc-SUPT3H-1:16, miR-6797-5p and Runx2, and due to the sponging mechanism of lnc-SUPT3H-1:16 towards miR-6797-5p, Runx2 was protected, resulting in the promotion of osteoblast differentiation.

AB Cocaine, an addictive drug, is known to induce hepatotoxicity via oxidative damage and proapoptosis. Since p53, a tumor suppressor gene, plays a major role in inducing oxidative stress and apoptosis, we examined the role of p53 inhibition against cocaine-induced hepatotoxicity. Cocaine treatment significantly increased oxidative parameters (i.e., reactive oxygen species, 4-hydroxylnonenal, and protein carbonyl) in the liver of wild type (WT) mice. We found that the pharmacological (i.e. pifithrin-alpha) and genetic (i.e. p53 knockout) inhibition of p53 significantly attenuates cocaine-induced hepatotoxicity. Cocaine treatment increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in the serum of mice, signifying hepatic damage. Consistently, these increases were attenuated by inhibition of p53, implying protection against cocaine-induced hepatic damage. In addition, cocaine treatment significantly increased PKC delta, cleaved PKC delta and p53 levels in the liver of WT mice. These increases were followed by the interaction between p53 and PKC delta, and pro-apoptotic consequences (i.e., cytosolic release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3, increase in Bax level and decreases in Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL levels). These changes were attenuated by p53 depletion, reflecting that the critical role of PKC delta in p53-mediated apoptotic potentials. Combined, our results suggest that the inhibition of p53 is important for protection against oxidative burdens, pro-apoptotic events, and hepatic degeneration induced by cocaine.

AB The increased apoptosis plays an important role in bacterial invasion. In addition, LPS can induce inflammation and apoptosis of leukocytes via the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. In the present study, we investigated the potential protective role of t-arginine (L-Arg) against the apoptosis of fish leukocytes in vitro. The results of Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and TUNEL assay indicated that L-Arg significantly alleviated the apoptosis of fish leukocytes induced by LPS at 24 h and 72 h post incubation (hpi). High caspase-3 activities induced by LPS at 72 hpi were significantly inhibited by L-Arg. Moreover, L-Arg supplementation also significantly decreased the mRNA expression levels of caspases at most time points, which contributed to the anti-apoptotic roles of L-Arg. Further analysis showed that L-Arg significantly inhibited the expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-8 and TNF-alpha, partially via the down-regulation of the genes involved in NF-kappa B/MyD88 including NF-kappa B, IKK alpha and IKK gamma. The down-regulation of these pro-inflammatory cytokines by L-Arg supplementation led to the further decrease in the expression of death receptor FasL, contributing to the anti-apoptotic effect of L-Arg. In addition, L-Arg supplementation increased both iNOS mRNA expression and NO production. The mRNA expressions of several anti-oxidant enzymes including SOD, CAT and GSHPx were also significantly increased after L-Arg supplementation, which accelerated the clearance of reactive oxygen species. In all, L-Arg inhibited apoptosis of fish leukocytes both via the increased NO production and antioxidant capacity and via the inhibition of inflammation mediated by NF-kappa B/MyD88 pathway.

AB Keap1 is deemed as a suppressor of Nrf2 in cytoplasm by sequestrating Nrf2 to proteolysis as an adapter of the Cul3-Rbx1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. In the study, it was proposed that post-translational modification might affect the interaction between Nrf2 and Keap1, and the profiles of the phosphorylation of amino acid residues of Keap1 and its effects on the binding of Keap1 to Nrf2 was investigated. A mass spectrometry analysis revealed that S53 and 5293 were phosphorylated upon an oxidative stress. Using Keap1 proteins with amino acid residues mutated to glutamate to simulate the introduction of a negative charge by phosphorylation, it was found that a potential phosphorylation of S53 affected Keap1-Nrf2 binding in the pull-down assay, and induced nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Sequence homology analysis showed that S53 was highly conserved. Structural modeling around BTB domain of wild type and S53E-mutant Keap1 showed that the negative charge introduced by S53E mutation generates a salt bridge between E53 and ionized guanidine group of Arg50. Real-time qRT-PCR for transcription levels of antioxidant genes that are modulated by Nrf2 further proved the effects of the potential phosphorylation of S53 under an oxidative stress condition.
   In summary, S53 is a potential phosphorylation site of Keap1, and the phosphorylation could enhance the antioxidative capacity of cells in response to an oxidative stress. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM). All rights reserved.

AB Leukemic cells from different patients exhibit different sensitivity to anticancer drugs including doxorubicin (DOX). Resistance to chemotherapy decreases efficacy of the treatment and promotes cancer recurrence and metastases. One of the approaches to overcome drug resistance includes E2F1-mediated regulation of the p73 protein that belongs to the p53 family. Its Delta Np73 isoform exhibits pro-oncogenic effects, and TAp73 - anti-oncogenic effects. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), often found in tumors, suppresses pro-apoptotic pathways and E2F1/p73 in particular. The activity of E2F1 and p73 transcription factors is linked to metabolism of biogenic polyamines. Therefore, it could be suggested that compounds that target polyamine-metabolizing enzymes can sensitize HCMV-infected hematological malignancies to doxorubicin.
   Here we report that HCMV infection of THP-1 monocytic leukemic cells considerably elevates E2F1 levels and shifts the balance between the p73 isoforms towards Delta Np73 leading to survival of DOX-treated leukemic cells. In contrast, MDL72.527, an inhibitor of polyamine catabolism, decreases Delta Np73/TAp73 ratio and thus restores sensitivity of the cells to DOX. Our findings indicate the combination of doxorubicin and MDL72.527 may present a novel strategy for therapy of leukemia in patients with and without HCMV infection.

AB ORP2 is a sterol-binding protein with documented functions in lipid and glucose metabolism, Akt signaling, steroidogenesis, cell adhesion, migration and proliferation.
   Here we investigate the interactions of ORP2 with phosphoinositides (PIPs) by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), its affinity for cholesterol with a pull-down assay, and its capacity to transfer sterol in vitro. Moreover, we determine the effects of wild-type (wt) ORP2 and a mutant with attenuated PIP binding, ORP2(mHHK), on the subcellular distribution of cholesterol, and analyze the interaction of ORP2 with the related cholesterol transporter ORP1L.
   ORP2 showed specific affinity for PI(4,5)P-2, PI(3,4,5)P-3 and PI(4)P, with suggestive K-d values in the mu M range. Also binding of cholesterol by ORP2 was detectable, but a K-d could not be determined. Wt ORP2 was in HeLa cells mainly detected in the cytosol, ER, late endosomes, and occasionally on lipid droplets (LDs), while ORP2(mHHK) displayed an enhanced LD localization. Overexpression of wt ORP2 shifted the D4H cholesterol probe away from endosomes, while ORP2(mHHK) caused endosomal accumulation of the probe. Although ORP2 failed to transfer dehydroergosterol in an in vitro assay where OSBP is active, its knock-down resulted in the accumulation of cholesterol in late endocytic compartments, as detected by both D4H and filipin probes. Interestingly, ORP2 was shown to interact and partially co-localize on late endosomes with ORP1L, a cholesterol transporter/sensor at ER-late endosome junctions.
   Our data demonstrates that ORP2 binds several phosphoinositides, both PI(4)P and multiply phosphorylated species. ORP2 regulates the subcellular distribution of cholesterol dependent on its PIP-binding capacity. The interaction of ORP2 with ORP1L suggests a concerted action of the two ORPs.

AB Sepsis often leads to complications such as acute kidney injury (AKI) which is reported to range from 30 to 50% in critically ill patients. Dendritic (DCs) and neutrophils play a decisive role in the advancement of AKI through release of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) respectively. Both of these processes are assumed to be controlled by spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) signaling in DCs and neutrophils. However, the role of Syk signaling in these immune cells in sepsis-induced AKI has not been investigated. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a Syk inhibitor, R406 on sepsis-induced AKI in a mouse model. Renal function (creatinine/blood urea nitrogen), inflammatory cytokines (IL-6/MCP-1) in CD11c + DCs and oxidant parameters in neutrophils [inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), NADPH oxidase (NOX2), nitrotyrosine] were assessed. Our results showed elevated expression of Syk in neutrophils and CD11c + DC which was linked with increased IL-6/MCP-1 in CD11c + DCs, and iNOS, NOX2 and nitrotyrosine in neutrophils during sepsis-induced AKI. Inhibitor of Syk signaling, R406 led to improvement of sepsis-induced AKI as depicted by an attenuation of creatinine/blood urea nitrogen in serum, renal myeloperoxidase activity, and repair of tubular structures in kidney. Further, R406 led to a decrease in IL-6/MCP-1 in CD11c + DCs, and iNOS, NOX2 and nitrotyrosine in neutrophils during sepsis-induced AKI. In conclusion, our study proposes that Syk signaling in DCs and neutrophils plays a critical role during sepsis-induced AKI. Therefore, Syk inhibition in innate immune cells might serve as an effective strategy to limit inflammatory cascade during AKI.

AB Half a decade ago, transmembrane protein fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) was found to be cleaved as a novel myokine irisin, which burst into prominence for browning of white adipose tissue during exercise. However, FNDC5, the precursor of irisin, has been paid relatively little attention compared with irisin despite evidence that FNDC5 is associated with the metabolic syndrome, which accounts for one-fourth of the world's adult population and contributes to diabetes, cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Besides N-terminal and C-terminal sequences, the FNDC5 protein contains an irisin domain and a short transmembrane region. FNDC5 has shown to be widely distribute in different tissues and is highly expressed in heart, brain, liver, and skeletal muscle. Clinical studies have demonstrated that FNDC5 is essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and dysregulation of FNDC5 will lead to systemic metabolism imbalance and the onset of metabolic disorders. Growing evidence has suggested that FNDC5 gene polymorphisms are related to health and disease in different human populations. Additionally, FNDC5 has been found relevant to the regulation of metabolism and metabolic syndrome through diverse upstream and downstream signaling pathways in experimental studies. The present review summarizes the characteristics, clinical significance, and molecular mechanisms of FNDC5 in metabolic syndrome and proposes a novel concept that FNDC5 is activated by forming a putative ligand-receptor complex. Knowledge about the role of FNDC5 may be translated into drug development and clinical applications for the treatment of metabolic disorders. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The small subunit ribosomal protein uS3 is a critically important player in the ribosome-mRNA interactions during translation and has numerous functions not directly related to protein synthesis in eukaryotes. A peculiar feature of the human uS3 protein is the ability of its fragment 55-64 exposed on the 40S subunit surface near the mRNA entry channel to form cross-links with 3'-terminal dialdehyde derivatives of various unstructured RNAs and with abasic sites in single-stranded DNAs. Here we showed that the ability of the above uS3 fragment to cross-link to abasic sites in DNAs is inherent only in mature cytoplasmic 40S subunits, but not nuclear pre-40S particles, which implies that it may be relevant to the ribosome-mRNA interplay. To clarify this issue, we investigated interactions of human ribosomes with synthetic mRNA analogues bearing an abasic site protected by a photocleavable group at the 3'-termini. We found that these mRNA analogues can form specific complexes with 80S ribosomes and 40S subunits, where the undamaged upstream part of the analogue is fixed in the mRNA binding channel by interaction with the P-site tRNA, and the downstream part located outside the ribosome is cross-linked to the uS3 fragment 55-64. The yield of cross-links of the mRNA analogues was rather high when their undamaged parts were bound to the mRNA channel prior to deprotection of the abasic site enabling its covalent attachment to the 40S subunit via the uS3 protein, but not vice versa. Based on our findings, one can assume that abasic sites, which can occur in mRNAs due to oxidative stress and ageing, are able to interact directly with the uS3 fragment exposed on the 40S subunit surface near the mRNA entry channel during translation. Consequently, the 40S subunit can be considered as a potential mRNA quality controller. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM). All rights reserved.

AB Previously we had discovered unusual enzymatic activity in the marine sponge Axinella polypoides, ATP N-glycosidase (Reintamm et al., 2003). We show here that the Ephydatia muelleri mRNA encoding protein with PNP_UDP_1 (phosphorylase superfamily) signature is the secreted ATP N-glycosidase.

AB The high catalytic efficiency of enzymes under reaction conditions is one of the main goals in biocatalysis. Despite the dramatic progress in the development of more efficient biocatalysts by protein design, the search for natural enzymes with useful properties remains a promising strategy. The pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent transaminases represent a group of industrially important enzymes due to their ability to stereoselectively transfer amino groups between diverse substrates; however, the complex mechanism of substrate recognition and conversion makes the design of transaminases a challenging task. Here we report a detailed structural and kinetic study of thermostable transaminase from the bacterium Thermobaculum terrenum (TaTT) using the methods of enzyme kinetics, X-ray crystallography and molecular modeling. TaTT can convert L-branched-chain and L-aromatic amino acids as well as (R)-(+)-1-phenylethylamine at a high rate and with high enantioselectivity. The structures of TaTT in complex with the cofactor pyridoxal 5'-phosphate covalently bound to enzyme and in complex with its reduced form, pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate, were determined at resolutions of 2.19 angstrom and 1.5 angstrom, and deposited in the Protein Data Bank as entries 6GKR and 6Q8E, respectively. TaTT is a fold type IV PLP-dependent enzyme. In terms of structural similarity, the enzyme is close to known branched-chain amino acid aminotransferases, but differences in characteristic sequence motifs in the active site were observed in TaTT compared to canonical branched-chain amino acid aminotransferases, which can explain the improved binding of aromatic amino acids and (R)-(+)-1-phenylethylamine. This study has shown for the first time that high substrate specificity towards both various I.-amino acids and (R)-primary amines can be implemented within one pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent active site of fold type IV. These results complement our knowledge of the catalytic diversity of transaminases and indicate the need for further biochemical and bioinformatic studies to understand the sequence-structurefunction relationship in these enzymes.

AB The present study was designed to explore the role of transient receptor potential canonical 3 (TRPC3) in nicotine-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and its underlying mechanism. In this study, the expression and localization of alpha 5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha 5-nAchR) in lung tissues were determined by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed to examine the mRNA expression levels of alpha 5-nAchR and TRPC3 in human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). Cell viability was assessed by CCK-8 assay. Proliferation was detected by cell counting and EdU immunofluorescent staining. Fluorescence calcium imaging was carried out to measure cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) concentration. The results showed that the alpha 5-nAchR and TRPC3 expressions were significantly up-regulated in lung tissues of COPD smokers. Nicotine promoted HASMC proliferation, which was accompanied by elevated alpha 5-nAchR and TRPC3 expressions, basal [Ca2+]cyt, store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and the rate of Mn2+ quenching in HASMCs. Further investigation indicated that nicotine-induced Ca2+ response and TRPC3 up-regulation was reversibly blocked by small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppression of alpha 5-nAChR. The knockdown of TRPC3 blunted Ca2+ response and HASMC proliferation induced by nicotine. In conclusion, nicotine-induced HASMC proliferation was mediated by TRPC3-dependent calcium entry via alpha 5-nAchR, which provided a potential target for treatment of COPD.

AB Na+/K+-ATPase is responsible for maintaining electrochemical gradients of Na+ and K+, which is essential for a variety of cellular functions including neuronal activity. The alpha-subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase is composed of four different polypeptides (alpha 1 -alpha 4) encoded by different genes. Na,K-ATPase alpha 4, encoded by the ATP1A4 gene, is expressed in testis and in male germ cells of humans, rats and mice. The alpha 4 polypeptide has an important role in sperm motility, and is essential for male fertility.
   Here we present the RT-PCR cloning and characterization of the porcine ATP1A4 cDNA coding for Na+/K+-ATPase polypeptide alpha 4. The Na+/K+-ATPase polypeptide alpha 4, consisting of 1030 amino acids, displays a high homology with its human counterpart (86%). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that porcine Na+/ K+-ATPase polypeptide alpha 4 is closely related to other mammalian counterparts. In addition, the genomic structure of the porcine ATP1A4 gene was determined, and the intron-exon organization was found to be similar to that of the human ATP1A4 gene. The promoter sequence for the porcine ATP1A4 gene was also identified. Investigation of the genetic variation in the porcine ATP1A4 gene revealed a missense A/G SNP in exon 18. This A/G polymorphism results in a substitution of a methionine to a glycine residue (M888G). A very high overall DNA methylation rate of the ATP1A4 gene, 70-80%, was observed in both brain and liver. Expression analysis demonstrated that the porcine ATP1A4 gene is predominantly expressed in testis.
   The sequence of the porcine ATP1A4 cDNA encoding the Na+/K+-ATPase alpha 4 protein has been submitted to GenBank under the accession number GenBank Accession No. MG587082. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM). All rights reserved.

AB From the halophilic bacteria to human, cells have to survive under the stresses of harsh environments. Hyperosmotic stress is a process that triggers cell shrinkage, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and apoptosis and it potentially contributes to a number of human diseases. Remarkably, by high salts and organic solutes concentrations, a variety of organisms struggle with these conditions. Different strategies have been developed for cellular osmotic adaptations among which organic osmolyte synthesis/accumulation is a conserved once. Osmolytes are naturally occurring solutes used by cells of several halophilic (micro) organisms to preserve cell volume and function.
   In this review, the osmolytes diversity and their protective roles in harsh hyperosmolar environments from bacteria to human cells are highlighted. Moreover, it provides a close look at mammalian kidney osmoregulation at a molecular level. This review provides a concise view on the recent developments and advancements on the applications of osmolytes. Identification of disease-related osmolytes and their targeted-delivery may be used as a therapeutic measurement for treatment of the pathological conditions and the inherited diseases related to protein misfolding and aggregation. The molecular and cellular aspects of cell adaptation against harsh environmental osmolarity will benefit the development of effective drugs for many diseases.

AB The potent cytotoxicity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can cause various diseases, however, it may also serve as a powerful chemotherapeutic strategy capable of killing cancer cells. Oxalomalate (OMA, alpha-hydroxy-beta-oxalosuccinic acid), a tricarboxylic acid intermediate, is a well-known competitive inhibitor of two classes of NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) isoenzymes, which serve as the major antioxidants and redox regulators in the mitochondria and cytosol. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of OMA in melanoma and elucidated the associated underlying mechanisms of action using in vitro and in vivo models. OMA targeting IDH enzymes suppressed melanoma growth through activation of apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis. Mechanistically, our findings showed that OMA activated p53-mediated apoptosis through ROS-dependent ATM-Chk2 signaling and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor through ROS-dependent E2F1-mediated hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha degradation. In particular, OMA-induced suppression of IDH activity resulted in induction of ROS stress response, ultimately leading to apoptotic cell death and antiangiogenic effects in melanoma cells. Thus, OMA might be a potential candidate drug for melanoma skin cancer therapy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM). All rights reserved.

AB Neuropathic pain is caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system and has a considerable impact on the quality of life. Neuropathic pain has a dynamic and complex aetiology and gives heterogeneous symptoms across patients; therefore, it represents an important clinical challenge. Current pharmacological treatment includes tricyclic antidepressant serotonin-noradrenaline uptake inhibitors such as duloxetine, pregabalin, and gabapentin. However, these drugs do not show efficacy in all patients suffering from neuropathic pain. In this work we used a nerve chronic constriction injury mice model based on the ligation of sciatic nerve to analyse, by two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, blood proteins significantly altered by neuropathic pain one-week after surgery. A sham-ligated group of mice acting as control and a group of ligated mice treated with gabapentin were also analysed. The results indicated that four haptoglobin isoforms were significantly more expressed, while transthyretin and alpha-2-macroglobulin expression decreased in the serum of the murine neuropathic pain model with respect to the control mice. Interestingly, the treatment with the gabapentin reversed these conditions. The outcomes of this study can provide a further understanding of the pathophysiological meaning of the biomarkers involved in neuropathic pain.

AB Trematode worms of the genus Schistosoma are the causing agents of schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease responsible for a considerable economic and healthy burden worldwide. In the present work, the characterization of the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase from Schistosoma mansoni (SmDHODH) is presented. Our studies demonstrated that SmDHODH is a member of class 2 DHODHs and catalyzes the oxidation of dihydroorotate into orotate using quinone as an electron acceptor by employing a ping-pong mechanism of catalysis. SmDHODH homology model showed the presence of all structural features reported for class 2 DHODH enzymes and reveal the presence of an additional protuberant domain predicted to fold as a flexible loop and absent in the other known class 2 DHODHs. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the ligand-free forms of SmDHODH and HsDHODH undergo different rearrangements in solution. Well-known class 2 DHODH inhibitors were tested against SmDHODH and HsDHODH and the results suggest that the variable nature of the quinone-binding tunnel between human and parasite enzymes, as well as the differences in structural plasticity involving rearrangements of the N-terminal alpha-helical domain can be exploited for the design of SmDHODH selective inhibitors, as a strategy to validate DHODH as a drug target against schistosomiasis.

AB Arginine vasopressin (AVP), a peptide secreted from the posterior pituitary, is chiefly regarded as a hormone involved in the regulation of body fluid balance and osmolality. However, recent evidence has revealed that posterior pituitary hormones can exert important actions on endocrine pancreatic function. In the present study, the presence of AVP receptors, namely Avpr1a (V1a), Avpr1b (V1b) and Avpr2 (V2) was demonstrated in murine islets as well as rodent BRIN BD11 and human 1.1B4 beta-cells. Further to this, AVP was shown to induce significant concentration-dependent (10(-12)- 10(-6) M) increases of insulin release from both rodent and human beta-cells, as well as mouse islets. Insulinotropic actions of AVP were completely annulled by specific V1a or V1b receptor antagonists, and partially abolished by an oxytocin receptor antagonist. In addition, beta-cell insulin secretory actions of AVP were augmented by both IBMX (200 mu M) and KCI (30 mM) and linked to significantly increased cAMP production and [Ca2+](i). AVP substantially increased proliferation of rodent and human beta-cells. Moreover, AVP fully protected against cytokine-induced beta-cell apoptosis. AVP had no effect on glucagon secretion. Immunohistochemical examination of beta- and alpha-cells revealed co-expression of AVP with glucagon, and particularly insulin. Finally, administration of AVP in combination with glucose to mice significantly reduced blood glucose, which was associated with increased plasma insulin. These data indicate that AVP possesses novel and potentially important effects on pancreatic endocrine function. Understanding disturbances in islet AVP receptor signalling could reveal insight into the beta-cell defects associated with diabetes.

AB Interest is rising in the agrochemical and pharmaceutical industries concerning the use of enantio-merically pure amino acids. L-Amino acids are easily produced by deracemization of D,L-mixtures or by stereoinversion of D-amino acids, employing the flavoenzyme D-amino acid oxidase. On the other hand, the production of the D-enantiomers is hampered by the lack of a suitable enzyme with reversed stereoselectivity. In recent years, the enzyme L-amino acid deaminase has been proposed as an alternative to L-amino acid oxidase. L-Amino acid deaminase from Proteus myxofaciens (PmaLAAD) is a membranebound flavoprotein that catalyzes the deamination of L-amino acids to the corresponding alpha-keto acids and ammonia without producing hydrogen peroxide since the electrons are transferred from the reduced cofactor to a b-type cytochrome. For this reason, purified PmaLAAD has no significant enzymatic activity; this can be recovered by adding exogenous E. coll. membranes. In order to circumvent the use of membranes, we analyzed the ability of PmaLAAD to use alternative electron acceptors, as well as detergents, to reproduce the hydrophobic environment. With phenazine methosulfate (PMS) and anionic detergents, at concentrations lower than the critical micellar concentration, higher enzymatic activity can be reached than with membranes. The effect on stability, protein conformation, oligomeric state and activity of temperature, pH, ionic strength, and detergents was also investigated. By optimizing the reaction conditions (namely, using 0.8 mM PMS and 0.1 mM SDS) the rate of L-leucine bioconversion was improved.

AB Evidence suggests that hydrogen sulfide precondition (HIPC) is an effective protocol in the management of ischemia reperfusion (I/R) by attenuating free radical and calcium overload in mitochondria. However the efficacy of HIPC is largely unknown in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) hearts subjected to I/R procedure.
   Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: i) normal, ii) diabetes mellitus (DM), and iii) diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). DM and DCM animals were prepared by using streptozotocin injection at the age of 4 week (35 mg/kg, i.p). DCM animals were additionally administered with high fat diet for 3 months. Isolated rat hearts were perfused by using Langendorff apparatus with continuous hemodynamic monitoring.
   Following reperfusion, cardiac physiological efficiency was highly compromised in DCM heart (high infarct size by 94% and low relative pressure product by 65%) as compared to normal rat heart. HIPC effectively improved cardiac physiology of I/R challenged normal rat hearts by 62.5% (RPP), reduced injury by 60% (Infarct size) and subsequently preserved mitochondrial electron transport chain enzyme activities NQR by 57%, membrane potential, swelling behaviour, ATP content, ATP producing capacity and oxidative defence system by reducing lipid peroxidation by 55% compared with I/R. But in DM and DCM animals, isolated hearts conditioned with HIPC substantially improved cardiac physiology (RPP) by 44% in DM and 58% in DCM, arrest tissue injury (Infarct size) by 72% in DM and 79% in DCM and preserved mitochondrial activity only to its own sham control, primarily due to the basal level defect. Furthermore, we found that SSM fraction of diabetic heart mitochondria showed overall better improvement in their function than IFM by HIPC. However, mitochondrion experienced I/R associated oxidative stress was not improved by HIPC. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB Enterococcus faecium D-aspartate ligase (Asl(fm)) is a peptide bond-forming enzyme that is involved in the peptidoglycan assembly pathway. It catalyzes the ATP-dependent ligation of the beta-carboxylate of D-Asp to the epsilon-amino group of L-Lys in the nucleotide precursor UDP- MurNAc-pentapeptide. The enzyme is of interest as a target of new, potential, narrow-spectrum antibiotics directed against multiresistant E. faecium. The kinetic mechanism of Asl(fm )has not been fully characterized. To determine it, a progress curve analysis of Asl(fm )catalytic process using pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase ATPase detection assay was performed. With an inspection of the shape of measured progress curves and the results of specific qualitative experiments, the Asl(fm )reaction mechanism was singled out. The proposed Asl(fm ) kinetics reaction scheme was evaluated by fitting the parameters of the corresponding differential equations to progress curves using the computer program ENZO. The complete kinetic analysis result is consistent with the substrate binding order 1) ATP, 2) D-Asp, and 3) UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. The analysis suggests that slowly establishing non-productive equilibria between the free and ATP-bound enzyme with the participating pentapeptide are responsible for initial reaction burst followed by a steady-state period before the complete depletion of the reactant added in the lowest concentration.

AB Osteosarcoma is one of the most malignant cancer adolescents and young adults and metastatic osteosarcoma is a huge life threat with a 5-year survival lower than 20%. However, the mechanisms through which localized osteosarcoma turned metastatic are not fully understood. Here, we studied the role of miR-204-5p in osteosarcoma and found that miR-204-5p is downregulated in both osteosarcoma patients and osteosarcoma cell lines. In addition, overexpression of miR-204-5p resulted in increase of osteosarcoma cell apoptosis and decrease of osteosarcoma cell migration and invasion. Besides, our in vivo xenograft data showed strong inhibitory role of miR-204-5p in tumor growth. Importantly, our data showed that miR-204-5p regulates the mRNA stability of Early B Cell Factor 2 (EBF2), a crucial regulator in osteosarcoma apoptosis, by directly binding to 3' UTR of EBF2. Besides, our data further revealed that overexpressed EBF2 inhibited apoptosis and facilitated migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. Additionally, EBF2 overexpression rescued the phenotype caused by miR-204-5p.Our data indicated that miR-204-5p is an anti-oncogenic miRNA in osteosarcoma which functions through inhibiting oncogenic transcription factor EBF2. These results provided new therapeutic targets for metastatic osteosarcoma and insights into molecular regulation of EBF2. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB There is a great need for fast, simple and precise diagnostic assays capable of direct quantification of biomarkers in complex biological matrices. Yet, the commonly used techniques such as ELISA/Immunoassays are tedious and involve various steps e.g. blocking, washing and signal development. Moreover, most of these assays have very limited ability of detecting small molecules and have hardly any multiplexing capabilities. The gold standard and alternative, mass-spectrometry, however, depends upon expensive hardware and is incompatible with point of care (POC) diagnostics. As opposed to POC assays for proteins or larger targets where variable formats are readily available.
   Here, we present a simple, versatile and fast one-step assay for detecting a small molecule, ethanolamine as example. The assay makes use of commonly available qPCR machines to detect target-concentration dependent shifts in the melting temperatures of aptamer beacons. The method allows detection of ethanolamine in the low nM range without requiring tedious elaboration of assay conditions as required for molecular beacons at room temperature. If generalizable, it may change the situation of small molecule assays significantly. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM). All rights reserved.

AB Nitrosomonas europaea is a chemolithotroph that obtains energy through the oxidation of ammonia to hydroxylamine while assimilates atmospheric CO2 to cover the cell carbon demands for growth. This microorganism plays a relevant role in the nitrogen biogeochemical cycle on Earth but its carbon metabolism remains poorly characterized. Based on sequence homology, we identified two genes (cbbG and gabD) coding for redox enzymes in N. europaea. Cloning and expression of the genes in Escherichia coli, allowed the production of recombinant enzymes purified to determine their biochemical properties. The protein CbbG is a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (Ga3P) dehydrogenase (Ga3PDHase) catalyzing the reversible oxidation of Ga3P to 1,3-bis-phospho-glycerate (1,3bisPGA), using specifically NAD(+)/NADH as cofactor. CbbG showed similar to 6-fold higher K-m value for 1,3bisPGA but similar to 5-fold higher k(cat) for the oxidation of Ga3P. The protein GabD irreversibly oxidizes Ga3P to 3Pglycerate using NAD(+) or NADP(+), thus resembling a non-phosphorylating Ga3PDHase. However, the enzyme showed similar to 6-fold higher K-m value and three orders of magnitude higher catalytic efficiency with succinate semialdehyde (SSA) and NADP(+). Indeed, the GabD protein identity corresponds to an SSA dehydrogenase (SSADHase). CbbG seems to be the only Ga3PDHase present in N. europaea; which would be involved in reducing triose-P during autotrophic carbon fixation. Otherwise, in cells grown under conditions deprived of ammonia and oxygen, the enzyme could catalyze the glycolytic step of Ga3P oxidation producing NADH. As an SSADHase, GabD would physiologically act producing succinate and preferentially NADPH over NADH; thus being part of an alternative pathway of the tricarboxylic acid cycle converting alpha-ketoglutarate to succinate. The properties determined for these enzymes contribute to better identify metabolic steps in CO2 assimilation, glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle in N. europaea. Results are discussed in the framework of metabolic pathways that launch biosynthetic intermediates relevant in the microorganism to develop and fulfill its role in nature.

AB Human Cripto-1 (Cripto-1), the founding member of the EGF-CFC superfamily, is a key regulator of many processes during embryonic development and oncogenesis. Cripto-1 is barely present or even absent in normal adult tissues while it is aberrantly re-expressed in various tumors. Blockade of the CFC domain-mediated Cripto-1 functions is acknowledged as a promising therapeutic intervention point to inhibit the tumorigenic activity of the protein.
   In this work, we report the generation and characterization of murine monoclonal antibodies raised against the synthetic folded CFC [112-150] domain of the human protein. Through subtractive ELISA assays clones were screened for the ability to specifically recognize "hot spot" residues on the CFC domain, which are crucial for the interaction with Activin Type I receptor (ALK4) and GRP78. On selected antibodies, SPR and epitope mapping studies have confirmed their specificity and have revealed that recognition occurs only on a conformational epitope.
   Furthermore, FACS analyses have confirmed the ability of 1B4 antibody to recognize the membrane-anchored and soluble native Cripto-1 protein in a panel of human cancer cells. Finally, we have evaluated its functional effects through in vitro cellular signaling assays and cell cycle analysis. These findings suggest that the selected anti-CFC mAbs have the potential to neutralize the protein oncogenic activity and may be used as theranostic molecules suitable as tumor homing agents for Cripto-1-overexpressing cancer cells and tissues and to overcome drug-resistance in routine cancer therapies.

AB Background: Though sphingolipids are ubiquitously present in eukaryotic cells, but until the last decade, they were merely considered as a structural component of the plasma membrane with limited function. However, over the last decade, numerous functions have been ascribed to sphingolipids after the seminal discoveries on the bioactivities of several sphingolipids.
   Scope of review: Sphingolipids are now well-recognized signals for fundamental cellular processes. Here we discussed about the advent of several sphingolipids components as potential therapeutic target for both human and plants.
   Major conclusions: Sphingolipid contents and/or sphingolipid-metabolizing enzyme expression/activity often get impaired during pathophysiological conditions, and hence manipulation of this signaling pathway may be beneficial in disease diagnosis, and the plasma concentrations can serve as an important prognostic and diagnostic marker for the disease.
   General significance: Sphingolipids are emerging as a goldmine for new therapeutic drug targets with promising new applications (cosmeceutical and nutraceutical), thereby opening new avenues for pharmaceuticals and nutraceutical industries.

AB Neoplastic cells display altered biosynthetic and bioenergetic machinery to support cell survival. Therefore, cancer cells optimally utilize all available fuel resources to pump their highly upregulated metabolic pathways. While glucose is the main carbon source, transformed cells also utilize other molecules, which can be utilized in metabolic pathways, designated as alternative fuels. Acetate is one of such alternative metabolic fuels, which is mainly consumed in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. However, studies demonstrate the contradictory effects of acetate on tumor cell survival. Moreover, the mechanisms of its antitumor actions remain poorly understood. Further, the spectrum of acetate susceptible tumor targets needs to be characterized in order to optimize the use of acetate in maneuvering tumor progression as a therapeutic strategy. As the effect of acetate on survival properties of the tumor cells of thymic origin is not worked out, in the present study the effect of acetate was investigated against tumor cells derived from a murine thymoma designated as Dalton's Lymphoma (DL). Acetate treatment of tumor cells inhibited tumor cell survival accompanied by induction of apoptotic cell death, associated with modulated expression of cell survival regulatory HIF1 alpha, ROS, p53, Caspase 3, Bax and HSP70 along with the elevated level of cytosolic cytochrome c. Acetate treatment also modulated the expression of pH regulators MCT-1 and V-ATPase accompanied by altered pH homeostasis. Expression of MDR and lipid metabolism regulatory molecules was also inhibited in tumor cells upon acetate exposure. Further, preexposure of tumor cells to alpha-CHC (alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate), an inhibitor of MCT-1, partially abrogated the cytotoxic action of acetate. These findings shed a new light regarding the effect and mechanisms of the exogenous acetate on the biology of tumor cells of thymic origin.

AB The efficiency of current antimicrobial drugs is noticeably decreasing and thus the development of new treatments is necessary. Natural and synthetic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have attracted great attention as promising candidates. Inspired on Mo-CBP3, an antimicrobial protein from Moringa oleifera seeds, we designed and synthesized three AMPs named Mo-CBP3-PepI, Mo-CBP3-PepII, and Mo-CBP3 PepIII. All these three peptides inhibited the growth of Candida species and pathogenic bacteria, penetrate into microbial cells, but none is hemolytic or toxic to human cells. Mo-CBP3-PepIII, particularly, showed the strongest antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida species, important human pathogens. Additionally, Mo-CBP3-PepIII did not exhibit hemolytic or toxic activity to mammalian cells, but increased Staphylococcus aureus plasma membrane permeabilization. In Candida parapsilosis, Mo-CBP3-PepIII induced pore formation in the plasma membrane and overproduction of reactive oxygen species. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that Mo-CBP3-PepIII is resistant to pepsin digestion and other proteolytic enzymes present in the intestinal environment, which opens the possibility of oral delivery in future treatments. Together, these results suggest that Mo-CBP3-PepIII has great potential as an antimicrobial agent against the bacterium S. aureus and the fungi C. parapsilosis.

AB G-quadruplexes (G4s) are fascinating non-canonical nucleic acid structures that attract broad attention due to their vital roles in gene expression and various applications. G4s exhibit high structural polymorphism and high resolution techniques (NMR, Crystallography) are often required to unambiguously determine G4 topology. Fast and handy techniques such as UV and CD provide interesting structural information. Here, we monitored the thermal denaturation profiles (TDPs) of various G4s at different wavelengths by UV, and confirmed that all G4 topologies (parallel, antiparallel and hybrid) exhibited hyperchromism at 243 nm and hypochromism at 295 nm. Furthermore, the absorption at 260 nm and 275 nm showed a remarkable topology-dependent behavior, and the hypochromism at 275 nm allows to discriminate parallel conformations from other G4 topologies. Therefore, this work provides a new inexpensive identification method for parallel G4 structures as well as a new perspective for the relationship between TDPs and G4 structures.

AB Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the second-most common uronephrological cancer. In the absence of specific symptoms, early diagnosis of RCC is challenging. Monitoring of the aberrant expression of tumour-associated antigens (TAAs) and related autoantibody response is considered as a novel approach of RCC diagnostics. The aim of this study was to examine the aberrant expression of arrestin-1 in renal tumours, to investigate the possible epigenetic mechanism underlying arrestin-1 expression, and to assess the frequency of anti-arrestin-1 autoantibody response. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess the presence of arrestin-1 in primary tumours and metastases of 39 patients with RCC and renal oncocytoma. Bisulfite sequencing was employed to analyse the methylation status of the promoter of the SAG gene encoding arrestin-1. Western blot analysis was performed to detect autoantibodies against arrestin-1 in serum samples of 36 RCC and oncocytoma patients. Arrestin-1 was found to be expressed in RCC (58.7% of cases) and renal oncocytoma (90% of cases) cells, while being absent in healthy kidney. The expression of arrestin-1 in RCC metastases was more prominent than in primary tumours. Hypo-methylation of the SAG gene promoter is unlikely to be the mechanism for the aberrant expression of arrestin-1. Autoantibodies against arrestin-1 were detected in sera of 75% of RCC patients. Taken together, our findings suggest employment of autoantibody against arrestin-1 as biomarker of RCC. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB Viruses are considered as natural nanomaterials as they are in the size range of 20-500 nm with a genetical material either DNA or RNA, which is surrounded by a protein coat capsid. Recently, the field of virus nanotechnology is gaining significant attention from researchers. Attention is given to the utilization of viruses as nanomaterials for medical, biotechnology and energy applications. Removal of genetic material from the viral capsid creates empty capsid for drug incorporation and coating the capsid protein crystals with antibodies, enzymes or aptamers will enhance their targeted drug deliver efficiency. Studies reported that these virus-like nanoparticles have been used in delivering drugs for cancer. It is also used in imaging and sensory applications for various diseases. However, there is reservation among researchers to utilize virus-like nanoparticles in targeted delivery of genes in gene therapy, as there is a possibility of using virus-like nanoparticles for targeted gene delivery. In addition, other biomedical applications that are explored using virus-like nanoparticles and the probable mechanism of delivering genes.

AB Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age and has a prevalence of 1 in 15 women worldwide. This study aims to investigate the role of lncRNA SRA in the pathological processes of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
   Methods: Twenty five-day old female C57BL/6 mice received subcutaneous injection of 60 mg/kg dehydroepiandrosterone for 20 days to induce PCOS. Lentivirus containing lncRNA SRA-specific shRNA was subcapsularly injected into the ovaries of PCOS mice. Granulosa cell was primary cultured to explore the mechanism of DHEA-induced inflammatory responses. H&E staining was used to examine the histological changes of ovaries. ELISA was used to assess serum insulin level and proinflammatory cytokines and angiogenetic factors contents in ovary tissue. The expression levels of LncRNA SRA and proteins involved in the NF-kappa B signaling pathway were detected through Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. The nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B was observed by immunofluorescence and the activity of NF-kappa B-DNA binding was detected using EMSA.
   Results: Silencing of lncRNA SRA changed insulin release, attenuated ovary injury and reduced the production of angiogenetic factors in the PCOS mice. In addition, shRNA targeting lncRNA SRA inhibited DHEA-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines production and NF-kappa B nuclear translocation in the ovary of PCOS mice and primary granulosa cells.
   Conclusion: Silencing of lncRNA Steroid Receptor RNA Activator (SRA) attenuates polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in mice. LncRNA SRA plays important roles in the development of PCOS. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM). All rights reserved.

AB One of the sweetest proteins found in tropical fruits (with a threshold of 50 nM), thaumatin, is also used commercially as a sweetener. Our previous study successfully produced the sweetest thaumatin mutant (D21N), designated hyper-sweet thaumatin, which decreases the sweetness threshold to 31 nM. To investigate why the D21N mutant is sweeter than wild-type thaumatin, we compared the structure of the D21N mutant solved at a subatomic resolution of 0.93 angstrom with that of wild-type thaumatin determined at 0.90 angstrom. Although the overall structure of the D21N mutant resembles that of wild-type thaumatin, our subatomic resolution analysis successfully assigned and discriminated the detailed atomic positions of side-chains at position 21. The relative B-factor value of the side-chain at position 21 in the D21N mutant was higher than that of wild-type thaumatin, hinting at a greater flexibility of side-chain at 21 in the hyper-sweet D21N mutant. Furthermore, alternative conformations of Lys19, which is hydrogen-bonded to Asp21 in wild-type, were found only in the D21N mutant. Subatomic resolution analysis revealed that flexible conformations at the sites adjacent to positions 19 and 21 play a crucial role in enhancing sweet potency and may serve to enhance the complementarity of electrostatic potentials for interaction with the sweet taste receptor.

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common forms of solid tumors in the world with high rates of mortality and morbidity. Most cases of CRCs are initiated by inactivating mutations in a tumor suppressor gene, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), leading to constitutive activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. This review summarizes the roles of somatic and germline mutations of the APC gene in hereditary as well as sporadic forms of CRC. We also discuss the diagnostic and prognostic value of the APC gene in the pathogenesis of CRC for a better understanding of CRC disease.

AB The piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, mostly 24-32 nucleotides in length. The piRNAs are not known to have any conserved secondary structure or sequence motifs. Using bioinformatics analysis, we discovered the presence of putative G-quadruplex (GQ) forming sequences in human piRNAs. We studied human piR-48164/piR-GQ containing a potential GQ forming sequence and using biochemical and biophysical techniques confirmed its ability to form a GQ. Using EMSA, we discovered that the formation of GQ structure led to inhibition of the piRNA binding to the HIWI-PAZ domain as well as the complementary base pairing to a target RNA. The inability of the piR-GQ to interact with the PIWI protein might be detrimental to the function of the piRNA. To investigate if the formation of a GQ structure in piRNA prevents its target gene silencing in vivo, we used a reporter assay. The piR-GQ failed to inhibit the reporter gene expression while a mutated version that lacked the ability to form GQ inhibited reporter gene expression indicating that the presence of GQ in piRNA is detrimental to its function. These studies unraveled the dependence of a piRNA's functionality on an RNA secondary structure and added a new layer of regulation to their function.

AB Osteoporosis has been attributed to low bone mass arising from cellular communications between bone formation and bone resorption. Osteoclastogenesis is induced by M-CSF and RANKL in hematopoietic lineage cells. Once RANK/RANKL complex is formed, TRAF6 is recruited and triggers the activation of NF-kappa B pathway and the expression of osteoclast-related genes including NFATc1. Neotuberostemonine (NTS) is an active compound isolated from Stemona tuberosa Lour. Pharmacologically, NTS has been known to possess antitussive, anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory activities through regulation of macrophage. However, the influence of NTS to osteoclastogenesis has not been reported. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether NTS can modulate the osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL or cancer cells. We found that NTS inhibits RANKL- or cancer cell-mediated osteoclastogenesis via blockade of TRAF6 and NF-kappa B activation. NTS also impairs the formation of F-actin ring structure, an important feature of osteoclast differentiation and function. These results indicate that NTS can be a preventive and therapeutic candidate for bone-related disease and that NTS provides insights underlying molecular mechanisms that influence osteoclastogenesis.

AB Short upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are the most prevalent cis-acting regulatory elements in the mammalian transcriptome which can orchestrate mRNA translation. Apart from being "passive roadblocks" that decrease expression of the main coding regions, particular uORFs can serve as specific sensors for changing conditions, thus regulating translation in response to cell stress. Here we report a novel uORF-based regulatory mechanism that is employed under conditions of hyperosmotic stress by at least two human mRNAs, coding for translation reinitiation/recycling factor eIF2D and E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2. This novel mode of translational control selectively downregulates their expression and requires as few as one uORF. Using a set of reporter mRNAs and fleeting mRNA transfection (FLERT) technique, we provide evidence that the phenomenon does not rely on delayed reinitiation, altered AUG recognition, ribosome stalling, mRNA destabilization or other known mechanisms. Instead, it is based on events taking place at uORF stop codon or immediately downstream. Functional aspects and implications of the novel regulatory mechanism to cell physiology are discussed.

AB This study is designed to explore the mechanism by which long non-coding RNA (IncRNA) antisense non-coding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL) plays a pathogenic role in uric acid nephropathy (UAN). The expressions of ANRIL, miR-122-5p, BRCAl-BRCA2-containing complex subunit 3 (BRCC3) and NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) were determined in UAN patients and uric acid-treated HK-2 cells by qRT-PCR. Protein levels of BRCC3 and NLRP3 were examined by western blot. The levels of inflammatory cytokines were quantified by ELISA. CCK-8 assay was used to assess cell viability. Apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-FITC/PI double-labeled flow cytometry and TUNEL assay. The interaction between ANRIL, miR-122-5p and BRCC3 were studied using luciferase reporter assay. The role of ANRIL in renal injury was evaluated in experimental rats. ANRIL and BRCC3 were highly expressed while miR-122-5p was down-regulated in serum of UAN patients and uric acid-treated tubular epithelial cells. Luciferase reporter assay and in vitro rescue experiment confirmed that ANRIL promoted NLRP3 inflammasome activation by up-regulating BRCC3 expression via sponging miR-122-5p. Furthermore, in vivo experiment validated that knockdown of ANRIL alleviated renal injury of UAN rats. ANRIL exerted pathogenic effect in UAN to promote NLRP3 inflammasome activation via miR-122-5p/BRCC3 axis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB The high prevalence of lung cancer (LC) has triggered the search of biomarkers for early diagnosis of this disease. For this purpose the study of metabolic changes related to the development of lung cancer could provide interesting information about its early diagnosis. In this sense, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a disease associated with tumor development, is a comorbidity that increases the risk of onset and progression of lung neoplasia and has also to be considered in the study of pathology related to lung cancer. This work develop a metabolomic approach based on direct infusion mass spectrometry using a hybrid triple quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer (DI-ESI-QqQ-TOF-MS) in order to identify altered metabolites from serum of LC and COPD patients and evaluate its relationship and implication in the progression of LC. This methodology has been applied to 30 serum samples from LC, 30 healthy patients used as controls (HC) and 30 serum samples from COPD to found altered metabolites from both LC and COPD diseases. In addition, some metabolic differences and similarities were found in Pulmonary Emphysema and Chronic Bronchitis patients. On the other hand, altered metabolites were studied in different stages of LC (II, III and IV) to evaluate the perturbation of them throughout the progression of disease. The sample treatment consisted of the extraction of polar and non-polar metabolites from serum that was later infused into the mass spectrometer using an electrospray ionization source in positive and negative mode. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) allowed a classification between LC, HC and COPD groups in all acquisition modes. A total of 35 altered and common metabolites between LC and COPD, including amino acids, fatty acids, lysophospholipids, phospholipids and triacylglycerides were identified, being alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism the most altered. Finally, ROC curves were applied to the dataset and metabolites with ADC value higher than 0.70 were considered as relevant in the progression of LC. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The dexA gene encoding Penicillium funiculosum dextranase (GenBank accession MH581385) belonging to family 49 of glycoside hydrolases (GH49) was cloned and heterologously expressed in two recipient strains, P. canescens RN3-11-7 and P. verruculosum B1-537. Crude enzyme preparations with the recombinant dextranase content of 8-36% of the total secreted protein were obtained on the basis of new Penicillium strains. Both recombinant forms of the dextranase were isolated in a homogeneous state using chromatographic techniques. The purified enzymes displayed very similar properties, that is, pl 4.55, activity optima at pH 4.5-5.0 and 55-60 degrees C and a melting temperature of 60.7-60.9 degrees C. They were characterized by similar specific activities (1020-1340 U/mg) against dextrans with a mean molecular mass of 20, 70 and 500 kDa, as well as similar kinetic parameters in the hydrolysis of 70 kDa dextran (K-m = 1.10-1.11 g/L, k(cat) = 640-680 s(-1)). However, the recombinant dextranases expressed in P. canescens and P. verruculosum had different molecular masses according to the data of SDS-PAGE (similar to 63 and similar to 60 kDa, respectively); this was the result of different N-glycosylation patterns as MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis showed. The main products of dextran hydrolysis at its initial phase were isomaltooligosaccharides, while after the prolonged time (24 h) the reaction system contained isomaltose and glucose as the major products and minor amounts of other oligosaccharides.

AB Lipid membranes have an essential role in most physiological processes including cell protection, cell-tocell communication and regulation of intracellular signaling. These multiple roles of biological membranes prompted the study and the development of artificial lipid membranes with the primary aim to reconstitute the natural functions in vitro and understand the interaction between all membrane components at the molecular level. Tethered bilayer lipid membranes (tBLMs) are emerging as the ideal experimental platform for functional and structural studies on membrane-associated proteins due to their peculiar properties such as their stability and fluidity of both leaflets in the phospholipid bilayer. tBLMs have been used in many studies, ranging from the analysis of membrane structure and function, studies of the membrane-protein and membrane-peptide interactions, as well as applications as biosensors and energy generating devices. This review describes all the uses of tBLMs as a tool to investigate biological functions, pointing out limitations of this methodology and future applications once optimization of the technique will be achieved.

AB Binding of indoloquinolines with different aliphatic side chains to a parallel G-quadruplex derived from the MYC promoter sequence was characterized by optical and calorimetric measurements. ITC experiments performed at different temperatures enabled the determination of molar heat capacity changes upon quadruplex binding and a partitioning of the total binding free enthalpy into contributing terms with hydrophobic effects being major driving forces for all derivatives. Whereas affinities increase for indoloquinolines equipped with a long and positively charged side arm, the highest contribution of specific intermolecular interactions anticipated to impart enhanced specificity is found for a ligand with an uncharged ether aliphatic tail. Obtained thermodynamic signatures may considerably aid in the rational selection of ligand side chains for G-quadruplex binders with enhanced affinity or selectivity.

AB PA1 (dIm-PyPy beta PyPyPy-gamma-PyPy beta PyPyPyPy beta-Ta) is a large (14-ring) hairpin polyamide that was designed to recognize the DNA sequence 5'-W(2)GW(7)-3', where W is either A or T. As is common among the smaller 6-8-ring hairpin polyamides (PAs), it binds its target recognition sequence with low nM affinity. However, in addition to its large size, it is distinct from these more extensively characterized PAs in its high tolerance for mismatches and antiviral properties. In ongoing attempts to understand the basis for these distinctions, we conducted thermodynamics studies of PA1-DNA interactions. The temperature dependence of binding affinity was measured using TAMRA-labeled hairpin DNAs containing a single target sequence. PA1 binding to either an ATAT/TATA or an AAAA/TTTT pattern is consistently entropically driven. This is in contrast to the A/T pattern-dependent driving forces for DNA binding by netropsin, distamycin, and smaller hairpin polyamides. Analysis of the salt dependence of PAl-DNA binding reveals that within experimental error, there is no dependence on ionic strength, indicating that the polyelectrolyte effect does not contribute to PAL-DNA binding energetics. This is similar to that observed for smaller PAs. PA1-DNA recognition sequence binding stoichiometries were determined at both nM (fluorescence) and mu M (circular dichroism) concentrations. With all sequences and under both conditions, multiple PA1 molecules bind the small DNA hairpin that contains only a single recognition sequence. Implications for these observations are discussed.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Apoptotic endonucleases act cooperatively to fragment DNA and ensure the irreversibility of apoptosis. However, very little is known regarding the potential regulatory links between endonucleases. Deoxyribonuclease 1 (DNase I) inactivation is caused by alternative splicing (AS) of DNase I pre-mRNA skipping exon 4, which occurs in response to EndoG overexpression in cells. The current study aimed to determine the role of EndoG in the regulation of DNase I mRNA AS and the modulation of its enzymatic activity. A strong correlation was identified between the EndoG expression levels and DNase I splice variants in human lymphocytes. EndoG overexpression in CD4(+) T cells down-regulated the mRNA levels of the active full-length DNase I variant and up-regulated the levels of the non-active spliced variant, which acts in a dominant-negative fashion. DNase I AS was induced by the translocation of EndoG from mitochondria into nuclei during the development of apoptosis. The DNase I spliced variant was induced by recombinant EndoG or by incubation with EndoG-digested cellular RNA in an in vitro system with isolated cell nuclei. Using antisense DNA oligonucleotides, we identified a 72-base segment that spans the adjacent segments of exon 4 and intron 4 and appears to be responsible for the AS. DNase I-positive CD4(+) T cells overexpressing EndoG demonstrated decreased progression towards bleomycin-induced apoptosis. Therefore, EndoG is an endonuclease with the unique ability to inactivate another endonuclease, DNase I, and to modulate the development of apoptosis.

AB Kissing loop interactions (KLIs) are a common motif that is critical in retroviral dimerization, viroid replication, mRNA, and riboswitches. In addition, KLIs are currently used in a variety of biotechnology applications, such as in aptamer sensors, RNA scaffolds and to stabilize vaccines for therapeutics. Here we describe the thermodynamics of a basic intramolecular DNA capable of engaging in a KLI, consisting of two hairpins connected by a flexible linker. Each hairpin loop has a five-nucleotide complementary sequence theoretically capable of engaging in a KLI. On either side of each loop is two thymines which will not engage in kissing but are present to provide more flexibility and optimal KLI positioning. Our results suggest that the KLI occurs even at physiological salt levels, and that the KLI does not alter the thermodynamics and stability of the two stem structures. The KLI does not involve all five nucleotides, or at least each base-pair stack is not making full contact. Adding a second strand complementary to the bottom of the kissing complex removes flexibility and causes destabilization of the stems. The KLI of this less flexible complex is maintained but the T-M is reduced, indicating an entopic penalty to its formation.

AB Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are frequently implicated in various cancers. However, the significances of lncRNAs in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) are largely unclear. In this study, we identified a novel lncRNA nasopharyngeal carcinoma copy number amplified transcript-1 (NPCCAT1), whose expression is increased in NPC tissues compared with nasopharyngeal normal tissues. Furthermore, we found the genomic copy number of NPCCAT1 is amplified in NPC, which contributes to the upregulation of NPCCAT1 in NPC. Functional experiments demonstrated that overexpression of NPCCAT1 promotes NPC cell growth and migration in vitro and NPC tumor growth in vivo. Knockdown of NPCCAT1 suppresses NPC cell grow and migration. Mechanistically, we found that NPCCAT1 directly binds YY1 mRNA 5'UTR, promotes YY1 mRNA translation, and upregulates YY1 protein level. Gain-of-function and loss-offunction assays revealed that YY1 promoted NPC cell proliferation and migration. Moreover, rescue assays showed that depletion of YY1 attenuated the roles of NPCCAT1 overexpression in promoting NPC cell growth and migration in vitro and NPC tumor growth in vivo. Overall, our study identified NPCCAT1 as an oncogenic lncRNA which promotes NPC progression via upregulating YY1, and suggested that lncRNA NPCCAT1 may be a promising therapeutic target for NPC.

AB Antimicrobial peptides are one of the promising substitutes for conventional antibiotics. To examine their potential usefulness for controlling bacterial infections, the present study aimed to determine the induction of the self-destruction of Escherichia coli mediated by bac8c, which was modified from template peptide bactenecin. The potential of bac8c (RIWVIWRR) was reflected by the change in physiological following exposure, which led to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with an imbalance in the antioxidant system and damage to the intracellular lipids. In addition, bac8c-mediated death exhibited typical features to bacterial apoptosis-like death (ALD). The pathway was not enhanced in the absence of autocleavage of RecA and LexA, the SOS response proteins. We observed that elevated levels of intracellular ROS induced ALD, but this effect was insufficient before preceding RecA activation and LexA autocleavage. Furthermore, dinF, which encodes a member of the toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family, was evaluated to examine the role of the ALD pathway. dinF protein was required to accelerate the ALD-mediated bac8c in combination with RecA. Taken together, bac8c-mediated cell death underlies the severe SOS response, leading to RecA activation, LexA proteolysis, and dinF overexpression. Since then, overproduction of intracellular ROS facilitated the cell death. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM). All rights reserved.

AB Biocarriers are pivotal in enhancing the reusability of biocatalyst that would otherwise be less economical for industrial application. Ever since the induction of enzymatic technology, varied materials have been assessed for their biocompatibility with enzymes of distinct functionalities. Herein, cellulase was immobilized onto polymethacrylate particles (ICP) as the biocarrier grafted with ethylenediamine (EDA) and glutaraldehyde (GA). Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) was used as a model substrate for activity assay. Enzyme immobilization loading was determined by quantifying the dry weight differential of ICP (pre-& post-immobilization). Cellulase was successfully demonstrated to be anchored upon ICP and validated by FTIR spectra analysis. The optimal condition for cellulase immobilization was determined to be pH 6 at 20 degrees C. The maximum CMCase activity was achieved at pH 5 and 50 degrees C. Residual activity of similar to 50% was retained after three iterations and dipped to similar to 18% on following cycle. Also, ICP displayed superior pH adaptability as compared to free cellulase. The specific activity of ICP was 65.14 +/- 1.11% relative to similar amount of free cellulase.

AB Nucleic acid aptamers are promising recognition ligands for diagnostic applications. They are short DNA or RNA molecules isolated from large random libraries through the Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX) procedure. These molecules, with a particular three-dimensional shape, bind to a wide range of targets from small molecules to whole cells with high affinity and specificity. The unique properties of nucleic acid aptamers including high binding affinity and specificity, thermostability, ease of chemical production, ease of chemical modification, target adaptability, simple storage, resistance to denaturation, low immunogenicity, and low cost make them potential diagnostic tools for clinical use. Colorectal cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in humans and the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the world. Due to low response rate to current therapies in advanced stages of the disease, early detection of CRC can be useful in disease management. This review highlights recent advances in the development of nucleic acid aptamer-based methods for diagnosis, prognosis, and theranosis of colorectal cancer.

AB Of four naturally occurring frenatin peptides tested, frenatin 2D (DLLGTLGNLPLPFI.NH2) from Discoglossus sardus was the most potent and effective in producing concentration-dependent stimulation of insulin release from BRIN-BD11 rat clonal beta-cells without displaying cytotoxicity. The peptide also stimulated insulin release from 1.1B4 human-derived clonal beta-cells and isolated mouse islets and improved glucose tolerance concomitant with increased circulating insulin concentrations in mice following intraperitoneal administration. The insulinotropic activity of frenatin 2D was not associated with membrane depolarization or an increase in intracellular [Ca2+] but incubation of the peptide (1 mu M) with BRIN-BD11 cells produced a modest, but significant (P < 0.05), increase in cAMP production. Stimulation of insulin release was abolished in protein kinase A-downregulated cells but maintained in protein kinase C-downregulated cells. Circular dichroism studies showed that, in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine micelles, frenatin 2D exhibited a helical content of 35% and a turn content of 28%. Substitution of the Thr(5), Asn(8), Pro(10), and Ile(14) residues in frenatin-2D by Trp and interchange of Pro(12) and Phe(13) led to loss of insulinotropic activity but the [D1W] and [G7W] analogues were as potent and effective as the native peptide. Frenatin 2D (1 mu M) also stimulated proliferation of BRIN-BD11 cells and provided significant protection of the cells against cytokine-induced apoptosis. It is concluded that the insulinotropic activity of frenatin 2D is mediated predominantly, if not exclusively, by the K-ATP channel-independent pathway.

AB Bacterial 5' untranslated regions of mRNA, termed thermal switches or thermometers, change their structure in response to temperature change. This structural change provides for the regulation of gene expression. One of such thermal switches, called fourU, is present in the Salmonella species. Mutations of fourU were found to abrogate its regulatory properties. We investigated the thermodynamics of the fourU fragment responsible for its structural changes. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations at various temperatures and spectroscopic experiments in solution were performed for the wild-type fourU and its mutants. We found that the U11C and A8C mutations stabilize the fourU structure in comparison to the wild-type fourU, and the double-point G14A/C25U mutant has the most destabilizing effect on the fourU hairpin 2 responsible for temperature sensing. The G14A/C25U mutant is also the easiest to strand-invade by a complementary oligonucleotide as indicated by fluorescence spectroscopy experiments.

   restoring the anti-inflammatory and anti-senescent heat shock response

AB Unhealthy lifestyle persistently feeds forward inflammation in metabolic organs thus imposing senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), as observed in obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, SASP blocks physiological resolution of inflammation by suppressing the anti-inflammatory and anti-senescent heat shock (HS) response, i.e., the gene program centered in heat shock factor-1 (HSF1)-dependent expression heat shock proteins (HSPs). As SASP-inducing factors are not removed, leading to the perpetuation of inflammation, we argued that SIRT1-HSF1-HSP axis might also be suppressed in atherosclerosis, which could be reversible by heat treatment (HT), the most powerful HS response trigger. LDLr-/- adult mice were fed on high-fat/high-cholesterol diet from the age of 90 days until the end of study (age of 270 days). After 120 days under atherosclerotic diet, the animals were submitted to either whole-body HT (n = 42; 40 degrees C) or sham (n = 59; 37 degrees C) treatment (15 min/session), under anesthesia, once a week, for 8 weeks, being echographically and metabolically monitored. Aortic expressions of SIRT1, HSF1, HSP27, HSP72 and HSP73 were progressively depressed in atherosclerotic animals, as compared to normal (LDLr+/+; n = 25) healthy counterparts, which was paralleled by increased expression of NF-kappa B-dependent VCAM1 adhesion molecule. Conversely, HT completely reversed suppression of the above HS response proteins, while markedly inhibiting both VCAM1 expression and NF-kappa B DNA-binding activity. Also, HT dramatically reduced plasma levels of TG, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, oxidative stress, fasting glucose and insulin resistance while rising HDL-cholesterol levels. HT also decreased body weight gain, visceral fat, cellular infiltration and aortic fatty streaks, and heart ventricular congestive hypertrophy, thereby improving aortic blood flow and myocardial performance (Tei) indices. Remarkably, heat-treated mice stopped dying after the third HT session (= 8 human years), suggesting a curative effect. Therefore, evolution of atherosclerosis is associated with suppression of the anti-inflammatory and anti-senescent SIRT1-HSF1-HSP molecular axis, which is refreshed by chronic heat treatment.

AB Extracellular Hsp70 (eHsp70) can activate immune cells via Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4, and induce cytokine synthesis. The aim of this study was to explore inflammation-associated effects of eHsp70 alone and in combination with cigarette smoke extract (CSE) in primary bronchial epithelial cells.
   We assessed IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations, TLR2, TLR4 and Hsp70 mRNA expressions, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) activation induced by recombinant human (rh) Hsp70, CSE or their combinations in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) obtained commercially, and primary bronchial epithelial cells isolated from non-COPD lung donors (PBEC) or COPD patients (PBEC COPD).
   Baseline levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly higher in PBEC COPD than in non-COPD PBECs. Upon rhHsp70 stimulation, IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly increased, with the strongest response in COPD-derived PBECs. CSE alone elevated cytokine secretion in all examined cells. rhHsp70 and CSE had antagonistic interactions on IL-8 release in PBECs from COPD patients, while the addition of rhHsp70 further increased CSE-induced IL-6 secretion in NHBE cells. rhHsp70 and CSE alone decreased TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA expression in COPD-derived PBECs. In non-COPD PBECs, combined treatments decreased only TLR2 mRNA expression. Hsp70 mRNA expression, as indicator of intracellular Hsp70, which may have anti-inflammatory effects, was reduced in COPD-derived cells upon exposure to CSE and rhHsp70 alone, but not with their combinations. Contrary to this, in PBECs from lung donors only combined treatments supressed Hsp70 gene expression. CSE activated JNK and p38 MAPKs, while rhHsp70 increased activation of c-Jun kinase in NHBE cells.
   Collectively, both eHsp70 and CSE induce pro-inflammatory responses in PBECs from non-COPD as well as COPD donors, but in combination antagonistic effects were observed in COPD-derived cells. These effects may be related to the regulation of TLR2/4 and might lead to modulation of inflammation with possible deleterious consequences for COPD patients.

AB Cardiac injury is a dangerous disease and become a greater issue in the forthcoming decades. The ultimate goal is to prevent the progression of heart failure and apoptotic processes. Cardiac tissue may regenerate itself but to certain extent depending on the number of resident stem cells that is limited. Thus, research had been focused on bone marrow derived stem cells (BM-MSCs) as a promising therapy in different types of tissues, including the heart. This study is designed not only to assess the therapeutic effect of BM-MSCs but also to improve their therapeutic effect in combination with antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) and antihypertensive therapeutic drug form (AP) against isoproterenol-induced cardiac injury and compared with that of BM-MSCs alone. Cardiac injury was induced in 70 male rats by Isoproterenol (ISO was injected s.c. for four consecutive days). Experimental animals were divided into six ISO-treated groups beside a control non treated one. The six ISO-treated groups were divided into: ISO group, ISO+BM-MSCs group, ISO+ALA group, ISO+AP group, ISO+ALA+AP group and ISO+ALA+AP+BM-MSCs group, the last five groups were treated with the examined materials after one week of ISO injection. Isoproterenol significantly increased serum CK-MB, LDH activities, Troponin1 and TNF-alpha. Oxidative stress is evidenced by the increased MDA, NO and Caspase-3 activity associated with significant reduction of GSH content and SOD activity in cardiac tissue. Furthermore, mRNA expression of NF kappa B and iNOS were significantly up regulated and eNOS mRNA expression was down regulated. Administration of BM-MSCs, ALA and AP alone significantly mitigated the induced cardiac injury. Concomitant administration of ALA and AP after BM-MSCs induced a more pronounced improving effect on cardiac functions. In conclusion, the concomitant administration of ALA and AP after BM-MSCs infusion increases the cellular antioxidant levels of cardiac tissue that improves the repairing function of BM-MSCs.

AB Oral cancer being one of the lethal cancers is generally detected at advanced stages and causes significant mortality world over. The unavailability of the reliable biomarkers and therapeutic targets/agents forms a bottleneck in the treatment of oral cancer. MicroRNAs are considered of immense therapeutic potential for the treatment of cancer. Consistently, in this study the role and therapeutic potential of miR-650 was explored in oral cancer. The analysis of miR-650 expression by qRT-PCR revealed significant (p < 0.05) upregulation of miR-650 in oral cancer cell lines. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometery revealed that suppression of miR-650 significantly (p < 0.05) inhibits the proliferation of the SCC-25 cells by prompting Sub-G1 cell cycle arrest. Further, miR-650 suppression also inhibited the migration and invasion of the SCC-25 oral cancer cells as revealed by transwell assays. TargetScan analysis showed that miR-650 targets Growth factor independent 1 (Gfi1). Moreover, the results of western blot analysis showed that miR-650 suppression inhibits the expression of Gfi1. Interestingly, suppression of Gill exhibited similar effects on cell proliferation, migration and invasion of the oral cancer cells as that of miR-650 suppression. Nonetheless, miR-650 promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of the SCC-25 cells by upregulating the expression of Gfi1. Moreover, overexpression of miR-650 could not rescue the effects of Gill silencing on SCC-25 oral cancer cells. Conversely, overexpression of Gfi1 could rescue the effects of miR-650 inhibition on SCC-25 cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Additionally, miR-650 suppression could also inhibit the xenografted tumor growth in vivo by inhibiting the expression of Gfi1. Taken together, miR-650 may prove to be an important therapeutic target for the management of oral cancers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB MazEF and MqsRA are toxin-antitoxin systems, where the toxins MazF and MqsR sequence-specifically cleave single-stranded RNA, thereby shutting down protein synthesis and cell growth. However, it has been proposed that MazF functions in a highly specific pathway, where it truncates the 5' ends of a set of E. coli. transcripts (the MazF regulon), which are then translated under stress conditions by specialized ribosomes. We mapped the cleavage sites of MazF and MqsR throughout the E. coli. transcriptome. Our results show that both toxins cleave mRNA independently of the recognition site position and MazF freely cleaves transcripts of the proposed MazF regulon within coding sequences. Proteome analysis indicated that MazF expression leads to overall inhibition of protein synthesis and the putative MazF regulon proteins are not selectively synthesized in response to the toxin. Our results support a simpler role for endoribonuclease TA systems as indifferent destroyers of unstructured RNA.

AB There is a putative precursor to mature receptor relationship between 37 Laminin Receptor (LR) and 67 LR. As such, the pair are frequently referred to as a single entity, the 37/67 kDa Laminin Receptor (37/67 LR) and 67 LR was identified as a laminin binding entity. 37/67 LR has been of clinical interest for many years, as 37/67 LR is a prognostic indicator for many cancers including breast, lung, colon, and prostate. However, the genesis of 67 LR is controversial, and confounded by its stability under SDS-PAGE conditions, a lack of splice variants, and the existence of post-translational modifications that cannot account for the mass discrepancy between 37 and 67 LR. In the present work, we mutated potential SUMO motif sites (Lysine residues) in 37 LR and generated a series of 37 LR-expressing plasmids with a C-terminal histidine tag. We report an inability to detect 67 LR formation, suggesting that SUMOylation does not appear to directly occur at the lysine residues proposed. However, the work revealed that these lysine mutations still appear to be important and can impact the fate and function of 37 LR, by impairing half-life and steady state pre-mRNA levels. These results suggest that the Lys residues within putative SUMO motifs of 37 LR are important for 37 LR function. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Aspirin (ASP) and pioglitazone (PGL) are the most common drugs that are widely used by diabetic patients to control the blood sugar and hinder cardiovascular diseases. The interaction between PGL and ASP is one of the important medical issues to clarify the safety of co-administration of these drugs. In the present study, the effect of co-administered ASP with PGL was investigated on the structure and catalytic function of catalase as a potential target in the liver. Based on our data, co-administration of ASP-PGL significantly enhanced the catalase activity in comparison with PGL alone. However, ASP does not have any effects on the catalytic function of catalase. Moreover, the dialysis measurement and CD spectroscopy study revealed that binding of ASP to catalase could increase the stability of catalase-PGL complex. Based on the obtained data, it is shown that the binding of ASP to catalase led to increase the affinity of catalase to PGL. Binding analysis showed that the association constant of catalase-PGL was reduced considerably in the presence of ASP from 12.19 +/- 0.1 x 10(6) M-1 to 6.4 +/- 0.2 x 10(6) M-1 at 298 K. Multiple ligands simultaneous docking (MLSD) also confirmed an increase in the binding affinity of PGL to catalase.

AB Sticholysin I and II (Sts: St I and St II) are proteins of biomedical interest that form pores upon the insertion of their N-terminus in the plasma membrane. Peptides spanning the N-terminal residues of StI (StI(1-31)) or StII (StII(1-30)) can mimic the permeabilizing ability of these toxins, emerging as candidates to rationalize their potential biomedical applications. These peptides have different activities that correlate with their hydrophobicity. However, it is not clear how this property contributes to peptide folding in solution or upon binding to membranes. Here we compared the conformational properties of these peptides and shorter versions lacking the hydrophobic segment 1-11 of StI (StI(12-31)) or 1-10 of StII (StII(11-30)). Folding of peptides was assessed in solution and in membrane mimetic systems and related with their ability to bind to membranes and to permeabilize lipid vesicles. Our results suggest that the differences in activity among peptides could be ascribed to their different folding propensity and different membrane binding properties. In solution, StII(1-30) tends to acquire a-helical conformation coexisting with self-associated structures, while StI(1-31) remains structureless. Both peptides fold as ahelix in membrane; but StII(1-30) also self-associates in the lipid environment, a process that is favored by its higher affinity for membrane. We stress the contribution of the non-polar/polar balance of the 1-10 amino acid sequence of the peptides as a determining factor for different self-association capabilities. Such difference in hydrophobicity seems to determine the molecular path of peptides folding upon binding to membranes, with an impact in their permeabilizing activity. This study contributes to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the permeabilizing activity of Sts N-terminal derived peptides, with connotation for the exploitation of these small molecules as alternative of the fulllength toxins in clinical settings.

AB Frataxin plays a key role in cellular iron homeostasis of different organisms. It is engaged in several activities at the Fe-S cluster assembly machinery and it is also involved in heme biosynthesis. In plants, two genes encoding ferrochelatases (FC1 and FC2) catalyze the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin IX in the last stage of heme synthesis in chloroplasts. Despite ferrochelatases are absent from other cell compartments, a remaining ferrochelatase activity has been observed in plant mitochondria. Here we analyze the possibility that frataxin acts as the iron donor to protoporphyrin IX for the synthesis of heme groups in plant mitochondria. Our findings show that frataxin catalyzes the formation of heme in vitro when it is incubated with iron and protoporphyrin IX. When frataxin is combined with AtNFS1 and AtISD11 the ferrochelatse activity is increased. These results suggest that frataxin could be the iron donor in the final step of heme synthesis in plant mitochondria, and constitutes an important advance in the elucidation of the mechanisms of heme synthesis in plants.

AB Giardia duodenalis is a flagellated unicellular eukaryotic microorganism that usually parasitizes the small intestine of humans and many other vertebrates causing diarrheal disease throughout the world. Notably, Giardia despite minimization of most cellular systems shows different strategies to adapt to environmental conditions, evade the immune system and resist exposure to antimicrobial agents. Over the past years, epigenetic regulation of gene expression has been shown to have a relevant role in the parasite's biology. Interestingly, analysis of the Giardia genome revealed the presence of enzymes responsible for post-translational modification in histones, therefore suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms may regulate gene expression in this parasite. Thus, the purpose of this review is to summarize how epigenetic mechanisms play relevant roles in the pathogenicity of Giardia, with a particular emphasis on the molecular mechanisms associated with parasite differentiation, antigenic variation and antimicrobial resistance.

AB Paeonol is a natural phenolic compound in Moutan Cortex with multiple biological functions, such as anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activity. Recent evidence has proven that persistent inflammation, oxidative stress, along with nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling dysfunction in periodontium are the possible causes of alveolar bone resorption, and ultimately lead to periodontitis. The present study was designed to explore the protective effects of paeonol on ligation-induced periodontitis in rats, and investigate the possible mechanism. We found that treatment with paeonol (40, 80 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) for 7 days remarkably decreased the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand increased the expression of osteoprotegrin and inhibited the formation of osteoclasts. This function of paeonol might be correlated with its ability to reduce inflammatory factors (IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) and alleviate oxidative stress (SOD, MDA, GSH and ROS) in gingival tissues. Besides, paeonol increased Nrf2 activity. Silence of Nrf2 using specific siRNA diminished the inhibitory effect of paeonol on NF-kappa B p65 activation and downstream expression, suggesting that Nrf2 was essential for protective effect of paeonol. These results showed that paeonol protected against periodontitisaggravated osteoclastogenesis and alveolar bone lesion via regulating Nrf2/NF-kappa B/NFATc1 signaling pathway.

AB Chronic hypobaric hypoxia induced muscle atrophy results in decreased physical performance at high altitude. Curcumin has been shown to have muscle sparing effects under cachectic conditions. However, the protective effects of curcumin under chronic hypobaric hypoxia have not been studied till now. Therefore, the present study aims at evaluating the effects of curcumin administration on muscle atrophy under chronic hypobaric hypoxia. Male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into four groups: Control (C)normoxia exposed, Control Treated (CT)-normoxia exposed and administered with curcumin at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight for 14 days, Hypoxia (H)-exposed to hypobaric hypoxia for 14 days and Hypoxia Treated (HT)-exposed to hypobaric hypoxia and administered with curcumin for 14 days. Oxidative stress, muscle protein degradation, proteolytic pathways, myosin heavy chain (MHC), CPK activity and muscle histology were performed in gastrocnemius muscle samples of the exposed rats. In addition, fatigue time on treadmill running was also evaluated to observe the effects of curcumin administration on physical performance of the rats. As previously shown, hypobaric hypoxia increased muscle protein degradation via upregulated calpain and ubiquitin-proteolytic pathways. An enhanced oxidative stress has been linked to upregulation of these pathways under hypoxic conditions. Curcumin administration resulted in reduced oxidative stress as well as reduced activity of the proteolytic pathways in HT group as compared to H group thereby resulting in reduced muscle protein degradation under hypobaric hypoxia. Histology of rat muscle revealed an increased number of muscle fibres in HT as compared to H group. Thus, increased number of muscle fibres and decreased muscle proteolysis following curcumin administration, lead to enhanced muscle mass under hypobaric hypoxia resulting in improved physical performance of the rats.

AB The five-year survival rate of esophageal cancer patients is less than 20%. This may be due to increased resistance (acquired or intrinsic) of tumor cells to chemo/radiotherapies, often caused by aberrant cell cycle, deregulated apoptosis, increases in growth factor signaling pathways, and/or changes in the proteome network. In addition, deregulation in non-coding RNA-mediated signaling pathways may contribute to resistance to therapies. At the molecular level, these resistance factors have now been linked to various microRNA (miRNAs), which have recently been shown to control cell development, differentiation and neoplasia. The increased stability and dysregulated expression of miRNAs have been associated with increased resistance to various therapies in several cancers, including esophageal cancer. Therefore, miRNAs represent the next generation of molecules with tremendous potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. However, detailed studies on miRNA-based therapeutic interventions are still in their infancy. Hence, in this review, we have summarized the current status of microRNAs in dictating the resistance/sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In addition, we have discussed various strategies to increase radiosensitivity, including targeted therapy, and the use of miRNAs as radiosensitive/radioresistance biomarkers for esophageal cancer in the clinical setting.

AB Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) of the brain and it is well known that the pathogenesis of PD is related to a number of risk factors including oxidative stress. Antioxidant 1 (ATOX1) protein plays a crucial role in various diseases as an antioxidant and chaperone. In this study, we determined whether Tat-ATOX1 could protect against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP thorn)-induced SH-SY5Y cell death and in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced animal model of PD. In the MPP thorn exposed SH-SY5Y cells, Tat-ATOX1 markedly inhibited cell death and toxicities. In addition, Tat-ATOX1 markedly suppressed the activation of Akt and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) as well as cleavage of caspase-3 and Bax expression levels. In a MPTP-induced animal model, Tat-ATOX1 transduced into brain and protected dopaminergic neuronal cell loss. Taken together, Tat-ATOX1 inhibits dopaminergic neuronal death through the suppression of MAPKs and apoptotic signal pathways. Thus, TatATOX1 represents a potential therapeutic protein drug candidate for PD. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM). All rights reserved.

   RESOLUTION
AB Ribosomes consist of many small proteins and few large RNA molecules. Both components are necessary for ribosome functioning during translation. According to widely accepted view, bacterial ribosomes contain always the same complement of ribosomal proteins. Comparative bacterial genomics data indicates that several ribosomal proteins are encoded by multiple paralogous genes suggesting structural heterogeneity of ribosomes. In E. coli, two r-proteins bL31 and bL36 are encoded by two genes: rpmE and ykgM encode bL31 protein paralogs bL31A and bL31B, and rpmJ and ykgO encode bL36 protein paralogs bL36A and bL36B respectively. We have found several similarities and differences between ribosomes of exponential and stationary growth phases by using quantitative mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography. First, composition of ribosome associating proteins changes profoundly as cells transition from exponential to stationary growth phase. Ribosomal core proteins bL31A and bL36A are replaced by bL31B and bL36B, respectively. Second, our X-ray structure of the 70S ribosome demonstrates that bL31B and bL36B proteins have similar ribosome binding sites to their A counterparts. Third, ribosome subpopulations containing A or B paralogs existed simultaneously demonstrating that E. coli ribosomes are heterogeneous with respect to their paralogous ribosomal protein composition that changes via protein exchange.

AB Several genes of IFN-mediated pathways in vertebrates, among them the genes that participate in the 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L pathway, have been identified in C. gigas. In the present study, we identified genes, which encode proteins having 2',5'-oligoadenylate degrading activity in C. gigas. These proteins belong to the 2H phosphoesterase superfamily and have sequence similarity to the mammalian A kinase anchoring protein 7 (AKAP7) central domain, which is responsible for the 2',5'phosphodiesterase (2',5'-PDE) activity. Comparison of the genomic structures of C. gigas proteins with that of AKAP7 suggests that these enzymes originate from a direct common ancestor. However, the identified nucleases are not typical 2',5'-PDEs. The found enzymes catalyse the degradation of 2',5'-linked oligoadenylates in a metal-ion-independent way, yielding products with 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and 5'-OH termini similarly to the 3'-5' bond cleavage in RNA, catalyzed by metal-independent ribonucleases. 3',5'-linked oligoadenylates are not substrates for them. The preferred substrates for the C. gigas enzymes are 5'-triphosphorylated 2',5'-oligoadenylates, whose major cleavage reaction results in the removal of the 5'-triphosphorylated 2',3'-cyclic phosphate derivative, leaving behind the respective unphosphorylated 2',5'-oligoadenylate. Such a cleavage reaction results in the direct inactivation of the biologically active 2-5A molecule. The 2',5'-ribonucleases (2',5'-RNases) from C. gigas could be members of the ancient group of ribonucleases, specific to 2'-5'phosphodiester bond, together with the enzyme that was characterized previously from the marine sponge Tethya aurantium. The novel 2',5'-RNases may play a role in the control of cellular 2-5A levels, thereby limiting damage to host cells after viral infection. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Human plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is an endogenous bioscavenger that hydrolyzes numerous medicamentous and poisonous esters and scavenges potent organophosphorus nerve agents. BChE is thus a marker for the diagnosis of OP poisoning. It is also considered a therapeutic target against Alzheimer's disease. Although the X-ray structure of a partially deglycosylated monomer of human BChE was solved 15 years ago, all attempts to determine the 3D structure of the natural full-length glycosylated tetrameric human BChE have been unsuccessful so far.
   Here, a combination of three complementary structural methodsdsingle-particle cryo-electron microscopy, molecular dynamics and small-angle X-ray scatteringdwere implemented to elucidate the overall structural and spatial organization of the natural tetrameric human plasma BChE. A 7.6 A cryoEM map clearly shows the major features of the enzyme: a dimer of dimers with a nonplanar monomer arrangement, in which the interconnecting super helix complex PRAD-(WAT) 4-peptide C-terminal tail is located in the center of the tetramer, nearly perpendicular to its plane, and is plunged deep between the four subunits. Molecular dynamics simulations allowed optimization of the geometry of the molecule and reconstruction of the structural features invisible in the cryoEM density, i.e., glycan chains and glycan interdimer contact areas, as well as intermonomer disulfide bridges at the C-terminal tail. Finally, SAXS data were used to confirm the consistency of the obtained model with the experimental data. The tetramer organization of BChE is unique in that the four subunits are joined at their C-termini through noncovalent contacts with a short polyproline-rich peptide. This tetramer structure could serve as a model for the design of highly stable glycosylated tetramers. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Actinoporins constitute a unique class of pore-forming toxins found in sea anemones that being secreted as soluble monomers are able to bind and permeabilize membranes leading to cell death. The interest in these proteins has risen due to their high cytotoxicity that can be properly used to design immunotoxins against tumor cells and antigen-releasing systems to cell cytosol. In this work we describe a novel actinoporin produced by Anthopleura nigrescens, an anemone found in the Central American Pacific Ocean. Here we report the amino acid sequence of an actinoporin as deduced from cDNA obtained from total body RNA. The synthetic DNA sequence encoding for one cytolysin variant was expressed in BL21 Star (DE3) Escherichia coli and the protein purified by chromatography on CM Sephadex C-25 with more than 97% homogeneity as verified by MS-MS and HPLC analyses. This actinoporin comprises 179 amino acid residues, consistent with its observed isotope-averaged molecular mass of 19 661 Da. The toxin lacks Cys and readily permeabilizes erythrocytes, as well as L1210 cells. CD spectroscopy revealed that its secondary structure is dominated by beta structure (58.5%) with 5.5% of alpha-helix, and 35% of random structure. Moreover, binding experiments to lipidic monolayers and to liposomes, as well as permeabilization studies in vesicles, revealed that the affinity of this toxin for sphingomyelin-containing membranes is quite similar to sticholysin II (StII). Comparison by spectroscopic techniques and modeling the three-dimensional structure of nigrelysin (Ng) showed a high homology with all but several differences were also detectable. Taken together, these results reinforce the notion that Ng is a novel member of the actinoporin pore-forming toxin (PFT) family with a HA as high as that of StII, the most potent actinoporin so far described, but with peculiar structural characteristics contributing to expand the understanding of the structure-function relationship in this protein family.

AB Oncologic diseases do not behave as isolated entities. Instead, they are based on complex systemic networks involving cell-cell communication between cancerous and healthy cells of the host, which may either facilitate or prevent cancer progression. In addition to cell-cell contacts, cells communicate through secreted factors in a process modulated by ligand concentration, receptor availability and synergy amongst several signaling circuits. Of these secreted factors, exosomes, 30-150 nm membrane vesicles of endocytic origin released by virtually all cells, have emerged as important cell-cell communication players both in physiological and pathological scenarios by being carriers of all the main biomolecules, including lipids, proteins, DNAs, messenger RNAs and microRNA, and performing intercellular transfer of components, locally and systemically. By acting both in tumor and non-tumor cells, such as fibroblasts, leukocytes, endothelial and progenitor cells, tumor-and non-tumor cells-derived exosomes can modulate tumor growth and invasion, tumor-associated angiogenesis, tissue inflammation and the immune system. In this Review, we summarize the main findings of the literature on the roles of exosomes in mediating interactions between tumor and tumor-associated cells. We also discuss how the molecular composition analysis of circulating exosomes in clinical settings has emerged as an attractive non-invasive source of liquid biopsies for early diagnosis, prognosis and follow-up of patients with oncologic diseases.

AB Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive primary tumour within the brain as well as the most common and lethal cerebral cancer, mainly because of treatment failure. Indeed, tumour recurrence is inevitable and fatal in a short period of time. Glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) are thought to participate in tumour initiation, expansion, resistance to treatments, including to the alkylating chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide, and relapse. Here, we assessed whether extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by GSCs could disseminate factors involved in resistance mechanisms. We first characterized EVs either circulating in peripheral blood from newly diagnosed patients or released by patient-derived temozolomide-resistant GSCs. We found that EVs from both sources were mainly composed of particles homogeneous in size (50-100 nm), while they were more abundant in liquid biopsies from GBM patients, as compared to healthy donors. Further, mass spectrometry analysis from GSC-derived EVs unveiled that particles from control and temozolomide-treated cells share core components of EVs, as well as ribosome- and proteasome-associated networks. More strikingly, temozolomide treatment led to the enrichment of EVs with cargoes dedicated to cell adhesion processes. Thus, while relatively inefficient in killing GSCs in vitro, temozolomide could instead increase the release of pro-tumoral information.

AB Personalized and regenerative medicine is an emerging therapeutic strategy that is based on cell biology and biomedical engineering used to develop biological substitutes to maintain normal function or restore damaged tissues and organs.
   The secretory capacities of different cell types are now explored as such possible therapeutic regenerative agents in a variety of diseases. A secretome can comprise chemokines, cytokines, growth factors, but also extracellular matrix components, microvesicles and exosomes as well as genetic material and may differ depending on the tissue and the stimulus applied to the cell. With regard to clinical applications, the secretome of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) is currently the most widely explored. However, other cell types such as pericytes may have similar properties as MSC and the potential therapeutic possibilities of these cells are only just beginning to emerge. In this review, we will summarize the currently available data describing the secretome of pericytes and its potential implications for tissue regeneration, whereby we especially focus on brain pericytes as potential new target cell for neuroregeneration and brain repair.

AB The multifactorial complexity of spinal cord injuries includes the formation of a glial scar, of which chondroitin sulphated proteoglycans (CSPG) are an integral component. Previous studies have shown CSPG to have inhibitory effects on endothelial and neuronal cell growth, highlighting the difficulty of spinal cord regeneration. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) are widely used as a cell therapy, and there is mounting evidence for their angiogenic and neurotrophic paracrine properties. However, in vivo studies have observed poor engraftment and survival of MSC when injected into SCI. Currently, it is not known whether increasing CSPG concentrations seen after SCI may affect MSC; therefore we have investigated the effects of CSPG exposure to MSC in vitro. CSPG-mediated inhibition of MSC adhesion was observed when MSC were cultured on substrates of increasing CSPG concentration, however MSC viability was not affected even up to five days of culture. Culture conditioned medium harvested from these cultures (primed MSC CM) was used as both culture substrata and soluble medium for EA.hy926 endothelial cells and SH-SY5Y neuronal cells. MSC CM was angiogenic, promoting endothelial cell adhesion, proliferation and tubule formation. However, exposing MSC to CSPG reduced the effects of CSPG-primed MSC CM on endothelial cell adhesion and proliferation, but did not reduce MSC-induced endothelial tubule formation. Primed MSC CM also promoted neuronal cell adhesion, which was reduced following exposure to CSPG. There were no marked differences in neurite outgrowth in MSC CM from CSPG primed MSC cultures versus control conditions, although non-primed MSC CM from the same donors was found to significantly enhance neurite outgrowth. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that MSC are resilient to CSPG exposure, but that there is a marked effect of CSPG on their paracrine regenerative activity. The findings increase our understanding of how the wound microenvironment after SCI can mitigate the beneficial effects of MSC transplantation.

AB The identification of circulating biomarkers capable of being used as routine for diagnosis, prognosis, risk stratification and therapeutic monitoring is still the major aim at clinical proteomics. However, the direct search in blood samples or other clinical relevant biofluids is frequently associated with technical limitations that make the biomarker discovery process extremely difficult when using these types of samples. In this sense, the use of different approaches, such as the analysis of cells' secretomes, can be an important and promising complementary method for the identification and pre-selection of potential circulating biomarkers.
   Therefore, the present review is focused on published works exclusively devoted to the use of cells' secretomes for the identification of new circulating biomarkers. Considering these publications, the translational workflow used to identify potential protein circulating biomarkers from untargeted cells' secretome screenings is presented and discussed in this review. This translational workflow follows a 3-phase pipeline (discovery, verification and validation phase) similar to the "triangular strategy" already applied in biomarker discovery using blood or other clinical samples.

AB Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a severe blistering disease resulting from a lack of type VII collagen production. Recent clinical trials have shown efficacy of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in the treatment of epidermolysis bullosa, including improved basement membrane restructuring and cutaneous wound healing. The mechanism as to how type VII collagen is transferred from donor stem cell to recipient RDEB cells has not been defined. Here, we submit the model that BM-MSC-derived extracellular vesicles serve at least two roles: 1) to help transport type VII collagen within the extracellular space; and 2) to feed RDEB fibroblasts with messenger RNA that codes for type VII collagen, resulting in COL7A1 translation and synthesis of type VII collagen alpha chain proteins by RDEB fibroblasts. Utilizing a chemoselective ligation detection method, we found RDEB cells that were treated simultaneously with BM-MSC EVs and an L-methionine analog, L-homopropargylglycine (HPG), synthesized collagen VII alpha chain protein that contained the alkyne group of HPG to react (i.e. undergo the Click-iT (R) reaction) with azide-modified Alexa 594, suggesting de novo synthesis of type VII collagen by RDEB fibroblasts. Thus, our results support a model in which BM-MSC EVs help increase type VII collagen levels available to recipient cells by 1) donating BM-MSC type VII collagen protein and 2) inducing RDEB fibroblasts to make their own type VII collagen protein. These findings allow us to hypothesize that the secretome of BM-MSCs could have therapeutic value in the treatment of RDEB-related skin disorders.

AB In recent years, we have witnessed a significant increase in the amount of studies using Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) for cancer therapy, mostly as vectors for drug or gene delivery strategies. This is because of their intrinsic capacity of homing into tumor niches. However, the interactions between MSCs themselves and tumor cells is not fully understood, with contradictory results frequently being observed regarding their effects on cancer cell invasion and proliferation. This poses an important question of safety in respect to the application of these cells. The source of the MSC population used, as well as the type of cancer cells under study might strongly influence this interaction. Moreover, differences in isolation protocols, culture media compositions, time of culture and conditioned media collection, or even timing and mode of MSCs administration to in vivo models of cancer may also affect the interaction MSC-tumor cells. In this review, we drive our focus into malignant brain tumors, particularly gliomas, one of the deadliest forms of cancer. Moreover, we look with some detail into different studies using MSCs as a treatment for brain tumors and compare them, highlighting the main deviations and similarities among them.

AB Exosome-mediated intercellular communication has been increasingly recognized as having a broad impact on Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Still, limited information exists regarding their "modus operandi", as it critically depends on exosomal cargo, environmental context and target cells. Therefore, a more thorough understanding of the role of exosomes from different cell types as mediators of neuroinflammation in AD context is a decisive step to open avenues for innovative and efficient therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that SH-SY5Y cells transfected with the Swedish mutant of APP(695) (SHSwe) remarkably express increased inflammatory markers, combined with higher APP and A beta(1-40) production, when compared to naive SH-SY5Y (SH) cells. Although exerting an early clearance effect on extracellular APP and A beta accumulation when in co-culture with SHSwe cells, human CHME3 microglia gradually lose such property, and express both pro-inflammatory (iNOS, IL-1 beta, THF-alpha, MHC class II, IL-6) and proresolving genes (IL-10 and Arginase 1), while also evidence increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity. Interestingly, upregulation of inflammatory-associated miRNA (miR)-155, miR-146a and miR-124 by SHSwe secretome shows to be time-dependent and to inversely correlate with their respective targets (SOCS-1, IRAK1 and C/EBP-alpha). We report that microglia also internalize exosomes released from SHSwe cells, which are enriched in miR-155, miR-146a, miR-124, miR-21 and miR-125b and recapitulate the cells of origin. Furthermore, we show that SHSwe-derived exosomes are capable of inducing acute and delayed microglial upregulation of THF-alpha, HMGB1 and S100B pro-inflammatory markers, from which only S100B is found on their derived exosomes. Most importantly, our data reveal that miR-21 is a consistent biomarker that is found not only in SHSwe cells and in their released exosomes, but also in the recipient CHME3 microglia and derived exosomes. This work contributes to the increased understanding of neuron-microglia communication and exosome-mediated neuroinflammation in AD, while highlights miR-21 as a promising biomarker/target for therapeutic intervention.

AB Cell transplantation using Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) secretome have recently been presented as a possible free-based therapy for CNS related disorders. MSC secretome is rich in several bio-factors that act synergically towards the repair of damaged tissues, thus making it an ideal candidate for regenerative applications. Great effort is currently being made to map the molecules that compose the MSC secretome. Previous proteomic characterization of the secretome (in the form of conditioned media - CM) of MSCs derived from adipose tissue (ASC), bone-marrow (BMSC) and umbilical cord (HUCPVC) was performed by our group, where proteins relevant for neuroprotection, neurogenic, neurodifferentiation, axon guidance and growth functions were identified. Moreover, we have found significant differences among the expression of several molecules, which may indicate that their therapeutic outcome might be distinct. Having this in mind, in the present study, the neuroregulatory potential of ASC, BMSC and HUCPVC CM in promoting neurodifferentiation and axonal outgrowth was tested in vitro, using human telencephalon neuroprogenitor cells and dorsal root ganglion explants, respectively. The CM from the three MSC populations induced neuronal differentiation from human neural progenitor cells, as well as neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglion explants. Moreover, all the MSC populations promoted the same extent of neurodifferentiation, while ASC CM demonstrated higher potential in promoting axonal growth. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The secretome produced by cells within the bone marrow is significant to homeostasis. The bone marrow, a well-studied organ, has multiple niches with distinct roles for supporting stem cell functions. Thus, an understanding of mediators involved in the regulation of stem cells could serve as a model for clinical problems and solutions such as tissue repair and regeneration. The exosome secretome of bone marrow stem cells is a developing area of research with respect to the regenerative potential by bone marrow cell, particularly the mesenchymal stem cells. The bone marrow niche regulates endogenous processes such as hematopoiesis but could also support the survival of tumors such as facilitating the cancer stem cells to exist in dormancy for decades. The bone marrow-derived secretome will be critical to future development of therapeutic strategies for oncologic diseases, in addition to regenerative medicine. This article discusses the importance for parallel studies to determine how the same secretome may compromise safety during the use of stem cells in regenerative medicine.

AB Secreted trophic factors are key to maintain the structural and functional integrity of the retina, as they regulate cellular pathways responsible for survival, function, and response to injury. Nevertheless, these same factors can also be involved in retinal pathologies, as a consequence of the impairment of the secretory function of cells. The cells considered as major contributors to the retinal secretome are the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and Muller cells. Their role in the pathophysiology of the most common neovascular pathologies in the retina - Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), and Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) - is highlighted in this short review, together with current trophic factor-based therapies, which are mainly focused on controlling inflammation, cell survival, and angiogenesis.

AB Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are progenitor cells identified in many adult tissues, in particular in bone marrow or adipose tissue and, in placental tissues. MSCs exert pleiotropic functions that render them attractive for many clinical applications, both in degenerative and inflammatory diseases. Their main mode of action is through the secretion of trophic factors that can be released in the extracellular milieu or packaged within extracellular vesicles. These factors can be proteins, lipids, mRNAs or miRNAs that possess diverse effects, notably pro-angiogenic, anti-fibrotic, anti-apoptotic or anti-inflammatory. The anti-inflammatory role of a number of miRNAs has been demonstrated with different types of immune cells but few have been associated with the immunomodulatory function of MSCs. In this review, we summarize the data on the miRNAs that have been validated as participating to the anti-inflammatory role of MSCs.

AB Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and within them adipose tissue derived stem cells (ASCs), have been shown to have therapeutic effects on central nervous system (CNS) cell populations. Such effects have been mostly attributed to soluble factors, as well as vesicles, present in their secretome. Yet, little is known about the impact that MSC passaging might have in the secretion therapeutic profile. Our aim was to show how human ASCs (hASCs) passage number influences the effect of their secretome in neuronal survival, differentiation and axonal growth. For this purpose, post-natal rat hippocampal primary cultures, human neural progenitor cell (hNPCs) cultures and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) explants were incubated with secretome, collected as conditioned media (CM), obtained from hASCs in P3, P6, P9 and P12. Results showed no differences when comparing percentages of MAP-2 positive cells (a mature neuronal marker) in neuronal cultures or hNPCs, after incubation with hASCs secretome from different passages. The same was observed regarding DRG neurite outgrowth. In order to characterize the secretomes obtained from different passages, a proteomic analysis was performed, revealing that its composition did not vary significantly with passage number P3 to P12. Results allowed us to identify several key proteins, such as pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF), DJ-1, interleucin-6 (IL-6) and galectin, all of which have already proven to play neuroprotective and neurodifferentiating roles. Proteins that promote neurite outgrowth were also found present, such as semaphorin 7A and glypican-1. We conclude that cellular passaging does not influence significantly hASCs's secretome properties especially their ability to support post-natal neuronal survival, induce neurodifferentiation and promote axonal growth.

AB Introduction: Dental stem cells (DMSC) have been studied extensively since their early discovery. However, the data regarding osteogenic potential of DMSC with other cell types is sparse and the secretome proteins underlying these differences have not been explored. In this study, we have compared the osteogenic and adipogenic potential of DMSC with Bone Marrow Stem cells (BMSC) and reported the contribution of secretome proteins in controlling their differentiation.
   Methods: Osteogenic potential of these stem cells was compared by mineralization assay, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay, immunofluorescence of dentine sialo phosphoprotein (DSPP) & qPCR for osteogenic genes. Adipogenic potential was compared by Oil Red O staining and qPCR for PPAR-gamma, leptin & adipsin. Proteomic analysis of secretome was performed by employing WATERS nano Lc-MS/MS system.
   Results: We observed a higher osteogenic potential in DMSC, especially dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) as compared to BMSC population but adipogenic potential was found to be better in BMSC as compared to DMSC. Deeper investigations into secretome of these cells by Lc-MS/MS revealed the presence of proteins pertaining to osteogenic and adipogenic lineage. Presence of some important proteins regulating osteogenic (DSPP, BMP7, DDR2, USP9X) and adipogenic differentiation (NCOA2, PEG10, LPA) in secretome of BMSC and DMSC reflected the role of paracrine factors during differentiation.
   Conclusion: Our study provides first evidence regarding regulation of osteogenic/adipogenic potential by secretome proteins in DMSC and BMSC. DMSC especially DPSC and its secretome show an inherent tendency for higher osteogenic differentiation and lower adipogenic differentiation, these may be potential candidates for effective future therapy in osteoporosis where disturbance of osteocyte/adipocyte homeostasis is reported.

AB We previously reported that ATF3 and Runx2 are involved in breast cancer progression and bone metastasis. The expression of these genes can be controlled by post-transcriptional regulators such as microRNAs (miRNAs). In this study, we identified and validated the functional role of miR-590-3p in human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231). There was an inverse correlation between the expression of miR-590-3p and its putative target genes, ATF3 and Runx2 in these cells. Overexpression of miR-590-3p decreased the expression of ATF3 and Runx2 at the mRNA and protein levels in MDA-MB231 cells. Luciferase reporter assay identified a direct interaction of 3' UTRs of ATF3 and Runx2 with miR-590-3p in these cells. Overexpression of miR-590-3p also decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Based on our results, we suggest that miR-590-3p might have potential clinical applications towards controlling breast cancer progression and bone metastasis.

AB Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are UVR-absorbing metabolites typically produced by cyanobacteria and marine algae, but their properties are not limited to direct sun screening protection. Herein, we examine the antioxidant activities of porphyra-334 and shinorine and demonstrate that these MAAs are prospective activators of the cytoprotective Keap1 -Nrf2 pathway. The ability of porphyra-334 and shinorine to bind with Keap1 was determined using fluorescence polarization (FP) and thermal shift assays to detect Keap1 receptor antagonism. Concomitantly, the ability of porphyra-334 and shinorine to dissociate Nrf2 from Keap1 was confirmed also by measurement of increased mRNA expression of Nrf2 targeted genes encoding oxidative stress defense proteins in primary skin fibroblasts prior and post UVR exposure. Surprisingly, enhanced transcriptional regulation was only promoted by MAAs in cells after exposure to UVR-induced oxidative stress. Furthermore, the in-vitro antioxidant activities of porphyra-334 and shinorine determined by the DPPH free-radical quenching assay were low in comparison to ascorbic acid. However, their antioxidant capacity determined by the ORAC assay to quench free radicals via hydrogen atom transfer is substantial. Hence, the dual nature of MAAs to provide antioxidant protection may offer a prospective chemotherapeutic strategy to prevent or retard the progression of multiple degenerative disorders of ageing.

AB Metformin is used to reduce hyperglycemia that induces energetic stress and leads to reduction in gluconeogenesis. Also, metformin inhibits complex I in oxidative phosphorylation, thereby decreasing cellular ATP levels. Activation of AMPK by the reduced ATP levels can induce inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and activate p53-mediated DNA repair.
   DNA polymerase-beta and XRCC1 function to repair DNA damages in the BER (base excision repair) system. In type 2 diabetes patients, metformin can enhance AMPK activation therefore suppress oxidative stress. The changes on oxidative stress may alter p53's function and effect many cellular pathways such as; DNA repair. In our project we aim to understand the effects of metformin on p53 and DNA-BER system based on the oxidative status in type 2 diabetes patients.
   Oxidative and antioxidative capacity, catalase, SOD, GPx activities and, DNA pol beta, XRCC1 and p53 levels were measured in metformin using or non-using type 2 diabetes patients and controls.
   Metformin enhanced SOD and GPx activities in type 2 diabetes patients but the reflection of this increase to the total antioxidant capacity was not significant. Although the increase in DNA pol beta was not significant, XRCC1 and p53 levels were significantly upregulated with metformin treatment in type 2 diabetes patients. Our study reinforces the potential benefit of metformin in antioxidative capacity to protect cells from diabetic oxidative stress and in regulation of DNA BER system.

AB The mitochondrial phosphate-activated glutaminase C (GAC) is produced by the alternative splicing of the GLS gene. Compared to the other GLS isoform, the kidney-type glutaminase (KGA), GAC is more enzymatically efficient and of particular importance for cancer cell growth. Although its catalytic mechanism is well understood, little is known about how post-translational modifications can impact GAC function. Here, we identified by mass spectrometry a phosphorylated serine at the GLS N-terminal domain (at position 95) and investigated its role on regulating GAC activity. The ectopic expression of the phosphomimetic mutant (GAC.S95D) in breast cancer cells, compared to wild-type GAC (GAC.WT), led to decreased glutaminase activity, glutamine uptake, glutamate release and intracellular glutamate levels, without changing GAC sub-cellular localization. Interestingly, cells expressing the GAC.S95D mutant, compared to GAC.WT, presented decreased migration and vimentin level, an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition marker. These results reveal that GAC is post-translationally regulated by phosphorylation, which affects cellular glutamine metabolism and glutaminase-related cell phenotype.

AB Histone posttranslational modifications regulate diverse nuclear functions, including DNA repair. Here, we use mass spectrometry, western blotting, immunohistochemistry and advanced confocal microscopy in order to show radiation-specific changes in the histone signature. We studied wild-type mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and mESCs with a depletion of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), which plays a role in DNA repair. Irradiation by gamma-rays increased the S139 phosphorylation of histone H2AX but reduced the level of the H3K9-R17 peptide, which contains S10 phosphorylation (H3S10ph). On an individual cellular level, H3S10ph was low in highly gamma H2AX-positive UV laser-induced DNA lesions, and this nuclear distribution pattern was not changed by HDAC1 depletion. Despite this fact, spontaneous gamma H2AX-positive DNA lesions colocalized with large H3S10ph-positive nuclear bodies that appear in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Similarly, by FLIM-FRET analysis, we observed an interaction between H3S10ph and gamma H2AX in the G2 phase. However, this interaction was reduced when cells were exposed to gamma-rays. A mutual link between H3S10ph and gamma H2AX was not observed in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Together, our data show that despite the fact that H3S10ph is not directly involved in DNA repair, a decrease in H3S10 phosphorylation and weakened interaction between H3S10ph and gamma H2AX is a result of radiation-induced damage of the genome. In this case, gamma-irradiation also decreased the number of cells in the G1 phase, characterized by no interaction between H3S10ph and gamma H2AX.

AB Systematic evolution of ligand by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is an efficient method used to isolate high-affinity single stranded oligonucleotides from a large random sequence pool. These SELEX-derived oligonucleotides named aptamer, can be selected against a broad spectrum of target molecules including proteins, cells, microorganisms and chemical compounds. Like antibodies, aptamers have a great potential in interacting with and binding to their targets through structural recognition and are therefore called "chemical antibodies". However, aptamers offer advantages over antibodies including smaller size, better tissue penetration, higher thermal stability, lower immunogenicity, easier production, lower cost of synthesis and facilitated conjugation or modification with different functional moieties. Thus, aptamers represent an attractive substitution for protein antibodies in the fields of biomarker discovery, diagnosis, imaging and targeted therapy. Enormous interest in aptamer technology triggered the development of SELEX that has underwent numerous modifications since its introduction in 1990. This review will discuss the recent advances in SELEX methods and their advantages and limitations. Aptamer applications are also briefly outlined in this review.

AB Photoaffinity labeling (PAL) in combination with recent developments in mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for studying nucleic acid-protein interactions, enabling crosslinking of both partners through covalent bond formation. Such a strategy requires a preliminary study of the most judicious photoreactive group to crosslink efficiently with the target protein. In this study, we report a survey of three different photoreactive nucleobases (including a guanine functionalized with a benzophenone or a diazirine and the zero-length agent 4-thiothymine) incorporated in 30-mer oligonucleotides (ODN) containing a biotin moiety for selective trapping and enrichment of single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSB). First, the conditions and efficiency of the photochemical reaction with a purified protein using human replication protein A as the relevant model was studied. Secondly, the ability of the probe as bait to photocrosslink and enrich SSB in cell lysate was addressed. Among the different ODN probes studied, we showed that 4-thiothymine was the most relevant: i) it allows efficient and specific trapping of SSB in whole cell extracts in a similar extent as the widely used diazirine, it features the advantages of a zero-length agent thus retaining the physicochemical properties of the ODN bait; iii) ODN including this photochemical agent are easily accessible. In combination with mass spectrometry, the probes incorporating this nucleobase are powerful tools for PAL strategies and can be added in the toolbox of the traditional photocrosslinkers for studying DNA-protein interactions.

The present study aims to describe the two roles of SAC: (1) inhibitory effect against xanthine oxidase (XO) enzyme activity; and (2) anti-inflammatory property against MSU crystal-induced gouty inflammation in rat. The inhibitory effect of SAC against bovine XO enzyme activity was determined in vitro. In silico analysis was carried out to determine the intermolecular interaction between SAC and bovine XO. MSU crystal was injected in the right paw of the rat to induce gouty inflammation. SAC (40 mg/kg body weight) and colchicine (positive control; 1 mg/kg body weight) was given for 3 days. At the end of the treatment, the oxidative stress, antioxidant parameters and mitochondrial function were determined in the ankle joint tissue. The concentration of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta was measured in the serum using ELISA. SAC inhibited (IC50 value, 33 mu g/ml) XO enzyme activity in a competitive mode with corresponding Ki value of 4 mu g/ml. In silico analysis predicted the interaction of SAC with the amino acids such as Arg880, Phe798, Phe914 and Phe1009 of XO enzyme. The root mean square deviation, root mean square fluctuation and free energy calculation values confirmed the stable SAC-XO interaction. The inhibition of SAC on XO enzyme activity in in vivo was further confirmed by silkworm model. SAC through reducing oxidative stress, enhancing antioxidants, protecting mitochondrial function has shown anti-inflammatory effect against MSU crystal-induced gout which was observed as reduced level of inflammatory markers in the serum. The medicinal potential of SAC as a preventive agent through its XO inhibitory property as well as curative agent through its anti-inflammatory property against gout has been understood from the present study.

AB Multiple laboratory evidences indicate that distinct variants of ALK translocations differ in their biochemical properties and responsiveness to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). These data are supported by some clinical studies, which showed improved responses to crizotinib in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients carrying particular variants of ALK translocation. We retrospectively considered 64 Russian patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC, who were treated by crizotinib (n = 23), ceritinib (n = 39) or alectinib (n = 2). ALK fusion variants were genotyped by PCR. Median progression-free survival (PFS) approached to 18 and 21 months in subjects with "short" (v.3a/b, v.5a/b) vs. "long" (TAPE-domain containing) fusion variants (p = 0.783), respectively; similar data were obtained while comparing EML4/ALK variant 1 vs. other ALK translocations (19 and 21 months, respectively; p = 0.604). Objective response rates were also strikingly similar in the above groups ("short": 88%, "long": 77%, p = 0.479; variant 1: 76%, other translocations: 81%, p = 0.753). Furthermore, ALK variants did not influence the disease outcomes when patients treated by crizotinib and ceritinib were analyzed separately. Overall, PFS on ALK TKI did not depend on whether the drug was administered upfront or after chemotherapy. Ceritinib produced significantly longer PFS than crizotinib (p = 0.022). In conclusion, this study revealed that distinct ALK translocation variants render similar clinical responsiveness to ALK inhibitors.

AB The mitochondrial S-adenosylmethionine carrier (SAMC), encoded by the SLC25A26 gene, catalyzes the uptake of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) from the cytosol into mitochondria in exchange for S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), produced inside the mitochondria. In the last years we have been functionally characterizing the promoter of SLC25A26 gene. In this study we show that a silencer activity is present in the region from -756 bp to -504 bp, which specifically binds a protein present in Caski cells nuclear extracts. By in silico analysis, EMSA, ChIP, overexpressing and silencing experiments this protein was identified as FOXD3 which acts as a repressor of SLC25A26 expression. Interestingly, the repressor activity of FOXD3 is completely abolished by treating Caski cells with folate via a mechanism that involves methylation of FOXD3 gene promoter. This finding could have important impact in cancer cells where SLC25A26 is downregulated. Finally, the DPE and INR putative sites were also identified. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The x-ray structure of the monotopic membrane protein (S)-mandelate dehydrogenase (MDH) from Pseudomonas putida reveals an inherent flexibility of its membrane binding segment that might be important for its biological activity. The surface of MDH exhibits a concentration of the positive charges on one side and the negative charges on the other side. The putative membrane binding surface of MDH has a concentric circular ridge, formed by positively charged residues, which projects away from the protein surface by similar to 4 angstrom; this is an unique structural feature and not observed in other monotopic membrane proteins to our knowledge. There are three alpha-helixes in the membrane binding region. Based on the structure of MDH, it is possible to propose that the interaction of MDH with the membrane is stabilized by coplanar electrostatic interactions, between the positively charged concentric circular ridge and the negatively charged head-groups of the phospholipid bilayer, along with three alpha-helixes that provide additional stability by inserting into the membrane. The structure reveals the possible orientation of these helixes along with possible roles for the individual residues which form those helixes. These alpha-helixes may play a role in the enzyme's mobility. A detergent molecule, N-Dodecyl-beta-maltoside, is inserted between the membrane binding region and rest of the molecule and may provide structural stability to intra-protein regions by forming hydrogen bonds and close contacts. From the average Bfactor of the MDH structure, it is likely that MDH is highly mobile, which might be essential for its interaction in membrane and non-membrane environments, as its substrate (S)-mandelate, is from the cytoplasm, while its electron acceptor is a component of the membrane electron transport chain.

AB Receptor for Advanced Glycation End product (RAGE) is a multiligand receptor implicated in diverse pathological conditions such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, cancer and neural diseases. Extracellular, RAGE consists of V, C1 and C2 domains. Here, we show RAGE exists as a monomer in equilibrium with a fraction of a covalently linked dimer of monomers via its V domain through cysteine. In order to understand the functional implication of this dimer, we examined the binding capacity and functional potential of RAGE dimer via advanced glycation end products (AGEs) which shows enhanced binding capacity towards V domain, ERK phosphorylation, cytokine release and actin polymerization ability of the dimeric form for AGEs compared with the reduced monomeric form. Our data, suggests that the dimeric state of RAGE controls its function and ligand mediated signaling which may play important role in RAGE mediated various diseases.

AB Relaxin family peptides perform a variety of biological functions by activating four G protein-coupled receptors, namely RXFP1-4. Our recent study demonstrated that selectivity of the chimeric relaxin family peptide R3/I5 towards the homologous RXFP3 and RXFP4 can be modulated by replacement of the highly conserved nonchiral B23Gly or B24Gly with some natural I.-amino acids. To investigate the mechanism of this modulating effect, in the present study we incorporated unnatural amino acids into the B23 or B24 position of a semi-synthetic R3/I5 that was prepared by a novel sortase-catalysed ligation approach using synthetic relaxin-3 B-chain and recombinant INSL5 A-chain. R3/I5 was a weak agonist for RXFP3 after B23Gly was replaced by D-Ala or D-Ser, but a strong antagonist for this receptor after B23Gly was replaced by corresponding I.-amino acids. However, these replacements always resulted in a weak agonist for RXFP4. Thus, configuration of the B23 residue of R3/I5 affected activation of RXFP3 but not RXFP4. For the B24 residue, both size and configuration affected receptor selectivity of R3/I5. L-amino acids with an appropriate size, such as L-Ser and L-Abu, had the greatest effect on increasing the selectivity of R3/I5 towards RXFP3 over the homologous RXFP4. Our present results provided new insights into receptor selectivity of R3/I5, and would facilitate design of novel agonists or antagonists for RXFP3 and RXFP4 in future studies.

AB Thymosin alpha 1 (T alpha 1), a hormone containing 28 amino acids, has been approved in several cancer therapies, but the lack of tumor-targeting hinders its full use in tumor treatment. We designed a new peptide by connecting T alpha 1 and RGDR, generating a product, T alpha 1-RGDR, where RGDR is located in the C-end with both tumor-homing and cell internalizing properties (C-end rule peptides, a consensus R/KXXR/K motif). This work aimed to study the antitumor and immunological activities of T alpha 1-RGDR, and its differences compared with the wild-type T alpha 1. The antitumor and immunological activities of T alpha 1-RGDR were measured using the 616F10 tumor and immunologic suppression models. T alpha 1-RGDR treatment led to significant inhibition of tumor growth at a dose at which T alpha 1 showed a slight effect in the 616F10 tumor growth model. In the immunologic suppression model, T alpha 1-RGDR shared almost equivalent immunomodulatory effect with T alpha 1. These results demonstrated the better therapeutic effects after treatment with T alpha 1-RGDR compared with T alpha 1. Moreover, both T alpha 1-RGDR and T alpha 1 shared a helical conformation in the presence of trifluoroethanol based on CD spectroscopy. Our dock information of T alpha 1-RGDR when combined with integrin alpha nu beta 3 or neuropilin-1 further confirmed previous experimental results. All these findings suggest that T alpha 1-RGDR might be a useful therapy for tumors by overcoming its wild type limitation of tumor homing.

AB This study was conducted to investigate the effects of DJ-1 deficiency on brown adipose tissue (BAT) function in mice. DJ-1 knockout (KO) mouse models and wild-type littermates placed on a normal diet or high-fat diet were utilized to demonstrate the direct consequences of DJ-1 deletion on BAT characteristics, thermogenic ability, lipid metabolism, and microenvironment regulation. Global DJ-1 KO mice had defective brown adipose tissue activity culminating in a profound whitening of BAT. Despite aberrations in inactive BAT associated with greater lipid accretion, decreased sympathetic activity, mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced vascularity, and autophagy activation, we found that the body weight and energy balance were unaffected in male mice depleted of DJ-1. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that male DJ-1 KO mice exhibit defects in BAT activity but do not gain more weight, revealing that BAT activity is not necessarily required for predisposing DJ-1 KO mice to obesity. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of DJ-1 in BAT could provide novel insights into the treatment of obesity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies as well as the third leading cause for cancer-related death. Molecular basis of GC are essential and critical for its therapeutic treatment, but still remain poorly understood. T-cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA1) extensively involves in cancer progression, whereas its role and regulation mechanism in GC have not been revealed. In the present study, we found that TIA-1 protein level was down-regulated in GC tissues and TIA1 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of GC cells. Then, we used bioinformatics to predict miR-487a as the upstream regulator of TIA1 and we also observed an inverse correlation between miR-487a level and TIA-1 protein level in GC tissues. Next, we demonstrated that miR-487a directly targeted TIA1 via binding to its 3'-untranslated region. Furthermore, we investigated the role of miR-487a-TIA1 pathway in the growth of GC cells both in vitro and in vivo. The repression of TIA-1 by miR-487a promoted cell proliferation and suppressed cell apoptosis in vitro, and the knockdown of miR-487a had the opposite effects. Finally, we demonstrated that miR-487a promoted the development of gastric tumor growth in xenograft mice by targeting TIA-1. These effects could be partially reversed by restoring the expression of TIA-1. Overall, our results reveal that TIA1 is a tumor suppressor gene and is directly regulated by miR-487a in GC, which may offer new therapeutic targets for GC treatment.

AB ZNF224 is a KRAB-zinc finger transcription factor that exerts a key tumor suppressive role in chronic myelogenous leukemia.
   In this study, we identify the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl as a novel target of ZNF224 transcriptional repression activity. Axl overexpression is found in many types of cancer and is frequently associated with drug resistance. Interestingly, we also found that sensitivity to imatinib can be partly restored in imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia cells by ZNF224 overexpression and the resulting suppression of Axl expression.
   These results, in accordance with our previous findings, support the role of ZNF224 in imatinib responsiveness and shed new insights into potential therapeutic use of ZNF224 in imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia.

AB The sweet protein monellin has an intensely sweet potency but limited stability. We have identified a double-sites mutant (E2N/E23A) of the single-chain monellin (MNEI) with both improved sweetness (about 3-fold) and thermostability (10 degrees C). However, the structural basis of its superior properties remains elusive until now. Herein we report its crystal structure at a resolution 1.90 A. Similar to the wild-type, E2N/E23A adopts a wedge-shaped structure consisting of a five-strand d-sheet partially "wrapped" around an alpha-helix. However, distinguishing parts were present in the loops region, including a remarkable conformation shift from beta-strand to loop around residue R39. Molecular docking revealed the persistence of conserved protein-receptor interface and formation of new intermolecular ionic bonds in the E2N/E23A-receptor complex involving the taste-active residue R39 of the sweet protein, which could account for its significant improvement of sweetness. On the other hand, a rearrangement of intramolecular interaction network including the C-H ... pi bond between A23 and F89 that led to enhanced hydrophobicity in the protein core, could be correlated with its improved thermostability. Furthermore, two new sweeter mutants of MNEI were created. These findings highlight the critical roles of key sweetness determinant residue R39 and hydrophobicity at the protein core for the sweetness and thermostability of the protein, respectively, which thus provide a deeper insight for understanding the structure-function relationship of the sweet protein as well as guidance for rational design of this unique biomacromolecule.

AB Many oligo and polysaccharides (including paramylon) are critical in the Euglena gracilis life-cycle and they are synthesized by glycosyl transferases using UDP-glucose as a substrate. Herein, we report the molecular cloning of a gene putatively coding for a UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (EgrUDP-GIcPPase) in E. gracilis. After heterologous expression of the gene in Escherichia coli, the recombinant enzyme was characterized structural and functionally. Highly purified EgrUDP-GIcPPase exhibited a monomeric structure, able to catalyze synthesis of UDP-glucose with a V-max of 3350 U.mg(-1). Glucose-1P and UTP were the preferred substrates, although the enzyme also used (with lower catalytic efficiency) TTP, galactose-1P and mannose-1P. Oxidation by hydrogen peroxide inactivated the enzyme, an effect reversed by reduction with dithiothreitol or thioredoxin. The redox process would involve sulfenic acid formation, since no pair of the 7 cysteine residues is close enough in the 3D structure of the protein to form a disulfide bridge. Electrophoresis studies suggest that, after oxidation, the enzyme arranges in many enzymatically inactive structural conformations; which were also detected in vivo. Finally, confocal fluorescence microscopy provided evidence for a cytosolic (mainly in the flagellum) localization of the enzyme.

AB ADP-ribosylation factor-like3 (ARL3) is a member of the ADP-ribosylation factor family of GTP-binding proteins that plays important role in regulating Ciliary trafficking. It ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues and tumor cell lines. However, the location and function of ARL3 in organelles are rarely known. In this study, we explored ARL3 subcellular localization in an all-round way in HEK293T, Neuro-2A and U251 cells by density gradient centrifugation and immunofluorescence. The results showed that ARL3 is expressed in most of organelles, and an iodixonal step gradient was further confirmed that ARL3 is mainly localized to the mitochondria, endosomes, lysosomes, and proteasome. By molecular functional analysis, we observed that ARL3 promotes the aggregation of GFP-LC3, up-regulation of LC3-II/LC3-I and down-regulation of SQSMT1/BECN1, and knocking down of ARL3 inbibits autophagy, which suggested that ARL3 is necessary for autophagy. this study presents a comprehensive evaluation of the subcellular localization for ARL3 and provides important on understanding the functions of ARL3.

AB Erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a preferred biomarker for the detection of organophosphorus poisoning. Acetylthiocholine (ATCh) is the most popular substrate for the detection of AChE activity. However, oximolysis is a prominent feature with ATCh. In this context, we have searched alternative substrates for AChE using in silico tools for screening of a better substrate. The in silico approach was performed to understand the fitness and the Total Interaction Energy (TIE) of substrates for AChE. The alternative substrates for AChE were screened in terms of high Goldscore and favorable TIE in comparison to acetylcholine (ACh)-AChE complex and other relevant esterases. Among the screened substrates, 1-Naphthyl acetate (1-NA) exhibited the most favorable interaction with AChE in terms of highest TIE and corresponding high Goldscore. The Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulation of the 1-NA-AChE complex showed a stable complex formation over a period of 5 ns. The results obtained in the in silico studies were validated in vitro using pure erythrocyte AChE and hemolysate. We observed 1-NA to be a better alternative substrate for AChE than ATCh in terms of lower Km value. Its specificity appeared at least similar to ATCh. Therefore, we propose that 1-NA can be an attractive chromogenic substrate for the measurement of AChE activity, and it possess the potential to detect organophosphorus pesticide (OP) poisoning.

AB Increasing numbers of laboratories develop new methods based on gas-liquid and high-performance liquid chromatography to determine serum concentrations of oxygenated cholesterol metabolites such as 7 alpha-, 24(S)-, and 27-hydroxycholesterol. We initiated a first international descriptive oxycholesterol (OCS) survey in 2013 and a second interventional survey 2014 in order to compare levels of OCS reported by different laboratories and to define possible sources of analytical errors. In 2013 a set of two lyophilized serum pools (A and B) was sent to nine laboratories in different countries for OCS measurement utilizing their own standard stock solutions. In 2014 eleven laboratories were requested to determine OCS concentrations in lyophilized pooled sera (C and D) utilizing the same provided standard stock solutions of OCS. The participating laboratories submitted results obtained after capillary gas-liquid chromatography-mass selective detection with either epicoprostanol or deuterium labelled sterols as internal standards and high-performance liquid chromatography with mass selective detection and deuterated OCS as internal standard. Each participant received a clear overview of the results in form of Youden-Plots and basic statistical evaluation in its used unit. The coefficients of variation of the concentrations obtained by all laboratories using their individual methods were 58.5-73.3% (survey 1), 56.8-60.3% (survey 2); 36.2-35.8% (survey 1), 56.6-59.8, (survey 2); 61.1-197.7% (survey 1), 47.2-74.2% (survey 2) for 24(S)-, 27-, and 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol, respectively. We are surprised by the very great differences between the laboratories, even under conditions when the same standards were used. The values of OCS's must be evaluated in relation to the analytical technique used, the efficiency of the ample separation and the nature of the internal standard used. Quantification of the calibration solution and inappropriate internal standards could be identified as major causes for the high variance in the reported results from the different laboratories. A harmonisation of analytical standard methods is highly needed. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Cholesterol and its oxygenated metabolites, such as oxysterols, are intensively investigated as potential players in the pathophysiology of brain disorder. Altered oxysterol levels have been described in patients with numerous neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, and Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome. Recent studies have shown that Autism Spectrum Disorders are associated with disruption of cholesterol metabolism. The present study aimed at investigating the profile of oxysterols in plasma and their association with clinical parameters in patients with Autism Spectrum Disorders. Thirty-six children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and thirty-eight healthy children, from Sfax (a southern area of Tunisia) matched for age and sex, were included in the study. The severity of Autism Spectrum Disorders was evaluated using the childhood autism rating scale. Standard lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol), serum glucose, high-sensitive C-reactive protein and orosomucoid levels were measured utilizing standard techniques. Oxysterol levels were measured by isotope-dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Standard lipid profile, serum glucose, high-sensitive C-reactive protein and orosomucoid levels were similar between the two studied populations. Compared to the control group, children with Autism Spectrum Disorders showed a significant higher plasma level of 24-hydroxycholesterol, while borderline significance was observed for 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol, and 25-hydroxycholersterol. In patients, 24-hydroxycholesterol was inversely correlated with age. Multivariate analysis showed that high plasma levels of 24-hydroxycholesterol are independent risk factors for Autism Spectrum Disorders. On the other hand, an analysis of the receiver's operating characteristics proved that the measured parameters recorded satisfactory levels of specificity and sensitivity.
   The present study provides evidence that Autism Spectrum Disorders are associated with altered levels in circulating oxysterols. The finding that 24-hydroxycholesterol is an independent risk factor for the disease and suggests the use of this oxysterol as a diagnostic tool in Autism Spectrum Disorders.

AB Oxygenation products of cholesterol, named oxysterols, were suspected since the 20th century to be involved in carcinogenesis. Among the family of oxysterol molecules, cholesterol-5,6-epoxides (5,6-EC) retained the attention of scientists because they contain a putative alkylating epoxide group. However, studies failed into demonstrating that 5,6-EC were direct carcinogens and revealed a surprising chemical stability and unreactivity towards nucleophiles in standard conditions. Analyses of 5,6-EC metabolism in normal cells showed that they were extensively transformed into cholestane-3 beta,5 alpha,6 beta-triol (CT) by the cholesterol-5,6-epoxide hydrolase (ChEH). Studies performed in cancer cells showed that CT was additionally metabolized into an oxysterol identified as the 6-oxo-cholestan-3 beta,5 alpha-diol (OCDO), by the 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase of type 2 (HSD2), the enzyme which inactivates cortisol into cortisone. Importantly, OCDO was shown to display tumor promoter properties in breast cancers, by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor, and independently of their estrogen receptor status, revealing the existence of a new tumorigenic pathway centered on 5,6-EC. In breast tumors from patients, OCDO production as well as the expression of the enzymes involved in the pathway producing OCDO, namely ChEH subunits and HSD2, were higher compared to normal tissues, and overexpression of these enzymes correlate with a higher risk of patient death, indicating that this onco-metabolism is of major importance to breast cancer pathology. Herein, we will review the actual knowledge and the future trends in OCDO chemistry, biochemistry, metabolism and mechanism of action and will discuss the impact of OCDO discovery on new anticancer therapeutic strategies.

AB The involvement of organelles in cell death is well established especially for endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes and mitochondria. However, the role of the peroxisome is not well known, though peroxisomal dysfunction favors a rupture of redox equilibrium. To study the role of peroxisomes in cell death, 158 N murine oligodendrocytes were treated with 7-ketocholesterol (7 KC: 25-50 mu M, 24 h). The highest concentration is known to induce oxiapoptophagy (OXIdative stress + APOPTOsis + autoPHAGY), whereas the lowest concentration does not induce cell death. In those conditions (with 7 KC: 50 mu M) morphological, topographical and functional peroxisome alterations associated with modifications of the cytoplasmic distribution of mitochondria, with mitochondrial dysfunction (loss of transmembrane mitochondrial potential, decreased level of cardiolipins) and oxidative stress were observed: presence of peroxisomes with abnormal sizes and shapes similar to those observed in Zellweger fibroblasts, lower cellular level of ABCD3, used as a marker of peroxisomal mass, measured by flow cytometry, lower mRNA and protein levels (measured by RT-qPCR and western blotting) of ABCD1 and ABCD3 (two ATP-dependent peroxisomal transporters), and of ACOX1 and MFP2 enzymes, and lower mRNA level of DHAPAT, involved in peroxisomal beta-oxidation and plasmalogen synthesis, respectively, and increased levels of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA: C24:0, C24:1, C26:0 and C26:1, quantified by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry) metabolized by peroxisomal beta-oxidation. In the presence of 7 KC (25 mu M), slight mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress were found, and no induction of apoptosis was detected; however, modifications of the cytoplasmic distribution of mitochondria and clusters of mitochondria were detected. The peroxisomal alterations observed with 7 KC (25 mu M) were similar to those with 7 KC (50 mu M). In addition, data obtained by transmission electron microcopy and immunofluorescence microscopy by dual staining with antibodies raised against p62, involved in autophagy, and ABCD3, support that 7 KC (25-50 mu M) induces pexophagy. 7 KC (25-50 mu M)-induced side effects were attenuated by alpha-tocopherol but not by alpha-tocotrienol, whereas the anti-oxidant properties of these molecules determined with the FRAP assay were in the same range. These data provide evidences that 7 KC, at concentrations inducing or not cell death, triggers morphological, topographical and functional peroxisomal alterations associated with minor or major mitochondrial changes.

AB Oxysterols play important roles in development and diseases, but can be highly challenging to analyze. To ensure satisfactory measurements, oxysterols must typically be separated with chromatography prior to detection. Here, we will devote attention to the chromatography of oxysterols, focusing on gas chromatography and liquid chromatography. We will present the role of stationary phases, mobile phases, and dimensions and geometries of particles/columns. We discuss how these parameters may affect the chromatography, regarding factors such as speed and resolution. Finally, we present some less explored avenues for separation of oxysterols.

AB Human steroid hormones are involved in many aspects of physiology and have long been known to exert rapid and delayed effects. They are lipophilic molecules which can be incorporated into the lipid membranes. Through non-covalent interactions they can alter the properties of the membrane, including fluidity, lipid raft formation and others. In this review, different biophysical techniques were described to study the interaction of human steroid hormones with biological and biomimetic membranes such as differential scanning calorimetry, electron paramagnetic resonance, fluorescence spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The aim of this review is to overview the results of these complementary biophysical techniques summarizing the effects of these hormones on thermotropic and dynamic membrane properties. Meanwhile, the disorder induced by human steroid hormones is discussed in terms of hydrophobicity and chemical structure. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Given that literature data may give inconsistent results on the effect of a drug on lipid membrane properties, this work aims to investigate the impact of the liposome composition and experimental protocol design on glucocorticoids (GRs: cortisol, cortisone, fludrocortisone acetate, methylprednisolone, prednisolone and prednisone)-modulating membrane fluidity and permeability. GRs-loaded liposomes consisting of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and cholesterol (CHOL) were prepared by reverse phase evaporation technique (REV) at DPPC:CHOL:GR molar ratios of 100:100:2.5, and 100:100:10. The formulations were characterized for their size and homogeneity, encapsulation efficiency and loading rates of GRs, incorporation rates and loading rates of DPPC and CHOL. Changes in DPPC membrane fluidity (CHOL% 0, 10, 20, 30 and 100) after exposure to methylprednisolone were monitored by using 5-and 16-doxyl stearic acids (DSA) as spin probes. For permeability studies, the above-mentioned GRs-loaded liposomes and the preformed liposomes exposed to GRs (2.5 mol%) were compared for the leakage of an encapsulated fluorescent dye, sulforhodamine B (SRB), at 37 degrees C in buffer (pH 7.5) containing NaCI. The SRB release kinetics were analyzed by the Higuchi model for two release phases (from 0 to 10 h, and from 10 to 48 h). All formulations exhibited a monodispersed size distribution of liposomes with a mean particle value close to 0.4 mu m, also the DPPC and CHOL were highly incorporated (>95%). High loading rate values of DPPC and CHOL were also obtained. Except for fludrocortisone acetate (51%) and prednisolone (77%), high loading rate values of GRs were obtained (>81%). Fluidity and permeability studies showed that the GR concentration, CHOL content, experimental protocol design including the period of incubation represent critical parameters to be considered in analyzing the effect of drugs on the membrane properties.

AB The propagation of nerve impulses in myelinated nerve fibers depends on a number of factors involving the myelin and neural axons. In several neurodegenerative diseases, nerve impulses can be affected by the structural and biochemical characteristics of the myelin sheath and the activity of ion channels located in the nodes of Ranvier. Though it is generally accepted that lipid disorders are involved in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, little is known about their impact on nerve impulses. Cholesterol oxide derivatives (also called oxysterols), which are either formed enzymatically or as a result of cholesterol auto-oxidation or both, are often found in abnormal levels in the brain and body fluids of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. This leads to the question of whether these molecules, which can accumulate in the plasma membrane and influence its structure and functions (fluidity, membrane proteins activities, signaling pathways), can have an impact on nerve impulses. It is currently thought that the ability of oxysterols to modulate nerve impulses could be explained by their influence on the characteristics and production of myelin as well as the functionality of Na+ and K+ channels.

AB Dihydroxycholesterols such as 7 alpha,25-dihydroxysterols (7 alpha,25-OHC) and 7 alpha,27-OHC are generated from cholesterol by the enzymes CH25H, CYP7B1 and CYP27A1 in steady state but also in the context of inflammation. The G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2), also known as GPR183, senses these oxysterols and induces chemotactic migration of immune cells towards higher concentrations of these ligands. We recently showed that these ligands are upregulated in the CNS in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis and that EBI2 enhanced early infiltration of encephalitogenic T cells into the CNS. In this short-review we discuss the role of dihydroxysterol-sensing by immune cells in neuroinflammation. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB Little is known about K+ regulation playing major roles in the propagation of nerve impulses, as well as in apoptosis and inflammasome activation involved in neurodegeneration. As increased levels of 7-ketocholesterol (7KC), 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC) and tetracosanoic acid (C24:0) have been observed in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, we studied the effect of 24 and/or 48 h of treatment with 7KC, 24S-OHC and C24:0 on Kv3.1b potassium channel level, intracellular K+ concentration, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and plasma membrane permeability in 158N oligodendrocytes and BV-2 microglial cells. In 158N cells, whereas increased level of Kv3.1b was only observed with 7KC and 24S-OHC but not with C24:0 at 24 h, an intracellular accumulation of K+ was always detected. In BV-2 cells treated with 7KC, 24S-OHC and C24:0, Kv3.1b level was only increased at 48 h; intracellular K+ accumulation was found at 24 h with 7KC, 24S-OHC and C24:0, and only with C24:0 at 48 h. Positive correlations between Kv3.1b level and intracellular K+ concentration were observed in 158N cells in the presence of 7KC and 24S-OHC, and in 7KC-treated BV-2 cells at 48 h. Positive correlations were also found between Kv3.1b or the intracellular K+ concentration, overproduction of reactive oxygen species, loss of transmembrane mitochondrial potential and increased plasma membrane permeability in 158N and BV-2 cells. Our data support that the lipid environment affects Kv3.1b channel expression and/or functionality, and that the subsequent rupture of K+ homeostasis is relied with oligodendrocytes and microglial cells damages.

AB Huntington's Disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by abnormal polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin (mHtt) protein leading to degeneration of striatal neurons. Excitotoxicity, consecutive to overstimulation of N-methyl o-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) has a pivotal role in many neurological disorders including HD. Mutant Htt causes enhanced NMDA sensitivity, alteration of NMDAR expression and localization in neurons. Excitotoxic events initiate neuronal death in numerous ways, including activation of apoptotic cascades. Among the NMDAR subunits involved in glutamatergic-mediated excitotoxicity, GluN2B has been extensively reported. In addition to excitotoxicity, alteration of cholesterol metabolism has been observed in HD, with a decrease of cholesterol precursor synthesis along with an increase of cholesterol accumulation, which is deleterious for neurons. Expression of Cholesterol Hydroxylase enzyme, CYP46A1, which converts cholesterol into 24 S-hydroxycholesterol is down-regulated in HD. We found that CYP46A1 overexpression is beneficial in HD neurons and mouse model, but the mechanisms involved still remain unclear. In this study we addressed the effect of CYP46A1 on NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity in HD primary neurons and its role in modulating cholesterol and localization of GLUN2B in lipid rafts. We showed that CYP46A1 is protective against NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity in two different HD neuronal cell models. Cholesterol as well as GluN2B level in lipid raft, are significantly increased by mHtt. Despite a clear effect of CYP46A1 in reducing cholesterol content in lipid raft extracts from wild type neurons, CYP46A1 overexpression in HD neurons could not normalize the increased cholesterol levels in lipid rafts. This study highlights the beneficial role of CYP46A1 against NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity and gives further insights into the cellular mechanisms underlying CYP46A1-mediated neuroprotection.

AB Dihydroxyoxocholestenoic acids are intermediates in bile acid biosynthesis. Here, using liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry, we confirm the identification of 7 alpha,24-dihydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-en-26-oic and 7 alpha,25-dihydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-en-26-oic acids in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) based on comparisons to authentic standards and of 7 alpha,12 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-en-26-oic and 7 alpha,x-dihydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-en-26-oic (where hydroxylation is likely on C-22 or C-23) based on exact mass measurement and multistage fragmentation. Surprisingly, patients suffering from the inborn error of metabolism cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, where the enzyme CYP27A1, which normally introduces the (25 R)26-carboxylic acid group to the sterol side-chain, is defective still synthesise 7 alpha,24-dihydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-en-26-oic acid and also both 25 R- and 25 S-epimers of 7 alpha,12 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-en-26-oic acid. We speculate that the enzymes CYP46A1 and CYP3A4 may have C-26 carboxylase activity to generate these acids. In patients suffering from hereditary spastic paraplegia type 5 the CSF concentrations of the 7 alpha,24- and 7 alpha,25-dihydroxy acids are reduced, suggesting an involvement of CYP7B1 in their biosynthesis in brain.

AB The electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes, e-cigs) have become the most sought-after alternative to the traditional cigarettes, partly due to the widespread perception of safety. However, the high temperature reached by e-cig solutions can generate toxic compounds, some of which are listed as known human carcinogens. To evaluate the impact of e-cig aerosol on rat brain lipid profile, twenty male Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to 11 cycles/day (E-cig group), to consume 1 mL/day of e-liquid, for 5 days/week up to 8 weeks. Ten rats were sacrificed after 4 weeks (4w) and ten at the end of treatment (8w). The composition of total fatty acids, sterols and oxysterols of the lipid fraction of rat brains, was analyzed. The results of the E-cig group were compared with those of the control group (not exposed). After 8 weeks, the saturated fatty acids significantly raised up to 7.35 mg/g tissue, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased reaching 3.17 mg/g. The e-cig vaping increased both palmitic (3.43 mg/g) and stearic acids (3.82 mg/g), while a significant decrement of arachidonic (1.32 mg/g) and docosahexaenoic acids (1.00 mg/g) was found. Atherogenic (0.5) and thrombogenic (1.12) indices also increased in 8w treated animals. The e-cig aerosol significantly impacted the cholesterol homeostasis, since the latter at 8w (21.57 mg/g) was significantly lower than control (24.56 mg/g); moreover, a significant increase of 7-dehydrocholesterol (1.87 mg/g) was also denoted in e-cig group. The e-cig aerosol also reduced the oxysterol formation (19.55 mu g/g) after 4 weeks of exposure, except for triol and 5 alpha,6 alpha-epoxycholesterol (alpha-EC). The principal component analysis (PCA) separated all E-cig from control groups, evidencing that oxysterols (except triol and 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24(S)-HC)) were inversely correlated to 7-DHC and TI. The present research revealed that e-cigs aerosol affected the lipid and cholesterol homeostasis in rat brain, which could contribute to the new occurrence of some neurodegenerative diseases.

AB Oxysterols, oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol, are formed in the human body or ingested. Experimental evidence suggests that due to their diverse functions, e.g. modulating the activity of receptors such as liver X receptors, oxysterol-binding and metabolizing proteins, and several ATP binding cassette transporters, oxysterols may contribute to a number of human disorders including cancer. Genetic variability of oxysterol pathways represents another side of this process, affecting carcinogenesis and cancer progression. This review summarizes information about both the physiological role of oxysterol pathway genes and observed associations between their genetic variability and cancer incidence, progression, and therapy outcome. Besides candidate gene studies, results of genome-wide association studies are presented as well. The survey of available data shows some potential genetic biomarkers that, if clinically validated, may allow the stratification of individuals into genetically defined groups for prediction of individual cancer risk and subsequent screening strategies for early diagnosis.

AB Cancer is a global problem with no sign that incidences are reducing. The great costs associated with curing cancer, through developing novel treatments and applying patented therapies, is an increasing burden to developed and developing nations alike. These financial and societal problems will be alleviated by research efforts into prevention, or treatments that utilise off-patent or repurposed agents.
   Phytosterols are natural components of the diet found in an array of seeds, nuts and vegetables and have been added to several consumer food products for the management of cardio-vascular disease through their ability to lower LDL-cholesterol levels. In this review, we provide a connected view between the fields of structural biophysics and cellular and molecular biology to evaluate the growing evidence that phytosterols impair oncogenic pathways in a range of cancer types. The current state of understanding of how phytosterols alter the biophysical properties of plasma membrane is described, and the potential for phytosterols to be repurposed from cardio-vascular to oncology therapeutics. Through an overview of the types of biophysical and molecular biology experiments that have been performed to date, this review informs the reader of the molecular and biophysical mechanisms through which phytosterols could have anti-cancer properties via their interactions with the plasma cell membrane. We also outline emerging and under-explored areas such as computational modelling, improved biomimetic membranes and ex vivo tissue evaluation. Focus of future research in these areas should improve understanding, not just of phytosterols in cancer cell biology but also to give insights into the interaction between the plasma membrane and the genome. These fields are increasingly providing meaningful biological and clinical data but iterative experiments between molecular biology assays, biosynthetic membrane studies and computational membrane modelling improve and refine our understanding of the role of different sterol components of the plasma membrane.

AB Cymbopogon species are used as traditional remedies in Burkina Faso for treating several diseases. We aimed to study the effects of their essential oils on cancer cell lines. For that purpose, Cymbopogon citratus (DC.) Stapf. and Cymbopogon giganteus Chiov. were studied for their essential oils after various chemical extractions. Antioxidant, potential anti-inflammatory action (inhibition of lipoxygenase) and cytotoxic activities were also tested on various prostate cancer and glioblastoma cell lines. Thirty-three compounds were identified in the essential oil of C. giganteus: Limonene (19.33%), Mentha-1(7),8-dien-2-ol cis (17.34%), Mentha-1(7),8-dien-2-ol trans (13.95%), trans-Mentha-2,8-diene-para-ol 1 (13.91%) and Mentha-2,8-diene-l-ol, cis-para (8.10%) were the most abundant. C. citratus essential oil contained 15 compounds and the major ones were geranial/citral A (48.18%) and neral/citral B (34.37%). Essential oil of C. citratus showed the highest ability to scavenge DPPH+ radicals (approximately 68% at 8 mg/mL) while C. giganteus exhibited the highest capability to reduce ABTS(+) (0.59 mu molET/g). The essential oil of C. citratus was the most effective on prostate cell lines LNCaP (IC50 = 6.36 mu g/ml) and PC-3 (IC50 = 32.1 mu g/ml), and on glioblastoma cell lines (SF-767 (IC50 = 45.13 mu g/ml) and SF-763 (IC50 = 172.05 mu g/ml). Interestingly, the activity of essential oil of C. citratus was statistically equal to that of its major component, citral. Combination of both oils showed antagonist, additive, indifferent and synergistic effects on LNCaP, PC-3, SF-767 and SF-763 cell lines, respectively. In conclusion, plants from the traditional medicine in Burkina Faso could be of interest for identifying new compounds, such as citral, for the treatment of prostate cancer and glioblastoma.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer in the western world, affecting 1 out of approximately 22 people in their lifetime. Several epidemiological studies suggest a positive association between high plasma cholesterol levels and colorectal cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms by which cholesterol may alter the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) are ill-defined as the cholesterol lowering drugs statins do not appear to decrease a patient's risk of developing colorectal cancer. Cholesterol is metabolized to active derivatives including cholesterol oxidization products (COP), known as oxysterols, which have been shown to alter cellular proliferation. These metabolites and not cholesterol per se, may therefore affect the risk of developing colorectal cancer. The cholesterol metabolite or the oxysterol 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) is the most abundant oxysterol in the plasma and has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of several cancers including breast and prostate cancer. However, the role of 27-OHC in colorectal cancer has not been investigated. We treated Caco2 and SW620, two well characterized colon cancer cells with low, physiological and high concentrations of 27-OHC, and found that 27-OHC reduces cellular proliferation in these cells. We also found that the effects of 27-OHC on cell proliferation are not due to cellular cytotoxicity or apoptotic cellular death. Additionally, 27-OHC-induced reduction in cell proliferation is independent of actions on its target nuclear receptors, liver-X-receptors (LXR) and estrogen receptors (ER) activation. Instead, our study demonstrates that 27-OHC significantly decreases AKT activation, a major protein kinase involved in the pathogenesis of cancer as it regulates cell cycle progression, protein synthesis, and cellular survival. Our data shows that treatment with 27-OHC substantially decreases the activation of AKT by reducing levels of its active form, p-AKT, in Caco2 cells but not SW620 cells. All-together, our results show for the first time that the cholesterol metabolite 27-OHC reduces cell proliferation in colorectal cancer cells.

AB Although 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC) plays an important role to maintain homeostasis of cholesterol in the brain, it induces neuronal cell death at high concentrations. 24S-OHC-induced cell death was suppressed by gamma-tocopherol (gamma-Toc) but not by y-tocotrienol (gamma-Toc3) in a similar way to atocopherol (alpha-Toc) and alpha-tocotrienol (alpha-Toc3) in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Both gamma-Toc and gamma-Toc3 significantly inhibited cumene hydroperoxide-induced cell death, as previously shown in the case of alpha-Toc and alpha-Toc3. Lipid droplet-like structure formation induced by 24S-OHC was suppressed by neither gamma-Toc nor gamma-Toc3. The phosphorylation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was induced by 24S-OHC, which was suppressed by CaMKII phosphorylation-site inhibitor mM3 but not by calmodulin-binding-site inhibitor KN62. A calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM, inhibited calcium ionophore A23187-induced CaMKII phosphorylation but not 24S-OHC-induced CaMKII phosphorylation. Receptorinteracting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) phosphorylation induced by 24S-OHC was not inhibited by either mM3 or KN62, suggesting that CaMKII activation does not affect RIPK1 phosphorylation. Knockdown of RIPK1 using siRNA induced not only inhibition of CaMKII phosphorylation but also reduction of total CaMKII protein levels, suggesting that RIPK1 may regulate CaMKII signalling. 24S-OHC-induced RIPK1 phosphorylation was inhibited by neither alpha-Toc nor alpha-Toc3. In contrast, CaMKII phosphorylation induced by 24S-OHC was significantly suppressed by alpha-Toc but not by alpha-Toc3. These results suggest that CaMKII activation is involved in the mechanism of 24S-OHC-induced cell death and that Toc inhibits the cell death via inhibition of CaMKII activation through a RIPK1 phosphorylation-independent pathway.

AB Some oxysterols resulting either from enzymatic oxidation or autoxidation of cholesterol are associated with age-related diseases including neurodegenerative diseases. Among these oxysterols, 7 beta-hydroxycholesterol (7 beta-OHC) is often found at increased levels in patients. It is therefore important to identify molecules or mixtures of molecules to prevent 7 beta-OHC-induced side effects. Consequently, murine oligodendrocytes (158N) were cultured in the absence or presence of 7 beta-OHC (20 mu g/mL, 24 h) with or without a natural oil extracted from sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) eggs known for its biological activity. Firstly, the chemical composition of this oil was determined using P-31 NMR and GC-MS. Secondly, this oil was used to reduce 7 beta-OHC-induced side effects. To this end, the oil (160 mu g/mL) was added to the culture medium of 158N cells 2 h before 7 beta-OHC. The effects of 7 beta-OHC with or without the oil on cell viability were studied with the MTT test. Photometric methods were used to analyze antioxidant enzyme activities, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), as well as the generation of lipid peroxidation products (malondialdehyde (MDA), conjugated dienes (CDs)) and protein oxidation product (carbonylated proteins (CPs)). Gas chromatography was used to determine the fatty acid profile. With 7 beta-OHC, an induction of cell death associated with oxidative stress (alteration of GPx and SOD activities) was observed; an overproduction of lipid peroxidation products (MDA and CDs) and CPs was also revealed. Sea urchin egg oil attenuated 7 beta-OHC-induced cytotoxicity: 7 beta-OHC-induced cell death was reduced, GPx and SOD activities were normalized, and lower levels of MDA, CDs and CPs were produced. In addition, whereas a disturbed fatty acid profile was observed with 7 beta-OHC, similar fatty acid profiles were found in control cells and in cells cultured with 7 beta-OHC associated with sea urchin egg oil. These data demonstrate the protective activities of sea urchin egg oil against 7 beta-OHC-induced side effects on 158N cells, supporting the concept that this oil may have benefits in the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB A growing bulk of evidence suggests that cholesterol oxidation products, known as oxysterols, are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of major chronic diseases, including atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. Oxysterols are involved in various key steps of these complex processes, mainly thanks to their ability to act through up-regulation of oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell toxicity.
   This review summarizes the current knowledge of the effects induced by these compounds on cells, after their accumulation in the arterial wall, brain, and intestine. This evidence might help to develop innovative strategies to counteract the progression of these chronic inflammatory human diseases.

AB Oxidized LDL (OxLDL) that are enriched in products of lipid peroxidation including oxysterols have been shown to induce cellular oxidative stress and cytotoxicity therefore accelerating atheroma plaque formation. Upon oxLDL exposure of THP-1 macrophages, intracellular oxidation of LDL derived-cholesterol as well as endogenous cholesterol was increased. The oxysterols intracellularly produced were efficiently exported to HDL whereas apolipoprotein A1 was inefficient. These findings prompted us to investigate the consequences of modification of HDL by oxidation and glycation as observed in type 2 diabetes with respect to oxysterol and cholesterol efflux. We show that efflux of oxysterols was significantly impaired after in vitro oxidation and glycoxidation of HDL whereas glycation alone had no impact. Cholesterol efflux was only slightly decreased by oxHDL or glycoxidized HDL and not changed with glycated HDL. The defect of HDL towards oxysterol efflux was also observed with HDL isolated from diabetic subjects as compared to healthy controls. These findings support a deleterious cellular retention of oxysterols due to dysfunctional HDL in type 2 diabetes.

AB The variability of molecular signatures and predictive low molecular weight markers of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in different populations are poorly understood. Thus, in a large sample with 4763 people we compare the molecular signatures and metabolites with diagnostic relevance in plasma and urine of CKD patients of different geographical origins. From an integrated model based on dynamic networks and multivariate statistics, metabolites with predictive value obtained from targeted and untargeted molecular analysis, interactions between metabolic pathways affected by CKD, and the methodological quality of metabolomic studies were analyzed. The metabolites 3-methylhistidine, citrulline, kynurenine, p-cresol sulfate, urea, and citrate presented consistent expression in all population groups. Only increased kynurenine and p-cresol sulfate in plasma samples obtained acceptable scores as CKD bio-markers, independent of geographic origin. Metabolites such as leucine, alanine, isoleucine, serine, histidine, and citrate were nodal points, indicating that protein metabolism pathways are similarly impaired in Asian, European and North American patients. Based on our integrated model, we show that the metabolome of CKD patients exhibits a strong geographic influence, leading to unique metabolic signatures. Contrary to the likelihood of molecular similarities between geographically distinct populations, metabolic convergences in protein metabolism pathways and the molecules kynurenine and p-cresol sulfate were relevant as general predictors of CKD. In general, the quality assessment indicated that the current evidence is based on research models with variable methodological quality, whose limitations described in this study should be considered in the refinement of molecular approaches.

AB 1 beta-hydroxyl-5 alpha-chloro-8-epi-xanthatin (XTT), a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from Xanthium sibiricum, possessed potent cytotoxicity on cancer cells in vitro. The objective of this study was to investigate the anti-tumor effect and underlying mechanisms of XTT on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Firstly, XTT inhibited the cell growth and induced apoptosis in human HCC cells, which was associated with the induction of Bax and cleaved-caspase-3, inhibition of Bcl-2 and survivin expression. Importantly, XTT induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), and depletion of glutathione (GSH) in HCC cells through covalently modification of GSH. Furthermore, XTT caused obvious activation of extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and inactivation of Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) in HCC cells. ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine abrogated the effects of XTT on ERK/p38 MAPK activation and JAK2/STAT3 inhibition, and rescued HCC cells from XTT-induced apoptosis. Additionally, inhibitors of ERK/p38 MAPKs or activator of JAK2/STAT3 partially abolished XTT-mediated effect. In summary, XTT inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in HCC cells through ROS-mediated ERK/p38 MAPK activation and JAK2/STAT3 inhibition by GSH depletion. These findings also show the therapeutic potential of XTT in HCC. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM). All rights reserved.

AB Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease Apn1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is known as a key player of the base excision DNA repair (BER) pathway in yeast. BER is initiated by DNA glycosylases, whereas Apn1 can start DNA repair individually in the nucleotide incision repair (NIR) pathway. The aim of this research was to elucidate kinetic and structural dynamic aspects of Apn1 involvement in the NIR process. One of the key characteristics of AP endonuclease's interactions is known to be divalent metal ions playing a part of a cofactor. Well-studied human APE1 employs Mg2+ ions, with metal ion concentration's affecting enzymatic activity exerted by APE1. In our study, we aimed to test the effect of the Mg2+ ion on Apn1's NIR catalysis by examining structural dynamics of DNA during the interaction in real time using the stopped-flow technique. To test NIR activity of Apn1, deoxyribooligonucleotide duplexes containing a 5,6-dihydro-2'-deoxyuridine (DHU) residue were employed as substrates. A 2-aminopurine (2-aPu) residue was a reporter group fluorescence intensity of which was detected during Apn1 -DNA interactions. NIR activity of both WT and H83A Apn1 was found to be arrested during the interaction with a DNA duplex containing the 2-aPu residue upstream of DHU. We conducted molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the structural features of complexes of the enzyme with DHU-containing DNAs. The NIR recruiting S. cerevisiae Apn1 proceeds via multistep rearrangements of the complex of Apn1 with a DHU-containing DNA substrate and results in the incised product of the reaction. For wild-type Apn1, the catalytic rate constants do not depend on the Mg2+ concentration, i.e., they are equal in NIR and BER buffers, with equilibrium association constant K-a being 10-fold higher in NIR buffer.
   Our data reveal more delicate regulation of Apn1's NIR activity due to the more complicated kinetic mechanism, as compared to BER. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM). All rights reserved.

AB The roles and mechanisms of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells sternness and chemotherapeutic sensitivity are unclear. Here, Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect the lncRNA THOR expression in NPC and normal adjacent tissues, adherent NPC cells and non-adherent NPC spheres, and we found that THOR was significantly increased in NPC tissues and non-adherent NPC spheres. Further in vitro and in vivo experiments were carried out and identified that knockdown of THOR attenuated NPC cells sternness, characterized as the decrease of spheres formation ability, cell proliferation, migration, invasion, sternness markers expression and tumor initiation, and enhanced cisplatin sensitivity of NPC cells. Mechanistically, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), immunofluorescence and luciferase reporter analysis indicated that THOR could enhance YAP transcriptional activity via directly binding to YAP and suppressing its translocation from nuclear to cytoplasm. Notably, overexpression of YAP rescued the inhibition of THOR knockdown on NPC cells and spheres sternness and promotion on cisplatin sensitivity. Thus, our results demonstrate that lncRNA THOR could attenuate cisplatin sensitivity of NPC cells by enhancing cells sternness through promoting YAP transcriptional activity.

AB Based on recent advances on the Ca2+-activated F1FO-ATPase features, a novel multistep mechanism involving the mitochondrial F1FO complex in the formation and opening of the still enigmatic mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), is proposed. MPTP opening makes the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) permeable to ions and solutes and, through cascade events, addresses cell fate to death. Since MPTP forms when matrix Ca2+ concentration rises and ATP is hydrolyzed by the F1FO-ATPase, conformational changes, triggered by Ca2+ insertion in F-1, may be transmitted to F-O and locally modify the IMM curvature. These events would cause F1FO-ATPase dimer dissociation and MPTP opening. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM). All rights reserved.

In order to deal with these complications, we designed a new therapeutic strategy, i.e. coculture system containing human amnion-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HAMSCs) and human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (HBMSCs). Two in vitro coculture models, transwell and mixed cocultures, were proposed for 7 days with variable HAMSCs: HBMSCs ratios. Then, supernatant from each coculture was used to reverse the deficiency of HBMSCs and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) impaired by high glucose and palmitic acid (GP). We found that glucolipotoxicity caused by GP remarkably inhibited cell proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, as well as induced the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in HBMSCs. Meanwhile, glucolipotoxicity suppressed cell proliferation, tube formation capacity and angiogenic potential of HUVECs. Though, HAMSCs/HBMSCs coculture system reduced HBMSCs dysfunction by antioxidant properties and promoted angiogenesis in HUVECs. The mixed HAMSCs/HBMSCs coculture at the optimal ratio of 3/1 showed significantly greater cell proliferation, antioxidant properties, osteogenic and angiogenic differentiation than HBMSCs or HUVECs alone. In conclusion, the current coculture system of HAMSCs/HBMSCs can be a potential therapeutic material for advancing bone and vascular regeneration against DM-induced glucolipotoxicity.

AB One-carbon metabolism is critical to pregnancy outcomes, because it determines the availability of nutrients involved in cell divisions and DNA methylation. The aim of this study was to analyze how 50% prenatal calorie restriction affected one-carbon metabolism in pregnant Wistar rats of the F0 to F2 generations. Mean choline (p <0.001), betaine (p < 0.001), and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) (p < 0.05) concentrations were respectively about 40%, 45%, and 20% lower in the F0_R (R - restricted diet) than in the F0_C (C - control diet). Homocysteine, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and trimethylamine oxide concentrations were unaffected. In the F1_R, the SAM-to-SAH ratio was 25% higher (p < 0.05) than in the F1_C. No differences between the C and R groups were observed in the F2 generation. The SAM concentrations in the F1_R were higher than in the F0_R and the F2_R (p < 0.01). The relative transcript levels of Matta, Bhmt, Cbs, Pemt, and Mthfr were only slightly affected by the diet, with changes of less than a factor of 2.0. Cbs activity in the F2_R was significantly higher than in the F2_C (p < 0.001). Food deprivation may affect one-carbon metabolism in pregnant rats, but it does not stimulate persistent metabolic changes that can be observed during the pregnancy of their progeny of the F1 or F2 generations.

AB Peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases (GTase) of family 51 are essential enzymes for the synthesis of the glycan chains of the bacterial cell wall. They are considered potential antibacterial target, but discovery of inhibitors was hampered so far by the lack of efficient and affordable screening assay. Here we used Staphylococcus aureus MtgA to introduce a single tryptophan reporter residue in selected positions flanking the substrates binding cavity of the protein. We selected a mutant (Y181W) that shows strong fluorescence quenching in the presence of moenomycin A and two lipid II analogs inhibitors. The assay provides a simple method to study GTase-ligand interactions and can be used as primary high throughput screening of GTase inhibitors without the need for lipid II substrate or reporter ligands.

AB Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMOylation) is a reversible post-translational modification, which plays important roles in numerous biological processes. SUMO could be covalently attached to target proteins in an isopeptide bond manner that occurs via a lysine epsilon-amino group on the target proteins and the glycine on SUMO C-terminus. This covalent binding could affect the subcellular localization and stability of target proteins. SUMO modification can be reversed by members of the Sentrin/SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs) family, which are highly evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human. SENP2, a member of the SENPs family, mainly plays a physiological function in the nucleus. SENP2 can promote maturity of the SUMO and deSUMOylate for single-SUMO modified or poly-SUMO modified proteins. SENP2 can affect the related biological processes through its peptidase activity or the amino terminal transcriptional repression domain. It plays important roles by inhibiting or activating some molecular functions. Therefore, the research achievements of SENP2 are reviewed in order to understand its related functions and the underlying molecular mechanisms and provide a clue for future research on SENP2.

AB A high failure rate of titanium implants in diabetic patients has been indicated in clinical evidences. Excessive oxidative stress at the bone-implant interface plays an important role in the impaired osteointegration under diabetic conditions. While the underlying mechanisms remain unknown and the targeted treatments are urgently needed. Ophiopogonin D (OP-D), isolated from Chinese herbal Radix Ophiopogon japonicas, is generally reported to be a potent antioxidant agent. In the present study, we hypothesized that OP-D exerted promotive effects on osteointegration against oxidative stress, and investigated the underlying mechanisms associated with alteration of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Rabbit osteoblasts incubated on titanium alloy implant were co-cultured with normal serum (NS), diabetic serum (DS), DS + OP-D, DS + NAC (a potent ROS inhibitor) and DS + OP-D + Dkk1 (a Wnt inhibitor) for examinations of osteoblast behaviors. For in vivo study, titanium alloy implants were implanted into the femoral condyle defects on diabetic rabbits. Results demonstrated that diabetes-induced oxidative stress resulted in osteoblast dysfunctions and apoptotic injury at the bone-implant interface, concomitant with the inactivation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Importantly, OP-D administration attenuated oxidative stress, directly reactivating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Osteoblast dysfunctions were thus reversed as evidenced by improved osteoblast adhesion, proliferation and differentiation, and ameliorated apoptotic injury, exerting similar effects to NAC treatment. In addition, the positive effects afforded by OP-D were confirmed by improved osteointegration and oetogenesis within the titanium alloy implants in vivo by Micro-CT and histological analyses. Furthermore, the pro-osteogenic effects of OP-D were almost completely abolished by the Wnt inhibitor Dkk1. These results demonstrated, for the first time, OP-D administration alleviated the damaged osteointegration of titanium alloy implants under diabetic conditions by means of inhibiting oxidative stress via a Wnt/beta-catenin-dependent mechanism. The OP-D administration would become a reliable treatment strategy for implant failure therapy in diabetics due to the optimal anti-oxidative and pro-osteogenic properties.

AB The class I aldolase dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) catalyzes the first committed step of the diaminopimelate (DAP) lysine biosynthesis pathway in bacteria, archaea and plants. Despite the existence, in databases, of numerous fungal sequences annotated as DHDPS, its presence in fungi has been the subject of contradictory claims. We report the characterization of DHDPS candidates from fungi. Firstly, the putative DHDPS from Coccidioides immitis (PDB ID: 3QFE) was shown to have negligible enzyme activity. Sequence analysis of 3QFE showed that three out of the seven amino acid residues critical for DHDPS activity are absent; however, exact matches to catalytic residues from two other class I aldolases, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate aldolase (KDGA), and 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase (HOGA), were identified. The presence of both KDGA and HOGA activity in 3QFE was confirmed in vitro using enzyme assays, the first report of such dual activity. Subsequent analyses of all publically available fungal sequences revealed that no entry contains all seven residues important for DHDPS function. The candidate with the highest number of identities (6 of 7), KIW77228 from Fonsecaea pedrosoi, was shown to have trace DHDPS activity in vitro, partially restored by substitution of the seventh critical residue, and to be incapable of complementing DHDPS-deficient E. coli cells. Combined with the presence of all seven sequences for the alternative alpha-aminoadipate (AAA) lysine biosynthesis pathway in C. immitis and F. pedrosoi, we believe that DHDPS and the DAP pathway are absent in fungi, and further, that robust informed methods for annotating genes need to be implemented.

AB Orexin A (OXA), a hypothalamic neuropeptide, regulates food intake, sleep-wake cycle and energy balance by binding to its receptor (OX1R). Apart from brain, OXA and OX1R are also present in peripheral organs including reproductive tissues. Mammalian reproduction depends on uptake and proper utilization of glucose in the testes. This study, therefore, examined role of OXA/OX1R system in regulation of glucose homeostasis in adult mouse testis under in vivo and ex vivo conditions. Binding of OXA to OX1R was blocked using an OX1R antagonist, SB-334867. Mice were given a single bilateral intratesticular injection of the antagonist at doses of 4 and 12 mu g/mouse and sacrificed 24 h post-injection. In order to understand the direct role of OXA in testes of adult mice, an ex vivo experiment was performed where binding of OXA to OX1R in the testis was blocked by using the same OX1R antagonist. The antagonist treatment affected testicular glucose and lactate concentration with concomitant down-regulation in the expression of glucose transporters 3 and 8. A decreased activity in lactate dehydrogenase enzyme and imbalance between germ cell survival and proliferation were also noted in testes in treated mice. The results of ex vivo study supported the results obtained from in vivo study. The findings thus suggest involvement of OXA/OX1R system in regulation of testicular glucose homeostasis and germ cell kinetics in adult mice.

AB Obesity, triggered by high-fat diet (HFD), is associated to altered gustatory perception of dietary lipids. Oleanolic acid (OLA), a triterpene, has been reported to exert anti-obesity effects in animal models. Hence, we investigated the role of OLA in the modulation of oro-sensory perception of lipids in control and HFD-induced obese mice. As expected, OLA-treated obese mice exhibited a decrease in body, liver, and visceral adipose tissue weights. OLA treatment improved glucose tolerance, insulin level, plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. OLA-treated obese mice exhibited higher fat preference compared to untreated obese mice, probably due to the increase in mRNA encoding CD36, a fat taste receptor, in mouse taste bud cells (mTBC). This phenomenon was associated with fatty-acid induced increases in free intracellular calcium concentrations, [Ca2+]i, induced in mTBC from OLA-treated obese mice. OLA also influenced the expression of mRNA encoding proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta and IL-6) and some lipogenic genes (PPAR alpha, SREBP1, FAS, ChREBP, and G6Pase) in liver and adipose tissue. These findings reveal that OLA improves gustatory perception of lipids and exerts protective effects in obesity.

AB Over the past two decades biologists and bioinformaticians have unearthed substantial evidence supporting a role for G-quadruplexes as important mediators of biological processes. This includes telomere damage signaling, transcriptional activity, and splicing. Both their structural heterogeneity and their abundance in oncogene promoters makes them ideal targets for drug discovery. Currently, there are hundreds of deposited DNA and RNA quadruplex atomic structures which have allowed researchers to begin using in silico drug screening approaches to develop novel stabilizing ligands. Here we provide a review of the past decade of G-quadruplex virtual drug discovery approaches and campaigns. With this we introduce relevant virtual screening platforms followed by a discussion of best practices to assist future G4 VS campaigns.

AB Recent antidiabetic drugs including GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-IV inhibitors have demonstrated protective effects in several cardiovascular diseases but their effect in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is far less known. AAA can be associated with extremely high rates of mortality and pharmacological treatments are still lacking underlining the real need to identify new therapeutic targets. The aim of this review was to summarize current knowledge on the role of GLP-1 pathway in AAA. A systematic literature review was performed and 6 relevant studies (2 clinical and 4 experimental) were included. Experimental studies demonstrated a protective effect of both GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-IV inhibitors through targeting the main pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AAA formation. The effects of these drugs in human AAA are still poorly known. In the limelight of clinical and experimental studies, we discuss current limits and future directions.

AB Identifying precise and predictive biomarkers of health and disease is a critical objective of clinical biochemistry and biomedical research. New concepts and technologies have emerged recently that could support such an objective. The exposome corresponds to the totality of exposure over the lifetime. Research in this field allowed the development of sensors and biological biomarkers using omics technologies that are relevant for predicting the effect of those exposure on human health. Precision medicine has primarily focused on adapting treatments to the genetic profiles of tumors, when in fact, it had originally a wider scope including the use of robust biomarkers for disease prevention. Large-scale genetic studies have also contributed to highlight gene environment interactions, and were extended more recently to epigenetics. In line with the systems medicine approach, we propose to integrate the genome and exposome data in what we present as the exposome-genome paradigm. Such an integrated view will help strengthen approaches to identify relevant predictive markers that can support precise prevention actions both at the population and at the individual levels.

AB Plasmodium proteases play both regulatory and effector roles in essential biological processes in this important pathogen and have long been investigated as drug targets. Plasmepsin V from P. falciparum (PfPMV) is an essential protease that processes proteins for export into the host erythrocyte and is a focus of ongoing drug development efforts. In the present study, recombinant protein production, inhibition assays, binding studies as well as molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies were used to investigate the mode of binding of a PEXEL-based peptidomimetic and naphthoquinone compounds to PfPMV. Consistent with our previous study, refolded PfPMVs were produced with functional characteristics similar to the soluble counterpart. Naphthoquinone compounds inhibited PfPMV activity by 50% at 50 mu M but did not affect pepsin activity. The IC50 values of compounds 31 and 37 against PfPMV were 22.25 and 68.94 mu M, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that PEXEL peptide interacted with PfPMV active site residues via electrostatic interactions while naphthoquinone binding preferred van der Waal interactions. P-1'-Ser of the PfEMP2 substrate formed an additional H-bond with Asp365 promoting the catalytic efficiency. Additionally, the effect of metal ions on the secondary structure of PfPMV was examined. Our results confirmed that Hg2+ ions reversibly induced the changes in secondary structure of the protein whereas Fe3+ ions induced irreversibly. No change was observed in the presence of Ca2+ ions. Overall, the results here suggested that naphthoquinone derivatives may represent another source of antimalarial inhibitors targeting aspartic proteases but further chemical modifications are required.

AB Recently we have found that cytokine IL-2 and innate immunity protein Tag7 activate cytotoxic lymphocytes that kill HLA-negative tumor cells, inducing both apoptosis and necroptosis. Here we decrypt the processes, taking part in necroptosis execution after FasL-Fas interaction. Necroptosis begins with RIPK1 activation and necrosome formation. Subsequent activation of MLKL results in the increase of Ca2+ level in the cell and activation of Ca2+-dependent enzymes causing lysosomal membrane permeabilization and the release of cathepsins to the cytosol. STAT3 translocation to the mitochondria and binding to a component of the respiratory chain complex I causes ROS accumulation. We have shown that transduction of necroptotic signal via TNFR1 and Fas has many common points. It is known that apoptosis plays a major role in physiological cell death; however, under pathological conditions necroptosis is very common. That is why the detailed mechanisms of FasL-Fas necroptosis can help in understanding the processes of elimination of tumor cells that have blocked apoptosis signal transduction.

AB A variety of missense mutations in proto-oncogene protein tyrosine kinase c-Met have been clinically observed in the patients and families of papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC), imparting that the kinase mutations can be exploited as a new and potential therapeutic target for pRCC. Here, a systematic inhibitor response-to-kinase mutation profile for ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) against pRCC-related c-Met mutations is created using a rigorous thermodynamic cycle scheme, from which we are able to identify a number of representative inhibitor/mutation pairs with passivation and sensitization. It is revealed that passivation is commonly caused by steric hindrance between the mutated residue and inhibitor ligand, while sensitization usually results from the formation of favorable nonbonded interactions upon the mutation. The type II inhibitor Nintedanib possesses a high selectivity (7.2-fold) for c-Met(Y1248H) variant over wild type. Structural and energetic analysis revealed that the Y1248H mutation is located in kinase's activation loop which can directly contact the extended moiety of type II inhibitor. The titratable variant residue His1248 is protonated with stabilization by its vicinal negatively charged residue Asp1246, which can form a geometrically satisfactory hydrogen bond and a weak cation-pi interaction with the inhibitor ligand, thus conferring variant selectivity to the Nintedanib/Y1248H sensitization.

AB Spectroscopic and calorimetric methods were employed to assess the stability and the folding aspect of a novel recombinant alkaline-stable lipase KV1 from Acinetobacter haemolyticus under varying pH and temperature. Data on far ultraviolet-circular dichroism of recombinant lipase KV1 under two alkaline conditions (pH 8.0 and 12.0) at 40 degrees C reveal strong negative ellipticities at 208, 217, 222 nm, implying its secondary structure belonging to a alpha + beta class with 47.3 and 39.0% ellipticity, respectively. Results demonstrate that lipase KV1 adopts its most stable conformation at pH 8.0 and 40 degrees C. Conversely, the protein assumes a random coil structure at pH 4.0 and 80 degrees C, evident from a strong negative peak at - 200 nm. This blue shift suggests a general decline in enzyme activity in conjunction with the partially or fully unfolded state that invariably exposed more hydrophobic surfaces of the lipase protein. The maximum emission at similar to 335 nm for pH 8.0 and 40 degrees C indicates the adoption of a favorable protein conformation with a high number of buried tryptophan residues, reducing solvent exposure. Appearance of an intense Amide I absorption band at pH 8.0 corroborates an intact secondary structure. A lower enthalpy value for pH 4.0 over pH 8.0 and 12.0 in the differential scanning calorimetric data corroborates the stability of the lipase at alkaline conditions, while a low K-m (0.68 +/- 0.03 mM) for tributyrin verifies the high affinity of lipase KV1 for the substrate. The data, herein offer useful insights into future structure-based tunable catalytic activity of lipase KV1. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB Human de novo iron-sulfur (Fe-S) assembly complex consists of cysteine desulfurase NFS1, accessory protein ISD11, acyl carrier protein ACP, scaffold protein ISCU, and allosteric activator frataxin (FXN). FXN binds the NFS1-ISD11-ACP-ISCU complex (SDAU), to activate the desulfurase activity and Fe-S cluster biosynthesis. In the absence of FXN, the NFS1-ISD11-ACP (SDA) complex was reportedly inhibited by binding of recombinant ISCU. Recent studies also reported a substitution at position Met141 on the yeast ISCU orthologue Isu, to Ile, Leu, Val, or Cys, could bypass the requirement of FXN for Fe-S cluster biosynthesis and cell viability. Here, we show that recombinant human ISCU binds zinc(II) ion, as previously demonstrated with the E. coli orthologue ISCU. Surprisingly, the relative proportion between zinc-bound and zinc-depleted forms varies among purification batches. Importantly the presence of zinc in ISCU impacts SDAU desulfurase activity. Indeed, removal of zinc(II) ion from ISCU causes a moderate but significant increase in activity compared to SDA alone, and FXN can activate both zinc-depleted and zincbound forms of ISCU complexed to SDA. Taking into consideration the inhibition of desulfurase activity by zinc-bound ISCU, we characterized wild type ISCU and the M140I, M140L, and M140V variants under both zinc-bound and zinc-depleted conditions, and did not observe significant differences in the biochemical and biophysical properties between wild-type and variants. Importantly, in the absence of FXN, ISCU variants behaved like wild-type and did not stimulate the desulfurase activity of the SDA complex. This study therefore identifies an important regulatory role for zinc-bound ISCU in modulation of the human Fe-S assembly system in vitro and reports no 'FXN bypass' effect on mutations at position Met140 in human ISCU. Furthermore, this study also calls for caution in interpreting studies involving recombinant ISCU by taking into consideration the influence of the bound zinc(II) ion on SDAU complex activity.

AB Lung cancer is one of the main causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Despite advances in lung cancer pathophysiology, diagnosis and prognosis, a better understanding of the disease is strongly needed in order to establish novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches that should improve treatment outcomes. Exosomes are a type of cell-secreted extracellular vesicles, which transfer a wide variety of biomolecules, such as proteins, mRNAs, microRNAs, and lipids, are implicated in intercellular communication and modulate tumor-host interactions. The potential value of exosomes and their contents in lung cancer diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of treatment outcome is supported by ample literature. Growing attention has been drawn specifically to the critical role of exosomal miRNAs in lung cancer pathogenesis and their potential clinical utility, especially due to their ability to modulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. Owing to their universal presence in the blood and other bodily fluids, exosomes are considered candidate biomarkers. Furthermore, their ability to deliver biomolecules and drugs to recipient cells renders them possible drug delivery vehicles in lung cancer. Here we review the pathological functions of exosomes in cancer and discuss their possible clinical utility as biomarkers and therapeutic agents in the management of lung cancer.

AB Quercetin, a common dietary flavone, is a competitive inhibitor of glucose uptake and is also thought to be transported into cells by GLUT1. In this study, we confirm that quercetin is a competitive inhibitor of GLUT1 and also demonstrate that newly synthesized compounds, WZB-117 and BAY-876 are robust inhibitors of GLUT1 in L929 cells. To measure quercetin interaction with L929 cells, we develop a new fluorescent assay using flow cytometry. The binding of quercetin and its inhibitory effects on 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) uptake showed nearly identical dose dependent effects, with both having maximum effects between 50 and 100 mu M and similar half maximum effects at 8.9 and 8.5 mu M respectively. The interaction of quercetin was rapid with t(1/2) of 54 s and the onset and loss of its inhibitory effects on 2DG uptake were equally fast. This suggests that either quercetin is simply binding to surface GLUT1 or its transport in and out of the cell reaches equilibrium very quickly. If quercetin is transported, the co-incubation of quercetin with other glucose inhibitors should block quercetin uptake. However, we observed that WZB-117, an exofacial binding inhibitor of GLUT1 reduced quercetin interaction, while cytochalasin B, an endofacial binding inhibitor, enhanced quercetin interaction, and BAY-876 had no effect on quercetin interaction. Taken together, these data are more consistent with quercetin simply binding to GLUT1, but not actually being transported into L929 cells via the glucose channel in GLUT1.

AB To treat obesity, suppression of white adipose tissue (WAT) expansion and activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) are considered as potential therapeutic targets. Recent advances have been made in the induction of brown fat-like adipocytes (beige) in WAT, which represents an attractive potential strategy for the management and treatment of obesity. Use of natural compounds for browning of white adipocytes can be considered as a safe and novel strategy against obesity. Here, we report that transanethole (TA), a flavoring substance present in the essential oils of various plants, alleviated high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in mice models via elevation of the expression of beige-specific genes such as Ppargc1 alpha, Prdm16, Ucp1, Cd137, Cited1, Tbx1, and Tmem26. TA also regulated lipid metabolism in white adipocytes via reduction of adipogenesis and lipogenesis as well as elevation of lipolysis and fat oxidation. Moreover, TA exhibited thermogenic activity by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis in white adipocytes and activating brown adipocytes. In addition, molecular docking analysis enabled us to successfully predict core proteins for fat browning such as beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) and sirtuin1 (SIRT1) based on their low binding energy interactions with TA for promotion of regulatory mechanisms. Indeed, agonistic and antagonistic studies demonstrated that TA induced browning of 3T3-L1 adipocytes through activation of beta-AR as well as the AMPK-mediated SIRT1 pathway regulating PPAR alpha and PGC-1 alpha. In conclusion, TA possesses potential therapeutic implications for treatment of obesity by playing multiple modulatory roles in the induction of white fat browning, activation of brown adipocytes, and promotion of lipid catabolism.

AB Cutaneous melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, responds poorly to conventional therapy. The appearance of Tn antigen-modified proteins in cancer is correlated with metastasis and poor prognoses. The Tn determinant has been recognized as a powerful diagnostic and therapeutic target, and as an object for the development of anti-tumor vaccine strategies. This study was designed to identify Tn-carrying proteins and reveal their influence on cutaneous melanoma progression. We used a lectin-based strategy to purify Tn antigen-enriched cellular glycoproteome, the LC-MS/MS method to identify isolated glycoproteins, and the DAVID bioinformatics tool to classify the identified proteins. We identified 146 different Tn-bearing glycoproteins, 88% of which are new. The Tn-glycoproteome was generally enriched in proteins involved in the control of ribosome biogenesis, CDR-mediated mRNA stabilization, cell-cell adhesion and extracellular vesicle formation. The differential expression patterns of Tn-modified proteins for cutaneous primary and metastatic melanoma cells supported nonmetastatic and metastatic cell phenotypes, respectively. To our knowledge, this study is the first large-scale proteomic analysis of Tn-bearing proteins in human melanoma cells. The identified Tn-modified proteins are related to the biological and molecular nature of cutaneous melanoma and may be valuable biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

AB Evaluating the model quality of protein structures that evolve in environments with particular physicochemical properties requires scoring functions that are adapted to their specific residue compositions and/or structural characteristics. Thus, computational methods developed for structures from the cytosol cannot work properly on membrane or secreted proteins. Here, we present MyPMFs, an easy-to-use tool that allows users to train statistical potentials of mean force (PMFs) on the protein structures of their choice, with all parameters being adjustable. We demonstrate its use by creating an accurate statistical potential for transmembrane protein domains. We also show its usefulness to study the influence of the physical environment on residue interactions within protein structures.

AB S-Alk(en)yl-L-cysteine sulfoxides, initially found in plants of the genus Allium, are converted to antimicrobial thiosulfinates by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate(PLP)-dependent alliinase (EC 4.4.1.4). It was found that methionine g-lyase (MGL, EC 4.4.1.11) catalyzes the beta-elimination reaction of (+/-)-S-alk(en)yl-L-cysteine sulfoxides to yield thiosulfinates. The efficient catalyst for the production of thiosulfinates, C115H mutant MGL, developed in our previous work, cleaves S-alk(en)yl-L-cysteine sulfoxides more effectively than the wild type enzyme. Thiosulfinates generated by the C115H MGL/sulfoxide system have demonstrated growth inhibition of Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and clinical isolates of pathogenic bacteria from mice. In search of a more effective system for production of antibacterial thiosulfinates we synthesized S-substituted analogues of L-cysteine sulfoxide with a longer side chains - (+/-)-S-propyl-Lcysteine sulfoxide ((+/-)-propiin) and (+/-)-S-n-butyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide ((+/-)-butiin) and determined catalytic parameters of the b-elimination reaction of two sulfoxides. It was found that C115H MGL cleaves (+/-)-propiin with the highest rate, as compared to other (+/-)-S-alk(en)yl-L-cysteine sulfoxides. Studies on interaction of the enzyme with (thorn)- or (-)-S-alk(en)yl-L-cysteine sulfoxides revealed that C115H MGL can decompose both diastereomers equally. The antibacterial activity of the mixture of the mutant MGL with (+/-)-propiin is comparable with those of the mixtures with S-allyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide (alliin) and S-methyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide (methiin). The results make MGL/sulfoxide system more advantageous in preparing antibacterial thiosulfinates as compared to alliinase-based system, which preferably cleaves naturally occurring (thorn)-sulfoxides.

TI Diacylglycerol kinase delta controls down-regulation of cyclin D1 for

AB Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) is a lipid-metabolizing enzyme that phosphorylates diacylglycerol (DG) to produce phosphatidic acid (PA). DGK delta is highly expressed in the skeletal muscle, and a decrease in DGK delta expression increases the severity of type 2 diabetes. However, the role of DGK delta in myogenic differentiation is still unknown. The present study demonstrated that DGK delta expression was down-regulated in the early stage of C2C12 myogenic differentiation almost concurrently with a decrease in cyclin D1 expression. The knockdown of DGK delta by DGK delta-specific siRNAs significantly increased the levels of cyclin D1 expression at 48 h after C2C12 myogenic differentiation. In contrast, at the same time, the knockdown of DGK delta decreased the levels of myogenin expression and the number of myosin heavy chain (MHC)-positive cells. These results indicate that DGK delta regulates the early differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts via controlling the down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression. Moreover, the suppression of DGK delta expression increased the phosphorylation levels of conventional and novel protein kinase Cs (cnPKCs). Furthermore, DGK delta suppression increased the levels of cyclin D1 and phospho-cnPKCs even at the first 24 h of myogenic differentiation. These results suggest that DGK delta controls the down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression by attenuating the PKC signaling pathway for C2C12 myogenic differentiation.

AB Strategies for targeting CD47 are becoming a hot spot of cancer immunotherapy. However the ubiquitous expression of CD47, especially on the RBC, makes the targeted therapy facing safety risk issues. So, how to balance the safety and efficacy during CD47 inhibition is currently a major question. We had reported an anti-CD47 antibody ZF1 with potent anti-tumor effect. In this study, we further developed and assessed a novel fully human anti-CD47 antibody, AMMS4-G4, derived from ZF1 using affinity maturation. AMMS4G4 exhibited equivalent anticancer effects with Hu5F9-G4, a humanized anti-CD47 antibody in clinical trial, on the potential of inducing significant phagocytosis of tumor cells in vitro and prolonging the survival of leukemia xenografted mice. Additionally, AMMS4-G4 significantly inhibited the growth of grafted solid tumors by enhancing macrophage infiltration and modestly enhanced the anti-tumor activity of opsonizing antibody and antiangiogenic therapy. In cynomolgus monkeys, AMMS4-G4 was safely administered, was well tolerated at doses of 30 and 60 mg/kg, and did not produce serious adverse events, except for the reversible anemia, which was observed after 3 days and started to recover from 9 days later. Remarkably, it was proved by in vitro assay that Hu5F9-G4 induced RBC hemagglutination which wasn't observed in AMMS4-G4. On the whole, AMMS4-G4 was demonstrated to be a promising candidate with great potential and safe profile for cancer immunotherapy.

AB Early prediction of tumor relapse depends on the identification of new prognostic cancer biomarkers, which are suitable for monitoring tumor response to different chemotherapeutic drugs. Using RNA-Seq, RT-qPCR, bioinformatics, and studies utilizing the murine tumor xenograft model, we have found significant and consistent changes in the abundance of five lincRNAs (LINC00973, LINC00941, CASC19, CCAT1, and BCAR4) upon treatment of both HT-29 and HCT-116 cells with 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan at different doses and durations; both in vitro and in vivo. The most frequent changes were detected for LINC00973, whose content is most strongly and consistently increased upon treatment of both colon cancer cell lines with all three chemotherapeutic drugs. Additional studies are required in order to determine the molecular mechanisms by which anticancer drugs affect LINC00973 expression and to define the consequences of its upregulation on drug resistance of cancer cells.

AB Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an enzyme responsible of prostaglandins production, such as prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)), an immune response modulator that regulates the immune system to inhibit Th1 and to promote Th2 cytokines production. Many parasites modulate their host immune response through PGE(2) effects; however, in parasites, only one protein with COX activity has been described, the alpha-actinin of Entamoeba histolytica. Prostanoids production has been reported in some species of Leishmania but not the enzymes responsible of their production. To identify the protein responsible for COX activity in Leishmania mexicana, we examined total extracts of promastigotes and samples with COX activity were subjected to ion exchange column purification and precipitation with ammonium sulphate; fractions with activity were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using an anti-mouse COX-2 polyclonal antibody. Results showed that in those samples with enzymatic activity, the anti-mouse COX-2 polyclonal antibody recognized a protein with an approximate molecular weight of 66 KDa. Bands recognized by the antibody were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis and the results showed that several peptides from the bands purified by two different methods, and that were recognized by the anti-mouse COX-2 polyclonal antibody corresponded to the Leishmania mexicana gp63 surface protease. L. mexicana gp63 was purified by a Concanavalin A (Con-A) affinity column and subjected to immunoprecipitation with a commercial anti-Leishmania gp63 polyclonal antibody; the immunoprecipitated sample was analyzed for COX activity showing that the anti-gp63 antibody did immunoprecipitate the COX activity. The presence of COX activity was further confirmed in amastigotes extracts of L. mexicana. Moreover, a recombinant gp63 protein was produced and its COX activity tested, confirming that gp63 is the molecule responsible for COX activity.

AB Cysteine cathepsins (CTS), being involved in both physiological and pathological processes, play an important role in the human body. During the last 30 years, it has been shown that CTS are highly upregulated in a wide variety of cancer types although they have received a little attention as a potential therapeutic target as compared to serine or metalloproteinases. Studies on the increasing problem of neoplastic progression have revealed that secretion of cell-surface-and intracellular cysteine proteases is aberrant in tumor cells and has an impact on their growth, invasion, and metastasis by taking part in tumor angiogenesis, in apoptosis, and in events of inflammatory and immune responses. Considering the role of CTS in carcinogenesis, inhibition of these enzymes becomes an attractive strategy for cancer therapy. The downregulation of natural CTS inhibitors (CTSsis), such as cystatins, observed in various types of cancer, supports this claim. The intention of this review is to highlight the relationship of CTS with cancer and to present illustrations that explain how some of their inhibitors affect processes related to neoplastic progression.

AB rNTPs are structurally similar to dNTPs but are largely molar excessive in cell than dNTPs. rNTPs are inevitably incorporated into DNA to form rNMPs. Long RNA primers can also be incorporated into lagging-strand DNA. However, the influence of these incorporated rNMPs on T7 DNA replication remains unknown. In this work, we investigated primer extension past consecutive rNMPs (rA, r(AC), r(ACC), or r(ACCA)) on template by T7 DNA polymerase or by its complex with helicase. Primer extension is gradually inhibited with increasing rNMP number. rNMPs decrease the dNTP incorporation efficiency, slightly weaken the binding affinity of polymerase to DNA in ternary complex, and reduce the protein interaction between polymerase and helicase at DNA fork, thereby decreasing the fraction of the productive enzyme center dot DNA complex and the average primer extension rate. Therefore, the consecutive rNMPs on template gradually inhibit T7 primer extension and strand-displacement DNA synthesis, providing the kinetic information for the inhibition of rNMPs on DNA replication.

AB The transformation of macrophages into lipid-loaded foam cells is a critical and early event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Several recent reports highlighted that induction of TLR4 signaling promotes macrophage foam cell formation; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been clearly elucidated. Here, we found that the TLR4 mediated inflammatory signaling communicated with mTORC2-Akt-mTORC1 metabolic cascade in macrophage and thereby promoting lipid uptake and foam cell formation. Mechanistically, LPS treatment markedly upregulates TLR4 mediated inflammatory pathway which by activating mTORC2 induces Akt phosphorylation at serine 473 and that aggravate mTORC1 dependent scavenger receptors expression and consequent lipid accumulation in THP-1 macrophages. Inhibition of mTORC2 either by silencing Rictor expression or inhibiting its association with mTOR notably prevents LPS induced Akt activation, scavenger receptors expression, and macrophage lipid accumulation. Although suppression of mTORC1 expression by genetic knockdown of Raptor did not produce any significant change in Akt S473 phosphorylation, however, incubation with Akt activator in Rictor silenced cells failed to promote scavenger receptors expression and macrophage foam cell formation. Thus, present research explored the signaling pathway involved in inflammation-induced macrophage foam cells formation and therefore, targeting this pathway might be useful for preventing macrophage foam cell formation.

AB Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disease and is considered incurable. Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is closely related to the proliferation and adhesion of MM. Using protein-SELEX, we performed a screen for aptamers that bind GST-ANXA2 from a library, and GST protein was used for negative selection. The enrichment of the ssDNA pool was monitored by filter-binding assay during selection. After nine rounds of screening and high-throughput sequencing, we obtained six candidate aptamers that bind to the ANXA2 protein. The affinities of the candidate aptamers for ANXA2 were determined by ELONA. Binding of aptamer wh6 to the ANXA2 protein and to the MM cell was verified by aptamer pulldown experiment and flow cytometry, respectively. Aptamer wh6 binds the ANXA2 protein with good stability and has a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range. The binding specificity of aptamer wh6 was confirmed in vivo in nude mouse xenografts with MM cells and with MM bone marrow aspirates. Furthermore, aptamer wh6 can block MM cell adhesion to ANXA2 and block the proliferation of MM cells induced by ANXA2. In summary, wh6 can be considered a promising candidate tool for MM diagnosis and treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB The "Bioenergetique et Ingenierie des Proteines (BIP)" laboratory, CNRS (France), organized its first French workshop on molecular chaperone proteins and protein folding in November 2017. The goal of this workshop was to gather scientists working in France on chaperone proteins and protein folding. This initiative was a great success with excellent talks and fruitful discussions. The highlights were on the description of unexpected functions and post-translational regulation of known molecular chaperones (such as Hsp90, Hsp33, SecB, GroEL) and on state-of-the-art methods to tackle questions related to this theme, including Cryo-electron microscopy, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR), simulation and modeling. We expect to organize a second workshop in two years that will include more scientists working in France in the chaperone field.

AB We have previously constructed a novel polypeptide, PsTag, that should be useful in the development of biologics with properties comparable to those achievable by PEGylation, but with potentially less side effects. However, the low fermentation yields of polypeptide fusion proteins may limit the application of this technology. We suspected that when polypeptide fusion protein was expressed in E. coli, the corresponding 8 tRNAs were needed to transport a large number of repetitive 5 amino acids to the ribosomes and thus, resulting in a relative deficiency of these tRNAs. PsTag600-FGF21, a long-acting FGF21 fusion protein, was used as a model for studying the effects of these non-rare tRNAs on the efficiency of heterologous protein production in E. coli. To further enhance the expression level and facilitate purification, secretory expressions of PsTag600-FGF21 were achieved by fusion with three signal peptides. Meanwhile, a comparison of several distinctive characterizations was carried out between PsTag600-FGF21 and PEG20K-FGF21. We investigated the protective effects of PsTag600-FGF21 in a nonalcoholic steatohepatitis model induced by methionine-and choline-deficient diet. Our results showed that the provision of 8 tRNAs and secretory expression remarkably increased the expression levels of PsTag fusion protein, meanwhile there were no significant effects on E. coli growth states. PsTag600-FGF21 had a larger hydrodynamic volume, a higher affinity and a longer plasma half-life than PEG20K-FGF21, while avoiding vacuole formation in mice. In NASH mice, administration of PsTag600-FGF21 reduced hepatic steatosis, fibrosis and inflammation. Therefore, PsTag600-FGF21 with higher expression level may be further developed for potentially application in clinics.

AB We have previously shown that the cafeteria diet increases body fat mass, plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) and insulin levels, glucose uptake by white and brown adipose tissues, as well as the sympathetic activity to both adipose tissues in Wistar rats. The metabolic pathways responsible for the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were examined in cafeteria diet-fed rats. After 3 weeks offering cafeteria diet, we evaluated: (i) activity of the sympathetic nervous system by norepinephrine turnover rates; (ii) de novo fatty acid synthesis in vivo using (H2O)-H-3; (iii) secretion of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TAG secretion measuring serum TAG levels after administration of lipase lipoprotein inhibitor, (iv) liver cytosolic lipases activities and (v) liver mRNA expression of enzymes involved in lipids secretion and oxidation by RT-PCR. The cafeteria diet induced an increase in TAG (120%) and cholesterol (30%) liver contents. Cafeteria diet did not change the sympathetic nervous system activity to liver, but induced a marked increase in the lipogenesis (approximately four-fold) and significant increase in cytosolic lipases activities (46%) and VLDL-TAG secretion (22%) compared to control diet-fed rats. The cafeteria diet also increased the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (30%) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (130%) mRNA expression but decreased the apolipoprotein B100 (26%) mRNA expression. Our findings demonstrate that the increase in the cytosolic lipases activities and VLDL-TAG secretion rates were not able to compensate for the increased lipogenesis rates induced by the cafeteria diet, resulting in NAFLD.

AB Human adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (hASCs) have tremendous therapeutic potential and the ability to offer insight into human development and disease. Here we subject human ASCs to siRNA-mediated knockdown of Notch3 cultured under both self-renewing and adipogenic differentiation conditions. Self-renewal was monitored by assessing viability and proliferation rates through staining and alamar-Blue assays, respectively. Adipogenesis was measured through Oil-Red O staining, western blot, and quantitative real-time RT-PCR that determined expression levels of multipotency and adipogenic markers over time. Notch3 was expressed in self-renewing hASCs but knockdown, as validated by qRT-PCR and western blot, showed no impact on cell viability, as measured through live-dead staining, or cell proliferation rates, as measured through alamarBlue assays. However, although Notch3 expression was observed to increase during adipogenesis, in the absence of Notch3 there was a significant increase in hASC adipogenesis as demonstrated through an increased number of lipid vesicles, and increased expression of adipogenic markers ppar-gamma, adiponectin, fabp4, and plin2. Although Notch3 is only one of four Notch receptors expressed on the surface of hASCs, this receptor appears important for proper regulation of adipogenic differentiation, possibly serving as a negative regulator to prevent inappropriate adipogenesis or promote other lineage commitments of ASCs.

AB The key role of oxidative stress in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) has been established by the large body of evidence from previous studies. Excessive consumption of ethanol induces the production of a variety of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the liver, such as superoxide, H2O2, and hydroxyl radical. These products activate oxidant-sensitive signaling cascades and modulators of apoptosis. Because ROS accumulation is closely related to ALD, a number of studies have investigated the benefits of antioxidants. Recent studies demonstrated that polyphenol chlorogenic acid (CGA) has antioxidant properties and health benefits, such as reduction of relative risk of cardiovascular diseases and hepatoprotective effects against acetaminophen toxicity. However, the protective effects of CGA against ALD have not been studied in detail. We hypothesize that CGA plays a role in preventing ALD through its antioxidant properties. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of CGA against liver injuries in vivo. Reduced alcohol-inducedsteatosis, apoptotic cell death, and fibrosis due to reduced levels of oxidative stress were observed. These findings suggest that CGA treatment can be an effective approach to attenuate ALD through the suppression of oxidative stress.

AB p-Cresyl glucuronide (p-CG) is a by-product of tyrosine metabolism that accumulates in patients with end-stage renal disease. p-CG binding to human serum albumin in physiological conditions (37 degrees C, pH 7.40) was studied by ultrafiltration (MWCO 10 kDa) and data were analyzed assuming one binding site. The estimated value of the association constant was 2.77 x 10(3)M(-1) and a maximal stoichiometry of 3.80 mol per mole. At a concentration relevant for end-stage renal patients, p-CG was 23% bound to albumin. Competition experiments, using fluorescent probes, demonstrated that p-CG did not bind to Sudlow's site I or site II. The p-CG did not interfere with the binding of p-cresyl-sulfate or indoxyl sulfate to serum albumin. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB The present study highlights the cellular mechanism of resistance in human adenocarcinoma (Colo-205) cells against apoptosis induction by Rusvinoxidase, an L-amino acid oxidase purified from Russell's Viper venom (RVV). The significantly lower cytotoxicity as well as apoptotic activity of Rusvinoxidase towards Colo-205 cells (compared to MCF-7 breast cancer cells) is correlated with lower depletion of cellular glutathione content and increased down-regulation of catalase activity of Colo-205 cells following Rusvinoxidase treatment. Exposure to Rusvinoxidase subsequently diminished reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and failed to impair mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in apoptosis induction resistance in Colo-205 cells. Further, higher expression levels of caspase 8, compared to caspase 9, indicate that Rusvinoxidase preferentially triggers the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis in Colo- 205 cells. A time-dependent lower ratio of the relative expression of Bax and Bcl-xL (pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins) in Colo-205 cells, compared to our previous study on MCF-7 cells, unambiguously supports a higher cellular resistance mechanism in Colo-205 cells against Rusvinoxidase-induced apoptosis.

The mRNA and protein expression was detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Levels of cytokines secreted in culture medium were measured using the specific ELISA kits. The miR-98 mimic/inhibitor was transfected to explore the role of miR-98 in HCC-conditioned tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). HepG2 cells were then cultured with condition medium from HCC-conditioned TAMs pretreated with miR-98 mimic/inhibitor, and cell migration and invasion assays were performed. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to analyze the interaction between miR-98 and interleukin (IL)-10. Our results showed that miR-98 was downregulated and IL-10 was upregulated in HCC tissues and HCC-conditioned TAMs. Further studies identified that IL-10 was a direct target gene of miR-98 in HCC-conditioned TAMs. Moreover, miR-98 regulated the levels of inflammatory cytokines in HCC-conditioned TAMs. HCC-conditioned TAMs pretreated with miR-98 regulated migration and invasion of HepG2 cells in vitro, and the effects were significantly reversed by IL-10. In conclusion, miR-98 not only regulated expression of inflammatory cytokines in HCC-conditioned TAMs, but also modulated the capacity of HCCconditioned TAMs to regulate HepG2 cell migration and invasion, at least in part, by targeting IL-10. As a result, miR-98 may suppress the progress of HCC. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM). All rights reserved.

AB Multi-domain inhibitors capable to block the activity of different classes of proteases are not very common in nature. However, these kinds of molecules are attractive systems for biomedical or biotechnological applications, where two or more different targets need to be neutralized. SmCI, the Sabellastarte magnifica Carboxypeptidase Inhibitor, is a tri-domain BPTI-Kunitz inhibitor capable to inhibit serine proteases and A-like metallocarboxypeptidases. The BPTI-Kunitz family of proteins includes voltage gated channel blockers and inhibitors of serine proteases. SmCI is therefore, the only BPTI-Kunitz protein capable of inhibiting metallocarboxypeptidases. The X-ray structure of the SmCI-carboxypeptidase A complex previously obtained by us, revealed that this enzyme interacts with SmCI N-tail. In the complex, the reactive loops for serine protease inhibition remain fully exposed to the solvent in each domain, suggesting SmCI can simultaneously interact with multiple serine proteases. The twofold goals of this study were: i) to establish serine proteases-SmCI binding stoichiometry, given that the inhibitor is comprised of three potential binding domains; and ii) to determine whether or not SmCI can simultaneously bind both classes of enzymes, to which it binds individually. Our experimental approach included a variety of techniques for the study of protein-protein interactions, using as model enzymes pancreatic trypsin, elastase and carboxypeptidase A. In particular, we combined information obtained from gel filtration chromatography, denaturing electrophoresis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and enzyme inhibition assays. Our results show that SmCI is able to bind three trypsin molecules under saturating conditions, but only one elastase interacts with the inhibitor. Additionally, we demonstrated that SmCI can bind serine proteases and carboxypeptidases at the same time (at least in the ratio 1: 1: 1), becoming the first protease inhibitor that simultaneously blocks these two mechanistic classes of enzymes.

AB Salmonella Typhimurium is an enteric pathogen that has evolved masterful strategies to enable survival under stress conditions both within and outside a host. The acid tolerance response (ATR) is one such mechanism that enhances the viability of acid adapted bacteria to lethal pH levels. While numerous studies exist on the protein coding components of this response, there is very little data on the roles of small RNAs (sRNAs). These non-coding RNA molecules have recently been shown to play roles as regulators of bacterial stress response and virulence pathways. They function through complementary base pairing interactions with target mRNAs and affect their translation and/or stability. There are also a few that directly bind to proteins by mimicking their respective targets. Here, we identify several sRNAs expressed during the ATR of S. Typhimurium and characterize one highly induced candidate, RyeC. Further, we identify ptsI as a trans-encoded target that is directly regulated by this sRNA. From a functional perspective, over-expression of RyeC in Salmonella produced a general attenuation of several in vitro phenotypes including acid survival, motility, adhesion and invasion of epithelial cell lines as well as replication within macrophages. Together, this study highlights the diverse roles played by sRNAs in acid tolerance and virulence of S. Typhimurium. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In order to monitor conformational changes following photoactivation and phosphorylation of bovine rhodopsin, the two reactive sulfhydryl groups at Cys(140) and Cys(316) were specifically labeled with the monobromobimane (mBBr) fluorophore. Although alterations in conformation after light exposure of rhodopsin were not detected by fluorescence excitation scans (300-450 nm) of the mBBr-labeled protein, the fluorescence signal was reduced similar to 90% in samples containing photoactivated phosphorhodopsin. Predominant labeling at either Cys(140) or Cys(316) in light-activated and phosphorylated rhodopsin merely generated a decrease of similar to 38% and 28%, respectively, in the fluorescence excitation intensity. Thus, neither mBBr-modified Cys(140) nor mBBr-modified Cys(316) were involved single-handedly in the remarkable fall seen on the signal following phosphorylation of the protein; rather, the incorporation of phosphate groups on the mBBr-labeled light-activated rhodopsin appeared to affect its fluorescence signal in a cooperative or synergistic manner. These findings demonstrated that the phosphorylation of specific hydroxyl groups at the carboxyl terminal tail of rhodopsin causes definite conformational changes in the three-dimensional fold of the protein. Apparently, amino acid residues that are buried in the interior of the inactive protein become accessible following illumination and phosphorylation of rhodopsin, quenching in turn the fluorescence excitation signal of mBBr-modified rhodopsin.

AB Quadruplexes are noncanonical DNA structures that arise in guanine rich loci and have important biological functions. Classically, quadruplexes contain four stacked intramolecular G-tetrads. Surprisingly, although some algorithms allow searching for longer than 4G tracts for quadruplex formation, these have not yet been systematically studied. Therefore, we analyzed the human genome for sequences that are predicted to adopt stacked intramolecular G-tetrads with greater than four stacks. The data provide evidence for numerous G-quadruplexes that contain five or six stacked intramolecular G-tetrads. These sequences are predominantly found in known gene regulatory regions. Electrophoretic mobility assays and circular dichroism spectroscopy indicate that these sequences form quadruplex structures in vitro under physiological conditions. The localization and in vitro stability of these G-quadruplexes indicate their potentially important roles in gene regulation and their potential for therapeutic applications.

AB Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease associated with accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated, and ubiquitinated TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) as inclusion deposits in neuronal cells. Recently, amyloid-like fibrillar aggregates of TDP-43 have been reported from several ALS patients. The C-terminal region of TDP-43 is central to TDP-43's pathological aggregation and most of the familial ALS mutations in the encoding TARDBP gene are located in this domain. Also, aberrant proteolytic cleavages of TDP-43 produce cytotoxic C-terminal fragments of similar to 15-35 kDa. The C-terminal end harbours a glycine-rich region and a Q/N rich prion-like aggregation-prone domain which has been shown to form amyloid-like fibrillar aggregates in vitro. Previously, TDP-43 protein has also been shown to undergo several other post-translational modifications such as acetylation and dimerization, however, their effects on TDP-43's amyloid-like in vitro aggregation have not been examined. Towards this, we have here examined effects of anions, acetylation and homodimerization on the in vitro aggregation of a C-terminal fragment (amino acid: 193-414) of TDP-43 termed TDP-43(2C). We find that kosmotropic anions greatly accelerate whereas chaotropic anions impede its aggregation. Also, we show that acetylation of certain lysines in C-terminal fragments significantly reduces the TDP-43(2C)'s amyloid-like aggregation. Furthermore, we separated spontaneously formed cysteine-linked homodimers of the recombinantly purified TDP-43(2C) using size-exclusion chromatography and found that these dimers retain amyloidogenicity. These findings would be of significance to the TDP-43 aggregation-induced pathology in ALS. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB Clustered apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites are more cytotoxic than isolated AP lesions because double strand breaks (DSB) can be formed during repair of closely positioned bistranded AP sites. Formation of DSB due to simultaneous cleavage of bistranded AP sites may be regulated by proteins specifically interacting with this complex lesion. A set of AP DNA duplexes containing AP sites in both strands in different mutual orientation (BS-AP DNAs) was used for search in the extracts of human cells proteins specifically recognizing clustered AP sites. A protein, which formed the Schiff-base-dependent covalent products having an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa with the subset of BS-AP DNAs, was identified by mass spectrometry as apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1). The identity of trapped protein was confirmed byWestern blot analysis with anti-APE1 antibodies. Purified recombinant human APE1 is also capable of forming the 50 kDa-adducts with efficiency of BS-AP DNAs cross-linking to APE1 being dependent on the mutual orientation of AP sites.
   In spite of formation of the Schiff-base-dependent intermediate, which is prerequisite for the belimination mechanism, APE1 is unable to cleave AP sites. APE1 lacking the first 34 amino acids at the Nterminus, unlike wild type enzyme, is unable to form cross-links with BS-AP DNAs that testifies to the involvement of disordered N-terminal extension, which is enriched in lysine residues, in the interaction with AP sites. The yield of APE1-AP DNA cross-links was found to correlate with the enzyme amount in the extracts estimated by the immunochemical approach; therefore the BS-AP DNA-probes can be useful for comparative analysis of APE1 content in cell extracts.

AB Protein evolution is potentially governed by protein stability. Here, we investigated the relationship between protein evolution and stability through the random mutational drift of a thermophilic bacterial protein, an esterase of Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius (Aac-Est), at high and low temperatures. In the first random mutation of Aac-Est, few proteins exhibit increased activity at 65 degrees C, indicating that the wildtype (WT) Aac-Est is located on the peak of a mountain in a fitness landscape for activity at high temperature. To obtain higher active variants than those of WT, it must go down the mountain once and climb another, higher mountain. In the second and third generations from lower active templates, the evolvability (the proportion of variants with higher activity in all the variants obtained in a given generation than a parent protein) depended on the stability of the template proteins. Compared to WT, the stability-maintaining template could recover the activity more. Thus, a low-activity variant with high stability is able to drift vastly in sequence space and reach the foot of a higher mountain. Meanwhile, random mutations in stability-loss templates produced several variants with higher activity at 40 degrees C than those produced by WT, via cold adaptation. Our results indicate thatmaintaining protein stability enables the protein to search sequence space and evolve in the original environment, and proteins with lost stability use a cold adaptation path.

AB In organ fibrosis, mechanical stress and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta 1) promote differentiation into myofibroblast from mesenchymal cells, leading to extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling or active synthesis, deposition or degradation of ECM components. A major component of ECM, type I collagen (col I) triple helical molecules assemble into fibrils or are denatured to gelatin without triplehelicity in remodeling. However, whether changes of ECM components in remodeling have influence on mesenchymal cell differentiation remains elusive. This study adopted three states of collagen I existing in ECM remodeling: molecular collagen, fibrillar collagen and gelatin to see what are characteristics in the effects on two cell lines of mesenchymal origin, murine 3T3-L1 embryonic fibroblast and murine C2C12 myoblasts. The results showed that all three forms of collagen I were capable of inducing these two cells to differentiate into myofibroblasts characterized by increased expression of alphasmooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) mRNA. The expression of alpha-SMA is positively regulated by TGF-beta 1. Nuclear translocation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) is involved in this process. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is activated in the cells cultured on molecular collagen-coated plates, contributing to YAP activation. On the other hand, in the cells cultured on fibrillar collagen gel or gelatin-coated plates, oxidative stress but not FAK induce YAP activation. In conclusion, the three physicochemically distinct forms of col I induce the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into myofibroblasts through different pathways.

AB Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-borne pathogenic virus that reemerged and caused epidemic in the Indian Ocean island of La Reunion, is a potential public health threat. Currently there is no antiviral drug or vaccine commercially available for the treatment of chikungunya fever, which necessitates the urge for an effective antiviral therapy for chikungunya treatment. In the present study, a FRET based protease assay was used to analyze the proteolytic activity of chikungunya nsP2 protease (CHIKV nsP2pro) - an essential viral enzyme, with fluorogenic substrate peptide. This protease assay was used to assess the inhibitory activity of Pep-I (MMsINC (R) database ID MMs03131094) and Pep-II (MMsINC (R) database ID MMs03927237), peptidomimetic compounds identified in a previous study by our group. Both compounds inhibited CHIKV nsP2pro with half maximal inhibition concentration (IC50) values of -34 mu M and -42 mu M, respectively. Kinetic studies showed that the inhibition constant (K-i)value is 33.34 +/- 2.53 mu M for Pep-I and 45.89 4.38 mu M for Pep-II. Additionally, these two compounds significantly inhibited CHIKV replication in BHK-21 cells at concentrations much lower than their cytotoxic concentrations. Intriguingly, these compounds did not show inhibitory effect on Sindbis virus. This suggests that Pep-I and Pep-II compounds identified as CHIKV nsP2 substrate peptidomimetics, specifically inhibit CHIKV replication.

AB Harish and Kurland recently compared two evolutionary models that root the tree of life. Both models make use of unordered phylogenetic characters. Here we show that they confused one of their models with models that use Wagner ordered characters. In addition, we also show that these Wagner characters should be polarized a posteriori with the generality criterion and not with external outgroup hypotheses. These facts question the rationale of their comparative phylogenomic exercise. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM). All rights reserved.

AB During pregnancy, exposure to environmental contaminants can lead to adverse effects on fetal growth and development, especially by targeting the placenta. Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), the most abundant chemical used in plastic materials, is known to induce toxicity on animals reproductive system and is suspected to give rise to similar effect in humans. Toxicity of DEHP is due to its main metabolite, MEHP, which is also known to disturb lipid synthesis in several organs. Moreover, mono-(2-ethylhexyl)phtalate (MEHP) is a high affinity ligand of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPAR gamma which is essential for placental development and lipid metabolism. In order to investigate possible lipid disruptions induced by MEHP, in the JEG-3 human trophoblast cell line, a differential lipidomic analysis was carried out by UPLC-MS on both exposed and control cells. Our results showed that MEHP induced an important change of JEG-3 cells lipidome, especially in glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids, with a marked accumulation of triacylglycerols. For the first time, our results highlighted adverse effects of MEHP on human placental cells lipidome and thus, its potential effect on placental physiology.

AB In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of a lipid transfer protein isolated from Morinda citrifolia L. seeds, named McLTP(1), i, and to investigate its effect in the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse sepsis model. Antimicrobial assays revealed that McLTP(1) (12.5-800 mu g/mL) significantly reduced Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538P and ATCC 14458) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228) planktonic growth, reaching maximal inhibition of approximately 50% and 98%, respectively. Furthermore, McLTP(1) inhibited biofilm formation of both S. aureus strains, achieving percentages ranging from 39.1% to 69.1% (200-800 jig/mL) for ATCC 6538P and 34.4%-63% (12.5-800 mu g/mL) for ATCC 14458. A synergistic interaction between McLTP(1) and oxacillin against S. aureus and S. epidermidis was also observed, as determined by fractional inhibitory concentration indices of 0.18 and 0.38, respectively. McLTP(1) showed no significant inhibitory effect against Gram-negative bacteria. In the in vivo experiments, sepsis was lethal to 83% of the animals, 72 h after CLP. In contrast, 100% of the animals treated with McLTP(1) (8 mg/kg) before (intraperitoneal injection or oral dose) or after (oral dose) CLP were still alive 3 days later. In addition, oral or intraperitoneal administration of McLTP(1) (8 mg/kg) significantly reduced the body weight loss, fever, leukocytosis, organ damage, and the level of inflammatory serum cytokines induced by sepsis. In conclusion, McLTP(1) could be exploited for its antimicrobial properties, and can be considered a potential therapeutic candidate for the management of clinical sepsis.

AB Malonyl-CoA:acyl carrier protein transacylase (FabD), being an essential enzyme of the FAS II pathway, is an attractive target for developing broad-spectrum antibiotics. It performs initiation reaction to form malonyl-ACP, which is a key building block in fatty acid biosynthesis. In this study, we have characterized the FabD from drug-resistant pathogen Moraxella catarrhalis (McFabD). More importantly, we have shown the binding of McFabD with three new compounds from the class of aporphine alkaloids. ITC based binding studies have shown that apomorphine is binding to McFabD with a stronger affinity (K-D = 4.87 mu M) as compared to boldine (K-D = 7.19 mu M) and magnoflorine (K-D = 11.7 mu M). The possible mechanism of fluorescence quenching is found to be static with K-q values higher than 10(10), which was associated with the ground state complex formation of aporphine alkaloids with McFabD. Conforma-tional changes observed in the secondary and tertiary structure marked by the loss of helical content during the course of interactions. Molecular docking based studies have predicted the binding mode of aporphine alkaloids and it is found that these compounds are interacting in a similar fashion as known inhibitor corytuberine is interacting with McFabD. The analysis of docking poses have revealed that His 210, Leu102, GIn19, Ser101 and Arg 126 are critical residues, which may play important role in binding. The growth inhibition assay has shown that apomorphine has better MIC value (4-8 mu g/ml) against Moraxella catarrhalis as compared to boldine and magnoflorine. Therefore, the current study suggests that aporphine alkaloids can act as antibacterial agents and possible target of these compounds could be FabD enzyme from the FAS II pathway, and apomorphine scaffold will be more suitable among these compounds for potential development of antibacterial agents.(C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB Fumonisin B1 toxin (FB1) is a well-known competitive inhibitor of ceramide synthase (CS) in yeast. However, FB1 is unable to obstruct CS from Trichoderma spp., which are well-known biocontrol agents. To explore the contrasting binding modes, a comparative structural analysis of complexes of FB1 with these two CS proteins was carried out. Formation of activation loop on the binding of substrates with the CS from yeast was observed but when inhibitor interacted with the activation loop, it transformed into helix leading to the potentially inactivated state of the enzyme. In yeast homologue of the enzyme, the inhibitor and substrates compete for the same binding site. Whereas, in the CS protein from Trichoderma guizhouense, no such competition for substrate binding site was observed and the binding pocket of the enzyme could easily accommodate FB1 molecule along with the two interacting native substrates, which may lead to the successful catalysis.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Egr2 and Egr4 upregulation on ischemic stroke recovery of rats.
   Methods: In this study, Sprague Dawley (SD) rats assigned at random into control, sham and MCAO (middle cerebral artery occlusion) group were treated accordingly to build MCAO models. The neurological severity scores (NSS) test was applied to assess rats' behavior. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining reflected infarct areas while Nissl staining revealed the number of neurons. Levels of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1 beta, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) were judged by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in brain and serum tissues. We applied western blot to check the expression of Egr2, Egr4 and JNIK/c-JUN (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) pathway. Further grouping of rats were based on various transfection, requiring control, sham, MCAO, MCAO + Egr2 cDNA (complementary DNA), MCAO + Egr4 cDNA, MCAO + Egr2 cDNA + Egr4 cDNA group to observe difference in MCAO recovery and JNK/c-JUN-pathway-related protein expression.
   Results: Under successful modeling of MCAO, western blot results suggested down-regulation of Egr2 and Egr4 and overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The JNIK/c-JUN pathway was activated. On upregulation of Egr2 and Egr4 in infarct areas, neurological function of SD rats recovered along with repressed JNIK/c-JUN pathway activation and increased neuron number.
   Conclusion: Upregulation of Egr2 and Egr4 could demote the activation of JNIK/c-JUN pathway and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in MCAO rats, so that Egr2 and Egr4 might be potential targets for ischemic stroke in future.

AB Subunit I of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) from mitochondria and many bacteria contains a cation binding site (CBS) located at the outer positively charged aqueous phase not far from heme a. Binding of Ca2+ with the CBS in bovine CcO inhibits activity of the enzyme 2-3 -fold [Vygodina, T., Kirichenko, A. & Konstantinov A.A. (2013) Direct Regulation of Cytochrome c Oxidase by Calcium Ions, PLoS One. 8 e744361. Here we show that binding of Ca2+ at CBS of bovine CcO shifts E-m, of heme a to the positive by 15-20 mV. Na+ ions that bind to the same site and compete with Ca2+ do not affect E-m, of heme a and also prevent and reverse the effect of Ca2+. No effect of Ca2+ or EGTA is observed on E-m, of heme a with the wild type bacterial oxidases from R.sphaeroides or P.denitrificans that contain tightly-bound calcium at the site. In the D477A mutant CcO from P. denitrificans that binds Ca2+ reversibly like the mitochondria[CcO, calcium shifts redox titration curve of heme a to the positive by similar to 35-50 mV that is in good agreement with the results of electrostatic calculations; however, as shown earlier, it does not inhibit CcO activity of the mutant enzyme. Therefore the data do not support the proposal that the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ on CcO activity may be explained by the Ca2+-induced shift of E-m, of heme a. Rather, Ca2+ retards electron transfer by inhibition of charge dislocation in the exit part of the proton channel H in mammalian CcO, that is absent in the bacterial oxidases.

AB UHRF1 is a multi-domain protein comprising of a tandem tudor (UHRF1 TTD), a PHD finger, and a SET and RING-associated domain. It is required for the maintenance of CG methylation, heterochromatin formation and DNA repair. Isothermal titration calorimetry binding studies of unmodified and methylated lysine histone peptides establish that the UHRF1 TTD binds dimethylated Lys9 on histone H3 (H3K9me2). Further, MD simulation and binding studies reveal that TTD-PHD of UHRF1 (UHRF1 TTD-PHD) preferentially recognizes dimethyl-lysine status. Importantly, we show that Asp145 in the binding pocket determines the preferential recognition of the dimethyl-ammonium group of H3K9me2. Interestingly, PHD finger of the UHRF1 TTD-PHD has a negligible contribution to the binding affinity for recognition of K9me2 by the UHRF1 TTD. Surprisingly, Lys4 methylation on H3 peptide has an insignificant effect on combinatorial recognition of R2 and K9me2 on H3 by the UHRF1 TTD-PHD. We propose that subtle variations of key residues at the binding pocket determine status specific recognition of histone methyl-lysines by the reader domains.

ID STEROID 21-HYDROXYLASE GENES; DEFICIENCY; SPECTRUM; FORMS
AB Steroid 21-Hydroxylase deficiency is an inherited autosomal recessive metabolic disorder of the adrenal steroidogenesis caused due to mutations in the CYP21A2 gene in 95% of CAH cases. Notably, the de novo mutations arise at the rate of 3-5%, therefore the functional characterization is of utmost importance for categorization of the novel mutations. Herein, we have functionally characterized the CYP21A2 missense mutations viz., p. F306V and p. H365N. Notably, both the mutations were harbored by the patients exhibiting the non classical phenotype. We followed the approach of in vitro characterization of the mutant proteins expressed in COS7 cells. Of note, all the mutant constructs exhibited reduced residual enzyme activity fraternized with altered kinetic constants accompanied by higher requirement for the activation energy. Further, there was reduced protein expression in the mutant constructs to that of the wild-type. Molecular modeling suggested alteration in the structure-function relationship of the protein due to mutations. The evidence suggested by the in vitro and the in silico characterization of mutations directed us to conclude that both, p. F306V and p. H365N should be considered as non classical CAH causing mutations. Conceivably, the knowledge about the functional consequences of the mutations is the basis for improved genetic counseling with respect to prognosis and therapeutic implications.

AB Pericentromeric heterochromatin plays important roles in controlling gene expression and cellular differentiation. Fluorescent pyrrole-imidazole polyamides targeting murine pericentromeric DNA (major satellites) can be used for the visualization of pericentromeric heterochromatin foci in live mouse cells. New derivatives targeting human repeated DNA sequences (alpha-satellites) were synthesized and their interaction with target DNA was characterized. The possibility to use major satellite and alpha -satellite binding polyamides as tools for staining pericentromeric heterochromatin was further investigated in fixed and living mouse and human cells. The staining that was previously observed using the mouse model was further characterized and optimized, but remained limited regarding the fluorophores that can be used. The promising results regarding the staining in the mouse model could not be extended to the human model. Experiments performed in human cells showed chromosomal DNA staining without selectivity.

AB We recently analyzed the robustness of competing evolution models developed to identify the root of the Tree of Life: 1) An empirical Sankoff parsimony (ESP) model (Harish and Kurland, 2017), which is a nonstationary and directional evolution model; and 2) An a priori ancestor (APA) model (Kim and Caetano-Anolles, 2011) that is a stationary and reversible evolution model. Both Bayesian model selection tests as well as maximum parsimony analyses demonstrate that the ESP model is, overwhelmingly, the better model. Moreover, we showed that the APA model is not only sensitive to artifacts, but also that the underlying assumptions are neither empirically grounded nor biologically realistic.

AB One of the three domains of kinetoplastid NADH:fumarate oxidoreductase (FRD) is homologous to bacterial flavin transferase that catalyzes transfer of FMN residue from FAD to threonine in flavoproteins. Leptomonas pyrrhocoris FRD produced in yeast cells, which lack flavin transferase gene in their proteome, reduces fumarate in the presence of NADH and contains an FMN residue covalently linked to a Ser9 residue. The conserved flavinylation motif of FRD, D-3(g/s)x(s/t)(s/g)AS(9), is similar to the Dxx(s/t)gAT motif recognized by flavin transferase in prokaryotic proteins. Ser9 replacement abolished the flavinylation and fumarate reductase activity of FRD. These findings suggest that the flavinylation is important for the activity of FRD and that this post-translational modification is carried out by the own flavin transferase domain.

AB Muscle mass loss and wasting are characteristic features of patients with chronic conditions including cancer. Beta-adrenoceptors attenuate muscle wasting. We hypothesized that specific muscle atrophy signaling pathways and altered metabolism may be attenuated in cancer cachectic animals receiving treatment with the beta(2) agonist formoterol. In diaphragm and gastrocnemius of tumor-bearing rats (intraperitoneal inoculum, 10(8) AH-130 Yoshida ascites hepatoma cells, 7-day study period) with and without treatment with formoterol (0.3 mg/kg body weight/day/7days, subcutaneous), atrophy signaling pathways (NF-kappa B, MAPK, FoxO), proteolytic markers (ligases, proteasome, ubiquitination), autophagy markers (p62, beclin-1, LC3), myostatin, apoptosis, muscle metabolism markers, and muscle structure features were analyzed (immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry). In diaphragm and gastrocnemius of cancer cachectic rats, fiber sizes were reduced, levels of structural alterations, atrophy signaling pathways, proteasome content, protein ubiquitination, autophagy, and myostatin were increased, while those of regenerative and metabolic markers (myoD, mTOR, AKT, and PGC-lalpha) were decreased. Formoterol treatment attenuated such alterations in both muscles. Muscle wasting in this rat model of cancer-induced cachexia was characterized by induction of significant structural alterations, atrophy signaling pathways, proteasome activity, apoptotic and autophagy markers, and myostatin, along with a significant decline in the expression of muscle regenerative and metabolic markers. Treatment of the cachectic rats with formoterol partly attenuated the structural alterations and atrophy signaling, while improving other molecular perturbations similarly in both respiratory and limb muscles. The results reported in this study have relevant therapeutic implications as they showed beneficial effects of the beta 2 agonist formoterol in the cachectic muscles through several key biological pathways.

AB Sialidase catalyzes the removal of sialic acids from glycoconjugates. Different from Neu1 and Neu3 sialidases, Neu4 enzymatic properties such as substrate specificity and subcellular localization are not well-conserved among vertebrates. In fish only zebrafish and medaka neu4 genes have been cloned and their polypeptides have been characterized so far. Thus, characterization of Neu4 from other fish species is necessary to evaluate Neu4 physiological functions. Here, Nile tilapia was chosen for the characterization of Neu4 polypeptide considering that it is one of the major cultured fish all over the world and that its genomic sequences are now available. Coding DNA sequence of tilapia Neu4 was identified as 1,497 bp and its recombinant protein showed broad substrate specificity and optimal sialidase enzyme activity pH at 4.0. Neu4 activity was sustained even in neutral and alkali pH. Interestingly, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that major subcellular localization of tilapia Neu4 was nuclear, quite distinct from zebrafish (ER) and medaka Neu4 (lysosome). Bioinformatic analysis showed the existence of putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) in tilapia Neu4. In general, it is known that importin families bind to several proteins via NLS and transfer them into nucleus. Therefore, to determine the involvement of putative NLS in Neu4 nuclear localization, Neu4 mutant deleting NLS was constructed and expressed in cultured cells. As a result, NLS deletion significantly diminished the nuclear localization. Furthermore, treatment of importazole, interrupter of binding importin beta and RanGTP, significantly suppressed Neu4 nuclear localization. In summary, tilapia Neu4 is a unique sialidase localized at nucleus and its transport system into nucleus is regulated by importin.

AB A novel extracellular laccase was purified from fermentation broth of the white rot fungus Trametes sp. F1635 by a three-step protocol including two consecutive ion-exchange chromatography steps on DEAE-Sepharose and SP-Sepharose, and a final gel-filtration on Superdex 75. The purified laccase (TsL) was a monomeric protein with the molecular mass of 64.8 kDa. It demonstrated high oxidation activity of 4.00 x 10(4) U/mg towards ABTS. Its N-terminal amino acid sequence was AIGPVADLTIINNAV which was unique and sharing high similarity of other fungal laccases. TsL was a yellow laccase based on absorption spectrum analysis. It demonstrated an acidic pH optimum of 2.6 and temperature optimum of 50 degrees C towards ABTS. The K-m and V-max values towards ABTS were estimated to 18.58 mu M and 1.35 mu mol/min, respectively. TsL manifested effective decolorization activity towards eriochrome black T (EBT), remazol brilliant blue R (RBBR), malachite green (MG), and eriochrome black T (EBT) (over 60%). Violuric acid (VA) and acetosyringone (AS) were the optimal mediators for the laccase in dye decolorization. Results suggest that TsL demonstrates great potential for dye decolorization and water treatment. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB A steady-state absorption and emission spectroscopy was used to create a comprehensive work and to study the interaction of the wild type Escherichia coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase and its mutants, PNPF159Y and PNPF159A, with a potent E. coli PNP inhibitor - formycin A. The absorption and emission spectra were recorded in the presence and absence of the phosphate at the 50mM concentration. From the collected sets of data dissociation constants (K-d), apparent dissociation constants (K-app) and Hill's coefficients (h) were calculated. Additionally, the temperature dependence of the enzymes emission quenching at two temperatures, 10 degrees C and 25 degrees C, was examined. To verify the calculations, total difference absorption spectra were computed for all types of the complexes. A prominent quenching of the PNPF159Y emission indicates a complex formation, with the strongest association in the phosphate buffer, pH 7, relative to the wild type enzyme. On the other hand, results testify to a deterioration of the interactions in the E. coli PNP/PNPF159Y and formycin A complexes in the presence of the phosphate, pH 8.3. Moreover, data obtained for the PNPF159A-FA complexes confirm a weak association of the FA to the mutant's active center.

AB Leucine-rich repeats and WD repeat domain-containing protein 1 (LRWD1) is implicated in the regulation of signal transduction, transcription, RNA processing and tumor development. However, LRWD1 transcriptional regulation is not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between LRWD1 expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in human embryonal carcinoma cell line, NT2/D1 cells, which will help in understanding the transcriptional regulatory role of ROS in cells. Results showed that the exposure of NT2/D1 cells to various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the nitric oxide (NO) donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) caused a significant increase in the mRNA and protein expression of LRWD1. In addition, LRWD1 promoter luciferase reporter assay, and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation assay (CHIP assay) showed that nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor (Nrf2) was involved in the regulation of LRWD1 expression in response to oxidative stress. The involvement of Nrf2 was confirmed by shRNA-mediated knockdown of Nrf2 in NT2/D1 cells, which caused a significant decrease in LRWD1 expression in response to oxidative stress. Similarly, LRWD1 knockdown resulted in the accumulation of H2O2 and superoxide anion radical (O2-). Blocking ROS production by N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) protected NT2/D1 shLRWD1cells from H2O2-induced cell death. Collectively, oxidative stress increased LRWD1 expression through a Nrf2-dependent mechanism, which plays an important role in cellular adaptation to oxidative stress. These results highlight an evidence, on the molecular level, about LRWD1 transcriptional regulation under oxidative stress.

AB Bifidobacterium is an important genus of probiotic bacteria colonizing the human gut. These bacteria can uptake oligosaccharides for the fermentative metabolism of hexoses and pentoses, producing lactate, acetate as well as short-chain fatty acids and propionate. These end-products are known to have important effects on human health. beta-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21) are pivotal enzymes for the metabolism and homeostasis of Bifidobacterium, since they hydrolyze small and soluble saccharides, typically producing glucose. Here we describe the cloning, expression, biochemical characterization and the first Xray structure of a GH3 beta-glucosidase from the probiotic bacteria Bifidobacterium adolescentis (BaBgl3). The purified BaBgl3 showed a maximal activity at 45 degrees C and pH 6.5. Under the optimum conditions, BaBgl3 is highly active on 4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG) and, at a lesser degree, on 4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside (pNPX, about 32% of the activity observed for pNPG). The 2.4 A resolution crystal structure of BaBgl3 revealed a three-domain structure composed of a TIM barrel domain, which together with alpha/beta sandwich domain accommodate the active site and a third C-terminal fibronectin type III (FnIII) domain with unknown function. Modeling of the substrate in the active site indicates that an aspartate interacts with the hydroxyl group of the C6 present in pNPG but absent in pNPX, which explains the substrate preference. Finally, the enzyme is significantly stabilized by glycerol and galactose, resulting in considerable increase in the enzyme activity and its lifetime. The structural and biochemical studies presented here provide a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of complex carbohydrates degradation utilized by probiotic bacteria as well as for the development of new prebiotic oligosaccharides.

AB Initiation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is common in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and may contribute to its metastasis. Aims of the present study are to investigate whether and how the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)-5/C-X-C motif receptor 2 (CXCR2) axis affects PTC metastasis, with a focus on the EMT process. Herein, two PTC cell lines, KTC-1 and B-CPAP cells, identified as CXCR2-positive cells were used as the cell model. We found that a 24-h stimulation of 1 or 10 nM recombinant human CXCL5 (rhCXCL5) enhanced the migration and invasion of both KTC-1 and B-CPAP cells without affecting their proliferation. The migration- and invasion-promoting effects of rhCXCL5 were attenuated if CXCR2 was silenced by its specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). EMT initiation is defined as downregulation of epithelial-cadherin (E-cadherin) and upregulation of N-cadherin, Vimentin and Snail. Our data showed that rhCXCL5-induced EMT in PTC cells was suppressed by CXCR2 shRNA. Furthermore, the active CXCL5-CXCR2 axis enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser 473 residue and that of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3b) at Ser 9 residue, and accelerated the nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin in PTC cells. Re-expression of the active form of beta-catenin in PTC cells rescued their impaired invasiveness caused by the blockade of CXCL5-CXCR2 axis. In addition, CXCL5 and CXCR2 were over-expressed in the metastatic lymph nodes obtained from 18 patients with PTC. In summary, our study demonstrates that the activated CXCL5-CXCR2 axis contributes to the metastatic phenotype of PTC cells by modulating Akt/GSK-3 beta/beta-catenin pathway.

AB Estrogen production by the human villous trophoblast is dependent on the biosynthetic enzyme aromatase (CYP19; CYP19A1) and is crucial for successful placental development and pregnancy outcome. Using villous cytotrophoblast cells (vCTs) freshly isolated from normal term placenta, we characterized the promoter-specific expression of CYP19A1 mRNA (derived from promoters I. 1, 1.4, 1.8 or total transcript) and aromatase activity during villous trophoblast syncytialization. CYP19A1 mRNA levels and aromatase activity in vCTs reached a maximum after about 48 h of culture. The cAMP inducer forskolin (10 mu M) and protein kinase C stimulant phorbol myristate acetate (1 mu M) increased CYP19A1 mRNA levels by 1.8- and 1.6-fold, respectively, as well as inducing aromatase catalytic activity. Dexamethasone (100 mu M) and vascular endothelial growth factor (5 ng/mL) decreased CYP19A1 mRNA levels, while having no effect on aromatase activity. Our results emphasize the importance of not solely studying CYP19A1 regulation and function at the mRNA level but also considering posttranslational mechanisms that alter the final catalytic activity of aromatase.

AB Sticholysin II (StII) is a pore-forming toxin of biomedical interest that belongs to the actinoporin protein family. Sticholysins are currently under examination as an active immunomodulating component of a vaccinal platform against tumoral cells and as a key element of a nucleic acids delivery system to cell cytosol. These proteins form pores in the plasma membrane leading to ion imbalance and cell lysis. However, the intracellular mechanisms triggered by actinoporins upon binding to membranes and its consequences for cell death are barely understood. Here, we have examined the cytotoxicity and intracellular responses induced by StII upon binding to human B-cell lymphoma Raji in vitro. StII cytotoxicity involves a functional actin cytoskeleton, induces cellular swelling, lysis and the concomitant release of cytosol content. In addition, StII induces calcium release mainly from the Endoplasmic Reticulum, activates Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase ERK and impairs mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, StII stimulates the expression of receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1), normally related to different forms of regulated cell death such as apoptosis and necroptosis. In correspondence, necrostatin-1, an inhibitor of this kinase, reduces StII cytotoxicity. However, the mechanism of cell death activated by StII does not involve caspases activation, typical molecular features of apoptosis and pyroptosis. Our results suggest that, beyond pore-formation and cell lysis, StII-induced cytotoxicity could involve other regulated intracellular mechanisms connected to RIP1-MEK1/2-ERK1/2- pathways. This opens new perspectives and challenges the general point of view that these toxins induce a completely unregulated mechanism of necrotic cell death. This study contributes to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in toxin-cell interaction and the implications for cell functioning, with connotation for the exploitations of these toxins in clinical settings.

AB The functional and bioenergetics impact of regular physical activity upon type-2 diabetic skeletal muscle independently of confounding factors of overweight remains undocumented. Here, gastrocnemius muscle energy fluxes, mitochondrial capacity and mechanical performance were assessed noninvasively and longitudinally in non-obese diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and dynamic 31-phosphorus MR spectroscopy (31P-MRS) throughout a 6-min fatiguing bout of exercise performed before, in the middle (4-week) and at the end of an 8-week training protocol consisting in 60-min daily run on a treadmill. The training protocol reduced plasmatic insulin level (-61%) whereas blood glucose and non-esterified fatty acids levels remained unaffected, thereby indicating an improvement of insulin sensitivity. It also increased muscle mitochondrial citrate synthase activity (+45%) but this increase did not enhance oxidative ATP synthesis capacity in working muscle in vivo while glycolytic ATP production was increased (+33%). On the other hand, the training protocol impaired maximal force-generating capacity (-9%), total amount of force produced (-12%) and increased ATP cost of contraction (+32%) during the fatiguing exercise. Importantly, these deleterious effects were transiently worsened in the middle of the 8-week period, in association with reduced oxidative capacity and increased basal [P-i]/[PCr] ratio (an in vivo biomarker of muscle damage). These data demonstrate that the beneficial effect of regular training on insulin sensitivity in non-obese diabetic rat occurs separately from any improvement in muscle mitochondrial function and might be linked to an increased capacity for metabolizing glucose through anaerobic process in exercising muscle.

AB Cyclosporin A (CsA) is an effective immunosuppressive agent, but its myocardial toxicity limits its widespread and long-term clinical application. In this study, CsA treatment led to damages in myocardial fiber structure, an increase in myocardial fibrosis, and changes in heart size and shape; moreover, the degree of damage was exacerbated with prolonged drug application and increases in dose. However, the mechanism is not clear; therefore, the purpose of this study was to reveal the mechanism of CsA-induced myocardial fibrosis and identify a new target for the prevention and treatment of CsA-induced myocardial injury. Cardiac fibroblasts were treated with CsA (5, 10, or 20 mg/mL) for 24 h. Autophagy was observed by electron microscopy and immunofluorescence. The expression of NRP-2/WDFY-1, autophagy-related proteins (Beclin1 and LC3B), fibrosis-related proteins (MMP2/9), and fibroblast phenotype conversion factor (alpha-SMA) was evaluated by Western blot. The expression of collagen I was determined by ELISA. Then, we used the gene interference technique to alter WDFY-1 expression with or without CsA or 3-MA treatment for 24 h, and the effects on autophagy and the expression of autophagy-related proteins, fibrosis-associated proteins, IFN-alpha, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 were determined. The results showed the following: (1) CsA induced fibrosis-related protein (MMP2/9), fibroblast phenotype conversion factor (alpha-SMA), and collagen I up-regulation in a dose-dependent manner. (2) CsA induced the formation of autophagosomes and up-regulated the expression of Beclin1, LC3B, and the ERK/MAPK pathway in cardiac fibroblasts. (3) CsA induced NRP-2 down-regulation and WDFY-1 up-regulation. (4) Depletion of WDFY-1 inhibited CsA-induced autophagy, TNF-alpha and IFN-alpha up-regulation, and fibrosis. (5) The autophagy inhibitor 3-MA inhibited CsA-induced TNF-alpha and IFN-alpha up-regulation and fibrosis. Overall, cyclosporin A induces autophagy in cardiac fibroblasts through the NRP-2/WDFY-1 axis, which promotes the progression of myocardial fibrosis.

AB Notch signaling plays a pivotal role in homeostasis and cardiovascular development. The role of notch signaling in atherosclerosis cannot be complete without analysing the key role of notch in macrophages, which trigger the inflammatory response and subsequent plaque formation in atherosclerosis. Diosgenin showed its anti-atherosclerotic property by the unifying mechanism of suppressing the expression of notch signaling pathway, particularly the nuclear translocation of notch intracellular domain (NICD) in aorta and in differentiated macrophage cells. It is further confirmed by the inhibition of NICD by DAPT (N-[N-(3, 5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester), which also restricted the differentiation of macrophage. Hence, inhibition of nuclear translocation of NICD by diosgenin aids in preventing atherosclerosis. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Arrangements of nucleotides flanking the start codon in the IRES of the

AB Genomic RNA of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), a specific highly structured fragment responsible for its non-canonical translation initiation. The HCV IRES contains a major part of the 50-untranslated region of the viral RNA and a small portion of the open reading frame (ORF). At the first step of initiation, IRES directly binds to 40S ribosomal subunits so that the AUG start codon appears at the P site region without scanning and without involving initiation factors. However, it is still not entirely clear whether the IRES ORF is correctly loaded into the 40S ribosomal mRNA binding channel in the resulting binary complex. To address this issue, we applied site-directed cross-linking using HCV IRES derivatives bearing a perfluorophenyl azide cross-linker at nucleotides in definite positions relative to the adenine of the AUG start codon. We found that the modifier at the IRES position-3 cross-links to ribosomal proteins uS11 and eS26. These proteins have been identified together with uS7 as those interacting with the mRNA nucleotide in position-3 relative to the first nucleotide of the codon directed to the P site by a cognate tRNA. Thus, our results indicate a certain difference in the locations of the above parts of HCV IRES and canonical mRNAs on 40S subunits. The modifier at the IRES positions +4/5 was attached to uS19, which is specific for ribosomal complexes with the P site tRNA and similar derivatives of model canonical mRNAs when the modifier is in the same positions. However, the cross-linking efficiency of the IRES derivative was drastically lower than that previously observed with derivatives of model mRNAs. This implies that the IRES ORF portion is correctly loaded into the mRNA binding channel only in a tiny fraction of the binary complexes.

AB Hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) are a subpopulation of cells which was usually expanded in chronic liver injury and are contributed to liver regeneration through differentiating into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition is a dynamic process which is important for the progression of liver fibrosis and cancer initiation. This study demonstrated that LE/6 and WB-F344 cells, both of which were HPC derived cell lines, were undergoing partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition states, which was indicated by the co-expression of epithelial markers (E-cadherin and zona occludin 1), and mesenchymal markers (vimentin, fibronectin, collagen 1 and alpha-SMA). Furthermore, autocrine TGF-beta and activin A signaling contributed to the maintenance of partial EMT in HPCs. In addition, Smad signaling, a classic downstream signaling cascade of both TGF-beta and activin A, also participated in the partial EMT. These findings revealed the existence of partial EMT states in HPCs and confirmed some partial EMT related autocrine signaling cascades, and may help to further the understanding and explore the functional role of HPCs in the process of hepatic fibrosis and liver cancer initiation.

AB Double strand breaks (DSBs) in E. coli chromosome (such as those induced by gamma rays) are repaired by recombination repair, during which a certain amount of DNA gets degraded. We monitored DNA degradation in gamma-irradiated cells to assess processing of DSBs. DNA degradation in irradiated cells is regulated by RecA protein concentration and its affinity of ssDNA binding, as well as by exonucleases that trim 30-terminated ss tails. Here we determined the effects of proteins that affect formation and stability of RecA nucleofilaments on DNA degradation and cell survival. RecF and UvrD suppressed DNA degradation through RecA protein function and SOS induction, while also improving gamma survival. RecF and UvrD function in one pathway. Acting along with RecF, RecX suppressed DNA degradation and stimulated gamma-survival, which also depends on RecA protein and SOS induction. Furthermore, we determined a role in DNA degradation of several proteins that participate in DSB repair. RecN was required for DNA repair and for degradation suppression, acting on the RecABCD pathway. Furthermore, we show that SSB protein overproduction did not affect DNA degradation. Inactivation of RecG and RuvABC, proteins that catalyze the postsynaptic phase of recombination repair of DSBs, also did not affect DNA degradation, suggesting that once formed, recombination intermediates are not subject to DNA degradation, and that the postsynaptic phase is an irreversible, single-round process, unlike the presynaptic phase, which is mostly repetitive.

AB Hypoxia, especially altitude associated hypoxia is known to cause severe physiological alterations and life-threatening conditions. Impaired redox balance along with oxidative stress, protein carbonylation and instigation of apoptotic events are common sub-cellular events that follow the hypoxic insult. The role of nitric oxide (NO) is very dynamic and versatile in preventing the ill effects of hypoxia vis-a-vis reacting with oxidative species and causing protein nitrosylation. Although several mechanisms of NO-mediated cytoprotection are known during hypoxic insult, limited pieces of evidence are available to support the relationship between two downstream events of oxidative stress, protein carbonylation (caused by carbonyl; CO radical) and protein nitrosylation/nitration (caused by NO/peroxynitrite; ONOO radical). In this study, we investigated an entirely new aspect of NO protection in hypoxia involving crosstalk between carbonylation and nitrosylation. Using standard NO inhibitor L-NAME and simulated hypoxic conditions in hypoxia-sensitive cell line H9c2, we evaluated the levels of radicals, cell death, mitochondrial membrane potential, levels of protein nitrosylation, protein nitration and carbonylation and glutathione content. The results were then carefully analyzed in light of NO bioavailability. Our study shows that reducing NO during hypoxia caused cell death via the increased degree of carbonylation in proteins. This provides a new aspect of NO benefits which furthers opens new possibilities to explore potential mechanisms and effects of cross-talk between nitrosylation, protein nitration and carbonylation, especially through some common antioxidant mediators such as glutathione and thioredoxin.

AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic disease amongst people aged 65 and older. Increasing evidence has illustrated that early diagnosis holds the key to effective treatment of AD. A variety of detection techniques have been developed. Biosensors are excellent analytical tools which have applications in detecting the biomarkers of AD. This review includes appropriate bioreceptors to achieve highly sensitive and selective quantification of AD biomarkers by using transducers. AD biomarkers such as tau protein, amyloid beta peptides and apolipoprotein E4, are firstly summarized. The most commonly used bioreceptors, including aptamers and antibodies, are also reviewed. We introduce aptamers specific to AD biomarkers, list the sequences of aptamers designed to capture AD biomarkers and compare the properties of aptamers with those of antibodies with regard to their efficiency as bio-recognition elements. We discuss the recent progress of aptamer systems' applications in AD biomarkers in biosensing. The review also discusses novel strategies used for signal amplification in sensing AD biomarkers.

TI Identification of a new subtype of dipeptidyl peptidase 11 and a third

   Bacteroides

AB Peptidase family S46 consists of two types of dipeptidyl- peptidases (DPPs), DPP7 and DPP11, which liberate dipeptides from the N-termini of polypeptides along with the penultimate hydrophobic and acidic residues, respectively. Their specificities are primarily defined by a single amino acid residue, Gly673 in DPP7 and Arg673 in DPP11 (numbering for Porphyromonas gingivalis DPP11). Bacterial species in the phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes generally possess one gene for each, while Bacteroides species exceptionally possess three genes, one gene as DPP7 and two genes as DPP11, annotated based on the full-length similarities. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the above-mentioned Bacteroides S46 DPPs. A recombinant protein of the putative DPP11 gene BF9343_2924 from Bacteroides fragilis harboring Gly673 exhibited DPP7 activity by hydrolyzing Leu-Leu-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (MCA). Another gene, BF9343_2925, as well as the Bacteroides vulgatus gene (BVU_2252) with Arg673 was confirmed to encode DPP11. These results demonstrated that classification of S46 peptidase is enforceable by the S1 essential residues. Bacteroides DPP11 showed a decreased level of activity towards the substrates, especially with P1-position Glu. Findings of 3D structural modeling indicated three potential amino acid substitutions responsible for the reduction, one of which, Asn650Thr substitution, actually recovered the hydrolyzing activity of Leu-Glu-MCA. On the other hand, the gene currently annotated as DPP7 carrying Gly673 from B. fragilis (BF9343_0130) and Bacteroides ovatus (Bovatus_03382) did not hydrolyze any of the examined substrates. The existence of a phylogenic branch of these putative Bacteroides DPP7 genes classified by the C-terminal conserved region (Ser(571)-Leu(700)) strongly suggests that Bacteroides species expresses a DPP with an unknown property. In conclusion, the genus Bacteroides exceptionally expresses three S46-family members; authentic DPP7, a new subtype of DPP11 with substantially reduced specificity for Glu, and a third group of S46 family members.

AB Background: Numerous documents have indicated a critical role of autophagy in alcoholic liver fibrosis (ALF), but few papers have reported its function in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation. The current study aimed to investigate the regulation effect of autophagy in HSCs activation, in further to explore the underlying mechanism involved.
   Methods: HSC-T6 cells were treated with ethanol, 3-MA (autophagy inhibitor) or rapamycin (autophagy inducer), and cells were also transfected with si-Nrf2 or si-Keap1. Moreover, ALF animal model was established and Nrf-2((-/-)), Keap1((-/-)) mice were purchased. The level of autophagy, the expression of aSMA and CoL1A1, and Nrf2 antioxidant response were evaluated in stellate cells and livers.
   Results: Ethanol treatment in cultured cells increased autophagy, oxidative stress level and promoted HSCs activation. Inhibition of autophagy reversed alcohol-induced HSCs activation and suppressed HSCs oxidative stress. Nrf2-Keap1-ARE pathway was involved in HSCs activation and oxidative stress regulated by autophagy. In addition, through in vivo study, we found that inhibition of autophagy could alleviate alcoholic fatty liver injury in ALF model mice and Nrf2 signaling was involved in autophagy regulated HSCs activation.
   Conclusion: These data implicated mechanisms underlying autophagy in regulating the fibrogenic response in HSCs activation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM). All rights reserved.

AB Micro-RNAs have been reported to play crucial roles in a diversity of cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation and development by regulating the expression of specific genes. They have also been shown to play vital roles in several diseases such as cancer. In the present study, we investigated the role of miR-143-3p in breast cancer. Our results showed that the expression of miR-143-3p is significantly downregulated in breast cancer cells. Upregulation of miR-143-3p inhibited the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Conversely, inhibition of miR-143-3p promoted the proliferation of cancer cells. Bioinformatics analysis and other several experiments revealed MAPK7 as the potential target of miR-143-3p. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the expression of MAPK7 correlated well with the expression of miR-143. Moreover, the inhibition of MAPK 7 in breast cancer cells abrogated the effects of miR-143 indicating that miR-143-3p-exerted effects on breast cancer are mediated by MAPK7. Takentogether, these results provide strong clues about the therapeutic potential of miR-143-3p in the treatment of breast cancer.

AB Background: Polyphenolic compounds isolated from pomegranate fruit possess several pharmacological activities including anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, antigenotoxic and anticoagulant activities. The present work focuses the attention on PDIA3 interaction with punicalagin and ellagic acid, the most predominant components of pomegranate extracts. PDIA3, a member of the protein disulfide isomerase family involved in several cellular functions, is associated with different human diseases and it has the potential to be a pharmacological target.
   Methods: The interaction of polyphenols with PDIA3 purified protein was explored by fluorescence quenching and calorimetric techniques and their effect on PDIA3 activity was investigated.
   Results: A higher affinity was observed for punicalagin which also strongly affects PDIA3 reductase activity in vitro as a non-competitive inhibitor. Isothermal titration calorimetry confirmed the high affinity of punicalagin for PDIA3. Considering the PDIA3 involvement in oxidative cellular stress response observed in neuroblastoma cells after treatment with hydrogen peroxide, a comparative study was conducted to evaluate the effect of punicalagin on wild type and PDIA3-silenced cells. Punicalagin increases the cell sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide in neuroblastoma cells, but this effect is drastically reduced in PDIA3-silenced cells treated in the same experimental conditions.
   Conclusions: Punicalagin binds PDIA3 and inhibits its redox activity. Comparative experiments conducted on unsilenced and PDIA3-silenced neuroblastoma cells suggest the potential of punicalagin to modulate PDIA3 reductase activity also in a biological model.

AB Plant derived small molecules, which interact with and stabilize G-quadruplex DNA, act as inhibitors of telomere elongation and oncogene expression in humans. The inhibition of telomerase enzyme has immense potential since it is over expressed in most cancer cells. Interaction of palmatine, an antitumor alkaloid, to parallel G-quadruplex DNA, [d(TTGGGGT)](4) and [d(TTAGGGT)](4), has been investigated using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), fluorescence and Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Titrations were monitored by H-1 and P-31 NMR spectra and solution structure of palmatine-[d(TTGGGGT)](4) complex was obtained by restrained Molecular Dynamics (rMD) simulations using distance restraints from 2D NOESY spectra. Thermal stabilization of DNA was determined by CD, H-1 NMR and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Binding of palmatine induces 98% enhancement of fluorescence accompanied by blue shift similar to 8 nm. CD spectral bands of DNA show minor changes. Diffusion NMR studies confirm formation of a stable complex. Proton NMR signals of palmatine shift upfield upon binding and NOE cross peaks of H10, H3, H28, 5OCH(3) protons with T2, A3/G3, G6 and T7 residues reveal dual recognition sites in both G-quadruplex DNA sequences, resulting in thermal stabilization of G-quadruplex by similar to 13-17 degrees C. Restrained molecular dynamics simulations using NOE distance restraints for 2:1 palmatine-[d(TTGGGGT)](4) complex reveal end-stacking of palmatine at G6pT7 step and groove binding along T2pG3 step. Binding to [d(TTAGGGT)](4) takes place at T2pA3pG4 and G6pT7 steps. Structural features of molecular recognition of two different G-quadruplex DNA sequences by palmatine have relevance in rational drug development for anti-cancer therapy.

AB The hybridization of two complementary ssDNA is essential for molecular biology and biological physics. T7 ssDNA binding protein (gp2.5) can rapidly facilitate this hybridization, but the mechanism and kinetic process remain unknown. As determined by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and rapid kinetic analysis methods, gp2.5 binding coiling ssDNA to form gp2.5-ssDNA complex is the rate-limiting step for the entire DNA hybridization process. Afterward, the hybridization initiates from either the terminus or the internal part of ssDNA at a nucleation rate of 0.45 s(-1). The remaining DNA strands are hybridized in a zippering mode at a rate of 0.07 s(-1), limited by the dissociation of gp2.5 from ssDNA. The gp2.5-faciliated hybridization rate constant (74 mu M(-1)s(-1)) is much higher than the spontaneous hybridization rate (1.7 mu M(-1)s(-1)) in the absence of gp2.5. These hybridization mechanism and kinetic process are different from those by other ssDNA binding proteins, such as T4 gp32, Escherichia coli SSB protein and recA protein. Compare with E. coli SSB, the relatively slower association of gp2.5 to ssDNA and faster dissociation of gp2.5 from ssDNA are probably the major reasons to facilitate the rapid hybridization. This study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanism of the recombination and repair processes and proposes a basis for improvement in their associated biotechnologies.

AB Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) decode genetic information by coupling tRNAs with cognate amino acids. In the archaeon Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus arginyl-and seryl-tRNA synthetase (ArgRS and SerRS, respectively) form a complex which enhances serylation and facilitates tRNA(Ser) recycling through its association with the ribosome. Yet, the way by which complex formation participates in Arg-tRNA(Arg) synthesis is still unresolved. Here we utilized pull down and surface plasmon resonance experiments with truncated ArgRS variants to demonstrate that ArgRS uses its N-terminal domain to establish analogous interactions with both SerRS and cognate tRNA(Arg), providing a rationale for the lack of detectable SerRS.[ArgRS.tRNA(Arg)] complex. In contrast, stable ternary ArgRS.[SerRS.tRNA(Ser)] complex was easily detected supporting the model wherein ArgRS operates in serylation by modulating SerRS affinity toward tRNASer. We also found that the interaction with SerRS suppresses arginylation of unmodified tRNA(Arg) by ArgRS, which, by itself, does not discriminate against tRNAArg substrates lacking posttranscriptional modifications. Hence, there is a fundamentally different participation of the protein partners in Arg-tRNA and Ser-tRNA synthesis. Propensity of the ArgRS.SerRS complex to exclude unmodified tRNAs from translation leads to an attractive hypothesis that SerRS.ArgRS complex might act in vivo as a safeguarding switch that improves translation accuracy.

AB L-Ascorbate (L-Asc), but not D-isoascorbate (D-Asc) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) suppress HIF1 ODD-luc reporter activation induced by various inhibitors of HIF prolyl hydroxylase (PHD). The efficiency of suppression by L-Asc was sensitive to the nature of HIF PHD inhibitor chosen for reporter activation. In particular, the inhibitors developed to compete with alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha KG), were less sensitive to suppression by the physiological range of L-Asc (40-100 mu M) than those having a strong iron chelation motif. Challenging those HIF activators in the reporter system with D-Asc demonstrated that the D-isomer, despite exhibiting the same reducing potency with respect to ferric iron, had almost no effect compared to L-Asc. Similarly, no effect on reporter activation was observed with cell-permeable reducing agent NAC up to 1 mM. Docking of L-Asc and D-Asc acid into the HIF PHD2 crystal structure showed interference of Tyr310 with respect to D-Asc. This suggests that L-Asc is not merely a reducing agent preventing enzyme inactivation. Rather, the overall results identify L-Asc as a co-substrate of HIF PHD that may compete for the binding site of aKG in the enzyme active center. This conclusion is in agreement with the results obtained recently in cell-based systems for TET enzymes and jumonji histone demethylases, where L-Asc has been proposed to act as a co-substrate and not as a reducing agent preventing enzyme inactivation.

AB In the spatial structure of tyrosine phenol-lyase, the Ser51 residue is located in the active site of the enzyme. The replacement of Ser51 with Ala by site-directed mutagenesis led to a decrease of the k(cat)/K-m parameter for reactions with L-tyrosine and 3-fluoro-L-tyrosine by three orders of magnitude, compared to wild type enzyme. For the elimination reactions of S-alkylcysteines, the values of k(cat)/K-m decreased by an average of two orders of magnitude. The results of spectral studies of the mutant enzyme gave evidence for a considerable change of the chiral properties of the active site as a result of the replacement. Fast kinetic studies for the complexes of the mutant form with competitive inhibitors allowed us to conclude that the Ser51 residue interacts with the side chain amino group of Lys257 at the stage of C-alpha-proton abstraction. This interaction ensures the correct orientation of the side chain of Lys257 accepting the C-alpha-proton of the external aldimine and stabilizes its ammonium form. Also, it is probable that Ser51 takes part in formation of a chain of hydrogen bonds which is necessary to perform the transfer of the C-alpha-proton to the C-4'-position of the leaving phenol group in the reaction with the natural substrate.

AB Bacteria need to promptly respond to environmental changes. Ribonucleases (RNases) are key factors in the adaptation to new environments by enabling a rapid adjustment in RNA levels. The exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) is essential for low-temperature cell survival, affects the synthesis of proteins involved in virulence and has an important role in swimming, cell adhesion/invasion ability, and chick colonization in C. jejuni. However, the mechanism of action of this ribonuclease is not yet known. In this work we have characterized the biochemical activity of C. jejuni PNPase. Our results demonstrate that Cj-PNP is a processive 30 to 50 exoribonuclease that degrades single-stranded RNAs. Its activity is regulated according to the temperature and divalent ions. We have also shown that the KH and S1 domains are important for trimerization, RNA binding, and, consequently, for the activity of Cj-PNP. These findings will be helpful to develop new strategies for fighting against C. jejuni and may be extrapolated to other foodborne pathogens.

AB Sodium thiosulfate (STS) has shown promising effects in amelioration of myocardial ischemiareperfusion injury (IR) in a rat model and is clinically useful in the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated calciphylaxis. As the prevalence of cardiac complications is higher in CKD, we tested the effectiveness of STS in a rat model of adenine-induced vascular calcification and subjected the heart to IR. We observed an increased infarct size (29%) by TTC staining, lactate dehydrogenase (54%) and creatine kinase (32%) release in the coronary perfusate and altered hemodynamics compared to a normal rat treated with STS and subjected to IR. As functional mitochondria are essential for preserving heart from the detrimental effects of IR, we found that calcification induced mitochondrial dysfunction (reduced RCR->80%, P/O ratio->30%, Delta Psi->10% and swelling-27%), could not be restored efficiently by STS treatment. Therefore we used nicorandil (mitochondrial potassium channel opener) along with STS as a combination therapy to treat the diseased heart and found an improvement in cardioprotection against IR injury, compared to STS alone. Upon evaluating these hearts, we found that both the cardiac mitochondria namely interfibrillar and subsarcolemmal were functionally well preserved.

AB For many years, glycine betaine (GB) has been widely studied as an osmolyte in plants and bacteria. In animal cells, GB is an osmolyte mainly in the kidneys, but in humans many studies have shown its role as a methyl donor in homocysteine metabolism in the liver. GB is also a protein stabilizer, and thus, it became known as an osmoprotector. In many organisms GB is synthesized from choline and can also be obtained from some foods. Over the last twenty years GB has gone from being considered simply as an osmolyte to being known as a cytoprotector involved in cell metabolism and as a chemical chaperone. The aim of this review was to gather information about the role of GB in the metabolism of ethanol, lipids, carbohydrates and proteins in animals. The information generated thus far shows that GB regulates enzymes involved in the homocysteine/methionine cycle, sucrose, glucose, fructose and glycogen metabolism, in oxidative and ER-stress caused by ethanol abuse, likewise enzymes involved in lipogenesis and fatty oxidation. Besides, there are data supporting that GB regulates the transcription factors PPARa, NF-kappa B, FOX1, ChREBP and SREBP1 and this lets GB play a role in protein synthesis. One of the main mechanisms by which GB regulates the enzymes is by changes in their activity either because GB increases their expression or because it regulates changes in their phosphorylation status through specific kinases. GB modulates the expression of genes by changing the degree of methylation in the promoter of target genes. The exact mechanism by which GB modifies the methylation status of the promoter is not yet clear, but methyl transferases that use SAM as methyl donor and DNA methyl transferases are good candidates for this function.

AB Leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease caused by unicellular eukaryotic protozoa of the genus Leishmania, affects more than 12 million people worldwide. Events of leishmaniasis are based on the infection of the mammalian host, precisely macrophages, where both host and parasite derived proteases and endogenous inhibitors are significant. Pathogen derived protease inhibitors have generated considerable interest as they often act as an agent promoting infection and parasitic survivability. An endogenous serine protease inhibitor from Indian strain of Leishmania donovani was previously identified by our group and named as LdISP. It has been found to inhibit neutrophil elastase (NE), responsible for natural inflammation process. However, LdISP's role in progression of infection or the proteomics based structural exposition has not been explored. The present study is aimed to localize and validate the potential role of LdISP in infectivity. We found that LdISP localized endogenously and treatment of infected host cells with LdISP curbs ROS and NO production. Additionally, in silico studies are carried out to predict the putative amino acid residues of LdISP involved in the inhibition process. Taken together, our results demonstrate that LdISP eventually exerts a pronounced role in L. donovani infection.

AB The three-finger toxins (3FTxs) represent an extremely diverse protein family in elapid venoms, where the short chain alpha-neurotoxins are the most relevant toxin group from the clinical point of view. Essentially, the 3FTxs variability and the low proportions of alpha-neurotoxins in the venoms of North American coral snakes make it difficult to obtain effective elapid antivenoms against the envenomation symptoms caused mainly by these alpha-neurotoxins. In this work, thirty 3FTx transcript sequences were obtained from the venom glands of four coral snake species from Mexico (M. diastema, M. laticollaris, M. browni and M. tener). The transcripts were mined using a forward oligonucleotide based on the highly conserved signal peptide from the 3FTxs, and four of these transcripts, named MlatA1, B.D, B.E and D.H, encoded for short-chain alpha-neurotoxins. Additionally, one isoform of the D.H alpha-neurotoxin transcript was identified in the venom of M. diastema. The mature alpha-neurotoxin coded in the D.H transcript was heterologously expressed, and it was found soluble (4.2 mg/l) in the cytoplasm of a bacterial system. The recombinant D.H (rD.H) had an IC50 value of 31.5 +/- 4.4 nM on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of the muscular type expressed in rhabdomyosarcoma cells (TE671). The rDH also had an LD50 of 0.15 mg/kg mice, and it was evaluated as a potential immunogen in New Zealand rabbits. The protective capacity of rabbit sera was tested against two native coral snake alpha-neurotoxins, and against rD.H. One of the anti-rD.H rabbit sera was able to neutralize the lethality of all three neurotoxins when tested in groups of CD1 mice. This work contributes to the increasing understanding of the high diversity of 3FTxs, and shows that recombinant coral snake alpha-neurotoxins are promising supplements for hyperimmunization protocols for coral snake antivenom production.

AB gamma-secretase is an intra-membrane aspartyl protease involved in the production of amyloid-beta peptides. Aberrant cleavage of the 99-residue C-terminal fragment of the amyloid precursor protein leads to the formation of a 42-amino-acid isoform (A beta 42). Further oligomerization and aggregation of this isoform is implicated in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Recent elucidation of gamma-secretase by cryoelectron microscopy techniques have opened a new horizon in the structural and dynamic characterization of the enzyme. Currently, only a few molecular dynamics studies have been carried out to explore the mechanism of substrate recognition and entry, or the transition between active and inactive states of the catalytic subunit. Herein, we briefly review the computational approaches and their most relevant findings. The general picture of the current GS simulation studies will open new questions to understand the behavior of the enzyme dynamics and explain the modulation mechanisms for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

AB Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is marked by hepatic fat accumulation and reflects a spectrum of chronic liver diseases associated with obesity, impaired insulin sensitivity and dyslipidemia.
   Apolipoprotein O (ApoO) is a new member of the plasma apolipoprotein family that may play a role in lipid metabolism and electron transport activity of the mitochondrium. However, its physiological functions have not been elucidated yet. Based on our previous data in a non-mammalian experimental system [1], we hypothesized that hepatic expression of ApoO is tightly linked not only to diet-induced hepatosteatosis, but also to increased lipoprotein-production induced by, e.g., hormones and oxidative stress.
   To gain insight into a mammalian experimental system, we compared the effects of lipid loading on ApoO regulation in chicken hepatoma LMH cells with those in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. Incubation of the cells with BSA-complexed oleic acid (OA-Alb) induced triglyceride accumulation, but did not affect cell viability. qPCR using specific primer pairs and Western blot analysis with in-house produced rabbit anti-ApoO antisera demonstrated significant increase in ApoO transcript and protein levels in both cell lines. ROS formation due to OA-Alb treatment was only slightly altered in LMH cells, indicating an intact antioxidant defense system of the cells.
   Oxidative stress applied by addition of H2O2 revealed induction of ApoO transcript and protein level in the same or even higher extent as monitored in the presence of OA-Alb. Upon treatment with estrogen for 24 h quantitative analysis of ApoO transcript and protein revealed increases of ApoO expression supporting the assumption that estrogen affects lipoprotein metabolism at various points. Furthermore, both cell lines showed a significant decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential upon incubation with OA-Alb. Therefore, we assume that our findings support a role of ApoO as an effector of compromised mitochondrial function that likely accompanies the onset of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

AB With the increase of multidrug resistance, novel anti-leukemia agents with diverse mechanisms of action are required to address this challenge. NK-18, the core region of mammalian derived protein NK-lysin, effectively inhibited the viability of both multidrug resistant and sensitive leukemia cell lines. Meanwhile, this proliferation inhibition effect was not distinct between sensitive and multidrug resistant leukemia cell line. NK-18 showed selectivity between non-tumorigenic and tumorigenic cells. It preferentially bound to tumor cells whose outer leaflet with high phosphatidylserine content. NK-18 acted on the multidrug resistant leukemia cell line by a rapid pore formation on the cell membrane, it is not easy for K562/ADM cells developing resistance against NK-18. Furthermore, NK-18 could neutralize lipopolysaccharides by electrostatic attraction and reduce NO production. These research data demonstrated NK-18 possesses great advantage in the multidrug resistant leukemia treatment compared with conventional chemotherapies and it could be a potential candidate for further research.

AB Carbohydrate metabolism and the antioxidant defence system of heart and muscle of the Antarctic notothenioids Notothenia rossii and Notothenia coriiceps were evaluated in response to heat stress (8 degrees C) over 144 h. N. rossii heart exhibited decreased glycolysis and aerobic metabolism after up to 12 h of exposure to 8 degrees C, and anaerobiosis was inhibited within 24 h. However, these pathways were stimulated after 72 h at 8 degrees C. The consumption of glucose-6-phosphate, derived from hexokinase (HK), by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) decreased in N. rossii heart within 6 h at 8 degrees C, with a subsequent increase at 72 h. In N. rossii muscle at 8 degrees C, glycolysis was stimulated within 2 h by an increase in pyruvate kinase (PK), and aerobic metabolism was stimulated at 144 h, together with anaerobiosis. In N. coriiceps heart at 8 degrees C, glucose break down by HK decreased within 2 h and subsequently increased at 12 and 24 h. Increased glucose-6-phosphate consumption by G6PDH occurred within 6 h at 8 degrees C. In N. coriiceps muscle at 8 degrees C, glycolysis was stimulated at 2 and 6 h, with subsequent inhibition within 24 h, as indicated by HK activity. Aerobic metabolism was inhibited at 72 and 144 h at 8 degrees C through the inhibition of citrate synthase (CS). Heat stress caused responses were only occasional and transient in antioxidant defence system of both species in the heart and muscle, leading to increased glutathione (GSH) and decreased levels of lipoperoxidation in the heart of both species. The results obtained in this study in the heart and muscles indicate that under heat stress at 8 degrees C, N. rossii is more responsive than N. coriiceps with respect to carbohydrate metabolism.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been closely associated with the proliferation, invasion and migration of various cancers, including gallbladder carcinoma (GBC). Previous studies have revealed dysregulation of miR-30b and miR-340 in many types of cancer. However, the role of miR-30b and miR-340 in the development and progression of GBC remains unclear. Moreover, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been gradually viewed as a significant contributor to tumor metastasis. In this study, the cell line GBC-SD was used and we explored that EMT promoted GBC cells invasion and migration and inhibited the expression level of miR-30b and miR-340 compared with the control. We showed that overexpression of miR-30b and miR-340 suppressed GBC cells proliferation, invasion and migration, as well as the expression of EMT-associated genes. In addition, we identified ecto-5'-nucleotidase (NT5E) as a common target of miR-30b and miR-340 using bioinformatics analysis and a luciferase assay. Further experiments found that exogenous expression of NT5E in GBC cells could partially reverse the inhibitory effect of miR-30b and miR-340 on cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Our findings suggest that NT5E-targeting miRNAs (miR-30b and miR-340) function as tumor suppressors and may represent promising therapeutic targets for GBC.

AB Insulin resistance (IR) has become a major threat to public health due to its role in metabolic syndrome. Inflammation associated with IR is an interesting area of biomedical research in recent years and is expected to affect insulin signalling pathway via downregulating glucose transporters. In the present study, we evaluate the potential of punicic acid (PA), a nutraceutical found in pomegranate seed oil, against TNF-alpha induced alteration in 3T3-L1 adipocytes on glucose metabolism, endocrine function and inflammation. IR was induced in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by treating with TNF-alpha (10 ng/mL) and various concentrations of PA (5, 10, 30 mu M) were incubated simultaneously. After 24 h, we found that TNF-alpha treatment increased mRNA expression of SOCS3, PTP1B and a decrease in IRS1 causing diminished glucose uptake. Further, it showed significantly increased transcriptional activity of NF kappa B and leptin secretion while PA maintained leptin levels normal. Additionally, PA prevented the over-expression of phosphorylated JNK in a dose dependent manner during IR. PA also ameliorated significantly the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. From the results, we conclude that PA is effective to ameliorate TNF- alpha induced IR and also we recommend the intake of PA for control and management of IR and its associated complications.

AB Browning of white adipocytes (beiging) is an attractive therapeutic strategy against obesity and its associated metabolic complications. Nobiletin (NOB) is a polymethoxylated flavone present in citrus fruits and has been reported to have anti-obesity effects. Here, we report that nobiletin exerts dual modulatory effects on adipocytes via induction of browning in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes and amelioration of stress in adipocytes. Nobiletin-induced beiging was investigated by determining expression levels of beige-specific genes and proteins by RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis, respectively. Nobiletin treatment rapidly elevated the expression levels of beige-specific genes such as Cd137, Cidea, Tbx1, and Tmem26. Further, nobiletin enhanced expression of the key transcription factors C/EBP beta, PPAR delta, and PPAR alpha, which are responsible for remodeling of white adipocytes. Nobiletin also strikingly activated HIB1B brown adipocytes and induced mitochondrial biogenesis in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes. In addition, nobiletin altered the expression of several lipid metabolism-related proteins such as ACOX1, CPT1, FAS, p-PLIN, SREBP and SIRT1. Moreover, nobiletin ameliorated stress in adipocytes by inhibiting expression levels of key stress molecules such as JNK and c-JUN. Nobiletin-induced browning could be mediated by tight regulation of kinases, as nobiletin induced PKA and p-AMPK at the protein expression level, and inhibition of PKA and p-AMPK by H-89 and dorsomorphin, respectively, abolished expression of the thermogenic markers PGC-1 alpha and UCP1. Taken together, our findings suggest that nobiletin plays a modulatory role in adipocytes via induction of browning in 3T3-L1 white adipocytes and activation of HIB1B brown adipocytes combined with amelioration of stress in adipocytes, thereby exhibiting therapeutic potential against obesity.

AB Deoxynucleoside 5-monophosphate N-glycosidase or DNPH1 (former name Rcl) is a nucleotide hydrolase whose expression in mammalian cancer tissues has been associated with its tumorigenic potential. Therefore, the enzyme has been studied principally in rat and human models. We found the corresponding gene also in the freshwater sponge Ephydatia muelleri, an animal phylogenetically very distant from mammals. Here we report the expression and characterization of the recombinant DNPH1 from E. muelleri. The ancient homolog of mammalian enzyme in a sponge showed the substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency similar to that in higher animals. E. muelleri DNPH1 is inhibited by the purine nucleotides with different numbers of 50-phosphate groups (n = 1-4). Our results demonstrate that GTP but also dGTP are the best inhibitors, followed by all other purine nucleotides that were tested. Hence, the functioning of DNPH1 in cells where the natural ATP and GTP concentrations are much higher than those of the substrates, dNMPs, should normally be downregulated. We demonstrate for the first time the existence of biologically relevant natural inhibitors of DNPH1, namely ATP and GTP.

AB The enzyme T4 endonuclease VII is a resolvase that acts on branched DNA intermediates during genetic recombination, by cleaving DNA with staggered cuts approximately 3-6 bp apart. In this paper, we investigated the sequence preference of this cleavage reaction utilising two different DNA sequences. For the first time, the DNA sequence preference of T4 endonuclease VII cleavage sites has been examined without the presence of a known DNA substrate to mask any inherent nucleotide preference. The use of the ABI3730 platform enables the cleavage site to be determined at nucleotide resolution. We found that T4 endonuclease VII cleaves DNA with a sequence preference. We calculated the frequency of nucleotides surrounding the cleavage sites and found that following nucleotides had the highest incidence: AWTAN*STC, where N* indicates the cleavage site between positions 0 and 1, N is any base, W is A or T, and S is G or C. An A at position -1 and T at position +2 were the most predominant nucleotides at the cleavage site. Using a Sequence Logo method, the sequence TATTAN*CT was derived at the cleavage site. Note that A and T nucleotides were highly preferred 5' to the cleavage sites in both methods of analysis. It was proposed that the enzyme recognises the narrower minor groove of these consecutive AT base pairs and cleaves DNA 3' to this feature. Crown Copyright (c) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The N-terminal tails of histone proteins are massively decorated with post-translational modifications (PTMs), which play important roles in the regulation of gene expression. Several highly conserved chromatin interacting proteins can bind to histone modifications in a sequence and modification specific manner employing specific reading domains. These proteins often contain several reading domains, which can cooperate in the readout of different PTMs. To gain a better insight into the combinatorial readout of PTMs, we developed a method to study the binding of double reading domains to mixed peptide arrays containing two different peptides in each spot. For that, differently modified and unmodified peptides were prepared by SPOT synthesis and solubilized. Then, two peptides were mixed and spotted onto a glass slide creating peptide spots presenting two modifications on two different peptides. Different combinations of mixed spots containing modified and unmodified peptides were generated and incubated with recombinant double reading domains to study their synergistic binding. For validation of the method, we used the well-studied BPTF subunit of the NURF chromatin-remodeling complex. BPTF contains a plant homeodomain finger (PHD) and a Bromodomain recognizing H3K4me3 and H4K16ac, respectively. We first confirmed with peptide arrays and Fluorescence Anisotropy (FA) measurements that the BPTF PHD-Bromo (PB) domain interacts specifically with the expected modifications. Using our novel tool, we observed a strong and synergistic binding only to peptide spots containing both modifications, which was lost if one of the domains was inactivated by a mutation. These data indicate that BPTF-PB simultaneously interacts with both target modifications using its PHD and Bromodomain. In agreement with the synergistic peptide interaction on mixed peptide arrays, we also show that chromatin pulldown by BPTF-PB depends on the activity of both reading domains. We conclude that mixed peptide spot arrays are a powerful, cheap and novel method for screening the combinatorial interaction space of multidomain reading proteins. Using this approach hundreds of mixed peptide spots can be prepared and tested for binding in principle allowing for an unbiased medium throughput investigation.

AB DNAzymes have been widely used in biosensors, asymmetric synthesis and pharmaceuticals. Typically, metal cofactor and substrate interact with DNA by supramolecular interactions in DNAzyme based asymmetric catalysis. However, binding positions of cofactor and substrate with DNA scaffold are not well understood, which is an obstacle to reveal the assembly and catalysis mechanisms of DNAzyme. Herein, we report a method of site-specific fluorescence quenching titration to elucidate the assembly and catalysis processes of a G-quadruplex based Diels-Alderase DNAzyme. Titration data indicate that cofactor Cu(II)-terpyridine stacked atop 5' and 3' external G-quartets with high and low binding affinities respectively, and induced the G-quadruplex to form a hybrid-1 topology. Substrate azachalcone interacted with 3' quartet exclusively, implicating that asymmetric Diels-Alder cycloaddition may occur at 3' G-quartet. In addition, enzyme kinetic analyses show that activity and enantioselectivity of the DNAzyme were substantially preserved after attaching the fluorophores. Overall, site-specific fluorescence quenching is a concise and efficient approach to probe the assembly processes of DNAzyme.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 on the apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. The effects of 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 on the proliferation and apoptosis of human HCC cells by regulating histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) were assessed by MTT assay and flow cytometry. The effects of 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 on the expressions of related proteins in the apoptosis pathway by regulating HDAC2 as well as the mechanism were studied by Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR. A nude mouse model of HCC xenograft was established. A control group, a 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 treatment group, a 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 + HDAC2 overexpression group, an HDAC2 interference group and an HDAC2 overexpression group were set. The tumor volume was recorded, and histopathological changes were observed by HE staining. 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells and induced their apoptosis. Overexpression of HDAC2 attenuated the inhibitory effects of 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 on the proliferation of HepG2 cells and its ability to induce apoptosis. In the 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 + HDAC2 overexpression group, the expressions of p53, Bax, DR5 and caspase 8 were significantly lower but the expression of Bcl-2 was significantly higher than those of the 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 treatment group (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 treatment and HDAC2 interference groups had significantly decreased tumor volumes and promoted apoptosis of HCC cells in tumor tissues. Overexpression of HDAC2 weakened the inhibitory effects of 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 on tumor volume and its ability to induce apoptosis in tissues. A large area of tumor cells underwent necrosis in 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 treatment and HDAC2 interference groups. In the 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 + HDAC2 overexpression group, both the area of necrosis and cell volume decreased. In conclusion, 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells and induced their apoptosis by downregulating the expression of HDAC2, up-regulating p53, and regulating its downstream mitochondriamediated pathway and the exogenous DR-mediated pathway.

AB 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 (1,23(OH)(2) D-3) is known to play a dual role in cancer, by promoting or inhibiting carcinogenesis via 1,23(OH)(2) D-3 receptor (VDR) and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN). Fok I polymorphism of VDR may indirectly influence the receptor levels through autoregulation. The involvement of neutral sphingomyelinase in the non-classic VDR-mediated genomic pathway response to 1,23(OH)(2) D-3 treatment has been reported. Until now no information were reported about Fok I polymorphism of VDR in NCI-N87 human gastric cancer cells and the relation between acid sphingomyelinase and 1,23(OH)(2) D-3. Herein, we showed that NCI-N87 human gastric cancer cells are homozygous for the Fok I 'C' allele; resulting in a three amino acid-truncated protein form of the VDR. Surprisingly 1,23(OH)(2) D-3 treatments strongly down-regulated the expression of VDR whereas acid sphingomyelinase and PTEN expression were upregulated. No changes of neutral sphingomyelinase expression were observed after 1,23(OH)(2) D-3 treatment, whereas acid sphingomyelinase activity increased. Furthermore 1,23(OH)(2) D-3 induced over-expression of caspase 8, CDKN2B, MAP3K5, cytochrome C apoptotic genes. Morphological analysis highlighted some very large round or oval cells and small cells with angular or fusiform extensions, confirmed by MIB-1 immunodetection and Hercep test.
   Taken together our results indicated that the action of 1,23(OH)(2) D-3 in gastric cancer cells was independent on 1,23(OH)(2) D-3 receptor and suggested the acid sphingomyelinase as a possible target to induce molecular events. (c) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Replication protein A (RPA) is a single-stranded DNA binding protein involved in replication and in telomere maintenance. During telomere replication, G-quadruplexes (G4) can accumulate on the lagging strand template and need to be resolved. It has been shown that human RPA is able to unfold a single G4. Nevertheless, the G-strand of human telomeres is prone to fold into higher-order structures formed by contiguous G-quadruplexes. To understand how RPA deals with these structures, we studied its interaction with telomeric G-strands folding into an increasing number of contiguous G4s. The aim of this study was to determine whether the efficiency of binding/unfolding of hRPA to telomeric G-strands depends on the number of G4 units. Our data show that the number n of contiguous G4 units (n >= 2) does not affect the efficiency of hRPA to coat transiently exposed single-stranded telomeric G-strands. This feature may be essential in preventing instability due to G4 structures during telomere replication. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB Neprilysin is also known as skin fibroblast-derived elastase, and its up-regulation during aging is associated with impairments of the elastic fiber network, loss of skin elasticity and wrinkle formation. However, information on its elastase activity is still limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the degradation of fibrillar skin elastin by neprilysin and the influence of the donor's age on the degradation process using mass spectrometry and bioinformatics approaches. The results showed that cleavage by neprilysin is dependent on previous damage of elastin. While neprilysin does not cleave young and intact skin elastin well, it degrades elastin fibers from older donors, which may further promote aging processes. With regards to the cleavage behavior of neprilysin, a strong preference for Gly at P1 was found, while Gly, Ala and Val were well accepted at P1' upon cleavage of tropoelastin and skin elastin. The results of the study indicate that the progressive release of bioactive elastin peptides by neprilysin upon skin aging may enhance local tissue damage and accelerate extracellular matrix aging processes.

AB MLH1 and PMS2 proteins form the MutLa heterodimer, which plays a major role in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in humans. Mutations in MMR-related proteins are associated with cancer, especially with colon cancer. The N-terminal region of MutLa comprises the N-termini of PMS2 and MLH1 and, similarly, the C-terminal region of MutLa is composed by the C-termini of PMS2 and MLH1, and the two are connected by linker region. The nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) necessary for the nuclear transport of the two proteins are found in this linker region. However, the exact NLS sequences have been controversial, with different sequences reported, particularly for MLH1. The individual components are not imported efficiently, presumably due to their C-termini masking their NLSs. In order to gain insights into the nuclear transport of these proteins, we solved the crystal structures of importin-alpha bound to peptides corresponding to the supposed NLSs of MLH1 and PMS2 and performed isothermal titration calorimetry to study their binding affinities. Both putative MLH1 and PMS2 NLSs can bind to importin-alpha as monopartite NLSs, which is in agreement with some previous studies. However, MLH1-NLS has the highest affinity measured by a natural NLS peptide, suggesting a major role of MLH1 protein in nuclear import compared to PMS2. Finally, the role of MLH1 and PMS2 in the nuclear transport of the MutLa heterodimer is discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB Recently, we have demonstrated that toluidine blue O (TBO), a phenothiazine dye, shows inhibitory effects on both cholinesterases and amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) cellular model. In the present study, we aimed to determine the effects of TBO (in a purity of 85%) on amyloid and tau pathologies in a triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD). Beginning at 7.5 (mild pathology) or 13 (severe pathology) months of age, 3xTg-AD mice were treated intraperitoneally with 4mg/kg TBO or vehicle daily for 30 days. TBO treatment significantly reduced the levels of insoluble A beta 40 and A beta 42 in the hippocampi of mild and severe pathology groups compared to vehicle-treated counterparts. When the levels of full-length amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) were assessed in 3xTg-AD mice at late pathological stage, no significant changes were observed after TBO treatment. Similarly, TBO did not recover hyperphosphorylation of tau at residues Thr181 and Ser202/Thr205 significantly in soluble and insoluble hippocampal fractions of 3xTg-AD mice. Taken together, the current study is the first in vivo report, to our knowledge, demonstrating that TBO mitigates amyloid pathology in 3xTg-AD mice with no apparent change on tau phosphorylation. Overall, the preliminary data presented here support the possible use of TBO as a disease-modifying drug for AD treatment.

AB Leishmaniasis is a parasitic reticuloendotheliosis whose pathogen is a zooflagellate belonging to the genus Leishmania transmitted by the bite of an infected phlebotome. Recently, a unique secretory lipase from the human pathogen Leishmania donovani Ldlip3 has been identified and characterized. This lipase has a high identity with a putative triacylglycerol lipase of Leishmania major (Lmlip2). In the present study, Lmlip2 was expressed in the eukaryotic heterologous expression system Pichia pastoris as tagged enzyme of 308 amino acids. Maximal protein production was reached after 2 days of fermentation. Optimal Lmlip2 lipase activity was measured using the pH stat technique at pH 8 at 26 degrees C using vinyl esters and triacylglycerols (true lipids) as substrates. Moreover, biochemical characterization of Lmlip2 contained in culture supernatant, illustrates that L. major secreted lipase is active and stable at low temperatures especially 26 degrees and prefer neutral pH; concerning substrate specificityLmlip2 presents a preference for short chains lipid substrates vinyl esters such as VC2, VC3 and VC4 likewise, it is capable to hydrolyze long chain triacylglycerols like olive oil. Metal ions and surfactants tested in this study decrease Lmlip2 activity. Further studies are needed to clarify the relation between the lipase activity and the virulence. Thus, it could lead to the identification of novel targets to block cutaneous Leishmaniasis in human hosts. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Despite its natural abundance in lenses of vertebrates the physiological function(s) of the galectin-related inter-fiber protein (GRIFIN) is (are) still unclear. The same holds true for the significance of the unique interspecies (fish/birds vs mammals) variability in the capacity to bind lactose. In solution, ultracentrifugation and small angle X-ray scattering (at concentrations up to 9 mg/mL) characterize the protein as compact and stable homodimer without evidence for aggregation. The crystal structure of chicken (C-)GRIFIN at seven pH values from 4.2 to 8.5 is reported, revealing compelling stability. Binding of lactose despite the Arg71Val deviation from the sequence signature of galectins matched the otherwise canonical contact pattern with thermodynamics of an enthalpically driven process. Upon lactose accommodation, the side chain of Arg50 is shifted for hydrogen bonding to the 3-hydroxyl of glucose. No evidence for a further ligand-dependent structural alteration was obtained in solution by measuring hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometrically in peptic fingerprints. The introduction of the Asn48Lys mutation, characteristic for mammalian GRIFINs that have lost lectin activity, lets labeled C-GRIFIN maintain capacity to stain tissue sections. Binding is no longer inhibitable by lactose, as seen for the wild-type protein. These results establish the basis for detailed structure-activity considerations and are a step to complete the structural description of all seven members of the galectin network in chicken.

ID MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; PROTEINS; MODEL; PH
AB The structural dynamics of membrane permeabilization are investigated systematically and compared between viral fusion peptides (VFPs) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). It is revealed that the permeabilization process can be divided into two phases: a fast motion phase in water (first phase) and a slow diffusion phase in lipid (second phase). Difference in peptide permeability to neutrally or weakly charged mammalian membrane and to negatively charged bacterial membrane is primarily determined by the first phase, which is dominated by the direct electrostatic interaction between peptide and the hydrophilic surface of membranes. With the harvested knowledge we attempt to rationally design anti-Gram-positive AMPs based on the VFP scaffold of Chikungunya virus fusion domain, which is an 18-mer polypeptide segment (VT18, (84)VYPFMWGGAYCFCDAENT(101)) located in the structural glycoprotein E1 of viral envelope. Our simulations and previous NMR study suggest that the isolated VT18 peptide can be well structured into a double-stranded beta-sheet conformation in water, but would become intrinsically disordering in lipid. Converting the negatively charged VT18 (charge = -2) to two positively charged peptides VT18-KKLV (VYPFMWGGAYCFCKAKLV-NH2) (charge = +3) and VT18-CAKKLV (VYPFCWGGAYAFCKAKLV-NH2) (charge = +3) by residue substitution and C-terminal amidation can largely promote peptide approaching to bacterial membrane surface, thus rendering the peptide with a substantially increased antibacterial activity against Gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC changes from >200 to 52-105 and 58-90 mu g/ml, respectively). A further cyclization of linear peptide VT18-CAKKLV by adding a disulfide bond across its two strand arms, which results in a cyclic peptide cVT18-CAKKLV (VYPFCWGGAYAFCKAKLV-NH2) (charge = +3), can effectively stabilize the peptide beta-sheet conformation in lipid, thus improving its membrane compatibility in second phase and enhancing its antibacterial potency (MIC = 35-67 mu g/ml). We also demonstrated that the designed AMPs have no or only a moderate cytotoxic effect and hemolytic activity on human normal cells.

AB High-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a powerful technique for the direct visualization of single molecules. Here, AFM is applied to characterize the oligomeric state of hemagglutinins of the influenza virus. Hemagglutinins are known to be present in a trimeric form inside the viral envelope. However, recombinant hemagglutinins are also present as large oligomers, which impair the functional activity of the protein. Five commercial recombinant hemagglutinins from the viral strains H1, H3, H5, H7, and H9 were studied with high-resolution AFM. Functionally inactive hemagglutinins were shown to have a higher percentage of large oligomers compared with the proteins with functional activity. Large oligomers were revealed to be unstable; the oligomeric state of hemagglutinin was affected by pH or the presence of ligands. Antibody binding shifts the balance to small oligomers, whereas DNA aptamer induced the formation of large associates.

AB Oligonucleotide-directed triple helix formation has been recognized as a potential tool for targeting genes with high specificity. Cystosine methylation in the 5, position is both ubiquitous and a stable regulatory modification, which could potentially stabilize triple helix formation. In this work, we have used a combination of calorimetric and spectroscopic techniques to study the intramolecular unfolding of four triplexes and two duplexes. We used the following triplex control sequence, named Control Tri, d(AGAGAC(5)TCTCTC(5)TCTCT), where C-5 are loops of five cytosines. From this sequence, we studied three other sequences with dC -> d(m(5)C) substitutions on the Hoogsteen strand (2MeH), Crick strand (2MeC) and both strands (4MeHC). Calorimetric studies determined that methylation does increase the thermal and enthalpic stability, leading to an overall favorable free energy, and that this increased stability is cumulative, i.e. methylation on both the Hoogsteen and Crick strands yields the largest favorable free energy. The differential uptake of protons, counterions and water was determined. It was found that methylation increases cytosine protonation by shifting the apparent pK(a) value to a higher pH; this increase in proton uptake coincides with a release of counterions during folding of the triplex, likely due to repulsion from the increased positive charge from the protonated cytosines. The immobilization of water was not affected for triplexes with methylated cytosines on their Hoogsteen or Crick strands, but was seen for the triplex where both strands are methylated. This may be due to the alignment in the major groove of the methyl groups on the cytosines with the methyl groups on the thymines which causes an increase in structural water along the spine of the triplex.

AB The full gene sequence encoding for the Trypanosoma equiperdum ortholog of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) regulatory (R) subunits was cloned. A poly-His tagged construct was generated [TeqR-like(His)(8)], and the protein was expressed in bacteria and purified to homogeneity. The size of the purified TeqR-like(His)(8) was determined to be similar to 57,000 Da by molecular exclusion chromatography indicating that the parasite protein is a monomer. Limited proteolysis with various proteases showed that the T. equiperdum R-like protein possesses a hinge region very susceptible to proteolysis. The recombinant TeqR-like(His)(8) did not bind either [H-3] cAMP or [H-3] cGMP up to concentrations of 0.40 and 0.65 mu M, respectively, and neither the parasite protein nor its proteolytically generated carboxy-terminal large fragments were capable of binding to a cAMP-Sepharose affinity column. Bioinformatics analyses predicted that the carboxy-terminal region of the trypanosomal R-like protein appears to fold similarly to the analogous region of all known PKA R subunits. However, the protein amino-terminal portion seems to be unrelated and shows homology with proteins that contained Leu-rich repeats, a folding motif that is particularly appropriate for protein-protein interactions. In addition, the three-dimensional structure of the T. equiperdum protein was modeled using the crystal structure of the bovine PKA RI a subunit as template. Molecular docking experiments predicted critical changes in the environment of the two putative nucleotide binding clefts of the parasite protein, and the resulting binding energy differences support the lack of cyclic nucleotide binding in the trypanosomal R-like protein.

AB RNA aptamers are ribonucleic acids that bind to specific target molecules. An RNA aptamer for a disease-related protein has great potential for development into a new drug. However, huge time and cost investments are required to develop an RNA aptamer into a pharmaceutical. Recently, SELEX combined with high-throughput sequencers (i.e., HT-SELEX) has been widely used to select candidate RNA aptamers that bind to a target protein with high affinity and specificity. After candidate selection, further optimizations such as shortening and modifying candidate sequences are performed. In these steps, in silico approaches are expected to reduce the time and cost associated with aptamer drug development. In this article, we review existing in silico approaches to RNA aptamer development, including a method for ranking the candidates of RNA aptamers from HT-SELEX data, clustering a huge number of aptamer sequences, and finding motifs amidst a set of significant RNA aptamers. It is expected that further studies in addition to these methods will be utilized for in silico RNA aptamer design, permitting a minimal number of experiments to be performed through the utilization of sophisticated computational methods.

AB The sensitive and specific detection of pathogenic cells is essential in clinical diagnostics. To achieve this, molecular tools are required that unequivocally recognise appropriate cell surface molecules, such as biomarkers that come along with disease onset and progression. Aptamers are short single-stranded oligonucleotides that interact with cognate target molecules with high affinity and specificity. Within the last years they have gained an increased attention as cell-recognition tools. Here, we report a systematic analysis of a cell-SELEX procedure, for the identification of aptamers that recognise breast cancer cells. Besides a comparison of conventional (Sanger) with high-throughput sequencing techniques (next-generation sequencing), three different screening techniques have been applied to characterise the binding properties of selected aptamer candidates. This method has been found to be beneficial in finding DNA aptamers, rarely enriched in the libraries. Finally, four DNA aptamers were identified that exhibit broad-spectrum interaction patterns to different cancer cell lines derived from solid tumours.

AB High affinity binders targeting specific cell surface proteins are vital for development of basic and applied biosciences. However, despite sustained efforts to generate such binders by chemicals and antibodies, there are still many cell surface proteins that lack high affinity binders. Nucleic acid aptamers have potential as binding molecules for cell surface proteins, because they form distinct structures that have high affinity and specificity for a wide range of targets. Aptamers are isolated from large combinatorial libraries using a unique iterative selection-amplification process known as systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). Among advantages of this method, purified and complex heterogeneous targets, such as bacteria, viruses, and whole-living cells, can be used for selection of aptamers. Moreover, SELEX allows generation of cell-surface-specific aptamers without prior knowledge of expression profiles in target cells. Therefore, the technology has been widely used as a valid and feasible method to generate aptamers binding to cell surface proteins with intact structure. Herein, this review summarizes and updates iconic SELEX technologies that target membrane proteins. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB We have developed a new cocaine-binding aptamer variant that has a significantly higher melt temperature when bound to a ligand than the currently used sequence. Retained in this new construct is the ligand-induced structure-switching binding mechanism that is important in biosensing applications of the cocaine-binding aptamer. Isothermal titration calorimetry methods show that the binding affinity of this new sequence is slightly tighter than the existing cocaine-binding aptamer. The improved thermal performance, a T-m increase of 4 degrees C for the cocaine-bound aptamer and 9 degrees C for the quinine-bound aptamer, was achieved by optimizing the DNA sequence in stem 2 of the aptamer to have the highest stability based on the nearest neighbor thermodynamic parameters and confirmed by UV and fluorescence spectroscopy. The sequences in stem 1 and stem 3 were unchanged in order to retain the structure switching and ligand binding functions. The more favorable thermal stability characteristics of the OR3 aptamer should make it a useful construct for sensing applications employing the cocaine-binding aptamer system.

AB About 150 participants attended the symposium organised at the Palais de la Bourse in Bordeaux, France on September 22-23, 2017. Thirty speakers from all over the world delivered lectures covering selection processes, aptamer chemistry and innovative applications of these powerful tools that display major advantages over antibodies. Beyond the remarkable science presented, lively discussion and fruitful exchange between participants made this meeting a great success. A series of lectures were focused on synthetic biology (riboswitches, new synthetic base pairs, mutated polymerases). Innovative selection procedures including functional screening of oligonucleotide pools were described. Examples of aptasensors for the detection of pathogens were reported. The potential of aptamers for the diagnostic and the treatment of diseases was also presented. Brief summaries of the lectures presented during the symposium are given in this report. The third edition of this symposium will take place in Boulder, Colorado in Summer 2018 (information available at http://www.aptamers-in-bordeaux.com/).

AB A novel aptamer generation method to greatly augment the affinity and stability of DNA aptamers was developed by genetic alphabet expansion combined with mini-hairpin DNA technology. The genetic alphabet expansion increases the physicochemical and structural diversities of DNA aptamers by introducing extra components, unnatural bases, as a fifth base, allowing for the enhancement of DNA aptamer affinities. Furthermore, the mini-hairpin DNA technology stabilizes DNA aptamers against nuclease digestion and thermal denaturation, by introducing an extraordinarily stable mini-hairpin DNA containing a GCGAAGC sequence. This novel method provides stabilized high-affinity DNA aptamers for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

AB Therapeutic molecules can be classified as low-, middle- and high-molecular weight drugs depending on their molecular masses. Antibodies represent high-molecular weight drugs and their clinical applications have been developing rapidly. Aptamers, on the other hand, are middle-molecular weight molecules that are short, single-stranded nucleic acid sequences that are selected in vitro from large oligonucleotide libraries based on their high affinity to a target molecule. Hence, aptamers can be thought of as a nucleic acid analog to antibodies. However, several viewpoints hold that the potential of aptamers arises from interesting characteristics that are distinct from, or in some cases, superior to those of antibodies. Recently, therapeutic middle molecules gain considerable attention as protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors. This review summarizes the recent achievements in aptamer development in our laboratory in terms of PPI and non-PPI inhibitors.

AB Current therapy for ovarian cancer typically involves indiscriminate chemotherapies that can have severe off target effects on healthy tissue and are still plagued by aggressive recurrence. Recent shifts towards targeted therapies offer the possibility of circumventing the obstacles experienced by these traditional treatments. While antibodies are the pioneering agents in targeted therapies, clinical experience has demonstrated that their antitumor efficacy is limited due to their high immunogenicity, large molecular size, and costly and laborious production. In contrast, nucleic acid based chemical antibodies, also known as aptamers, are ideal for this application given their small size, lack of immunogenicity and in vitro production. As aptamers have begun to demonstrate their promise through targeting Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM), as well as a number of ovarian cancer biomarkers, in in vivo and in vitro models, their clinical applicability is slowly being realised. This review explores some of the current progress of aptamers targeting cancer biomarkers and their potential role as ovarian cancer therapeutics.

AB The extraordinary boost in the understanding of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the development and progression of different types of cancer, is offering an unprecedented hope for the development of precise therapeutics able to interfere or replace the expression of target genes. In the last decade, the design of stable, safe and effective RNA-based therapeutics has been significantly improved increasing the number of molecules now in preclinical or in clinical trials for cancer gene therapy. However, with few exclusions as liver and hematological malignancies which are easy accessible to drugs, the development of effective systemic approaches for the delivery of RNA therapeutics to target cells is still unmet. To be effective, targeting carriers must be able to overcome both functional and physical barriers to safely carry and accumulate the therapeutic through the organism selectively to the tumor site, penetrate the target cancer mass, promote the uptake and localization in the appropriate intracellular compartment ultimately leading to the effective modulation of gene expression. Nucleic acid aptamers are folded single stranded oligonucleotides that bind at high affinity and high specificity their targets (proteins, lipids, small molecules etc), coupling the advantages of binding specificity proper of antibodies to the chemical nature of nucleic acids, sometimes also termed "nucleic acid antibodies". In several cases, aptamers targeting cell surface receptors are recycled into the cell together with the bound receptor enabling to drive conjugated therapeutics to cancer cells in a receptor-dependent manner. Therefore, besides other in vivo delivery strategies, the use of aptamers as precise and effective targeting moieties for anticancer RNA-based therapeutics has rapidly emerged and has been successfully addressed by several laboratories. In this Review, we will focus on the most recent and challenging progresses in the field that highlights the precision and flexibility of aptamer-based chimeras paving the way to the development of safe and effective carriers for cancer gene therapeutics.

AB The increased incidence of neurodegenerative diseases represents a huge challenge for societies. These diseases are characterized by neuronal death and include several different pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Most of these pathologies are often associated with the aggregation of misfolded proteins, such as amyloid-beta, tau, alpha-synuclein, huntingtin and prion proteins. However, the precise mechanisms that lead to neuronal dysfunction and death in these diseases remain poorly understood. Nucleic acid aptamers represent a new class of ligands that could be useful to better understand these diseases and develop better diagnosis and therapy. In this review, several of these aptamers are presented as well as their applications for neurodegenerative diseases.

AB Aptamers which bind to proteins involved in cell-cell interactions could have significant value to directly affect cancer cell adhesion or for directed cargo delivery. Here, I discuss two aptamers: aptamer SDA which binds to E- and P-selectin, and aptamer IDA which binds to alpha 6 beta 4 integrin. Both aptamers (SDA 91 nt and IDA 77 nt) bind their target proteins with dissociation constants in the 100-150 nM range and substantially inhibit special cellular adhesion, possibly a first and pivotal step in transendothelial migration during metastasis formation. The aptamers' half-lives in cell culture media are between two and six hours. IDA is internalized by integrin presenting cells within minutes thus possibly serving as vehicle for directed cargo delivery.

AB Aptamers are nucleic acids that bind to a target molecule with high affinity and specificity, which are selected from systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). Aptamers feature high affinity and specificity to their target molecule and a large structural diversity; biophysical tools, together with structural studies, are essential to reveal the mechanism of aptamers recognition. Furthermore, understanding the mechanism of action would also contribute to their development for therapeutic applications. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is a fast and robust method to study the physical basis of molecular interactions. In a single experiment, it provides all thermodynamic parameters of a molecular interaction, including dissociation constant, K-d; Gibbs free energy change, Delta G; enthalpy change, Delta H; entropy change, Delta S; and stoichiometry, N. The development of modern microcalorimeters significantly contributed to the expansion of the ITC use in biological systems. Therefore, ITC has been applied to the development of small therapeutic agents that bind to target proteins and is increasingly being used to study aptamer-target protein interactions. This review focuses on thermodynamic approaches for understanding the molecular principles of aptameretarget interactions.

Aptamers are not the only affinity ligands available but they represent an emerging and highly promising route that advantageously competes with antibodies in immunopurification processes.
   A historical background of affinity chromatography from the beginning of the discipline to the most recent outcomes is first presented. Then the focus is centered on aptamers which represent the last step so far to the long quest for affinity ligands associating very high specificity, availability and strong stability against most harsh cleaning agents required in chromatography. Then technologies of ligand selection from large libraries followed by the most appropriate chemical grafting approaches are described and supported by a number of bibliographic references.
   Experimental results assembled from relevant published paper are reported; they are selected by their practical applicability and potential use at large scale.
   The review concludes with specific remarks and future developments that are expected in the near future to turn this technology into a large acceptance for preparative applications. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Recently, several oligonucleotides have been launched for clinical use and a number of therapeutic oligonucleotides are under clinical trials. Aptamer is one of the oligonucleotide therapeutics and has received a lot of attention as a new technology and an efficacious pharmaceutical compound comparable to antibody. Aptamer could be used for various purposes, not only therapeutics but also diagnostics, and applicable to affinity chromatography as a carrier molecule to purify proteins of interest. Here we demonstrate the usage and advantages of RNA aptamer to Fc region of human IgG (i.e., IgG aptamer) for purification of human antibodies. IgG aptamer requires divalent cations for binding to IgG and bound IgG dissociates easily upon treatment with chelating reagent, such as EDTA, under neutral conditions. This elution step is very mild and advantageous for maintaining active conformations of therapeutic antibodies compared to the widely used affinity purification with Protein A/G, which requires acidic elution that often damages the active conformation of antibodies. In fact, of several monoclonal antibodies tested, three antibodies were prone to aggregate on acidic elution from the Protein A/G resin, while remained fully active upon neutral elution from the IgG aptamer resin. The IgG aptamer was fully manipulated to alkaline resistant by ribose 20-modifications, and thereby reusable numerous times with 1 N NaOH washing. The capacity of the aptamer resin to bind IgG was equivalent to that of the Protein A/G resin. Therefore, the IgG aptamer will provide us with a unique tool to uncover and purify human monoclonal antibodies, which hold therapeutic potential but lose the activity upon acidic elution from Protein A/G-based affinity resin.

AB There is a critical need for better malaria rapid diagnostic tests to discriminate Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infection given the recent observation of HRP2 deletions in P. falciparum parasites. We previously identified a DNA aptamer, 2008s, that targets P. falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (PfLDH) and developed a sensitive aptamer-tethered enzyme capture (APTEC) assay. Here, we characterise two different LDH-binding DNA aptamers in their species-specific activities, then integrate within biochemical diagnostic assays and test in clinical samples. An enzyme-linked oligonucleotide assay demonstrated that aptamer pL1 bound with high affinity to both PfLDH and P. vivax lactate dehydrogenase (PvLDH), whereas aptamer 2008s was specific to PfLDH. An aptamer-tethered enzyme capture (APTEC) assay confirmed the specificity of 2008s in binding and capturing the enzyme activity of PfLDH which could be observed colorimetrically. In malaria patient samples, the 2008s APTEC assay was specific for P. falciparum blood samples and could discriminate against P. vivax blood samples. An aptamer for specific detection of falciparum malaria holds promise as a new strategy for species-specific malaria diagnosis rather than the conventional HRP2 immuno-assay.

AB The RNA-cleaving Ag10c DNAzyme was recently isolated via in vitro selection and it can bind two Ag+ ions for activity. The Ag10c contains a well-defined Ag+ binding aptamer as indicated by DMS footprinting. Since aptamer binding is often accompanied with conformational changes, we herein used 2-aminopurine (2AP) to probe its folding in the presence of Ag+. The Ag10c was respectively labeled with 2AP at three different positions, both in the substrate strand and in the enzyme strand, one at a time. Ag+-induced folding was observed at the substrate cleavage junction and the A9 position of the enzyme strand, consistent with aptamer binding. The measured K-d at the A9 position was 18 mu M Ag+ with a Hill coefficient of 2.17, similar to those obtained from the previous cleavage activity based assays. However, labeling a 2AP at the A2 position inhibited the activity and folding. Compared to other metal ions, Ag+ has a unique sigmoidal folding profile indicative of multiple silver binding cooperatively. This suggests that Ag+ can induce a local folding in the enzyme loop and this folding is important for activity. This study provides important biophysical insights into this new DNAzyme, suggesting the possibility of designing folding-based biosensors for Ag+.

AB Rapid and accurate diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) is crucial for patient treatment, infection control and epidemiological monitoring. As an important antigen, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) has been proposed as a preliminary screening test target for CDI. However, current assays based on GDH activity or GDH immunoassays have suboptimal sensitivity and specificity. Herein, we describe the selection and characterization of single-stranded DNA aptamers that specifically target GDH. After 10 rounds of selection, high-throughput sequencing was used to identify enriched aptamer candidates. Of 10 candidates, three aptamers for GDH were identified. Gel shift assays showed that these aptamers exhibited low nanomolar affinities. One aptamer was optimized based on structural analysis and further engineered into a structure-switching fluorescence signaling aptamer, wherein desorption from reduced graphene oxide (RGO) upon binding of GDH led to an increase in fluorescence emission. This method allowed for quantitative detection of GDH with a detection limit of 1 nM, providing great potential for its further application in CDI diagnosis.

AB Antithrombin DNA aptamersRE31 are single-chain oligonucleotides that fold into three-dimensional forms allowing them to bind the enzyme with high affinity and inhibit its activity in vivo. They are rapidly degraded by a nonspecific nuclease, and, to prolong the lifetime of the aptamer DNA in the bloodstream, it is necessary to coat it with a polymer envelope. A new approach to solving this problem based on preparation of DNAepolyelectrolyte complexes with a minimal particle size that can circulate with blood flow. In our experiments, the negatively charged aptamer DNA RE31 was coated step-by-step with positively charged protamine. They had protamine/aptamer ratios of 0.2/1 and 0.4/1 by charge, with particle size being determined by dynamic light scattering. The aptamer DNAeprotamine complexes were administered to rats, followed by ex vivo analysis of blood samples. The results showed that prothrombin time (PT) increased by a factor of 5.6-6.7 within 2 h after injection and remained at approximately the same level for 6 h, while injections of pure protamine did not lead to any noticeable change in clotting time. Thus, complexation with protamine proved to prolong the inhibitory activity of the RE31 DNA aptamer. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB We selected and investigated nine G-quadruplex (G4)-forming aptamers originally designed against different proteins involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation (STAT3, nucleolin, TOP1, SP1, VEGF, and SHP-2) and considered to be potential anticancer agents. We showed that under physiological conditions all the aptamers form stable G4s of different topology. G4 aptamers designed against STAT3, nucleolin and SP1 inhibit STAT3 transcriptional activity in human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells, and all the studied aptamers inhibit TOP1-mediated relaxation of supercoiled plasmid DNA. STAT3 inhibition by G4 aptamer designed against SP1 protein provides a new explanation for the SP1 and STAT3 crosstalk described recently. We found some correlation between G4-mediated inhibition of the DNA replication and TOP1 activity. Four G4 aptamers from our dataset that appeared to be the strongest TOP1 inhibitors most efficiently decreased de novo DNA synthesis, by up to 79-87%. Seven G4 aptamers demonstrated significantly higher antiproliferative activity on human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells than on immortalized mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells. Pleiotropic properties of G4 aptamers and their high specificity against cancer cells observed for the majority of the studied G4 aptamers allowed us to present them as promising candidates for multi-targeted cancer therapy.

AB Reprogramming of cellular metabolism is now considered one of the hallmarks of cancer. Most malignant cells present with altered energy metabolism which is associated with elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This is also evident for melanoma, the leading cause of skin cancer related deaths. Altered mechanisms affecting mitochondrial bioenergetics pose attractive targets for novel anticancer therapies. Antimicrobial peptides have been shown to exhibit selective anticancer activities. In this study, the anti-melanoma potential of the antimicrobial peptide, nisin Z, was evaluated in vitro. Nisin Z was shown to induce selective toxicity in melanoma cells compared to non-malignant keratinocytes. Furthermore, nisin Z was shown to negatively affect the energy metabolism (glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration) of melanoma cells, increase reactive oxygen species generation and cause apoptosis. Results also indicate that nisin Z can decrease the invasion and proliferation of melanoma cells demonstrating its potential use against metastasis associated with melanoma. As nisin Z seems to place a considerable extra burden on the energy metabolism of melanoma cells, combination therapies with known anti-melanoma agents may be effective treatment options.

AB Proteins whose presence prevents water from freezing in living organisms at temperatures below 0 degrees C are referred to as antifreeze proteins. This group includes molecules of varying size (from 30 to over 300 aa) and variable secondary/supersecondary conformation. Some of these proteins also contain peculiar structural motifs called solenoids. We have applied the fuzzy oil drop model in the analysis of four categories of antifreeze proteins: 1 - very small proteins, i.e. helical peptides (below 40 aa); 2 - small globular proteins (40-100 aa); 3 - large globular proteins (> 100 aa) and 4 - proteins containing solenoids. The FOD model suggests a mechanism by which antifreeze proteins prevent freezing. In accordance with this theory, the presence of the protein itself produces an ordering of water molecules which counteracts the formation of ice crystals. This conclusion is supported by analysis of the ordering of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues in antifreeze proteins, revealing significant variability - from perfect adherence to the fuzzy oil drop model through structures which lack a clearly defined hydrophobic core, all the way to linear arrangement of alternating local minima and maxima propagating along the principal axis of the solenoid (much like in amyloids). The presented model - alternative with respect to the ice docking model - explains the antifreeze properties of compounds such as saccharides and fatty acids. The fuzzy oil drop model also enables differentiation between amyloids and antifreeze proteins. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Carboxylesterases (CarEs) play vital roles in metabolising different physiologically important endogenous compounds and in detoxifying various harmful exogenous compounds in insects. Multiple studies of CarEs have focused on pesticide metabolism in insects, while few studies have aimed to identify CarE functions in oxidative resistance, particularly in Apis cerana cerana. In this study, we isolated a carboxylesterase gene, esterase FE4, from Apis cerana cerana and designated it towards an exploration of its roles as an antioxidant and in detoxification. We investigated AcceFE4 expression patterns in response to various stressors. A quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that AcceFE4 was up-regulated by H2O2, imidacloprid, and paraquat, and was down-regulated by 4 degrees C, UV radiation, CdCl2, and HgCl2. Additionally, the protein expression of this gene was down-regulated at 4 degrees C and up-regulated by H2O2. Disc diffusion assays showed that the AcceFE4 recombinant protein-expressing bacteria had a smaller killing zone than the control group with the paraquat, HgCl2 and cumyl hydroperoxide treatments. Moreover, when the gene was knocked down by RNA interference, we observed that multiple oxidant genes (i.e., AccSOD, AccGST, AccTrx, AccMsrA, and others) were down-regulated in the knockdown samples. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) activity levels were reduced in the knockdown samples relative to the control group. Finally, we measured the enzyme activity of carboxylesterase and found that the enzyme activity was also reduced in the silent samples. Together, these data suggest that AcceFE4 may be involved in the oxidative resistance response during adverse stress.

AB G-quadruplex structures in the 50 UTR of mRNAs are widely considered to suppress translation without affecting transcription. The current study describes the comprehensive analysis of proteins binding to four different G-quadruplex motifs located in mRNAs of the cancer-related genes Bcl-2, NRAS, MMP16, and ARPC2. Following metabolic labeling (Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell culture, SILAC) of proteins in the human cell line HEK293, G-quadruplex binding proteins were enriched by pull-down assays and identified by LC-orbitrap mass spectrometry. We found different patterns of interactions for the G-quadruplex motifs under investigation. While the G-quadruplexes in the mRNAs of NRAS and MMP16 specifically interacted with a small number of proteins, the Bcl-2 and ARPC2 G-quadruplexes exhibited a broad range of proteinaceous interaction partners with 99 and 82 candidate proteins identified in at least two replicates, respectively. The use of a control composed of samples from all G-quadruplex-forming sequences and their mutated controls ensured that the identified proteins are specific for RNA G-quadruplex structures and are not general RNA-binding proteins. Independent validation experiments based on pull-down assays and Western blotting confirmed the MS data. Among the interaction partners were many proteins known to bind to RNA, including multiple heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). Several of the candidate proteins are likely to reflect stalling of the ribosome by RNA G-quadruplex structures. Interestingly, additional proteins were identified that have not previously been described to interact with RNA. Gene ontology analysis of the candidate proteins revealed that many interaction partners are known to be tumor related. The majority of the identified RNA G-quadruplex interacting proteins are thought to be involved in post-transcriptional processes, particularly in splicing. These findings indicate that protein-G-quadruplex interactions are not only important for the fine-tuning of translation but are also relevant to the regulation of mRNA maturation and may play an important role in tumor biology.

AB Chronic kidney disease is associated with the accumulation of a large range of uremic retention solutes as referred to as uremic toxins. Some of these compounds belong to the group of Protein Bound Uremic Toxins (PBUT) due to their tight interactions with plasma proteins and especially serum albumin. These PBUT therefore exist in the bloodstream into two forms: a major bound (and non-diffusible) fraction and a minor free fraction. As a result, these compounds are poorly removed by most of the renal replacement therapies (such as hemodialysis) and their concentration can hardly be decreased in end-stage renal disease patients. An increase of the free fraction of PBUT could be achieved using chemical displacers that could compete with PBUT for binding to serum albumin. This review summarizes and discusses the interest of chemicals displacers as a valuable option to enhance PBUT removal in CKD patients.

AB Trichodiene synthase, a terpene fold enzyme catalyzes the first reaction of trichodermin biosynthesis that is an economically important secondary metabolite. Sequence search analysis revealed that the proteins containing terpene fold are present in bacteria, fungi and plants. Terpene fold protein from Selaginella moellendorffii, a lycophyte, appeared at the interface of the microbes and plants in the evolutionary scale. Amino acid residues present around the catalytic pocket determines the size of the substrate as well as product molecules. It has been observed that the overall molecular evolution of the catalytic pockets dictates the choice of substrates/products of the proteins. It was further observed that N-terminus of multi-domain terpene fold proteins may assist in the interactions with the pyrophosphate part of the substrates. The phylogenetic analysis of these proteins further revealed that the enzymes are clustered into groups based on the domains present additional to the catalytic domains. We have also observed inter-domain 'puckering forceps' type motions in the multi-domains using normal mode analysis which were further correlated with their functions. The evolutionary clustering of these proteins was also influenced by the presence/absence of cofactor interacting motifs. These results may be used to modify/enhance the functions of these enzymes using protein engineering methods.

AB Objective: Hypoxia is a common phenomenon in solid tumor microenvironment. Thereby, the aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of tumor metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulated by lncRNA CPS1 intronic transcript 1 (CPS1-IT1) under hypoxia in CRC.
   Methods: Expression of lncRNA CPS1-IT1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and autophagy related protein (LC3) were initially assessed in human CRC tissues and in a series of CRC cell lines. The relationship of CPS1-IT1, HIF-1 alpha and autophagy were analyzed in CRC were performed through in vitro and in vivo functional assays.
   Results: Expression of CPS1-IT1 were significantly reduced, while HIF-1 alpha and LC3-II were increased in CRC tissues and cell lines. Then, in vitro assays revealed that CPS1-IT1 suppresses EMT and autophagy by inhibiting the activation of HIF-1 alpha in CRC. An in vivo animal model also demonstrated the tumor suppressor mechanism of CPS1-IT1.
   Conclusion: In this study, we found that hypoxia induce autophagy, and inhibition of autophagy could suppress tumor metastasis and EMT in CRC. Additionally, lncRNA CPS1-IT might suppresses metastasis and EMT by inhibiting hypoxia-induced autophagy through inactivation of HIF-1 alpha in CRC.

AB The multisubunit Mediator is an evolutionary conserved transcriptional coregulatory complex in eukaryotes. It is needed for the transcriptional regulation of gene expression in general as well as in a gene specific manner. Mediator complex subunits interact with different transcription factors as well as components of RNA Pol II transcription initiation complex and in doing so act as a bridge between gene specific transcription factors and general Pol II transcription machinery. Specific interaction of various Mediator subunits with nuclear receptors (NRs) and other transcription factors involved in metabolism has been reported in different studies. Evidences indicate that ligand-activated NRs recruit Mediator complex for RNA Pol II-dependent gene transcription. These NRs have been explored as therapeutic targets in different metabolic diseases; however, they show side-effects as targets due to their overlapping involvement in different signaling pathways. Here we discuss the interaction of various Mediator subunits with transcription factors involved in metabolism and whether specific interaction of these transcription factors with Mediator subunits could be potentially utilized as therapeutic strategy in a variety of metabolic diseases.

AB Dendritic cell factor 1 (DCF1) is a transmembrane protein that plays important roles in regulating neural stem cell differentiation and dendritic spine formation. Apart from its cytoplasmic functions, DCF1 plays a role in autophagy during the regulation of amyloid precursor proteins. However, the subcellular localization of DCF1 remains unknown. Therefore, in this study, DCF1 tagged with green fluorescent protein was transiently expression in HelaS3 and HEK293T cells. The results showed that DCF1 was widely expressed in different organelles, including the mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, endosomes and lysosomes. An iodixanol step gradient further confirmed that DCF1 is localized to the mitochondria, endosomes, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and proteasome. Finally, functional analysis of the mitochondria revealed that DCF1 affected the expression and localization of MGST1. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of the subcellular localization of DCF1, which provides important information on complex functions mediated by DCF1.

AB N-6-methyl-2'-deoxyadenosine (m6dA) is a well characterized DNA modification in prokaryotes. Its existence in eukaryotic DNA remained doubtful until recently. Evidence suggests that the m6dA levels decrease with the increasing complexity of eukaryotic genomes. Analysis of m6dA levels in genome of lower eukaryotes reveals its role in gene regulation, nucleosome positioning and early development. In higher eukaryotes m6dA is enriched in nongenic region compared to genic region, preferentially in chromosome X and 13 suggesting a chromosome bias. High levels of m6dA during embryogenesis as compared to adult tissues are indicative of its importance during development and possible association with regeneration capabilities. Further, decreased levels of m6dA in diabetic patients has been correlated with expression of Fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) which acts as m6A demethylase. m6dA levels have also been reported to be decreased in different types of cancers. The present review highlights the role of m6dA modification in eukaryotic genomes and its functional importance in regulation of physiological and pathological processes.

AB D-Mannose isomerase (MI) reversibly isomerizes D-mannose to D-fructose, and is attractive for producing D-mannose from inexpensive D-fructose. It belongs to the N-acylglucosamine 2-epimerase (AGE) superfamily along with AGE, cellobiose 2-epimerase (CE), and aldose-ketose isomerase (AKI). In this study, Marinomonas mediterranea Marme_2490, showing low sequence identity with any known enzymes, was found to isomerize D-mannose as its primary substrate. Marme_2490 also isomerized D-lyxose and 4-OH D-mannose derivatives (D-talose and 4-O-monosaccharyl-D-mannose). Its activity for D-lyxose is known in other D-mannose isomerizing enzymes, such as MI and AKI, but we identified, for the first time, its activity for 4-OH D-mannose derivatives. Marme_2490 did not isomerize D-glucose, as known MIs do not, while AKI isomerizes both D-mannose and D-glucose. Thus, Marme_2490 was concluded to be an MI.
   The initial and equilibrium reaction products were analyzed by NMR to illuminate mechanistic information regarding the Marme_2490 reaction. The analysis of the initial reaction product revealed that beta-D-mannose was formed. In the analysis of the equilibrated reaction products in D2O, signals of 2-H of D-mannose and 1-H of D-fructose were clearly detected. This indicates that these protons are not substituted with deuterium from D2O and Marme_2490 catalyzes the intramolecular proton transfer between 1-C and 2-C.
   The crystal structure of Marme_2490 in a ligand-free form was determined and found that Marme_2490 is formed by an (alpha/alpha)(6)-barrel, which is commonly observed in AGE superfamily enzymes. Despite diverse reaction specificities, the orientations of residues involved in catalysis and substrate binding by Marme_2490 were similar to those in both AKI (Salmonella enterica AKI) and epimerase (Rhodothermus marinus CE). The Marme_2490 structure suggested that the alpha 7 ->alpha 8 and alpha 11 ->alpha 12 loops of the catalytic domain participated in the formation of an open substrate-binding site to provide sufficient space to bind 4-OH D-mannose derivatives.

AB The Nicotiana tabacum 4/1 protein (Nt-4/1) of unknown function expressed in plant vasculature has been shown to localize to cytoplasmic bodies associated with endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we analyzed molecular interactions of an Nt-4/1 mutant with a deletion of 90 N-terminal amino acid residues (Nt-4/1d90) having a diffuse GFP-like localization. Upon transient co-expression with VAP27, a membrane protein known to localize to the ER, ER-plasma membrane contact sites and plasmodesmata, Nt-4/1d90 was concentrated around the cortical ER tubules, forming a network matching the shape of the cortical ER. Additionally, in response to mechanical stress, Nt-4/1d90 was re-localized to small spherical bodies, whereas the subcellular localization of VAP27 remained essentially unaffected. The Nt-4/1d90-containing bodies associated with microtubules, which underwent noticeable bundling under the conditions of mechanical stress. The Nt-4/1d90 re-localization to spherical bodies could also be induced by incubation at an elevated temperature, although under heat shock conditions the re-localization was less efficient and incomplete. An Nt-4/1d90 mutant, which had phosphorylation-mimicking mutations in a predicted cluster of four potentially phosphorylated residues, was found to both inefficiently re-localize to spherical bodies and tend to revert back to the initial diffuse localization. The presented data show that Nt-4/1 has a potential for response to stresses that is manifested by its deletion mutant Nt-4/1d90, and this response can be mediated by protein dephosphorylation.

AB Thraustochytrium is a marine protist producing a specific profile of nutritionally important fatty acids, including very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLCPUFAs) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), even chain saturated fatty acids (SFAs) palmitic acid (16:0), and odd chain SFAs pentadecanoic acid (15:0). To study how these fatty acids are synthesized, a series of radiolabeled precursors were used to trace the biosynthetic process in vivo and in vitro. When Thraustochytrium was fed with long chain fatty acid intermediates such as [1-C-14]-oleic acid, [1-C-14]-linoleic acid and [1-C-14]-alpha-linolenic acid, no VLCPUFAs were produced, indicating that the aerobic pathway for the biosynthesis of VLCPUFAs was not functional in Thraustochytrium. When fed with [1-C-14]-acetic acid, both SFAs and VLCPUFAs were labeled, and when fed with [1-C-14]-propionic acid, mainly SFAs were labeled. However, when fed with [1-C-14]-acetic acid in the presence of cerulenin, a type I FAS inhibitor, only VLCPUFAs were labeled, and when fed with [1-C-14]-propionic acid in the presence of cerulenin, neither SFAs nor VLCPUFAs were labeled. This result clearly indicates that the type I fatty acid synthase (FAS) in Thraustochytrium could use acetic acid and propionic acid as the primers to synthesize even chain and odd chain SFAs, respectively, and VLCPUFAs were synthesized by the PUFA synthase using acetic acid as the primer. In addition, radioactive acetic acid could label both phospholipids (PL) and triacylglycerols (TAG), and VLCPUFAs appeared first and were largely accumulated in PL, whereas TAG accumulated much more SFAs than VLCPUFAs. The in vitro assay with [1-C-14]-malonyl-CoA in presence of cerulenin showed that the crude protein of Thraustochytrium produced only VLCPUFAs, not SFAs, further confirming the role of the PUFA synthase in the biosynthesis of VLCPUFAs. Collectively, these results have elucidated the biochemical mechanisms for the biosynthesis of all fatty acids in Thraustochytrium.

AB Novel methods of molecular modeling help solving urgent problems in drug design, directed evolution of biocatalysts and biosensors, and a lot of other research fields. Implementation of such methods to organophosphorus hydrolase being perfect research object that hydrolyzes dangerous neurotoxic organophosphates could intensify development of antidote and protective preparations to treat poisoning. Structures of enzyme-polyelectrolyte complexes (EPCs) based on hexahistidine-tagged organophosphorus hydrolase (His(6)-OPH) with different biopolymers (various modifications of polyglutamic and polyaspartic acid, as well as hydroxyethyl starch and succinylated gelatin) were simulated at different pH using molecular docking. A number of EPCs with expected "positive" effect on maintaining the maximum level of His(6)-OPH activity, and some "negative" options were produced, and their catalytic performance was studied. The theoretical results were experimentally confirmed for four of the six "positive" options. EPCs obtained possessed up to 20-40% higher catalytic efficiency in hydrolysis reactions of Paraoxon and Parathion-methyl as compared with that of the native His(6)-OPH. The results obtained may be a good proof of concept for implementation of molecular docking to calculate model complexes of proteins with (bio) polymers of 6.4-105.5 kg/mol.

AB Dihydroxy-1-selenolane (DHS) previously reported to exhibit radioprotective activity was investigated to understand its mechanism of action in CHO cells of epithelial origin. DHS pre-treatment at 25 mu M for 16 h significantly protected CHO cells from radiation (4-11 Gy)-induced delayed mitotic cell death. Further to examine, how increased cellular uptake can influence this mechanism, studies have been performed with DHS-C-6, a lipophilic conjugate of DHS. Accordingly CHO cells pre-treated with DHS-C-6, showed increased survival against radiation exposure. Notably treatment with both DHS and DHS-C-6 significantly increased glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in cells by similar to 2.5 fold. Additionally, the compound DHS or DHS-C-6 led to faster repair of DNA in irradiated cells and subsequently inhibited the G2/M arrest. Anticipating the role of GPx in radioprotection, our investigations revealed that addition of mercaptosuccinic acid, a pharmacological inhibitor of GPx reversed all the above effects of DHS or DHS-C-6. Further inhibitors of check point kinase 1 (CHK1) and DNA-protein kinase (DNA-PK) although abrogated the radioprotective effect of DHS or DHS-C-6 separately, did not show additive effect in combination with GPx inhibitor, suggesting their cross talk. In contrast to these results, both DHS and DHS-C-6 treatment did not protect spleen lymphocytes from the radiation-induced apoptosis. Thus results confirmed that both DHS and DHS-C-6 protected cells from radiation-induced mitotic death by augmenting DNA repair in a GPx dependant manner.

AB We have previously shown that YB-1 is the only protein of the HEK293 cell cytoplasmic (S100) extract that specifically interacts with RNA hairpins each containing one of the motifs ACCAGCCU (1), CAGU-GAGC (2) and UAAUCCCA (3), which had been identified as often found in exosomal RNA and proposed as potential cis-acting elements targeting RNAs into exosomes. Here we explored the interactions of YB-1 with a fragment of the 30-untranslated region (UTR) of septin 14 mRNA (SEPT14 RNA), which contains all three motifs. We demonstrated the occurrence of YB-1 among proteins pulled down from the HEK293 S100 extract using biotinylated SEPT14 RNA. With recombinant YB-1, it was found that SEPT14 RNA can bind up to 5 moles of protein per mole of RNA in a cooperative manner, which was shown to be mainly facilitated by the presence of the above motifs. RNA hairpins with motifs 1 and 2 competed with SEPT14 RNA for binding to the protein, whereas that with motif 3 was less competitive, in accordance with the affinity of YB-1 for these RNA hairpins. With YB-1-bound RNA, nucleotides protected from attack by hydroxyl radicals were revealed in all three motifs, although hairpins with motif 2 and especially with motif 1 contained many protected nucleotides outside the motifs, suggesting that the specific environments of these motifs contribute significantly to the YB-1 binding. An analysis of the environments of motifs 1-3 in the HEK293 cell mRNA 30 UTRs gained from RNA-seq data led us to conclude that the primary binding sites of YB-1 in the 30 UTRs are hairpins containing some part of the motif along with its specific surroundings; the consensus sequences of these hairpins were derived. Thus, our findings provide a new understanding of the structural basis of the interactions between YB-1 and mRNAs carrying the aforementioned motifs.

AB KRAS is often found mutated in lethal cancers and should be an important target for anticancer drug development. However, no effective inhibitor has been reported so far, prompting the scientific community to describe the RAS proteins as nearly "undruggable". Recent approaches developed to modulate KRAS protein expression comprises the targeting of G-quadruplex (G4) structures formed within the nuclease hypersensitive element of KRAS promoter region, by designing small and specific ligands to stabilize the tertiary fold and reduce gene expression. In this work, we report in vitro and in silico studies of novel acridine orange (AO) derivatives (C-3-C-8), developed as G4 stabilizing agents. The results show that the ligands bind with high affinity and stabilize KRAS22-RT G4 with modest specificity over duplex DNA. The most promising ligand C-8 stabilizes the structure by approximate to 40 degrees C. Molecular docking using NMR-derived distance restraints reveal atomic details about the ligand structural features in the interaction with KRAS22-RT G4. In vitro studies with HeLa cells show that the ligands are cytotoxic with IC50 values between 0.9 mu M and 5.7 mu M. Moreover, the ligands tend to localize in the nucleus as shown by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Overall, these results show that the reported AO ligands display favourable properties as G4 ligands and this study provides structural detail for the development of lead KRAS G4 ligands.

AB This study was designed to evaluate the toxic effects of diterpenoids separated from the roots of Euphorbia pekinensis, a type of widely used traditional Chinese medicine. This herb has intestinal toxicity associated with its complex diterpenoids. In this study, the diterpenoids (pekinenin A, pekinenin C, pekinenin F, pekinenin G, yuexiandajisu A, (-)-(1S)-15-hydroxy-18-carboxycembrene) elevated the expression of interleukin 1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha in a dose-dependent manner at doses of 6.25, 12.5, and 25 mu M in RAW264.7 monocultures. Pekinenin C increased the expression of phosphorylated I kappa B and phosphorylated p65 in RAW264.7 monocultures, indicating that it stimulated a substantial inflammatory response and activated the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway. A co-culture model of RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cells and HT-29 human intestinal epithelial cells was established to study the correlation between inflammation and aquaporin (AQP) expression and to evaluate the toxicity of different diterpenoids from E. pekinensis. Pekinenin C (6.25, 12.5, and 25 mM) increased AQP3 mRNA and protein expression of HT-29 cells in the co-culture system in a dose-dependent manner but not in HT-29 monocultures. AQP3 mRNA and protein expression peaked at 2 and 3 h of HT-29 cells in the co-culture system, respectively. In contrast, their expression peaked more slowly in the monoculture system. After the specific NF-kB inhibitor BAY11-7082 (5, 10, and 20 mM) was added to the co-culture system, the release of cytokines and increased AQP3 expression caused by pekinenin C were inhibited. Comparisons of the representative monomeric compound pekinenin C, diterpenoid monomer mixtures, and total diterpenoids from E. pekinensis showed that the monomer mixtures had the most toxicity. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that E. pekinensis induces inflammation and increases the expression of AQP3, causing disorders of water metabolism, which may lead to gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea.

AB During feeding with blood meal, female Aedes aegypti can transmit infectious agents, such as dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika viruses. Dengue virus causes human mortality in tropical regions of the world, and there is no specific treatment or vaccine with maximum efficiency being used for these infections. In the vector-virus interaction, the production of several molecules is modulated by both mosquitoes and invading agents. However, little information is available about these molecules in the Ae. aegypti mosquito during dengue infection. Inhibitors of the pacifastin family have been described to participate in the immune response of insects and Pac2 is the only gene of this family present in Ae. aegypti being then chosen for investigation. Pac2 was expressed in E. coli, purified and analyzed by mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE. The Pac2 transcript was detected by qPCR, and its protein levels were assessed by Western blotting. The inhibitory activity of Pac2 was measured using its K-i, IC50 and zymography. Mosquito infections with DENV were introduced with the Brazilian ACS-46 DENV-2 strain propagated in C6/36 cells. In the present work, we showed that it is possibly involved in the interaction of the mosquitoes with the dengue virus. The Pac2 transcript was detected in larvae and in both the salivary gland and midgut of Ae. aegypti females, while the native protein was identified in females 3 h post-blood meal. Pac2 is a strong inhibitor of trypsin-like and thrombin-like proteases, which are present in 4th instar larvae midgut and females 24 h after blood meal. During DENV infection, up regulation of Pac2 expression occurs in the salivary gland and midgut. Pac2 is the first Pacifastin inhibitor member described in mosquitoes. Our results suggest that Pac2 acts on mosquito serine proteases, mainly the trypsin-like type, and is under transcriptional control by virus infection signals to allow its survival in the vector or by the mosquito as a defense mechanism against virus infection.
