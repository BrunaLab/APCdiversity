AB There is substantial variation between individuals in the immune response to vaccinations. The intestinal microbiome plays a crucial rule in the development and regulation of the immune system and therefore its composition might affect how individuals respond to vaccinations. In this review, we summarise studies that investigated the influence of the intestinal microbiome on humoral and cellular vaccine responses.
   To date, only four studies (three in infants and one in adults) have investigated the influence of the intestinal microbiome on vaccine responses. All found an association between the intestinal microbiome and vaccine responses. Despite the heterogeneity in study designs (including different vaccines, schedules, timing of collection of stool and blood samples, analysis methods and reporting of results on different taxonomic levels), findings across studies were consistent: a higher relative abundance of the phylum Actinobacteria (oral and parenteral vaccines) and Firmicutes (oral vaccines) was associated with both higher humoral and higher cellular vaccine responses, while a higher relative abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria (oral and parenteral vaccines) and Bacteroidetes (oral vaccines) was associated with lower responses.
   Further, well-designed, adequately powered studies using whole-genome sequencing (to include the influence of viruses, fungi and parasites) are needed to investigate in more detail the influence of the intestinal microbiome on vaccine responses. This will help identify strategies to improve vaccine efficacy and duration of protection, particularly in infancy when the intestinal microbiome is more amenable to external influences and plays an important role in the development of the immune system.

AB Malaria infection is the severe health concern for a long time. As per the WHO reports, the malarial infection causes huge mortality all around the world and is incomparable with any other infectious diseases. The absence of effective treatment options and increasing drug resistance to the available therapeutics like artemisinin and other derivatives demand an efficient alternative to overcome this death burden. Here, we performed the literature survey and sorted the Plasmodium falciparum secretory and membrane proteins to design multi-epitope subunit vaccine using an adjuvant, B-cell- and T-cell epitopes. Every helper T-lymphocyte (HTL) epitope was IFN-gamma positive and IL-4 non-inducer. The physicochemical properties, allergenicity, and antigenicity of designed vaccine were analyzed for the safety concern. Homology modeling and refinement were performed to obtain the functional tertiary structure of vaccine protein followed by its molecular docking with the toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) immune receptor. Molecular dynamics simulation was performed to check the interaction and stability of the receptor-ligand complex. Lastly, in silico cloning was performed to generate the restriction clone of designed vaccine for the futuristic expression in a microbial expression system. This way, we designed the multiepitope subunit vaccine to serve the people living in the global endemic zone. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Control of measles was the focus of a national workshop held in 2015 in Sydney, Australia, bringing together stakeholders in disease control and immunisation to discuss maintaining Australia's measles elimination status in the context of regional and global measles control.
   The global epidemiology of measles was reviewed, including outbreaks in countries that have achieved elimination, such as the Disneyland outbreak in the United States and large outbreaks in Sydney, Australia. Transmission of measles between Australia and New Zealand occurs, but has not been a focus of control measures. Risk groups, the genetic and seroepidemiology of measles as well as surveillance, modelling and waning vaccine-induced immunity were reviewed. Gaps in policy, research and practice for maintaining measles elimination status in Australia were identified and recommendations were developed.
   Elimination of measles globally is challenging because of the infectiousness of measles and the need for 2-dose vaccine coverage rates in excess of 95% in all countries to achieve it. Until this occurs, international travel will continue to permit measles importation from endemic countries to countries that have achieved elimination. When measles cases are imported, failure to diagnose and isolate cases places the health system at risk of measles outbreaks. Vaccine funding models can result in gaps in vaccine coverage for adults and migrants. Australia introduced a whole-of-life immunisation register in 2016 and catch-up vaccination for at-risk communities, which will improve measles control. Research on diagnosis, immunology, case management and modelling of vaccination strategies are important to ensure continued control of measles.

AB Background: Vibrio cholera is a major contributor of diarrheal illness that causes significant morbidity and mortality globally. While there is literature on the health economics of diarrheal illnesses more generally, few studies have quantified the cost-of-illness and cost-effectiveness of cholera-specific prevention and control interventions. The present systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of the literature specific to cholera as it pertains to key health economic measures.
   Methods: A systematic review was performed with no date restrictions up through February 2017 in PubMed, Econlit, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Review to identify relevant health economics of cholera literature. After removing duplicates, a total of 1993 studies were screened and coded independently by two reviewers, resulting in 22 relevant studies. Data on population, methods, and results (cost of-illness and cost-effectiveness of vaccination) were compared by country/region. All costs were adjusted to 2017 USD for comparability.
   Results: Costs per cholera case were found to be rather low: <$100 per case in most settings, even when costs incurred by patients/families and lost productivity are considered. When wider socioeconomic costs are included, estimated costs are >$1000/case. There is adequate evidence to support the economic value of vaccination for the prevention and control of cholera when vaccination is targeted at high-incidence populations and/or areas with high case fatality rates due to cholera. When herd immunity is considered, vaccination also becomes a cost-effective option for the general population and is comparable in cost-effectiveness to other routine immunizations.
   Conclusions: Cholera vaccination is a viable short-to-medium term option, especially as the upfront costs of building water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure are considerably higher for countries that face a significant burden of cholera. While WASH may be the more cost-effective solution in the long-term when implemented properly, cholera vaccination can still be a feasible, cost-effective strategy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Vaccination coverage rates have stagnated in the past several years in many middle-income countries (MICs), especially in the UNICEF Middle East and North Africa region, with political and economic turmoil as contributing factors. This paper reviews country experiences with three under-utilized strategies aimed at increasing vaccination coverage and reducing disparities between socio-economic and geographic groups in MICs. These strategies include: (1) identifying and accounting for displaced, mobile and neglected populations; (2) assessing and addressing missed opportunities for vaccination, including by expanding immunization into the second year of life and beyond; and (3) engaging effectively with the private/nongovernmental health providers in the coordination, provision and reporting of immunization services. The examples focus primarily on quality data collection, analysis, use and reporting aspects of the strategies. While data are limited, there is evidence from MICs that each of these strategies can have a positive impact on vaccination coverage, especially among marginalized populations. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB The burden of pneumococcal disease at Hajj has not been precisely evaluated through a systematic review. To this end we have conducted a systematic review on the burden of clinical infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae among Hajj pilgrims.
   Major electronic databases including OVID Medline, Web of Science, OVID Embase, Social Sciences Citation Index, Google Scholar and relevant websites (e.g., online Saudi Epidemiology Bulletin) were searched by using MeSH terms and text words containing but not limited to 'Hajj', pneumonia and S. pneumoniae. This was buttressed by hand searching of reference lists of identified studies.
   Of 21 full text papers reviewed, nine articles were included in this review. Seven studies reported the burden of pneumococcal pneumonia and the other two reported the burden of invasive pneumococcal diseases including meningitis and sepsis. The proportion of pneumonia that was pneumococcal ranged from 1% to 54% of bacteriologically confirmed pneumonias. The pneumococcus accounted for 2/3rd of bacteriologically diagnosed meningitis cases, and 1/3rd of confirmed cases of sepsis. Case fatality rate of pneumococcal pneumonia was recorded in only two studies: 33.3% and 50%. Only one study provided data on antimicrobial susceptibility of S. pneumoniae isolates, reporting 33.3% to be penicillin resistant. None of the included studies provided data on serotype distribution of S. pneumoniae.
   This systematic review highlights the significance of pneumococcal disease during Hajj, and demonstrates paucity of data on its burden particularly on disease-causing serotype. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Mycobacterial infections greatly affect human and animal health worldwide, and vaccines are effective, sustainable and economic interventions for the prevention and control of these infectious diseases. Recent results support the use of zebrafish as a model for studying the pathophysiology of mycobacterial infection and for the development of novel interventions for tuberculosis (TB) control. Recently, we showed that oral immunization with the heat-inactivated M. bovis vaccine (M. bovis IV) protect wild boar against TB, and suggested that this vaccine may controls mycobacterial infection in other species. Methods: In this study we evaluated the effect of M. bovis IV on the control of mycobacteriosis in zebrafish mucosally vaccinated by immersion and challenged intraperitoneally with Mycobacterium marinum. Results: The results showed that the M. bovis IV administered by immersion protected zebrafish against mycobacteriosis caused by M. marinum by reduction in mycobacterial infection, the number of mycobacteria per granuloma and the number of granulomas per fish. An IgM antibody response against M. bovis antigens was developed in vaccinated fish. Evidences suggested that the protective mechanism elicited by mucosal vaccination with M. bovis IV in zebrafish was based on the activation of the innate immune response through the C3 pathway.

AB Background: Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) contributes to maintaining immune homeostasis. Polymorphisms (SNPs) of the IDO encoding gene (IDO1) influence the IDO activity. Interferon (IFN)-lambda 3 induces IDO expression. We aimed to investigate whether IDO1 variants are associated with anti-HBs production in response to HBV vaccination or infection, interact with IFN-lambda 3 associated variants of IFNL4, and influence survival of hemodialysis (HD) patients. We also tested circulating IDO concerning IDO1 SNPs and plasma IFN-lambda 3 and anti-HBs levels.
   Methods: The study included HD patients who had established status concerning responsiveness to HBV vaccination (n = 1022) or were exposed to HBV (n = 315). Ability to generate anti-HBs was diagnosed if anti-HBs after vaccination or infection exceeded 10IU/L. Genotyping of IDO1 (rs3739319 A<G, rs9657182 C<T), IFNL4 rs8099917 G<T and IFNIA rs12979860 C>T polymorphisms was carried out by high-resolution melting curve analysis. Circulating IDO and IFN-lambda 3 were measured with ELISA in 57 subjects. Survival probability was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.
   Results: IDO1 SNPs did not correlate with the ability to produce anti-HBs after vaccination or infection. Anti-HBs titers, including a frequency of anti-HBs >= 1000IU/1, also did not associate with IDO1 SNPs, but there was an epistatic interaction between rs9657182, rs8099917, and rs12979860 concerning anti-HBs titers (P = 0.028). Significant associations between IDO1 SNPs and circulating IDO were not demonstrated. Anti-HBs titers negatively correlated with plasma IDO (r = -0.358, P = 0.006), and positively with circulating IFN-lambda 3 (r = 0.498, P = 0.00008). IDO and IFN-lambda 3 did not correlate. Patients possessing the rs9657182 TT genotype showed higher infection-related mortality, also in multivariate analysis (HR 2.073, 1.221-3.518, P = 0.007).
   Conclusions: IDO1 rs9657182, IFNLA rs8099917, and IFNL4 rs12979860 show epistatic interaction concerning anti-HBs titers. Overreacting immune responses to HBsAg occur in patients with lower IDO but simultaneously higher IFN-lambda 3 levels. The rs9657182 TT genotype associates with infection-related mortality of HD patients. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Oncogenic high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections cause a substantial number of genital and non-genital cancers worldwide. Approximately 70% of all cervical cancers are caused by the high-risk HPV16 and 18 types. The remaining 30% can be attributed to twelve other high-risk HPV-types. Highly efficacious 2-valent, 4-valent and 9-valent L1 protein based prophylactic HPV vaccines are available however with limited cross-protection. To further increase the coverage, development of a multivalent crossprotective HPV vaccine is currently focused on the conserved N-terminus of HPV's L2 protein. We have developed a vaccine candidate based on the rare human adenovirus type 35 (HAdV35) vector that displays a concatemer of L2 protein epitopes from four different HPV-types via protein IX (pIX). A mix of two heterologous HAdV35 pIX-L2 display vectors present highly conserved linear epitopes of nine HPV-types. Each HAdV35 pIX-L2 display vector exhibits a good manufacturability profile. HAdV35 pIXL2 display vaccine vectors were immunogenic and induced neutralizing antibodies against HPV-types included in the vaccine and cross-neutralizing antibodies against distant a HPV-type not included in the vaccine in mice. The HAdV35 pIX-L2 display vectors offer an opportunity for a multivalent HAdVbased prophylactic HPV vaccine. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global public health problem. New immunization methods against TB are urgently needed. Plasmid DNA with a microneedle patch is a potentially attractive strategy to improve the immune effect. A DNA vaccine encoding the secreted protein Ag85B of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was immunized in the skin using microneedles, which can improve protective immunity compared to conventional intramuscular (IM) injection. There is no significant difference between microneedle patch (MNP) and IM immunization when the immunizing dose is low (4.2 mu g). However, the results for detecting humoral immunity showed MNP immunization could better provoke an antibody response than IM when the dose is high (12.6 mu g). A similar result was observed in cellular immune responses by measuring the cytokines in splenocytes. The effective protection of MNP can also be demonstrated by counting bacteria and analyzing the survival rate. This study indicated that DNA vaccination in the skin using dissolving microneedles may provide a new strategy against TB. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Gram-negative pathogen toxigenic P. multocida causes progressive atrophic rhinitis (PAR) in swine throughout the world. Although some vaccines are being developed against PAR, their efficacy has not been evaluated using carbopol. In our study, a mixture of killed B. bronchiseptica and P. multocida bacteria, combined with recombinant proteins containing the C- and N-termini of PMT, was emulsified using two different adjuvants (1SA-15A and carbopol 971). The efficacy of these two vaccines was evaluated in a mouse model. Balb/C mice were immunized twice at a 14-day interval. Two weeks after the secondary immunization, blood samples were collected and the mice were challenged with toxigenic P. multocida. Thirty-five days later, the mice were euthanized, blood and tissue samples were collected. Compared with mice inoculated with vaccine emulsified with ISA-15A, higher titers of SN (1:64) and significantly increased levels of TNF-alpha,IL-6 and IL-17A were observed in mice inoculated with vaccine emulsified with the carbopol 971P. Especially, mice immunized with vaccine emulsified with the carbopol 971P had no detectable pathological changes in snouts or organs after challenge. The results demonstrated that carbopol adjuvanted vaccine provides good protection against PAR and P. multocida infection which can induce robust humoral and cell-mediated responses. We conclude that the carbopol adjuvanted vaccine is a good candidate for PAR prevention. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralization (MN) antibodies are often used as a correlate of protection for influenza. However, these manual assays are labor-intensive and difficult to standardize due to variability in biologic reagents used and subjective interpretation of the results.
   Methods: Sera with known HAI and MN titers were used to assess a novel test based on the inhibition of fluorescence 'dequenching'. Whole influenza virions (A/California/07/2009 (H1N1), A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2) and B/Brisbane/60/2008) labelled with 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylin dodicarbocyanine perchlorate (DiD) were exposed to serial dilutions of serum and mixed with turkey red blood cells followed by acidification of the media (pH 5.0-5.5). The H1N1 and B/Brisbane strains were high hemagglutinating while the H3N2 strain had low hemagglutinating activity. In some experiments, labelled virions were subjected to repetitive freeze-thaw cycles prior to use in the assay.
   Results: In the absence of detectable HAI/MN antibodies, there were consistent and substantial increases from baseline DiD fluorescence upon acidification. Sera with known high titer HAI/MN antibodies reduced or completely prevented DiD dequenching at low dilutions with progressive increases in fluorescence at higher dilutions, which permitted a reproducible assignment of an antibody 'titer' based on baseline and acidified DiD fluorescence values. The 'titers' measured by the DiD dequenching assay were highly correlated with HAI/MN results for the H1N1 and B strains (Spearman's correlation coefficients (r(s)) 0.874 to 0.946, p< 10(-7) to TO-35). Correlations with HAI/MN titres for the low-hemagglutinating H3N2 strain tested were lower but remained statistically significant (r(s) 0.547-0.551, p< 0.004). Freeze-thawing of the DiD pre-stained virus stocks had no significant impact on the results of the assay.
   Conclusions: The DiD dequenching assay may be a labour-saving and more objective alternative to the classic serologies. This novel assay could theoretically be standardized across laboratories using prestained virions and has the potential to be fully automated. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Atypical ruminant pestiviruses are closely related to the two bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) species, BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. While there is evidence of cross-protective immune responses between BVDV-1 and BVDV-2, despite antigenic differences, there is little information on the antigenic cross-reactivity with atypical ruminant pestiviruses. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the specificity of antibody and T cell responses induced by experimental infection of calves with BVDV-1 strain Ho916, Th/04_KhonKaen (TKK), an Asiatic atypical ruminant pestivirus, or co-infection with both viruses. Homologous virus neutralization was observed in sera from both single virus infected and co-infected groups, while cross-neutralization was only observed in the TKK infected group. T cell IFN-gamma responses to both viruses were observed in the TKK infected animals, whereas Ho916 infected calves responded better to homologous virus. Specifically, IFN-gamma responses to viral non-structural protein, NS3, were observed in all infected groups while responses to viral glycoprotein, E2, were virus-specific. Broader antigen-specific cytokine responses were observed with similar trends between inoculation groups and virus species. The limited T cell and antibody immune reactivity of Ho916 inoculated animals to TKK suggests that animals vaccinated with current BVDV-1-based vaccines may not be protected against atypical ruminant pestiviruses.

TI High coverage of hepatitis B vaccination and low prevalence of chronic

   strategy

AB Background: Worldwide coverage of hepatitis B (HB) vaccination is increasing. This should be considered when determining the best strategy for catch-up HB vaccination in migrant children, who rarely have written proof of past immunizations. This study aimed to estimate HB vaccine protection, chronic HB prevalence and to identify determinants of vaccine protection.
   Methods: Newly arrived migrant children at Lausanne University Hospital from October 2014 to July 2017 were prospectively enrolled. Children and adolescents aged 1-18 years were approached for inclusion if they had no proof of past vaccinations and accepted a single dose of injected HB vaccine. HB surface antibody (anti-HBs) serology was performed after 4-6 weeks. Anti-HBs >= 100 IU/L were considered consistent with a booster-type antibody response. Patients with anti-HBs < 100 IU/L received additional dose(s) of HB vaccine, after exclusion of chronic HB in children with anti-HBs <10 IU/L. Potential determinants of vaccine response were compared between children with and without booster-type response.
   Results: Two hundred children were available for analysis. Median age was 8.9 years (IQR 4.8-12.9), and 97 (49%) were female. The majority (n = 124,62%) came from the region classified by the WHO as eastern Mediterranean. One hundred and sixty-one children (81%) had a booster-type antibody response. Only 1 patient (<1%) had chronic HB. In the multivariate analysis, younger age (OR per decreasing-year, 1.28; 95%CI, 1.05-1.57; p = 0.017) and migration from an urban area (OR 1.16; 95%CI, 1.01-1.33; p = 0.043) were the only significant determinants of booster-type response.
   Conclusion: Post-vaccine serology may be used to identify a high proportion of individuals in our pediatric migrant population with previous immunization for HB. Our study also showed extremely low prevalence of chronic HB. No variable could definitively determine the results of serology. Post-vaccine serology represents the most effective strategy in this context of high vaccine coverage. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a member of the Alphacoronaviridae genus within the Coronaviridae family. It is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea, a disease that can have mortality rates as high as 100% in suckling piglets. PEDV causes severe economic loss, and has been in existence for decades. A panzootic starting in 2010 renewed interest in the development of a universal vaccine toward PEDV. This report details several design changes made to a Hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAg)-based recombinant vaccine strategy, and their effect in vivo. Initially, several multi-antigen vaccine candidates were able to elicit antibodies specific to three out of four B-cell epitopes inserted into the chimeric proteins. However, a lack of virus neutralization led to a redesign of the vaccines. The focus of the newly redesigned vaccines was to elicit a strong immune response to the YSNIGVCK amino acid motif from PEDV. Genetically modified new vaccine candidates were able to elicit a strong antibody (Ab) response to the YSNIGVCK epitope, which correlated with an increased ability to neutralize the CO strain of PEDV. Additionally, the location of the inserted PEDV epitopes within the vector protein was shown to affect the immune recognition toward the native HBcAg during vaccination. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: Missed opportunities for vaccination (MOV) can result in inadequate protection against disease. Although healthcare provider reluctance to open multi-dose, lyophilized vaccine vials (particularly the measles-containing vaccine [MCV])for every eligible child due to concerns about wasting vaccine is a known reason for MOV, little is known about providers' related attitudes and practices.
   Methods: In 100 randomly selected health facilities and 24 districts of Cambodia, we surveyed healthcare providers and their district supervisors regarding routine vaccine administration and wastage knowledge and practices, and child caregivers (five per facility) regarding MOV. Vaccine stock management data covering six months were reviewed to calculate facility and district level wastage rates and vaccine usage patterns for six vaccines, including a recently introduced second dose of MCV (MCV2).
   Results: Response rates were 100/100 (100%) among facility staff, 48/48 (100%) among district staff, and 436/500 (87%) among caregivers. Mean facility-level wastage rates varied from 4% for single-dose diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-hepatitis B-Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine to 60% for 10-dose MCV; district-level wastage rates for all vaccines were 0%. Some vaccines had lower wastage rates in large facilities compared to small facilities. The mean MCV wastage rate was the same before and immediately after MCV2 introduction. Providers reported waiting for a mean of two children prior to opening an MCV vial, and 71% of providers reported offering MCV vaccination less frequently during scheduled vaccination sessions than other vaccines. Less than 5% of caregivers reported that their child had been turned away for vaccination, most frequently (65%) for MCV.
   Discussion: Although the MCV wastage rate in our study was in line with national targets, providers reported waiting for more than one child before opening an MCV vial, contrary to vaccine management guidelines. Future research should explore the causal links between provider practices related to vaccine wastage and their impact on vaccination coverage. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: Several states require schools and child cares to report vaccination rates, yet little is known about the impact of these policies. Our objectives were to assess: (1) predicted impact of vaccination rates on school/child care choice, (2) differences between vaccine hesitant and non-hesitant parents, and (3) differences by child's age.
   Methods: In 2016, a cross-sectional email survey of Colorado mothers with children <= 12 years old assessed value of vaccination rates in the context of school/child care choice. A willingness-to-pay framework measured preference for schools/child cares with different vaccination rates using tradeoff with commute time.
   Results: Response rate was 42% (679/1630). Twelve percent of respondents were vaccine hesitant. On a scale where 1 is "not important at all" and 4 is "very important" parents rated the importance of vaccination rates at 3.08. Respondents (including vaccine-hesitant respondents) would accept longer commutes to avoid schools/child cares with lower vaccination rates. Parents of child-care-age children were more likely to consider vaccination rates important.
   Conclusions: This study shows parents highly value vaccination rates in the context of school and child care choice. Both hesitant and non-hesitant parents are willing to accept longer commute times to protect their children from vaccine-preventable diseases. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Gonorrhea, an important sexually transmitted disease, is becoming a growing public health problem around the globe. Vaccination is considered the best long-term approach for control of infection. In this study, we designed a novel Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N. gonorrhoeae) DNA vaccine delivered by bacterial ghosts and characterized its immune responses in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate that bacterial ghosts greatly promoted BMDCs maturation and activation. Bacterial ghosts loaded with N. gonorrhoeae DNA vaccine were efficiently taken up by mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, oral immunization with the ghost vaccine candidate elicited greater CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses and induced higher IgG responses than N. gonorrhoeae DNA vaccine alone. In addition, mice immunized with the vaccine candidate responded with a significant rise in bactericidal antibody titer. These results suggest that bacterial ghosts may function as a vaccine adjuvant by promoting BMDCs maturation, which in turn enhances the immune responses to the vaccine antigens. This study also highlights the potential of using bacterial ghosts as antigen delivery system in the development of an efficacious gonorrhea vaccine. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Routine influenza and tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccination of pregnant women to prevent poor maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes is recommended practice; however, actual rates of influenza vaccine acceptance are typically well below the (Healthy People 2020, 2015) goal of 80%.
   Objective: We sought to identify barriers to accepting either vaccination.
   Materials and Methods: From December 2014 to April 2015 women were given a questionnaire eliciting their experiences, attitudes and history of influenza and Tdap vaccination in pregnancy during their routine prenatal care appointments at a tertiary care center. Patient demographics were included in the questionnaire. A similar questionnaire was administered to prenatal care providers. Patient influenza and Tdap vaccination acceptance rates were compared and predictors of vaccine acceptance were analyzed with bivariate logistic regression.
   Results: Out of the 400 patient questionnaires distributed, 338 (84.5%) were completed and returned; 24 of 45 (53.3%) provider questionnaires were returned. Vaccination acceptance rates were 70.7% for the influenza vaccine and 76.3% for the Tdap vaccine. The logistic regression model indicated that predictors of acceptance for either vaccine in pregnancy are patient attitude and previous vaccination history. Patient attitudes were more favorable towards Tdap than influenza vaccination. The combination of healthcare provider recommendation and educational materials was significantly predictive of both Tdap and influenza vaccine acceptance. The most common reasons given for declining the influenza vaccine were safety concerns; the most common reasons given for declining the Tdap vaccine were that patients did not think it was required again when they received the vaccine before pregnancy.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that providers can improve Tdap and influenza vaccination acceptance in pregnancy by recommending the vaccination in combination with provision of educational materials on the vaccines. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the only vaccine available against tuberculosis and the tuberculin skin test (TST) is the most widely used method to detect BCG take. However, subjects may remain TST-negative, even after several BCG administrations. To investigate some of the potential reasons underlying this inability of developing tuberculin sensitivity in response to BCG we compared the effect of different mycobacterial stimuli in the groups differently responding to tuberculin. TST was performed on 71 healthy adults aged 25-30 years, who had received BCG in their childhood, and considered TST-positive at >= 10 mm. Dendritic cells (DCs) were incubated with PPD, live BCG or rBCGhIL-18, producing human IL-18. The latter strain was used to investigate whether the production of IL-18 could overcome some of the immune read-out limitations in the TST-negative subjects. CD86, CD80, CD40, and DC-specific intracellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) expression was analysed by flow cytometry and IL-10, IL-23 and IP-10 secretion in culture supernatants by ELISA. In DCs-T cell co-cultures with naive and memory CD4(+) T cells, the IFN-gamma and IL-10 levels were determined by ELISA. We found no difference in IL-10 and IFN-gamma production by naive T cells between the TST-negative and TST-positive subjects. However, IFN-gamma was produced in significantly higher amounts by memory T cells incubated with PPD, BCG or rBCGhIL-18-pulsed DCs in TST-positive than in TST-negative subjects, whereas the numbers of the IFN-gamma-producing T cells were similar in both groups. This difference may be partially due to a decreased CD40 and enhanced reduction in DC-SIGN expression by DCs of TST-negative versus TST-positive subjects. A strong effect of IL-18 expression by rBCGhIL-18 on IL-23 production by the DC was seen in both groups, which likely was the reason for the increased IFN-gamma production by naive T cells upon incubation with mycobacteria-pulsed DC, regardless of the TST status.

AB The Japanese immunization program has made considerable recent progress. The introduction of several new vaccines, especially foreign-produced vaccines, and the inclusion of important new vaccines in the National Immunization Program (NIP) are closing the "vaccine gap",i.e., the delay in the Japanese immunization program relative to programs in other developed countries. Major progress in the Japanese immunization program since 2014 includes (1) elimination of measles in March 2015,(2) introduction of a varicella vaccine as a routine immunization in the NIP in October 2015, and (3) introduction of hepatitis B virus vaccines as routine immunizations in the NIP in October 2016. Despite these promising developments, important issues remain. First, the government withdrew the active recommendation for human papilloma virus vaccines temporarily in 2013. The withdrawal has continued and unresolved despite new scientific evidence confirming the safety of these vaccines. Second, a few important voluntary vaccines, including vaccines for mumps and rotavirus, have not been included in the NIP since their introduction to Japan. Finally, there are concerns related to a shortage of mandatory domestic vaccines, which was caused by a natural disaster in the area where a vaccine-producing factory was located. Additionally, the manufacturer included unauthorized additives in some vaccine products with falsifying the production-process records. To avoid problems related to vaccine shortages, essential vaccines need to be stockpiled, and the future vaccine needs for children should to be discussed. New initiatives must continue to close the vaccine gap, as this will protect children living in Japan from vaccine-preventable diseases. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A compound cycle system, which integrates an automotive waste heat recovery (WHR) and air conditioning (A/C) refrigeration functions, is proposed in this paper. The models of this compound cycle system, independent organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system and independent A/C system are built by Aspen Plus software. R134a and R1234yf are selected as working fluids because of their common use in air conditioning system. R245fa is employed as working fluid for independent ORC system as a comparison. The targets of this analysis are more power output and smaller heat transfer area. Linear weighted method is applied to optimize this multi-objective problem using the working fluid flow rate and WHR evaporating pressure as variables. The simulation results indicate that the compound system behaves better than independent system both in the power output and heat transfer area with the same working fluid. The independent system with R245fa-R134a generates the most power output of 13.01 kW. The compound system with R1234yf shows the smallest total heat transfer area and total heat transfer area decreasing ratios (THTADRs) are 6.2-14.8% comparing with independent systems.

AB Ni/Fe bimetallic catalysts were synthesized on an olivine support using the wetness impregnation (WI) and thermal fusion (TF) methods, and catalytic cracking and steam reforming on different tar model compounds (phenol and naphthalene) were investigated in a fixed bed reactor. The effects of the reaction temperature and space-time on the catalytic cracking activity of phenol and naphthalene were tested, and the influences of steam on the carbon molar ratio (S/C) and different synthesized methods on the steam reforming of phenol and naphthalene were also studied. In addition, the carbon deposited on the catalyst was analysed using temperature program oxidation (TPO), Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methods. The elemental composition of the catalyst was analysed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and the physiochemical properties of the catalysts were characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD), the BET surface area, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), TEM, Raman spectroscopy, temperature program reduction (TPR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that the structure of TF-Ni/Fe/olivine changed considerably compared with that of calcined olivine (mainly the Mg2SiO4 phase) and that a portion of Fe was fused into the olivine structure and reorganized into a new (Mg, Fe) Fe2O4 phase. After reduction, the Ni-Fe alloy was detected on both catalysts, and the particle size of the Ni-Fe alloy on TF-Ni/Fe/olivine was smaller than that of WI-Ni/Fe/olivine. The TF-Ni/Fe/olivine cracked phenol into small-molecule gas (CO and H-2) and a small quantity of olefin. By contrast, phenol was polymerized to naphthalene in the absence of a catalyst. The phenol and naphthalene steam reforming conversion on WI-Ni/Fe/olivine were both higher than that of TF-Ni/Fe/olivine. A 100-h stability test of phenol steam reforming on TF-Ni/Fe/olivine and WI-Ni/Fe/olivine was conducted, and TF-Ni/Fe/olivine showed higher stability in the early stages of the experiment due to stronger interactions between the active sites and olivine support. The deposited carbon from naphthalene steam reforming was more difficult to eliminate because it contained more C-beta and C-gamma, which had higher degrees of graphitization.

AB Biodiesel is an alternative fuel similar to conventional diesel. It is usually produced from straight vegetable oil, animal fat, tallow, non-edible plant oil and waste cooking oil. Its biodegradability, non-toxicity and being free of sulfur and aromatics makes it advantageous over the conventional petrol diesel. It emits less air pollutants and greenhouse gases other than nitrogen oxides. In addition, it is safer to handle and has lubricity benefits than fossil diesel. However, with all these environmental benefits, biodiesel could not be extensively applied as a complete substitute fuel for conventional diesel. The main reason, repeatedly mentioned by many researchers, is its higher cost of production. Reduction of the cost of biodiesel production (unit cost of production) can be attained through improving productivity of the technologies to increase yield, reducing capital investment cost and reducing the cost of raw materials. These demand a thorough execution of economic analysis among the available possible technology alternatives, catalyst alternatives, as well as feedstock alternatives so that the best option, in economic terms, can be selected. With this respect, there are a number of researches done to investigate economically better way of producing biodiesel as a substitute fuel. Accordingly, this paper is meant to review the researches done on economics of biodiesel production, emphasizing on the methods of assessment and determination of total investment cost and operation cost, as well as on assessment of economically better technology, catalyst and feedstock alternatives. It also gives emphasis on profitability of biodiesel production and the major system variables affecting economic viability of biodiesel production.

AB The thermoelectric (TE) device enables a conversion interface between the heat transfer and the electricity domain. Specifically, it can operate bi-directionally - Heat can be converted to electricity via the thermoelectric generator (TEG) effect and conversely, electricity can be converted to heat via the thermoelectric cooling (TEC) effect. As to date, most publications deal with the optimization of the TE device either in terms of the TEG performance or in terms of the TEC performance. This paper brings the two design approaches together to form a multi-objective optimization of the TE device. By performing such an optimization, the relationships between the TEG and TEC performance criterion are better established with key factors including any potential trade-off situations and possibilities for optimal design towards both objectives. Moreover, the key parameters that have the strongest influence on these criteria and the related trends are identified. Optimization results indicate that there is a strong correlation between the TEG performance and system mass but the correlation is less effective from the TEC perspective. On the other hand, the constraint requirements on the TEG design is found to have strong influence on the optimality of the TEC solutions.

AB A series of comb-like polymeric phase change materials, composed of poly(ethylene-graft-maleic anhydride)-g-octadecanol (EMC18) and octadecylamine-functionalized graphene oxide (GO-C18) and graphene oxide (GO), denoted as EMC18@GO-C18 and EMC18@GO, respectively, have been prepared through a solution mixing method. The structure, thermal performance, energy storage and release capability, cycle stability are deeply characterized. Shape-stability for EMC18@GO-C18 and EMC18@GO shows a bigger improvement than that of bulk EMC18 because of the framework role of 2D GO nanosheets. At 160 degrees C, no liquid leakage appears in EMC18@GO-C18, exhibiting a superior shape stabilization temperature to EMC18@GO, which is contributed by its enhanced interfacial compatibility from the introduced octadecyl side chains. Thermal performance shows a highly dependence upon the content of GO or GO-C18 nanofillers, and the thermal cycling stability reaches 500 times. Four thermal cycles are well repeated for the fabric coated by EMC18@GO-C18-2%, and no energy efficiency loses. The maximum temperature difference and thermal buffering time is -15 degrees C and 375 s at 70 degrees C working temperature. Good structure stabilization and thermal performance of EMC18 doped by GO-C18 offers a chance to approach the high-efficient thermal energy storage materials.

AB The shipping industry has been facing great pressure to become more sustainable, emanating from the increasingly stringent environmental regulations, fuel prices volatility and societal needs. As a result, a variety of technologies have been developed aiming to improve the environmental and economic performance of the modern ship energy systems, however leading to additional challenges for the technology selection during the design process. This study introduces an innovative method that integrates the economic and environmental aspects of sustainability to support decisions on the synthesis of the modem ship energy systems. The method includes a simulation model for predicting the energy systems performance during the ship lifetime. The genetic algorithm NSGA-II, is employed to solve the multi-objective combinatorial optimisation problem of selecting the integrated ship energy systems configuration. The derived results are visualised to reveal the Pareto front and the trade-offs among the objectives. The method is novel in supporting the synthesis of the integrated ship energy systems, as it includes both environmental and economic objectives, as well as evaluates the performance of the systems over an expected operational profile. The developed method is implemented for the case study of an Aframax oil tanker and the derived results analysis indicates that the ship energy systems sustainability can be improved by adopting LNG fuel and dual fuel engines technology, as well as by introducing other emerging technologies like fuel cells and carbon capture, although the latter is associated with a high cost. It is concluded that the inclusion of both environmental and economic objectives highlights the trade-offs between more environmentally friendly or cost efficient configurations, thus supporting the multi-objective decision-making process.

AB There is an ever growing demand for renewable sources of energy to replace conventional fossil fuels. One of the alternatives is usage of hydrogen production by electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Toward this end, we have successfully prepared a novel, robust electrocatalyst for HER containing Au nanoparticles dispersed on a natural bentonite using a simple one-pot reduction process. It is one of the most effective ways to minimize Au nanoparticle production cost, stability and usage.
   Bentonite clay was first modified using two coupling agents (mercaptosilane (MPS) or the diazonium salt of diphenyl aminoaniline (DPA)) to increase interlamellar spacing distance and to provide anchoring sites for the perfluorinated diazonium tetrachloroaurate (III) salt used as a unique source of zero-valent gold nanoparticles dispersed on bentonite surface. Successful intercalation was confirmed by the detection of Fls peak in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) at similar to 689 eV, in line with fluorine in C-F bonds, and the reduction of gold (III) into metallic gold. Both nanohybrids showed efficient electrochemical activity for HER in acidic condition (0.1 M H2SO4) with high current density up to -25 inA.cm(-2) at -1 V and 0.148 mV onset. Negligible decreasing in current density and slight shift in onset was observed after 1000 cycles. The results obtained so far open new avenues for the preparation of low cost, efficient and stable HER catalyst on the one hand, and will contribute to the knowledge of the surface chemistry of the diazonium salts, on the other hand.

AB In this study, the pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis characteristics of walnut shell and bio-oil distillation residue were investigated by means of thermogravimetric analysis followed by Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (TGA-FTIR). Multiple reaction models were employed to fit individual pyrolysis experiment of walnut shell and bio-oil distillation residue to find the optimal model for further analysis of co-pyrolysis. The results showed that the pyrolysis behavior of bio-oil distillation residue was different from that of walnut shell. Compared to the pyrolysis of walnut shell, bio-oil distillation residue retained more biochar and a relatively lower rate of mass loss. However, the best fitting models for walnut shell and bio-oil distillation residue were all five-reaction model through comparing the fitting effect and the component complexity. Moreover, five-reaction model was introduced to analyze the co-pyrolysis of walnut shell and bio-oil distillation residue, indicating that the co pyrolysis had good adaptability to five-reaction model. The thermal degradation of the co-pyrolysis shoulder and spike peaks could be accurately predicted. In addition, the gas products of bio-oil distillation residue and walnut shell had the same absorption band by infrared spectroscopy, indicating that the pyrolysis of two raw materials had similar products while the different absorption intensities represented different concentrations of gas products. Based on Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and Kissinger Akahira Sunose (KAS) methods, as the proportion of walnut shell in blend sample increased, the average activation energy gradually increased except for the pure walnut shell.

AB The present work shows a comparison between the levelized cost and the thermoeconomic methods in their application to assess the performance of a solar polygeneration plant. The aim is to analyze the costs allocation process, the unit specific costs of each product, as well as the energy and exergy efficiencies, which allows to identify the main advantages of both the evaluated methods. The methodology is applied in a case study configured by a concentrated solar power with thermal energy storage and backup system, combined to a multi-effect distillation plant, an absorption refrigeration plant, and a process heat module. The present study reveals that through the levelized cost method, the cost associated to the electricity generation is higher than it is by applying the thermoeconomic method, whereas the costs of water, cooling and process heat are significantly lower. Those differences represent an increase of about 35.1% in the case of the electricity, and a reduction in the cost associated to the water, cooling, and heat production by around 34.4%, 78.1%, and 97.6%, respectively. Results show that the thermoeconomic method is an equitable and rational cost allocation method which is suitable for a solar polygeneration plant. This method is recommended when a more precise analysis is required to assess the proper costs of different products, and for assessing the benefits of a polygeneration plant, when compared to stand-alone plants. However, the levelized cost method is a simple and fast method, and a deep knowledge of thermodynamics is not required, being recommended when in need to perform a first approach of the costs of each product.

AB Hydrogen peroxide is added into the anode methanol fuel as a pro-oxygenic agent to improve the electro-oxidation reaction rate of methanol in low-temperature direct methanol fuel cell. Cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and steady-state polarization with three-electrode system are used to test the catalytic efficiency with different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide additive. The mechanism of pro-oxygenic activity is revealed by cyclic voltammetry method. The results of electrochemical analysis show that the peak current density and peak power density are the highest when the concentration of hydrogen peroxide additive is 0.1 M at room temperature, increase 12.2% and 34.1% than those of pure methanol solution, respectively. The anode charge transfer resistances reduce gradually as the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide increase from 0 to 0.3 M. The tests under different temperature indicate that the promotion effect of hydrogen peroxide additive is significant at room temperature rather than at high temperature. The results show that hydrogen peroxide can be an effective pro-oxygenic agent for methanol electro-oxidation to improve the anode methanol electro-oxidation reaction of direct methanol fuel cell at room temperature.

AB In this study, exergetic, environmental and economic (3E) analyses have been performed in order to provide sustainability indicators from resource extraction to the final product of stationary power Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC) systems (500 kW). Two environmental life cycle impact assessment methods have been selected: the ReCiPe 2016 hierarchical midpoint and endpoint, and the Cumulative Exergy Extraction from the Natural Environment (CEENE). The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) under technology cost and performance parameters was calculated to analyze the system from the economic point of view. The global warming potential (GWP) is estimated to be 0.549 kg CO2-eq/kWh while acidification (5.06e - 4 kg SO2-eq/kWh), eutrophication (9.81e - 4 kg P-eq. freshwater/kWh), ozone layer depletion (4.11e - 6 kg CFC-11-eq/kWh) and human toxicity (1.07 kg 1,4-DB-eq/kWh). Aggregated CEENE was estimated to be about 8.55 MJ(ex)/kWh. Results show that majority of impacts are dominated by fuel supply, while some others are dominated by manufacturing of system. GWP is the only impact category dominated by system operation. Due to potentially high electrical efficiency, MCFC energy systems can lead to lower CEENE and improvements of global warming, fossil fuel and resource scarcity, and photochemical oxidant formation potential with respect to other conventional energy conversion systems. Advances in longer lifetimes of the MCFC stack can help trigger innovation in manufacturing processes and will lead to less resource use of electricity, metal, and minerals, thus less resource scarcity and toxicity related burdens. The baseline LCOE is calculated 0.1265 (sic)/kWh being comparable with the Italian grid (0.15-0.16 (sic)/kWh). The costing results indicate that the unit decreasing the system capital cost could potentially reduce the LCOE by around 25%. Advancing the use of life-cycle thinking in MCFC industry with site-specific data raise systems credibility and enables clarifying the trade-offs between the sustainability pillars, thus designing more sustainable products.

AB Oxygen carrier (OC) plays an important role in the successful operation of chemical looping process. A detailed understanding of the structural evolution of the materials is crucial to design high performance OCs for this technology. In this study, Fe2O3 particles were used as oxygen carrier to investigate the morphology and microstructure changes induced by redox reaction during chemical looping process, which were performed in the single and multiple redox cycles. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Hg intrusion method and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to characterize the changes in phase composition, pore size distribution and morphology.
   Our results indicated that the surface area of Fe2O3 particles decreased during the redox cycles even though more macro-pores ( > 1000 nm) formed for these particles. Sintering was attributed to the surface area decrease of Fe2O3 particles in the redox process. Because of the outward Fe cation diffusion, porous structure in the interior of Fe2O3 particles was formed, which led to the crushing strength of the OC particles decreased significantly. In the reduction process, the aggregation of unstable Fe2O3 could cause the surface sintering of OC particles in the transformation of Fe2O3 into Fe2O3. Such findings can not only explain the performance of iron based OCs in redox reaction, but can also provide theoretical guidance for the synthesis of iron-based OCs.

AB In this paper, thermodynamic and thermoeconomic analyses, and also optimization of an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) were performed. The system was adapted to an existing solid waste power plant with a 5.66 MW installed power capacity in order to produce additional power from the exhaust gas. The actual operating data of the plant were utilized during all stages of the analyses. The originality of this paper is based on the analysis of the possibility of the energy conversion of an exhaust gas with a temperature of 566 degrees C into the electricity by utilizing an ORC system in the concept of waste-to-energy. Four different working fluids: toluene, octamethyltrisiloxane (MDM), octamethyl cyclotetrasiloxane (D4) and n-decane were considered and analyzed for the current system. This is also another novelty of this study due to lack of such a study, in the open literature, that deals with an ORC utilized for a typical municipal solid waste power plant. According to the thermoeconomic analyses, toluene was found to be the optimum working fluid with the maximum power output of 584.6 kW and the exergy efficiency of 15.69%. The optimization of the cycle was performed by using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm method (NSGA-II) in MATLAB software environment. The optimization results were compared and the deviations of the net power output and the total cost rate were evaluated as -5.89%, -3.51 $/h for toluene; 0.96%, -3.60 $/h for MDM; 8.45%, -2.04 $/h for D4 and 2.00%, -5.54 $/h for n-decane, respectively.

AB Solar cooling is one of the most promising technologies for covering the increasing needs of our society with a clean and sustainable way. This paper examines an ejector-absorption cooling system operating with the LiBr-H2O working pair which is driven by parabolic trough solar collectors. The main objective of this investigation is to optimize the total solar cooling system and to compare it with the respective optimum system with conventional absorption chiller and parabolic trough collectors. The generator temperature and pressure, as well as the pressure drop in the ejector, are the optimization parameters, while the maximization of the system performance is the objective function. According to the final results, the system with the ejector leads to higher COP (coefficient of performance) for the majority of the examined operating scenarios. Moreover, the optimized ejector-absorption system presents performance enhancement up to 60.9% compared to the conventional absorption system for the case with 12.5 degrees C evaporating temperature and 30 degrees C condenser temperature. For this optimum case, the system COP is about 1.01, the chiller COP is 1.65 and the system exergy efficiency is 4.76%. Generally, the system COP is ranged from 0.473 to 1.01 for the system with ejector, while the demanded specific collecting area from 0.987 to 2.11 m(2)/kW(cooling). The analysis is performed with a developed model in Engineering Equation Solver which is validated with literature results.

AB A comparative analysis is performed for three different layouts of SOFC-GT hybrid systems with internal reformer from the viewpoints of energy, exergy, environmental and economic. The three considered designs are distinguished by number of SOFC stack, as single SOFC stack is employed in one system, while two SOFC stacks (cell numbers halved) are used for the other designs. For the second system, two stacks are fed by fuel and air in parallel way; however, in the third case, two stacks are fed by fuel in parallel and air serially. A mathematical model is developed in EES software to simulate the performance of the cycles through a parametric study. In addition, exergy destruction rate of components of the plants are achieved to recognize the main sources of ireversibilities. The analyses demonstrated that two-stack SOFC-GT series type is more efficient, leading energy and exergy efficiencies to reach 63.22% and 60.81% correspondingly, which are about 20.3% and 8.89% higher than conventional SOFC-GT and parallel type, respectively. The highest source of exergy destruction amongst all system components belongs to after burner. Furthermore, it is observed that the highest total cost, 24.95 $/h, is attributed to conventional SOFC-GT hybrid system while the least amount corresponds to SOFC-GT series type, 18.5 $/h. The CO2 gas emission obtained for two-stack SOFC-GT hybrid system series type, 313.3 kg/MWh, obtained to be the lowest.

AB This study attempts to evaluate the flow, heat transfer and second law characteristics of a hybrid nanofluid containing graphene-silver nanoparticles inside two new microchannel heat sinks. The temperature dependent thermophysical properties are employed in the simulations. Because the flow is divided uniformly between the channels of heat sinks, a rather uniform temperature distribution is obtained on the heating surface. By increasing either velocity or concentration at both heat sinks, the surface temperature reduces; the cooling uniformity improves; and the maximum temperature also decreases which reduces the possibility of hot spot formation. Moreover, increase of the velocity or concentration intensifies the pumping power in both heat sinks. Figure of merit, i.e. the ratio of heat transfer enhancement to pressure drop increment in the case of using the nanofluid instead of pure water, shows a greater value for the heat sink with more path changes. The results reveal that the heat transfer has a greater contribution in the entropy generation compared to the friction. Moreover, greater fraction of thermal entropy generated in the heat sinks occurs in the fluid part. Based on the results obtained, it is found that employing the heat sink with more path changes and also using the nanofluid as heat transfer fluid can be promising options to be utilized in electronics cooling regarding both first and second laws of thermodynamics.

AB The demand for water and electricity is gradually increasing throughout the years due to the modern lifestyle of humans to complete their daily activities. To make sustainable water and to produce electricity, the proposed experiment was done. In this, hybrid PV/T active solar still was designed and fabricated in which a solar PV powered Peltier system was incorporated. The Peltier used in this still helps in the enhancement of the distilled water production during both evaporation and condensation processes. Various investigations were made on the proposed active hybrid PV/T system to claim this as the best and it was succeeded. Finally, the proposed active hybrid solar PV/T still produces about 30% higher efficiency than the conventional passive still and also resulted in 38% improved efficiency than the actual solar PV system.

AB The synthesis of a shape stable paraffin/SiO2 composite PCM, for use in latent heat storage, comprised of distinct nanospheres, using a novel and simple chemically aided infiltration method was investigated and the produced samples were characterized. SiO2 spheres were synthesized, with the sol-gel method, and then used to encapsulate paraffin wax using several different preparation ratios of paraffin to SiO2. The samples' constitution and morphology were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used for the paraffin mass percentage determination. The results were indicative of paraffin encapsulation inside the porous network of the SiO2 spheres. DSC was used to investigate the thermophysical properties of the composite samples and for their evaluation as PCMs. The sample with the highest encapsulation ratio (B4 at 78.15%) had a paraffin mass percentage of 80% and a latent heat of similar to 156 J/g. The encapsulation's influence on paraffin's thermal properties was investigated and an optimum preparation ratio was determined. The composite nanoparticles retained a large amount of the paraffin's latent heat while showing no signs of aggregation-a novelty for paraffin/SiO2 nanoPCM- and presenting enhancements that make them promising materials for heat storage applications (LHTES).

AB Thermochemical energy storage is a promising technology which helps to address intermittent problems of energy sources in renewable energy technologies, in particular concentrated solar thermal plants. Compared to latent and sensible energy storage which have been extensively studied, thermochemical energy storage is still at its early development stage yet it is featured with a much greater energy storage density and limitless storage duration. Among various thermochemical energy storage technologies, metal oxides redox energy storage inherits a wide range of advantages, for instance, high-temperature operation, using air as both the reactant and heat transfer medium, and simple products separation due to gas solid reactions. Over the past 40 years, an increasing number of studies on the performance of the metal-oxides-based energy storage systems have been carried out. Therefore, the present review aims to make a detailed summary of that valuable knowledge and experience in this technical area. More specifically, high-temperature redox energy storage systems including pure and mixed metal oxides systems were reviewed. Design characteristics including operating temperature, energy storage density, reversibility, kinetics, economics and reactor selection and development for various types of redox systems were summarized and discussed in details. It should be noted that the current work is limited to metal oxides redox systems using air as the reactant and the applications of metal oxides redox systems in other areas such as chemical looping are not included.

AB In this paper, we proposed and experimentally validated a vibration-based multimodal hybrid piezoelectric-electromagnetic energy harvester having multiple mechanical degrees-of-freedom. This multimodal hybrid energy harvester (MHEH) has a unique design, which helps it to achieve multiple close resonant modes of vibration in a certain frequency range. Using a low-spring-stiffness material (polyacrylate) as a substrate assists MHEH in reducing the higher resonant frequencies into a low frequency range. The two combined conversion mechanisms (piezoelectric-electromagnetic) are exploited to obtain higher output power from low input accelerations at ambient vibrations. The finite element method simulation model is employed to predict and optimize the mode shapes of the proposed MHEH for different vibration modes. The simulation and experimental result imply that the proposed MHEH can operate at four resonant modes of vibration in the range of 12-22 Hz, which are concentrated around 12, 15, 17, and 22 Hz. An MHEH prototype is fabricated, where four lead-zirconate-titanate elements are used as piezoelectric materials, and NdFeB magnets with conductive coils are used as electromagnetic parts in the same system. Here, a single piezoelectric generator can produce a maximum of 250.23 mu W of power across an optimum load of 90 K Omega at the 3rd resonant mode (17 Hz) under 0.4 g (3.92 ms(-2)) acceleration. On the other hand, a single electromagnetic generator can deliver a maximum power of 244.17 mu W to a 10 Omega optimum load under the same conditions.

AB The use of phytohormones in microalgal biofuel production is gaining interest due to their substantial effect on biomass and lipid enrichment under standard and nitrogen-limited conditions. In the present study, the collaborative effect of combination of selected phytohormones viz. zeatin (Z), indole acetic acid (IAA), and gibberellic acid (GA) was studied to optimize biomass and lipid production in microalga Acutodesmus obliquus under nitrogen-limitation using response surface methodology (RSM). Significantly higher biomass and lipid productivity was obtained with the supplementation of combination of Z (0.5 mg L-1), IAA (1.0 mg L-(1)), and GA (5.0 mg L-1) under nitrogen-limitation with 49.07% and 77.20% increase respectively as compared to optimized nitrogen control (ON). Zeatin was found to be the most significantly influencing phytohormone followed by GA in RSM data analysis. Present study elucidated the synergistic effect of combination of exogenous phytohormones in enhancing biomass and lipid productivity under nitrogen-limitation for microalgal biofuel production.

AB Comparative analysis on off-design performance of a transcritical CO2 (tCO(2)) power cycle by different operation methods is conducted in this paper. The studied cycle is based on printed circuit heat exchangers (PCHEs) and a radial turbine with adjustable stator blades. A novel method for the optimal operation is proposed to obtain its maximal net power at given parameters of geothermal water. The optimal operation method is found by adjusting control variables including the evaporating pressure and the outlet angle of the adjustable stator. This paper compares the constant pressure operation method based on the adjustable stator, the optimal operation method, and the sliding pressure operation method. The results indicate that the ranges of control variables are narrower by the optimal operation method than by the sliding pressure operation method or by the constant pressure operation method. When the inlet temperature of geothermal water is fixed at the design value (125 degrees C), the method for optimal operation could generate 15.07% at most more net power than the sliding pressure operation method does and 3.49% more net power than the constant pressure operation method does at studied mass flow rate ratios of geothermal water. The increase of the net power per unit inlet temperature of geothermal water results in an increase of 1.19-1.98% by the optimal operation method compared with the net power at the design point.

AB A theoretical study is introduced to predict the hydrodynamic performance of a vertical axis Savonius turbine with semicircular vanes. This theory is based on the concept of stagnation pressure rise at the turbine vanes and Newton's second law of impulse momentum principle. The present theory predicts the performance of a Savonius rotor with semicircular vane including overlapping vanes. Although the present model is derived for semicircular vanes, it can also be used for any type of the vanes with minor modifications.
   For the validation of an investigated theory, the results obtained by the presented theory is compared with the experimental results available in the published literatures. The comparison of the results are done for two major cases of the Savonius turbine, i. Turbine with an end plate and ii. Turbine without end plates for low aspect ratio. The calculation shows that, the theoretically calculated results predicts the maximum power within 3.6% and maximum coefficient of power within 6.67% variation.
   It can be conclude that the present theory will be most useful to decide the best design configurations of Savonius turbine unit for specific available flow conditions and quick performance prediction of a Savonius turbine for different operating conditions.

AB Prognostics and health management can improve the reliability and safety of transportation systems. Data collected from diverse sources provide a chance and at the same time a challenge for data-driven PHM methods and models. The data often exhibit challenging characteristics like imbalanced data on normal and faulty conditions, noise and outliers, data points of different importance for the data-driven model, etc. In this paper, a k nearest neighbors-based fuzzy support vector machine is proposed for reducing the computational burden and tackling the issue of imbalance and outlier data, in fault detection. Fault detection is mathematically a classification problem. In this paper, the reverse nearest neighbors technique is adopted for detecting outliers and the k nearest neighbors technique is used to identify the borderline points for defining the classification hyperplane in support vector machines. Considering the position of each data point and the distribution of its nearest neighbors, a new method is proposed for calculating their estimation error costs. The proposed method is verified by comparison with several benchmark methods on five public datasets. Then, a real case study concerning fault detection in a braking system of a high-speed train is considered. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Identifying influential individuals who lead to faster and wider spreading of influence in social networks is of theoretical significance and practical value to either accelerating the speed of propagation in the case of product promotion, or hindering the pace of diffusion involved in rumors. Conventional methods, ranging from centrality indices to diffusion-based processes, already take into account the number and influences of followers, but fail to make full use of the characteristics of social media. A novel approach called PartitionRank for finding a pre-fixed number of influential individuals in microblogging scenarios is proposed in this study to maximize the impact; it combines interest similarity with social interaction between users via graph partitioning. Experimental results on artificial and real-world microblogging networks illustrate that our scheme outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods in effectiveness and efficiency.

AB Migrating Birds Optimisation (MBO) is a nature-inspired approach which has been shown to be very effective when solving a variety of combinatorial optimisation problems. More recently, an adaptation of the algorithm has been proposed that enables it to deal with continuous search spaces. We extend this work in two ways. Firstly, a novel leader replacement strategy is proposed to counter the slow convergence of the existing MBO algorithms due to low selection pressure. Secondly, MBO is hybridised with adaptive neighbourhood operators borrowed from Differential Evolution (DE) that promote exploration and exploitation. The new variants are tested on two sets of continuous large scale optimisation problems. Results show that MBO variants using adaptive, exploration-based operators outperform De on the CEC benchmark suite with 1000 variables. Further experiments on a second suite of 19 problems show that MBO variants outperform DE on 90% of these test-cases. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cloud computing is one of today's most popular and important IT trends. Currently, most organizations use cloud computing services (public or private) as part of their computer infrastructure. Virtualization technology is at the core of cloud computing, and virtual resources, such as virtual servers, are commonly used to provide services to the entire organization. Due to their importance and prevalence, virtual servers in an organizational cloud are constantly targeted by cyber-attackers who try to inject malicious code or malware into the server (e.g., ransomware). Many times, server administrators are not aware that the server has been compromised, despite the presence of detection solutions on the server (e.g., antivirus engine). In other cases, the breach is detected after a long period of time when significant damage has already occurred. Thus, detecting that a virtual server has been compromised is extremely important for organizational security. Existing security solutions that are installed on the server (e.g., antivirus) are considered untrusted, since malware (particularly sophisticated ones) can evade them. Moreover, these tools are largely incapable of detecting new unknown malware. Machine learning (ML) methods have been shown to be effective at detecting malware in various domains. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for trusted detection of ransomware in virtual servers on an organization's private cloud. We conducted trusted analysis of volatile memory dumps taken from a virtual machine (memory forensics), using the Volatility framework, and created general descriptive meta-features. We leveraged these meta-features, using machine learning algorithms, for the detection of unknown ransomware in virtual servers. We evaluated our methodology extensively in five comprehensive experiments of increasing difficulty, on two different popular servers (IIS server and an email server). We used a collection of real-world, professional, and notorious ransomware and a collection of legitimate programs. The results show that our methodology is able to detect anomalous states of a virtual machine, as well as the presence of both known and unknown ransomware, obtaining the following results: TPR =1, FPR= 0.052, F-measure = 0.976, and AUC= 0.966, using the Random Forest classifier. Finally, we showed that our proposed methodology is also capable of detecting an additional type of malware known as a remote access Trojan (RAT), which is used to attack organizational VMs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Home Health Care (HHC) companies are widespread in European countries and aim to serve patients at home to help them recover from illness and injury in a personal environment. Since transportation costs constitute one of the largest forms of expenditure in the HHC industry, it is of importance to research the optimization of the HHC logistics. This paper considers an HHC routing problem with stochastic travel and service times, which comes from the logistics practice of HHC companies. A Stochastic Programming model with Recourse (SPR model) is proposed based on the specific structure of the supply chain. Three series of experiments are carried out to evaluate the model. Firstly, the SPR model is reduced to the deterministic one, and five approaches (Gurobi Solver, Hybrid Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Bat Algorithm and Firefly Algorithm) are respectively implemented to solve the deterministic model. The SPR model is finally solved by the proposed SA-based heuristic algorithm. Evaluation of the solutions achieved by the two models highlights the advantages of considering stochastic travel and service times. Finally, a case study is given to explain how the SPR model works for an HHC company. This research will help HHC companies to make appropriate decisions when planning their vehicle routes.

AB A good trade-off between exploration and exploitation to find optimal values in search algorithms is very hard to achieve. On the other hand, the combination of search methods may cause computational complexity increase problems. The Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) is a swarm optimization algorithm based on the law of gravity, where the solution search process depends on the velocity of particles. The application of intelligent techniques can improve the search performances of GSA. This paper proposes the design of a Neuro and Fuzzy Gravitational Search Algorithm (NFGSA) to achieve better results than GSA in terms of global optimum search capability and convergence speed, without increasing the computational complexity. Both the algorithms have the same computational complexity O(nd), where n is the number of agents and d is the search space dimension. The main task of the designed intelligent system is to adjust a GSA parameter on a revised version of GSA. NFGSA is compared with GSA, a Plane Surface Gravitational Search Algorithm (PSGSA) and a Modified Gravitational Search Algorithm (MGSA). The results show that NFGSA improves the optimization performances of GSA and PSGSA, without adding computational costs. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is better than MGSA for a benchmark function and achieves similar results for two test functions. The analysis on the computational complexity shows that NFGSA has a better computational complexity than MGSA, because NFGSA has complexity O(nd), whereas MGSA has complexity O((nd)(2)).

AB In the US, the demand for outpatient services is expected to increase, while the supply of physicians to provide the care is projected to decrease. Besides, inefficiencies in the appointment system (AS) and patient no-shows (patients who do not arrive for scheduled appointments) reduce provider productivity, timely access to care, and cost the U.S. healthcare system more than $150 billion a year. To handle increasing demand and compensate for patient no-shows, outpatient clinics tend to overbook appointments. The current scheduling practice at most clinics and majority of the scheduling rules proposed in the literature assume all patients are equally likely to miss an appointment. Further, most scheduling rules in the literature do not make use of the available data, such as electronic health records, when scheduling patients. This paper proposes a prescriptive analytics framework to improve the performance of an AS with respect to patient satisfaction (measured using average patient waiting time and number of patients unable to get an appointment for the day under consideration) and resource utilization (measured using average resource idle time, overflow time and overtime). In the proposed framework, patient-related data from various sources are used to develop predictive models that identify the risk of a patient no-show. Different scheduling rules, that leverage the patient-specific no-show risk is then proposed. A case study, with real data from a Family Medicine Clinic in Pennsylvania, is used to show the feasibility of the proposed framework. The effectiveness of the proposed scheduling rules is evaluated by benchmarking it with three rules adapted from the literature. The results indicate that the proposed scheduling rules consistently outperform the benchmark rules for all the clinic settings tested. Further, the proposed framework is generic and can be adopted by any outpatient clinic characterized by occurrences of no-shows and appointment-based customer arrivals. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study focussed on the formulation, characterisation of lemon myrtle (LM) and anise myrtle (AM) essential oil (EO) in water nanoemulsion and their antibacterial activity. The required hydrophilic lipophilic balance (rHLB) value of LM EO and AM EO was 14 and 12, respectively. The Central Composite Rotatable Design (CCRD) model produces the smallest droplet size and polydispersity index (PDI) for LMEO (d approximate to 16.07 nm; PDI approximate to 0.209) and AMEO (d approximate to 30.23 nm; PDI approximate to 0.216) at 1% EO and 10% surfactant mixture (Smix) ratio using ultrasonication for 5 min. Whereas, increased in EO, decrease in Smix concentrations and ultrasonication time produces higher droplet size of nanoemulsions. LMEO (LM-15, LM-17) nanoemulsions was clear and transparent compared to AMEO (AM-15, AM-17). All the selected nanoemulsions showed good stability at 4, 25 and 40 degrees C during storage, except LM-15 at 40 degrees C. LMEO nanoemulsion showed enhanced antibacterial activity compared to LMEO alone (P < 0.05).

AB Demands for anthocyanin-rich ingredients are steadily growing due to their positive functions in human health and food coloration. Commercially available purple wheat was evaluated as a source of functional ingredients based on anthocyanin composition and antioxidant properties. Anthocyanins were concentrated in the bran fraction by about 2-fold and then the bran was further processed into anthocyanin-rich powder using ethanol extraction and column purification. Batch studies showed that anthocyanin concentration factor increased by about 81- to 135-fold in the powder depending on batch size. Characterization of anthocyanins with a triple quad mass spectrometry showed a complex anthocyanin profile with 5 pigments making up 93-96% of the total anthocyanin content. These pigments were cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-(6-malonyl glucoside), cyanidin-3-rutinoside, peonidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-(6-malonylglucoside) but their concentrations varied between bran and powder. The purple wheat bran and powder exhibited exceptional antioxidant capacity based on scavenging of DPPH, ABTS and peroxyl radicals holding a promise as functional ingredients.

AB Flesh reddening of 'Friar' plum (Prunus salicina Lindl.) fruit developed rapidly during storage at intermediate temperatures of 5 and 15 degrees C in comparison to flesh turning yellow at 25 degrees C and almost no colour change at 0 degrees C. Thus, modifications of phytochemicals and antioxidant activity during flesh reddening were investigated. Anthocyanins accumulated rapidly in reddening flesh tissue and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside was identified as the absolutely predominant individual anthocyanin. Anthocyanins contributed greatly to the antioxidant activity at 5 degrees C, and especially at 15 degrees C by combining with non-anthocyanin phenolics, including protocatechuic, syringic, trans-p-coumaric and caffeic acids. Storage at 15 degrees C impeded the hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose and fructose, while storage at 5 degrees C maintained sucrose and accumulated fructose. Intermediate temperatures altered organic acid compositions helping to produce reasonable SSC/TA ratios. These results would provide a postharvest approach for fruit to meet the consumer's demand for diverse tastes and health promoting effects.

AB Two samples of trout frame protein hydrolysates were prepared by Microwave Pretreatment followed by Conventional Enzymatic hydrolysis (MPCE) and Non-Pretreated followed by Microwave-assisted Enzymatic hydrolysis (NPME), respectively, were subjected to simulated gastrointestinal digestion. Changes on degree of hydrolysis, antioxidant activity, molecular weight, and amino acid composition between undigested and after gastrointestinal digestion of peptides were investigated. Comparing to undigested peptides, a breakdown of MPCE and NPME into smaller molecules was observed. Degree of hydrolysis, ABTS%+ radical scavenging activity and reducing power increased (P < 0.05) for both samples after gastrointestinal digestion. A purified peptide from GI-MPCE had two possible sequences, NGRLGYSEGVM or GNRLGYSWDD (1182.65 Da). Whereas GI-NPME had two peptides IRGPEEHMHR or RVAPEEHMHR (1261.77 Da) and SAGVPRHK or SARPRHK (962.63 Da). These results indicate that digested hydrolysates can be a rich source of antioxidants. Isolated peptides extracted from trout frame by-products could be new food ingredients used as natural antioxidants.

AB Two water soluble polysaccharides components PAPS-1 and PAPS-2 with homogeneously distributed molecular weight were obtained from Prunus avium. PAPS-1 and PAPS-2 contained GalA: Ara: Gal: Rha: GluA: Glu in 49.38: 32.39: 10.68: 4.66: 1.94: 0.48 and 77.18: 14.91: 3.39: 3.46: 0.93: 0.19M ratios respectively, as well as trace amount of mannose and fucose. Infrared spectroscopy (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and methylation analysis indicated that both fractions were type I rhamnogalacturonan (RG-I) pectic polysaccharides with glycan side chains constituted mainly of arabinose with minor amount of galactose. Galacturonic acid methylation and sugar acetylation was found in both PAPS-1 and PAPS-2. Both PAPS-1 and PAPS-2 significantly induced the NO release from RAW264.7 cells and the expression of several immune-related molecular (TNF alpha, IL6, IL10, GCSF, iNOS, COX-2) was induced in RAW264.7 cells.

AB Saffron, used in cookery as a flavouring and colouring agent, is well-known for its antioxidant and beneficial health properties. In the present work, the effect of saffron addition (0-control, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4%, w/w) in the formulation of fresh pasta was evaluated on textural, physical-chemical, and sensory properties of the cooked product. Content and retention of the bioactive molecules of saffron (crocins) were evaluated by HPLC along with the corresponding antioxidant activity of enriched pasta. The presence of saffron significantly influenced textural and physical-chemical properties of pasta. Higher saffron concentrations enhanced the antioxidant activity of pasta with the higher values of crocins in samples enriched with 0.4% saffron extract even after 3 min of cooking (4.23-5.06 mg/g db). Sensory analysis showed an increased acceptability of the saffron enriched pasta for all descriptors selected (visual aspect, colour, aroma, taste, chewiness, hardness, gumminess and overall acceptability).

AB The effects of gamma-ray irradiation and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) on watercress (Nasturtium officinale R. Br.) phenolic compounds were evaluated after 7-day storage at 4 degrees C. Irradiation doses of 1, 2 and 5 kGy were tested, as well as vacuum-packaging and MAP enriched with 100% N-2 and Ar. A non-irradiated, air-packaged control was included in all experiments. p-Coumaric acid was the most abundant compound in fresh watercress, followed by quercetin-3-O-sophoroside and isorhamnetin-O-hydroxyferuloylhexoside-O-hexoside. Four kaempferol glycoside derivatives were identified for the first time in this species. In general, flavonoids predominated over phenolic acids. Samples stored under vacuum and irradiated at 2 kGy revealed lower phenolic levels. Ar-enriched MAP and control conditions preserved the initial phenolic content. The 5 kGy dose also maintained concentrations of flavonoids and total phenolic compounds, but increased the phenolic acids content. Additionally, flavonoids were found strongly correlated to DPPH% scavenging activity and beta-carotene bleaching inhibition capacity.

AB Organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) are widely used in agricultural production but cause serious pollution. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) has been implemented to enhance the degradation of OPPs. Deciphering the structural and energetic determinants of OPPs-ALP interaction harbors the potential to understand key biodegradation processes of pesticides at the molecular level. With this aim, the binding modes of OPPs and ALP were studied using computational methods as molecular docking. The CASTp server was used to predict the active site residues. The Discovery Studio Visualizer was used for docking analysis. The results show that OPPs have high binding affinities to ALP with the free energy in the range of-7.68 to-4.06 Kcal mol(-1) . OPPs and ALP mainly form hydrogen bonds, and amino acid residues, Gln375, Asp55, and Thr413 play important roles in the catalysis process. The experimental data of the OPPs instability in the ALP system is consistent with the binding energy.

AB Myrosinase is a glycosylated enzyme present in the Brassicaceae family that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucoraphanin to yield sulforaphane, recognized as a health-promoting compound found in cruciferous foods. Broccoli myrosinase has been poorly characterized. In this work, the enzyme was purified from broccoli florets and its kinetic behaviour was analyzed. The cDNA of broccoli myrosinase was isolated and sequenced to obtain the amino acids sequence of the enzyme. A three-dimensional structural model of a broccoli myrosinase subunit was built and used to perform molecular docking simulations with glucoraphanin and other glucosinolates. Kinetic data were adjusted to the Two-Binding Sites Model that describes substrate inhibition, obtaining R-2 higher than 97%. The docking simulations confirmed the existence of two substrate-binding sites in the monomer, and allowed identifying the residues that interact with the substrate in each site. Our findings will help to design strategies to better exploit the health-promoting properties of broccoli.

AB Food adulteration is a serious issue that requires verification and strict management due to healthcare, morality, and social value problems. In the context of fat, food manufacturers blend lard with vegetable oils or animal fats for convenience and gaining economic benefits. Thus, we herein report the classification of 4 animal fats, e.g., beef tallow, pork lard, chicken fat, duck oil, using Raman spectroscopy combined with simple calculation of intensity ratios of Raman signal at vibrational modes corresponding to unsaturated fatty acids and total fatty acids. Various calculated values of the species were compared to find a feature that is able to classify each fats using Raman peak ratio. As a result, we suggested "Oil gauge (OG)" as a standard feature for classification of the fats in Raman analysis field. Furthermore, a quantification of the lard in other fat was accomplished with good linear correlation using the OG values.

AB The aim was to determine the mycotoxin transfer rate into beer during a semi-industrial production process and the effect of fungicide treatment in the field on mycotoxins concentrations in beer. To ensure the usual practical agronomical conditions, sample A was treated with fungicide Prosaro((R)) 250, and sample B was infected with Fusarium culmorum spores, in order to obtain infected malt. Malt was produced using standard procedure and beer was produced in a semi-industrial unit. During fermentation measurement of sugars (maltotriose and maltose), glycerol and ethanol content was performed on a daily basis. Multiple toxins were determined in malt and beer. Deoxynivalenol ( DON), its modified plant metabolite DON-3-glucoside (DON-glucoside), brevianamide F, tryptophol, linamarin, lotaustralin, culmorin (CUL), 15-hydroxy-CUL and 5-hydroyx-CUL were detected in all samples. Results indicate that F. culmorum infection did not influence the fermentation process or the alcohol concentration.

AB Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni leaves are a natural source of diterpenic glycosides, and various bioactive compounds. The objectives were to characterize antioxidants and steviol glycosides in the extracts obtained from Stevia after "green" pressurized hot water extraction (PHWE). PHWE extracts were obtained at different temperatures (100, 130, 160 degrees C); static extraction times (5 and 10 min), and cycle numbers (1, 2, 3) using a constant pressure of 10.34 MPa. Temperature was the most important parameter for extraction, where the highest recoveries of all bioactive compounds (except for carotenoids) were at 160 degrees C. Extracts obtained at longer static times had more steviol glycosides, condensed tannins, and chlorophyll A. Higher amounts of total phenols, condensed tannins, and steviol glycosides were obtained under higher cycle numbers. This study indicated that PHWE is useful for recovering polar and nonpolar antioxidants and steviol glycosides. PHWE may be a suitable technique for scale-up to industrial applications.

AB We used a pulsed electric field (PEF) to treat four pentapeptides with similar amino acid sequences (KCHKP, KCHQP, QCHKP, and QCHQP). We then evaluated antioxidant activity of the pentapeptides according to ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity. Structures of the peptides were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), mid-infrared (MIR), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The results indicated that antioxidant activities of KCHQP and QCHKP were increased by PEF, whereas those of KCHKP and QCHQP were reduced. The basic structures and functional groups of peptides were unaffected. PEF treatment reduced the alpha-helix contents of KCHQP and QCHKP, but increased those of KCHKP and QCHQP. Moreover, the chemical shifts at 14.46 ppm, 8.22 ppm, 7.87 ppm, 7.24 ppm, and 6.13 ppm attributable to hydrogen atoms of QCHKP shifted to the right, but the active hydrogens of QCHQP were not affected by PEF.

AB This work aimed to evaluate the effects of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma on inactivation of spoilage yeast Zygosaccharomyces rouxii (Z. rouxii), in apple juice. Results showed that DBD plasma treatment at 90 W for 140 s resulted in about 5-log reduction of Z. rouxii in apple juice. The levels of extracellular nucleic acids and proteins as well as contents of H2O2 and NO2- in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium increased significantly after DBD plasma treatment at 90 W for 40-200 s. The increases in membrane permeability and generation of reactive species would likely contribute to DBD plasma-mediated inactivation of Z. rouxii. DBD plasma caused significant changes in pH, titratable acidity, and certain color parameters of apple juice, but had no effect on the contents of total soluble solids, reducing sugar, and total phenolics. This study provides key implications for the application of DBD plasma in fruit juice processing.

AB UiO-67, a bifunctional adsorbent, was successfully applied to remove illegal food dyes (Congo red and Malachite green) from aqueous solution. The relevant adsorption conditions were optimized: pH 6, 120 min for contact time, and 10.0 mg L-1 adsorbent dose for Congo red. Adsorption behavior of UiO-67 exhibits a better fitting to pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir model. Moreover, the maximum adsorption capacities of Congo red (1236.9 mg g(-1)) and Malachite green (357.3 mg g(-1)) are higher than that of the most reported adsorbents. Thermodynamic analysis reveals that adsorption processes are spontaneous and endothermic in nature. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns, Fourier-transform infrared spectra and the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicates Zr-OH groups have positive influence on binding of target molecules. What's more, UiO-67 could be reused without significant loss of its capacity after seven cycles. These results prefigure the promising potentials of UiO-67 in food safety risk management.

AB The present study examined heavy metal contamination in six edible wild mushroom species obtained from twenty-one stations in Turkey's Black Sea region. Heavy metals were analyzed ICP-MS. Concentrations of cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, lead and zinc were measured in the ranges of 0.08-3.37, 0.01-2.50, 0.36-6.26, 17.5-122, 97.2-3919, 4.61-102, 12.7-24.2, 0.15-1.80 and 34.4-225 mg/kg, respectively. The highest metal was iron in all of the examined species from the stations; and differences among metal levels across all of stations were found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). Moreover, the maximum provisional tolerable weekly intake limits for edible mushroom species was calculated and assessed for the purpose of human health.

AB Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a bioactive polyphenolic compound obtained from propolis extract. Although it has a broad therapeutic potential, the bioavailability of CAPE is limited, due to reduced solubility and poor plasmatic stability. Efforts to reduce these pharmacokinetic drawbacks resulted in the synthesis of caffeic acid phenethyl amide (CAPA). Cyclodextrins have been proved as promising excipients for the formulation of active ingredients. Herein, we report the inclusion complexation behavior and binding ability of CAPE and CAPA with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD). The supramolecular interactions were examined through UV and FTIR spectroscopy, DSC, H-1 NMR and 2D ROESY. The CAPE/HP-beta-CD and CAPA/HP-beta-CD inclusion complexes stability constants were determined to be, respectively, 2911.6 and 584.6 M-1 in water and 2866.2 and 700.1 M-1 at physiological pH. The aqueous solubility increased notably, proving that HP-beta-CD can be potentially useful to improve the biological, chemical and physical properties of CAPE and CAPA.

Total anthocyanins, carotenoids (CA), ascorbic acid (AA), phenolic compounds (PC), total flavonoids, antioxidant activity, color, moisture, water activity, solubility, hygroscopicity and microstructure of the powders were analyzed. The acerola residue extract had higher concentrations of bioactive compounds (except for AA) and lower antioxidant activity. The microencapsulated powders by spray and freeze-drying showed good physico-chemical properties. Spray-dried powder has lower microencapsulation efficiency for CA, AA and PC and in general, it presented the best characteristics due to its higher concentration of bioactive compounds (except AA), and antioxidant activity by FRAP and ORAC assays. The spray-dried particles were of spherical shape while the freeze-dried products were of irregular structures. Overall, these results demonstrate the better utility of agro-industrial acerola residue in the form of microparticles of bioactive compounds, retaining good antioxidant activity.

AB Animal and aquatic meats represent important sources of dietary protein and micro-nutrients. Although red and processed meats carry some risks for human health, sensory and nutritional advantages drive meat consumption. Therefore, it is important to understand how meat processing and cooking influence healthiness. The research aim was to investigate relationships of meat composition (proximates, amino acids and minerals) and cooking conditions (raw, 90 s microwave, 200 degrees C oven for 10 or 30 min) on protein digestibility, for a selection of four animal (beef, chicken, pork, kangaroo) and four aquatic meats (salmon, trout, prawn, oyster). Lean meats were minced before cooking followed by in vitro gastro-intestinal digestion and analysed for progress of hydrolysis, and size ranges of peptides using MALDI-TOF-MS. Correlation matrix analysis between compositional and functional parameters indicated that digestibility was significantly linked with protein and metal concentrations, likely reflecting moisture-dependent solubility and inter-mixing of sarcoplasmic metallo-proteins and insoluble myofibrillar proteins.

AB Aiming to develop a straightforward magnetic-based sample preparation methodology for the selective extraction of dimethoate from olive oil, the synthesis of dimethoate-imprinted polymer on the surface of modified magnetic nanoparticles has been attempted. Molecular recognition assays have proven their suitability for the selective pre-concentration of dimethoate. Mechanistic basis for template selective recognition has been explored using a quantum chemical approach, providing new insights about the mechanisms underlying template recognition. Thus, a magnetic molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction method was developed allowing the extraction of dimethoate from spiked olive oil samples, at levels similar to the maximum residue limits imposed by legislation, followed by the quantification of their levels by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection. Recoveries of 94.55% were obtained, with relative standard deviations lower than 0.53% (n = 3). The developed sample preparation technique enables a selective pre-concentration/enrichment of dimethoate from olive oil matrix with minimum handling and less solvent consumption.

AB Recent years have had an increased demand for goat milk and its products. The quality of goat milk is determined, in part, by the fatty acid (FA) profile, but there is little information about breed influence on the FA profile of goat milk. The aim of this study was to describe and compare FA profiles of goat milk produced by Saanen and Swedish Landrace breeds. FA profiles were analysed by gas chromatography with a flame ionisation detector using 100 m capillary column coated with ionic liquids of extreme polarity (SLB-IL111). The amounts of 19 FAs were measured. Analyses indicated that FA profile in the milk of Saanen goats differs from that of Swedish Landrace goats with the first having higher proportions of most SFA-s and the second having lower proportions of C16:0, C16:1 and C18:1. This knowledge enables the improvement of the quality of goat milk and goat milk-derived products.

AB Yak milk casein was selected as a potential precursor of bioactive peptides based on in silico analysis. Most notable among these are the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides. First, yak milk casein has high homology with cow milk casein by homologous analysis. The potential of yak milk casein for the releasing bioactive peptides was evaluated by determining the frequency of occurrence of fragments with a given activity. Through the BIOPEP database analysis, there are many bioactive peptides in yak milk casein sequences. Then, an in silico proteolysis using single or combined enzymes to obtained ACE inhibitory peptides was investigated. Cytotoxicity analysis using the online toxic prediction tool ToxinPred revealed that all in silico proteolysis derived ACE inhibitory peptides are non-cytotoxic. Overall, the present study highlights a in silico proteolysis approach to assist the yak milk casein releasing ACE inhibitory peptides and provides a guidance for the actual hydrolysis of proteins for the production of bioactive peptides.

AB A statistical optimization study was conducted to obtain a tea containing fermented rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), white tea (Camellia sinensis var. sinensis), and roasted mate (Ilex paraguariensis). An optimal combination of these species was proposed. This optimized tea inhibited 64% the lipoperoxidation in vitro and presented a high phenolic content, especially kaempferol, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, rutin, (-)-epigallocatechin, and (-)-epicatechin-2-O-gallate. Indeed, the antioxidant effect was confirmed by decreasing 30% the reactive oxygen species generation in human hepatoma carcinoma cells (HepG2, 100 and 240 mu g/mL). In the cell viability assay, the GI(50) for human colorectal adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (Caco-2) was about 547 mu g/mL and 481 mu g/mL for HepG2. The pasteurization process (65 degrees C/30 min) did not affect the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of the optimized tea formulation. The sensory test indicated an acceptability index of 78%, showing that the analytical approach adopted was feasible to develop a phenolic-rich beverage.

AB Protein concentrates were prepared from defatted barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) flour using alkaline and enzymatic treatments. Milder enzymatic treatments included (i) a bi-enzymatic method involving the use of starch-hydrolyzing enzymes, and (ii) a tri-enzymatic method using the former bi-enzymatic treatment followed by digestion with glucanase. The concentrate obtained through alkaline extraction (AI-BP) was comprised mainly of low molecular weight fractions of proteins. Bi-enzymatic treatment produced a protein concentrate with the highest protein content (49.0%), while those obtained by the tri-enzymatic treatment followed by an isoelectric precipitation step (TEI-BP) gave the highest protein recovery yield (78.3%). In both of the latter concentrates, 35 kDa B-hordeins were the major protein fraction. Divergence in secondary/tertiary structure elements (AI-BP; TEI-BP) was obtained and attributed to the difference in the protein profiles. Further characterization of protein concentrates indicated that they exhibit pseudoplastic behavior. Emulsifying capacity of concentrates was comparable to that of whey protein isolate.

AB In the last decades, glycoconjugates from Lycium barbarum L. fruit (Goji berry) have received a great attention for their potential health-promoting effects. The present review includes a survey of extraction and purification methods of these bioactive molecules (L. barbarum polysaccharides, LBPs), along with a dissertation on the structural characterisation of the carbohydrate component. Furthermore, an overview of in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies concerning the hypoglycaemic and hypolipidaemic effects of isolated LBP fractions, is reported. The evidence suggests that these purified components of the Goji berry may be potentially useful as adjuvants in the treatment of diabetes and its correlated illnesses.

AB Several studies have reported the role of hedgehog interacting protein-like 1 (HHIPL-1) in different pathologies, including cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present study was to analyze the association of HHIPL-1 (rs2895811) polymorphism with myocardial infarction (MI), cardiometabolic parameters, and traditional cardiovascular risk factors in the Mexican population. The polymorphism was genotyped using a TaqMan assay in 1023 patients with MI and 1105 controls. A similar distribution of the polymorphism was observed between studied groups. However, in patients group, the C allele was associated with a decreased risk of developing hypertriglyceridemia (OR = 0.757, P-additive = 0.030, OR = 0.685, P-dominant = 0.020, OR = 0.691, P-codominant1 = 0.030), metabolic syndrome (OR = 0.746, P-additive = 0.030, OR = 0.647, P-dominant = 0.005, OR = 0.670, P-heterozygote = 0.015, OR = 0.637, P-codominant1 = 0.005), and insulin resistance (OR = 0.681, P-dominant = 0.045). The results suggest that HHIPL-1 rs2895811 polymorphism is associated with cardiometabolic parameters in Mexican patients with MI.

AB Though the roles of BMP signaling in development is studied extensively in insects and vertebrates, our knowledge of BMP signaling in molluscan development is limited. In the present study, we performed a genome-based analysis of TGF-beta receptors in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas and revealed that C. gigas possessed all five canonical members of the gene family, including three type I and two type II receptors. Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed that four receptor genes exhibited universal expression at the gastrula stage but cgi-bmprll mRNA was only expressed at the anterior lip of blastopore, indicating the regulation of BMP signaling through restricted expression of TGF-beta receptors. Treatment of oyster embryos using a BMP signaling inhibitor (dorsomorphin) resulted in obvious changes of the expression of developmental regulatory genes. In particular, three dorsally expressed genes were inhibited and two genes expressed at the opposite side showed increased expression, indicating BMP signaling may function in dorsal-ventral (DV) patterning. Some of the influenced genes were potential shell-formation (pSF) genes, including the well-accepted pSF gene engrailed, and thus this indicates the development of shell field was affected by dorsomorphin treatment. Subsequent scanning electronic observation revealed morphological change of the posterior margin of the shell field. Taken together, these results indicate the roles of BMP signaling in both DV patterning and development of shell field in oyster embryo, which expands our knowledge of early molluscan development.

AB To explore the expression profile of the cellular miRNAs in bovine ovarian granulosa cells responding to transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), the effect of TGF-beta 1 on cell proliferation was firstly investigated by CCK-8 method and the results showed that there was a significant inhibitory effect on bovine granulosa cell proliferation treated with 5/10 ng/mL human recombinant TGF-beta 1 for 24 h compared to the control (P < 0.05). Then, we performed high-throughput sequencing of two small RNA libraries prepared from cultured bovine granulosa cells stimulated with or without 10 ng/mL human recombinant TGF-beta 1. A total of 13,257,248 and 138,726,391 clean reads per library were obtained from TGF-beta 1 and control groups, respectively. There were 498 and 499 bovine-specific exist miRNAs (exist miRNAs), 627 and 570 conserved known miRNAs (known miRNAs), and 593 and 585 predicted novel miRNAs in TGF-beta 1 and control groups, respectively. A total of 78 miRNAs with significant differential expression, including 39 up-regulated miRNAs and 39 down-regulated miRNAs were identified in the TGF-beta 1 group compared with the control. Real-time quantitative PCR analyses of bta-miR-106a and bta-miR-1434-5p showed that their up-expressions were interrupted by SB431542, an inhibitor that blocks TGF beta 1/Smad signaling, which supported the sequencing data. GO analysis showed involvement of the predicted genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs in a broad spectrum of cell biological processes, cell components, and molecular functions. KEGG pathway analysis of the predicted miRNA targets further indicated that these differentially expressed miRNAs are involved in various signaling pathways, such as Wnt, MAPK, and TGF-beta signaling, which might be involved in follicular development. These results provide valuable information on the composition, expression, and function of miRNAs in bovine granulosa cells responding to TGF-beta 1, and will aid in understanding the molecular mechanisms of TGF-beta 1 in granulosa cells.

AB Loblolly pine (LP; Pinus taeda L.) is an economically and ecologically important tree in the southeastern U.S. To advance understanding of the loblolly pine (LP; Pinus taeda L.) genome, we sequenced and analyzed 100 BAC clones and performed a Cot analysis. The Cot analysis indicates that the genome is composed of 57, 24, and 10% highly-repetitive, moderately-repetitive, and single/low-copy sequences, respectively (the remaining 9% of the genome is a combination of fold back and damaged DNA). Although single/low-copy DNA only accounts for 10% of the LP genome, the amount of single/low-copy DNA in LP is still 14 times the size of the Arabidopsis genome. Since gene numbers in LP are similar to those in Arabidopsis, much of the single/low-copy DNA of LP would appear to be composed of DNA that is both gene- and repeat-poor. Macroarrays prepared from a LP bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library were hybridized with probes designed from cell wall synthesis/wood development cDNAs, and 50 of the "targeted" clones were selected for further analysis. An additional 25 clones were selected because they contained few repeats, while 25 more clones were selected at random. The 100 BAC clones were Sanger sequenced and assembled. Of the targeted BACs, 80% contained all or part of the cDNA used to target them. One targeted BAC was found to contain fungal DNA and was eliminated from further analysis. Combinations of similarity-based and ab initio gene prediction approaches were utilized to identify and characterize potential coding regions in the 99 BACs containing LP DNA. From this analysis, we identified 154 gene models (GMs) representing both putative protein-coding genes and likely pseudogenes. Ten of the GMs (all of which were specifically targeted) had enough support to be classified as intact genes. Interestingly, the 154 GMs had statistically indistinguishable (alpha = 0.05) distributions in the targeted and random BAC clones (15.18 and 12.61 GM/Mb, respectively), whereas the low-repeat BACs contained significantly fewer GMs (7.08 GM/Mb). However, when GM length was considered, the targeted BACs had a significantly greater percentage of their length in GMs (3.26%) when compared to random (1.63%) and low-repeat (0.62%) BACs. The results of our study provide insight into LP evolution and inform ongoing efforts to produce a reference genome sequence for LP, while characterization of genes involved in cell wall production highlights carbon metabolism pathways that can be leveraged for increasing wood production.

SO GENE

DT Article
DE Bacteria; Essentiality; Conservation; Selective pressure; Codon bias
ID ESSENTIAL GENES; NONESSENTIAL GENES; DATABASE
AB Essential genes constitute the core of genes which cannot be mutated too much nor lost along the evolutionary history of a species. Natural selection is expected to be stricter on essential genes and on conserved (highly shared) genes, than on genes that are either nonessential or peculiar to a single or a few species. In order to further assess this expectation, we study here how essentiality of a gene is connected with its degree of conservation among several unrelated bacterial species, each one characterised by its own codon usage bias. Confirming previous results on E. cob, we show the existence of a universal exponential relation between gene essentiality and conservation in bacteria. Moreover, we show that, within each bacterial genome, there are at least two groups of functionally distinct genes, characterised by different levels of conservation and codon bias: i) a core of essential genes, mainly related to cellular information processing; ii) a set of less conserved nonessential genes with prevalent functions related to metabolism. In particular, the genes in the first group are more retained among species, are subject to a stronger purifying conservative selection and display a more limited repertoire of synonymous codons. The core of essential genes is close to the minimal bacterial genome, which is in the focus of recent studies in synthetic biology, though we confirm that orthologs of genes that are essential in one species are not necessarily essential in other species. We also list a set of highly shared genes which, reasonably, could constitute a reservoir of targets for new anti-microbial drugs.

AB The effect of the scale used to compute the interfacial curvature on the prediction of dynamic gas-liquid interfaces is investigated. A new interface curvature calculation methodology referred to herein as the Adjustable Curvature Evaluation Scale (ACES) is proposed. ACES leverages a weighted least squares regression to fit a polynomial through points computed on the volume-of-fluid representation of the gas-liquid interface. The interface curvature is evaluated from this polynomial. Varying the least squares weight with distance from the location where the curvature is being computed, adjusts the scale the curvature is evaluated on. ACES is verified using canonical static test cases and compared against second- and fourth-order height function methods.
   Simulations of dynamic interfaces, including a standing wave and oscillating droplet, are performed to assess the impact of the curvature evaluation scale for predicting interface motions. ACES and the height function methods are combined with two different unsplit geometric volume-of-fluid (VoF) schemes that define the interface on meshes with different levels of refinement. We find that the results depend significantly on curvature evaluation scale. Particularly, the ACES scheme with a properly chosen weight function is accurate, but fails when the scale is too small or large. Surprisingly, the second-order height function method is more accurate than the fourth-order variant for the dynamic tests even though the fourth-order method performs better for static interfaces. Comparing the curvature evaluation scale of the second- and fourth-order height function methods, we find the second-order method is closer to the optimum scale identified with ACES. This result suggests that the curvature scale is driving the accuracy of the dynamics. This work highlights the importance of studying numerical methods with realistic (dynamic) test cases and that the interactions of the various discretizations is as important as the accuracy of one part of the discretization.

AB We develop efficient energy stable numerical methods for solving isotropic and strongly anisotropic Cahn-Hilliard systems with the Willmore regularization. The scheme, which involves adaptive mesh refinement and a nonlinear multigrid finite difference method, is constructed based on a convex splitting approach. We prove that, for the isotropic Cahn-Hilliard system with the Willmore regularization, the total free energy of the system is non-increasing for any time step and mesh sizes. A straightforward modification of the scheme is then used to solve the regularized strongly anisotropic Cahn-Hilliard system, and it is numerically verified that the discrete energy of the anisotropic system is also non-increasing, and can be efficiently solved by using the modified stable method. We present numerical results in both two and three dimensions that are in good agreement with those in earlier work on the topics. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB An exponential time-integrator scheme of second-order accuracy based on the predictor-corrector methodology, denoted PCEXP, is developed to solve multi-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations pertaining to fluid dynamics. The effective and efficient implementation of PCEXP is realized by means of the Krylov method. The linear stability and truncation error are analyzed through a one-dimensional model equation. The proposed PCEXP scheme is applied to the Euler equations discretized with a discontinuous Galerkin method in both two and three dimensions. The effectiveness and efficiency of the PCEXP scheme are demonstrated for both steady and unsteady inviscid flows. The accuracy and efficiency of the PCEXP scheme are verified and validated through comparisons with the explicit third-order total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta scheme (TVDRK3), the implicit backward Euler (BE) and the implicit second-order backward difference formula (BDF2). For unsteady flows, the PCEXP scheme generates a temporal error much smaller than the BDF2 scheme does, while maintaining the expected acceleration at the same time. Moreover, the PCEXP scheme is also shown to achieve the computational efficiency comparable to the implicit schemes for steady flows. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Population Balance Models have a wide range of applications in many industrial fields as they allow accounting for heterogeneity among properties which are crucial for some system modelling. They actually describe the evolution of a Number Density Function (NDF) using a Population Balance Equation (PBE). For instance, they are applied to gas-liquid columns or stirred reactors, aerosol technology, crystallisation processes, fine particles or biological systems. There is a significant interest for fast, stable and accurate numerical methods in order to solve for PBEs, a class of such methods actually does not solve directly the NDF but resolves their moments. These methods of moments, and in particular quadrature-based methods of moments, have been successfully applied to a variety of systems. Point-wise values of the NDF are sometimes required but are not directly accessible from the moments. To address these issues, the Extended Quadrature Method of Moments (EQMOM) has been developed in the past few years and approximates the NDF, from its moments, as a convex mixture of Kernel Density Functions (KDFs) of the same parametric family. In the present work EQMOM is further developed on two aspects. The main one is a significant improvement of the core iterative procedure of that method, the corresponding reduction of its computational cost is estimated to range from 60% up to 95%. The second aspect is an extension of EQMOM to two new KDFs used for the approximation, the Weibull and the Laplace kernels.

AB The expanding raw materials base is one of the drivers for the further development of inorganic binders, including alkali-activated cements. This research focuses on studying marl with a high calcite/aluminosilicates ratio as a geopolymer precursor, and limestone as a mineral addition to this geopolymer. The calcination of marl at 800 degrees C resulting in the formation of reactive Si, Al, and Ca due to the dehydroxylation of clay minerals and decarbonation of calcite makes marl suitable for use as a geopolymer precursor. Calcined marl activated with sodium silicate and cured at ambient temperature had a 28-day compressive strength of 34 MPa. When incorporated with 50% limestone, the compressive strength became 39.2 MPa. XRD, TG/DSC, FTIR, optical and SEM have been used to investigate the reaction products, as well as the microstructure of the geopolymer hardened pastes.

AB Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been performed to explore the correlation between dynamic characteristics and structural heterogeneity in undercooled Cu50Zr50 melt based on the embedded atom method. It is found that atoms in the undercooled liquid can be classified into three groups in terms of the probability distribution of atoms' displacement, named 'fast atoms' (FAs), 'intermediate atoms' (IAs), 'slow atoms' (SAs). Meanwhile, the undercooled liquid can be divided into three temperature regime: as the temperature is higher than 1120 K, the distribution of FAs become network connectivity, in which the SAs region are surrounded; as the temperature is in the range from 1120 K to 900 K, the network of FAs region decompose into several isolated region gradually; after that the single relaxation separates into alpha- and beta-relaxation at temperature lower than 900 K, the FM region become isolated islands, while the SAs have connected into networks where the FAs regions are surrounded, which cause the significant decreasing of atomic mobility and sharp increasing of the relaxation time. The FM, located in loose packaging and isolated region, which corresponds to beta-relaxation reflected by the time-scale of intermediate plateau in mean-squared displacement (MSD) and intermediate scattering function (ISF). The SAs which develop into the backbone of the system and surround clusters formed by FAs, are responsible for the glass formation and have a connection with alpha-relaxation. The compressive deformation in the Cu50Zr50 metallic glass shows that the 'fast atoms', anticipating in beta-relaxation of undercooled liquid, mostly are located in large shear strain zones and the structural heterogeneity of undercooled liquid inherits into the glass. Since metallic glass (MG) can be regarded as frozen undercooled liquid, our study is helpful for understanding the structural origins of dynamical relaxation in MGs.

AB The influence of scan speed and fluence on the formation of micro/nano-structures were explored under 800 nm, 35 femtosecond (fs) laser irradiation. Surface morphology, roughness, and laser-induced defects of prepared samples were characterized. The antireflection property and wettability of laser treated samples were also tested and compared with that of original fused silica. Results showed that the laser irradiated structures included melt zone, nanofibers, laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS), and fluffy structures. At a fix scan speed, high-spatial-frequency LIPSS (HFSL) were observed in the low fluence region. A transition from HSFL to LSFL (low-spatial-frequency LIPSS) occurs when a critical fluence threshold is exceeded. Otherwise, the scan speed significantly influences the surface roughness and should be controlled carefully during the preparation process. The material structural modification in laser-irradiated fused silica surface was verified by the Raman spectra. The concentration of oxygen deficient centers (ODCs), and non-bridging oxygen hole centers (NBOHCs) increased after femtosecond laser irradiation by analyzing the photoluminescence. The laser irradiated surface has a better antireflection property in comparison with that of original fused silica, which may be due to the scattering and absorption of micro/nano structures. After laser treatment, the micro/nano structured fused silica presented super-hydrophilic property. The contact angle of water droplet decreases can be explained by Wenzel's model.

AB We analyze dielectric-loss spectra of glass forming salol extending up to 400 GHz allowing for the detection of the high-frequency minimum, where the fast critical dynamics predicted by the mode-coupling theory of the glass transition should prevail. Indeed, we find such a minimum which, moreover, well fulfills the critical scaling predicted by the theory. This includes the spectral shape of the minimum, the critical temperature dependence of the minimum frequency and amplitude, and the critical temperature dependence of the a-relaxation rate at high temperatures. The minimum exponents a and b leading to a system parameter lambda approximate to 0.63 and the critical temperature T-c = 256 K are all in reasonable agreement with previous investigations of salol using different methods. Salol was one of the first materials where mode-coupling theory was tested and initial dielectric measurements were taken as an argument against the universal applicability of this theory.

AB Glasses and/or glass fibers of a new glass system, RE2O3 (RE = Sc,Y, La)-MgO-CaO-Al2O3-SiO2, were studied in detail, covering rare earth (RE) effects on high temperature viscosity, liquidus temperature and crystalline phases, softening and glass transition temperature, and speciation reactions of aluminum (AlOx, x = 4, 5) and silicate network (Q(n), n = 4, 3, 2) using Al-27 and Si-29 MAS NMR and Raman spectroscopic methods. Rare earth oxides (RE2O3) were shown to have a dual functionality, i.e., decreasing melt viscosity like a network modifier depolymerizing glass network, but increasing viscosity at low temperature, i.e., glass softening temperature (T-soft) and transition temperature (T-g), strengthening the glass network functioning like Al2O3. Liquidus temperature (T-Liq) was found to be sensitive to the type of RE2O3 modifications in terms of their ionic field strength (IFS); Sc3+ of the highest IFS increased, but La3+ of the lowest IFS decreased T-Liq. Effect of Y3+ (intermediate IFS) on T-Liq resembles Sc3+ only at higher concentration. The overall results suggest that RE ions of different IFS have different "true" solubility limits in the host glass matrix, above which RE2Si2O7 crystallizes. All of the glasses with and without RE2O3 contained predominately four-fold coordinated aluminum, AlO4; yet replace. ment of CaO by RE2O3 increased AlO5 according to Al-27 MQMAS NMR spectroscopic measurements. Raman spectroscopic results suggested that depolymerization of the silicate network.

ID RICE HUSK ASH
AB The use of binders as an alternative to Portland cement has gained importance in recent years. Among them, geopolymeric binders, developed by the reaction between an aluminosilicate precursor and a high alkalinity solution, have become one of the most promising alternatives. The activating solution generally comprises waterglass and sodium hydroxide. Since waterglass is the most expensive material and has a high environmental impact, using alternative silica sources will lead to more sustainable binders. Previous studies have successfully used rice husk ash (RHA) as a silica source. This research aims to assess the possibility of using diatomaceous earth (or diatomite) as an alternative silica source, like the previous studies with RHA. Diatomite is a sedimentary rock with a high amorphous silica content formed by fossilized diatom remains. In this work, the geopolymer was obtained using a fluid cracking catalyst residue as the precursor and six different activating solution types prepared with commercial products, residual diatomite (from beer and wine industries) and RHA. The results open a new possible route for the reuse and recovery of diatomaceous earth residue, although the compressive strength results of the mortars were slightly lower than those for mortars prepared with RHA or commercial reagents.

AB Low mechanical strength is a major challenge for porous scaffolds in bone tissue engineering. Porous scaffold with honeycomb structure, which exhibits excellent mechanical properties, has great application potential in tissue engineering. This study was aimed to explore the influence of structure characteristics on the mechanical properties of the comby scaffolds. The scaffolds were printed by three-dimensional printer, using polylactic acid (PLA) and photosensitive resin (PR) as model material. The effect of structural details (e.g. porosity, pore size and pore interconnectivity) on mechanical properties was discussed in this paper. The results showed that structural design played a critical role in improving the mechanical properties of porous scaffolds. Compared with random structure, the ordered structure constructed by three-dimensional printing (3DP) conferred much higher mechanical strength to the porous materials. And the ordered structure could overcome the negative effects of high porosity on mechanical strength in some degree. Moreover, in the suitable pore size range (50-1000 mm) for cell growth, there was an obvious negative correlation between aperture size and compressive strength. In the condition of fulfilling the requirements of bone repair, smaller pore size might be beneficial for the mechanical strength of porous scaffolds. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry studies confirmed the formation of composite between the host material and the dispersoid. The experimental data indicate that addition of NaNO3 significantly improves electrical conductivity of pure LiNaSO4 in the low temperature phase. A possible mechanism of conductivity enhancement in dispersed system is interpreted in terms of the formation of space charge layer between the host material and the dispersoid in which defect concentration increases.

The X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques confirmed the formation of crystalline Sm2Se3. The formation of Sm2Se3 across-linked nanorods was confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy technique. The cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to study the supercapacitive properties of the electrode. The highly porous network of the electrode resulted from this assembly exhibited excellent capacitive behavior with a maximum specific capacitance (316 F g(-1)) and cycling stability (87%) for 1000 charge-discharge cycles.

AB Hollow nanoparticles with tailored shell structures have been attractive for electrochemical energy storage applications. CoSe2 nanoboxes (NBs) were synthesized successfully using Co-Prussian blue analogue (PBA) metal organic framework (MOF) as a template. Co-PBA NBs were obtained by etching the cube-shaped crystals of Co-PBA with ammonia. Subsequent selenization of Co-PBA NBs afforded CoSe2 NBs. Due to the hollow and conductive nature, the CoSe2 NBs provided excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In 1 M KOH aqueous solution, CoSe2 NBs delivered overpotential of 335 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slop of 54.2 mV dec(-1), and good cycling stability, suggesting possibility of being used as a electrochemical catalyst for alkaline fuel cells.

AB The roots of plants have rarely been used as templates. In this work, four novel hierarchical metal oxides were firstly synthesized by a simple immersion and calcination method using scallion root as natural biotemplate. The as-synthesized metal oxides have principally inherited the tubular frame structure of scallion root with rib-shaped inside walls. The hierarchical tubular structure of Co3O4, Fe2O3 and NiO are assembled by small particles with diameter of 7-20 nm, while the morphology of the building blocks for ZnO micro-tubes changes from hexagonal nanoplates to hexagonal nanorods with the increasing concentration of the Zn2+ immersing solution. These results reveal that scallion root is a good biotemplate for the synthesis of novel hierarchical metal oxides. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we systematically investigated the effects of CoFe2O4 (CFO) nanofillers on the beta-phase formation of piezoelectric PVDF after solvent casting, thermal annealing, electrical poling, and uniaxial stretching, which are all essential steps in the fabrication of magnetoelectric composites. Therefore, zero-dimensional CFO nanoparticles and one-dimensional CFO nanorods were prepared as magnetostrictive nanofillers via hydrothermal synthesis. Among three-type films consisting of PVDF, PVDF/CFO nanoparticles, and PVDF/CFO nanorods, the beta-phase fractions of PVDF were found to exhibit the maximum values of 47.1 after poling and 78.5% after stretching, in the films of PVDF/CFO nanoparticles. These results illustrated that the shape and size of CFO nanofillers are very important for the design of polymer-based magnetoelectric composites, because the nanofillers are beneficial to provide a physical barrier that helps maintain parallel dipoles of the beta-phase, while simultaneously playing the negative role of conductors to induce electrical percolation.

Ferromagnetic behaviors were analyzed by means of magnetization measurements as a function of the applied magnetic field for different orientations. The coercive field values and remanence showed no the predominance of a specific reversal mode for magnetic moments, probably due to the imperfections in the real nanotubes if compared with the ideal conditions for theoretical predictions. For obtaining, the chemical electrodepositing using porous polycarbonate membranes as templates, with "average" pore diameter of 250 nm.

DE Iron-reach glass-ceramic; Vitrification; Structure
AB Hazardous residues from ferronickel production and glass cullet were mixed and vitrified. After low-cost heat-treatment the obtained glass was transformed in a fine-crystalline glass-ceramic. The evolution of structure during the crystallization cycle is studied by XRD and SEM-EDS. Finally, the morphology of final glass-ceramic was elucidated by TEM and FESEM.
   Due to the elevate amounts of iron and magnesium oxides and the presence of similar to 2 wt % chromium oxides in the composition, the crystallization process is peculiar and the final structure of glass-ceramic is complex. Some preliminary Fe-Mg-Cr spinel crystals with size of few microns precipitate during the melt cooling. Then, these crystals act as centres for the growth of a pyroxene phase; thus, 15-20 vol% of the glass-ceramic structure is formed. The major amorphous phase, where Cr2O3 concentration becomes negligible, is characterized with a high immiscibility trend, leading to the formation of Fe-rich droplets with size of 50-70 nm. Subsequently, these droplets are transformed into nano magnetite crystals, which provoke crystallisation of the main pyroxene phase. This "second" new pyroxene phase differs by the one, already formed on the preliminary Fe-Mg-Cr spinel, and is composed by mono-crystals with size of 150-200 nm. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A series of flower-like Bi2WO6 with oxygen vacancies were produced through an etching process at room temperature using NaBH4 as reducing agent. The structure and morphology were further confirmed by XRD, SEM, HRTEM and XPS. The performance of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting for all samples was investigated by evaluating the charge-transfer resistance, electrons lifetime and photoinduced carrier density. The results demonstrated that the Bi2WO6 with appropriate concentration of oxygen vacancies exhibited higher PEC properties than pure Bi2WO6 and the enhanced PEC performance of the Bi2WO6-x was ascribed to the presence of oxygen vacancies. The oxygen vacancies can introduce impurity levels under the conduction band which can act as electron trapping centers in Bi2WO6-x resulted in the band gap narrowing, which accelerates the separation and transfer of charges and reduced the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole.

AB In this work, two kinds of core-shell diblock polymer brushes, i.e., poly(acrylic acid)-b-poly(N-isopropyla crylamide) and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-b-poly(acrylic acid) diblock polymer brushes with polystyrene cores (PSV@PAA-b-PNIPA and PSV@PNIPA-b-PAA), were prepared by surface-initiated photoinifer-termediated polymerization (SI-PIMP). Both of them are demonstrated to be dually responsive to pH and temperature. Compared to brushes with random polymer chains of PAA and PNIPA, the control of PAA and PNIPA block sequence not only affects the responsive behavior, but also changes the competition between intermolecular and intramolecular forces which results in remarkable conformation variation. The "inverse" temperature response of PSV@PAA-b-PNIPA could shine light on structure design of polymer brushes for applications such as protein separation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A highly porous scaffold with tunable pore sizes is desirable and beneficial to facilitate the migration, spreading, and proliferation of cells in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. In this study, porous collagen scaffolds with various pore sizes were prepared using alginate microspheres as porogen materials. The collagen scaffolds had high water content (up to 98%), various porosities and degradation behaviors, and well connected pore structures. A maximum pore size of 700 mu m was obtained; in contrary, the intact porous structures of the scaffolds could not be maintained using Al2O3 beads or polystyrene bead porogens. The stress of the collagen scaffolds ranged from 0.29 to 0.43 kPa. In vitro studies indicated that seeded rat mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs) were able to attach, spread, and proliferate on the scaffold surfaces. Furthermore, the human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) proliferated preferentially across the largest pore areas after 14 days of culturing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Nanoporous carbons (NPC-2) were prepared from benzoxazine resin with ZIF-8 as a template and activation agent simultaneously by high temperature carbonization. The structures, morphologies and electrochemical performance are characterized by XRD, Raman, SEM, TEM and electrochemical measurements. In comparison with the carbonization product of pure ZIF-8 (NCP-1), the NCP-2 exhibits a large specific capacitance (168.9 F g(-1) at 0.05 A g-1) and superior cycle stability (96.1% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g(-1)). This indicates that the NPC-2 is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a narrow-band red-emitting BaSiF6: Mn4+ (BSFM) phosphor with regular hexagonal nanorod morphology were successfully prepared through using SiO2 spheres as raw materials in a hydrothermal process (S-BSFM). Interestingly, the as-prepared BSFM nanorods presented better luminescence intensity (about 1.4 times) than that of BSFM sample prepared by using bulk SiO2 as raw material (B-BSFM). Moreover, compared to the B-BSFM samples, the S-BSFM phosphor not only maintained the high thermal stability and chromaticity stability but also improved the color purity. The corresponding luminescence improvement mechanism was proposed that the surface functionalization of SiO2 spheres induced the formation of regular hexagonal nanorods with smooth surface, and thus reduced the non-radiative transitions.

SO MATERIALS LETTERS

ID PIGMENTS
AB The use of red mud (RM) and Cr/Ni electroplating sludge (ES), two hazardous industrial wastes, was studied as possible coloring agents for commercial glazes: transparent (TR), bright white (BR) and matte (MT). The influence that a heat treatment produced on the color development/stability was analyzed by comparing, separately, RM and ES non-calcined and calcined at 1200 degrees C. RM and ES yielded glazes with red/brown and grey/green hues, respectively. The calcination enhanced the powders coloring strength. ES (non-calcined and calcined) provides a fairly stable coloration when added to BR and MT, and RM (non-calcined and calcined) when added to TP and BR, upon firing at 1100 +/- 15 degrees C. So, depending on the type of glaze, when using RM and ES as coloring agents their previous heat treatment can be avoid leading to meaningful environmental and economic benefits.

AB Nanostructured metal oxide semiconductors (MOSs) are widely used in the field of sensors. Different from the traditional single MOS based sensors, heterojunction-based sensors using two different MOS materials can take advantage of the charge separation effect at the heterojunction interface for an enhanced sensing mechanism. In this work, an in-situ synthesis method of p-CuO nanowire/n-ZnO nanosheet heterojunctions and its application for near-ultraviolet light detection was demonstrated. A rectifying behavior arising from the heterojunctions was observed in the I-V characterization. Under different illumination conditions, the photocurrent obeys a power law with a detection limit around 16.8 mW/mm(2), validating the potential for near-UV sensing applications.

AB Micro/nanoscale Mg-MOF-74 materials with different morphologies and sizes have been fabricated in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) by adjusting the amount of aqueous ammonia and reaction temperature. The obtained samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and it was found that the Mg-MOF-74 particles show morphology and size dependent adsorption properties. The selectivity factors of the Mg-MOF-74 particles at 273 K were calculated based on the experimental single-component isotherms by ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST). The results indicate that the Mg-MOF-74 particles have intrinsic high selectivity for adsorption of CO2 over CH4 and N-2. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Porous gallium nitride (GaN) luminescent materials were fabricated by photoelectrochemical etching using three different 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ([EMIM])-based ionic liquids as the etchants. The as-etched porous GaN presents honeycomb shape, deep gully with some holes in the surroundings, and overlapping hole structure, which are significantly different from the planar GaN. Moreover, photoluminescence (PL) spectra indicates that the porous GaN has more excellent PL performance than the planar GaN. In general, reducing the etching time to 1 min, the PL intensity of porous GaN etched by [EMIM] [OTF] is 9.27 times than that of the planar one. These results suggest that porous GaN etched by ionic liquid can be an outstanding substrate in the field of the luminescent material. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This research addresses the use of an emerging plasma spray technique known as Solution Precursor Plasma Spraying (SPPS) to obtain bioactive glass coatings. In SPPS, the feedstock is a sol precursor of the bioactive glass instead of glass particles. Precursor feedstock composition (presence or not of acid catalyst), plasma torch enthalpy and stand-off distance of the spraying process have been varied to produce bioactive glass coatings of nominally 45S5 composition. A good quality coating was obtained when catalyst (0.2 M acid nitric) was used in the precursor and the plasma spraying took place with shorter stand-off distance and higher plasma enthalpy. Bioactivity in Simulated Body Fluid test was confirmed and an effect of the coating interconnected porosity to enhance bioactivity was observed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   analysis; Electrical properties
ID DISCHARGE; NANOCOMPOSITES; DECOMPOSITION; PRESSURE
AB The influences of direct fluorination on the structural, morphological, surface free energy, thermal and electric properties of polyimide films were systematically investigated by ATR-IR, SEM, contact angles, thermo-gravimetric analysis, surface conductivity and potential decay, respectively. The results indicate that the fluorination leads to substantial changes in surface composition and structure, and a modification of the surface morphology. It is also observed that the fluorination also gave rise to an increase in surface hydrophilicity and a decrease in surface free energy. The thermal stability of fluorinated polyimide film seems to slightly decrease. The intrinsic increase in surface electrical conduction is considered to be a result of decrease in depth of charge traps. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Conductive thin films of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are very promising materials as transparent electrodes because of their high conductivity, transparency, flexibility and low cost of fabrication compared to traditional materials like indium tin oxide (ITO). The quality of the film depends on the type of CNTs, dispersion conditions, fabrication and post-treatment processes. Single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were firstly produced by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method and then thin films were fabricated by vacuum filtration method. The post-treatments, acid treatment and annealing, were applied to improve the film quality and optoelectronic properties. Homogeneity, density, morphology, the resistivity of the fabricated SWCNT thin films were analyzed by various characterization methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mimicking the three-dimensional (3D) biological structure of native tissues and organs has remained a challenge for tissue engineering. The current use of hydrogels for intervertebral disc (IVD) repair is not ideal for insufficient mechanical properties. To overcome this limitation, we combine the excellent mechanical performance of poly (lactic acid) (PLA) with the biocompatibility and bioprintability of gellan gum-poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (GG-PEGDA) double network hydrogel to meet the necessary requirement of IVD regeneration. The cell-laden constructs were fabricated using 3D bioprinting technology. Mechanical and degradation properties of the dual printed scaffolds can be regulated by controlling the infill patterns and density of the PLA frameworks. Bone marrow stromal cells co-printed into the PLA/GG-PEGDA scaffolds remained high viability and showed excellent spreading within the hydrogels. Considering positive biocompatibility accompanied with suitable mechanical properties, this hybrid scaffolds have the potential to assist IVD regeneration. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Electrochemically splitting water requires low cost, high performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. Here we synthesized amorphous CoFeW ternary metal oxides nanoparticles supported on carbon through annealing uniform CoFeW nanoparticles synthesized by solution based pyrolysis method, and this catalyst exhibited high activity towards OER. A low overpotential of 306 mV is required to achieve the OER current density of 10 mA cm (2) by the CoFeWOx/C with optimized composition. The high activity is attributed to the fine-tuned electronic structure by the mixed oxides. This catalyst is also stable indicating by almost no decay after 40 h chronopotentiometry test or 1000 cyclic voltammetry. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Coccidiosis is a serious threat to the poultry industry, resulting in substantial economic losses worldwide. The effective development of alternative treatments for coccidiosis that does not involve chemotherapy drugs and does not result in antibiotic resistance relies on gaining a clearer understanding of the interaction between host intestinal microbiota and enteric coccidia. Here, we established an Eimeria tenella infection model in chickens and subsequently monitored the changes in the overall intestinal microbiome using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found that the gut (i.e. fecal) microbiota of infected chicken differed from that of uninfected naive animals. Levels of non-pathogenic bacteria, including Lactobacillus and Faecalibacterium declined, whereas those of pathogenic bacteria, including Clostridium, Lysinibacillus, and Escherichia, increased over time in response to E. tenella infection. Similar dynamic changes of the fecal microbiota were observed in both Arbor Acres broilers and White Leghorn chickens, indicating that the perturbation of the microbiota was directly induced by E. tenella infection. Our findings could be used to further elucidate the serious damage to host health caused by coccidia infection, leading to the development of new effective treatment options for coccidiosis.

AB Blastocystis is one of the most commonly detected intestinal protozoan parasites worldwide and has been found in humans and other animals. Therefore, many countries have actively researched this parasite. However, to our knowledge, no study of Blastocystis has been conducted in Korea. Therefore, we conducted a study of the current status of Blastocystis infection in domestic cattle, the various genotypes involved, and its zoonotic potential through a phylogenetic comparison with subtypes found in other studies. The feces of cattle were randomly collected throughout Korea; basic information, including collection date, sex, and cattle type was recorded, and DNA extraction, PCR, and phylogenetic analyses were performed. A total of 1,512 fecal samples were tested. The 101 Blastocystis-positive samples were obtained, yielding an approximate infection rate of 6.7%. Differences in age, cattle type, fecal type, and season were statistically significant between Blastocystis-positive and -negative cattle. In this study, four subtypes of Blastocystis (ST1, ST5, ST10, and ST14) were confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. ST1 and ST5 are potential zoonotic subtypes, therefore the possibility of zoonotic transmission cannot be ignored. Further research and clarification of the infection and transmission patterns of Blastocystis are warranted.

AB Macrophages are multipurpose phagocytes and are considered to be irreplaceable during the early host innate immune response against microbial and parasitic pathogens. However, no report has investigated the novel anti parasitic mechanism of macrophage-derived extracellular traps (ETs) against the abortive apicomplexan parasite Neospora caninum (N. caninum) in cattle. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to visualize and characterize N. caninum tachyzoite-induced macrophage-triggered ETs in exposed bovine macrophages. Fluorescence confocal microscopy was used to confirm the classical backbone structure of DNA embedded with histone 3 (H3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in N. caninum tachyzoite-induced macrophage-derived ETs. Furthermore, the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the supernatants of parasite-exposed macrophages were detected by a LDH Cytotoxicity Assay (R) kit. The results clearly demonstrated that N. caninwn tachyzoites triggered bovine macrophage-derived ET-like structures. Inhibiting assays revealed that N. caninum tachyzoite-induced macrophage mediated ET formation may be an ERK 1/2- and p38 MAPK-dependent cell death process. In conclusion, the present study is the first report on the formation of ETs in bovine macrophages against N, caninwn tachyzoites and adds new data on the possible role of macrophages in vivo infection by capturing invasive stages and exposing them to other leukocytes.

AB Targeted selective treatment (TST) has been proposed as a sustainable method of gastrointestinal nematode control that reduces the number of anthelmintic treatments administered, thereby preserving a susceptible nematode population in refugia. In order to minimise the impact of withholding treatment on animal performance, animals that would benefit most should be selected for treatment. However, the most suitable criteria for selecting which animals to treat remain a subject of research. The impact of implementing a TST strategy based on lamb live weight was investigated, and whether heavy lambs were more resilient than light lambs if left untreated. The study was conducted using weaned lambs on 3 sheep farms, and over 2 years. On each farm lambs were weighed and divided into heavy, medium and light weight classes. Within the heavy (n = 225) and light (n = 218) weight classes lambs were randomly allocated to two treatments; anthelmintic treatment or no anthelmintic treatment. All lambs in the medium weight class were treated. Animal performance and parasitological parameters were assessed over a 28-day period. Anthelmintic treatment had a significant effect (P < 0.01) on faecal egg count, average daily weight gain, body condition score and dag score; there was no treatment by weight class interaction. Anthelmintic treatment had no effect on plasma pepsinogen concentration or on blood leukocyte numbers. Withholding anthelmintic treatment from lambs therefore had a negative effect on worm egg count and animal performance with no evidence that heavy lambs were more resilient than light lambs when left untreated.

AB Fasciola hepatica infection continues to be a major problem in the agriculture sector, particularly in sheep and cattle. Cathepsin L and B proteases are major components of the excretory/secretory material of the parasite, and their roles in several important aspects of parasite invasion and survival has led to their use as targets in rational vaccine design. Previous studies in rats demonstrated that the use of stage-specific antigens, cathepsin B2 and cathepsin L5, as part of a multivalent vaccine, was able to confer significant protection against challenge. In the present study, recombinant versions of cathepsin L5 and cathepsin B2 produced in yeast were used in combination to vaccinate sheep. Intramuscular and intranasal forms of administration were applied, and sheep were subsequently challenged with 150 F. hepatica metacercariae. Intramuscular vaccination was able to induce a strong systemic antibody response against both antigens, but failed to confer significant protection. Conversely, no elevated antibody response was detected against the vaccine antigens following nasal vaccination; however, a reduction in parasite egg viability (> 92%) and a statistically significant (p = 0.006), predominantly adjuvant mediated reduction in worm burdens was observed.

AB The development of a method to rapidly diagnose Neospora caninum infection is highly desirable. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), combined with lateral flow (LF) strips, is a novel approach to rapidly amplify and visualize DNA. We have developed a prototype LF-RPA assay, using primers and a probe that targeted a specific sequence in the N. caninum NC-5 gene. The N. caninum-specific LF-RPA assay was first tested on purified DNA from oocysts and amplified N. caninum DNA to detectable levels in 10 min, at a constant temperature and without the need for an expensive thermocycler. The designed RPA primers and probe displayed 100% specificity for detecting N. caninum without any cross-reaction with DNA from nine related protozoan spp. (eg Toxoplasma gondii, Sarcocystis gigantean, Sarcocystis zuoi, Hanunondia hammondi, Hammondia heydorni, Eimeria cylindrica, Plasmodium falciparum, Theileria annulata and Babesia bigemina). Although, LF-RPA assay detected amounts as low as 50 fg of N. caninum DNA, it was nearly 5-fold less sensitive than previously published qPCR and nested PCR assays. We tested the diagnostic performance of the LF-RPA assay for the detection of N. caninum DNA in aborted bovine fetal tissue samples, and compared the results with those obtained from nested PCR. Out of the 75 samples examined, 18 (24%) and 17 (22.6%) tested positive using LF-RPA and nested PCR, respectively. Our results indicate that LF-RPA is a suitable assay for the rapid and reliable detection of N. caninum.

AB The poultry red mite, Dermanyssus gallinae, is one of the most economically deleterious ectoparasites affecting egg-laying hens in many parts of the world. New approaches to control D. gallinae often require the maintenance of colonies of D. gallinae under laboratory conditions. In the present study, we present an efficient rearing system for D. gallinae, consisting of a metal cage, a plastic storage box and a tray filled with water. Chicks were raised in the cage as host animals. A novel trap was developed to monitor the dynamic changes of mite populations, made with a plastic centrifuge tube and a disposable breathing mask with folds. Mite parameters were analyzed, including number of mites and eggs, survival and feeding rates, oviposition, hatchability and the proportion of D. gallinae at different life stages. The results show that the rearing system had a 53.5-fold increase in the number of mites over a period of six weeks after the introduction of mites. The survival rates of mites were above 94%, and the mean feeding rates ranged from 22.57% to 37.30%. The mean number of eggs per female ranged from 3.42 to 3.50, with the hatchability of eggs above 97%. Nymphs made up most of the population, ranging from 71.46% to 81.37%, while the population of larvae was minor and ranging from 7.54% to 13.04%. The mask trap used in this study was an effective and convenient device to shelter D. gallinae and monitor the dynamic changes of the mite population. The rearing system proved very effective in maintaining and reproducing colonies of D. gallinae, with great potential for the evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines or compounds against D. gallinae under laboratory conditions. It would be a useful tool for close observations in studies on the biology, acology and physiology of poultry red mites.

AB Fasciola hepatica is a trematode parasite that causes fasciolosis in animals and humans. Fasciolosis is usually treated with triclabendazole, although drug-resistant parasites have been described in several geographical locations. An alternative to drug treatment would be the use of a vaccine, although vaccination studies that have been performed mainly in ruminants over the last 30 years, show high variability in the achieved protection and are not yet ready for commercialisation. Since F. hepatica exhibits a high degree of genomic polymorphism, variation in vaccine efficacy could be attributed, at least partially, to phenotypic differences in vaccine candidate sequences amongst parasites used in the challenge infections. To begin to address this issue, a collection of F. hepatica isolates from geographically dispersed regions, as well as parasites obtained from vaccination trials performed against a field isolate from Uruguay and the experimentally maintained South Gloucester isolate (Ridgeway Research, UK), were compiled to establish a F. hepatica Biobank. These collected isolates were used for the genetic analysis of several vaccine candidates that are important in host-parasite interactions and are the focus of the H2020 PARAGONE vaccine project (https://www.paragoneh2020.eu/), namely FhCL1, FhCL2, FhPrx, FhLAP and FhHDM. Our results show that F. hepatica exhibits a high level of conservation in the sequences encoding each of these proteins. The consequential low variability in these vaccine candidates amongst parasites from different geographical regions reinforces the idea that they would be suitable immunogens against liver fluke isolates worldwide.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the overall efficacy, larval expulsion and larvicidal effect of spinosad on the treatment of myiasis caused by New World screwworm Cochliomyia hominivorax in naturally infested dogs. Six Beagle dogs presenting with myiasis were treated once with spinosad 560 mg, with dosages ranging from 43 to 577 mg/kg. Dogs were observed with 15 min post treatment, and with intervals of 15 min within the first hour followed by hourly evaluations up to six hours post-treatment. After this period, the remaining larvae were mechanically removed. Spontaneous expulsion of larvae was variable among dogs. All dogs received support treatment and were followed up for healing of the myiasis-associated lesion.
   On average, the highest larval expulsion occurred four hours after treatment. A single spinosad treatment had an overall efficacy of 79.7% (56.7-100%). The average larval expulsion rate was 73.3% (56.7-100%), reached its maximum within 6 h post-treatment, and the average larvicidal effect was only 23.7% (0-58.3%). No animal needed a second dosage 24 h post-treatment, lesions were completely healed within 8 days post-treatment. Despite not reaching the desirable 100% efficacy, spinosad treatment is an option in managing NSW myiasis, in conjunction with mechanical removal of maggots that remain in the lesion and support treatment.

AB The apicomplexan parasite Cystoisospora suis which causes neonatal porcine coccidiosis is one of the predominant parasite in suckling piglets. Currently, the immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) is the only available serological tool for detecting serum antibodies against C. suis which has several limitations, including bias from interpretation and low throughput. In the present study, an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed using a previously characterized recombinant merozoite protein for the detection of specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA against C. suis. The recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli as a N-terminal histidine fusion protein, and its specificity was confirmed in an immunoblot probed with highly positive anti-C. suis sera from experimentally infected piglets. Optimal dilutions of recombinant protein, sera and conjugate were determined by checkerboard titrations, and the serum dilution that gave the greatest ratio between the positive and the negative sera was selected for subsequent analyses. Agreement between the IFAT and the newly developed ELISA was assessed with kappa statistics. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis based on 185 serum samples with known C. suis exposure previously tested in the reference IFAT was used to determine the cut-off value, sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA. For IgG, the ELISA had an estimated cut-off value of 0.82 and sensitivity and specificity values of 94.7% and 98%, respectively, whereas for IgA the estimated cut-off value was 0.41 and sensitivity and specificity values were both100%. According to kappa coefficient, an excellent correlation (kappa > 0.8) was found between IFAT and ELISA for both isotypes. The diagnostic accuracy of the test measured as the area under the ROC curve index scaled between 0.98 and 1.0, indicating high discriminatory capacity and its possible application as a serological tool for detecting antibody response in the host following C. suis exposure/immunization and large-scale surveillance studies.

AB Spirocerca lupi is a parasitic nematode of canids and occurs in most tropical and subtropical regions around the world. While its life cycle is well known, insight is lacking about its mating structure within-hosts, genetic variability and long-distance dispersal ability. These characteristics contribute significantly to the dynamics and spread of potential resistance genes, which impacts on the control of S. lupi. To evaluate the population structure and infer potential mating behaviour of S. lupi, we genotyped 130 samples at nine microsatellite loci from three geographical locations in South Africa, between 600 and 1000 km apart. These loci identified unique individuals with high levels of polymorphism suggesting that these are not newly established S. lupi populations in South Africa and that effective population sizes must be large. Population genetic analyses showed that populations are not very distinct, that worms within dogs are more similar to each other than random worms from each population, and that mating is at random within dogs. We can thus infer that the parasite is frequently transported over great distances. Even so, two genetically distinct populations could be identified. Relatedness of worms within dogs were significantly higher than between dogs and together with F-statistics suggests some non-random transmission of parasites between hosts. While mating is random within a host, parasites from a host are more likely to be related and hence an increase in homozygosity is seen. The implications of this genetic structure on parasite control are considered.

AB Toxoplasma gondii has been described in several marine mammals around the world including numerous species of cetaceans, yet infection and transmission mechanisms in the marine environment are not clearly defined. The Israel Marine Mammal Research and Assistance Center has been collating a database of all marine mammal stranding events along the country's national coastlines since 1993. In this study, we describe the molecular detection and characterisation of T. gondii in three common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) including one case of coinfection with herpesvirus. The animals were found stranded on the Mediterranean coast of Israel in May and November 2013. In one of the three cases, the dolphin was found alive and admitted to intensive care. To our knowledge, this is the first report of T. gondii infection of marine mammals in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. As this parasite acts as an indicator for marine pollution and marine mammal health, we believe these findings add important information regarding the state of the environment in this region.

AB Ovine parasitic gastroenteritis is a complex disease routinely treated using anthelmintics. Although many different strongyle species may contribute to parasitic gastroenteritis, not all are equally pathogenic: in temperate regions, the primary pathogen is Teladorsagia circumcincta. In this study we investigated benzimidazole and ivermectin resistance on a commercial sheep farm in southeast Scotland. We assessed the impact of species diversity on the diagnosis of resistance using the faecal egg count reduction test and in vitro bioassays, and correlated the results with the frequency of benzimidazole resistance-associated genotypes measured in the T. circumcincta population by pyrosequencing of the beta-tubulin isotype-1 gene.
   Faecal egg count reduction test results showed efficacies of 65% for albendazole and 77% for ivermectin, indicating moderate resistance levels on the farm. However, PCR speciation of the same populations pre- and post-treatment revealed that removal of susceptible species had masked the presence of a highly resistant population of T. circwncincta. Less than 25% of individuals in the pre-treatment populations were T. circumcincta, the remainder consisting of Cooperia curticei, Chabertia ovina, Oesophagostomum venulosum and Trichostrongylus spp. In contrast, post-treatment with albendazole or ivermectin, the majority (88% and 100% respectively) of the populations consisted of T. circumcincta. The egg hatch test for benzimidazole resistance and the larval development test for ivermectin resistance were carried out using eggs obtained from the same populations and the results were broadly consistent with the faecal egg count reduction test. Thirty individual T. circumcincta from each sampling time point were assessed for benzimidazole resistance by pyrosequencing, revealing a high frequency and diversity of resistance-associated mutations, including within the population sampled post-ivermectin treatment.
   These results highlight the potential diversity of parasite species present on UK farms, and their importance in the diagnosis of anthelmintic resistance. On this particular farm, we demonstrate the presence of a highly dual-resistant population of T. circumcincta, which was strongly selected by treatment with either benzimidazoles or ivermectin, while other potentially less pathogenic species were removed.

AB Chickens exhibit varied responses to infection with Eimeria parasites. We hypothesise that broilers selected for increased growth rate will show lower resistance and tolerance to a coccidian challenge. 288 chickens of fast (F) or slow (S) growing lines were inoculated with 0 (control), 2500 (low-dose), or 7000 (high-dose) sporulated E. maxima oocysts at 13 days of age in two consecutive rounds. Gain and Intake were measured daily and their values relative to BW at the point of infection were calculated over the pre-patent (days 1-4 post-infection), acute (d5-8 pi), and recovery (d9-12 pi) phases of infection to assess the impact of infection. Levels of plasma carotenoids, vitamins E and A, long bone mineralisation, caecal microbiota diversity indices, and histological measurements were assessed at the acute (d6 pi) and recovery stage (d13 pi). In addition, we measured the levels of nitric oxide metabolites and the number of parasite genome copies in the jejunumat d6pi. In absolute terms F birds grew 1.42 times faster than S birds when not infected. Infection significantly reduced relative daily gain and intake (P < 0.001), with the effects being most pronounced during the acute phase (P < 0.001). Levels of all metabolites were significantly decreased, apart from NO which increased (P < 0.001) in response to infection on d6pi, and were accompanied by changes in histomorphometric features and the presence of E. maxima genome copies in infected birds, which persisted to dl3pi. Furthermore, infection reduced tibia and femur mineralisation, which also persisted to dl3pi. Reductions in measured variables were mostly independent of dose size, as was the level of parasite replication. The impact of infection was similar for S and F-line birds for all measured parameters, and there were no significant interactions between line x dose size on any of these parameters. In conclusion, our results suggest that line differences in productive performance do not influence host responses to coccidiosis when offered nutrient adequate diets.

AB Spinetoram is the newest member the spinosyn-class of natural products to be commercialized for flea control on cats in the United States under the tradename Cheristin (R) for cats. This report describes results from two laboratory studies and a multi-center clinical field trial designed to confirm the efficacy of a topical spot-on solution containing spinetoram (11.2% w/w, 130 mg/mL) against European strains of the cat flea, Ctenocephalides fells.
   In the laboratory studies, cats were allocated to one of two treatment groups of eight animals each: negative control (mineral oil) or spinetoram, both applied as a topical spot-on at the base of the skull on Day 0. Cats were infested with 100 newly emerged, unfed adult fleas on Days -2 or -1, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35. To calculate efficacy, fleas were counted and removed 48 h after treatment, and 48 h after each subsequent infestation through week 5. Spinetoram treatments provided 100% efficacy through at least day 16 and >= 97% efficacy (arithmetic mean) for one month.
   For the field trial, 23 clinics from Northern and Southern Europe participated in the study that compared the effectiveness and safety of spinetoram and fipronil/(S)-methoprene treatments over a period of two months. There were 258 and 248 evaluable efficacy cases for month 1 and month 2, respectively, with 300 total evaluable cases for safety. Treatments were administered on Day 0 and again on Day 30 ( 3 days). The effectiveness of treatments was calculated based on reduction in live flea counts on Days 14, 30, 44 and 60 ( 3 days) relative to flea counts obtained on Day 0. Efficacy (geometric mean percent flea reduction) on Days 14, 30, 44 and 60 was 97.0%, 95.0%, 99.3% and 99.1% for spinetoram, respectively, and 86.1%, 80.9%, 92.4% and 92.3% for fipronil/ (S)-methoprene, respectively. Spinetoram was deemed non-inferior at all intervals and superior to fipronil/(S)-methoprene at Days 30 and 60. Clinical signs of flea allergy dermatitis (FAD) were markedly improved following spinetoram treatment, as demonstrated through statistically significant reductions in severity of FAD scores for most of the clinical signs when compared to flpronil/(S)-methoprene treatment. There was a lower overall adverse event incidence rate for spinetoram (5.1%) versus fipronil/(S)-methoprene treatment (11.5%).

AB Refractile body protein, SO7, is a highly immunogenic protein which is essentially involved in the early development of Eimeria species infecting the domestic chicken. In the present study, the immune response and protective efficacy of recombinant Eimeria tenella SO7 (rEtSO7) protein was assessed in broiler chickens following homologous oocyst challenge. Broiler chicks were subcutaneously immunized with rEtSO7 antigen adjuvanted with Montanide ISA 71 VG on 7 and 21 days of age and protective efficacy of vaccination was evaluated in terms of body weight gain, lesion score and reduction in oocyst output. The peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation, serum IgY response, and levels of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin 2 (IL-2), interleukin 4 (IL-4), tumor growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and nitric oxide (NO) were assessed. The results revealed significant reduction (p < 0.05) in the oocyst output and increased weight gain in immunized birds as compared to unimmunized birds. Significantly increased levels of serum IgY, IFN-gamma and proliferation of lymphocytes were evident in rEtSO7 immunized chickens. The results demonstrated that the recombinant protein could effectively elicit the cellular and humoral immune responses in immunized chickens, and provided significant protection against caecal coccidiosis in chickens.

AB E. mitis is ubiquitous in clinical coccidiosis caused by mixed infection of Eimeria species and the infection by E. mitts usually significantly impairs productivity of the infected chickens. To date, however, few protective antigens from E. mills have been reported. In this study, the molecular characterization and protective efficacy of microneme 3 of Eimeria mitis (EmiMIC3) were analyzed. EmiMIC3 gene was cloned from sporozoites of E. mitis and its MARs (microneme adhesive repeats domain) were predicted. Recombinant EmiMIC3 (rEmiMIC3) was expressed in E. colt and purified and then was analyzed by western blot with anti-E. mitis chicken serum. Meanwhile, native EmiMIC3 from sporozoites was analyzed by anti-rEmiMIC3 rat serum. The expressions of EmiMIC3 in E. mitts sporozoites and merozoites were analyzed by immunofluorescence assay. The rEmiMIC3-induced changes of T lymphocytes subpopulation, serum cytokines and IgY levels and the protective efficacy of rEmiMIC3 were determined in animal experiments. The results showed that the deduced open reading frame (ORF) of EmiMIC3 was composed of 1145 amino acids, possessing 9 MARs. EmiMIC3 gene was submitted to GenBank (accession number: MG888670). EmiMIC3 could express in sporozoites and merozoites respectively and located at the apex of E. mitis sporozoite. Western blot assay revealed that the rEmiMIC3 could be recognized by serum of chicken infected by E. odds and the native EmiMIC3 from sporozoites could also be recognized by rat serum against rEmiMIC3. Following vaccination with rEmiMIC3, higher levels of IL-10, IFN-gamma, TGF-beta and IL-17, higher proportions of CD4 + /CD3 + and CD8 + /CD3 + T lymphocytes and higher level of IgY antibody were induced compared to the controls. Vaccination with rEmiMIC3 prominently increased the weight gains and decreased oocyst output of the vaccinated chickens after challenge infection. Our result not only enriches protective candidate antigen of E. odds, but also provides available protective antigen of E. mills for the development of multivalent vaccines against infection caused by mixture of Eimeria species in clinical coccidiosis.

AB A series of placebo-controlled trials were conducted in horses, cattle and goats in different seasons and bioclimatic regions of New South Wales and Queensland, Australia, to evaluate the ability of BioWorma (R), a feed supplement containing the spores of Duddingtonia fiagrans IAH 1297, to reduce the larval development of parasitic gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) and their subsequent migration from faeces onto the surrounding pasture.
   In each trial, faeces were collected from animals harbouring a burden of nematode parasites following a period of supplementation with a placebo and again after supplementation with BioWorma. The faeces were manually placed onto pasture plots at one or two distinct geographical sites and the effect of treatment was determined by subsequent monitoring the numbers of parasitic larvae on the pasture surrounding the faecal pats at two weekly intervals over an eight week period. The results for these studies showed that administration of BioWorma at a minimum daily dose of 3 x 10(4) spores/kg bodyweight reduced parasite larvae in the pasture surrounding the faeces by 53-99 % over an eight week post treatment period in horses, cattle and goats in a range of bioclimatic zones and in different seasons.
   Overall, the studies with BioWorma show substantial reductions in GIN infectivity of pasture surrounding faeces of treated horses, cattle and goats (P < 0.05). Results indicate that the use of BioWorma in these host species would lead to decreased levels of GIN infection in animals grazing pasture when this product is used and would provide an alternative means of controlling parasitic nematodes.

AB Toxoplasmosis in marine mammals is epidemiologically and clinically important. Toxoplasma gondii antibodies (by modified agglutination test, cut-off >= 1:25) were detected in serum of 65 of 70 (92.9%) northern sea otters (Enhydra lutris kenyoni) from Washington State, USA. Brains and/or muscles of 44 sea otters were bioassayed in mice (INF-gamma knock-out [KO], Swiss Webster outbred [SW]) and viable T. gondii was isolated from 22 of 44 (50%); T. gondii strains were lethal to KO mice but not SW mice. These T. gondii isolates were further propagated in cell culture. Multi-locus PCR-RFLP genotyping of cell culture-derived tachyzoites revealed four different genotypes among 22 isolates including ToxoDB PCR-RFLP genotype #5 (14 isolates), #1 (three isolates), #3 (four isolates), and #167 (one isolate). PCR-DNA sequencing based genotyping using polymorphic gene GRA6 revealed one of four different alleles. Among the 14 RFLP genotype #5 strains, 10 have GRA6 sequences that match with the Type A, one match with the Type X, two strains did not generate sequence data, and one strain had double peaks at known polymorphic sites indicating a mixed infection. The seven strains belong to genotypes #1 and #3, all have identical sequences to T. gondii Type II reference isolate ME49. Genotype #167 strain has identical sequence to Type I reference strain. In summary, we observed high seroprevalence, and high rate of isolation of T. gondii from northern sea otters and predominant genotype #5 that has been previously reported a dominant and widespread strain among terrestrial wildlife in North America. GRA6 sequence analysis of the genotype #5 isolates indicated the dominance of Type A lineage in sea otters in Washington State.

AB A 12-year-old, female, domestic cat (Felts catus) presented with dehydration, emaciation, anorexia, and lethargy. The cat was unresponsive to medical treatment and euthanized; the carcass was submitted for pathological diagnosis. Necropsy revealed icteric mucous membranes. The liver was enlarged, with multinodular, cystic, white masses, 0.5-4.0 cm in diameter, scattered throughout. Microscopically, the biliary epithelium presented with a proliferation of multifocal cystic masses, occasionally with periodic acid-Schiff-positive fluid within the cysts. Simple cuboidal epithelial cells showed small, round to oval, vesicular nuclei and rare mitotic figures. There were also multifocal trematode-like parasites situated within the biliary tracts. Immunohistochemistry of the cystic masses was positive for pan-cytokeratin and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, while negative for vimentin. Molecular analysis and gene sequencing of the parasite indicated that it was Opisthorchis viverrini. Based on the pathological findings and molecular analysis, the cat was diagnosed with biliary cystadenoma related to O. viverrini infection. This report described an unusual case of O. viverrini infection associated with biliary tumor in a cat, and raises the possibility of domestic cats as a reservoir host of the human liver fluke.

AB We present a parallel method for solving the eikonal equation associated with level set redistancing. Fast marching [1,2] and fast sweeping [3] are the most popular redistancing methods due to their efficiency and relative simplicity. However, these methods require propagation of information from the zero-isocontour outwards, and this data dependence complicates efficient implementation on today's multiprocessor hardware. Recently an interesting alternative view has been developed that utilizes the Hopf-Lax formulation of the solution to the eikonal equation [4,5]. In this approach, the signed distance at an arbitrary point is obtained without the need of distance information from neighboring points. We extend the work of Lee et al. [4] to redistance functions defined via interpolation over a regular grid. The grid-based definition is essential for practical application in level set methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with GPU parallelism on a number of representative examples. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present an efficient formulation of the boundary element method (BEM) for calculation of two-dimensional pressure-driven Stokes flow in a doubly-periodic domain. In contrast to similar methods which require a priori knowledge of the mean fluid velocity, this formulation is based on knowledge of the mean pressure gradient only. We present a method of calculating the permeability tensor without the need to specify either mean velocity or pressure gradient. We discuss optimality of the splitting parameter in the doubly-periodic Green's function, with regard to the numerical overhead required for the BEM, and in most cases find a 3-10 fold increase in computational efficiency compared to the splitting parameter used in standard BEM formulations.

AB The Finite Volume method with Exact two-material Riemann Problems (FIVER) is both a computational framework for multi-material flows characterized by large density jumps, and an Embedded Boundary Method (EBM) for computational fluid dynamics and highly nonlinear Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problems. This paper deals with the EBM aspect of FIVER. For FSI problems, this EBM has already demonstrated the ability to address viscous effects along wall boundaries, and large deformations and topological changes of such boundaries. However, like for most EBMs - also known as immersed boundary methods - the performance of FIVER in the vicinity of a wall boundary can be sensitive with respect to the position and orientation of this boundary relative to the embedding mesh. This is mainly due to ill-conditioning issues that arise when an embedded interface becomes too close to a node of the embedding mesh, which may lead to spurious oscillations in the computed solution gradients at the wall boundary. This paper resolves these issues by introducing an alternative definition of the active/inactive status of a mesh node that leads to the removal of all sources of potential ill-conditioning from all spatial approximations performed by FIVER in the vicinity of a fluid-structure interface. It also makes two additional contributions. The first one is a new procedure for constructing the fluid-structure half Riemann problem underlying the semi-discretization by FIVER of the convective fluxes. This procedure eliminates one extrapolation from the conventional treatment of the wall boundary conditions and replaces it by an interpolation, which improves robustness. The second contribution is a post-processing algorithm for computing quantities of interest at the wall that achieves smoothness in the computed solution and its gradients. Lessons learned from these enhancements and contributions that are triggered by the new definition of the status of a mesh node are then generalized and exploited to eliminate from the original version of the FIVER method its sensitivities with respect to both of the position and orientation of the wall boundary relative to the embedding mesh, while maintaining the original definition of the status of a mesh node. This leads to a family of second-generation FIVER methods whose performance is illustrated in this paper for several flow and FSI problems. These include a challenging flow problem over a bird wing characterized by a feather-induced surface roughness, and a complex flexible flapping wing problem for which experimental data is available.

AB This work introduces a novel discontinuity-tracking framework for resolving discontinuous solutions of conservation laws with high-order numerical discretizations that support inter-element solution discontinuities, such as discontinuous Galerkin or finite volume methods. The proposed method aims to align inter-element boundaries with discontinuities in the solution by deforming the computational mesh. A discontinuity-aligned mesh ensures the discontinuity is represented through inter-element jumps while smooth basis functions interior to elements are only used to approximate smooth regions of the solution, thereby avoiding Gibbs' phenomena that create well-known stability issues. Therefore, very coarse high-order discretizations accurately resolve the piecewise smooth solution throughout the domain, provided the discontinuity is tracked. Central to the proposed discontinuity-tracking framework is a discrete PDE-constrained optimization formulation that simultaneously aligns the computational mesh with discontinuities in the solution and solves the discretized conservation law on this mesh. The optimization objective is taken as a combination of the deviation of the finite-dimensional solution from its element-wise average and a mesh distortion metric to simultaneously penalize Gibbs' phenomena and distorted meshes. It will be shown that our objective function satisfies two critical properties that are required for this discontinuity-tracking framework to be practical: (1) possesses a local minima at a discontinuity-aligned mesh and (2) decreases monotonically to this minimum in a neighborhood of radius approximately h/2, whereas other popular discontinuity indicators fail to satisfy the latter. Another important contribution of this work is the observation that traditional reduced space PDE-constrained optimization solvers that repeatedly solve the conservation law at various mesh configurations are not viable in this context since severe overshoot and undershoot in the solution, i.e., Gibbs' phenomena, may make it impossible to solve the discrete conservation law on non-aligned meshes. Therefore, we advocate a gradient-based, full space solver where the mesh and conservation law solution converge to their optimal values simultaneously and therefore never require the solution of the discrete conservation law on a non-aligned mesh. The merit of the proposed method is demonstrated on a number of one- and two-dimensional model problems including the L-2 projection of discontinuous functions, Burgers' equation with a discontinuous source term, transonic flow through a nozzle, and supersonic flow around a bluff body. We demonstrate optimal O(h(P+1)) convergence rates in the L-1 norm for up to polynomial order p = 6 and show that accurate solutions can be obtained on extremely coarse meshes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper, a segregated algorithm is proposed to suppress high-frequency oscillations in the velocity field for incompressible flows. In this context, a new velocity formula based on a reconstruction of face fluxes is defined eliminating high-frequency errors. In analogy to the Rhie-Chow interpolation, this approach is equivalent to including a flux-based pressure gradient with a velocity diffusion in the momentum equation. In order to guarantee second-order accuracy of the numerical solver, a set of conditions are defined for the reconstruction operator. To arrive at the final formulation, an outlook over the state of the art regarding velocity reconstruction procedures is presented comparing them through an error analysis. A new operator is then obtained by means of a flux difference minimization satisfying the required spatial accuracy. The accuracy of the new algorithm is analyzed by performing mesh convergence studies for unsteady Navier-Stokes problems with analytical solutions. The stabilization properties of the solver are then tested in a problem where spurious numerical oscillations arise for the velocity field. The results show a remarkable performance of the proposed technique eliminating high-frequency errors without losing accuracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We study the problem of reconstructing a function on a manifold satisfying some mild conditions, given data of the values and some derivatives of the function at arbitrary points on the manifold. While the problem of finding a polynomial of two variables with total degree <= n given the values of the polynomial and some of its derivatives at exactly the same number of points as the dimension of the polynomial space is sometimes impossible, we show that such a problem always has a solution in a very general situation if the degree of the polynomials is sufficiently large. We give estimates on how large the degree should be, and give explicit constructions for such a polynomial even in a far more general case. As the number of sampling points at which the data is available increases, our polynomials converge to the target function on the set where the sampling points are dense. Numerical examples in single and double precision show that this method is stable, efficient, and of high-order. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We consider a 1D-2V Vlasov-Fokker-Planck multi-species ionic description coupled to fluid electrons. We address temporal stiffness with implicit time stepping, suitably preconditioned. To address temperature disparity in time and space, we extend the conservative adaptive velocity-space discretization scheme proposed in [Taitano et al., J. Comput. Phys., 318,391-420, (2016)] to a spatially inhomogeneous system. In this approach, we normalize the velocity-space coordinate to a temporally and spatially varying local characteristic speed per species. We explicitly consider the resulting inertial terms in the Vlasov equation, and derive a discrete formulation that conserves mass, momentum, and energy up to a prescribed nonlinear tolerance upon convergence. Our conservation strategy employs nonlinear constraints to enforce these properties discretely for both the Vlasov operator and the Fokker-Planck collision operator. Numerical examples of varying degrees of complexity, including shock-wave propagation, demonstrate the favorable efficiency and accuracy properties of the scheme. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The Discrete Velocity Method (DVM) for solving the Boltzmann equation has significant advantages in the modeling of non-equilibrium and near equilibrium flows as compared to other methods in terms of reduced statistical noise, faster solutions and the ability to handle transient flows. Yet the DVM performance for rarefied flow in complex, small-scale geometries, in microelectromechanical (MEMS) devices for instance, is yet to be studied in detail. The present study focuses on the performance of the DVM for locally large Knudsen number flows of argon around sharp corners and other sources for discontinuities in the distribution function. Our analysis details the nature of the solution for some benchmark cases and introduces the concept of solution convergence for the transport terms in the discrete velocity Boltzmann equation. The limiting effects of the velocity space discretization are also investigated and the constraints on obtaining a robust, consistent solution are derived. We propose techniques to maintain solution convergence and demonstrate the implementation of a specific strategy and its effect on the fidelity of the solution for some benchmark cases.

AB The conditional quadrature method of moments (CQMOM) was introduced by Yuan and Fox (2011) [4] to reconstruct a velocity distribution function (VDF) from a finite set of its integer moments. The reconstructed VDF takes the form of a sum of weighted Dirac delta functions in velocity phase space, and provides a closure for the spatial flux term in the corresponding kinetic equation. The CQMOM closure for the flux leads to a weakly hyperbolic system of moment equations. In subsequent work by Chalons et al. (2010) [8], the Dirac delta functions were replaced by Gaussian distributions, which make the moment system hyperbolic but at the added cost of dealing with continuous distributions. Here, a hyperbolic version of CQMOM is proposed that uses weighted Dirac delta functions. While the moment set employed for multi-Gaussian and conditional HyQMOM (CHyQMOM) are equivalent, the latter is able to access all of moment space whereas the former cannot (e.g. arbitrary values of the fourth-order velocity moment in 1-D phase space with two nodes). By making use of the properties of CHyQMOM in 2-D phase space, it is possible to control a symmetrical subset of the optimal moments from Fox (2009) [24]. Furthermore, the moment sets for 2-D problems are smaller for CHyQMOM than in the original CQMOM thanks to a judicious choice of the velocity abscissas in phase space. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB We consider interior and exterior initial boundary value problems for the three-dimensional wave (d'Alembert) equation. First, we reduce a given problem to an equivalent operator equation with respect to unknown sources defined only at the boundary of the original domain. In doing so, the Huygens' principle enables us to obtain the operator equation in a form that involves only finite and non-increasing pre-history of the solution in time. Next, we discretize the resulting boundary equation and solve it efficiently by the method of difference potentials (MDP). The overall numerical algorithm handles boundaries of general shape using regular structured grids with no deterioration of accuracy. For long simulation times it offers sub-linear complexity with respect to the grid dimension, i.e., is asymptotically cheaper than the cost of a typical explicit scheme. In addition, our algorithm allows one to share the computational cost between multiple similar problems. On multiprocessor (multi-core) platforms, it benefits from what can be considered an effective parallelization in time. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The structure of many multiphase systems is governed by an energy that penalizes the area of interfaces between phases weighted by surface tension coefficients. However, interface evolution laws depend also on interface mobility coefficients. Having in mind some applications where highly contrasted or even degenerate mobilities are involved, for which classical phase field models are inapplicable, we propose a new effective phase field approach to approximate multiphase mean curvature flows with mobilities. The key aspect of our model is to incorporate the mobilities not in the phase field energy (which is conventionally the case) but in the metric which determines the gradient flow. We show the consistency of such an approach by a formal analysis of the sharp interface limit. We also propose an efficient numerical scheme which allows us to illustrate the advantages of the model on various examples, as the wetting of droplets on solid surfaces or the simulation of nanowires growth generated by the so-called vapor-liquid-solid method.

AB Numerical simulation of the acoustic wave equation in either isotropic or anisotropic media is crucial to seismic modeling, imaging and inversion. Actually, it represents the core computation cost of these highly advanced seismic processing methods. However, the conventional finite-difference method suffers from severe numerical dispersion errors and S-wave artifacts when solving the acoustic wave equation for anisotropic media. We propose a method to obtain the finite-difference coefficients by comparing its numerical dispersion with the exact form. We find the optimal finite difference coefficients that share the dispersion characteristics of the exact equation with minimal dispersion error. The method is extended to solve the acoustic wave equation in transversely isotropic (TI) media without S-wave artifacts. Numerical examples show that the method is highly accurate and efficient.

The methods are tested with uniform particle distributions in particular against a recent multi-resolution wavelet based method on a 4D plasma instability case and a 6D gravitational case. Conservation properties, accuracy and computational costs are monitored. The excellent accuracy/cost trade-off shown by the method opens new perspective for accurate simulations of high dimensional kinetic equations by particle methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper presents an adjoint Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) coupled with the Level-Set Method (LSM) for topology optimization of thermal fluid flows. The adjoint-state formulation implies discrete velocity directions in order to take into account the LBM boundary conditions. These boundary conditions are introduced at the beginning of the adjoint-state method as the LBM residuals, so that the adjoint-state boundary conditions can appear directly during the adjoint-state equation formulation. The proposed method is tested with 3 numerical examples concerning thermal fluid flows, but with different objectives: minimization of the mean temperature in the domain, maximization of the heat evacuated by the fluid, and maximization of the heat exchange with heated solid parts. This latter example, treated in several articles, is used to validate our method. In these optimization problems, a limitation of the maximal pressure drop and of the porosity (number of fluid elements) is also applied. The obtained results demonstrate that the method is robust and effective for solving topology optimization of thermal fluid flows. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The aim of this study is to propose a hybrid biogas upgrading configuration composed of two-stage thermophilic reactors. Hydrogen is directly injected in the first stage reactor. The output gas from the first reactor (in-situ biogas upgrade) is subsequently transferred to a second upflow reactor (ex-situ upgrade), in which enriched hydrogenotrophic culture is responsible for the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to methane. The overall objective of the work was to perform an initial methane enrichment in the in-situ reactor, avoiding deterioration of the process due to elevated pH levels, and subsequently, to complete the biogas upgrading process in the ex-situ chamber. The methane content in the first stage reactor reached on average 87% and the corresponding value in the second stage was 91%, with a maximum of 95%. A remarkable accumulation of volatile fatty acids was observed in the first reactor (in-situ) after 8 days of continuous hydrogen injection reaching a concentration of 5.6 g/L. Nevertheless, after an adaptation period, the system managed to recover and the volatile fatty acids decreased to 2.5 g/L. No pH drop was recorded during the period characterised by increased volatile fatty acids concentration mainly due to the consumption of the endogenous carbon dioxide by hydrogenotrophic methanogens. The effect of hydrogen injection on the microbial community in both reactors was analysed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The results demonstrated an increment in relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens and homoacetogens in the in-situ reactor, while the microbial community in the ex-situ chamber was simpler and dominated by hydrogenotrophic methanogens.

AB An adaptive operation strategy for on-demand control of active direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) is proposed as an alternative method to enhance the voltage stability. A simplified semi-empirical model is firstly developed to describe I-V relationships based on uniform-designed experiments. It is then embedded into multi-objective optimizations to construct the adaptive operation strategy. Experimental studies are implemented on different DMFC systems to validate the proposed semi-empirical model, control strategy and system response to operational adjustments. Numerical simulations are also performed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of the proposed adaptive operation strategy. The results show that the adaptive operation strategy provides possibilities for voltage stability enhancement without the sacrifice of energy conversion efficiency. The adaptive operations are also found to be able to extend the range of operating current density or to decrease the voltage deviation according to ones requirements. Moreover, the response of DMFCs to operational adjustments is quick, which further validates the effectiveness and feasibility of the adaptive operation strategy in practical applications. The proposed strategy contributes to a guideline for the better control of output voltage from operating DMFC systems.

AB A CFD model of hydrogen-enriched gasoline Wankel rotary engine is established and validated. The mixture formation and combustion processes are investigated under both hydrogen port and direct injection enrichment conditions with different hydrogen addition levels. It was found that, under hydrogen port injection enrichment conditions, the peak in-cylinder pressure of 6% is 8.4% higher that of 3%. Meanwhile, under hydrogen direct injection enrichment conditions, the peak in-cylinder pressure of 3% hydrogen direct injection enrichment is 15.3% higher than that of 3% hydrogen port injection enrichment. It was also found that the mainstream field with same direction of rotor rotation is formed during the compression stroke and a vortex with high vorticity existed in the combustion chamber. With the effects of mainstream field and vortex, the hydrogen fills more than half volume of the entire combustion chamber under 4%, 5% and 6% HDIE conditions. At the same time, a local low velocity zone is formed around the vortex because the hydrogen direct injection flow slows down the dissipation of vortex. According to the analysis by PREMIX, the fastest flame speed is achieved at equivalence ratios around 1.4. The proper rich hydrogen region distribution is obtained under 4%, 5% and 6% hydrogen direct injection enrichment conditions. Both the enhanced flame propagation by proper equivalence ratio distribution and the reduced local mainstream flow velocity by vortex existence contribute to solving the unburned zone problem. Compared with 6% hydrogen port injection enrichment, the maximum value of in-cylinder pressure of 4%, 5% and 6% hydrogen direct injection enrichment is improved by 59.6%, 88.4% and 91.6%, respectively. However, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide emissions are increased obviously. As a relatively low carbon monoxide emission is obtained with 4% case under hydrogen direct injection enrichment conditions and the problem of unburned zone in the rear region of combustion chamber is solved. The hydrogen volume fraction of 4% with direct injection enrichment achieves the best engine performance in this study.

AB As an energy comprehensive utilization technology, combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system has received much attention in many countries. Due to the variability of users demand, the CCHP system is often running at off-design condition. CCHP system integrated with energy storage system is an efficient method to improve the off-design performance of CCHP system. A novel CCHP system with trigenerative compressed air energy storage (T-CAES) is proposed in the paper, which can meet various forms energy demand of users. A comprehensive thermodynamic model of the system has been set up, and the thermodynamic performance analysis has been done. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is conducted by the key parameters effected on performance of CCHP system integrated with T-CAES. The comparison of thermodynamic and economic analysis between the novel CCHP system and conventional CCHP system are carried out in application of office building. The primary energy rate of novel CCHP system is 85.57%, the primary energy saving ratio of novel CCHP system is 26.87%, and the total cost saving ratio of novel CCHP system is 30.55%. The result shows that the performance of the CCHP system integrated with T-CAES is superior to conventional CCHP system.

AB In the context of renewable sources exploitation, the thermochemical conversion of biomass may give a significant contribution to the flexible and programmable production of electric and thermal power. From this perspective, the biomass fast pyrolysis conversion process is more than a promising technology but only few models have been developed so far to describe the behavior of a screw reactor system. This paper is thus focused on numerical modeling of a shaftless screw fast pyrolyzer with special attention on the residence time distribution and the definition of the kinetic framework, as well as the heat and mass transfer phenomena representation. A steady-state model with constant wall temperature has been developed to generate temperature profile and conversion patterns along the reactor. Residence Time Distribution evaluation has been developed as well to take into account non-ideal mass conveying characteristics of the proposed reactor design. The reaction framework, considering the conductive, convective and radiative heat transfer mechanisms, is based on a 4 parallel Distributed Activation Energy Model. The structure includes the three major biomass pseudo-component occurring in the biomass thermal degradation, namely cellulose hemicellulose and lignin, together with the moisture evaporation process. The numerical results are compared with results collected experimentally from the fast pyrolysis of spent coffee grounds in a lab-scale screw reactor. Numerical temperature profiles for both the gas and solid phase are in good agreement with the experimental ones. The peak bio-oil production has been observed in the range of 500 degrees C. The results also show a strong dependence of results on wall temperature and gas-solid heating rate.

AB In this paper, a novel modified ejection-compression refrigeration cycle is studied and compared with conventional ejection-compression refrigeration cycle based on exergetic and economic analyses. The novel cycle is expected to improve the low practicability of conventional ejection-compression cycle with better thermal efficiency, smaller solar collector and more excellent economic performance. Energy performance is simply evaluated based on thermal efficiency and global coefficient of performance. The results show the novel cycle is better in both the two indicators, which confirmed that it needs much less solar heat and smaller collector, and has better practicability. With the above data, exergy analysis is performed, showing the total exergy destruction of the novel cycle is 23.97 kW less than a conventional cycle and exergy efficiency of the novel cycle is always higher than the conventional cycle in the studied range. Economic analyses taking into consideration the impact of carbon dioxide emission are finished under base case. The results reveal the novel cycle has a total cost rate 24.4% lower and a solar collector 89.5% smaller than those of a conventional cycle. The economic advantage of the novel cycle will remain, even both electricity price and carbon dioxide penalty cost increase to 3.1 times of the current price. These improvements in energy and economy indicate the novel cycle has an excellent application potential.

AB Solar energy is an important renewable energy resource for many Arabic countries. The solar chimney is considered as one of the feasible solar energy conversion techniques. The present work introduces a detailed numerical investigation and optimization of the solar chimney power density under different operating conditions. The finite volume CFD code ANSYS Fluent was implemented in the present work. The solar irradiance was modeled using the discrete ordinates (DO) radiation model. The present numerical simulation shows that the chimney collector has an optimum radius that strongly depends on the operating solar irradiance. Moreover, the turbine pressure drop significantly affects the collector performance. Increasing the turbine pressure drop increases the value of the optimum collector radius. Equations for estimating the optimum collector radius, efficiency, and power density were obtained and presented. The present investigation shows an optimum collector radius of 17 times the chimney radius at an irradiance of 500 W/m(2) using a turbine with a pressure drop of 160 Pa. An aero-economical optimization of the collector radius is recommended for future work.

AB Considering the drawbacks of a diesel/natural gas dual-fuel combustion at low load usually is relative to undesirable natural gas-air-diesel mixture distributions in-cylinder and natural gas supply method and pilot diesel injection strategy are believed to play a critical role in the process of mixture formation in the cylinder. So an experimental study has been conducted to explore the effects of natural gas injection timing and split pilot injection strategy on the combustion performance and emissions characteristics in a diesel/natural gas dual-fuel engine.
   In this study, the effects of natural gas injection timing under a constant split pilot injection strategy and a varying first pilot injection timing under an optimized natural gas injection timing on combustion performance and emissions are evaluated. The cylinder pressure, Heat Release Rate (HRR), Pressure Rise Rate (PRR), ignition delay, flame development duration, CA50 and combustion duration as well as THC, CO, NOx emissions are analyzed for the purpose.
   The experimental results indicated that natural gas injection timing and split injection strategy have a significant influence on the combustion performance and emissions characteristics in the dual-fuel engine. The natural gas premixed combustion stage can be enhanced with retarded natural gas injection timing. The pilot diesel combustion stage is weakened under the split injection strategy and the combustion process can be improved by reasonably advanced first pilot injection timing. Moreover, combined variation natural gas injection timing and split pilot injection strategy is a potential way to optimize the performance of the diesel/natural gas dual-fuel engine.

AB The concept of year-round biogas production to increase the capacity factor of anaerobic digestion (AD) plants in sugarcane biorefineries was investigated for the first time in semi-continuous feeding mode. To simulate the use of sugarcane vinasse during the sugarcane season and sugarcane filter cake (SFC) during the off-season period, a two-stage reactor system based on an acidogenic continuous stirred-tank reactor (1st stage) followed by solid-liquid separation and an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor (2nd stage) to convert the COD-rich liquid fraction into biogas was operated. Additionally, to optimize the biogas production from SFC, the effects of its thermo-chemical pre-treatment on AD were investigated in a parallel reactor set-up. The saponification effect provided by autoclaving the substrate with sodium hydroxide improved the hydrolysis/fermentation of SFC in the acidogenic reactor, which in turn resulted in a 28% higher volumetric methane production in the methanogenic reactor (p < 0.05). However, the methane yields observed during operation of the two-stage reactor system were markedly lower than previously found in biochemical methane potential tests using SFC. In this case, the feed-in with low suspended solids required by UASB reactors prevented the utilization of the non-hydrolyzed/fermented solid fraction of SFC ( >60% of the substrate's methane potential). Nevertheless, the capacity factor of the AD plants in sugarcane biorefineries could be increased from 0.55 up to 0.69 when considering a 200 d a (-1) sugarcane season (0.66-0.83 for a longer season of 240 d a (-1)), representing an increase of 25.7%. The average capacity factor for biogas combined heat and power and upgrading units of around 0.91 (8000 h a (-1)) would be reached if further developments could improve the solubilization of non-hydrolyzed/fermented solids or alternatively allow their direct use in the methanogenic reactor.

TI Brayton cycles as waste heat recovery systems on series hybrid electric
   vehicles

AB In the global attempt to increase the powertrain overall efficiency of hybrid vehicles while reducing the battery size, engine waste heat recovery (WHR) systems are nowadays promising technologies. This is in particular interesting for series hybrid electric vehicles (SHEV), as the engine operates at a relative high load and under steady conditions. Therefore, the resulting high exhaust gas temperature presents the advantage of increased WHR efficiency. The Brayton cycle offers a relatively reduced weight compared to other WHR systems and presents a low complexity for integration in vehicles since it relies on an open system architecture with air as the working fluid, which consequently avoids the need for a condenser compared to the Rankine cycle. This paper investigates the potential of fuel consumption savings of a SHEV using the Brayton cycle as a WHR system from the internal combustion engine (ICE) exhaust gases. An exergy analysis is conducted on the simple Brayton cycle and several Brayton waste heat recovery (BWHR) systems were identified. A SHEV with ICE-BWHR systems is modeled, where the recovered engine waste heat is converted into electricity using an electric generator and stored in the vehicle battery. The energy consumption simulations is performed on the worldwide-harmonized light-vehicles test cycle (WLTC) while considering the additional weight of the BWHR systems. The intercooled Brayton cycle (IBC) architecture is identified as the most promising for automotive applications as it offers the most convenient compromise between high efficiency and low integration complexity. Results show that 5.5% and 7.0% improved fuel economy on plug-in and self-sustaining SHEV configurations respectively when compared to similar vehicle configurations with ICE auxiliary power units. In addition to the fuel economy improvements, the IBC-WHR system offers other intrinsic advantages such as low noise, low vibration, high durability which makes it a potential heat recovery system for integration in SHEV.

AB The cycle model of an alkali metal thermal electric converter (AMTEC) is updated, where the relation between the thickness of the electrolyte and the other parameters of the AMTEC is established. The effects of thickness of the electrolyte on the performance of the AMTEC are discussed. The operation states of the AMTEC are optimized. The maximum efficiency and power output density of the AMTEC are calculated. The selective criteria of the thickness of the electrolyte and other parameters are optimally provided. Moreover, it is expounded that the proportional coefficient related to the thickness of the electrolyte is closely dependent on electrolyte materials. The effects of this coefficient on the efficiency and power output density of the AMTEC are further discussed, and consequently, the rational range of the coefficient is determined.

AB Heat pump technologies play significant roles in building energy saving and emission reduction. Combing the opposite characteristics of the electrical and absorption heat pumps, a novel internally hybrid absorption compression heat pump was proposed for performance improvement. The thermodynamic models for the hybrid heat pump using two cycles (single-effect and generator-absorber-heat-exchange) were built for component design and performance simulation with various refrigerant distribution ratios. Results show that a higher absorption-side refrigerant ratio generally makes the primary energy efficiency less sensitive and the capacity more sensitive to working condition. In the heating mode, a higher absorption-side refrigerant ratio brings about a higher efficiency when the evaporator inlet temperature is below 16 degrees C and 20 degrees C for the two cycles. In the cooling mode, a lower absorption-side refrigerant ratio contributes to a higher efficiency. The hybrid absorption compression heat pumps can realize flexible heating/cooling capacity ratios to accommodate the design heating/cooling loads as necessary. Generally, a higher absorption-side refrigerant ratio is preferred in colder conditions owing to the higher heating efficiency and the higher heating/cooling capacity ratio, well matching the heating dominant building loads. This study focuses on the principle and performance of the novel hybrid heat pump, the applications in actual buildings will be conducted through year-round simulations in future studies.

AB In this paper, the energy and exergy performance of several polygeneration arrangements driven by low and medium temperature geothermal resource is investigated. The aim is to assess and compare different coupling schemes, identifying suitable thermally driven technologies for each type of arrangement. The polygeneration system is intended to produce power, cooling and heat for direct uses by considering variations of series and parallel coupling schemes along with different alternatives of ORC and absorption cooling machines. The study was conducted considering a temperature range of low-to-medium geothermal resource from 80 degrees C to 150 degrees C. Mathematical models are developed based on first and second law of thermodynamics and solved by means of an equation solver. The results show a threshold temperature that makes a shift between feasible polygeneration arrangements and the type of thermally driven technologies adopted, resulting in two different polygeneration arrangements with highest energetic and exergetic performance. The first arrangement correspond to a temperature range that lies between 80 degrees C and 110 degrees C, and the second one between 110 degrees C and 150 degrees C. The poly generation arrangement with highest exergetic performance for the first range of temperatures was the hybrid parallel-series cascade arrangement (HPS2) having exergy efficiencies between 42.82% and 50.11%, while the one corresponding to the second temperature range was the series cascade arrangement (SC1) presenting exergy efficiencies from 51.44% to 52.9%. This effect is a consequence of the available temperature of the geothermal resource and the intrinsic energy performance of the different technologies considered. In regard to thermally driven technologies, arrangements where ORC and TDC subsystems are placed at the first thermal level, are the ones with the highest energetic and exergetic performance. Arrangements that have those components at the last level, present lowest performances.

AB The spiral type one is more prominent of which the vertical type ground heat exchange (GHE) is the most common in ground source heat pumps (GSHP) and on the purpose of this study as well. The present paper provides numerical simulation for 1D-3D model of the ground source heat pumps in cooling mode by using COMSOL environment. In contrary to popular spiral models, this model is designed with a low depth and high diameter with special metal rods (Fins). The simulated spiral pipe has 10 m in depth and 1 m in diameter. In order to compensate the reduction in heat transfer due to the lower depth, the effect of different parameters such as velocity, pitch, thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity in backfill material and ground on the heat performance is investigated. Furthermore, different velocity range is recommended for several pitches. Also, as a novelty, an innovative design is modeled consisting of diverse type of horizontal aluminum rods (Fins) in the soil connected to the pipe completely (Finned pipe). The fins not only hold the pipe inside the ground firmly but also improve the heat transfer rate due to the area increase and the high thermal conductivity system up to 31%.

ID OPTIMIZATION; PERFORMANCE; MODEL
AB An appropriate degree of mixing in molten salt tanks for Thermal Energy Storage (TES) in Concentrated Solar Power Plants (CSPPs) is required in order to ensure the safe operation of the tank. Otherwise, cooling due to thermal heat losses is prone to result in a high thermal stratification of the salts and eventually local solidification. In this work, the mixing performance of different configurations of ejectors is investigated by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). A set of different ejector configurations has been resolved, modifying the number of ejectors, flow direction, and ejector angle. The best configurations are identified, where the highest fluid circulation capacity is achieved by 10 ejectors directing the jet flow in the tangential direction with an inclination angle of 0 degrees with respect to the tank bottom surface. This is increasing the fluid circulation capacity of the tank by more than 100% with respect to the usual configuration implemented in such tanks (ejectors directed to the tank central vertical axis, at 30 degrees angle). In addition, such configuration ensures an enhanced flow circulation in the bottom part of the tank (with an increase of more than 6 times in the flow velocity in the lower section of the tank), reducing the risk of local salt solidification due to heat loss through the bottom surface. However, the shortest mixing times (95% and 99%) are achieved by the configuration with 10 ejectors pumping flow towards the central tank axis with an inclination angle of 0 degrees.

AB This paper integrates solar energy, regarded as the most abundant renewable energy in the world, into oil and gas industries to produce the hydrogen required in crude oil upgrader processes. Three alternatives of producing hydrogen from solar energy were proposed, namely, Solar Steam Methane Reforming using a Volumetric Receiver Reactor (SSMR-VRR), Solar Steam Methane Reforming using Molten Salt (SSMR-MS), and Solar Thermal Power generation coupled with Water Electrolysis (STP-WE). Simulations of all alternatives have been done to produce 2577 kmol per hour hydrogen: that is, the demand in the crude oil upgrader process. The technical, economic, and environmental analysis is performed to compare the results of the alternatives with the conventional steam reforming of natural gas. The results suggest that SSMR-VRR has the lowest levelized cost of hydrogen production, which is $2.5 per kg of hydrogen; SSMR-MS has a highest energy efficiency of 68%, and STP-WE has the lowest greenhouse gas emissions. The economic analysis suggests that currently the thermo-chemical processes (SSMR-VRR and SSMR-MS) have potential for producing hydrogen required by the crude oil upgrader; however, as the renewable energy technologies progress that may lead to their capital cost decrease, solar thermal power with water electrolysis (STP-WE) will become a more promising sustainable option for hydrogen production.

AB To overcome the water shortage problem, sea water desalination is a prospective answer in order to cater for the escalating demand for fresh water. Freeze desalination is where the freezing of sea water permits the separation of salts from the water in order to produce potable water. The ice formed is of pure water as the ice crystal lattice prevents the inclusion of any salts. The lower energy usage of freeze desalination in comparison to other desalination processes is the key advantage; as the latent heat of fusion (333.5 kJ/kg) is about 1/7th that of the latent heat of vaporisation (2256.7 kJ/kg). CFD ANSYS fluent software has been used to simulate the freeze desalination process; results were compared with experimental tests showing a maximum deviation of 0.93% for the temperature change during the ice forming process and the percentage errors obtained for the salinities of ice and brine were 15% and 10.5% respectively. From parametric analysis study, results showed that, as the freezing temperature reduces, the volume of the generated ice block increases, where at 225 K freeze temperature, 5 times more ice was produced compared to that at 257.15 K, but with a high salinity level of 3.02%. Results also showed that the lowest average salinity achieved was 0.5% at an ice layer thickness of around 4 mm using a freezing temperature of 245 K. This is higher than the 0.1% salinity level recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) standards as safe to drink water. Therefore, a second stage freezing process was applied to this 0.5% saline water to produce the required salinity level. Results showed that the achieved average ice salinity in the second stage of freezing process was below 0.05% which is regarded as good quality drinking water; also freezing at 225 K temperature produced the largest pure ice volume. These results highlight the potential of using freeze desalination to produce drinking water.

AB In this work, a hybrid system composed of a compressed air energy storage, a micro gas turbine, an organic Rankine cycle, a solar dish collector, and a multi effect distillation is presented as a combined power, heat, and fresh water production system. Energy and exergy analyses are applied to investigate thermodynamic performance of the system. The results show that the system consumes 278 kWh electricity and produces about 3.7 ton hot water during charging mode. Also, the system is capable of generating up to 523 kWh electrical energy and 2.5 ton potable water during the discharge period. The charge and the discharge period are 6.52 and 4 h respectively. Exergy analyses reveals that solar dish collector and combustion chamber are the major contributors for exergy destruction. Parametric analysis is employed to investigate the key parameters which have the major influence on the system performance. These parameters include cavern minimum and maximum pressures, gas turbine inlet temperature, dish collector aperture diameter, steam turbine inlet pressure, and desalinator feed water temperature. Optimization results show that round trip efficiency can rise from 65.2% to 70.35%, using upper limits of cavern minimum and maximum pressures. Besides, rising inlet temperature of gas turbine and restricting air cavern maximum and minimum pressures to their lower limits results in a 19.18% exergy efficiency improvement. Finally, economic analysis is performed to evaluate main cost and income sources of the system. As multi objective optimization shows, devising conditions that lead to produce more electrical energy improves system economic performance considerably.

AB Wind energy is one of the emerging sustainable sources of electricity. Wind is intermittent in nature. The typical grid operation of wind energy is complex. The significance of wind energy generation and integration with the grid is increasing day by day. An accurate wind speed forecasting method will help the utility planners and operators to meet the balance of supply and demand by generating wind energy. In this paper, a statistical-based wind speed prediction is implemented without utilizing the numerical weather prediction inputs. This analytical study proposes a hybrid short-term prediction approach that can successfully preprocess the original wind speed data to enhance the forecasting accuracy. The most efficient signal decomposition algorithm, Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition is used for preprocessing. This ensemble empirical mode decomposition technique decomposes the original wind speed data. Each decomposed signal is regressed to forecast the future wind speed value by utilizing the Adaptive Wavelet Neural Network model. The proposed hybrid approach is subsequently investigated with respect to the wind farm of South India. The results from a real-world case study in India are reported along with comprehensive comparison. The prediction performance delivered high accuracy, less uncertainty and low computational burden in the forecasts attained. The developed hybrid model outperforms the six other benchmark models such as persistence method, back propagation neural network, radial basis function neural network, Elman neural network, Gaussian regression neural network, and wavelet neural network.

AB The continuous biodiesel production from soybean oil was carried out under the subcritical condition of methanol with MnCO3/Na-silicate as a heterogeneous catalyst. The transesterification rate was first investigated in a set of experiments performed in a batch autoclave at 448 K using methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 18:1 and various catalyst loadings (5, 10 and 20 wt% based on the oil mass). The results from these experiments, as well as the experimental data and the appropriate kinetic model recently reported in the literature were used for designing a packed bed tubular reactor (PBTR), a main unit of the pilot plant with the capacity of 100 L of biodiesel per day. The pilot plant was constructed and tested under various operating conditions. The first 11 h of the pilot-plant operation was realized in the tubular reactor packed with inert glass beads (i.e. without the catalyst) in order to analyze the effect of the non-catalyzed subcritical biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters, FAME) production. Then, glass beads were replaced with a mix of MnCO3/Na-silicate catalyst particles and glass beads, and the catalytic biodiesel production was continuously run under the subcritical methanol condition for 85 h. Two mass balance tests during the continuous pilot plant operation were performed.

AB Very accurate second-order thermal models have been developed for the thermal simulation of Stirling engines in recent years. One of the last ones is the comprehensive polytropic model of Stirling engine called the CPMS model. The accuracy of the CPMS model was found to be sufficient for the nominal operation of a prototype Stirling engine known as the GPU-3 engine. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the CPMS model was drastically reduced at high rotational speeds of the engine. In this paper, power loss and pressure change due to the inertial force of the crank system were integrated into the CPMS thermal model in order to compensate inaccuracy of the CPMS model at high rotational speeds. Moreover, the effect of rotational speed on the gas temperature in heater and cooler was also incorporated. A precise model for evaluating the mechanical friction loss was also employed and compared with the simple frictional model of the simple frictional model used in the CPMS. The model was examined on the GPU-3 engine, and it was found that it has superior accuracy compared to the previous thermal model over the entire working regime of the GPU-3 engine.

AB This case study presents the energy, emissions, and operating cost advantages and consequences of microgrid implementation. The buildings system considered in this study consists of commercial and residential components and exhibits complementary building use behavior between these two building types. This study investigates the advantages provided to the overall system by operating the buildings as a cluster in a microgrid as compared to standalone operation for each building unit. Variety of distributed electricity generation technologies were implemented and modelled to evaluate the behaviors of photovoltaic generation and seasonal micro co-generation of heat and power in each operational configuration. The results show that the buildings system was able to manage its distributed electricity generation and storage resources to meet the total system demand as a microgrid. This was achieved through the sharing of local energy generation and storage resources, which provided improved load-balancing and more efficient utilization of storage capacities within the buildings system. From the energy assessment, implementation of the microgrid configuration resulted in a reduction in total required storage capacity of up to 6.7% while also reducing consumption of grid electricity by up to 13.8%, as compared to standalone operation. Meanwhile, the emissions and operating costs assessments showed that, under scenarios with a high level of photovoltaic generation potential and seasonal micro-cogeneration of heat and power operation, a microgrid configuration reduces annual emission and operating costs by up to 1.29% and 61.2%, respectively.

AB A modified form of hybrid method for advanced exergy analysis is introduced and applied to an anode gas recirculation solid oxide fuel cell system. The results are compared with the corresponding values achieved from applying the well-known engineering method of advanced exergy analysis to the system. The modified hybrid method proved to be accurate and less time consuming and also, in contrast with the hybrid method introduced in literature, doesn't require the violation of the conservation of mass or exergy balance. In addition the modified hybrid method is more appropriate for parametric studies and optimization of energy conversion systems. The results obtained from both the advanced exergy methods are found to agree with one another and differ from those obtained from conventional exergy analysis. The values of endogenous and unavoidable endogenous exergy destruction rates for modified hybrid method are approximately 4% higher than the corresponding values obtained by the engineering method. The unavoidable conditions required for the analyses in both methods are obtained by a micro-structure analysis showing that the energy and exergy efficiencies of the system, under unavoidable conditions can be higher by up to 26%, 24.8%, respectively, compared to the corresponding values under the real conditions.
   As the highest avoidable endogenous exergy destruction rates occur in the inverter, 6.6 kW, and the stack, 3.7 kW, more attention should be paid to these components when the system performance is to be optimized. A different order, however, is achieved by applying the conventional exergy analysis.

AB The present paper deals with the thermoeconomic analysis of a CO2 compression system using waste heat into the regenerative organic Rankine cycle. The compressor power required for CO2 compression in the Carbon Capture and Storage has been supplied from a regenerative organic Rankine cycle which is used in thermal power plant. By using the turbine power supplied from the heat drawn and waste flue gas and the intercooler heat exchangers, 8% of the CO2 separated from the waste flue gas compressed in the gas compressor. Thermoeconomic analysis of the system is performed by calculating thermodynamic and economic properties of the system. Energy and exergy efficiencies of cycle have been calculated as 17.2% and 51.6%. The average exergetic cost of waste heat flue gas as a fuel input in the integrated to the system is calculated to be 12.34 $/GJ or 947.5 $/h. The unit exergetic cost of electricity from the ORC system is calculated to be 17.47 $/GJ or 0.063 $AcWh. The unit exergetic cost of compressed CO2 gas is calculated to be 84.9 $/GJ or 184.3 $/h at 310 K and 15,244 kPa. The cost of compressed CO2 in the plant is calculated to be 18.36 $ per tonne of CO2. The total exergy destruction cost rate of the plant and the most destructive component of the flue gas heat exchanger is calculated to be 297.8 $/h and 219.1 $/h, respectively.

AB A pilot scale pressurized (50 psi) fluidized bed gasification was performed to investigate the effects of the jet/grid air ratio (5:95-90:10) and equivalence ratio (ER = 0.23-0.45) on the gasification products such as syngas, tar, contaminant gas, and biochar. There was a noticeable effect of the jet/grid ratios on the syngas concentration. An increase in CO, CH4, and C-2 gases was obtained at the condition closer to jet/grid = 50:50, whereas a higher jet/grid ratio favored water gas shift reaction by increasing CO2 and H-2 gases under the pressurized condition. The highest lower heating value (LHV) of 7.7 MJ/Nm(3) was obtained at the lowest ER = 0.23. Both the jet/grid ratio and ER were important parameters in determining the H-2 concentration. The cold gasification and carbon conversion efficiencies were obtained as high as 66% and 94%, respectively. Also, higher temperature and ER promoted a reduction in contaminant gases as well as tar yield. Tar product yield was also reduced significantly after a wet scrubber, and the tar consisted of chemicals of a carbon number less than 13 (<= C-12). The gasification biochar was also analyzed and showed an effective carbon sequestration property with a relatively higher surface area (105 m(2)/g). Furthermore, computational fluid dynamics simulation was performed to determine the effects of different jet/grid air ratio and pressure conditions on the hydrodynamics in the fluidized bed reactor.

AB A validated MATLAB code is developed to design a dry cooling unit for a 25 MW solar power plant operated with supercritical CO2 (sCO(2)) Brayton cycle. Both direct and indirect cooling systems are designed for the power plant and their performance are compared. For direct cooling system, air cooled heat exchanger unit is designed whereas for indirect cooling system, optimum size of shell and tube heat exchanger is selected addressing the retainment of shell side heat transfer correction factor within a reasonable limit. The nonlinear property variation of sCO(2) near the critical condition is reasonably well captured by the present code in both shell and tube and air cooled heat exchanger units. The comparative study of direct and indirect cooling system is performed for inlet sCO(2) temperature of 71 degrees C, operating pressure of 7.5 MPa and ambient air temperature from 15 degrees C to 40 degrees C. For the same heat rejection, indirect cooling system requires a much higher cooling tower. During high ambient temperature period, direct dry cooling system shows superior cooling performance in terms of lower sCO(2) outlet temperature compared to indirect cooling system.

AB The free-piston diesel engine linear generator (FPDLG) shows a great deal of merits due to its unique structure and operation characteristics. For this reason, most researchers mainly investigated on the FPDLG characteristics. However, there has not been any report on the engine operation characteristics. So this paper focuses on the engine operation characteristics of the FPDLG during the generating process. According to the experimental results, it is found that the output power of the designed prototype can reach 5.16 kW with the thermal efficiency of up to 38.5%. Experimental test results are obtained and processed both in time and crank-angle coordinates. Compared to the conventional diesel engines, the ignition delay of the FPDLG is shorter and the premix combustion quality is better. By analyzing the operating cyclical variations of the prototype, the coefficient of variation (COV) of the compression ratio is found to be higher than 27%. While the peak in-cylinder gas pressure and pressure rising ratio cyclical variation can maintain a stable operation (similar to the conventional diesel engines), higher COVs of the compression ratio can always complicates the engine combustion. Therefore proper control strategies are necessary for the FPDLG.

AB This paper proposes a new strategy for implementing the Reconfigurable Solar Photovoltaic array or Dynamic Photovoltaic array under repeating shade conditions. The repeating shades are mainly caused by the civil structures, buildings, poles, etc., present in the vicinity of a Dynamic Photovoltaic array. This paper presents a new algorithm to minimize the processing time in case of repeating shades. According to which, the controller does not have to perform the exhaustive calculations at each shade condition. Instead, the algorithm compares the present shade response with the previous shade responses. Simulation of 4-by-4 size Dynamic Photovoltaic array has been carried out. Experimental tests of a Dynamic Photovoltaic array under resistive load conditions have been conducted. A switch-network of double pole double throw switches has been proposed and is used in the Dynamic Photovoltaic array experimental test. Switch-count of the proposed switch-network is one-third and significantly less compared to the conventional semiconductor switch-network.

AB Atherosclerosis is a vascular disease associated with ageing, and its occurrence and development are closely related to the vascular inflammatory response. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) has distinct effects in atherosclerosis. We aimed to determine the mechanisms underlying these effects. microRNAs including miR-758 were differentially expressed in oxLDL-treated HUVECs or HAECs. Luciferase reporter assay results indicated that SUCNR1 is an important target of miR-758. Expression of SUCNR1 and its downstream components was decreased significantly in ApoE-/- mice. Overexpression of miR-758 could suppress HUVEC proliferation by cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. miR-758 was overexpressed on HUVECs with markedly reduced capillary tubule formation capacity. Overexpression of miR-758 on HUVECs or HAECs could significantly reduce SUCNR1 (GPR91), SATA3, phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3), and EVGF levels. Thus, oxLDL likely damages vascular endothelial cells by modulating the DLK1-DIO3 genomic imprinted microRNA cluster component miR-758, thereby suppressing expression of SUCNR1/GPR91 and its downstream components.

AB Therapeutic effects of anti-cancer drugs for ovarian cancer were limited due to the rapid development of chemotherapy resistance. The aim of this study was to test whether knockdown of Homeobox B4 (HOXB4) enhanced the cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel and cisplatin in ovarian cancer cells. HOXB4 expressions at mRNA and protein levels were upregulated in Taxol-resistant A2780 (A2780/Taxol) and DDP-resistant SKOV-3 (SKOV-3/DDP) cells. HOXB4 knockdown enhanced the cytotoxic effects of Taxol and DDP in A2780/Taxol and SKOV-3/DDP cells, respectively. HOXB4 silencing suppressed the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway and reduced the expression of ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2 in ovarian cancer cells. PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or siRNA targeting Akt (si-Akt) treatment inhibited cell viability, decreased protein levels of ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2, and increased LDH release in A2780/Taxol and SKOV-3/DDP cells. These findings revealed that HOXB4 knockdown enhanced the cytotoxic effects of Taxol and DDP by downregulating ABC transporters via inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway in ovarian cancer cells.

AB Aims: The present study was aimed to evaluate the association of C2850T, G1846A and C100T polymorphisms of the CYP2D6 with coronary artery disease (CAD) in North-West Indian population.
   Methods: In this case-control study, 200 patients with CAD and 200 age-, gender- and ethnicity-matched healthy controls were genotyped for C2850T, G1846A and C100T polymorphisms of CYP2D6 using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.
   Results: Genotype and allele distributions of C2850T and G1846A polymorphisms of the CYP2D6 were significantly different between cases and controls (p = 0.038, p = 0.021; p = 0.048, p = 0.012, respectively) whereas the distribution of genotype and allele for C100T polymorphism did not differ significantly (p = 0.098, p = 0.117, respectively). The 2850T and1846A variants were significantly associated with the increased risk of developing CAD, as observed from the odds ratios for the 2850 T/T and 1846 G/A genotypes (OR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.99-4.99, p = 0.015 and OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.02-2.56, p = 0.041, respectively). Moreover, the recessive model in C2850T and the dominant model in G1846A are the best fit inheritance models to predict the susceptible gene effects (OR: 2. 07, 95% CI: 1.05-4.08, p = 0.031 and OR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.10-2.62, p = 0.016, respectively). On gender stratification, these associations were observed only in females in addition to the C/T genotype of C2850T (OR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.42-4.38, p = 0.001) and C100T (OR: 3.18, 95% CI: 1.52-6.67, p = 0.002). Furthermore, it is also observed that the CAT (OR: 2. 61, 95% CI: 1.07-6.34, p = 0.035) and TAC (OR: 15. 22, 95% CI: 1.97-117.58, p = 0.009) are high-risk haplotypes for CAD in the total group, whereas, the TGC (OR: 1. 64, 95% CI: 1.02-2.62, p = 0.042) and CAT (OR: 4. 21, 95% CI: 1.12-15.59, p = 0.035) haplotypes provide gender-specific risk in females.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate significant association of C2850T, G1846A and C100T polymorphisms of CYP2D6 with CAD especially in females of North-West Indian population.

AB Folate metabolism pathway is mainly associated with syntheses of nucleic acids and proteins as well as DNA methylation and repair. Cytoplasmic C-1 tetrahydrofolate (C-1-THF) synthase is a central enzyme in folate metabolism and plays an important role in conversion. The full-length sequence of silkworm (Bombyx mori) cytoplasmic C-1-THF synthase (BmC(1)-THF synthase) gene including an open reading frame (ORF) of 932 amino acid residues was cloned. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that BmC(1)-THF synthase shares 84% and 81% identity with C-1-THF synthase of Papilio Xuthus and Danaus plexippus, respectively. Conserved sequence analysis showed that the 330 to 710 amino acid residues of BmC(1)-THF synthase were highly conserved among various organisms. Recombinant BmC(1)-THF synthase protein with a molecular weight of about 105.5 kDa was expressed in E. coli cells and identified using SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis. The expression of BmC(1)-THF synthase gene in eight silkworm tissues revealed that BmC(1)-THF synthase gene is widely expressed in various tissues of silkworm and highly expressed in the fat body. The expression characteristics of BmC(1)-THF synthase gene in response to oxidative stress were conducted under phoxim and high temperature (30 degrees C) exposure. The results showed that the transcriptional level of BmC(1)-THF synthase gene was upregulated by 3.435-fold and 6.845-fold after phoxim and high temperature (30 degrees C) exposure, respectively, indicating that BmC(1)-THF synthase gene may play a significant role in response of silkworm to oxidative stresses.

AB Nanos gene plays an important role in germline development in animals. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in germline development in Mollusca, the second largest animal phylum, are still poorly understood. Here we identified the Nanos orthologue from the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas (Cg-Nanos-like), and investigated the expression patterns of Nanos during gametogenesis and embryogenesis in C. gigas. Tissue expression analysis showed that Cg-Nanos-like was specifically expressed in female gonads. During the reproductive cycle, the expression of Cg-Nanos-like mRNA increased matching the seasonal development of the ovarian tissues in diploids, while the expression levels were significantly lower in the ovaries of sterile triploids compared to diploids. High expression of Cg-Nanos-like transcripts were detected in early embryonic stages, while the expression significantly dropped at gastrulation and was barely detectable in veliger stages. In situ hybridization showed that Cg-Nanos-like was expressed at different stages of developing oocytes, whereas positive signals were detected only in spermatogonia during the spermatogenic cycle. These findings indicated that Cg-Nanos-like was involved in the development of germ cells, and maintenance of oocyte maturation. In early embryogenesis, the transcripts were broadly expressed; following gastrulation, the expression was restricted to two cell clumps, which might be the putative primordial germ cells (PGCs) or their precursors. Based on the results, the formation of the PGCs in C. gigas was consistent with the model of transition from epigenesis to preformation.

AB We have previously reported a heterogeneous expression pattern of the nuclear membrane protein lamin A/C in low- and high-Gleason score (GS) prostate cancer (PC) tissues, and we have now found that this change is not associated with LMNA mutations. This expression pattern appears to be similar to the process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) or to that of mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). The role of lamin A/C in EMT or MET in PC remains unclear. Therefore, we first investigated the expression levels of and the associations between lamin A/C and several common EMT markers, such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin, beta-catenin, snail, slug and vimentin in PC tissues with different GS values and in different cell lines with varying invasion abilities. Our results suggest that lamin A/C might constitute a type of epithelial marker that better signifies EMT and MET in PC tissue, since a decrease in lamin A/C expression in GS 4 + 5 cases is likely associated with the EMT process, while the re-expression of lamin A/C in GS 5 + 4 cases is likely linked with MET. The detailed GS better exhibited the changes in lamin A/C and the EMT markers examined. Lamin A/C overexpression or knockdown had an impact on EMT biomarkers in a cell model by direct regulation of P-catenin. Hence, we suggest that lamin A/C might serve as a reliable epithelial biomarker for the distinction of PC cell differentiation and might also be a fundamental factor in the occurrence of EMT or MET in PC.

AB Orf virus (ORFV), a member of the genus Parapoxvirus in the family Poxviridae, is the cause of orf, a highly contagious zoonotic viral disease that affects mainly sheep and goats. In the present study, the sequence and phylogenetic analysis of Indian ORFV isolates (n = 15) from natural outbreaks in sheep and goats belonging to different geographical regions were analysed on the basis of F1L gene along with homology modelling of F1L protein. Multiple sequence alignments revealed highly conserved C-terminus and heterogeneity of N-terminus region of F1L among all orf viruses studied. Further, a comparative sequence alignment indicated conservation of various motifs such as glycosaminoglycan (GAG), Asp/Glu any residue Asp (D/ExD) and a Cx3C chemokine like motif among all poxviruses and unique motifs (proline rich region [PRR] and Lys-Gly-Asp [KGD]), in parapoxviruses including ORFV isolates irrespective of geography and host species. Phylogenetically, two major clusters were noticed which included Indian orf isolates along with foreign isolates. Structurally, ORFV F1L resembled the topology as exhibited by its homologue vaccinia virus H3 protein with mixed beta/alpha folds and ligand binding specificity in docking models. We noted that despite differences in host cell specificity and pathogencity, poxvirus proteins especially ORFV F1L protein and its homologues presumed to share similarities as they are highly conserved irrespective of species and countries of origin. Further, the study also indicated the possibilities of differentiation of ORFV strains based on N-terminal heterogeneity despite highly conserved C-terminal region with conserved motifs.

AB Glycolysis, through anaerobic respiration, can supply energy for human sperm motility. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) could participate in the glycolytic pathway through regulating target genes. To investigate the potential role of glycolysis-related miRNAs in asthenozoospermia, TaqMan Low Density Array (TLDA) was used to screen potentially functional miRNAs, and seven glycolysis-related miRNAs were isolated to be related to asthenozoospermia. After qRT-PCR validation, only one seminal plasma miRNA, let-7b-5p, was found significantly decreased in severe asthenozoospermia cases compared with healthy controls. To further understand whether let-7b-5p is involved in asthenozoospermia by regulating the glycolytic pathway, we carried out gain-and-loss function study of let-7b-5p in GC-2 cells and detected the glycolytic activities. Our results showed that knocking down let-7b-5p could inhibit glycolytic activities. Besides, we also found overexpressed Aurkb (a target gene of let-7b-5p) could recapitulate the effects of knocking down let-7b-5p. Our findings indicated that low expression of let-7b-5p could repress glycolysis in asthenozoospermia by targeting AURKB.

DE Exon junction complex; Intervening sequence; Ciliate
ID EXON JUNCTION COMPLEX; NONSENSE-MEDIATED DECAY; DEAD-BOX PROTEIN;

AB The exon junction complex (EJC) is a key element of the splicing machinery. The EJC core is composed of eIF4A3, MAGO, Y14 and MLN51. Few accessory proteins, such as CWC22 or UPF3, bind transiently to the EJC. The EJC has been implicated in the control of the splicing of long introns. To ascertain whether the EJC controls the splicing of short introns, we used Paramecium tetraurelia as a model organism, since it has thousands of very tiny introns. To elucidate whether EJC affects intron splicing in P. tetraurelia, we searched for EJC protein-coding genes, and silenced those genes coding for eIF4A3, MAGO and CWC22. We found that P. tetraurelia likely assembles an active EJC with only three of the core proteins, since MLN51 is lacking. Silencing of eIF4A3 or CWC22 genes, but not that of MAGO, caused lethality. Silencing of the MAGO gene caused either an increase, decrease, or no change in intron retention levels of some intron-containing mRNAs used as reporters. We suggest that a fine-tuning expression of EJC genes is required for steady intron removal in P. tetraurelia. Taking into consideration our results and those published by others, we conclude that the EJC controls splicing independently of the intron size.

AB Patients with Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS), a syndromic growth retardation syndrome, usually harbor an epimutation at chromosome 11p15 or a maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7. However, to date the genetic cause remains unknown in around 40% of SRS cases, suggesting genetic heterogeneity and involvement of other genes.
   We present a 4-year-old female patient with the clinical diagnosis of SRS and negative results in common genetic SRS diagnostics. Whole exome sequencing identified a de novo heterozygous 7.3 kb deletion on chromosome 12q14.3 including exon 1 and 2 of HMGA2.
   HMGA2 encodes an architectural transcription factor and has already been linked to body size variations in various genome-wide association studies and mouse models. Reviewing the literature, we found additional four patients with a phenotype of SRS harboring point mutations or structural variants involving HMGA2. We conclude that genetic testing of HMGA2 should be considered in routine diagnostics in patients with the suspicion of SRS.

AB Congenital bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), the most common form of birth defect in humans, is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Increasing evidence demonstrates that genetic risk factors play a key role in the pathogenesis of BAV. However, BAV is a genetically heterogeneous disease and the genetic determinants underpinning BAV in an overwhelming majority of patients remain unknown. In the present study, the coding exons and flanking introns of the GATA6 gene, which encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor essential for the normal development of the aortic valves, were sequenced in 152 unrelated patients with congenital BAV. The available relatives of a proband harboring an identified GATA6 mutation and 200 unrelated, ethnically matched healthy individuals used as controls were also genotyped for GATA6. The functional characteristics of the mutation were analyzed by using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system. As a result, a novel heterozygous GATA6 mutation, p.E386X, was identified in a family with BAV transmitted in an autosomal dominant mode. The nonsense mutation was absent in 400 control chromosomes. Biological assays revealed that the mutant GATA6 protein had no transcriptional activity compared with its wild-type counterpart. Furthermore, the mutation disrupted the synergistic transcriptional activation between GATA6 and GATA4, another transcription factor causally linked to BAV. In conclusion, this study firstly associates GATA6 loss-of-function mutation with enhanced susceptibility to familial BAV, which provides novel insight into the molecular mechanism of BAV, implying potential implications for genetic counseling and personalized management of BAV patients.

   Methods: This study enrolled 196 patients undergoing liver transplantation for HBV related end-stage liver diseases. We detected 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of 7 one-carbon metabolism pathway genes (including MTHFR, MTR, MTRR, ALDH1L1, GART, SHMT1 and CBS) in donor livers and analyzed their association with HBV reinfection after liver transplantation.
   Results: Hepatitis B recurrence was observed in 19 of the 196 patients (9.7%) undergoing liver transplantation. Hepatitis B recurrence significantly affected post-transplant survival in the 196 patients (p = 0.018), and correlate with tumor recurrence in the subgroup of HCC patients (n = 99, p = 0.006). Among the 11 SNPs, donor liver mutation in rs1979277 (G > A) was adversely associated with post-transplant hepatitis B recurrence (p = 0.042). In the subgroup of HCC patients, survival analysis showed donor liver mutations in rs1801133 (G > A) and rs1979277 (G > A) were risk factors for hepatitis B recurrence (p < 0.05). None of the 11 SNPs was related to hepatitis B recurrence in non-HCC patients (n = 97, p > 0.05).
   Conclusion: Hepatitis B recurrence impaired post-transplant survival. Donor liver genetic variations in one carbon metabolism pathway genes were significantly associated with post-transplant hepatitis B recurrence.

AB Complex balanced autosomal translocation is rare and can lead to impaired spermatogenesis in males; however, its effects on oligozoospermia have rarely been reported. We report here two cases of rare complex balanced translocation in men with infertility. The karyotype of the first case was 46,XY,der(1)t(1;12)(p22;p11.2)ins(9;1) (p24;g25g23),der(9)ins(9;1),der(12)t(1;12).ish der(1)t(1;12)(RP11-63631 +;RP11-659D23 +)ins(9;1)(RP11118P13 +),der(9)ins(9;1),der(12)t(1;12). And the patient showed severe oligozoospermia with adult schizophrenia without other abnormalities. The karyotype of the second patient was 46,XY,der(5)t(5;11) (q14;p11.2),der(11)011;18)(p11.2;q11.2),der(18)t(5,18)(q14;p11.3)add(18)(q11.2?).ish der(5)t(5;11)(RP11846K3 +,RP11-89B9 +),der(11)t(11;18)(RP11-8989-,RP11-170L12 +,RP11-469N6 +),der(18)t(5;18)(RP11125L2 +,RP11-29M13 +)add(18)(q11.2?), and the patient displayed severe oligozoospermia without other abnormalities. The two cases were verified by fluorescent in situ hybridization, and no abnormalities were found by genome-wide copy number variation analysis. To our knowledge, these two cases of complex autosomal karyotypes have not been reported previously. Although rare, these cases suggest that complex balanced translocations may be important causes of oligozoospermia. We speculate that the balanced translocation hinders germ cell meiosis and causes impaired spermatogenesis. Accordingly, the two reported patients have very low probabilities of giving birth to a normal child; therefore, we suggest choosing donor semen or adopting a child.

AB Pesticides have been used extensively for pest control, resulting in serious pesticide resistance. It is extremely valuable to identify the resistance genes related to pest control. In our previous studies, we reported that Ran is the deltamethrin (DM) resistance-associated gene. To clarify whether Ran is also related to the resistance of other pesticides, we selected four kinds of pesticides, including parathion, DDT, carbaryl and pleocidin, for further study. The results showed that Ran could be up-regulated by all pesticides. We further verified the relationship between Ran and resistance to the 4 pesticides by Ran RNAi, Ran overexpression and cell apoptosis. We found that the dsRNA of Ran induced more cell apoptosis than the control. Ran overexpression can significantly improve cell tolerance to various pesticides. These results demonstrate that Ran is associated with the resistance to and tolerance of multiple pesticides. Our evidence suggests the Ran is a potential molecular target gene of resistance control.

AB The analysis of protein similarity is a matter of concern in the bioinformatics field, since studying the protein similarity can help understand the protein structure-function relationship. To this aim, several methods have been proposed, but currently, protein similarity results are still not satisfactory. Here we presented a novel method for evaluating the similarity of 3D protein models based on hybrid features, including the local diameter (LD), the salient geometric feature (SGF) and the heat kernel signature (HKS). LD is suitable to the topological deformation of 3D models, SGF is an important local feature on the protein model surface, and HKS is invariant under isometric deformations. Our method provides the improved feature extraction procedure to calculate LD, SGF and HKS of a protein model, and then uses these features to construct a tensor based feature descriptor for 3D protein models. The method finally analyzes the similarity of 3D protein models by using this tensor descriptor and the extended grey relation analysis. Experimental data indicated that our method is effective and can outperform the existing similarity analysis results obtained by previously reported methods.

AB Dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) plays critical roles in a variety of biological processes. Recent studies have documented that lncRNAs can function as potential biomarkers in cancer prognosis, however, little is known in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To identify lncRNA signatures that have prognostic values in HCC, we analyzed lncRNA expression profiles of 364 HCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. A set of four lncRNAs was identified to be significantly associated with the overall survival. Based on the four-IncRNA signature, HCC patients can be classified into high-and low-risk subgroups with significantly different survival. This result can be further validated in the testing set and another independent HCC data. Further analyses showed that the prognostic value of four-IncRNA signature was independent of other dinicopathological factors. The potential functions of candidate lncRNAs were further examined using HCC cell lines, suggesting these lncRNAs might contribute to tumor development of HCC. This work indicated that lncRNA signature could be a useful marker to determine the diagnosis and predict the prognosis of HCC.

AB In the case of diabetes and other complex diseases, the challenge has always been to find genetic markers that explain the excess risk associated with development of the disease. In the last 12 years, advances in genotyping technology provided substantial development in the discovery of loci contributing to Type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility. Therefore, the aim of this study is to custom design, for the first time in Arab world, an "Arab Diabetes Gene Centric Array" (ADGCA) that assays 643, 745 SNP markers including 50,617 diabetes associated SNPs. The array content was designed after comprehensive literature search prioritizing Diabetes associated SNPs. PCA was performed to evaluate the relationship between world populations and the Saudi population in building the backbone for the array. A genotype data matrix for PCA analysis was produced by including the genotypes of the 270 HapMap samples including JPT, CHB, YRI and CEU to genotypes of the 1457 Saudi samples. Imputation was executed using IMPUTE2 software and the 1000GP Phase III reference panel. All markers incorporated to ADGCA were validated. Quality checks and evaluation of its capacity and performance as a platform for genetic screening for T2D was performed using the latest stastical tools available. We were successful in designing ADGCA as a custom made chip array designed with a motive to capture genetic variation in loci known or reported to be associated with the development of T2D. However, implementation of ADGCA is currently being performed by our research group using 2000 DNA samples respectively from diabetic and non diabetic individuals which could further validate the use of ADGSA in genetic screening of T2D.

AB The copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD) could effectively eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, the cDNA sequence of Cu/Zn SOD from Corbicula fluminea (designated as CfCu/Zn SOD) was cloned by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) approaches. The full-length cDNA of CfCu/Zn SOD was of 1288 bp, including a 465 bp ORF encoding a protein of 154 amino acids. Two SOD family signatures were identified in CfCu/Zn SOD amino acids sequence. Multiple sequence alignments indicated that CfCu/Zn SOD amino acid sequences exhibited high similarities to those of other species. The tissue distribution of the CfCu/Zn SOD of C. fluminea was detected by fluorescent real-time quantitative PCR. The mRNA expression levels in digestive gland and gill were significantly higher than those of other four tissues. In response to metal ions (Cd2+, Cu2+, and Pb2+) challenge, the expression and enzymatic activities of CfCu/Zn SOD in the gills were measured after exposure for 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. The results showed that the mRNA expression and enzymatic activities of CfCu/Zn SOD could be induced by three metal ions. After Cd2+ and Cu2+ exposure, the mRNA expression levels increased gradually and reach the peak at 24 h, afterwards it slowed down. The change trends of enzymatic activities were similar to the mRNA expression. After Pb2+ exposure, the expression and activities CfCu/Zn SOD were raised up gradually and reach the highest value at 72 h. All these results indicated that the mRNA expression and enzymatic activity of CfCu/Zn SOD are sensitive to Cd2+, Cu2+ and Pb2+ ions and can be used as molecular biomarkers of metal pollution in water.

AB Objective: We explored the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs207454 and rs494852 located in xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) and gastric cancer (GC) survival.
   Methods: A total of 940 patients with gastric cancer were enrolled and genotyped using TaqMan allelic discrimination method. The Kaplan Meier test and log-rank examine were used to assess the effect of genetic variation.
   Results: Patients carrying rs207454 CC genotype had a longer survival time than those with the AA genotype (P = 0.042). The similar association was detected in the recessive model (P = 0.017). We conducted expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis and found that gastric cancer patients carrying rs207454 CC genotype had significant lower XDH levels than those with AA/AC genotype, suggesting that rs207454 polymorphism effected the expression of XDH. Additionally, the Kaplan-Meier curves showed that gastric cancer patients with high expression of XDH had remarkably poor survival outcome than those with low expression (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29-1.82).
   Conclusions: Genetic variants in XDH were associated with the survival of gastric cancer and may act as prognostic markers for individual suffered from gastric cancer.

AB The formation and mechanism of chromium and silicon enriched glass coating on carbon steel substrate were investigated in this paper, which was based on the protection properties of the glass coating to improve the anti-oxidation ability of carbon steel. The starting reaction temperature between the glass coating and steel substrate was 800 degrees C, which was approved by TG-DTA test. The diffusion of chromium and silicon element in glass coating was investigated at 800 degrees C and 1000 degrees C by WDS-EPMA and SEM-EDS. It indicated that chromium element began to migrate to interface between glass coating and carbon steel at 800 degrees C and a chromium enriched layer formed when the sample was heated at 800 degrees C for 60 min. Meanwhile, a silicon enriched layer started to form at the interface between glass coating and carbon steel at 1000 degrees C. The content of silicon element in the scale of coated sample increased with increasing heating time and which could reach up to 8.08% when the sample was heated at 1000 degrees C for 30 min. The sample was also characterized by XRD, SEM-EDS and Raman to investigate the possible phases formed during high temperature treatment.

AB Amorphous silicon (a-Si) models are analyzed for structural, electronic and vibrational characteristics. Several models of various sizes have been computationally fabricated for this analysis. It is shown that a recently developed structural modeling algorithm known as force-enhanced atomic refinement (FEAR) provides results in agreement with experimental neutron and X-ray diffraction data while producing a total energy below conventional schemes. We also show that a large model ( similar to 500 atoms) and a complete basis is necessary to properly describe vibrational and thermal properties. We compute the density for a-Si, and compare with experimental results.

AB Glasses of the compositions (100 - x)B2O3-(x / 2)Bi2O3-(x / 2)Fe2O3 with x = 50, 60 and 70 (in mol%) were prepared. The glassy phase of the samples was established by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Differential thermal analysis (DTA) studies. The formation of the BiFeO3 phase inside the glass matrix (glass-ceramic) by the heat treatment of the sample at x = 60 was identified by XRD, DTA and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) studies. FTIR results revealed that the glass samples are composed of BO3, BO4, BiO3, BiO6, FeO4 and FeO6 basic structural units. The trends of the glass transition temperature (T-g), density (rho), molar volume (V-m), oxygen packing fraction (OPD) and theoretical optical basicity (A(th)) were discussed in terms of the structural modifications that take place in the glass matrix. The variation of the dielectric constant (epsilon(r)), dielectric loss (tan delta) and the ac conductivity of the glass samples cannot be explained on the basis of the distance between iron ions (R-i) only but on the space charge polarization. The dielectric properties of the glass-ceramic were affected by the presence of BiFeO3 phase inside the glass matrix.

AB The quaternary glass system tellurium dioxide, boron trioxide, silicon dioxide and manganese dioxide where x = 0.00 to 0.05 M fraction has been successfully prepared via conventional melt and quench-casting technique. The density was determined by Archimedes method with distilled water as buoyant liquid. The results showed that the density decreases and molar volume increases with respect to manganese concentration. FTIR spectral studies suggest that glass network is mainly built up of boron trioxide, tetrahedral boron, tellurium trioxide, trioxotellurate and silicon dioxide structural units. The ultrasonic velocities and elastic moduli were recorded using a pulse-echo method at frequency 5 MHz at room temperature. Some other physical properties such as Debye temperature, softening temperature, microhardness, Poisson's ratio, fugacity, fractal bond connectivity and Cauchy relation were determined. Results indicate that these parameters depend upon the composition of the glass system and the dopant concentration, MnO2 inside the glass system.

AB Glasses with nominal molar compositions xZnO-(67-x)SnO-33P(2)O(5) were prepared and their structures were determined by P-31 MAS-NMR spectroscopy, HPLC, and by X-ray and neutron diffraction. Compositional dependent changes in the thermal and optical properties described in Part I of this study are attributed to changes in the coordination environments of Sn2+- and Zn2+-ions and their effects on the phosphate anionic network. The P-31 MAS-NMR and HPLC data reveal broader distributions of P-tetrahedra in glasses with greater ZnO-contents, due to disproportionation reactions of diphosphate anions in the glass melts to form isolated monophosphate anions and larger triphosphate anions, and due to the loss of some phosphate during glass preparation. The diffraction experiments reveal that Zn2+ prefers tetrahedral coordination, whereas Sn2+ is initially incorporated in isolated, three-coordinated sites that convert to four-coordinated sites with greater ZnO contents. These four-coordinated sites must share corners when incorporated into the glass structure and the transition from glasses dominated by isolated SnO3 pyramids to those with subnetworks of (Sn, Zn)O-4 polyhedra occurs near x = 20, and is reflected by breaks in the composition-property trends. The second break in properties occurs near x = 40, and reflects both the dominance of the ZnO4 units in the metal subnetwork, as well an increase in the relative numbers of monophosphate anions in the glass structure.

AB In this paper, we clarify the gel-to-glass (G-G) transformation behavior of the sol-gel derived xAl(2)O(3)-(100 - x) SiO2 (x = 0, 10, 20 and 30 mol) systems by differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, infrared (IR) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The SiO2-Al2O3 gels exhibit lower G-G transition temperature than the pure SiO2 reference gel. Adding Al2O3 to the SiO2 gel can suppress the dependence of glass transition temperature (T-g) on hydroxyl concentration, and this effect is attributed to the highly cross-linked structure in alumina-silica gels. In addition, the Al-rich phase separates from the Si-rich matrix phase, and such immiscibility increases with increasing Al2O3 content. This behavior is similar to that of the melt-quenched alumina-silica glasses.

AB The interfacial interaction between tin-fluoride-phosphate glass (TFP-glass) and polar polymers is enhanced with increasing temperature, however, the mechanism is still unclear. In this work, the evolution of the network structure in TFP-glass with increasing temperature is investigated to explore the plausible mechanism. The dissociation of the network structure in TFP-glass, which can be observed in all TFP-glass samples synthesized at different conditions, is believed to be the reason for the temperature-dependency of the interfacial interaction. The mechanism for the dissociation has been thoroughly investigated via two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D-IR), dynamic rheological analysis and XRD. The almost disappeared dissociation of TFP-glass extracted from Poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET)/TFP-glass composite validates our inference. The conclusion would help us to deeply understand the interfacial interaction in polar polymer/TFP-glass composites and ultimately provide a guideline for the preparation of polar polymer/TFP-glass composites with strong interfacial interaction.

AB We report on the lateral hardness of glasses from the Na2O-CaO-SiO2 (NCS) system, including CS and NS binaries. Quantitative data are provided on the work of lateral deformation, obtained through instrumented indentation by monitoring the lateral force as a function of normal load. Experiments were conducted in the regime of elastic-plastic deformation, that is, in the absence of microscopic cracking for normal loads of 50-70 mN. The scratch hardness is determined from the work of deformation per deformed volume. Parallel observations of the elastic properties are undertaken so as to reference scratching data to glass composition and structure. We find that structural densification and high rigidity favor higher scratch hardness. For the considered range of chemical compositions, the scratch hardness exhibits an approximately linear correlation with bulk modulus and packing density. It increases in the direction of compositions with higher content of CaO, and decreases with the content of Na2O. Furthermore, we find a strongly linear correlation between scratch hardness and the deviation of experimental compressibility from the mean-field estimate of the Makishima-Mackenzie model. This points to the importance of intermediate-range structural heterogeneity in the scratching process.

AB Structural changes of glassy B2O3, compacted under GPa pressures at temperatures below the glass transition, have been monitored by Raman spectroscopy, disclosing a progressively decreasing intensity of both the Boson peak and the main band at 808 cm(-1) with increasing densification. Both these components are determined by vibrational activity of boroxol rings (B3O6), the glassy super-structural units formed by connected BO3 planar triangles. It is suggested that growing density by glass compaction (up to 13%) causes severe deformation of boroxol rings, determining a decrease of structural units which preserve unaltered their vibrational activity. The density of compacted glasses, annealed at ambient temperature and pressure, is time-dependent and decreases to a lower constant value, but still higher than that of normal vitreous B2O3, evidencing a permanent plastic deformation. The final structural configuration is achieved over a period of few months during which the local strain is partially relaxed allowing some boroxol groups to recover their original shape and vibrational modes. Growing glass densification gives rise to a substantial hardening of the network with a well-defined linear increase of both the bulk and rigidity moduli, while leaving nearly constant the Poisson's ratio. Also the frequency LW of the Boson peak shifts from 26 cm(-1) in v-B2O3 up to 37 cm(-1) in the glass having the highest density (2069 kg/m(3)), this increase being stronger than that expected from the simple hardening of elastic continuum. The observed effects are consistent with the gradual vibrational collapse of boroxol rings driven by densification and emphasize the basic role of these glassy units in determining the softening degree and the low-energy vibrational dynamics of v-B2O3.

AB The atomic-structural, electronic, and optical properties of Sn-doped ZnO-P2O5 glasses are examined using combined semi-empirical and density functional theory calculations. From model structures for two different ZnO-P(2)O(5 )glass compositions, it is found that these glasses consist of nearly ideal tetrahedral PO4 unit and largely distorted ZnO4 and ZnO5 units. The concentration of ZnO5 units is calculated to increase and exceed that of ZnO4 as the amount of ZnO in the glass is increased. Also, the concentration of terminal oxygen atoms shared by two Zn neighbors is largely increased for 70ZnO:30P(2)O(5) (70:30) glass compared to 60:40 glass, which can be rationalized by electrostatic bond strength calculations. Regarding medium-range order, calculations show that Q(1) and Q(2) structures (where Q(n )refers to structures containing n bridging oxygen atoms on PO4 tetrahedra) are dominant for the 60:40 glass, while Q(0) and Q(1) prevail for the 70:30 glass, in good agreement with experimental observations. For the Sn-doped ZnO-P2O5 glass, various Sn coordination geometries are found, with trigonal pyramidal SnO3 and largely distorted pyramidal SnO4 configurations being dominant and a small fraction of two-fold and five-fold coordinated Sn configurations also present. From combined cluster and glass model calculations, two-fold coordinated Sn are found to exhibit slightly smaller optical transition energy than threefold and four-fold coordinated Sn. However, local variations in coordination structures throughout the glass likely result in a broad singlet transition (S-0 -> S-1) around 5.4 eV for all the different Sn configurations. A triplet transition (S-0 -> T-1) driven by spin-orbit coupling can occur around 4.5 - 4.8 eV, but the magnitude of this transition is predicted to be much smaller than the spin-allowed singlet transition.

AB Chalcogenide glasses have attracted a great deal of attention for the optical elements of infrared devices. The viscosity and elasticity of glasses are important characteristics for the use of precision molding techniques. The uniaxial compression creep behavior of Ge20Sb15Se65 glass was studied around its deformation temperature. The derived creep function was converted into relaxation moduli by Laplace transformation and its inversion. Analysis using a two-term Maxwell model revealed the shear relaxation modulus G(t) as two distinct structural relaxation processes with short and long relaxation times on the order of 10(1) s and 10(3) s, respectively, at 313 degrees C. The fast relaxation with high elasticity obeyed the time-temperature superposition principle and its activation energy Delta H-1 was estimated to be 350 +/- 10 kJ/mol using Narayanaswamy's relation. This energy is mainly comparable to the bond dissociation energies of Se-Se (similar to 320 kJ/mol). The process was therefore suggested to be due to motion around these thermally broken inter-atomic bonds, as in many glassy systems. In contrast, the low-elasticity slow relaxation process had activation energy of approximately 480 +/- 60 kJ/mol and was considered to represent breaking and rearrangement of heteronuclear Ge-Se and Sb-Se bonds in the glass network during pressure-induced entanglement.

AB Crystallization and inversion temperature of sol-gel derived high-quartz solid solutions (HQss) of composition LixAlxSi1-xO2 (with 0 <= x <= 0.2) in the pseudo-binary system SiO2-LiAlO2 (LAS) are studied. Lithium, aluminum and silicon containing precursors are used to prepare a sol to coat seeded silicon wafers with a thin amorphous LAS film. Using lithium disilicate as a seed material, HQss is formed readily at temperatures > 700 degrees C between the nominal compositions 83.3-100 mol% SiO2, whereas using zirconium titanate as seed, HQss crystallization is observed at higher temperatures ( > 950 degrees C) and only at the LiAl-rich side of the compositional join. HQss transforms to keatite solid solution and to high-cristobalite when heated above 1000-1100 degrees C, respectively. The chemical substitution of Si4+ by Al3+ + Li+ lead to an increase in the a o unit cell parameter. In films of x < 0.193 a reversible transformation of high-to-low quartz solid solution is evident. The quartz inversion temperature T-c decreased linearly with increasing x. The dependence is best described by the equation T-c (degrees C) = (569 +/- 3) - (2.82 +/- 0.06).10(3)x.

AB In this paper, the rheological behavior and thermoplastic deformation of Zr61.88Cu18Ni10.12Al10 bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) in the supercooled liquid region (SCLR) were studied by high temperature compression tests and a processing map was constructed. The results indicated that the flow stress of present alloy in the SCLR is very sensitive to temperature and strain-rate. The flow stress decreases with increasing temperature and decreasing strain-rate. The viscosity coefficient of the present alloy ranges from 10(11) Pa.s to 10(9) Pa.s and decreases with increasing temperature and strain-rate. When the strain-rate is greater than 5 x 10(-3) s(-1), the Zr61.88Cu18Ni10.12Al10 alloy undergoes a transition from Newtonian fluid to non-Newtonian fluid. The surface profile exhibited a similar shape of the letter 'N' after high temperature compression in the deeply SCLR. The optimum hot processing region of Zr61.88Cu18Ni10.12Al10 alloy is 688 K-708 K with a low strain-rate and 708 K-723 K with a high strain-rate.

The XRD pattern, TEM image, excitation and emission spectra of the samples were studied. The luminescent characteristics of the samples had been discussed in detail. The luminescent color of Mn2+-doped samples can vary from green to red by adjusting the ratio of SiO2 to P2O5. Under 360 nm excitation, the Mn2+/Tm3+-codoped sample can generate white light, whose CIE coordinate is (X = 0.328, Y = 0.314). The value is very close to the standard equal energy white-light illumination (X = 0.333, Y = 0.333). This study is helpful for exploring novel luminescent materials for white light-emitting diodes.

ID DECOMPOSITION
AB A combined Gaussian mixture model and hidden Markov model (HMM) Is developed to distinguish between slow moving animal and human targets using mel-cepstrum coefficients. This method is compared to the state-of-the-art in current micro-Doppler classification and an improvement in performance is demonstrated. In the proposed method, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) provides a mixture of mel-frequency distributions while a hidden Markov model is used to characterise class specific transitions between the mel-frequency mixtures over time. A database of slow moving targets in a cluttered environment is used to evaluate the performance of the model, It is shown that the combined Gaussian mixture Hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) approach can accurately distinguish between different classes of animals and humans walking in these environments. Results show that the classification accuracy of the model depends on the continuous observation time on target and ranges from 75% to approximately 90% for times on target between 250 ms and 1.25 s respectively. A confidence based rejection scheme is also presented to reduce false classification rates. Possible applications include border safeguarding and wildlife anti-poaching operations for species such as rhinos or elephants. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB As network-based threats continue to evolve more rapidly, detecting and responding to intrusion attempts in real-time requires an increasingly automated and intelligent response. This paper provides an agent-based framework for the analysis of cyber events within networks of varying sizes to detect complex multi-stage attacks. Agents are used as intelligent systems to explore domain specific and situational information showing the benefit of adaptive technologies that proactively analyse security events in real time. We introduce several algorithms to encapsulate and manage the traditional detection technologies and provide agent-based performance introspection as a mechanism to identify poorly performing systems. Our evaluation shows that the algorithms can reduce the amount of processing needed to analyse a security event by over 50% and improve the detection rate by up to 20% by introducing corrective systems to reduce false alarm rates in error-prone environments.

AB Sophisticated sensors of satellites help researchers collect detailed maps of land surface in various image wavebands. These wavebands are processed to form spectral features identifying distinct land structures. However, depending on the structures subject to the research topic, only a portion of collected features might be sufficient for identification. Aim of this study is to present a scheme to pick most valuable spectral features derived from ASTER imagery in order to distinguish four types of tree ensembles: 'Sugi' (Japanese Cedar), 'Hinoki' (Japanese Cypress), 'Mixed deciduous', and 'Others'. Forward selection, a type of wrapper techniques, was employed with four types of classifiers in several train/test splits. Final rank of each feature was determined by Condorcet ranking after application of each classifier. Results showed that among four classifiers, artificial neural networks helped the selection process choose the most valuable features and a high accuracy value of 90.42% (with a true skill statistics score of 91.26%) was obtained using only top-ten features. For feature sets in smaller sizes, support vector machines classifier also performed well and provided an accuracy of 80.33% (with a true skill statistics score of 81.84%) using only top-three features. With help of these findings, landscape data can be represented in smaller forms with spectral features having most discriminative power. This will help reduce processing time and storage needs of expert systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM
AB The sequencing of DNA goes through a step of fragment assembly, this step is known as DNA fragment assembly problem (FAP). Fragment assembly is considered as an NP-hard problem, which means there is no known polynomial-time exact approach, hence the need for meta-heuristics. Three major strategies are widely used to tackle this problem: greedy graph-based algorithms, de Bruijn graphs, and the overlay-layout-consensus (OLC) approach. In this paper, we propose an adaptation of the novel crow search algorithm (CSA) to solve the DNA fragment assembly problem following the OLC model. In order to accelerate the search process and improve the quality of the solutions, we combined CSA with a local search method. Using this combination we were able to obtain very accurate solutions for all the instances of the DNA fragment assembly problem we tested. In fact, our algorithm outperformed all other algorithms designed for the same purpose. Our contribution consists in the implementation of a new assembler for the DNA fragment assembly problem capable of finding for the first time the optimal solutions for 20 out of 30 instances. The approach we proposed to adapt CSA for a discrete optimization problem is a novelty. We preserved the semantics of the original algorithm by applying standard operators from evolutionary algorithms. Following the same approach can make adapting new algorithms for discrete problems more accessible and more efficient compared to mapping algorithms designed for continuous optimization to combinatorial problems.

ID IMAGE SEGMENTATION
AB Superpixels have many applications in visual information processing, and can be used to reduce redundant information of an image, as well as the computational complexity of other expensive tasks (e.g., image segmentation). In this work, an iterative hierarchical stochastic graph contraction (IHSGC) method for multi-scale superpixels generation is proposed. A stochastic strategy is used to generate multi-scale superpixels, and each superpixel is represented by a hierarchical tree and describes an image patch at fine and coarse scales simultaneously. The proposed method consists of two main steps. The first step initializes the method based on a multi-channel unsupervised stochastic over-segmentation at the pixel level. The proposed over-segmentation scheme actually performs hierarchical stochastic clustering of visual features (i.e. pixels, image patches, and potentially can be applied to other visual features as well), while preserving the local spatial relationships across different scales. The second step consists of an iterative hierarchical stochastic graph contraction method. Coarser scales are generated by graph contractions until the desired number of superpixels is obtained. The experimental results based on the popular Berkeley segmentation databases BSDS300 and BSDS500 suggest that the proposed approach potentially can perform better than comparative state-of-the-art methods in terms of boundary recall and under-segmentation error.

AB Feature selection, which is used to choose a subset of relevant features has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Typical feature selections include: traditional filters, mutual information based methods, clustering based methods and hybrid methods. As many feature selections cannot achieve the best features effectively and efficiently, a new hybrid feature selection method is proposed in this paper. First, the drawbacks of some existing feature relevance measurements are analyzed and a component cooccurrence based feature relevance measurement is proposed. Then, the implementation of the proposed feature selection is given: (1) the samples are preprocessed and two feature subsets are obtained by using two different optimal filters. (2) A feature weight based union operation is proposed to merge the obtained feature subsets. (3) As the hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm can produce clusters of high qualities without requiring the cluster number, it is applied to obtain the final feature subset by using a predetermined threshold. In the experiments, two typical classifiers: support vector machine and K-nearest neighbor are used on eight datasets (Lung-cancer, Breast-cancer-wisconsin, Arrhythmia, Arcene, CNAE-9, Madelon, Spambase and KDD-cup-1999), and the 10-cross validation is carried out when the (F1 )measurement is used. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed feature relevance measurement is superior to those of traditional methods. In addition, the proposed feature selection outperforms many existing typical methods on classification accuracy and execution speed, illustrating its effectiveness in achieving the best features.

AB In processing human produced text using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, two fundamental subtasks that arise are (i) segmentation of the plain text into meaningful subunits (e.g., entities), and (ii) dependency parsing, to establish relations between subunits. Such structural interpretation of text provides essential building blocks for upstream expert system tasks: e.g., from interpreting textual real estate ads, one may want to provide an accurate price estimate and/or provide selection filters for end users looking for a particular property - which all could rely on knowing the types and number of rooms, etc. In this paper, we develop a relatively simple and effective neural joint model that performs both segmentation and dependency parsing together, instead of one after the other as in most state-of-the-art works. We will focus in particular on the real estate ad setting, aiming to convert an ad to a structured description, which we name property tree, comprising the tasks of (1) identifying important entities of a property (e.g., rooms) from classifieds and (2) structuring them into a tree format. In this work, we propose a new joint model that is able to tackle the two tasks simultaneously and construct the property tree by (i) avoiding the error propagation that would arise from the subtasks one after the other in a pipelined fashion, and (ii) exploiting the interactions between the subtasks. For this purpose, we perform an extensive comparative study of the pipeline methods and the new proposed joint model, reporting an improvement of over three percentage points in the overall edge F-1 score of the property tree. Also, we propose attention methods, to encourage our model to focus on salient tokens during the construction of the property tree. Thus we experimentally demonstrate the usefulness of attentive neural architectures for the proposed joint model, showcasing a further improvement of two percentage points in edge F-1 score for our application. While the results demonstrated are for the particular real estate setting, the model is generic in nature, and thus could be equally applied to other expert system scenarios requiring the general tasks of both (i) detecting entities (segmentation) and (ii) establishing relations among them (dependency parsing).

DE Support vector machine; Radius-margin ratio; Error bounds; LogDet
   regularization; Fraud detection system
AB Theoretically, support vector machines (SVMs) have general error bounds along a radius-margin ratio, while conventional SVMs consider only the maximization of the margin and ignore the minimization of the radius, which is sensitive to affine data transformations. Thus, conventional SVMs can be improved by controlling both the radius and the margin. Several SVM variants based on radius-margin ratio error bounds have been proposed to integrate the radius and margin. However, most of these either require a diagonal transformation matrix or are computationally expensive to optimize. In this paper, we propose a novel radius-margin-based SVM model with LogDet regularization called L-SVM. In our model, we consider the radius and introduce a negative LogDet term to improve the model accuracy. We also adopt a two-step alternating minimization strategy to obtain an optimal solution, which leads to impressive computational improvements. Our experimental results validate the performance of the L-SVM and show that the L-SVM achieves significantly higher accuracy and efficiency compared to conventional SVMs and some other state-of-the-art radius-margin-based SVM methods. In addition, we apply our proposed L-SVM to solve transaction fraud problems and propose a framework for an L-SVM-based fraud detection system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates a new approach for finding efficient solutions of a multi-objective programming problem (MOPP) in intuitionistic fuzzy environment (IFE) based on decision maker's different views, viz., optimistic, pessimistic and mixed. Firstly, the point operator F-alpha, which transforms intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) into the equivalent fuzzy set (FS), is introduced and some desirable properties of F-alpha are studied. Subsequently, the formulation of MOPP, accuracy function and value function in IFE have been introduced. For resolving the mutual conflicting nature of objectives in MOPP in IFE, we introduce the membership and non-membership functions governed by reference function which do not depend on the upper and lower levels of acceptability. Then a new method is proposed to find the efficient solutions of MOPP in IFE based on different viewpoints. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The facility layout problem (FLP) is the problem of placing facilities in a certain shop floor so that facilities do not overlap each other and are satisfied with some given objectives. Considering practical situations, this study focuses on the multi-objective unequal-area facility layout problem (UA-FLP), where the facilities have unequal-areas and fixed shapes and are placed orthogonally in the continuous shop floor. The objectives of the problem aim to optimize the material handling cost, the total adjacency value and the utilization ratio of the shop floor. The chief difficulties of this version of the FLP lie in the satisfaction of non-overlapping constraint between any two different facilities and the optimization of multiple objectives in the huge solution space. In this paper, we put forward a heuristic configuration mutation operation and subsequent local search based on the gradient method to satisfy the non-overlapping constraint, and the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm, which has recently proven its high effectiveness and robustness in solving multi-objective problems, to obtain a set of Pareto-optimal solutions of the problem. The novelty of the paper lies in the use of an objective space division method in the MOPSO which governs the neighborhood topology and the local best swarm used to assess the global fitness of a solution and choose the global leader particle. The proposed algorithm is tested on three sets of different UA-FLPs from the literature with the size of the problem up to 62 facilities. The numerical results show that the proposed method is effective in solving the multi-objective UA-FLP. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which are among the primary polysomnography (PSG) signals used for sleep staging, are difficult to obtain and interpret. However, it is much easier to obtain and interpret electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The use of ECG signals for automatic sleep staging systems could bring practicality to these systems. In this study, ECG signals were used to identify the wake (W), non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) stages of the sleep data from two different databases with 17,758 epochs of 28 subjects (21 healthy subjects and 7 obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients) in total. Four different methods were used to extract features from these signals: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT), and Morphological method. As a result of applying the methods separately, four different data sets were obtained. The four different datasets were given to the Wrapper Subset Evaluation system with the best-first search algorithm. After the feature selection procedure, the datasets were separately classified by using the Random Forest classifier. The results were interpreted by using the essential statistical criteria. Among the methods, morphological method was the most successful and it was followed by SVD in terms of success rate for both two databases. For the first database, the mean classification accuracy rate, Kappa coefficient and mean F-measure value of the Morphological method were found as 87.11%, 0.7369, 0.869 for the healthy and 78.08%, 0.5715, 0.782 for the patient, respectively. For the second database, the same statistical measures were determined as 77.02%, 0.4308, 0.755 for the healthy and 76.79%, 0.5227, 0.759 for the patient, respectively. The performance results of the study, which is consistent with real life applications, were compared with the previous studies in this field listed in the literature. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Over the past decades, the reliability-based design optimization of truss structures has been still a major challenge for engineering designers and even for researchers because of its complexities and high computational cost. In this paper, a new approach based on a novel combination of multi-objective evolutionary optimization and reliability analysis is proposed to deal with such kinds of problems. The proposed method consists of two separate steps. First, a multi-objective design optimization problem is formulated and solved by a multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm. Secondly, reliability analysis problems are formed by taking into account the uncertainty of input data of the problem, and a reliability analysis method is used to evaluate the reliability of all solutions obtained at the first step. Based on the obtained reliability, the suitable optimal solutions with a certain level of reliability can be readily identified. The proposed approach has some advantages such as: 1) it can give a set of many optimal solutions with different levels of reliability by only one run; 2) it can easily handle the design optimization problems of truss structures with continuous, discrete or mixed continuous-discrete design variables; 3) it is quite simple for engineering designers to understand and implement. To demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed method, three examples of truss structures are carried out, and the obtained results are compared to those available in the literature. The acquired results reveal that the proposed approach is reliable and more competitive compared to other methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Currently, the range of applications of mobile robots has extended substantially thanks to the evolution of the sensing and computing technologies. In this field, creating accurate and compact models of the environment is crucial so that the robot can estimate its position and move autonomously to the target points. Among the available alternatives, computer vision sensors have become of utmost importance to create these models, thanks to the richness of the data they can capture. However, they require the implementation of algorithms to extract relevant information from the scenes. In this work, a framework to create a model of a priori unknown environments is presented, which is based on the global appearance of images. The model is created on-line, as the robot explores the environment and the result is a graph whose nodes contain images and the links represent relative distance between them. The framework includes a schema that fuses the information extracted from the scenes with the angle information provided by the odometry of the robot, considering the relative reliability of each piece of information. Also, a loop closure detection algorithm is proposed, which corrects the position of the nodes and updates the map. A set of experiments has been conducted to study the influence of the most relevant parameters upon the accuracy of the model and the computational cost of the process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Silica and its derivative as a major component of earth mantel have long been believed to have profound effects on the evolution of nature and life. In this article, the wetting behaviors of silica and its derivatives after heat treatment are investigated. We obtain a superhydrophilic surface on soda-lime glass by heat treatment, but not on fused quartz and single crystal silica. The annealed soda-lime glass exhibits excellent anti-fog effect and can maintain at hydrophilic state in the air for one month. The glass is also highly transparent throughout the visible light region and exhibits excellent ultraviolet resistance and mechanical stability. The wettability transition is attributed to increased surface roughness and heat-induced composition variation. This investigation may shed light on the design and fabrication of novel glass products. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this research, annealing treatments at 550-950 degrees C for 4-20 min on 70% cold rolled supersaturated ferrite in a duplex stainless steel resulted in the formation of nano-sized austenite at grain boundaries, shear bands and sub-boundaries. The microstructural observations indicated that the recovery in ferrite precedes the austenite transformation at 550 degrees C. However, at higher annealing temperatures, transformation to austenite restricts the recovery in ferrite and rapidly consumes the deformation energy. It was observed that the nano austenite particles pin the ferrite sub-boundaries and avoid their migration. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A facile thermal evaporation is utilized to deposit copper selenide thin films at different substrate temperatures (T-s). Impact of substrate temperature on the film structure, morphology, optical and electrical properties was investigated. Structural transformation from orthorhombic to cubic phase with different stoichiometric compositions is evident upon an increase in substrate temperature. Film morphology demonstrates various shapes from scattered grains to columnar crystals upon heat treatment. The optical analysis illustrates strong absorption in the blue region and the band gap values lies in the range 1.54 eV-2.54 eV. The electrical resistivity was found to be in the order of 10(-4) Omega cm. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB By using an alpha-amino acid as an interfacial protector and pH adjustor, we demonstrate the synthesis of the long-range ordered mesoporous alumina (OMA) via a modified solvent evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) method. Characterization results of XRD, TEM, and N-2 adsorption-desorption indicate that the long-range highly ordered OMA was successfully obtained by using aluminum iso-propoxide as a precursor and Pluronic P123 as a template via the alpha-amino acid assisted EISA process. Moreover, by simply changing the alpha-amino acid, the textural property of the OMA was easily regulated, the extent of which depends on the molecular structure and coordination ability of the alpha-amino acid. The facile formation of the long-range highly ordered OMA was explained based on the function of the alpha-amino acids. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB (Ba1-xNdx)(Ti1-y-x/4Cey)O-3 (BNTC) ceramics with a pseudo-cubic structure were prepared using the mixed oxide method. The dielectric-peak temperature decreased rapidly at a rate of -27 degrees C/at.% Nd for BNTC with y = 0.05. BNTC with x = y = 0.05 (BN5TC5) exhibited a high-permittivity diffuse phase transition behavior but had a higher dielectric loss (tan delta = 0.219). A high-permittivity (epsilon'(RT) = 14100) and low-loss (tan delta = 0.014) X7V ceramic was achieved by means of the addition of 1% Ce in BN5TC5. A g = 2.509 electron spin resonance (ESR) signal associated with Ce3+ Kramers ions confirmed the existence of mixed valence states of Ce3+/Ce4+. A g = 2.151 ESR signal of Nd3+ can be detected at room temperature after these ceramics were preserved over a long period of time. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID GROWTH
AB An exceedingly high-quality second and third-order nonlinear optical (TONLO) single crystal trisglycine epsomite (TGE) has been grown productively using aqueous solution by conventional solution growth method. Single crystal XRD confirms the distortion of crystal structure from orthorhombic to triclinic with space group. CHN analysis authenticates the occurrence of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen in the grown crystal. FTIR studies substantiate the existence of functional groups. The optical transmission studies proves the transparency of the sample in the entire visible region and band gap was determined using Tauc's plot. The output intensity of SHG was verified by Kurtz and Perry powder technique and it was found to be 0.792 times greater than that of KDP. TONLO properties such as nonlinear refraction (NLR), nonlinear absorption (NLA), third-order susceptibility (chi(3)) and hyperpolarizability (gamma) were determined with high accuracy using effectively attributes to self-defocusing effect also with high third-order susceptibility comparing to other NLO crystals. SEM analysis reveals the surface morphology of the grown crystal. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sr-Cu co-substituted mesoporous bioactive glasses were synthesized by two different sol-gel approaches: an ultrasound-assisted base-catalyzed sol-gel procedure and an aerosol-assisted spray-drying method. The produced spherical shaped particles showed high specific surface area values and tunable pore size. The two different routes allowed obtaining samples with different morphology and size, characterized by the ability to induce hydroxyapatite deposition, to incorporate a specific amount of therapeutic ions (strontium with the aim to improve bone formation and copper for its antibacterial and pro-angiogenic properties) and to release them. The obtained multifunctional biomaterials synergistically combine the ability to promote bone formation and angiogenesis and to impart an antibacterial effect. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Synthetic biodegradable polymers are of great interest in the biomedical field; however, their biocompatibility is not always adequate for tissue engineering applications. Surface treatment and secondary bioactive phase incorporation have been reported as means of resolving such issues. In this work, biodegradable polyurethane (PU) film biocompatibility was improved with the incorporation of bioactive glass via ultrasonic method. Structural analysis revealed successful PU-glass composite formation, and MTT cytotoxic testing reported increased bioactivity via bioactive glass incorporation. The synthesised films furthermore exhibited great flexibility, with up to 889.3% elongation and increased maximum stress at failure. Ultrasonic implantation is therefore a promising potential method to obtain superior polyurethane films for biomedical applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

PEG-b-PLL is a moderate antibacterial polymer itself with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 43.8 mu g/mL, and it inhibits bacteria by the electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions with bacteria membrane. EDTA induces the lipopolysaccharide release and enhanced membrane permeability of E. coli, and affects the divalent ion equilibrium on the bacteria membrane. The self-assembly of PEG-b-PLL and EDTA into spindly nanofibers, showing synergistic inhibition of E. coli (MIC: 10.9 mu g/mL).

AB Localized drug delivery from vascular scaffolds can effectively prevent restenosis after stenting procedures. However, one of the current challenge remains to provide controlled release of antirestenotic drug and identify drug eluting mechanisms. The aim of study was to analyze the influence of polymer forming eluting layer, drug and intermolecular interactions on the release process. In vitro release of sirolimus or paclitaxel from coating of scaffolds obtained from poly(L,L-lactide)-co-trimethylene carbonate and poly (D,L-lactide)-co-trimethylene carbonate was studied. Differences between paclitaxel and sirolimus elution from crystalline copolymer were observed due to intermolecular interactions. Interaction of drug with amorphous polymer did not affect release process. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Because of symmetry configuration, the designed metamaterial possesses stable polarization- independent and wide-angle transmission spectral features. Moreover, the design has a simple structure ideally suitable for the current planar micro- and nano-fabrications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, we report a universal approach for fabricating mesoporous Pt nanowires with controlled mesostructures from a dual template using anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane with silica nanospheres assembled in the channels. The mesoporous Pt nanowires with well-ordered mesopores are successfully prepared by chemical reduction deposition method. In addition, we show a variety of mesopore arrangements in the Pt nanowires (such as linear, zigzag, and meshy topologies) for different values of the D (the ratio of the AAO channel (d(1)) and silica sphere diameter (d(2))) factor ranging between 1 and 1+root 2 (approximate to 2.414). The present approach is anticipated to work on the preparation of mesoporous nanowires of other metals (e.g., Au, Ni, and Pd) or alloys (e.g., Pt-Ni and Pt-Ru alloys) with various topologies that may be promising as potential candidates for the next generation nanodevices and other applications (e.g., fuel cells and catalysis).

AB Improving the mechanical properties and maintaining the desired degradability of the bioceramic scaffold is always being a contradiction in the field of bone tissue engineering. To resolve this conflict, highly degradable mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) was homogenously coated on the mechanically stronger hardystonite (Ca2ZnSi2O7, HT) scaffolds. The presence of MBG on the scaffold covers the shortage of the bioactive ions released from the underlying HT scaffold in the initial stage and provides a better platform for cellular adhesion. Results proved that the HT scaffold coated with MBG (HT/M) exhibited appealing biological properties, pointing out their potential application in bone tissue engineering. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Iron germanium sulfide (Fe2GeS4) recently emerged as a potential thin film solar photovoltaic absorber. The introduction of the third element-germanium (Ge)-viewed as a solution for overcoming multiple barriers of a photovoltaic pyrite, confers stability to Fe2GeS4 at elevated temperatures, typically required for accomplishing grain growth in Gen 2 thin film PV. A facile synthesis of Fe2GeS4 nanoparticles from molecular precursors, comprising mechanical mixing of starting materials followed by a two-hour annealing in a sulfur-rich atmosphere is presented herein. Further processing of the resulting Fe2GeS4 nanopowders at elevated temperatures demonstrates high thermal stability of Fe2GeS4 (up to 500 degrees C), in comparison with pyrite, which shows onset of pyrrhotite upon heating above 160 degrees C. Based on the secondary crystalline phases formed, we propose a mechanism of decomposition of Fe2GeS4 at high temperatures. Films fabricated with Fe2GeS4 were further annealed and revealed that Fe2GeS4 withstands high temperatures in thin film. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Developing new technologies that could lead to alternatives to the traditional silicon-based solar panels and to efficiently light the world in the future, is critically important because of limited natural petroleum resources. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promisingly efficient and clean hybrid, organic-inorganic, low-cost molecular solar cell devices. Because of their unique, multifunctional properties, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures are promising materials to use to create photoanodes for DSSCs. ZnO was one of the first metal oxides which used in dye-sensitized solar cells. It exhibits a unique combination of potentially interesting properties such as high bulk electron mobility and probably the richest variety of nanostructures based on a very wide range of synthesis routes. The fabricated ZnO nanoneedle based DSSCs shows a short circuit current density (J(sc)) of 20 mA/cm(2), open circuit voltage (V-oc) of 0.48 V, fill factor (FF) of 0.44 and efficiency (eta) of 4.2% at one sun condition.

AB SnO2 crystals with different morphologies were fabricated via simple thermal evaporation of a mixture of Sn and graphite powders at 1000 degrees C in air at atmospheric pressure without any catalysts. When a mixture with a high weight ratio of graphite to Sn was used as source material, SnO2 crystals with belt morphology were formed. The crystals had widths in the range of 2-5 mu m, and lengths up to several hundred micrometers. As the weight ratio of graphite to Sn in source material decreased, SnO2 nanoparticles with spherical morphology were synthesized. The nanoparticles had typical diameters of 100-300 nm. With further decreasing the weight ratio of graphite to Sn, the morphology of the SnO2 crystals changed from particle to wire and rod. The diameters of the wire-and the rod-shaped crystals were in the range of 50-150 nm and 0.5-1.0 mm, respectively. The morphology of the SnO2 crystals could be easily changed by adjusting the ratio of Sn and graphite in source material. This reveals that the ratio of graphite and Sn in source material is a critical factor to influence the morphology of SnO2 crystals. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sensors based on metal oxide semiconductors have been widely applied for the detection of several volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, the development of sensing materials with high selectivity, improved sensitivity, low detection limit is still a challenge. In this work, bicone-like ZnO structure was synthesized by a rapid template-free microwave-assisted hydrothermal method and then applied as VOC sensor. The VOC-sensing tests revealed that ZnO structure presented a higher response toward butanone than to other VOCs, such as benzene, toluene, m-xylene, acetone, ethanol, acetaldehyde, and isopropanol. Moreover, the ZnO-based sensor showed an enhanced butanone-sensing performance at 400 degrees C, including a response of 29.4-100 ppm of butanone, high sensitivity to detect low butanone concentration (2 ppm), and a low detection limit of 0.41 ppm. Therefore, the unique bicone-like ZnO structure might be a promising candidate for butanone sensors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Yb/Ho: CaLaGa3O7 as mid-IR laser crystal was successfully grown by the Czochralski method for the first time. The effects of Yb3+ on the structure parameters and spectroscopic properties have been investigated. In comparison with Ho3+ singly-doped CaLaGa3O7 crystal, Yb3+ not only enhances 2.86 mu m emission but also depopulates the Ho3+: I-5(7) level in Yb/Ho: CaLaGa3O7 crystal, which is beneficial to the possible population inversion for Ho3+: I-5(6) -> I-5(7). Results indicate that the prepared Yb/Ho: CaLaGa3O7 crystal is a promising candidate for 2.86 mu m mid-infrared laser applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mullite precursors were prepared using kaolin waste, sericite clay containing kaolinite and industrial kaolin with addition of alumina in a wet medium to synthesize mullite (72 wt% Al2O3 and 28 wt% SiO2). Uniaxial pressed bars of the powdered mullite precursors were fired in the range 1400-1600 degrees C with soaking times 30-120 min. The resultant materials were studied by XRD and SEM-EDX. Bulk densities, apparent porosities and flexural strengths in four points were determined in the fired bars at 1500, 1550 and 1600 degrees C. It was concluded that the thermal behaviour of these mullite precursors was influenced by the presence of impurities in the raw materials. These impurities originate a liquid phase forming a glassy phase which produces a progressive and enhanced densification of the mullite materials by reaction sintering at 1500-1600 degrees C. The technical properties were also influenced by the relative proportion of vitreous phase. The microstructure of characteristic mullite crystals was revealed by SEM. It was emphasized the use of kaolin waste by-products of mining and sericite clays as valuable raw materials for mullite preparation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Bamboo; Vacuum-assisted; Microwave drying; Mechanical property
AB Round bamboos hold great promise for replacing wood as structural materials due to their easy large-scale cultivation, rapid growth, high strength and high toughness. However, rapid drying of round bamboo with good quality remains a key challenge. Here, vacuum-assisted microwave drying (VMD) technology is firstly applied to dry round bamboo. It only takes similar to 150 min to reduce the moisture content of bamboo to similar to 10%. The resulting dried bamboos not only have a smooth surface, superior gloss, uniform golden color and few striking defects, but also show good mechanical performance. Moreover, few splitting, cracking, even "Firecrackers" occur during the drying process, which could not be avoided by conventional drying method. Thus, VMD technology shows a great potential application in drying round bamboo in industry. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Curcumin is a proven antioxidant and anti-cancerous compound found in Curcuma longa. However, the low solubility of curcumin limits its usefulness in therapeutics. To make curcumin more bioavailable, we have functionalized gamma-Fe2O3 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with curcumin through the biodegradable polymer chitosan. The MNPs were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Transvers Electron Microscopy (TEM), BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) and a Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The antioxidant potential of curcumin loaded on chitosan coated MNPs (CMNPs) was subsequently investigated using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and investigated for its pH triggered curcumin releasing capacity. CMNPs showed pH responsive curcumin release and release at pH 6.0 (similar to 40%) was more than at pH 7.4 (similar to 20%) after 6 days. Nanoformulated CMNPs possesses good antioxidant activity with pH triggered curcumin releasing capacity and of high potential value for biomedical use. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel flower-like CoFe2O4@graphene composites were prepared using a spray drying technique in combination with a solvothermal method, followed by calcination. Hundreds of uniform CoFe2O4 microspheres are encapsulated with gauzy graphene to form large flower-like composites. This unique structure effectively reduces agglomeration of graphene and enhances microwave absorption performances. The minimum reflection loss of as-obtained flower-like CoFe2O4@graphene composites reaches -42 dB at 12.9 GHz with a thickness of 2 mm, and the effective absorption frequency (RL < -10 dB) is 4.59 GHz from 11.2 to 15.79 GHz. Flower-like CoFe2O4@graphene composites show better microwave absorbing performance than pure CoFe2O4 microspheres. These CoFe2O4@graphene composites are promising as light weight, broad frequency bandwidth and strong absorption microwave absorbers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Homogeneously dispersed nano-TiN particles are introduced into the different grain-size skutterudite compounds Co4Sb11.5Te0.5 through ball milling and spark plasma sintering. The phase purity, microstructures, and thermoelectric properties of all the samples are characterized. The results prove that the sample consisted of the finest grain (similar to 220 nm) Co4Sb11.5Te0.5 and nano-TiN demonstrates a much lower thermal conductivity of 2.34 Wm(-1) K-1 at room temperature and a highest ZT value of 1.07 at 800 K. Furthermore, annealing this sample at 500 degrees C for 50 h shows minor changes in structure and ZT value, indicating an excellent thermal stability. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Spinel-type Li4Ti5O12 has peculiar advantages in ultralong cyclic lifespan and high safety. However, its intrinsic low electrical conductivity strongly restricts its applications. Self-assembled mesoporous Li4Ti5O12/C hollow spheres have been obtained through an aerosol pathway, in which the mesoporous shells consist of Li4Ti5O12 nanoparticles embedded in amorphous carbon. Electrochemical performance of the mesoporous Li4Ti5O12/C hollow spheres has been evaluated, which demonstrate their excellent cyclic capacity, stability and rate capability for high power-density and long lifespan lithium-ion batteries. The initial reversible capacity reaches 164.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C, which is 93.9% or 98.3% of the theoretical capacity with or without carbon content. The capacity fading rate of each cycle is as low as 0.012%. A self-assembly mechanism of the mesoporous Li4Ti5O12/C hollow spheres has been proposed, which is expected to be beneficial for self-assembling hollow spherical structures with applications in batteries.

AB For the first time, a facile one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method of Na0.9MnO2 nanowires (NWs) was successfully reported. Starting from Mn2O3 particles, we are able to grow Na0.9MnO2 in one step via simple hydrothermal method. The products are highly crystalline NWs with high density. The NWs' length and density can be controlled by varying NaOH concentration during the growth. High performance electrochemical capacitors are fabricated by using Na0.9MnO2 NWs as electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry measurements reveal excellent mass-specific capacitance of 183 Fg (1) at 5 mVs (1). Na0.9MnO2 NWs also exhibit a reliable charge-discharge, cycle stability, and low internal resistance. Our study demonstrates Na0.9MnO2 is synthesized in NW morphology in a facile, simple, and efficient way. The excellent electrochemical characteristics of Na0.9MnO2 NWs suggest they could be employed as novel, next-generation electrodes for electrochemical energy storage devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Antibacterial central venous catheters (CVC) have been in great demand in recent years. However, biomedical polyurethane (PU), the most used polymer for CVC extrusion, lacks antibacterial properties, surface coating after catheter extrusion or additives is generally required for fabricating antibacterial CVC. To develop antibacterial PU for CVC extrusion, a natural derived substance, benzoic acid, was thus grafted onto a PU with pendant alkynyl groups successfully through Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition click reaction in this research. The synthesized PU tethering benzoic acid (PUB) was fabricated into catheter which displays a suitable strength for CVC application. PUB tethering benzoic acid over 2 mmol/g has proved good antibacterial properties against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus based on a bacterial colony forming units test, and bone mesenchymal stem cells proliferation on PUB also demonstrate good cell compatibilities, suggesting PUB a promising polymer for CVC extrusion.

AB A very small amount of immiscible solutes can dramatically decrease the ability of dislocations to nucleate from grain boundaries. In this paper we report the results of the molecular dynamics simulations which show that at larger concentrations, the solute effect becomes rather non-trivial: there are concentration ranges where even small addition of solutes considerably suppresses the dislocation nucleation from grain boundaries and there are concentration ranges where addition of new solutes almost does not change the dislocation nucleation ability. We reveal the atomic mechanism of these effects. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Additive manufacturing by selective electron beam melting (SEBM) was used to process a powder mixture consisting of elemental copper and chromium powders (nominal composition: Cu-25Cr). The melting temperatures of copper and chromium are largely different. As a result, the copper particles start melting while the chromium ones are still solid. Eventually, also the chromium particles get molten since the local temperatures during SEBM are rather high. The microstructure was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and focused ion beam (FIB)-SEM. It was observed that ultra-fine Cr particles are formed and distributed in the Cu matrix due to the fast cooling rate and subsequent spinodal decomposition. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Amperometric biosensor utilizing FAD-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH) for a specific sucrose monitoring in green coffee is described. FAD-GDH was co-immobilized with invertase and mutarotase on a thin-layer gold planar electrode using chitosan. The biosensor showed a wide linearity (from 10 to 1200 mu M), low detection limit (8.4 mu M), fast response time (50 s), and appeared to be O2 independent. In addition the biosensors exhibited a good operational (3 days) and storage (1 year) stability. Finally, the results achieved from the biosensor measurements of sucrose in 17 samples of green coffee (Coffea arabica, C. canephora and C. liberica) were compared with those obtained by the standard HPLC method. The good correlation among results of real samples, satisfactory analytical performance and simple use of the presented biosensor make it suitable for application in coffee industry.

AB An in vitro dialyzability approach has been undertaken to elucidate the bioavailable fraction of the total polyphenols (TPs) of edible nuts and seeds. The TP contents in samples and in dialyzates were assessed by the Folin-Ciocalteu spectrophotometric method. Antioxidant activity was determined in selected samples, using a modified method against Trolox (R). TPs and antioxidant activity in nuts/seeds were determined after applying a pressurized liquid extraction sample pre-treatment. High dialyzability ratios were assessed in most nuts/seeds (TP dialyzability percentages within the 25-91% range). The highest TP dialyzability ratios were found in raw Brazil nuts (81 +/- 5%), toasted pistachios (88 +/- 9%), and fried cashews (89 +/- 9%), whereas TPs in pumpkin seeds were found to be very low (TPs were not detected in the dialyzable fraction). TP dialyzability was correlated with the copper content in nuts and seeds.

AB The effect of electron beam irradiation at doses of 0-9 kGy on the biochemical properties and structure of myofibrillar protein from Tegillarca granosa (T. granosa) was investigated. There was no effect of irradiation on the surface hydrophobicity of the myofibrillar protein, however total sulfhydryl content and Ca2+-ATPase activity both declined to varying extents with increasing irradiation dose. Irradiation also affected the composition of the myofibrillar protein; with increasing dose of irradiation, the actin, paramyosin and myosin heavy chain contents of the myofibrillar protein were partially degraded. Irradiation reduced the a-helix content and increased the beta-sheet content but these effects were less dependent on the dose of irradiation. The 'hardness', 'gumminess', 'chewiness' and 'resilience' of T. granosa meat were improved at irradiation doses of 3-5 kGy. Collectively, our results support an optimum irradiation dose of 3-5 kGy for the preservation of T. granosa meat.

AB Recently, studies on human salt taste sensitivity demonstrated that sodium chloride (NaCl) sensitive and nonsensitive subjects differed in their salivary proteome and, in particular, in endopeptidase activity. In order to investigate individual's NaCl sensitivity and the role of endoprotease activity in salt taste perception, 20 panellists were classified according to NaCl sensitivity and saliva samples collected. A targeted protein quantitation by means of selected-reaction-monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry and stable-isotope incorporation revealed the joint abundance of lysozyme C and lipocalin-1 to be indicative for non-sensitive subjects. Sensory studies performed after oral challenge with the serine-type endopeptidase trypsin demonstrated a salt enhancing effect which was assumed to be due to an in-vivo generation of salt-modulating peptides as shown by LC-SWATH-MS. Amongst those, the tetrapeptide PLWR was found to elicit salty taste enhancing activity above an extraordinarily low taste threshold concentration of 6.5 mu mol/ L.

AB The low stability of proteins and peptides in liquid systems restricts the development of enzymatic hydrolysate. In this study, a variety of protein hydrolysates from Mytilus edulis (PHM) were prepared by enzymatic hydrolysis. The effects of four kinds of polysaccharides, CMC-Na, xanthan gum, beta-cyclodextrin, and Z-trim, on the stability of PHM were investigated by comparing the protein precipitation rate, particle size, zeta potential, microstructure, and fluorescence spectra. Results showed that the aqueous mixture enriched with proteins and peptides was stabilized by the addition of 1 mg/mL xanthan gum at pH 8, and it significantly prevented protein deposition. Particle size and zeta potential measurements confirmed the beneficial effects of xanthan gum on the stability of PHM. This study provides some theoretical references for the research and development of proteins from M. edulis.

AB Oat bran was fermented by filamentous fungi to improve the extractability of beta-glucan. Box-Behnken experimental design and response surface methodology were used to obtain the maximum extractability of beta-glucan. Inoculum volume, fermentation temperature, and time were evaluated as three variables. Under optimal fermentation conditions, the extractability of beta-glucan in oat bran increased to 45.57 +/- 1.82% and 51.10 +/- 2.32% by Aspergillus niger and Rhizopus oryzae, respectively. The extractability was about 3-fold of that before fermentation (16.86 +/- 0.76%). Fermentation of oat bran by Aspergillus niger and Rhizopus oryzae reduced the molecular weight of the extracted beta-glucan from 6.74 x 10(5) to 2.84 x 10(5) and 2.20 x 10(5) Da, respectively. Correspondingly, the apparent viscosity of the extracted beta-glucan decreased after fermentation. But the increased extractability compensated for the reduced molecular weight in the formation of viscous solution. The molecular structure and cellotriosyl/cellotetraosyl ratio were not affected by filamentous fungi fermentation.

AB Freeze drying represents the current practice to stabilize mealworms, even though it is an energy demanding technique. Therefore, it was examined in the present study whether microwave drying could be a proper alternative. To this end, the impact of both drying techniques on the proximate composition, vitamin B-12 content, fatty acid profile, oxidation status and colour parameters of mealworms was investigated. Furthermore, the influence of the application of vacuum during microwave drying was studied. The different drying technologies resulted in small differences in the proximate composition, while the vitamin B-12 content was only reduced by microwave drying. The fat fraction of freeze dried mealworms showed a higher oxidation status than the fat of microwave dried mealworms. Application of a vacuum during the microwave drying process did not appear to offer advantages. This research shows that for mealworms microwave drying can be a proper alternative to freeze drying.

AB Chia is a food plant producing seeds which have seen increasing interest owing to their health benefits. This work is the first report on the metabolite profile, total polyphenols and antioxidant activity of chia seeds, determined by ultrasound-assisted extraction, coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (UAE GC-MS). Different chia sources were compared: two commercial (black and white) and three early flowering (G3, G8 and G17) mutant genotypes. Organic extracts were mainly composed of mono-and polyunsaturated fatty acids with alpha-linolenic being the most abundant. Polar extracts contained sucrose, methylgalactoside and glucose as main sugars. Antioxidant activity and total polyphenolic content were correlated. Chemical composition and yield potential of early flowering genotypes were different from commercial chia, and while white chia showed the highest content of omega-3 fatty acids, the high content of nutraceuticals in G17 and G8 suggests them as a potential source of raw materials for the food/feed industry.

AB Information on the retention of vitamin D in food following household cooking is scarce. So far the retention of its metabolites vitamin D3, vitamin D-2, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3 has shown that the type of food and the cooking method are the essential determinants, and there is no significant difference between the metabolites. We investigated the retention of vitamin D-3 and vitamin D-2 in sunflower oil, vitamin D-3 in rainbow trout, and vitamin D-2 in button mushrooms. The investigated cooking methods were boiling at different pH, steam cooking, microwave cooking, pan-frying, and oven baking.
   There was no difference between the retention of vitamin D-3 and vitamin D-2 added to sunflower oil, which ranged from 70 to 99%. In rainbow trout, the retention of vitamin D-3 at 85-114% was not significantly different from 100%, except for panfrying at 85%. However, the retention of vitamin D-2 in mushrooms at 62-88% was significantly different from 100% (p <= 0.05).

AB Reducing sugars have strong reactivity with 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP) to form the sugar-PMP derivatives, which can be more accurately analyzed by HPLC-UV at 248 nm. Glucose and glucosamine reacted with the PMP based on the response surface methodology within a range of temperature between 60 degrees C and 80 degrees C, and time between 60 and 180 min. The optimal conditions for the glucose-PMP and glucosamine-PMP reactions were obtained at 71 degrees C for 129 min, and 73 degrees C for 96 min, respectively. Subsequently, other sugars and their derivatives, including xylose, ribose, fructose, galactose, mannose, lactose, maltose, sucrose, glucuronic acid, sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, and cyclodextrins were investigated and compared under the optimized condition for glucose. All of the above compounds, except the fructose, sugar alcohols and non-reducing sugars, could form the sugar-PMP derivatives. This study demonstrated that different chemical structures of sugars and their derivatives could significantly influence the rate and yield of the PMP derivatization.

AB The aim of the study was to determine the activity of four rye peptides and molecular descriptors responsible for the detected biological function. The activity was determined using hydroxyl radical scavenging and chromium-VI (Cr(VI) reducing assays while the density functional theory (DFT) was used for molecular descriptors (i.e. structure-activity relationships). It was found that at pH 7.4, peptide CQV had the highest Cr(VI) reducing activity (76%) followed by QCA (30.8%) while other peptides had less than 25% reduction. All tested peptides were less active at pH 3.0 and this was due to poor spatial proximity of thiol and amine on the glutamine side chain. In the hydroxyl radical scavenging assay, CQV had the highest activity with 28.9 +/- 1.3% inhibition of the formation of HO center dot radicals compared to 19.0-13.6% for other peptides. Cysteine at the N-terminal was important for both the reduction of chromium (pH 7.4) and the HO center dot activity because S-H bond energies at that position were lower based on DFT calculations.

AB Differences in the taste profile of corn puffed products formulated with refined versus whole grain mix flour were characterized. The perceived bitter intensity was reported to be the main taste difference between the samples. Based on multidimensional sensory-guided fractionation techniques and subsequent identification by MS and NMR analysis, the primary bitter compounds identified in the whole grain sample were L-tryptophan, chaenorpine, N-1,N-5-Di-[E]-p-coumaroyl-spermidine, and terrestribisamide. All compounds were reported to contribute to bitterness perception at the concentrations reported in the saliva after mastication of the extruded products; chaenorphine had the highest contribution to the perceived bitterness. All bitter compounds were endogenous products of the corn.

AB Fusarium rot of muskmelon, caused by Fusarium spp., is one of the most important postharvest decays, that not only causes economic losses but leads to trichothecenes contamination. A rapid and sensitive method was developed for neosolaniol (NEO) analysis in muskmelon inoculated with F. sulphureum, utilizing acetonitrile/water (84:16, v/v) extraction and PriboFast M270 columns purification and UPLC-MS/MS detection. Method validation was evaluated by linearity (R >= 0.9990), recovery (88.1-136.9%), precision (RSD <= 3.97%) and sensitivity (LOD, 0.5 mu g/kg; LOQ, 1.5 mu g/kg). The effect of ozone treatment on Fusarium rot development and NEO accumulation in inoculated muskmelon was also evaluated. The results showed that UPLC-MS/MS method was suitable for analyzing NEO in inoculated muskmelon, and 1.10 mg/l ozone treatment for 120 min significantly controlled Fusarium rot development and NEO accumulation in fruits after 5, 8 and 11 days. In vivo tests showed that ozone at 1.10 mg/l effectively degraded NEO in acetonitrile.

AB The objective of this study was to prove and explain the disease resistance-inducing ability of Cryptococcus laurentii on cherry tomato, as well as assay its effect on fruit quality. Apart from disease incidence, activities of defense-related enzymes and expression of critical genes were studied. With pre-treatment of C. laurentii, disease incidences of Botrytis cinerea and Alternaria alternate infected fruits were both significantly reduced. Corresponding mechanism could be explained as C. laurentii can induce resistance in cherry tomato by activating the expression of important defense-related genes, such as genes involved in salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways and genes encoding pathogenesis related proteins, thus activating comprehensive defense reaction against pathogen invasion. Coupled with the results that fruit color was improved and other physicochemical parameters remained uninfluenced, our study suggests that pre-treatment with C. laurentii can be a promising method to preserve cherry tomato fruits.

AB Chitosan is produced by thermochemical alkaline deacetylation of chitin, but the process is usually environmentally problematic. In the present study, Illex argentinus squid pen chitin, after de-proteinization and demineralization, was pretreated with a compressional-puffing (CP) process under various puffing pressures. The CP process facilitated the increase of the crystalline index and degree of deacetylation of chitins. The CP-treated chitins were subjected to further extraction of chitosan, and four chitosan isolates (CI1-CI4) were obtained. The CP process was found to have beneficial effects in terms of increased extraction yield and increased antibacterial activity of the extracted chitosans. Moreover, the antibacterial property of the extracted chitosans seemed to be negatively related to their molecular weight (MW). Our findings showed that CI4 exhibited the highest extraction yield and the greatest antibacterial activity, and thus we recommend it as a safe and potent antibacterial agent for food, biomedicine, and other industrial usages.

AB In this study, dark chocolate enriched with EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) was developed using various forms and origins. Quality characteristics such as physical, thermo-gravimetric, rheological, textural and sensory properties of chocolates were investigated. The highest EPA/DHA stability was determined in samples prepared by free-flowing powder and microencapsulated forms of omega-3 fatty acids (FA). The L* and C* values varied from 32.16-33.37 and 7.45-8.09, respectively for the all samples. Hardness values ranged between 6422 and 8367 N and the use of EPA/DHA in the triglyceride form caused softer chocolate whereas control sample was the hardest sample. Melting and rheological properties were not significantly affected by the studied EPA/DHA sources (P < 0.05). Microencapsulated EPA/DHA added chocolate was the most preferred source whereas sample with algae oil showed the lowest acceptability. According to the results, dark chocolate can be used for delivering omega-3 FA by considering their origin and physical form.

AB The nutritional value of cocoa butter is mainly determined by the composition of triacylglycerols (TAGs). In this paper we have developed a non-aqueous reversed-phase liquid chromatographic method, using ethanol as the mobile phase, coupled to electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry to identify TAGs in raw cocoa beans from six different origins. Tandem mass spectrometry was adopted to facilitate the identification of TAGs using unique diacylglycerol product ions and neutral losses. Additionally, two-dimensional m/z retention time maps aided the identification of entire homologous series of TAGs. A total of 83 different TAGs were identified in unfermented cocoa beans, 58 of which were not previously reported in cocoa. Thirty-one of these compounds represent a new class of TAGs characterized by the presence of one to three hydroxyl groups on the unsaturated fatty acid chain. To date, this represents the largest number of TAGs identified in cocoa.

AB Fish oil (FO) products constitute good sources of omega-3 fats. Oxidation data from a large third-party database of 1900 + globally-sourced FO samples were assessed. In FO products, for peroxide value (PV), 13.9% exceeded 5 mEq O-2/kg (2.2% > 10); for acid value (AcV) 2.1% exceeded 3 mg KOH/g, while for p-anisidine value (pAV) in unflavoured oils, 6.1% exceeded 20, (3.8% > 30), and 8.8% exceeded TOTOX limits (26). Additionally, we compared FO with other dietary oils. The FO median PV was similar to those of algal and sunflower oils, 4.8-fold greater than krill oil, and 5.2-fold less than extra-virgin olive oil. The median pAV differed non-significantly among oils. The FO median AcV was similar to those of algal and extra-virgin olive oils, 3.4-fold greater than sunflower oil, and 11.9-fold less than krill oil. This study has provided new insight that retail FO products predominantly meet regulatory guidelines and are comparable in oxidative status to other dietary oils.

AB The structure of neutral fraction gum from flaxseed mucilage (FM-NFG) was studied for better understanding of the relationship between primary structure and conformation. Based on methylation/GC-MS, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the structure of FM-NFG was proposed as arabinoxylans. Flaxseed mucilage arabinoxylans contained beta-1,4-linked xylose backbones, which were mainly substituted at O-2 and/or O-3 positions by 1-3 sugar residues. The possible branches included -> 5)-alpha-L-Araf-(1 -> (17.3 mol%), -> 3)-alpha-L-Araf-(1 -> (4.9 mol%), and -> 4)-alpha-D-Glcp-(1 -> (3.5 mol%), which were ended with three terminal sugar units: T-beta-D-Xylp-(1 -> (15.5 mol%), T-alpha-D-Glap-(1 -> (4.5 mol%), and T-alpha-L-Araf-(1 -> (2.6 mol%). The weight average molecular weight (Mw) of flaxseed mucilage arabinoxylans was calculated to be 1747 kDa by static light scattering (SLS), and it exhibited random coil conformation. The proposed structure and conformational models confirmed that different backbone sugar units especially substitution positions directly contributed to the conformational diversity and rigidity of polysaccharide molecules.

AB Grape, orange, peach and passion fruit nectars were formulated and adulterated by dilution with syrup, apple and cashew juices at 10 levels for each adulterant. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform mid infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra were obtained. Partial least squares (PLS) multivariate calibration models allied to different variable selection methods, such as interval partial least squares (iPLS), ordered predictors selection (OPS) and genetic algorithm (GA), were used to quantify the main fruits. PLS improved by iPLS-OPS variable selection showed the highest predictive capacity to quantify the main fruit contents. The selected variables in the final models varied from 72 to 100; the root mean square errors of prediction were estimated from 0.5 to 2.6%; the correlation coefficients of prediction ranged from 0.948 to 0.990; and, the mean relative errors of prediction varied from 3.0 to 6.7%. All of the developed models were validated.

AB A strict, lifelong gluten-free (GF) diet is currently the only treatment for coeliac disease (CD). Vinegar and soy sauce are fermented condiments that often include wheat and/or barley. During fermentation cereal proteins are partially degraded by enzymes to yield peptide fragments and amino acids. Whether these fermented products contain intact or degraded gluten proteins and if they are safe for people with CD remains in question. LC-MS offers the benefit of being able to detect hydrolysed gluten that might be present in commercial vinegar and soy sauce products. LC-MS revealed the presence of gluten in malt vinegar, wherein the identified peptides derived from B-, D-and gamma-hordein from barley, as well as gamma-gliadin, and HMW-and LMW-glutenins from wheat that are known to contain immunopathogenic epitopes. No gluten was detected in the soy sauces examined despite wheat being a labelled ingredient indicating extensive hydrolysis of gluten during soy sauce production.

AB Bresaola made from New Zealand mutton and lamb, were compared in quality attributes. Mutton bresaola had slightly lower protein and higher moisture contents, and similar amount of intramuscular fat and instrumental colour compared to that of the lamb. 36 and 80 unique endogenous peptides were observed in mutton and lamb, respectively. Proteolysis during dry-curing was affected by the age of the animal and has resulted in softer and easier to chew textural properties to the mutton bresaola. Significantly higher amounts of total free amino acids and higher proportion of essential amino acids were detected in the mutton bresaola from digestion simulation compared to that from lamb. Expedited proteolysis measured in the form of the release of free amino acids was positively related to the animal age. Overall, bresaola from mutton had more favourable characteristics compared to that of the lamb.

AB This study represents a large-scale investigation into iodine contents in three commercially important and edible seaweed species from the North Atlantic: the brown algae Saccharina latissima and Alaria esculenta, and the red alga Palmaria palmata. Variability among and within species were explored in terms of temporal and spatial variations in addition to biomass source. Mean iodine concentration in bulk seaweed biomass was species-specific: Saccharina > Alaria > Palmaria. Iodine contents of Saccharina biomass were similar between years and seasons, but varied significantly between sampling locations and biomass sources. In Alaria and Palmaria, none of the independent variables examined contributed significantly to the small variations observed. Our data suggest that all three species are rich sources of iodine, and only 32, 283, or 2149 mg dry weight of unprocessed dry biomass of Saccharina, Alaria, or Palmaria, respectively, meets the recommended daily intake levels for most healthy humans.

AB Heat-induced color changes of crustaceans are commonly described as the release of astaxanthin. In this study on Crangon crangon, it was found that astaxanthin plays a minor role in the (dis) coloration. By LC-HRMS, two polar, process dependent pigments were found. One pigment was identified as riboflavin and one as drosopterin (level-2 certainty). Thermal treatments had highest effect on drosopterin concentration changes and were chosen as indicator for a kinetic study of heat-induced color changes. The kinetic data fitted a consecutive step model (r(2) = 0.971), including a first step in which drosopterin was released (k(d,85 degrees C) = 0.95 +/- 0.09 min(-1); Ea(d) = 105 +/- 4 kJ/mol) and a second step where drosopterin is degraded (k(b,85 degrees C) = 0.02 +/- 0.002 min(-1); Ea(b) = 190 +/- 15 kJ/mol). The kinetic model shows that shrimp should be heated at lower temperatures (< 80 degrees C) than the heating temperatures used by fishermen (86-101 degrees C), creating opportunities for quality optimization. Therefore, this study delivers essential information needed in a comprehensive quality optimization study of the cooked brown shrimp.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo anticancer efficacy of redox-responsive microbeads containing thiolated pectin-doxorubicin (DOX) conjugate. Oral microbeads were coated with an enteric polymer to protect the drug from release in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract and allow redoxtriggered drug release in the colon. Morphology, particle size, drug content, and in vitro drug release behavior of the microbeads were characterized; in vitro cytotoxicity was tested on mouse colon carcinoma, human colorectal adenocarcinoma, and human bone osteosarcoma cell lines. In vivo anticancer efficacy of coated microbeads was examined in BALB/c mice with murine colon carcinoma. These coated microbeads significantly inhibited the growth of all cell lines. The in vivo study confirmed delivery of DOX to the colorectal tumor site, redox-responsiveness, and anticancer efficacy of coated microbeads. Coated microbeads also effectively inhibited primary tumor growth and suppressed tumor metastases without gross toxicity to the non-target tissue. No noticeable damage was found in mouse GI tissues, indicating lack of DOX toxicity.

AB Pregabalin is a promising drug for the treatment of neuropathic pain, a chronic disease affecting a large population needing long-term treatment. However, due to its short half-life, the commercial tablet has to be administered 2-3 times per day, with inconvenience for patient and fluctuations of plasma concentration. In this study, a gastro-floating drug delivery system of pregabalin was developed to prolong the gastric retention of drugs absorbed or act in stomach or upper gastrointestinal tract. First of all, it was proved that the drug was mainly absorbed in stomach and upper gastrointestinal tract. The final formulation was optimized in consideration of buoyancy and drug release profile. The gastro-floating tablet was prepared with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) as sustained-release matrix, lipophilic cetyl alcohol as floating-assistance agent and other excipients to achieve satisfying buoyancy and sustained release performance with mechanisms of diffusion and matrix erosion. Food exhibited significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of gastro-floating tablet and conventional capsule. Compared with conventional capsules, the relative bioavailability of gastro-floating tablet in fasted conditions or in fed conditions was only 62.47 +/- 10.80% and 100.98 +/- 17.25% respectively, even though the gastro-floating tablet obtained decreased C-max and prolonged T-max in fasted and fed conditions. Besides, good in vivo-in vitro correlation of the gastro-floating tablet was established. In summary, a gastrofloating tablet of pregabalin exhibiting desired buoyancy and release profiles was designed, and the tablet expressed significantly sustained-release behavior in fed conditions with good in vivo-in vitro correlation. The designed gastro-floating system is a promising choice for the patients to relieve neuropathic pain.

AB This study explores the methodology advised by healthcare professionals and the methods used by parents/carers to identify whether there is a best practice method for manipulation of 10 mg hydrocortisone tablets to provide an accurate dose to children. Bespoke surveys were used to identify methods recommended and used in manipulation of tablets. Hydrocortisone tablets were manipulated to provide a specified dose by both naive participants and parents/carers. The accuracy of manipulation was assessed using HPLC analysis. Competed surveys were received from 159 parent/carers reporting doses that ranged from 0.25 to 15 mg. Parents/carers most commonly reported splitting the tablet and administering the solid fraction; however more than 30% of those reporting physically splitting tablets were preparing doses that were not simply halving or quartering tablets. In a naive population the dose accuracy, defined as percent of doses within 20% of the theoretical dose ranged from 57 to 58% depending on the tablet brand and the method of manipulation used. Almost threequarters (74.1%) of parent/carers (n= 27) were able to produce a dose within 20% of the theoretical value and the most accurate method was to split tablets and administer the solid fraction. This study shows that a lack of age-appropriate medicines results in children being at risk of sub-optimal dosing.

AB In this study, we developed a peptide-dendrimer-drug conjugate system for the pH-triggered direct cytosolic delivery of the cancer chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (DOX) using the pH Low Insertion Peptide (pHLIP). We synthesized a pHLIP-dendrimer-DOX conjugate in which a single copy of pHLIP displayed a generation three dendrimer bearing multiple copies of DOX via disulfide linkages. Biophysical analysis showed that both the dendrimer and a single DOX conjugate inserted into membrane bilayers in a pH-dependent manner. Time-resolved confocal microscopy indicate the single DOX conjugate may undergo a faster rate of membrane translocation, due to greater nuclear localization of DOX at 24 h and 48 h post delivery. At 72 h, however, the levels of DOX nuclear accumulation for both constructs were identical. Cytotoxicity assays revealed that both constructs mediated similar to 80% inhibition of cellular proliferation at 10 mu M, the dendrimer complex exhibited a 17% greater cytotoxic effect at lower concentrations and greater than three-fold improvement in IC50 over free DOX. Our findings show proof of concept that the dendrimeric display of DOX on the pHLIP carrier (1) facilitates the pH-dependent and temporally-controlled release of DOX to the cytosol, (2) eliminates the endosomal sequestration of the drug cargo, and (3) augments DOX cytotoxicity relative to the free drug.

AB This study aims to design a novel nano-sized anticancer drug delivery system that can enhance the therapeutic effects of the loaded drug. With this idea in mind, this work reported the design and characterization of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) functionalized chitin (CH) derivative, and its application in nano-drug delivery system. The EGCG-functionalized CH (CE) polymer was firstly prepared and characterized. The nanoparticles (NPs) of CE-loaded honokiol (HK), which was prepared by ionic crosslinking, exhibited a size of 80 nm, zeta potential of + 33.8 mV, and spherical morphology. The antitumor activity of the CE-HK NPs in vitro and in vivo was investigated and compared to free HK. As a result, the CE-HK NPs can effectively inhibited cell proliferation of HepG2 cell by inhibiting more cells in the G2/M phase and decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential. The CE-HK NPs (40 mg/kg) inhibited tumor growth by 83.55% (p < 0.05), which was far higher than the 30.15% inhibition of free HK (40 mg/kg). The proposed delivery system exhibits better tumor selectivity and growth reduction both in vitro and in vivo, and does not induce any side effects. Therefore, the CE-HK NPs may act as an effective delivery system of liver cancer agent HK.

AB Glioblastoma multiforme is the most lethal type of brain tumor and the established therapy only extends patients survival to approximately one year. Its first-line treatment is based on of chemotherapy with the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ). As many other chemotherapeutic drugs, TMZ presents several limitations as high toxicity and low bioavailability. The delivery of TMZ using poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles is proposed in this work. Stable nanoparticles functionalized with a OX26 type monoclonal antibody for transferrin receptor were developed, targeting the glioblastoma tumor cells, since these cells are known for overexpressing this receptor. The release profile of TMZ from the nanoparticles was studied mimicking physiological conditions, and targeted cellular internalization was also investigated. Two glioblastoma cell lines - U215 and U87 - were used to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity of the drug, showing that the prepared nanocarriers enhance the anticancer activity of TMZ. The functionalization with the monoclonal antibody for transferrin receptor proved to be advantageous in enhancing the cellular internalization in glioblastoma cells.

AB The principles of bioorthogonal click chemistry and metabolic glycoengineering were applied to produce targeted anti-cancer drug delivery via fattigation-platform-based gelatin-oleic nanoparticles. A sialic acid precursor (Ac4ManNAz) was introduced to the cell surface. Gelatin and oleic acid were conjugated by 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3- ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS) chemistry with the subsequent covalent attachment of dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) in a click reaction on the cell surface. The physicochemical properties, drug release, in vitro cytotoxicity, and cellular uptake of DBCO-conjugated gelatin oleic nanoparticles (GON-DBCO; particle size, similar to 240 nm; zeta potential, 6 mV) were evaluated. Doxorubicin (DOX) was used as a model drug and compared with the reference product, Caelyx (R). A549 and MCF-7 cell lines were used for the in vitro studies. GON-DBCO showed high DOX loading and encapsulation efficiencies. In A549 cells, the IC50 value for GON-DBCO-DOX (1.29 mu g/ml) was six times lower than that of Caelyx (R) (10.54 mu g/ml); in MCF-7 cells, the IC50 values were 1.78 mu g/ml and 2.84 mu g/ml, respectively. Confocal microscopy confirmed the click reaction between GON-DBCO and Ac4ManNAz on the cell surface. Flow cytometry data revealed that the intracellular uptake of GON-DBCO-DOX was approximately two times greater than that of GON-DOX and Caelyx (R). Thus, the newly designed GON-DBCO-DOX provided a safe and efficient drug delivery system to actively target the anticancer agents.

AB As one of the classical nano drug carriers, chitosan-based nanoparticles (CsNps) are getting increasing attentions for their non-toxicity, biocompatibility and biodegradability. The ionotropic gelation is the most favorable method for CsNps preparation, while it's beset by some issues, i.e. low particle formation yield, poor physical stability and low hydrophobic drug loading capacity. To solve these problems, a simple desolvation method was attempted in this study for CsNps preparation. Using this method, an increased formation yield of CsNps (about 100%) could be obtained, and after diluting the particles by various buffers (PBS 7.0, 7.4 and 8.0, DMEM medium and 1640 medium), an improved stability in diameter could be observed. The drug loading results showed paclitaxel loading efficiency of 9.8% could be obtained when the ratio of paclitaxel to Cs was set at 0.2, higher than the ionotropic gelation method (0.43%). The particles formation mechanisms were studied by the molecular dynamics simulation, and the results showed the Lennard-Jones interaction of Cs-Cs, which could be adjusted by the pH value of system, played a great role in formation of particles with the desolvation method. This study provided an alternative preparation technology for CsNps with high process yield, physical stability and hydrophobic drug encapsulation capacity.

AB Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is the most commonly investigated 3D printing technology for the manufacture of personalized medicines, however, the high temperatures used in the process limit its wider application. The objective of this study was to print low-melting and thermolabile drugs by reducing the FDM printing temperature. Two immediate release polymers, Kollidon VA64 and Kollidon 12PF were investigated as potential candidates for low-temperature FDM printing. Ramipril was used as the model low melting temperature drug (109 degrees C); to the authors' knowledge this is the lowest melting point drug investigated to date by FDM printing. Filaments loaded with 3% drug were obtained by hot melt extrusion at 70 degrees C and ramipril printlets with a dose equivalent of 8.8 mg were printed at 90 degrees C. HPLC analysis confirmed that the drug was stable with no signs of degradation and dissolution studies revealed that drug release from the printlets reached 100% within 20-30 min. Variable temperature Raman and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy techniques were used to evaluate drug stability over the processing temperature range. These data indicated that ramipril did not undergo degradation below its melting point (which is above the processing temperature range: 70-90 degrees C) but it was transformed into the impurity diketopiperazine upon exposure to temperatures higher than its melting point. The use of the excipients Kollidon VA64 and Kollidon 12PF in FDM was further validated by printing with the drug 4-aminosalicylic acid (4-ASA), which in previous work was reported to undergo degradation in FDM printing, but here it was found to be stable. This work demonstrates that the selection and use of new excipients can overcome one of the major disadvantages in FDM printing, drug degradation due to thermal heating, making this technology suitable for drugs with lower melting temperatures.

AB Stable continuous micro-feeding of fine cohesive powders has recently gained importance in many fields. However, it remains a great challenge in practice because of the powder aggregate caused by interparticle cohesive forces in small capillaries. This paper describes a novel method of feeding fine cohesive powder actuated by a pulse inertia force and acoustic radiation force simultaneously in an ultrasonic standing wave field using a tapered glass nozzle. Nozzles with different outlet diameters are fabricated using glass via a heating process. A pulse inertia force is excited to drive powder movement to the outlet section of the nozzle in a consolidated columnar rod mode. An acoustic radiation force is generated to suspend the particles and make the rod break into large quantities of small agglomerates which impact each other randomly. So the aggregation phenomenon in the fluidization of cohesive powders can be eliminated. The suspended powder is discharged continuously from the nozzle orifice owing to the self-gravities and collisions between the inner particles. The micro-feeding rates can be controlled accurately and the minimum values for RespitoseSV003 and Granulac230 are 0.4 mg/s and 0.5 mg/s respectively. The relative standard deviations of all data points are below 0.12, which is considerably smaller than those of existing vibration feeders with small capillaries.

AB Orodispersible film (ODF) is a widely used oral solid dosage form. However, it's not suitable for drugs with short half-life, bitterness and strong hygroscopicity. The present study aims to develop a sustained release and stable betahistine hydrochloride ODF without bitterness. Drug-resin complex (IRDC) was prepared using batch method. In vitro dissolution experiment, e-Tongue and hygroscopicity experiment were conducted to compare the differences between ODF containing IRDC and ODF containing betahistine hydrochloride. Drug release kinetics showed that the diffusion of drug in IRDC was the rate-limiting step of drug release. DSC and FT-IR were conducted to explore the molecular mechanism of taste masking and hygroscopicity reduction. It turned out that taste masking was attributed to the ionic interaction between drug and resin and the slow dissolution of drug from IRDC. The site where drug form hydrogen bonds with water molecular was occupied by drug-resin interaction leading to hygroscopicity reduction. In summary, in this study we not only developed a betahistine hydrochloride ODF with good properties but also explored the effect of drug-resin interaction on sustained release, taste masking and hygroscopicity reduction.

ID PSEUDOMONAS-AERUGINOSA; PHAGE THERAPY
AB Microfluidics has recently emerged as a new method of manufacturing liposomes, which allows reproducible mixing in miliseconds on the nanoliter scale. Here we investigated the feasibility of a microfluidic flow focusing setup built from commercially available fittings to encapsulate phages into liposomes. Two types of Pseudomonas phages, PEV2 (Podovirus, similar to 65 nm) and PEV40 (Myovirus, similar to 220 nm), were used as model phages. A mixture of soy phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol at a ratio of 4: 1 dissolved in absolute ethanol with a total solid content of 17.5 mg/mL was injected through the center inlet channel of a cross mixer. Phage suspensions were injected into the cross mixer from the two side channels intersecting with the center channel. The total flow rate (TFR) varied 160-320 mu L/min and the organic/aqueous flow rate ratio (FRR) varied 1:3-2:3. The size of liposomes and the encapsulation efficiency both increased with increasing FRR and slightly decreased with increasing TFR. Due to the different size of the two studied phages, the size of liposomes encapsulating PEV2 were smaller (135-218 nm) than those encapsulating the Myovirus PEV40 (261-448 nm). Highest encapsulation efficiency of PEV2 (59%) and PEV40 (50%) was achieved at a TFR of 160 mu L/ml and a FRR of 2:3. Generally, the encapsulation efficiency was slightly higher than that obtained from the conventional thin film hydration followed by extrusion method. In summary, the proposed microfluidic technique was capable of encapsulating phages of different size into liposomes with reasonable encapsulation efficiency and minimal titer reduction.

AB Psoriasis is a widespread chronic disease affecting 2-4% of the population in Western countries. Its mild-to-moderate form, representing approximately 80% of the total cases, is treated by topical application, with corticosteroid being the standard treatment. However, in case of psoriasis, no single treatment works for every patient and optimizing topical therapy is a key aspect. A possible alternative is represented by cyclosporine, an immunosuppressant cyclic peptide administered orally in the treatment of the severe form. Its topical application could avoid the problems related to systemic immunosuppression, but the unfavourable physico-chemical properties (MW: 1202 Da; LogP approximate to 3) hinder its permeation across the stratum corneum. The aim of the paper was the preparation, characterization and ex-vivo evaluation of cyclosporine loaded microemulsions using oleic acid as oil phase, either Tween (R) 80 or a soluble derivative of vitamin E (TPGS) as surfactants and either Transcutol (R), propylene glycol or 1,3 propanediol as co-surfactants. The issue of formulation viscosity was also addressed 1) by evaluating the thickening of Tween (R) 80-based microemulsions by direct addition of different rheological modifiers, 2) by building pseudo-ternary phase diagrams using TPGS, to identify the water/oil/surfactants proportions resulting in viscous self-gelifying systems. Nine formulations (five Tween (R) 80-based and four TPGS-based) were selected, characterized in terms of droplets size (low viscosity systems) or rheological properties (high viscosity systems), loaded with 6 mg/g cyclosporine and applied ex-vivo on porcine skin for 22 h. A relevant skin accumulation was obtained either with a low-viscosity Tween (R) 80-based microemulsion (9.78 +/- 3.86 mu g/cm(2)), or with a high viscosity TPGS-based microemulsion (18.3 +/- 5.69 mu g/cm(2)), with an increase of about 3 and 6 times respectively for comparison with a control cyclosporine solution in propylene glycol. The role of water content, surfactant, co-surfactant and viscosity was also addressed and discussed. The kinetic of skin uptake from the best performing formulation was finally evaluated, highlighting a relatively quick skin uptake and the achievement, after 2 h of contact, of potentially therapeutic cyclosporine skin concentrations.

AB The use of gelatin has been gaining recognition in ocular delivery for its safety profile and biocompatible properties. Timolol Maleate (TM) is an anti-glaucoma drug possessing poor corneal penetration while causing eye irritation making it an ideal candidate for novel nanoparticulate systems. Timolol Maleate loaded Gelatin Nanoparticles (GNPs) were prepared using the double desolvation method utilizing glutaraldehyde as the crosslinking agent. Optimization of the nanoparticles was achieved through a full-factorial design. An optimum formulation possessing particle size of 205 nm, zetapotential of 12.5 mV and an entrapment efficiency of 74.72% was selected. TEM imaging of the optimized nanoparticles was performed and the stability was tracked over 6 months. The in-vitro release studies showed a burst effect followed by a sustained profile. The selected formulae were tested in-vivo and compared to a Timolol marketed product on albino rabbits and were proven superior regarding intraocular pressure lowering and sustained efficacy. The prepared nanoparticles successfully passed Draize irritancy test and showed normal histology. These data indicate that the prepared GNPs possessed all needed qualities of a successful ocular system; corneal affinity, suitable particle size, high entrapment efficiency, sustained release, good stability, efficient lowering of intraocular pressure, high drug bioavailability and lack of irritancy.

AB A10, (3-phenylacetylamino-2,6-piperidinedione), is a natural peptide with broad antineoplastic activity. Recently, in vitro antitumor effect of a new A10 analog [3-(4-methoxybenzoylamino)-2,6-piperidinedione] (MPD) has been verified. However, poor aqueous solubility represents an obstacle towards intravenous formulation of MPD and impedes successful in vivo antitumor activity. To surmount such limitation, MPD microemulsion (MPDME) was developed. A 3(1)2(2) full factorial design using Design-Expert (R) software was adopted to study the influence of different parameters and select the optimum formulation (MPDME1). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) displayed spherical droplets of MPDME1. The cytotoxicity of MPDME1 in Michigan Cancer Foundation 7 (MCF-7) breast cancer cell line exceeded that of MPD solution (MPDS) and tamoxifen. Compatibility with injectable diluents, in vitro hemolytic studies and in vivo histopathological examination confirmed the safety of parenteral application of MPDME1. Molecular docking results showed almost same binding affinity of A10, MPD and I-125-MPD with histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) receptor. Accordingly, radio-iodination of MPDME1 and MPDS was done via direct electrophilic substitution reaction. Biodistribution of (125)IMPDME1 and I-125-MPDS in normal and tumor (ascites and solid) bearing mice showed high accumulation of I-125-MPDME1 in tumor tissues. Overall, the results proved that MPDME represents promising parenteral delivery system capable of improving antineoplastic activity of MPD.

AB Oral delivery of vaccines is highly desirable, yet it has met with limited success. Previously we developed allergen-free pollen grains as a novel approach for oral vaccination. We showed that spores of Lycopodium clavatum can be used for oral vaccination. However, it is unknown if pollens of other species can be similarly used as an oral vaccine carrier. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated common ragweed (RW) pollen (Ambrosia elatior) for its oral vaccination potential. Allergen-free RW pollens were prepared from natural pollens through chemical treatment. Eight weekly oral doses of ovalbumin (OVA) formulated with treated RW generated strong systemic (anti-OVA IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgA) and mucosal (anti-OVA IgA) immune responses that sustained for at least three months after vaccination. Mucosal IgA against OVA was found in the lung lavage, feces, saliva, and vaginal secretion. Moreover, three and half months after the last immunization OVA-specific plasma cells were found in the bone marrow that actively secreted IgG and IgG1 antibodies. No IgE against RW-specific proteins was detected in the serum. Overall, RW pollen demonstrated potential for oral vaccine delivery.

AB This study aimed to develop a novel type of multilayer micelle using protamine (PRM) and hyaluronic acid (HA) for the delivery of gambogic acid (GA). GA-loaded micelles (GA-M) were simply and rapidly prepared using lecithin/solutol HS15 using a film-dispersion method. PRM and HA were added in sequence to form layer-bylayer self-assembled micelles (HA-PRM-GA-M), in which particle size, zeta potential, particle morphology, drug loading, encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro release were investigated. Surface charge reversal demonstrated that rapid HA detachment exposed PRM, leading to activation of a "proton sponge" effect in the hyaluronidase (HAase)-rich tumor microenvironment. Compared with coumarin 6-loaded micelles (C6-M), more efficient intracellular trafficking was observed for HA-PRM-C6-M, which is associated with the endosomal/lysosomal escaping ability of the exposed PRM. In vivo imaging showed increased enrichment of near infrared fluorescent dye (DIR)-loaded HA-PRM-DIR-M at the tumor site, suggesting that HA enhanced the active tumor targeting of GA. Furthermore, HA-PRM-GA-M showed the stronger antitumor activity than GA and GA-M against human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) tumor xenografts in nude mice. In summary, our findings show the potential of HAPRM- GA-M as a novel intravenous drug carrier for the treatment of lung cancer.

AB Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) possesses a set of valuable biological properties: antioxidant, antibacterial, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, etc. However, CAPE is poorly soluble in aqueous environment which is limiting its possible therapeutic applications. In the present study novel fibrous materials enhancing CAPE solubility and accelerating CAPE release were developed. The materials were prepared from poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) by electrospinning and by electrospinning combined with dip-coating. The effects of the composition - without/with addition of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and of the design of fiber (CAPE in the bulk of the fiber or incorporated in the PVP coating) on some of the properties of these materials were studied. X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry analyses revealed that CAPE was in the amorphous state in CAPE-loaded fibers and in the PVP coating. The new CAPE-containing materials exhibited good antioxidant activity. The microbiological screening demonstrated that incorporation of CAPE in the fibers or in the coating induced complete killing of Gram-positive S. aureus and led to inhibition of the growth of Gram-negative E. coli by the fibrous materials. Moreover, pathogenic S. aureus did not adhere onto CAPE-containing fibrous mats. Therefore, the obtained materials are promising candidates for use as wound dressing materials.

AB This project aims to study the nature of interaction and orientation of selected drugs such as dexamethorphan HBr (DXM), diphenhydramine HCl (DPH), and lidocaine HCl (LDC) inclusion complexes with hydroxyl-propyl beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) using (HNMR)-H-1 spectroscopy, 2D-NMR ROESY and molecular-modeling techniques. Freeze-drying technique was used to formulate the inclusion complexes between DXM, DPH and LDC with HP-beta-CD (1: 1M ratio) in solid state. Inclusion complex formation was initially characterized by Fourier transforminfrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. Further characterization of inclusion complexes to determine the interaction of DXM, DPH and LDC with HP-beta-CD was performed using the (HNMR)-H-1 spectroscopy, 2D-NMR ROESY and molecular modeling techniques. Inclusion complexes of DXM, DPH and LDC with HP-beta-CD were successfully prepared using the freeze-drying technique. Preliminary studies with FT-IR, DSC, XRD and SEM indicated the formation of inclusion complexes of DXM, DPH and LDC with HP-beta-CD at 1: 1M ratio. (HNMR)-H-1 study showed a change in proton chemical shift upon complexation. 2D-NMR ROESY (two-dimensional) spectroscopy gave an insight into the spatial arrangement between the host and guest atoms. 2D-ROESY experiments further predicted the direction of orientation of guest molecules, indicating the probability that amino moieties of DXM, DPH and LDC are inside the hydrophobic HP-beta-CD cavity. Cross-peaks of inclusion complexes demonstrated intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) between the amino protons in DXM, DPH and LDC and H-atoms of HP-beta-CD. Molecular modeling studies further confirmed the NMR data, providing a structural basis of the individual complex formations. Microsecond time-level molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations indicate much stronger binding of DXM to HP-beta-CD and more dynamic behavior for DPH and LDC. In particular, LDC can exhibit multiple binding modes, and even spent some time (similar to 1-2%) out of the carrier, proving the dynamic nature of the complex. To conclude, 2D-NMR and molecular dynamic simulations elucidate the formation of inclusion complexes and intermolecular interactions of DXM, DPH and LDC with HP-beta-CD.

AB Polysaccharides-based delivery systems and interpolyelectrolyte complexes (IPECs) are interesting alternatives to control the release of drugs, thereby improving therapies. Benznidazole (BZ) is the selected drug for Chagas disease pharmacotherapy. However, its side effects limit its efficacy and safety. We developed novel multi-particulated BZ-loaded IPECs based on chitosan and alginic acid, and investigated their physicochemical and pharmacotechnical properties. IPECs were obtained using the casting solvent method, followed by wet granulation. They presented ionic interaction between the biopolymers, revealed that free BZ was uniformly distributed and showed adequate flow properties for hard gelatin-capsule formulation. The multiparticles exhibited mucoadhesion properties and revealed modulation of BZ release, depending on the release media, in accordance with the fluid uptake. The IPECs developed possess interesting properties that are promising for the design of novel alternatives to improve Chagas disease pharmacotherapy, which would diminish BZ's adverse effects and/or allow a reduction in the frequency of BZ administration.

AB The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the influence of liposome formulation on the ability of vesicles to penetrate a pathological mucus model obtained from COPD affected patients in order to assess the potential of such vesicles for the treatment of chronic respiratory diseases by inhalation. Therefore, Small Unilamellar Liposomes (PLAIN-LIPOSOMEs), Pluronic (R) F127-surface modified liposomes (PF-LIPOSOMEs) and PEG 2000PE-surface modified liposomes (PEG-LIPOSOMEs) were prepared using the micelle-to-vesicle transition (MVT) method and beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) as model drug. The obtained liposomes showed diameters in the range of 40-65 nm, PDI values between 0.25 and 0.30 and surface electric charge essentially close to zero. The encapsulation efficiency was found to be dependent on the BDP/lipid ratio used and, furthermore, BDP-loaded liposomes were stable in size both at 37 degrees C and at 4 degrees C. All liposomes were not cytotoxic on H441 cell line as assessed by the MTT assay. The liposome uptake was evaluated through a cytofluorimetric assay that showed a non-significant reduction in the internalization of PEG-LIPOSOMEs as compared with PLAIN-LIPOSOMEs. The penetration studies of mucus from COPD patients showed that the PEG-LIPOSOMEs were the most mucus-penetrating vesicles after 27 h. In addition, PEG-and PF-LIPOSOMEs did not cause any effect on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid proteins after aerosol administration in the mouse. The results highlight that PEG-LIPOSOMEs show the most interesting features in terms of penetration through the pathologic sputum, uptake by airway epithelial cells and safety profile.

AB The transport pathways and permeation kinetics of lipophilic and hydrophilic fluorescent dyes through porcine mammary papillae were visualized and quantified. Porcine mammary papillae, removed from full-thickness abdominal tissue, were positioned in a Franz diffusion cell for passive diffusion studies. Solutions containing the fluorescent dyes were applied topically for time periods ranging from 30 min to 48 h. Dye concentrations in tissue and Franz diffusion compartments were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy and fluorimetry. Fluorescence micrographs elucidated two permeation pathways, transepidermal and transductal. Hydrophilic sulforhodamine B predominantly penetrated via the transepidermal route, while lipophilic nile red diffused mainly by the transductal route. An almost 4-fold higher amount of sulforhodamine B was retained within the nipple over time compared to nile red, despite both dyes permeating through the tissue at similar rates. Diffusion through the porcine nipple was 500-fold higher than through adjacent skin for both dyes, likely attributable to the two mammary ducts which provide an entry point and transport route through the tissue. These results, generated from both qualitative and quantitative evidence at a micro and macro scale, demonstrate that the mammary ducts provide a direct pathway that contributes significantly to passive transport through the nipple, particularly for lipophilic molecules.

AB The present study aimed to clarify the applicability of a self-micellizing solid dispersion of tranilast (SMSD/TL) to the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) using an experimental colitis model. SMSD/TL with several loading amounts ranging from 10 to 50% was prepared using a wet-milling system. The physicochemical properties of SMSD/TL were evaluated in terms of the dissolution behavior, morphology, and particle size distribution. Animal studies were conducted to evaluate oral bioavailability in rats and anti-inflammatory effects in a rat model of chemically induced colitis. SMSD/TL with drug loading of 15% (SMSD/TL15) showed enhanced dissolution behavior at pH 1.2, compared with other tested other formulations. After the dispersion of SMSD/TL15 in deionized water, fine micelles formed with an average diameter of 137 nm. SMSD/TL15 (10 mg-TL/kg) exhibited about 147-and 34-fold greater value for Cmax and the area under the curve of plasma concentration vs. time than crystalline TL, respectively. Although the anti-inflammatory effect on the colitis model was very limited in the crystalline TL (2 mg/kg) group, inflammatory events, such as myeloperoxidase activity and thickening of the submucosa in colon tissues, were significantly suppressed in the SMSD/TL15 (2 mg-TL/kg) group. Based on these findings, SMSD/TL might be a more efficacious dosage option for improved IBD treatment.

AB The display of N-acetylgalactosamine (NAcGal) ligands has shown great potential in improving the targeting of various therapeutic molecules to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a severe disease whose clinical treatment is severely hindered by limitations in delivery of therapeutic cargo. We previously used the display of NAcGal on generation 5 (G5) polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers connected through a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) brush (i.e. G5-cPEG-NAcGal; monoGal) to effectively target hepatic cancer cells and deliver a loaded therapeutic cargo. In this study, we were interested to see if tri-valent NAcGal ligands (i.e. NAcGal(3)) displayed on G5 dendrimers (i.e. G5-cPEG-NAcGal(3); triGal) could improve their ability to target hepatic cancer cells compared to their monoGal counterparts. We therefore synthesized a library of triGal particles, with either 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, or 14 targeting branches (i.e. cPEG-NAcGal(3)) attached. Conventional flow cytometry studies showed that all particle formulations can label hepatic cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner, reaching 90-100% of cells labeled at either 285 or 570 nM G5, but interestingly, monoGal labeled more cells at lower concentrations. To elucidate the difference in internalization of monoGal versus triGal conjugates, we turned to multi-spectral imaging flow cytometry and quantified the amount of internalized (I) versus surface-bound (I-0) conjugates to determine the ratio of internalization (I/I-0) in all treatment groups. Results show that regardless of NAcGal valency, or the density of targeting branches, all particles achieve full internalization and diffuse localization throughout the cell (I/I-0 similar to 3.0 for all particle compositions). This indicates that while tri-valent NAcGal is a promising technique for targeting nanoparticles to hepatic cancer cells, mono-valent NAcGal is more efficient, contrary to what is observed with small molecules.

AB Dissolution testing for inhalers were previously conducted either on unfractionated drug-carrier powders or drug of specific aerodynamic particle size. In this study, the collection of the full fine particle fraction (FPF) was attempted on a single stage. Capsules containing 30 mg of 2% salbutamol sulfate (SS) was tested to have a FPF of 9 +/- 1% using the full set of Andersen cascade impactor (ACI) and a modified Rotahaler (R) capable of achieving 4.0 kPa pressure drop at 60 L/min air flow rate. A truncated ACI comprising the USP throat, pre-separator, stage 0, stage 4, stage F, polytetrafluoroethylene funnel (TF) and small collection plate (sCP) was found to be capable of achieving a FPF of 9% collected on TF and sCP. An adhesive tape was used to collect the FPF from the TF and sCP and held in place by an enhancer cell in a 200 mL round bottom vessel containing 50 mL Gamble's solution with 0.2 v/v, % Tween 80. Dissolution testing of SS and Seretide (R) showed burst release of SS and salmeterol while sustained release of fluticasone. This study demonstrated a reproducible method which may be used for evaluation of the full FPF of orally inhaled products.

AB As crystalline indomethacin is heated and subsequently cooled, it transforms into glassy indomethacin. While the original crystals are off-white in color, the glass becomes blackish-brown via a yellow intermediate stage. TLC of the components of the glass revealed three bands. The yellow component, which is generated either under hypoxic conditions or in the dark, was elucidated by NMR spectroscopy to be a decarboxylated fragment produced by thermal degradation. The colorless component is proposed to be formed by the opening of the indole ring of indomethacin; the structure of this degradation product was identified by EI-MS to be the same as the oxidative-cleavage product formed upon UV-irradiation, as previously reported. Another band was a blackishbrown pigment whose mobility placed it close to the TLC baseline. This oxidative-cleavage product and the blackish-brown pigment are not generated under hypoxic conditions. However, the extent of indomethacin decarboxylation under hypoxic conditions was found to be dependent on the heating temperature and time. Consequently, we prepared amorphous indomethacin through control of the heating temperature and time; heating at 160 degrees C for 30 min or less under hypoxic conditions is optimum for obtaining pure amorphous indomethacin.

AB The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin labeling methodology was used to analyze the interactions of phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomal formulations that are commonly used as transepidermal drug delivery systems with stratum corneum (SC) membranes. The lipid dynamics of five liposome formulations were evaluated to study the influences of sorbitan monooleate (Span80), cholesterol, and cholesterol with the charged lipids 2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (DSPG) on the molecular dynamics of PC vesicles. The EPR spectra of 5-doxyl-stearic acid (5-DSA) showed that the addition of Span80 to the liposomes increased the lipid fluidity, whereas cholesterol had the opposite effect, and the combination of charged lipids and cholesterol did not additionally influence the lipid bilayer dynamics. Fatty acid spin-labeled SC membranes were treated with the liposome formulations, leading to migration of the spin label to the molecular environment of the formulation and the presence of two spectral components representing distinct mobility states. In terms of molecular dynamics, these environments correspond to the lipid domains of the untreated SC and the liposome, indicating a poor interaction between the liposome and SC membranes. However, the contact was sufficient to allow a pronounced exchange of the spin-labeled fatty acid. Our data suggest that flexible liposomes may access the inner intercellular membranes of the SC and facilitate mutual lipid exchange without losing their relative liposomal integrity.

AB N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) commonly used as an antidote in acetaminophen poisoning has shown promise in the treatment of neurological disorders such as cerebral palsy (CP). However, NAC suffers from drawbacks such as poor oral bioavailability and suboptimal blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability limiting its clinical success. It was previously demonstrated that intravenous administration of dendrimer-NAC (D-NAC) conjugates have shown significant promise in the targeted treatment of neuroinflammation, in multiple preclinical models. Development of an oral formulation of D-NAC may open new administrative routes for this compound. Here, we report the gastrointestinal stability, in vitro transepithelial permeability, and in vivo oral absorption and pharmacokinetics in rats of a pediatric formulation of D-NAC containing Capmul MCM (glycerol monocaprylate) as a penetration enhancer. D-NAC was stable for 6 h in all five simulated gastrointestinal fluids with no signs of chemical degradation. The apparent permeability (P-app) of D-NAC increased 9-fold in the formulation containing Capmul. The area under the curve [AUC](0-infinity) of D-NAC with Capmul increased by 47% when compared to D-NAC alone. These results indicate that an oral pediatric formulation containing D-NAC and Capmul can be an effective option for the treatment of neuroinflammation.

AB The overall objective of this work is to understand how excipient characteristics influence the drug product quality attributes and process performance of a continuous twin screw wet granulation process. The knowledge gained in this study is intended to be used for Quality by Design (QbD)-based formulation design and formulation optimization. Three principal components which represent the overarching properties of 8 selected pharmaceutical fillers were used as factors, whereas factors 4 and 5 represented binder type and binder concentration in a design of experiments (DoE). The majority of process parameters were kept constant to minimize their influence on the granule and drug product quality. 27 DoE batches consisting of binary filler/binder mixtures were processed via continuous twin screw wet granulation followed by tablet compression. Multiple linear regression models were built providing understanding of the impact of filler and binder properties on granule and tablet quality attributes (i.e. 16 DoE responses). The impact of fillers on the granule and tablet responses was more dominant compared to the impact of binder type and concentration. The filler properties had a relevant effect on granule characteristics, such as particle size, friability and specific surface area. Binder type and concentration revealed a relevant influence on granule flowability and friability as well as on the compactability (required compression force during tableting to obtain target hardness). In order to evaluate the DoE models' validity, a verification of the DoE models was performed with new formulations (i.e. a new combination of filler, binder type and binder concentration) which were initially not included in the dataset used to build the DoE models. The combined PCA (principle component analysis)/DoE approach allowed to link the excipient properties with the drug product quality attributes.

AB The aim of this study was to develop solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and introduce them into a direct compression process to evaluate their lubricant properties. The study consisted of preparing glyceryl behenate SLN (Compritol (R) 888 ATO) by hot dispersion, and magnesium stearate SLN by a novel nanoprecipitation/ion exchange method. The ejection force was measured for nanosystems and raw materials in a formulation typically used for direct compression. The smallest particle sizes obtained were 456 nm for Compritol (R) 888 ATO and 330 nm for magnesium stearate. Results show that the NPs used as lubricants in a direct compression model formulation provided efficient lubrication by maintaining the lubricating properties of the system, thereby decreasing the amount of lubricant used compared to the raw material. The lubricating effect showed an increase of 15-30% for magnesium stearate and Compritol (R) 888 ATO, compared to the raw material at concentrations above 2%.

AB The purpose of this work was to investigate the application of different advanced continuous processing techniques (hot melt extrusion and spray drying) to the production of fixed-dose combination (FDC) monolithic systems comprising of hydrochlorothiazide and ramipril for the treatment of hypertension. Identical FDC formulations were manufactured by the two different methods and were characterised using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and modulated differential scanning calorimetry (mDSC). Drug dissolution rates were investigated using a Wood's apparatus, while physical stability was assessed on storage under controlled temperature and humidity conditions. Interestingly both drugs were transformed into their amorphous forms when spray dried, however, hydrochlorothiazide was determined, by PXRD, to be partially crystalline when hot melt extruded with either polymer carrier (Kollidon (R) VA 64 or Soluplus (R)). Hot melt extrusion was found to result in significant degradation of ramipril, however, this could be mitigated by the inclusion of the plasticizer, polyethylene glycol 3350, in the formulation and appropriate adjustment of processing temperature. The results of intrinsic dissolution rate studies showed that hot-melt extruded samples were found to release both drugs faster than identical formulations produced via spray drying. However, the differences were attributable to the surface roughness of the compressed discs in the Wood's apparatus, rather than solid state differences between samples. After a 60-day stability study spray dried samples exhibited a greater physical stability than the equivalent hot melt extruded samples.

AB Radiolabeled antibodies, polyethylene glycol-conjugated (PEGylated) peptides, liposomes, and other materials were investigated as positron-emission tomography (PET) probes. These substances accumulate in tumors but often remain too long in circulation. We investigated the combination of intravenous urokinase injection and its substrate linker as a triggered radioisotope clearance enhancement system to improve imaging contrast. To this end, we synthesized a four-arm PEGylated Cu-64-bombesin analog tetramer with a urokinase substrate linker. In mouse blood, it was almost perfectly cleaved and degraded into smaller radioactive fragments in vitro with urokinase (>= 20,000 IUmL). In mouse blood circulation, similar to 50-65% of the probe was rapidly degraded after the urokinase injection and the radioactive fragments were eliminated mainly from the kidney. In contrast, tumor radioactivity levels did not change, and therefore, the tumors were clearly visualized. The tumor/blood ratio, an indicator of imaging contrast, increased 2.5 times, while elimination of the radioisotope from the blood was enhanced. This approach has the potential to improve imaging contrast using various PET probes. It could also shorten the time required to obtain sufficient contrast and decrease patient radiation exposure.

AB Epidermal powder immunization (EPI) is an alternative technique to the classical immunization route using needle and syringe. In this work, we present the results of an in vivo pilot study in piglets using a dried influenza model vaccine which was applied by EPI using a novel pyrotechnically driven applicator. A liquid influenza vaccine (Pandemrix (R)) was first concentrated by tangential flow filtration and hemagglutinin content was determined by RP-HPLC. The liquid formulation was then transformed into a dry powder by collapse freeze-drying and subsequent cryo-milling. The vaccine powder was attached to a membrane of a novel pyrotechnical applicator using oily adjuvant components. Upon actuation of the applicator, particles were accelerated to high speed as determined by a high-speed camera setup. Piglets were immunized twice using either the novel pyrotechnical applicator or classical intramuscular injection. Blood samples of the animals were collected at various time points and analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our pilot study shows that acceleration of a dried vaccine powder to supersonic speed using the pyrotechnical applicator is possible and that the speed and impact of the particles is sufficient to breach the stratum corneum of piglet skin. Importantly, the administration of the dry vaccine powder resulted in measurable anti-H1N1 antibody titres in vivo.

AB The Venturi tube (VT) is an apparatus that produces turbulence which is taken advantage of to produce nanoparticles (NP) by solvent displacement. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of this device for preparing NP of poly-epsilon-caprolactone. Response Surface Methodology was used to determine the effect of the operating conditions and optimization. The NP produced by VT were characterized by Dynamic Light-Scattering to determine their particle size distribution (PS) and polydispersity index (PDI). Results showed that the Reynolds number (Re) has a strong effect on both PS and process yield (PY). The turbulence regime is key to the efficient formation of NP. The optimal conditions for obtaining NP were a polymer concentration of 1.6 w/v, a recirculation rate of 4.8 L/min, and a stabilizer concentration of 1.1 w/v. The predicted response of the PY was 99.7%, with a PS of 333 nm, and a PDI of 0.2. Maintaining the same preparation conditions will make it possible to obtain NP using other polymers with similar properties. Our results show that VT is a reproducible and versatile method for manufacturing NP, and so may be a feasible method for industrial-scale nanoprecipitation production.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) continues to be a leading cause of cancer related death in the world. Conventional chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin (CDDP) have an unsatisfactory efficacy on HCC due to the poor response, severe toxicity and drug resistance. Curcumin (CUR) could improve the chemosensitivity of HCC to chemotherapy drugs by regulating a variety of signaling pathways. Herein, we describe a combination strategy using co-loaded liposomes to effectively deliver and release CDDP and curcumin (CUR) to HCC for overcoming the unsatisfactory clinical outcome of CDDP monotherapy. In the study, CDDP and CUR co-loaded liposomes (CDDP/CUR-Lip) were prepared by a reverse microemulsion and film dispersion method and their average particle size 294.6 +/- 14.8 nm with uniform size distribution. In vitro study showed that the nano sized CDDP/CUR-Lip could synchronously release both CDDP and CUR to achieve the synergistic effect against HCC cells based on the optimal ratio (1:8) of both drugs. Compared with free drug or encapsulated mono-drug therapy, CDDP/CUR-Lip demonstrated the higher anti-tumor activity in vitro against HepG2 cells with the IC50 of 0.62 mu M. In addition, CDDP/CUR-Lip also increased intracellular ROS level during the HCC cells treatment. Furthermore, compared with single drug formulation, CDDP/CUR-Lip showed the elongated retention time (t(1/2) = 2.38 h) and improved antitumor effect in both mouse hepatoma H22 and human HCC HepG2 xenograft models with reduced side effects. In conclusion, CDDP/CUR-Lip provide an attractive and potential strategy to attain synergistic effect of CDDP and CUR for the treatment of HCC.

AB Herein, a smart pH-sensitive nanoparticle (DGL-PEG-Tat-KK-DMA-DOX) was prepared to achieve the selective intracellular drug delivery. In this nanoparticle, a PEG-grafted cell penetrating peptide (PEG-Tat-KK) was designed and acted as the cell penetrating segment. By introducing the pH-sensitive amide bonds between the peptide and blocking agent (2,3-dimethylmaleic anhydride, DMA), the controllable moiety (PEG-Tat-KK-DMA) endowed the nanoparticle with a charge-switchable shell and temporarily blocked penetrating function, thus improving the specific internalization. Besides, dendrigraft poly-L-lysine (DGL) used as the skeleton can greatly improve the drug loading because of the highly dendritic framework. Under the stimuli of acidic pH, this nanoparticle exhibited a remarkable charge-switchable property. The drug release showed an expected behavior with little release in the neutral pH media but relatively fast release in the acidic media. The in vitro experiments revealed that the cellular uptake and cytotoxicity were significantly enhanced after the pH was decreased. In vivo biodistribution and antitumor research indicated that the nanoparticle had noteworthy specificity and antitumor efficacy with a tumor inhibition rate of 79.7%. These results verified this nanoparticle could efficiently improve the selective intracellular delivery and possessed a great potential in tumor treatment.

AB The poly(cystaminebis(acrylamide)-diaminohexane) (poly(CBA-DAH)) was designed previously as a bio-reducible efficient gene delivery carrier. However, the high weight ratio required to form the polyplexes between poly(CBA-DAH) with pDNA is still a problem that needs to be addressed. To solve this problem and increase the transfection efficiency, poly(ethylenimine) (PEI, 1.8 kDa) was conjugated to poly(CBA-DAH) via disulfide bond. The PEI conjugated poly(CBA-DAH) (PCDP) can bind with pDNA at a very low weight ratio of 0.5 and above, like PEI 25 kDa, and form the polyplexes with nano-size (102-128 nm) and positive surface charge (27-34 mV). PCDP and PCDP polyplexes had negligible cytotoxicity and indicated similar or better cellular uptake than the comparison groups such as PEI 25 kDa and Lipofectamine (R) polyplexes. To confirm the transfection efficiency, the plasmid DNA (pDNA) encoded with the luciferase reporter gene (gWiz-Luc) and green fluorescent protein reporter gene (GFP) were used and treated with PCDP into the A549, Huh-7, and Mia PaCa-2 cells. PCDP/pDNA polyplexes showed highest transfection efficiency in all tested cell lines. In the luciferase assay, PCDP polyplexes showed 10.2 times higher gene transfection efficiency than Lipofectamine (R) polyplexes in mimic in vivo conditions (30% FBS, A549 cells). The VEGF siRNA expressing plasmid (pshVEGF), which is constructed as a therapeutic gene by our previous work, was delivered by PCDP into the cancer cells. The VEGF gene expression of PCDP/pshVEGF polyplexes was dramatically lower than control and the VEGF gene silencing efficiencies of PCDP/pshVEGF (w/w; 10/1) polyplexes were 54% (A549 cells), 77% (Huh-7 cells), and 66% (Mia PaCa-2 cells). In addition, PCDP/pshVEGF had reduced cell viability rates of about 31% (A549 cells), 39% (Huh-7 cells), and 42% (Mia PaCa-2 cells) and showed better results than all comparison groups. In the transfection efficiency and VEGF silencing assay, PCDP polyplexes showed better results than poly(CBA-DAH) at 4-fold lower weight ratio. The data of all experiments demonstrate that the synthesized PCDP could be used for efficient gene delivery and could be widely applied.

AB Plasmid DNA (pDNA) vaccines have the potential for protection against a wide range of diseases including rabies but are rapid in degradation and poor in uptake by antigen-presenting cells. To overcome the limitations, we fabricated a pDNA nanoparticulate vaccine. The negatively charged pDNA was adsorbed onto the surface of cationic PLGA (poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide))-chitosan nanoparticles and were used as a delivery vehicle. To create a hydrogel for sustainable vaccine release, we dispersed the pDNA nanoparticles in poloxamer 407 gel which is liquid at 4 degrees C and turns into soft gels at 37 degrees C, providing ease of administration and preventing burst release of pDNA. Complete immobilization of pDNA to cationic nanoparticles was achieved at a pDNA to nanoparticles ratio (P/N) of 1/50. Cellular uptake of nanoparticles was both time and concentration dependent and followed a saturation kinetics with V-max of 11.389 mu g/mL h and K-m of 139.48 mu g/mL. The in vitro release studies showed the nanoparticulate vaccine has a sustained release for up to 24 days. In summary, pDNA PLGA-chitosan nanoparticles were non-cytotoxic, their buffering capacity and cell uptake were enhanced, and sustained the release of pDNA. We expect our pDNA vaccine's potency will be greatly improved in the animal studies.

AB It is hypothesized that a novel crystalline solid dispersion (CSD) of docetaxel (C-DXT) can be engineered by dispersing native docetaxel (DXT, a BCS class II drug) in sodium acetate crystal (SA). DXT is dissolved in glacial acetic/SA solution and freeze-dried. The resulting C-DXT is characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray analysis (PXRD), LC-MS/MS, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Its cytotoxicity on model cancerous (MCF-7, MDA-MB-468) and normal breast cells (MCF-10A) is assessed by MTS assay. SEM/TEM data and the absence of the characteristics peaks of DXT on the DSC curve (at 193.4 degrees C) and the XRD scan (at 2 theta = 15.31 degrees C and 23.04 degrees C) confirm the presence of C-DXT in SA. The LC-MS/MS data indicates the chemical stability of DXT. The yield and C-DXT loading are 95.2% and 6.52% w/w, respectively. The C-DXT rapidly forms an aqueous non-rigid nanosuspension with a faster drug dissolution rate compared to native DXT. Unlike, control Tween 80/ethanol, SA is noncytotoxic to normal cells. However, C-DXT's cytotoxicity is time and dose dependent for all diseased cells. This unique CSD process might be applicable to other hydrophobic bioactive agents to enhance their safety and efficacy.

AB Parathyroid hormone (PTH1-34)-loaded dry powders were fabricated from aqueous solution for pulmonary administration using supercritical fluid assisted atomization introduced by a hydrodynamic cavitation mixer (SAA-HCM). Herein, chitosan oligosaccharide (CSO) was selected as a carrier in an effort to enhance transmucosal absorption of the drug. Well-defined, separated and spherical PTH(1-34)/CSO composite microparticles were obtained, and the particles size could be well controlled with narrow distribution. Aerodynamic performance was determined using next generation impactor (NGI), and the mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) ranged strictly 1-5 mu m range with fine particle fraction (FPF) up to 63.51%. The structural integrity of coprecipitated PTH(1-34) was validated by HPLC, FT-IR and circular dichroism, and a high loading efficiency up to 92.8% was obtained. TGA analyses revealed its thermal stability was preserved and XRD patterns showed amorphous structure of particles. The SAA-HCM process is proposed as a green technique for preparation of inhalable protein/polymer composite dry powders without use of any organic solvents.

AB Cancer immunotherapy with dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccines has been used to treat various malignancies for more than two decades, however generally showed a limited clinical success. Among various factors responsible for their modest clinical activity is the lack of universally applied, standardized protocols for the generation of clinical-grade DC vaccines, capable of inducing effective anti-tumor immune responses. We investigated Bacterial Ghosts (BGs)- empty envelopes of Gram-negative bacteria - as a tool for optimized production of DC vaccines. BGs possess various intact cell surface structures, exhibiting strong adjuvant properties required for the induction of DC maturation, whereas their empty internal space can be easily filled with a source tumor antigens, e.g. tumor lysate. Hence BGs emerge as an excellent platform for both the induction of immunogenic DC maturation and loading with tumor antigens in a single-step procedure. We compared the phenotype, cytokine secretion profile, functional activity and ability to induce immunogenic T-cell responses in vitro of human monocyte-derived DCs generated using BG platform and DCs matured with widely used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus interferon-gamma cocktail and loaded with tumor lysate. Both approaches induced DC maturation, however BG-based protocol was superior to LPS-based protocol in terms of the ability to induce DCs with a lower tolerogenic potential, resulting in a more robust CD8(+) T cell activation and their functional activity as well as significantly lower induction of regulatory T cells. These superior parameters are attributed, at least in part, to the ability of BG-matured DCs to resist potential immunosuppressive and pro-tolerogenic activity of various tumor cell lysates, including melanoma, renal carcinoma and glioblastoma.

AB Neonates have an increased susceptibility to infections, particularly those caused by intracellular pathogens, leading to high morbidity and mortality rates. This is partly because of a poor response of neonatal CD4(+) T cells, leading to deficient antibody production and a low production of IFN-gamma, resulting in deficient elimination of intracellular pathogens. The poor memory response of human neonates has underpinned the need for improving vaccine formulations. Molecular adjuvants that improve the response of neonatal lymphocytes, such as the ligands of toll-like receptors (TLRs), are attractive candidates. Among them, flagellin, the TLR5 ligand, is effective at very low doses; prior immunity to flagellin does not impair its adjuvant activity. Human CD4(+) and CD8+ T cells express TLR5. We found that flagellin induces the expression of IFN-gamma, IL-1 beta and IL-12 in mononuclear cells from human neonate and adult donors. When human naive CD4(+) T cells were activated in the presence of flagellin, there was high level of expression of IFN-gamma in both neonates and adults. Furthermore, flagellin induced IFN-gamma production in Th1 cells obtained from adult donors; in the Th2 population, it inhibited IL-4 cytokine production. Flagellin also promoted expression of the IFN-gamma receptor in naive CD4(+) T cells from neonates and adults. To test the adjuvant capacity of flagellin in vivo, we used a murine neonate vaccination model for infection with rotavirus, a pathogen responsible for severe diarrhea in young infants. Using the conserved VP6 antigen, we observed an 80% protection against rotavirus infection in the presence of flagellin, but only in those mice previously primed in the neonatal period. Our data suggest that flagellin could be an attractive adjuvant for achieving a Th1 response. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: To contribute to the global demand for oral cholera vaccine (OCV), the production of Euvichol (R) was scaled up with elimination of thimerosal. To demonstrate the equivalence of the variations, a study was carried out in the Philippines.
   Methods: Healthy male and female adults and children in Manila were randomized to receive two doses of Euvichol (R) two weeks apart from either the 100L (Comparator) or the 600L (Test) variation. Primary and secondary immunogenicity endpoints were respectively geometric mean titer (GMT) of vibriocidal antibodies (two weeks post second dose) and seroconversion rate (two weeks after each dose) against O1 Inaba, Ogawa, and O139 serogroups. The GMT of vibriocidal antibodies against O1 Inaba, Ogawa, and O139 two weeks post first dose was also measured. To show the equivalence of two variations of Euvichol (R), the ratio of GMT and the difference of seroconversion rate between Test and Comparator vaccines were tested with equivalence margin of [0.5, 2.0] for GMT ratio and of 15% for seroconversion rate, respectively. Safety assessment included solicited reactogenicity within 6 days after each dose and unsolicited and serious adverse events.
   Results: A total of 442 participants were enrolled. For the overall population, equivalence between Test and Comparator was demonstrated for vibriocidal antibody response against O1 Inaba and Ogawa serotypes and O139 serogroup in both modified intention-to-treat (mITT) and per protocol analysis, since the 95% confidence intervals (CI) of GMT to any serotypes were within the lower and upper boundary [0.5, 2.0]. Seroconversion rates after two doses also showed equivalence for O1 Inaba, Ogawa, and O139. The vaccine was safe and well tolerated, similarly between the two groups.
   Conclusion: The study results support the equivalence of the 600L Euvichol (R) to the 100L formulation in healthy children and adults. The 600L Euvichol (R) is safe and immunogenic in adults and children. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Acinetobacter baumannii; Outer membrane complexes; Vaccine;
   Lipopolysaccharide
ID PROTEINS
AB Outer membrane complex (OMC) vaccines, which contain antigens from the bacterial outer membrane, have been developed for multiple Gram-negative bacteria. However, OMC vaccines demonstrate high endotoxin activity due to the presence of lipopolysaccharide in the bacterial outer membrane, thus precluding their use in humans. We isolated OMCs from an LPS-deficient strain of A. baumannii (IB010) which completely lacks LPS due to a mutation in the IpxD gene. OMCs from IB010 demonstrated a more than 10,000-fold reduction in endotoxin activity compared to OMCs from wild type A. baumannii. Vaccination with 1B010 OMCs produced similar levels of antigen-specific IgG and IgM after two administrations compared to wild type OMCs, and resulted in a similar reduction in post-infection spleen bacterial loads and serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Vaccination with IB010 OMCs provided significant protection against infection compared to control mice, indicating the LPS-free OMCs could contribute to vaccine strategies for preventing infection by A. baumannii.

ID COVERAGE
AB Background: While recommendations to vaccinate adults against pertussis exist, information on uptake for adult tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccine (Tdap) among older adults is limited.
   Methods: We used data from the 45 and Up Study, a prospective cohort of adults aged >= 45 years who completed a questionnaire between 2012 and 2014 asking about pertussis vaccination. We evaluated Tdap uptake following a program providing free vaccine for adults in contact with young children between 2009 and 2012.
   Results: Among 91,432 adults (mean age = 66.3 years, SD = 9.6), 3.1% (n = 2823) reported receiving Tdap prior to the program. This increased seven-fold to 21.8% (n = 19898) after the program finished. Tdap coverage was almost twice as high in women compared to men and among adults more likely to be grandparents than those not.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that funding for a targeted program can help to substantially increase vaccination coverage as well as decrease disparities in the uptake of Tdap in different sub-groups. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: High population coverage is key to the impact of vaccines. However, vaccine coverage estimates in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have repeatedly been shown to be of poor quality. LMICs often rely on 'caregiver recall' of vaccination, the validity and collection method of which remains uncertain. We aimed to critique the quality of caregiver recall and make recommendations for its collection and use.
   Methods: We performed a systematic review for methods assessing childhood vaccination coverage in LMICs. We searched Medline using variations of the key terms: (child) AND (vaccinat*) AND (survey OR recall OR coverage) AND (reliab* OR valid*). We selected articles assessing the quality of recall in LMICs and extracted reported validity, reliability and completeness. We synthesised recommendations on collecting, analysing and presenting caregiver recall for varying resource availabilities.
   Results: Of 1268 articles, 134 full texts were screened and eight were included for review. There was heterogeneity in study designs, ways of incorporating recall data and outcomes measured. Sensitivity of recall was 41-98%; specificity was 12-80%. There was a dearth of reliability measures and no consistent method for dealing with data incompleteness.
   Conclusion: There are quality concerns with caregiver recall and difficulty in assessing it given the lack of a 'gold standard' for vaccine status. To improve coverage estimates and the impact of vaccines, caregiver recall should be used. Other recommendations include: recall is included for those presenting vaccine records; missing data is imputed; recall and record quality are assessed in a sub-sample; and sensitivity analyses are performed.

ID INFECTIONS
AB Classical swine fever (CSF) remains as one of the most important infectious diseases of swine. While prophylactic vaccination is usually prohibited in free countries with industrialized pig production, emergency vaccination is still foreseen. In this context, marker vaccines are preferred as they can reduce the impact on trade.
   The live-attenuated Suvaxyn (R) CSF Marker vaccine by Zoetis (based on pestivirus chimera "CP7_E2alf"), was recently licensed by the European Medicines Agency. Its efficacy for the individual animal had been shown in prior studies, but questions remained regarding protection against transplacental transmission. To answer this question, a trial with eight pregnant sows and their offspring was performed as prescribed by the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals. Six of the sows were intra-muscularly vaccinated on day 44 of gestation, while the other two remained as unvaccinated controls. All sows were challenged with the moderately virulent CSFV strain "Roesrath" and euthanized shortly before the calculated farrowing date. Sows and piglets were grossly examined and necropsied. Organs (spleen, tonsil, lymph node, and kidney), EDTA-blood and serum were collected from all animals. All samples were tested for antibodies against CSFV glycoproteins E2 and E-ms as well as CSFV (virus, antigen and genome). It could be demonstrated that the vaccine complies with all requirements, i.e. no virus was found in the blood of vaccinated sows and their fetuses, and no antibodies were found in the serum of the fetuses from the vaccinated sows. All controls were valid.
   Thus, it was demonstrated that a single dose vaccination in the sows efficiently protected the offspring against transplacental infection with a moderately virulent CSFV strain. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is a diverse array of influenza viruses which circulate between different species, reassort and drift over time. Current seasonal influenza vaccines are ineffective in controlling these viruses. We have developed a novel universal vaccine which elicits robust T cell responses and protection against diverse influenza viruses in mouse and human models. Vaccine mediated protection was dependent on influenza-specific CD4(+) T cells, whereby depletion of CD4(+) T cells at either vaccination or challenge time points significantly reduced survival in mice. Vaccine memory CD4(+) T cells were needed for early antibody production and CD8(+) T cell recall responses. Furthermore, influenza-specific CD4(+) T cells from vaccination manifested primarily Tfh and Th1 profiles with anti-viral cytokine production. The vaccine boosted H5-specific T cells from human PBMCs, specifically CD4(+) and CD8(+) T effector memory type, ensuring the vaccine was truly universal for its future application. These findings have implications for the development and optimization of T cell activating vaccines for universal immunity against influenza. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: New adjuvants have been developed to improve the efficacy of vaccines and for dose sparing capacity and may overcome immuno senescence in the elderly. We reviewed the safety of newly-adjuvanted vaccines in older adults.
   Methods: We searched Medline for clinical trials (CTs) including new adjuvant systems (AS01, AS02, AS03, or MF59), used in older adults, published between 01/1995 and 09/2017. Safety outcomes were: serious adverse events (SAEs); solicited local and general AEs (reactogenicity); unsolicited AEs; and potentially immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs). Standard random effects meta-analyses were conducted by type of safety event and adjuvant type, reporting Relative Risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
   Results: We identified 1040 publications, from which we selected 7, 7, and 12 CTs on AS01/AS02, AS03 and MF59, respectively. 47,602 study participants received newly-adjuvanted vaccine and 44,521 control vaccine, or placebo. Rates of SAEs (RR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.96-1.02), deaths (RR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.92-1.06) and pIMDs (RR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.79-1.1) were comparable in newly-adjuvanted and control groups. Vaccine-related SAEs occurred in <1% of the subjects in both groups. The reactogenicity of AS01/AS02 and AS03 adjuvanted vaccines was higher compared to control vaccines, whereas MF59-adjuvanted vaccines resulted only in more pain. Grade 3 reactogenicity was reported infrequently, with fatigue (RR = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.69-3.64), headache (RR = 2.94, 95% CI = 1.24-6.95), and myalgia (RR = 2.68, 95% CI = 1.86-3.80) occurring more frequently in newly-adjuvanted groups. Unsolicited AEs occurred slightly more frequently in newly-adjuvanted groups (RR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.00-1.08).
   Conclusions: Our review suggests that, within the clinical trial setting, the use of new adjuvants in older adults has not led to any safety concerns, with no increase in SAEs or fatalities. Higher rates for solicited AEs were observed, especially for AS01/AS02 and AS03 adjuvanted vaccines, but AEs were mostly mild and transient. Further evidence will need to come from the use of new adjuvants in the real-world setting, where larger numbers can be studied to potentially detect rare reactions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and porcine trypsin are one of the essential raw materials used in the manufacturing of cell culture based viral vaccines. Being from animal origin, these raw materials can potentially contaminate the final product by known or unknown adventitious agents. The issue is more serious in case of live attenuated viral vaccines, where there is no inactivation step which can take care of such adventitious agents. It is essential to design production processes which can offer maximum viral clearance potential for animal origin products. Ultraviolet-C irradiation is known to inactivate various adventitious viral agents; however there are limited studies on ultraviolet inactivation of viruses in liquid media. We obtained a recently developed UVivatec ultraviolet-C (UV-C) irradiation based viral clearance system for evaluating its efficacy to inactivate selected model viruses. This system has a unique design with spiral path of liquid allowing maximum exposure to UV-C light of a short wavelength of 254 nm. Five live attenuated vaccine viruses and four other model viruses were spiked in tissue culture media and exposed to UV-C irradiation. The pre and post UV-C irradiation samples were analyzed for virus content to find out the extent of inactivation of various viruses. These experiments showed substantial log reduction for the majority of the viruses with few exceptions based on the characteristics of these viruses. Having known the effect of UV irradiation on protein structure, we also evaluated the post irradiation samples of culture media for growth promoting properties using one of the most fastidious human diploid cells (MRC-5). UV-C exposure did not show any notable impact on the nutritional properties of culture media. The use of an UV-C irradiation based system is considered to be promising approach to mitigate the risk of adventitious agents in cell culture media arising through animal derived products.

AB Introduction: In Tuscany, Italy, where a universal immunization program with monovalent meningococcal C conjugate vaccine (MCC) was introduced in 2005, an outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) due to the hypervirulent strain of Neisseria meningitidis C/cc11 occurred in 2015-2016, leading to an immunization reactive campaign using either the tetravalent (ACWY) meningococcal conjugate or the MCC vaccine. During the outbreak, IMD serogroup C (MenC) cases were also reported among vaccinated individuals. This study aimed to characterize meningococcal C conjugate vaccines (MenC-vaccines) failures and to estimate their effectiveness since the introduction (2005-2016) and during the outbreak (2015-2016).
   Methods: MenC cases and related vaccine-failures were drawn from the National Surveillance System of Invasive Bacterial Disease (IBD) for the period 2006-2016. A retrospective cohort-study, including the Tuscany' population of the birth-cohorts 1994-2014, was carried out. Based on annual reports of vaccination, person-years of MenC-vaccines exposed and unexposed individuals were calculated by calendar year, birth-cohort, and local health unit. Adjusted (by birth-cohort, local health unit, and calendar-year) risk-ratios (ARR) of MenC invasive disease for vaccinated vs unvaccinated were estimated by the Poisson model. Vaccine-effectiveness (VE) was estimated as: VE = 1-ARR.
   Results: In the period 2006-2016, 85 MenC-invasive disease cases were reported; 61 (71.8%) from 2015 to 2016. Twelve vaccine failures occurred, all of them during the outbreak. The time-interval from immunization to IMD onset was 20 days in one case, from 9 months to 3 years in six cases, and >= 7 years in five cases. VE was, 100% (95%CI not estimable, p = 0.03) before the outbreak (2006-2014) and 77% (95%CI 36-92, p < 0.01) during the outbreak; VE was 80% (95%CI 54-92, p < 0.01) during the overall period.
   Conclusions: In Tuscany, MenC-vaccine failures occurred exclusively during the 2015-2016 outbreak. Most of them occurred several years after vaccination. VE during the outbreak-period was rather high supporting an effective protection induced by MenC-vaccines. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB PEDV variants, causing severe diarrhea in neonatal suckling piglets with a mortality rate up to 100%, have being epidemic since late 2010 in china. To meet the pressing need of safe and cost-efficient PED maternal vaccines against PEDV variant, we vaccinated growing piglets with a flagellin-adjuvanted PED vaccine rSF-COE-3D by injection at Houhai acupoint. The vaccination not only enhanced the antibody responses of serum IgG/IgA, mucosal IgA and serum neutralizing antibody, but also improved the production of IFN-gamma and IL-4. Moreover, rSF-COE-3D could provide a better protection against the challenge of a high pathogenic PEDV variant, with less diarrhea pigs, less pigs with detectable PEDV shed, lower rank values of feces and less apparent lesions and inflammation in duodenum of the PEDV infected pigs. The improved protective efficiency of rSF-COE-3D compared with COE was mostly benefited from the enhanced production of serum IgA, mucosal IgA in feces and serum neutralizing antibody titers. Taken together, our data suggest that rSF-COE-3D would be a novel efficient PED vaccine. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Improving childhood vaccine coverage is a priority for global health, but challenging in low and middle-income countries. Although previous research has sought to measure determinants of vaccination, most has limitations. We measure determinants using a clearly-defined hypothetical model, multi-faceted data, and modeling strategy that makes full use of the hypothesis and data.
   Methods: We use linked, cross-sectional survey data from households, health facilities, patients and health offices in Uganda and Zambia, and Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling to quantify the proportion of variance in childhood vaccination that is explained by key determinants, controlling for known confounding.
   Results: We find evidence that the leading determinant of vaccination is different for different outcomes. For three doses of pentavalent vaccine, intent to vaccinate (on the part of the mother) is the leading driver, but for one dose of the vaccine, community access is a larger factor. For pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, health facility readiness is the leading driver. Considering specifically-modifiable determinants, improvements in cost, facility catchment populations and staffing would be expected to lead to the largest increase in coverage according to the model.
   Conclusions: This analysis measures vaccination determinants using improved methods over most existing research. It provides evidence that determinants should be approached in the context of relevant outcomes, and evidence of specific determinants that could have the greatest impact in these two countries, if targeted. Future studies should seek to improve our analytic framework, apply it in different settings, and utilize stronger study designs. Programs that focus on a particular determinant should use these results to select an outcome that is appropriate to measure their effectiveness. Vaccination programs in these countries should use our findings to better target interventions and continue progress against vaccine preventable diseases. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute, highly contagious disease, which causes economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. To control the disease, biosecurity and vaccination are required. In the current research, we rapidly attenuated a QX-like IBV field strain ZYY-2014 using passage in embryos at limiting dilution and tested the safety and efficacy of the attenuated Chinese QX-like IBV strain ZYYR-2014 in 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens through spray route. Our result revealed that the attenuated strain presented a decreased pathogenicity in 1-day-old chickens. The strain ZYY-2014 inoculated birds presented typical IBV clinical signs with a mortality of 43%, while the attenuated strain ZYYR-2014 inoculated birds remained healthy. The strain ZYYR-2014 also presented stronger antibody responses and lower viral loads in tracheas, lungs and kidneys. When vaccinated through spray route into 1-day-old SPF chickens, our data suggest a potential of the attenuated ZYYR-2014 strain as a vaccine candidate applied in hatchery, which can contribute in preventing the QX-like IBV infections.

AB Streptococcus pneumoniae has multiple protein antigens on the surface in addition to the serotype specific polysaccharide capsule antigen. Whilst the capsule antigen is the target of the polysaccharide vaccines, bacterial proteins can also act as targets for the immune system. PnuBioVax (PBV) is being developed as a multi-antigen, serotype-independent prophylactic vaccine against S. pneumoniae disease. In this study we have sought to elucidate the immune response to PBV in immunised rabbits. Sera from PBV immunised rabbits contained high levels of IgG antibodies to the PBV vaccine, and pneumococcal antigens PspA, Ply, PsaA and PiuA which are components of PBV, when compared with control sera. The PBV sera supported killing of the vaccine strain TIGR4 in an opsonophagocytic killing assay and heterologous strains 6B, 19F and 15B. In addition, incubation in PBV sera led to agglutination of several strains of pneumococci, inhibition of Ply-mediated lysis of erythrocytes and reduced bacterial invasion of lung epithelial cells in vitro. These data suggest that PBV vaccination generates sera that has multiple mechanisms of action that may provide effective protection against pneumococcal infection and give broader strain coverage than the current polysaccharide based vaccines.

AB A vaccine against Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a major unmet need to prevent the significant morbidity and mortality that it causes in society. In addition to efficacy, such a vaccine must not induce adverse events, as previously occurred with a formalin-inactivated vaccine (FI-RSV). In this study, the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of a molecularly adjuvanted adenovirus serotype 5 based RSV vaccine encoding the fusion (F) protein (Ad-RSVF) is demonstrated in cotton rats. Protective immunity to RSV was induced by Ad-RSVF when administered by an oral route as well as by intranasal and intramuscular routes. Compared to FI-RSV, the Ad-RSVF vaccine induced significantly greater neutralizing antibody responses and protection against RSV infection. Significantly, oral or intranasal immunization each induced protective multi-functional effector and memory B cell responses in the respiratory tract. This study uniquely demonstrates the capacity of an orally administered adenovirus vaccine to induce protective immunity in the respiratory tract against RSV in a pre-clinical model and supports further clinical development of this oral Ad-RSVF vaccine strategy.

AB Background: This study evaluated immunogenicity and safety of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) when the first dose was co-administered with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) in adults aged >= 50 years.
   Methods: In this open label, multi-center study (NCT02045836), participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either the first dose of RZV and PPSV23, co-administered at Day 0 and the second dose of RZV at Month 2 (Co-Ad group), or PPSV23 at Day 0, the first dose of RZV at Month 2 and second dose of RZV at Month 4 (Control group). Co-primary objectives were the RZV vaccine response rate (VRR) in the Co-Ad group and the non-inferiority of the antibody responses to RZV and PPSV23 in the Co-Ad group compared to the Control group. Reactogenicity and safety were also assessed.
   Results: 865 participants were vaccinated (Co-Ad: 432, Control: 433). VRRs to RZV were >98% in both groups. Humoral immune responses to co-administration of RZV and PPSV23 were non-inferior to sequential administration. All three co-primary immunogenicity objectives were met. Solicited local symptoms after the first RZV dose were reported by similar percentages of participants in both groups. Solicited general symptoms were more frequently reported when the first dose of RZV and PPSV23 were co-administered. No differences were apparent between groups after the second RZV dose.
   Conclusions: No immunologic interference was observed between RZV and PPSV23 when co administered in adults >= 50 years. No safety concerns were raised. (C) 2018 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Human adenoviruses (AdVs) have been extensively studied as vectors for gene therapy and vaccination. However, little attention has been paid to AdV vaccine development and treatment. Currently, there is a lack of information concerning the immunogenicity of AdV major capsid proteins. Here, using AdV7 as a model, we compared the immunogenicity and protection efficacy of its three major capsid proteins in DNA forms, pFiber, pHexon and pPenton, on a mouse model. Quantification of antigen-specific antibodies showed that pHexon induced highest IgG in sera while pPenton induced highest IgA in respiratory mucosae. A neutralization assay revealed that pPenton elicited the highest neutralizing activity against the homologous AdV7 in both sera and bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs). In addition, sera and BALs from mice immunized with either of the three constructs had cross-neutralizing activities against the heterologous AdV3. Furthermore, pHexon and pPenton induced Th1/2- and Th1/17-biased cellular responses, respectively, with pFiber being the weakest in the induction of cellular responses. Virus challenge assay showed that, pPenton group had the fastest virus clearance rate, followed by pFiber and pHexon groups. Likewise, the inflammation in the lung was well controlled in pPenton group against virus challenge. Taken together, our data demonstrate that penton base is better than fiber and hexon as a vaccine candidate against AdVs. Our findings provide important information for the development of subunit vaccines against AdVs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: The growing proportion of parents filing personal belief exemptions (PBEs) from school based vaccine requirements, and the clustering of PBEs in particular schools and communities, could weaken herd immunity and increase vaccine-preventable disease. Alignment of vaccine opposition with a particular political party or ideology could substantially increase PBEs. This study extends our understanding of the link between vaccine refusal and politics by identifying longitudinal associations between neighborhood political composition and school-level prevalence of PBEs between 2000 and 2015 in California.
   Methods: California Department of Public Health data on PBEs in kindergartens were matched with political party registration and voting data from the California Statewide Database. Variables for partisan composition and for conservative political ideology, as well as school and neighborhood controls, were used to estimate both mixed-effects and fixed-effects regression models.
   Results: PBE rates increased more rapidly in schools located in highly Republican neighborhoods, and were three times higher than PBE rates in highly Democratic neighborhoods in 2013 (6.6% compared to 2.2%). Mixed-effects models predict a 2.3 percentage-point increase in PBEs between 2007 and 2013 for schools in neighborhoods one standard deviation above the mean for % Republican (59%), compared to a 0.8-point increase for schools in neighborhoods one standard deviation below the mean (24% Republican). Similar results were obtained when using a measure of neighborhood conservatism and when models were estimated using fixed effects.
   Conclusions: Results indicate growing opposition to mandatory vaccinations in Republican/conservative neighborhoods, which could increase PBE clustering and increase the likelihood for outbreaks of disease in areas where conservative values are widely shared.

AB Introduction: Pneumococcus is a commensal of the upper respiratory tract and colonization is common in young children. Carriage studies have provided insights on vaccine effects in children and may also be useful for assessing vaccines in adults. However, culture based prevalence studies in older adults describe low colonization rates. Therefore, we assessed cumulative incidence of pneumococcal colonization in older adults using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the lytA gene and risk factors for carriage.
   Methods: 100 community-dwelling adults >= 65 years were enrolled the winter of 2015 and followed biweekly for 12 months. Medical, vaccination and illness history as well as nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) samples were collected. Combined OP and NP were incubated in enrichment broth and screened using real-time lytA PCR. Samples from new colonization events (lytA PCR+) were cultured on gentamicin blood agar plates. Isolates identified by colony morphology as S. pneumoniae were serotyped using a multiplex combined immunoassay-PCR platform which classifies 96 serotypes. Cumulative incidence of pneumococcal carriage was calculated and risk factors for carriage assessed.
   Results: The cumulative incidence of colonization was 41% by PCR and 14% by culture. Monthly prevalence ranged from 0 to 17% by PCR and 1 to 4% by culture with peaks in the spring and fall. Demographics were similar between colonized and never colonized subjects although colonized were younger (72.4 vs. 75.0 years, P = 0.06). Vaccination with any pneumococcal vaccine before or during study period was associated with decreased risk of becoming colonized (p < 0.001) as was vaccination with either the 13-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13) or 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Pneumococcal colonization in older adults as detected by lytA PCR is frequent and pneumococcal vaccination appears to be associated with decreased risk of carriage. Further study is needed to understand the biological significance of molecular detection of pneumococcus in adults. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Cervical cancer occurrence and mortality are strongly correlated with socioeconomic disadvantage, largely due to unequal access to screening and treatment. Universal human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination provides the opportunity to greatly reduce this global health disparity. Australian Indigenous women have substantially higher rates of cervical cancer than non-Indigenous women, primarily due to under-screening. We investigated HPV infection rates in Indigenous women 7 years after implementation of the national HPV vaccination program.
   Methods: We used a repeat cross-sectional design, with the baseline being provided by an HPV prevalence survey among Indigenous women attending clinics for cervical cytology screening, prior to the start of the vaccination program in 2007. We returned to clinics in four locations during 2014-15, and invited women aged 18-26 years attending for screening to provide a cervical specimen for HPV testing, as well as to complete a short questionnaire and consent to allow access of their records in the National HPV Vaccination Program Register. We used well-established laboratory methods to test specimens for specific HPV genotypes.
   Results: A total of 142 women were recruited at participating sites and compared to 155 who had been recruited at the same locations in the 2007 pre-vaccine survey. The two groups were identical in regard to age, with the more recent group having a higher proportion of hormonal contraception users, and a lower proportion of smokers. The proportion found to have any HPV type fell from 58 to 36% with the decline being entirely due to reductions in vaccine types, which fell by 94% from 24 to 1.4%.
   Conclusion: Australia's national HPV vaccination program appears to be successfully protecting a very high proportion of Indigenous women against vaccine targeted HPV types, who have in the past been at elevated risk of cervical cancer. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As part of a collaborative project between the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the development of a web-based natural language processing (NLP) workbench, we created a corpus of 1000 Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reports annotated for 36,726 clinical features, 13,365 temporal features, and 22,395 clinical-temporal links. This paper describes the final corpus, as well as the methodology used to create it, so that clinical NLP researchers outside FDA can evaluate the utility of the corpus to aid their own work. The creation of this standard went through four phases: pre-training, pre-production, production-clinical feature annotation, and production-temporal annotation. The pre-production phase used a double annotation followed by adjudication strategy to refine and finalize the annotation model while the production phases followed a single annotation strategy to maximize the number of reports in the corpus. An analysis of 30 reports randomly selected as part of a quality control assessment yielded accuracies of 0.97, 0.96, and 0.83 for clinical features, temporal features, and clinical-temporal associations, respectively and speaks to the quality of the corpus.

AB To prevent viral infection at the site of entry, mucosal vaccines are potent tools for inducing IgA secretion for defense. Because Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands serve as strong adjuvants, two ligands that mimic the structure of mycoplasmal and bacterial lipopeptides represent interesting vaccine candidates. Pam3CSK4, a synthetic triacylated lipopeptide, interacts with TLR2/1. Because fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide-1 (FSL-1), a synthetic diacylated lipopeptide, is recognized by TLR2/6, we targeted the potential immuno-inducibility of Pam3CSK4 and FSL-1 as adjuvants of an enterovirus 71 (EV71) mucosa] vaccine. Naive BALB/c mice were used for intranasal immunization three times over a 3-week interval, with results showing that EV71-specific IgG and IgA in serum, nasal washes, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and feces from the EV71 + FSL-1 group were significantly higher than levels observed in mice treated with EV71 + Pam3CSK4, EV71 alone, or the control group treated with phosphate-buffered saline. Furthermore, we observed more EV71-specific IgG and IgA-producing cells in treatments using EV71 formulated with FSL-1. Additionally, T cell-proliferative responses and interferon-gamma and interleukin-17 secretion were significantly increased when inactivated EV71 was formulated using FSL-1. Moreover, serum from immunized mice was capable of neutralizing the infectivity of EV71 (C2 genotype) and was able to cross-neutralize the B4 and B5 genotypes of EV71. Our data suggested that FSL-1 could be used as an efficient adjuvant for intranasal EV71-vaccine immunization. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The current gold-standard potency test for inactivated influenza vaccines is the single radial immunodiffusion (SRD) assay. A number of alternative potency tests for inactivated influenza vaccines have been proposed in recent years. Evaluation of these new potency tests commonly involves comparison with SRD, in order to ascertain that the new method obtains values that correlate with those measured by the standard potency test. Here, we extended comparison of two methods, reverse-phase HPLC and SDS-PAGE, with SRD by assessing the methods' capacity to detect loss of potency induced by various deliberate treatments of vaccine samples. We demonstrate that neither of these methods detected the loss of potency observed by SRD; importantly, neither SDS-PAGE nor reverse-phase HPLC reflected results from mouse experiments that showed decreased immunogenicity and protection in vivo. These results emphasise the importance of assessing the stability-indicating nature, ie the ability to measure loss of vaccine potency, of any potential new potency assay.

AB During the past decade, H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses have diversified genetically and antigenically, suggesting the need for multiple H5N1 vaccines. However, preparation of multiple vaccines from live H5N1 HPAI viruses is difficult and economically not feasible representing a challenge for pandemic preparedness. Here we evaluated a novel multi-Glade recombinant H5N1 virus-like particle (VLP) design, in which H5 hemagglutinins (HA) and N1 neuraminidase (NA) derived from four distinct clades of H5N1 virus were co-localized within the VLP structure. The multi-Glade H5N1 VLPs were prepared by using a recombinant baculovirus expression system and evaluated for functional hemagglutination and neuraminidase enzyme activities, particle size and morphology, as well as for the presence of baculovirus in the purified VLP preparations. To remove residual baculovirus, VLP preparations were treated with beta-propiolactone (BPL). lmmunogenicity and efficacy of multi-Glade H5N1 VLPs were determined in an experimental ferret H5N1 HPAI challenge model, to ascertain the effect of BPL on immunogenicity and protective efficacy against lethal challenge. Although treatment with BPL reduced immunogenicity of VLPs, all vaccinated ferrets were protected from lethal challenge with influenza A/VietNam/1203/2004 (H5N1) HPAI virus, indicating that multi-Glade VLP preparations treated with BPL represent a potential approach for pandemic preparedness vaccines.

AB Vaccine adjuvants are essential for enhancing immune responses during vaccination. However, only a limited number of safe and effective adjuvants, especially mucosal adjuvants, are available for use in vaccines. The development of a practically applicable mucosal adjuvant is therefore urgently needed. Here, we showed that the non-toxic CTA1-DD adjuvant, which combined the full enzymatic activity of the A1 subunit of cholera toxin (CT) with two immunoglobulin-binding domains of Staphylococcus aureus protein A (SpA), promoted mucosal and systemic humoral and cell-mediated immune responses following intranasal administration with H1N1 split vaccine in mice. We demonstrated that CTA1-DD-adjuvant vaccine provided 100% protection against mortality and greatly reduced morbidity in a mouse model. We also showed that addition of CTA1-DD to the vaccine elicited significantly higher hemagglutination inhibition titers and IgG antibodies in sera than alum adjuvant. Furthermore, CTA1-DD significantly promoted the production of mucosal secretory IgA in lung lavages and vaginal lavages. We also showed that CTA1-DD could be used as a mucosal adjuvant to enhance T cell responses. Our results clearly indicated that CTA1-DD contributed to the elicitation of a protective cell-mediated immune response required for efficacious vaccination against influenza virus, which suggested that this adjuvant could be explored further as a clinically safe mucosal vaccine adjuvant for respiratory diseases and other mucosal diseases.

AB Introduction: In the United States, routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is recommended for females and males at age 11 or 12 years; the series can be started at age 9 years. Vaccination is also recommended for females through age 26 years and males through age 21 years. The objective of this study was to assess the health impact and cost-effectiveness of harmonizing female and male vaccination recommendations by increasing the upper recommended catch-up age of HPV vaccination for males from age 21 to age 26 years.
   Methods: We updated a published model of the health impact and cost-effectiveness of 9-valent human papillomavirus vaccine (9vHPV). We examined the cost-effectiveness of (1) 9vHPV for females aged 12 through 26 years and males aged 12 through 21 years, and (2) an expanded program including males through age 26 years.
   Results: Compared to no vaccination, providing 9vHPV for females aged 12 through 26 years and males aged 12 through 21 years cost an estimated $16,600 (in 2016 U.S. dollars) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The estimated cost per QALY gained by expanding male vaccination through age 26 years was $228,800 and ranged from $137,900 to $367,300 in multi-way sensitivity analyses.
   Conclusions: The cost-effectiveness ratios we estimated are not so favorable as to make a strong economic case for recommending expanding male vaccination, yet are not so unfavorable as to preclude consideration of expanding male vaccination. The wide range of plausible results we obtained may underestimate the true degree of uncertainty, due to model limitations. For example, the cost per QALY might be less than our lower bound estimate of $137,900 had our model allowed for vaccine protection against re-infection. Models that specifically incorporate men who have sex with men (MSM) are needed to provide a more comprehensive assessment of male HPV vaccination strategies. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: In March 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration licensed an inactivated Vero cell culture-derived Japanese encephalitis vaccine (JE-VC [IXIARO (R)]) for use in persons aged >= 17 years. In 2013, licensure was extended to include children aged >= 2 months. A previous analysis reviewed adverse events reported to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from May 2009 through April 2012.
   Methods: We reviewed adverse events reported to VAERS following JE-VC administered from May 1, 2012 through April 30, 2016. Adverse event reporting rates were calculated using 802,229 doses distributed.
   Results: During the 4-year period, 119 adverse event reports were received for a reporting rate of 14.8 per 100,000 doses distributed. Nine (8%) adverse events were classified as serious for a reporting rate of 1.1 per 100,000 distributed. The most commonly reported event was hypersensitivity (n = 24; 20%) for a rate of 3.0 per 100,000 doses distributed; 1 anaphylaxis event was reported. Ten (8%) neurologic events were reported for a rate of 1.2 per 100,000 doses distributed; 2 events were classified as seizures. Sixty-three (53%) adverse events occurred after a first dose of JE-VC. Eighty (67%) adverse events occurred after administration of JE-VC with other vaccines. Eleven (9%) adverse events were reported in children; 1 was considered serious.
   Conclusions: These data continue to support the generally favorable safety profile of JE-VC. Reporting rates of adverse events were similar to those of the previous analysis. Although reporting rates of adverse events in children could not be calculated, there were low numbers of reported events in this age group. Post-licensure adverse event surveillance for this relatively new vaccine continues to be important to monitor adverse event reporting rates and identify possible rare serious events.

AB Hajj pilgrims are susceptible to several serious infections and are required to receive multiple vaccinations. Polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines contain carrier proteins such as tetanus toxoid (TT), diphtheria toxoid or a mutant of diphtheria toxoid (CRM197). These carrier proteins may interact with other conjugate or combination vaccines containing tetanus or diphtheria on concurrent or sequential administration. We examined the immune interaction of separate and concomitant administration of a tetanus/diphtheria/acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine with a TT-conjugated quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine (MCV4) (coadministered with 13-valent pneumococcal CRM197-conjugate vaccine [PCV13]) in adult Australian pilgrims before attending Hajj in 2015.
   We randomly assigned each participant to one of three vaccination schedules. Group 1 received Tdap 3-4 weeks before receiving MCV4 coadministered with PCV13. Group 2 received all three vaccines concomitantly. Group 3 received MCV4 and PCV13 3-4 weeks before Tdap. Blood samples were collected at baseline, at each vaccination visit and 3-4 weeks after vaccination and tested for response to meningococcal serogroups C, W and Y using a serum bactericidal antibody (rSBA) assay with baby rabbit complement, and to diphtheria and tetanus toxoid, measuring IgG antibodies by ELISA. Participants completed symptom diaries after each vaccination. A total of 166 participants aged 18-64 (median 42) years were recruited, of whom 160 completed the study. Compared to the other groups, Group 1 (given Tdap first) had significantly lower proportion of subjects achieving a >= 4-fold rise in rSBA for serogroup W. No difference was detected across the three groups in achieving protection threshold (rSBA >= 8 post vaccination) or SBA geometric mean titre (GMT) post vaccination.
   Group 3, which was given MCV4/PCV13 first, had high levels of antibody against diphtheria and tetanus than the other groups, when tested prior to receipt of Tdap; Only the anti-tetanus responses remained significantly higher after Tdap administration. No serious adverse events were reported.
   In conclusion, when multiple vaccination is required for Hajj pilgrims, administering Tdap concurrently with MCV4/PCV13 produces adequate immune responses, and avoids meningococcal immune interference, in the convenience of a single consultation. However, giving Tdap 3-4 weeks after MCV4/PCV13 has the advantage of an enhanced tetanus toxoid response. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Context: Between 2004 and 2016, in the province of Quebec (Canada), 4 new antigens were added in the early childhood vaccine schedule from birth to 18 months, increasing the number of injections or doses needed from 7 to 12. These additions may have decreased the proportion of children who had received all recommended vaccines.
   Objectives: To assess the impact of the introduction of new vaccines to the childhood schedule on the 24 month vaccine coverage from 2006 to 2016 and identify factors associated with incomplete vaccination status by 24 months of age.
   Methods: We used the data from six cross-sectional vaccine coverage surveys conducted every two years which included a total of 3515 children aged 2 years old and randomly selected from the Quebec public health insurance database. Factors associated with an incomplete vaccine status by 24 months were identified with multivariable logistic regression.
   Results: Despite the addition of 4 new vaccine antigens since 2004, the vaccine coverage remained high from 2006 (82.4%) through 2016 (88.3%) for vaccines present in the schedule since 2006. In 2016, vaccine coverage was 78.2% for all vaccines included in the schedule. The vaccine coverage of new vaccines increases rapidly within 2 years of their introduction. For both new and older vaccines, incomplete vaccine status by 24 months of age is associated with a delay of 30 days or more in receiving the vaccines scheduled at 2 and 12 months of age.
   Conclusions: Increasing to 12 the number of doses in the recommended schedule has slightly reduced the vaccine coverage by 24 months of age and the vaccine coverage of vaccines already in the schedule remained stable over the years. Future additions to the vaccine schedule may not be similarly accepted by the population and this will require continuing the monitoring of vaccine coverage. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, a novel cascade cycle is proposed to recover energy from a medium temperature waste stream and a liquefied natural gas vaporization unit simultaneously. To analyze the system, its performance is compared with a single organic Rankine cycle and a single transcritical carbon dioxide cycle at the same operation conditions. Both energy and exergy analyses are applied to the system. In addition, different working fluids are examined in this study. In order to find the best configuration and working fluid, optimization algorithm is utilized. Results showed that the best performance is for a cascade cycle with Pentane as working fluid for ORC section. Its exergy efficiency is evaluated 13.08%, while the highest exergy efficiency for an ORC and a transcritical CO2 cycle is 12.3% and 11.24%, respectively. This increase in efficiency is because of better thermal match between hot and cold streams in vapor generator and condenser sections. Based on the exergy analysis, the highest rate of exergy destruction in all cycles belongs to the preheater and condenser respectively. Finally, sensitivity analysis showed that in the proposed cascade cycle, ORC's condenser pressure and pinch temperature of the heat exchanger are the most important parameters which can significantly affect the system performance and their value should be selected carefully.

AB A tubular proton conducting solid oxide fuel cell (H-SOFC) integrated with internal dry methane reforming (DMR) layer is numerically studied for power and syngas cogeneration using CO2 and CH4 as fuel by the Finite Element Method. The coupled heat and mass transporting with electrochemical reactions and chemical reactions (DMR, water gas shifting reaction and methane steam reforming) are fully considered. The model is substantially validated with experimental data of DMR catalyst characterization and SOFC button cell electrochemical characterization. The base case analyses are conducted at open circuit voltage (OCV) and 0.7 V of the DMR-SOFC. It is found that the CO2 conversion and CH4 conversion can be increased by 4.8% and 21.6%, respectively, by increasing the operating voltage of DMR-SOFC from OCV to 0.7 V, with the coproduction of electricity (1.5 W). These conversion enhancements were caused by the in-situ integration of the endothermal DMR reaction and exothermal H-2 electrochemical oxidation. Effects of operating voltage and inlet flow rate of feeding gas are evaluated. The voltage is suggested to be higher than 0.5 V to avoid large temperature gradient in the reactor. It is also found that conversion ratios of both CH4 and CO2 decrease from over 90% to be below 60% as the fuel flow rate is increased from 40 cm(3) min(-1) to 80 cm(3) min(-1).

AB In order to improve the starting performance of straight-bladed vertical axis wind turbine (SB-VAWT), an innovative truncated-cone-shaped wind gathering device (WGD) which could be installed up and down of the rotor was proposed to collect more incoming flow and increase wind speed. The main object of this study is to research the starting performance effects of the main structural parameters of the WGD on small-scale SB-VAWT. The studied parameters of the WGD included the cone angle, height and the distance to rotor. Based on the method of quadratic rotary orthogonal combination design, starting torque performance effects of the three parameters of WGD on SB-VAWT were researched by numerical simulation firstly. Two better structural parameter combinations of WGD were obtained. The static flow fields around the rotor with WGD were calculated. Furthermore, the model of the two kinds of WGD were designed and made. Wind tunnel tests were carried out on the static torque characteristics, rotational speed performance from static condition to stable rotational condition and the power characteristics at different tip speed ratios. According to the results, the new WGD proposed in this study was proved to be effective for both the static and dynamic performance improvement of SB-VAWT. This research can provide a reference for the study of optimum WGD for improving the performance of SB-VAWT.

AB The study of annular thermoelectric generators (ATEG) has attracted more attention in recent years due to their ability to cover round shaped surfaces. Moreover, transient and pulsed inputs have been introduced as some of the effective methods to enhance the performance of thermoelectric devices. Hence, in the present study, a three-dimensional transient simulation of ATEG including the influence of Thomson effect is carried out based on finite element method. The effect of pulsed heat inputs on the performance of ATEG is studied considering rectangular, triangular, sinusoidal and two types of the sawtooth input functions for modeling the transient heat load. Electric current, voltage, output power and conversion efficiency of ATEG under pulsed and steady-state heating are compared. The effects of two critical parameters, the ratio of maximum heat flux to minimum heat flux (b/a) and duty cycle (t(0)/tau) values on the performance of ATEG are studied. Results indicate that transient pulsed heating enhances the efficiency of ATEG for all types of heat input functions. In addition, it is found that rectangular input function leads to better results compared to other functions. Also, it is shown that for a constant amount of duty cycle, the increment of (b/a) increases the performance of ATEG unit. For duty cycle value of 0.1 and (b/a = 48) a maximum efficiency enhancement of 249.36% is achieved when the rectangular input function is employed. It is found that in the range of the studied values of (b/a), the duty cycle of 0.4 leads to better results. A comparison of results with and without Thomson effect proves that the Thomson effect decreases the performance of ATEG. Additionally, it is observed that for sawtooth input functions, the implementation of heat load gradient plays an important role determining the performance.

AB Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is an emerging technology for energy conversion with inherent CO2 separation. Supercritical CO2 (sCO(2)) Brayton cycle is a promising way for efficient power production with compactness. In this work, CLC and sCO(2) cycle were integrated for combined heat and power (CHP) cogeneration with CO2 capture. Coal was directly used as fuel for CLC, and CLC acted as heat source to drive a sCO(2) cycle with reheating and recompression. The heat in sCO(2) cooling and CO2 compression processes was recovered for district heating. A comprehensive analysis with first law based efficiency was performed to investigate the performance of the proposed cycle. For a baseline case of the proposed configuration, the net power efficiency was 41.3%, the heating efficiency was 40.4% and the resulting total efficiency was 81.7%, including CO2 compression to 120 bar. The effects of turbine inlet temperature, turbine inlet pressure, fuel reactor temperature, air reactor temperature, oxygen carrier ratio, inert support ratio, and air ratio on the thermal performance, including net power efficiency, heating efficiency, and total efficiency were analyzed as well.

AB This paper focuses on the development of a test protocol for the analysis of tar collected from an oxy-steam gasification system with a downdraft reactor configuration using biomass. A 10 kg.h(-1) oxy-steam gasification system developed at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore was used for the studies. The present work involves qualitative and quantitative analyses to estimate the amount and nature of the tar present in the gas produced. The major focus of the work has been towards establishing protocols to estimate the content and concentration of various species present in the raw and clean gas. The method uses internal standard alongside external standards while analysing compounds using GC-MS and GC-FID. The study clearly establishes the need for using different reference compounds like naphthalene and phenol for the quantification process depending upon the nature of compounds manifesting as tar molecules. Further, it has been established that the conventionally used gravimetric analysis has limitations towards estimating the total amount of tar. GC-MS is used for the identification of the compounds. The results from the study indicate that the average values obtained for clean gas and raw gas are mg.Nm(-3) and 168 mg.Nm(-3) with gravimetric analysis and 37.6 mg.Nm(-3) and 267 mg.Nm(-3) with GC-MS/FID method. The lower hydrocarbons, having the number of carbon atoms in the range of 1-5, which are not considered as tar compounds, are absent in the clean gas and are quantified to be 10.6 mg.Nm(-3) in the raw gas. Finally, the study also captures a technique of analysis and quantification which is of general nature, used generally in organic compound estimation, and therefore can be applied as a generic procedure. The results indicate that the level of tar in the clean gas is low, making the gas suitable for a variety of applications, and the effluent treatment process simpler. The analysis presents an estimate of the tar level obtained with the GC-FID technique using both internal and external calibration curves. These results are compared with results from a similar approach using GC-MS for quantification and from the external calibration curves using GC-FID and GC-MS. These studies confirm that the approach presented here is suitable for the present research activity.

AB The effects of hot-water outlet temperature, compressor discharge pressure, compressor rotation speed, and expansion valve opening on the ejector and overall system performance were investigated for tap water outlet temperatures ranging from 50 to 90 degrees C. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the ejector-expansion heat pump system reaches 4.6 when the tap water outlet temperature is 70 degrees C, which is 10.3% higher than the corresponding basic cycle. Compared to the basic system, adding an ejector is more effective for the generation of high-temperature hot water. The COP of the ejector-expansion heat pump system increases; however, the COP improvement ratio MOP decreases with the increase in the discharge pressure because of lower pressure lift ratio and ejector efficiency. The COP and COP increase when the compressor rotation speed decreases under our test conditions; simultaneously, the heat capacity decreases.

AB A novel ternary eutectic salt mixture for high-temperature sensible heat storage, composed of sodium chloride, potassium chloride and magnesium chloride (NaKMg-Cl) was developed based on a phase diagram generated with FactSage (R). The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique was used to experimentally validate the predicted melting point of the ternary eutectic composition, which was measured as 387 degrees C, in good agreement with the prediction. The ternary eutectic was compared to two binary salts formulated based on prediction of the eutectic composition by FactSage, but unfortunately DSC measurements showed that neither binary salt composition was eutectic. Nonetheless, the measured thermo-physical properties of the ternary and the two binary mixtures are compared. Liquid heat capacities of both the ternary and binary salts were determined by using DSC with sapphire as the standard reference. The average heat capacity of the ternary mixture was recorded as 1.18 J g(-1) K-1. The mass loss of the molten eutectic salts was studied up to 1000 degrees C using a thermogravimetric analyser in nitrogen, argon and air. The results showed a significant mass loss due to vaporisation in an open system, particularly above 700 degrees C. However, simulation of mass loss in a closed system with an inert cover gas indicates storage temperatures above 700 degrees C may be feasible, and highlights the importance of the design of the storage tank system. In terms of storage material cost, the NaKMg-Cl mixture is approximately 4.5 USD/kWh, which is 60% cheaper than current state-of-the-art nitrate salt mixtures.

AB The wind speed forecasting is crucial for the wind power conversion and management. In this study, a new hybrid model consisting of the EWT (Empirical Wavelet Transform) decomposition, the LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) network, the RELM (Regularized Extreme Learning Machine) network and the IEWT (Inverse Empirical Wavelet Transform) reconstruction is proposed. The hybrid model are carried out as follows: the EWT is employed to decompose the raw wind speed series into several sub-layers; the LSTM network is executed as the principal predictor of each sub-layer; the RELM network is utilized as the subordinate predictor to model the forecasting error series of each sub-layer; the IEWT is adopted to construct the final forecasting series and filter the outliers. To validate the forecasting capacity of the proposed hybrid EWT-LSTM-RELM-IEWT model, seven different forecasting models are implemented on five wind speed time series. The experimental results demonstrate that: (1) the single LSTM model cannot provide satisfactory wind speed forecasting results in the involved wind speed time series; (2) the EWT can promote the wind speed forecasting accuracy and stability of the LSTM network significantly; (3) the RELM network based error modeling method improves the performance of the proposed EWT-LSTM-IEWT forecasting structure significantly; (4) the IEWT based outlier correction method is effective in promoting the wind speed forecasting accuracy and stability in the proposed EWT-LSTM-RELM structure; and (5) among all the involved models, the proposed hybrid model has the best performance in one-step to five-step predictions.

AB With the increasing popularity of large scale Knowledge Graph (KG)s, many applications such as semantic analysis, search and question answering need to link entity mentions in texts to entities in KGs. Because of the polysemy problem in natural language, entity disambiguation is thus a key problem in current research. Existing disambiguation methods have considered entity prominence, context similarity and entity-entity relatedness to discriminate ambiguous entities, which are mainly working on document or paragraph level texts containing rich contextual information, and based on lexical matching for computing context similarity. When meeting short texts containing limited contextual information, such as web queries, questions and tweets, those conventional disambiguation methods are not good at handling single entity mention and measuring context similarity. In order to enhance the performance of disambiguation methods based on context similarity with such short texts, we propose SCSNED method for disambiguation based on semantic similarity between contextual words and informative words of entities in KGs. Specially, we exploit the effectiveness of both knowledge-based and corpus-based semantic similarity methods for entity disambiguation with SCSNED. Moreover, we propose a Category2Vec embedding model based on joint learning of word and category embedding, in order to compute word-category similarity for entity disambiguation. We show the effectiveness of these proposed methods with illustrative examples, and evaluate their effectiveness in a comparative experiment for entity disambiguation in real world web queries, questions and tweets. The experimental results have identified the effectiveness of different semantic similarity methods, and demonstrated the improvement of semantic similarity methods in SCSNED and Category2Vec over the conventional context similarity baseline. We further compare the proposed approaches with the state of the art entity disambiguation systems and show the performances of the proposed approaches are among the best performing systems. In addition, one important feature of the proposed approaches using semantic similarity, is the potential application on any existing KGs since they mainly use common features of entity descriptions and categories. Another contribution of the paper is an updated survey on background of entity disambiguation in KGs and semantic similarity methods. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Successful Location-Based Services should offer accurate and timely information consumption recommendations to their customers, relevant to their contextual situation. To achieve this and provide the best available recommendations to the user, researchers and developers analyse available data via exploiting data mining techniques. Unfortunately, in some cases, due to lack of available data (e.g. a relatively new member with a limited history) the above technologies and methods are not very effective. In this paper, a novel hybrid approach to alleviate the above-mentioned problem, known as cold start in context-aware recommender systems, is presented. This work aims to help researchers and developers to cope with this problem by combining a) community created knowledge, b) ontologies c) association rule mining and d) an innovative scoring function based on probability metrics.

AB High utility itemset mining (HUIM) has emerged as an important research topic in data mining, with applications to retail-market data analysis, stock market prediction, and recommender systems, etc. However, there are very few empirical studies that systematically compare the performance of state-of-the-art HUIM algorithms. In this paper, we present an experimental evaluation on 10 major HUIM algorithms, using 9 real world and 27 synthetic datasets to evaluate their performance. Our experiments show that EFIM and d2HUP are generally the top two performers in running time, while EFIM also consumes the least memory in most cases. In order to compare these two algorithms in depth, we use another 45 synthetic datasets with varying parameters so as to study the influence of the related parameters, in particular the number of transactions, the number of distinct items and average transaction length, on the running time and memory consumption of EFIM and d2HUP. In this work, we demonstrate that, d2HUP is more efficient than EFIM under low minimum utility values and with large sparse datasets, in terms of running time; although EFIM is the fastest in dense real datasets, it is among the slowest algorithms in sparse datasets. We suggest that, when a dataset is very sparse or the average transaction length is large, and running time is favoured over memory consumption, d2HUP should be chosen. Finally, we compare d2HUP and EFIM with two newest algorithms, mHUlMiner and ULB-Miner, and find these two algorithms have moderate performance. This work has reference value for researchers and practitioners when choosing the most appropriate HUIM algorithm for their specific applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The blind-spot detection (BSD) system is designed to prevent accidents during lane changing and overtaking scenarios. Current BSD systems that use side- or rear-view cameras suffer from limited performance because of the severe distortion in the appearance of nearby vehicles depending on their positions relative to the host vehicle. To overcome such limitations, this manuscript introduces a side-rectilinear image to detect and use the side parts of the vehicles. In the side-rectilinear image, the side parts of the vehicles do not contain radial or perspective distortions; consequently, the appearance of the tires remains identical from different positions on the vehicle. By utilizing this rectilinear image, a rear-camera-based BSD system that detects both vehicles and motorcycles is constructed to prevent possible accidents occurring in blind spots. The proposed BSD system detects the vehicles in three stages: tire hypothesis generation/verification, front-rear tire classification, and vehicle hypothesis generation/verification. For motorcycle detection, the proposed system detects the lower parts of the motorcycle, which are not affected by the appearance of the drivers and cargos. Using the property of the side-rectilinear image, the detection procedures of the proposed system are straight-forward and resemble the object detection recognition rules of humans. Based on the detection results, the system tracks nearby vehicles and gives a warning signal to the driver when there are obstacles in blind spots. An evaluation of the system performance demonstrates that the warning rate of the proposed system outperforms that of radar-based systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Past medical cases, hence clinical experience, are invaluable resources in supporting clinical practice, research, and education. Medical professionals need to be able to exchange information about patient cases and explore them from subjective perspectives. This requires a systematic and flexible methodology to case representation for supporting the exchange of processable patient information. We present an ontology based approach to modeling patient cases and use patients with liver disease conditions as an example. To this end a novel ontology, Lico, that utilizes well known medical standards is proposed to represent liver patient cases. The utility of the proposed approach is demonstrated with semantic queries and reasoning using data collected from real patients. The preliminary results are promising in regards to the potentials of ontology based medical case representation for building case-based search and retrieval systems, paving the way towards a Clinical Experience Sharing platform for comparative diagnosis, research, and education.

AB Due to technological advancement and the explosive growth of electrically stored information, automated methods are required to aid users in maintaining and processing this huge amount of information. Experts, as well as machine learning processes on large volumes of data, are the main sources of knowledge. Knowledge extraction is an important step in framing expert and intelligent systems. However, the knowledge extraction phase is very slow or even impossible due to noise and large size of data. To enhance the productivity of machine learning algorithms, feature selection or attribute reduction plays a key role in the selection of relevant and non-redundant features to improve the performance of classifiers and interpretability of data. Many areas like machine learning, image processing, data mining, natural language processing and Bioinformatics, etc., which have high relevancy to expert and intelligent systems, are applications of feature selection.
   Rough set theory has been successfully applied for attribute reduction, but this theory is inadequate in the case of attribute reduction of real-valued data set as it may lose some information during the discretization process. Fuzzy and rough set theories have been combined and various attribute selection techniques were proposed, which can easily handle the real-valued data. An intuitionistic fuzzy set possesses a strong ability to represent information and better describing the uncertainty when compared to the classical fuzzy set theory as it considers positive, negative and hesitancy degree simultaneously for an object to belong to a set. This paper proposes a novel mechanism of attribute selection using tolerance-based intuitionistic fuzzy rough set theory. For this, we present tolerance-based intuitionistic fuzzy lower and upper approximations and formulate a degree of dependency of decision features over the set of conditional features. Moreover, the basic results on lower and upper approximations based on rough sets are extended for intuitionistic fuzzy rough sets and analogous results are established. In the end, the proposed algorithm is applied to an example data set and the comparison between tolerance based fuzzy rough and intuitionistic fuzzy rough sets approaches for feature selection is presented. The proposed concept is found to be better performing in the form of selected attributes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The antioxidant activity and genotoxicity of isogarcinol were assessed by several in vitro tests. Its IC50 values for DPPH. and ABTS. were 36.3 +/- 3.35 mu M and 16.6 +/- 3.98 mu M, respectively, which were all lower than those of VC and BHT. Isogarcinol had no cyctotoxic or promotional activities at 1-10 mu M in the CCK-8 assay, and negligible genotoxic effects at 50-500 mu M on HepG2 cells by the single-cell gel electrophoresis assay. Pre-incubation of the cells with 0.5-1.5 mu M isogarcinol, before exposure to H2O2, significantly increased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. Isogarcinol also reduced intercellular reactive oxygen species accumulation, lactate dehydrogenase release and malondialdehyde levels, and increased superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione levels. Western-blot analysis revealed that it up-regulated pro-caspase-3 and reduced cleaved caspase-3 during H2O2-induced oxidative stress. All the above results indicate that isogarcinol promises to be useful as a natural antioxidant.

AB The effect of lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) and melissa (Melissa Officinalis) waste on preparation, characteristics and shelf life of bread was investigated. It was found that lavender and melissa waste, generated yearly in large amounts, were rich on polyphenols (especially rosmarinic acid) and aroma compounds, and exhibited high antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. The bread with 2.5% lavender waste was characterized with the highest loaf volume and loaf specific volume. The total dietary fiber increased three times and the polyphenols and flavonoids increased more than four times for breads with added 5% lavender and melissa waste, compared to control sample. The breads with 2.5% and 5% added lavender waste had increased shelf life (up to 96 h) compared to control, and no fungal or bacterial spoilage was observed during storage at 22 degrees C, 30 degrees C and 37 degrees C for four days. The sensory evaluation demonstrated that the consumers preferred mainly bread with 2.5% lavender waste.

AB The aim of this study was to compare methods for efficient extraction of green tea metabolites. Aqueous green tea leaf powder extracts were prepared by ultra-sonication extraction (UE), agitation extraction (AE), and the conventional extraction method (control) at different temperatures (60, 70, and 80 degrees C) and times (5-30 min). Compared to the control, both UE and AE techniques significantly increased the yields of polyphenols (threefold), catechins (two-fold), and flavonoids (two-fold), and resulted in higher antioxidant activity. For both techniques, highest extraction efficiency of bioactive metabolites occurred at 80 degrees C for 20 min. Caffeine, total free amino acid, vitamin C, and total soluble solid contents were also significantly increased using either technique compared to the control. Thus, AE and UE have similar extraction efficiencies and could be used to prepare antioxidant-rich green tea extract or green tea extract powder.

AB Pistachio hulls, important by-products of pistachio processing, were extracted using an environmentally friendly process with subcritical water (SCW) at a pressure of 6.9 MPa in the range of 110 and 190 degrees C, and a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Detailed HPLC-DAD-ESI/MSn analyses allowed the identification of 49 phenolic compounds in the SCW extracts. Total gallotannin yields up to 33 g/kg were reached at 150-170 degrees C, where gallic acid (22.2 g/kg) and penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose (9.77 g/kg) levels were 13.2- and 10.6-fold higher than those in the aqueous methanol extracts. Flavonols were also effectively extracted at 110-150 degrees C (4.37-5.65 g/kg), while anacardic acid recovery was poor (1.13-2.77 g/kg). Accordingly, high amounts of anacardic acids (up to 50.7 g/kg) were retained in the extraction residue, revealing that SCW extraction allowed selective extraction of gallotannins and flavonols. Antioxidant capacities ranged from 0.68 to 1.20 mmol Trolox equivalents (TE)/g for SCW extracts increasing with temperature up 190 degrees C.

AB Water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) emulsions could be utilized for fat-reduced food formulation and delivery of bioactive nutrients. However, due to thermodynamic instability, it is difficult to prepare stable double emulsions. The purpose of this study was to improve the stability of W/O/W double emulsions containing 2.0 M MgCl2 by adding porcine gelatin in the inner water phase. The impact of gelatin on the physical stability, microstructure and micro-rheological properties of W/O/W emulsions was investigated. It was found that, when the concentration of porcine gelatin exceeded 4.0 wt%, the stability of emulsions was improved, due to increased viscoelasticity of emulsion droplets. When MgCl2 concentration increased to 2.0 M, the particle size of emulsions increased, due to the osmotic pressure gradient, and the presence of gelatin further increased the droplet size. Confocal microscopy results showed that the presence of gelatin could improve the stability of W/O/W emulsions against coalescence

AB The development of fat replacers to obtain healthier/functional foods is a constant challenge. With this aim, double emulsions (DE) with a blend of olive, linseed and fish oils as oil phase were developed. To prevent the oxidation of these oils, gallic acid and quercetin were incorporated in the internal and the external aqueous phase (W-2), respectively, according to a factorial design. Considering the low solubility of quercetin in water, it was included in O/W nanoemulsions (QN), thus being freely dispersible in W-2. The antioxidant activity in DE was attributed to QN, which significantly improved the oxidative stability of DE/QN. Furthermore, DE/QN showed good physical stability with a limited coalescence during storage at 4 degrees C for 28 days, significantly longer than time usually required for food ingredients. Therefore, DE/QN could be used as potential fat replacer in a variety of food formulations, providing blends of fatty acids consistent with dietary recommendations.

AB The interaction of tannins with salivary proteins is involved in astringency. This paper focussed on saliva lining oral mucosae, the mucosal pellicle. Using a cell-based model, the impact of two dietary tannins (EgC and EgCG) on the mucosal pellicle structure and properties was investigated by microscopic techniques. The role of basic Proline-Rich-Proteins (bPRPs) in protecting the mucosal pellicle was also evaluated.
   At low (0.05 mM) tannin concentration, below the sensory detection threshold, the distribution of salivary mucins MUC5B on cells remained unaffected. At 0.5 and 1 mM, MUC5B-tannin aggregates were observed and their size increased with tannin concentration and with galloylation. In addition, 3 mM EgCG resulted in higher friction forces measured by AFM. In presence of bPRPs, the size distribution of aggregates was greatly modified and tended to resemble that of the "no tannin" condition, highlighting that bPRPs have a protective effect against the structural alteration induced by dietary tannins.

AB The bio-residues resulting from the wine industry (grape pomace made up of skins, seeds and stems) are often undervalued but constitute a potential source of bioactive phenolic compounds that can be applied in several industries. In this context, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the phenolic profile of Vitis vinifera L. grape pomace (skins, seeds and their mixture), and correlate them with its antioxidant, cytotoxic and antibacterial activities. The seeds showed the highest amount of phenolic compounds and also the highest antioxidant, cytotoxic and antibacterial activities. The skins revealed the highest levels of anthocyanins and p-coumaric acid hexoside. Strong correlations were observed between the presence of phenolic compounds and all the bioactivities studied. These by-products are good sources of phenolic compounds with high antioxidant and antibacterial activity, and also presenting a moderate cytotoxicity activity. These added-value by-products have great applicability in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.

AB Chitooligosaccharide is widely used as a functional food additive and a valuable pharmacological agent. The transformation of chitinous biomass into valuable bioactive chitooligosaccharides is one of the most exciting applications of chitosanase. A novel glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 46 chitosanase (GsCsn46A) from rhizobacterium Gynuella sunshinyii was cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. GsCsn46A showed maximal activity at pH 5.5 and 30 degrees C. GsCsn46A featured remarkable cold-adapted property, which controllably hydrolyzed chitosan to three types of chitooligosaccharides at the mild reaction condition (reaction condition: pH 5.5 at 30 degrees C; method for stopping the reaction: 50 degrees C for 30 min). The yields of three types of chitooligosaccharides products (degree of polymerization (DP): 2-7, 2-5 and 2-3) were 70.9%, 87.1% and 94.6% respectively. This novel cold-adapted chitosanase provides a cleaner production process for the controllable preparation of chitooligosaccharides with the specific DP.

AB Flavonoids are important compounds for grape and wine quality. Foliar fertilization with iron compounds has been reported to have a substantial impact on grape composition in the grapevines growing in calcareous soil. However, much less is known about its real impact on flavonoid composition. In the present study, Ferric ethylenediamine di (O-hydroxyphenylacetic) acid (Fe-EDDHA) was foliar applied to Merlot (Vitis vinifera L.) grapevines growing in calcareous soil over two consecutive vintages in order to study its effect on grape flavonoid composition. Fe-EDDHA foliar supply tended to increase grape sugar, anthocyanin and flavonol content, decrease acid content and enhance the juice pH when compared to the control. Principal component analysis showed that the vintage also had influence on grape quality. The results suggested that Fe-EDDHA foliar application had an enhancement effect on grape secondary metabolism, and the effect increased the nutritional value of the consequent grapes and wines.

AB In the present study, food grade mixed surfactant-based beta-carotene nanoemulsions were prepared without using any co-surfactant. Response surface methodology (RSM) along with central composite design (CCD) was used to investigate the effect of independent variables (surfactant concentration, ultrasonic homogenization time and oil content) on response variables. RSM analysis results revealed that experimental results were best fitted into a quadratic polynomial model with regression coefficient values of more than 0.900 for all responses. Optimized preparation conditions for beta-carotene nanoemulsions were 5.82% surfactant concentration, 4 min ultrasonic homogenization time and 6.50% oil content. The experimental values at optimized preparation conditions were 119.33 nm droplet size, 2.67p-Anisidine value and 85.63% beta-carotene retention. This study will be helpful for the fortification of aqueous products with beta-carotene.

AB Hen egg is commonly used in some cereal-based food, including cakes and bread. Ovalbumin, one of the major components of egg white protein, can affect the performance of the food product. The interaction between ovalbumin and gluten protein and its effect on property of dough and quality of Chinese steamed bread was investigated in this study. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) patterns indicated that ovalbumin was surprisingly not incorporated in glutenins by covalent bond, whereas size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography showed that glutenin macropolymer content in glutenins increased slightly. Furthermore, dynamic rheology experiments indicated ovalbumin led to a decrease inG' andG '' of dough. Based on molecular dynamic simulation and SDS-PAGE results, it was inferred that ovalbumin was not hydrolyzed by endopeptidases during dough fermentation and crosslinked to gluten proteins during steaming. Finally, ovalbumin improved maximum dough height (Hm) during dough development and specific volume of Chinese steamed bread.

AB The by-products of rice milling (BRM), which are predominately rice bran, are a potential source of soluble protein that has been underexploited due to difficulties in extraction. Significant advances have been made understanding how protein content changes with degree of milling (DOM) at the laboratory scale. However, these results cannot be compared due to the lack of information on how DOM affects protein extractability in industrially produced BRM. The colorimetry or particle size analysis may estimate milling degree in industrial scale, and protein extractability changes due to a series of abrasive milling passes. Both colorimetry and particle size could differentiate the industrial abrasive passes and correlated with the amount of bran/protein present. Both the 1st and 2nd pass of milling were suitable sources for the extraction. While the relative amount of protein extracted in each fraction changed, the protein profile of the major fractions was conserved between mill passes.

AB Nine GtfB-like 4,6-alpha-glucanotransferases (4,6-alpha-GTs) (represented by GtfX of L. aviarius subsp. aviarius DSM 20655) were identified to show distinct characteristics in conserved motifs I-IV. In particular, the "fingerprint" Tyr in motif III of these nine GtfB-type 4,6-alpha-GTs was found to be replaced by a Trp. In L. aviarius subsp. aviarius DSM20655, a second GtfB-like protein (GtfY), containing the canonical GtfB Tyr residue in motif III, was located directly upstream of GtfX. Biochemical characterization revealed that both GtfX and GtfY showed GtfB-like 4,6-alpha-GT activity, cleaving (alpha 1 -> 4) linkages and catalyzing the synthesis of (alpha 1 -> 6) linkages. Nonetheless, they differ in product specificity; GtfY only synthesizes consecutive (alpha 1 -> 6) linkages, yielding linear alpha-glucan products, but GtfX catalyzes the synthesis of (alpha 1 -> 6) linkages predominantly at branch points (22%) rather than in linear segments (10%). The highly branched a-glucan produced by GtfX from amylose V is resistant to digestion by alpha-mylase, offering great potential as dietary fibers.

AB A simple, fast, green, sensitive and selective ultrasonic assisted deep eutectic solvent liquid-phase microextraction technique was used for preconcentration and extraction of cadmium (Cd) in water and food samples by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). In this technique, a synthesized reagent (Z)-N-(3,5-diphenyl-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenyl-2H-pyrrol-2-imine (Azo) was used as a complexing agent for Cd. The main factors effecting the pre-concentration and extraction of Cd such as effect of pH, type and composition of deep eutectic solvent (DES), volume of DES, volume of complexing agent, volume of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and ultrasonication time have been examined in detail. At optimum conditions the value of pH and molar ratio of DES were found to be 6.0 and 1: 4 (ChCl: Ph), respectively. The detection limit (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), relative standard deviation (RSD) and preconcentration factor (PF) were observed as 0.023 ng L-1, 0.161 ng L-1, 3.1% and 100, correspondingly. Validation of the developed technique was observed by extraction of Cd in certified reference materials (CRMs) and observed results were successfully compared with certified values. The developed procedure was practiced to various food, beverage and water samples.

AB Information on the physicochemical variability in dry bean seeds from different varieties grown over distinct crop years is lacking. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between the environment and the seed characteristics of 25 edible dry bean varieties and to expand the knowledge on their proximate composition, starch digestibility, solvent retention capacity, and pasting and thermal properties. The impact of bean genotype (25 varieties), growing environment (two crop years), and powder particle size (<= 0.5 mm, <= 1.0 mm) was investigated. Statistical differences (P > 0.05) in seed characteristics and in starch, amylose and protein contents were found among the 25 varieties. Unique pasting and thermal properties were observed, and genotype and particle size greatly affected these properties. The accumulated information can be used in breeding programs to select bean lines possessing unique properties for food ingredients while increasing the market value of the crop and enhancing human health.

AB Methylation of promoter CpG islands may suppress the function of miRNAs by inhibiting their expression. Our work analyzes the role of promoter methylation in altering the expression of 12 miRNAs associated with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC): miR-124-3p, -125b-5p, -127-5p, -129-5p, -132-3p, -137, -148a-3p, -191-5p, -193a-5p, -203a, -339-3p, and -375. The role of methylation in the deregulation of these miRNAs has not been previously assessed in a representative set of EOC samples. Using 76 paired (tumor/matched normal) ovarian samples and methylation-specific PCR, we demonstrated significant aberrations in the methylation patterns of 11 miRNA genes and identified 8 novel hypermethylated miRNA genes (MIR-124-1, -124-2, -124-3, -127, -132, -137, -193A, and -339) as well as one hypomethylated miRNA gene (MIR-191). Quantitative PCR on a subset of 29 paired EOC samples allowed us to establish a strong correlation between methylation status and alterations in expression levels for all 12 miRNAs studied. These findings demonstrate the functional role of aberrant methylation of examined miRNA genes in EOC. Moreover, we showed a significant association of hypermethylation of 10 miRNA genes (MIR-124-2, -124-3, -125B-1, -127, -129-2, -137, -193A, -203A, -339, -375) with EOC metastasis to lymph nodes, peritoneum, and distant organs. Interestingly, MIR-203A and MIR-375 were hypermethylated only in disseminated ovarian tumors, implying that non-suppressor miR-203a and miR-375 have anti-metastatic properties. Hypermethylation of 10 miRNA genes in EOC metastases was validated using an additional sample set of 13 primary tumors and matched peritoneal metastases. Together, these results show the impact of aberrant methylation on deregulation of 12 miRNAs in EOC, the involvement of 10 hypermethylated miRNA genes in metastasis (including peritoneal macro-metastases), and suggest novel potential biomarkers.

AB Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative condition characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra. MPP + as a dopaminergic neurotoxin induces many parkinsonian-like symptoms in cell culture. MicroRNAs are noncoding RNAs which their deregulation participates in neurodegeneration by affecting most of the mechanisms responsible for neurodegenerative diseases. Differentiated PC12 cells impaired by MPP + were served as an in vitro model of PD. The aim of present research is to evaluate expression of several miRNAs and possible target genes in MPP + -treated differentiated PC12 cells. PC12 cells were differentiated by induction of NGF. Neurite outgrowth was quantified using image analysis software. MTS assay was served to assess cell viability. DCFH-DA assay and Annexin v staining were used to detect reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and apoptosis, respectively. An in-silico study was performed to make interaction analysis between selected mRNAs and microRNAs. The expression levels of microRNAs and target genes were examined by RT-qPCR. NGF induced differentiation led to a substantial increase in neurite lengths means and percentage of the neurite-bearing cells. NGF-differentiated PC12 cells substantially expressed TH and retained their dopaminergic characteristic after differentiation. NGF treatment enhanced TH gene expression. MPP + exposure caused loss of cell viability and induced apoptosis and ROS overproduction. SIRT1, BCL2, and BDNF were down-regulated after MPP + -treatment. In contrast, MPP + toxicity significantly caused up-regulation in miR-34a, miR-141, and miR-9. The present study showed altered levels of selected microRNAs in response to MPP + for the first time, suggesting that perturbed expression of them may contribute to the PD-related pathogenic processes, probably by affecting the expression of BCL2, BDNF, and SIRT1 as potential targets.

AB The Junggar Basin is a potential replacement area of coalbed methane (CBM) development in China. To improve the efficiency of CBM exploration, we investigated CBM accumulation and dissipation patterns of coal profiles located in the northwestern, southern, eastern, and central Junggar Basin based on the following criteria: burial depth, hydrogeological zone, CBM origin, CBM phase, and CBM migration type. We identified four types of CBM accumulation patterns: (1) a self-sourcing CBM pattern containing adsorbed gas of biogenic origin from shallow-depth coal within a weak runoff zone; (2) an endogenic migration pattern containing adsorbed gas of thermogenic origin from the medium and deep coals within a stagnant zone; (3) an exogenic migration pattern containing adsorbed gas of thermogenic origin from deep coal within a stagnant zone; and (4) an exogenic migration pattern containing adsorbed and free gas of thermogenic origin from ultra-deep coal within a stagnant zone. We also identified two types of CBM dissipation patterns: (1) shallow-depth coal within a runoff zone with mixed origin CBM; and (2) shallow and medium-deep coal seams with mixed origin CBM. CBM migration in low-rank coals was more substantial than that adsorbed in high-rank coal. CBM in shallow coal could easily escape, in the absence of closed structures or hydrogeological seals. CBM reservoirs occurred in deep coal where oversaturated gas may accumulate. Future exploration should focus on gas-water sealing structures in shallow coalbeds. CBM that occurred in adsorbed and free phases and other unconventional natural gas dominated by free gas in the coal stratum should be co-explored and co-developed.

AB Aridification of the Asian interior is one of the most significant paleoenvironmental events during the Cenozoic. However, continuous paleoclimatic records from desert interiors are scarce because of the lack of outcrops, erosion and discontinuous sediment accumulation. Here we report a multi-proxy climatic record for the last similar to 3.55 Ma from paleomagnetically-dated drilling core WEDP01 from the central Tengger Desert, which is one of the most important sediment source areas for Northern Hemisphere atmospheric dust and the Chinese Loess Plateau. Analysis of grain-size components indicates the onset of continuous dust deposition at 2.6 Ma and desert formation at 0.9 Ma. In addition, analysis of major element content and sediment color reveals a stepwise process of increasing aridification and significant cooling in the Tengger Desert area. Simultaneous aridification events in northwest China during the Quaternary were probably induced by the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. Northern Hemisphere glaciation may have been another important factor for Asian aridification; meanwhile, the increased dust emission from sources such as the Tengger Desert may provide a positive feedback mechanism for global cooling.

AB The mantle sections of four Neotethyan ophiolite bodies viz. Nagaland, Manipur, Andaman island and Rutland island lie along the eastern margin of the Indian plate. Among the at least two existing ophiolite belts in this region, all of these four ophiolite bodies belong to the western ophiolite belt. The major and trace element signatures of the constituent minerals of mantle peridotites of these ophiolites suggest that the samples from Nagaland, Manipur bear unequivocal signatures of abyssal peridotites. The compositional spectrum observed in them is within the limit of anhydrous melting of a MORE mantle source under reasonable melting condition. The Andaman ophiolite although overall characterizes the same, however, some mantle peridotites from this ophiolite might have experienced a hydrous melting event. The Rutland samples are distinct, showing signatures attesting to their forearc origin. The compositional spectrum observed in Nagaland, Manipur and a group of Andaman samples are grossly similar with samples recovered from Philippine Sea basins. Accordingly, interpretation regarding the geotectonic setting for the origin of these ophiolites straddles between mid-ocean ridge (MOR) and back-arc. If they truly represent their origin at MOR setting then the plagiogranites in these places showing arc affinity likely represent a later arc-related event, without having much connotation to the age of these ophiolites. Alternatively this study establishes a back-arc origin of these ophiolites.

AB The Kuching Zone in West Sarawak consists of two different sedimentary basins, the Kayan and Ketungau Basins. The sedimentary successions in the basins are part of the Kuching Supergroup that extends into Kalimantan. The uppermost Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) to Lower Eocene Kayan Group forms the sedimentary deposits directly above a major unconformity, the Pedawan Unconformity, which marks the cessation of subduction-related magmatism beneath SW Borneo and the Schwaner Mountains, due to termination of the Paleo-Pacific subduction. The successions consist of the Kayan and Penrissen Sandstones and are dominated by fluvial channels, alluvial fans and floodplain deposits with some deltaic to tidally-influenced sections in the Kayan Sandstone. In the late Early or early Middle Eocene, sedimentation in this basin ceased and a new basin, the Ketungau Basin, developed to the east. This change is marked by the Kayan Unconformity. Sedimentation resumed in the Middle Eocene (Lutetian) with the marginal marine, tidal to deltaic Ngili Sandstone and Silantek Formation. Upsequence, the Silantek Formation is dominated by floodplain and subsidiary fluvial deposits. The Bako-Mintu Sandstone, a potential lateral equivalent of the Silantek Formation, is formed of major fluvial channels. The top of the Ketungau Group in West Sarawak is formed by the fluvially-dominated Tutoop Sandstone. This shows a transition of the Ketungau Group in time towards terrestrial/fluvially-dominated deposits.
   Paleocurrent measurements show river systems were complex, but reveal a dominant southern source. This suggests uplift of southern Borneo initiated in the region of the present-day Schwaner Mountains from the latest Cretaceous onwards. Additional sources were local sources in the West Borneo province, Mesozoic melanges to the east and potentially the Malay Peninsula. The Ketungau Group also includes reworked deposits of the Kayan Group. The sediments of the Kuching Supergroup are predominantly horizontal or dip with low angles and form large open synclines. Steep dips are usually restricted to faults, such as the Lupar Line.

AB The Huoshenmiao intrusion, which is located in the western domain of the Luanchuan ore district, comprises quartz diorite, monzogranite, and granite porphyry. LA-(MC)-ICPMS zircon U-Pb dating, whole-rock geochemistry, and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopes were conducted to constrain the timing of magmatism, and to reveal the petrogenesis and tectonic setting. Zircon U-Pb dating of the quartz diorite, monzogranite, and granite porphyry yielded ages of 150.3 +/- 0.6 Ma, 146.0 +/- 0.6 Ma, and 145.1 +/- 0.5 Ma, respectively, indicating emplacement of the intrusion took place in the Late Jurassic. The three petrofacies are characterized by arc-like trace-element distribution, enriched in large ion lithophile elements and light rare earth elements, and depleted in high field strength elements. The quartz diorite is characterized by relatively low SiO2 content (56.79-61.96%), high Mg-# (0.44-0.46), and Na2O-rich (Na2O/K2O = 0.95-1.43). However, the monzogranite and granite porphyry are characterized by relatively high SiO2 content (69.70-71.96%), low Mg-# (0.23-0.28), and K2O-rich (K2O/Na2O = 1.20-1.93). The epsilon(Nd)(t) values of the quartz diorite range from - 14.6 to -14.1 and the epsilon(Hf)(t) values range from - 19.6 to -14.8, with model ages ranging from 2.09 to 2.44 Ga. The monzogranite and granite porphyry have epsilon(Nd)(t) values ranging from -16.8 to -14.7 and epsilon(Hf)(t) values in the range of - 31.9 to -16.7, with model ages ranging from 2.13 to 3.21 Ga. The differences in elemental and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic characteristics suggest that the quartz diorite was derived from a different magma source from the monzogranite and granite porphyry. Based on these new data, we propose that the quartz diorite was derived from partial melting of an enriched lithospheric mantle that experienced metasomatism owing to dehydration of the subducted continental crust of the Yangtze Craton. The monzogranite and granite porphyry were derived from partial melting of the Taihua TTG and the enriched lithospheric mantle. Model calculations using Sr-Nd isotopic data suggest that 50-70% of enriched lithospheric mantle material would be required to generate the monzogranite and granite porphyry. We propose that the Huoshenmiao intrusion was most likely associate with two subduction events, and generated in a back-arc extensional setting related to the subduction of the Izanagi Plate beneath the Eurasian continental margin.

AB The Mesozoic lithospheric destruction of the North China Craton (NCC) in eastern China with a concomitant large-scale crustal exhumation has been widely accepted. However the specific timing, magnitude and rate of exhumation remain elusive. The widely outcropping episodes of Mesozoic granitoids in the Jiaodong Peninsula provide an excellent natural case for crustal exhumation research. Application and comparison of two Al-inhornblende barometers and experimental Qz-Ab-Or phase diagram indicate that oxygen fugacity could affect pressure estimation of granitoids and the Al-in-hornblende barometers derived from the AS95 (referring to Anderson and Smith, 1995) has the potential to estimate pressures of granitoids emplaced at 1-2 kbar. The QzAb-Or phase diagram can be used to constrain the emplacement pressures of granitoids on the premise of selecting suitable geochemical data. Our results demonstrate a rapid crustal exhumation event between similar to 160 and 115 Ma, i.e., approximately 10 km for the Jiaobei terrane and 7 km for the ultra-high pressure metamorphic terrane, reflecting heterogeneous exhumation possibly in response to the lithospheric destruction of the NCC.

AB In the East Qinling orogenic belt, central China, there are numerous Mo deposits with over 6 Mt Mo metal. The giant Nannihu, Shangfanggou and Yuchiling porphyry Mo deposits are hosted in porphyry stocks associated with the Heyu batholith, whereas the giant Donggou porphyry Mo deposit is hosted in a stock associated with the Taishanmiao batholith. Zircon grains from the Heyu batholith have concordant U-238/Pb-206 ages scattered from 150 +/- 3 to 130 +/- 2 Ma with an age interval of nearly 20 my., whereas ore-hosting granitic porphyry stocks from the Nannihu, Shangfanggou and Yuchiling deposits have Pb-206/U-238 ages ranging from 151 +/- 1 to 135 +/- 1 Ma, 143 +/- 1 to 132 +/- 1 Ma, and 143 +/- 5 to 131 +/- 5 Ma, respectively. It is likely that the Heyu batholith has a prolonged history of incremental assembly and the ore-bearing granitic porphyry stocks may have originated from the same magma reservoir and emplaced in different stages. Likewise, zircon grains from the Taishanmiao batholith have concordant U-238/Pb-206 ages spanning in a period from 130 +/- 2 to 111 +/- 3 Ma, whereas those from the Donggou granitic porphyry stock have U-238/Pb-206 ages ranging from 125 +/- 2 to 110 +/- 3 Ma, nearly coeval with the Taishanmiao batholith. The molybdenite Re-Os model ages for each deposit are coincident with relatively young zircon U-238/Pb-206 ages of the host stock, indicating that Mo mineralization is likely related to late-stage magmatism. Zircon grains from the batholiths and granitic porphyry stocks have epsilon(H)(f)(t) ranging from -10 to - 30, T-DM(2) ages from 1.6 to 2.5 Ga and delta O-18 from +5.0 to +8.7%s, which are taken to suggest the involvement of the subducted continental crust of the Yangtze Block in the source. We thus propose that the extensive Mo mineralization in the East Qinling porphyry Mo belt is genetically related to the prolonged granitic magmatism in the Late Mesozoic and a Mo-rich source that was related to the subducted continental crust of the Yangtze Block stagnating beneath the southern margin of the North China Craton.

AB The Jiaodong Peninsula at the southeastern periphery of the North China Craton (NCC) has undergone complex changes since the Mesozoic. A striking feature of the NCC is the widespread distribution of Late Mesozoic magmatic rocks, predominantly characterized by granitic intrusions. These igneous plutons are economically important due to their polymetallic mineralization and significant as geodynamic tracers of the regional tectonic evolution. Two representative Early Cretaceous granites (the Yashan and Yuangezhuang plutons) on the Jiaodong Peninsula were selected for multiple-thermochronometer studies to constrain a complete thermal history from their emplacement to near-surface conditions. We obtained biotite Ar-40/Ar-39 ages of two granites on the new generation Argus VI noble gas mass spectrometer. Two biotites registered identical Ar-40/Ar-39 plateau ages of similar to 117 Ma, which are consistent within the error with their zircon U-Pb ages. This suggested that the two granites were emplaced at the same time and cooled rapidly to about 300 degrees C. The single crystal zircon (U-Th)/He (ZHe) dating for the two samples gave weighted mean ages of 93.5 +/- 4.5 Ma and 93.3 +/- 5.0 Ma. Combined with previously published geochronological data and the thermal inversion of the zircon low temperature thermochronological data, three phases of rapid cooling were identified for the two studied plutons: (1) the Early Cretaceous (117-110 Ma); (2) the Late Cretaceous (100-90 Ma); and (3) the Early Tertiary (65-50 Ma). The Early Cretaceous phase of cooling occurred in a regional extensional regime on the NCC characterized by various extensional structures. The Late Cretaceous cooling is consistent with the third episode of the "Yanshan Movement", which caused a regional basin inversion event on the NCC. In comparison to the first two phases of rapid cooling, the Early Tertiary cooling was more gradual. This phase corresponded to a widely developed Eocene rift on the NCC and the reactivation of major boundary faults, such as the giant Tan-Lu Fault Zone and the Taihangshan Fault.

AB We present geochemical and age data for coeval basalt and rhyolite in the Yinshan Block, western North China Craton, to study the origin of the 'Daly Gap' in this bimodal volcanic suite. SHRIMP zircon U-Pb dating for felsic rocks and bulk rock Ar-40/Ar-38 dating for mafic rocks yield their ages of 107-133 Ma. The basalts show elevated abundances of incompatible elements with [La/Sm](N) = 2.65-3.54 and enriched Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic signatures (Sr-87/Sr-86(t) = 0.7054-0.7084, Nd-143/Nd-144(t) = 0.5119-0.5123, Hf-176/Hf-177(t) = 0.2824-0.2826), consistent with their derivation from low degree melting of previously metasomatized lithospheric mantle. The rhyolites display similar enrichment in alkalis and other incompatible elements, but have obvious Nb-Ta depletion. Combined with their more enriched Nd-Hf isotopic compositions (epsilon(Nd)(t) = -12 to -18, epsilon(Hf)(t) = - 2 to -14), these rhyolites are inferred to have been generated by mixing of the mantle-derived basaltic magma with felsic melts derived from lower continental crust anataxis induced by the basaltic magma. Furthermore, the extremely low Ba, Sr, Eu contents, high Rb/Sr ratios and unexpectedly high Sr-87/Sr-86 (0.7920-0.7159) in these felsic samples also suggests that their parental magma experienced protracted fractional crystallization of plagioclase (K-feldspar to a lesser extent) en route to the surface. This rock association and the unique geochemical characteristics of these volcanic rocks offer a new view on the petrogenesis of bimodal volcanism: the mafic rocks originated from partial melting of the ancient lithospheric mantle. Underplating of the basaltic magmas triggered melting of lower continental crust. The extensive fractional crystallization of the hybridized magma resulted in the highly fractionated rhyolites. This mechanism explains the "Daly Gap" exhibited in this rock association in a continental setting and also the observation that both the lithospheric mantle and crust in East China are thinner than that in West China.

AB The Guojialing and Aishan plutons in the northern Jiaobei Terrane represent the magmatic products of the lithospheric thinning of the North China Craton in the Early Cretaceous. The exhumation history of the terrane in response to the thinning process and its effect on the formation and preservation of coeval gold deposits remain poorly constrained. Granodiorites from the Guojialing pluton and monzogranites from the Aishan pluton contain zircon grains with U-Pb ages of ca. 130 Ma and ca. 116 Ma, respectively. Using the Al-in-hornblende barometry, the Guojialing and Aishan plutons had crystallization pressures of 3.2-5.4 kbar (similar to 12 km) and 1.5-2.6 kbar (similar to 5 km), respectively. Using the hornblende-plagioclase thermometry, the Guojialing and Aishan plutons had crystallization temperatures of 628-697 degrees C and 702-745 degrees C, respectively. Fluid inclusion microthermometric data show that auriferous quartz veins in the Daliuhang deposit formed at temperatures between 243 and 322 degrees C at a depth of 7-11 km which was similar to the emplacement depth of the Aishan pluton. These thermobarometric and geochronological data reveal similar to 7 km uplift between 130 Ma and 116 Ma, but negligible exhumation for the gold deposits after its formation until 116 Ma. Combining previous results, we envisage that the exhumation magnitude of the Guojialing intrusions were nearly the same in the wide area with slight differences between the core and margin of a single pluton. Numerous gold deposits in the Jiaobei Terrane formed during or after the late stage of rapid exhumation of granitoids, and were uplifted with similar depths to the Aishan pluton since ca. 116 Ma. The rapid exhumation of the Guojialing pluton was with the regional extension, and might be genetically associated with the intensive delamination of destabilized lithospheric root and dense residues.

AB Mineral compositions, clinopyroxene trace-element and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions, whole-rock major element and platinum group element (PGE) contents, and Re-Os isotopes are reported for peridotite xenoliths in the Cenozoic alkali basalts from Yangyuan, Hebei Province (China), in order to constrain the nature of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle beneath the central part of the North China Craton, and further to investigate the mechanism of decratonization. The xenoliths mainly consist of spinel lherzolites and minor spinel pyroxenites and spinel harzburgites with equilibration temperatures of 890-1060 degrees C. The olivine in these xenoliths have Mg number (%Fo) ranging from 88.2 to 91.6. According to the chemical characteristics, two groups of peridotites can be identified, i.e., group 1 are spinel lherzolites and spinel harzburgite that are depleted in Pt, Pd and Re (i.e., P-PGEs) relative to Os, Ir and Ru (i.e., I-PGEs) and their clinopyroxenes are depleted in light rare earth elements (LREEs), whereas, Group II are spinel lherzolites that are enriched in P-PGEs relative to I-PGEs and their clinopyroxenes are enriched in LREEs relative to HREEs. The spinel lherzolites have radiogenic Os-187/Os-188 ratios ranging from 0.1182 to 0.1262, whereas, the spinel harzburgites have relatively low Os-187/Os-188 ratios with Proterozoic model ages. Clinopyroxenes in the peridotite xenoliths have variable but relatively unradiogenic Sr (Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.7026-0.7046) and radiogenic Nd (epsilon(Nd) = + 2.0 to + 14.7) and Hf (epsilon(Hf) = + 8.8 to + 37.9) isotopic compositions. All these geochemical features indicate that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle beneath Yangyuan had experienced variable degrees of melt extraction and mantle metasomatism by the silicate melts represented by spinel pyroxenites. The spinel pyroxenites are enriched in LREEs and P-PGEs relative to HREEs and I-PGEs. Clinopyroxenes in pyroxenite xenoliths have high Sr-87/(86) Sr ratios of 0.7054-0.7063, negative epsilon(Nd) (-3.4 to -15.8) and eHf (- 2.0 to -22.0) values, and high Os-187/Os-188 ratios of 0.2196-0.3343, indicating that the silicate melts were derived from ancient lower continental crustal materials. Our data suggest that the lithospheric mantle beneath Yangyuan had been metasomatized by silicate melts derived from recycled ancient lower crust, indicating that decratonization of the North China Craton was possibly induced by delamination of the lower crust and lithospheric mantle.

AB The world-class giant gold province ( > 4000 t) in the Jiaodong Peninsula has attracted global attention and extensive studies for decades. However, most of the works have been focused on the western Zhaoyuan-Laizhou and eastern Muping-Rushan gold metallogenic belt, leaving the middle Penglai-Qixia belt largely unexplored. The Hushan gold deposit in the Penglai-Qixia belt shows a unique two-stage gold mineralization, i.e., an earlystage pyrite-sericite-quartz altered-rock type mineralization and a late-stage pyrite-pyrrhotite vein type mineralization. Hydrothermal monazite coexisting with Au-bearing pyrite is observed in the early-stage mineralization. The widespread "circular zoned" metasomatic relict structures indicate that monazite was formed by the strong interaction between (Ca, P, REE)-rich fluids and feldspars (plagioclase and K-feldspar). Therefore obtained in-situ U-Pb age of 120.0 +/- 3.1 Ma for the "pure" monazite without mineral inclusions (such as feldspars) can represent the timing of the early-stage gold mineralization. The in-situ monazite epsilon(Nd) (t) (t = 120 Ma) values vary from -20.6 to -18.4, well corresponding to Nd isotopes of the late Jurassic Linglong granite. It is inferred that the REE-rich components in the ore-forming fluids were extracted during the process of primary mineralizing fluids passing through the lower Linglong granite body, and that the Nd isotopic compositions were altered due to the strong fluid-rock interaction. In this regard, Linglong granite contributes some ore-forming materials to the mineralizing fluids during fluid-rock interaction.
   The early-stage altered-rock type gold mineralization indicates a compressional (closed) ore-forming system, whereas the late-stage pyrite-pyrrhotite vein type mineralization and the occurrences of fracture, geode and hole in the ore samples reflect an extensional (open) ore-forming system. The presence of barite and magnetite in the late-stage mineralization also suggests an increase of oxidation state during the process. Furthermore, pyrites in the late stage generally have lower delta S-34 values (5.69-6.98 parts per thousand, ay. = 6.47 parts per thousand) than pyrites in the early stage (delta S-34 values = 7.06-7.85 parts per thousand, ay. = 7.42 parts per thousand), which can also be well explained by the increase of oxidation state. Therefore, the Hushan gold deposit uniquely records a metallogenic environmental transition from compressional, reduced to extensional, oxidized at 120 Ma. In addition, the mineralizing fluids with higher oxidation state in the late-stage is supposed to superimpose on the early-stage mineralization, dissolve and rework previously crystalized pyrite to form the high-grade gold mineralization. Unlike the gold deposits in the western and eastern belts, the Hushan gold deposit temporally preserves two types of mineralization in one single deposit, as a response to regional stress field transition.

TI An effective neural model extracting document level chemical-induced
   disease relations from biomedical literature

   Convolutional neural network; Text mining
AB Since identifying relations between chemicals and diseases (CDR) are important for biomedical research and healthcare, the challenge proposed by BioCreative V requires automatically mining causal relationships between chemicals and diseases which may span sentence boundaries. Although most systems explore feature engineering and knowledge bases to recognize document level CDR relations, feature learning automatically is limited only in a sentence.
   In this work, we proposed an effective model that automatically learns document level semantic representations to extract chemical-induced disease (CID) relations from articles by combining advantages of convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network. First, to purposefully collect contexts, candidate entities existing in multiple sentences of an article were masked to make the model have ability to discern candidate entities and general terms. Next, considering the contiguity and temporality among associated sentences as well as the topic of an article, a hierarchical network architecture was designed at the document level to capture semantic information of different types of text segments in an article. Finally, a softmax classifier performed the CID recognition.
   Experimental results on the CDR corpus show that the proposed model achieves a good overall performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Although only using two types of embedding vectors, our approach can perform well for recognizing not only intra-sentential but also inter-sentential CID relations.

ID INFORMATION; VALIDATION; GUIDELINES; TRIALS
AB Introduction: Data audits within clinical settings are extensively used as a major strategy to identify errors, monitor study operations and ensure high-quality data. However, clinical trial guidelines are non-specific in regards to recommended frequency, timing and nature of data audits. The absence of a well-defined data quality definition and method to measure error undermines the reliability of data quality assessment. This review aimed to assess the variability of source data verification (SDV) auditing methods to monitor data quality in a clinical research setting.
   Material and methods: The scientific databases MEDLINE, Scopus and Science Direct were searched for English language publications, with no date limits applied. Studies were considered if they included data from a clinical trial or clinical research setting and measured and/or reported data quality using a SDV auditing method.
   Results: In total 15 publications were included. The nature and extent of SDV audit methods in the articles varied widely, depending upon the complexity of the source document, type of study, variables measured (primary or secondary), data audit proportion (3-100%) and collection frequency (6-24 months). Methods for coding, classifying and calculating error were also inconsistent. Transcription errors and inexperienced personnel were the main source of reported error. Repeated SDV audits using the same dataset demonstrated - 40% improvement in data accuracy and completeness over time. No description was given in regards to what determines poor data quality in clinical trials.
   Conclusions: A wide range of SDV auditing methods are reported in the published literature though no uniform SDV auditing method could be determined for "best practice" in clinical trials. Published audit methodology articles are warranted for the development of a standardised SDV auditing method to monitor data quality in clinical research settings.

AB Evidence-based medicine is the most prevalent paradigm adopted by physicians. Clinical practice guidelines typically define a set of recommendations together with eligibility criteria that restrict their applicability to a specific group of patients. The ever-growing size and availability of health-related data is currently challenging the broad definitions of guideline-defined patient groups. Precision medicine leverages on genetic, phenotypic, or psychosocial characteristics to provide precise identification of patient subsets for treatment targeting. Defining a patient similarity measure is thus an essential step to allow stratification of patients into clinically meaningful subgroups. The present review investigates the use of patient similarity as a tool to enable precision medicine. 279 articles were analyzed along four dimensions: data types considered, clinical domains of application, data analysis methods, and translational stage of findings. Cancer-related research employing molecular profiling and standard data analysis techniques such as clustering constitute the majority of the retrieved studies. Chronic and psychiatric diseases follow as the second most represented clinical domains. Interestingly, almost one quarter of the studies analyzed presented a novel methodology, with the most advanced employing data integration strategies and being portable to different clinical domains. Integration of such techniques into decision support systems constitutes and interesting trend for future research.

AB This paper presents a practical algorithm for constructing high order discontinuous Galerkin spectral element methods (DGSEM) on mixed triangular and quadrilateral grids. The traditional DGSEM belongs to the collocation-type nodal discontinuous Galerkin method which is computationally efficient on one-dimensional and tensor-product grids. This work generalizes DGSEM to triangular grids using symmetric quadrature points in sphere close packed arrangement. The dispersion and dissipation analysis shows that the scheme is stable for linear problems on triangles. A problem independent limiting procedure is proposed for capturing the shock waves. The main components are a modified KXRCF shock detector, a smoothness indicator and a high-resolution WENO limiter based on candidate polynomials constructed by newly developed projection approach. The implementation of the DGSEM on the mixed grids is also presented. Numerical examples on triangular and mixed grids verify the scheme's high order accuracy and robustness in computing inviscid and viscous compressible flows. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Hydrological and non-point source pollution (H/NPS) predictions in ungagged basins have become the key problem for watershed studies, especially for those large-scale catchments. However, few studies have explored the comprehensive impacts of rainfall data scarcity on H/NPS predictions. This study focused on: 1) the effects of rainfall spatial scarcity (by removing 11%-67% of stations based on their locations) on the H/NPS results; and 2) the impacts of rainfall temporal scarcity (10%-60% data scarcity in time series); and 3) the development of a new evaluation method that incorporates information entropy. A case study was undertaken using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in a typical watershed in China. The results of this study highlighted the importance of critical-site rainfall stations that often showed greater influences and cross-tributary impacts on the H/NPS simulations. Higher missing rates above a certain threshold as well as missing locations during the wet periods resulted in poorer simulation results. Compared to traditional indicators, information entropy could serve as a good substitute because it reflects the distribution of spatial variability and the development of temporal heterogeneity. This paper reports important implications for the application of Distributed Hydrological Models and Semi-distributed Hydrological Models, as well as for the optimal design of rainfall gauges among large basins.

AB We develop a semi-analytical model to calculate the entry pressure in rough capillaries based on an energy balance principle and wetting theory on rough surfaces. During the drainage process, we assume fluids form arc menisci at corners of capillary cross-sections depending on the apparent angle, and that there is a wetting phase film adsorbed on the rough surface depending on the wetting condition. A Logistic model is proposed to explain the contact angle dependence on the structure of rough surfaces. Then the capillary entry pressure is calculated by extended MS-P (Mayer, Stowe and Princen) method. We verify the model using the pseudopotential Lattice Boltzmann model and obtain good agreement between the analytical and simulated pressures. Taking capillaries with triangular sections with pillar pillar-type rough surfaces as example, we discuss how rough structures and contact angles influence capillary behaviors. The results reveal that both the wetting phase saturation and entry pressure of rough capillaries are larger than those in smooth capillaries under the same conditions. Moreover, the entry pressure is not sensitive to the roughness factor under strong wetting conditions and is much more sensitive to the pillar asperity height than the other structure parameters.

AB Evaluating the reliability of satellite and reanalysis precipitation products is critical but challenging over ungauged or poorly gauged regions. The Triple Collocation (TC) method is a reliable approach to estimate the accuracy of any three independent inputs in the absence of truth values. This study assesses the uncertainty of three types of independent precipitation products, i.e., satellite-based, ground-based and model reanalysis over Mainland China using the TC method. The ground-based data set is Gauge Based Daily Precipitation Analysis (CGDPA). The reanalysis data set is European Reanalysis Agency Reanalysis Product (ERA-interim). The satellite based products include five mainstream satellite products. The comparison and evaluation are conducted at 0.25 and daily resolutions from 2013 to 2015. First, the effectiveness of the TC method is evaluated in South China with dense gauge network. The results demonstrate that the TC method is reliable because the correlation coefficient (CC) and root mean square error (RMSE) derived from TC are close to those derived from ground observations, with only 9% and 7% mean relative differences, respectively. Then, the TC method is applied in Mainland China, with special attention paid to the Tibetan Plateau (TP) known as the Earth's third pole with few ground stations. Results indicate that (1) The overall performance of IMERG is better than the other satellite products over Mainland China, followed by 3B42V7, CMORPH-CRT and PERSIANN-CDR. (2) In the TP, CGDPA shows the best overall performance over gauged grid cells, however, over ungauged regions, IMERG and ERA interim slightly outperform CGDPA with similar RMSE but higher mean CC (0.63, 0.61, and 0.58, respectively). It highlights the strengths and potentiality of remote sensing and reanalysis data over the TP and reconfirms the cons of the inherent uncertainty of CGDPA due to interpolation from sparsely gauged data. The study concludes that the TC method provides not only reliable cross-validation results over Mainland China but also a new perspective for comparatively assessing multi-source precipitation products, particularly over poorly gauged regions such as the TP.

AB Sulphur plays a critical role in the biogeochemistry of wetlands. SO42- is the sulphur form that is most commonly assimilated by plants, and it is the medium of sulphur transformation in wetland ecosystems. The Caohai wetland is an important ecosystem on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, SW China, and karst water is the most important water source in this wetland. In this study, the compositions of multiple isotopes (delta(SSO4)-S-34 and delta(OSO4)-O-18) were measured in groundwater, river water and wetland water in the Caohai catchment to elucidate the solute sources and behaviours of sulphate. The results suggest that SO42- in groundwater is mainly derived from sulphide oxidation. Groundwater contributes a significant amount of sulphate to river water, and it is the main sulphate source of wetland water during the high-flow season. In contrast, rain water is the main sulphate source of wetland water during the low-flow season due to the reduction in groundwater recharge. These data indicate that groundwater is not only an important water source in the karst-dominated wetland catchment but also provides pathways by which sulphate is transported to the wetland. In addition, due to the effects of dissimilatory sulphate reduction in the wetland, the sulphate isotope composition in wetland water was higher than those in the groundwater and inflowing rivers, which indicates that biogeochemical processes in wetland ecosystems influence the sulphate content and composition in karst water.

AB As an extension of our recent study (Li et al. Taylor dispersion in wind-driven current. Journal of Hydrology 555, 697-707), an analytical study based on spatial concentration moments is performed on contaminant transport in a gravity induced open channel flow under wind effect. The zeroth to the fourth order spatial concentration moments are derived to describe the temporal evolution of spatial concentration distribution, fitted by the fourth order Hermite polynomials. In initial stage, convection dominates the contaminant transport, leading to a large non-uniformity of vertical concentration. As time passes, the contaminant transport gradually evolves to an asymptotic pattern following a diffusion-like model of Taylor dispersion. The combined influence of gravity and wind effect on contaminant transport is investigated: the tailwind effect will accelerate the development of Taylor dispersion as well as the transport of contaminant, while the conveyance capacity is weakened in a headwind circumstance.

AB Under the impact of intensive anthropogenic activities and in the context of global climate change, the hydromorphological processes of most lakes around the world have changed dramatically. Here, based on hydrologic and topographic data, we analyzed secular variations in hydromorphological characteristics and their influencing factors at Dongting Lake, the second-largest freshwater lake in China. The entire time series (1951-2014) was divided into four subperiods based on the anthropogenic modifications of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River, including the construction of the Lower Jingjiang Cutoff Project and the operation of the Gezhou Dam (GD) and the Three Gorges Dam (TGD). The results indicated that there were obvious stepwise decreasing trends in the annual water discharge and suspended sediment discharge (SSD) from 1951 to 2014. Seasonal differences in water discharge and SSD over the recent 60 years exhibited a tendency of "less flooding during the flood season and more drying during the dry season". Meanwhile, the deposition-erosion budget of Dongting Lake shifted from a deposition rate of 120 x 10(6) t/yr from 1951 to 2003 to an erosion rate of 2 x 10(6) t/yr with the serious degradation of the Ouchi and Xiangjiang deltas after 2003. The hydrological processes of Dongting Lake are dominated by different anthropogenic activities at different stages. The Jingjiang Cutoff Project is the main driver of the decreases in water discharge and SSD from 1967 to 1980. The operation of the GD along the Changjiang River and other reservoirs, as well as land-use changes in the Dongting Lake basin, should be responsible for the hydrological variations from 1981 to 2003. The high sediment retention rate, geometric adjustment of the channel, and flow regulation induced by the operation of the TGD are the main drivers for the hydromorphological variations in Dongting Lake in 2004-2014.

AB The preceding and succeeding precipitation (P-S-P) of a precipitation extreme often contribute to flooding initiated by the extreme event itself. In this study, the concept of event-based extreme precipitation (EEP), defined as a precipitation event (daily precipitation >= 1 mm for successive days) having at least one daily precipitation extreme (daily precipitation a the 99th percentile), is proposed to consider P-S-P of daily extreme precipitation. Further, the time distribution patterns, trends, and return levels of EEPs across China are analyzed based on a 0.5 x 0.5 degrees gridded precipitation dataset covering 1961-2016. The data demonstrate the EEP concept, that multi day EEP with daily extreme precipitation occurring late in the event is predominant in China except for the Northwest where single-day EEP prevails. Over west China, EEP is increasing and becomes more temporally concentrated. In the lower Lantsang River, along the southeast coastline and on the Hainan Island, the 20- and 50-yr return levels of EEP would exceed 300 and 400 mm, respectively. Moreover, global warming possibly induces more single-day EEPs in the Northwest. The EEP concept may help guide attempts to manage extreme precipitation on event basis, which is particularly useful for regions characterized by long-lasting extreme precipitation.

AB This study monitored four geothermal groundwater (TW) wells (Suanbo, Yuseong, Deoksan, and Seokmodo), four carbonated groundwater (CW) springs (Chojeong, Bugang, Shin, and Bangadari) and shallow groundwater (GW) in order to interpret the carbonating process from the seepage of CO2. In a bid to figure out the carbonated reservoir where CO2 mixing occurs, the CW samples represent the condition of the final carbonated water as natural analogues. The initial fresh water can be assumed to be the following depth: the deep aquifer with 300-700 m below the surface level (b.s.l) and the shallow aquifer to be below 300 m b.s.l. The pairs of hydrogen (82H) and oxygen (8180) isotopes indicated that all the groundwater samples had been recharged from meteoric water at various heights. The Delta 14C data of the TW samples present residence time from 1980 +/- 30 to 6400 +/- 30 years BP (before present) and the delta 13C data of dissolved inorganic carbon in the CW distributed from - 3 to -10460 range implying the mantle degassing effects. Regardless of seasonal variations, the TW samples and the CW samples were shown to be the Na-HCO3 type and the Ca-HCO3 type, respectively, indicating these aquifers remain in closed conditions. Based on the chalcedony geothermometer results, the carbonated reservoir of the CW samples were estimated to range between 43.08 and 83.13 degrees C, which were paired with the average temperature of the TW sites. In turn, the reservoir depth estimations taken by multiplying temperatures by geothermal gradients were estimated to range between 1.34 km and 3.90 km. Meanwhile, the in-situ data of the CW sites were estimated to range between 3.8 and 18.7 degrees C and between 263.7 and 488.7 mV of redox potential of oxidizing condition, which means there are the possibilities of shallow carbonated reservoir. In order to delineate the hydrochemical changes of the fresh groundwater during carbonation at a deep reservoir and a shallow reservoir, the PHREEQC modeling was conducted with 0.0001-10 mol L - 1 of CO2 mixing. As the CO2 concentrations increased, the TW and the GW displayed different ionic variations but the inland groundwater identically moved to the Ca-HCO3 type. The coastal TW can be reflecting the carbonation process of the coastal AZMI section, containing large quantities of salts. The carbonation of these samples is triggered by 0.01 mol L -1 of CO2 introduced into the reservoir but it still retained the Na-Cl water type despite a Log PCO2 of over - 0.5. The study results imply that there can be deep reservoirs and shallow reservoirs responsible for developing carbonated groundwater. It will be useful to estimate hydrochemical variations of groundwater resulting from the natural-artificial CO2 leakage.

AB This study aims at developing an inexact interval-valued triangular fuzzy based multi-attribute preference model (IVTF-MAPM) method for supporting the selection of remediation strategies of groundwater remediation. The introduction of interval-valued triangular fuzzy parameters into the attributes makes it possible for dealing with multiple uncertainties existing in many real-world cases, considering more possible values and expressing the decision making information more precisely. A attribute system which consists of fifteen remediation alternatives with respect to ten attributes in each period were taken into consideration assessment of the technologies for groundwater remediation. The pairwise comparisons between the alternatives were expressed by the valued preference model and the weights of the attributes were scored by interval Analytic Hierarchy Process. After the modeling formulation, a chlorhydrocarbons-contaminated groundwater management system was provided to demonstrate the applicability of the developed method. Final results showed that A14, A3, A9 and Al were placed at the top ranking levels for 5-, 10-, 15- and 20-years of remediation, respectively. Compared to the results conducted form FMAPM and MAPM, it is indicated that the significant impact of multiple uncertainties existing in the system is specified.

AB Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes intrinsically lead to various hydrological impacts especially on the outflow rate of the watersheds. This research investigated LULC changes and its effect on outlet runoff by detecting LULC changes location and severity via an inverse method for the Little River Watershed, USA. For this purpose, the Clark's conceptual Rainfall-Runoff model was applied to the delineated sub-watersheds of the basin to generate different outflows by altering the Storage Coefficient (SC) of the model for each sub-watershed as the representative of LULC. Then, the relation between SC values and outflow time series was simulated by Artificial Intelligence (AI) based models of artificial neural network and least square support vector machine. In this way, in order to ignore redundant information and reduce the dimension of input vector, Wavelet-Entropy (WE) values of the outflow sub-series were computed and used as the inputs of the AI model to compute SCs of the sub-watersheds as the outputs. The trained multi-output AI model as an inverse method could be then used to predict the SC values (as representative of LULC) of the sub-watersheds using the observed time series of runoff at the outlet. The obtained results showed that the proposed inverse method could reliably detect not only the location but also the severity of LULC changes by prediction of SC values in the coming future years. For validation of the method, a comparison was also performed between the obtained results and recorded changes via normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land use classification, extracted from Landsat images. The comparison approved the ability of the proposed method for LULC change detection in a way that deforestation and cropland increasing of the sub-watersheds from 1990 to 2013 were aligned with the SC reduction e.g., 26% decrease of SC for downstream sub-watershed versus 53% decrease and 21% increase of forest and crop lands, respectively.

AB Mechanical thermal dispersion has often been neglected or underestimated in the simulation of heat transport in porous media, e.g., by using zero or the default value in simulators, or by using the scaling law for solute dispersivity as a thermal dispersivity value. However, large amounts of water usually injected in groundwater heat pump (GWHP) systems may increase the groundwater flow velocity much faster than natural flow and thus change the importance of mechanical dispersion in heat transport. In this study, to investigate the effects of water injection on the flow field, thermal dispersion coefficient, and associated heat transport process, a laboratory experiment using two different heat sources as tracers was performed at various background flow velocities (Re < 0.52). The analysis results from analytical and numerical models indicate that injected water increases both flow velocities and thermal dispersion coefficients, especially near the injection well, and thus makes the effect of mechanical dispersion on heat transport very important even at low background flow velocity. This result was also found in the field-based modeling results, but the radius of hydraulic and thermal effects was larger. In particular, thermal dispersivity on a field scale is known to increase depending on the scale of measurement and the degree of aquifer heterogeneity. Therefore, to ensure the efficiency and sustainability in field applications such as GWHP systems, it is necessary to evaluate site-specific thermal dispersivity through field experiments.

AB The feasibility of simulating the hydrological response of a grass swale to runoff inflows was examined using the hydrological model Mike SHE and the available input data from 12 irrigation events mimicking runoff from block rainfalls. The test swale channel had a trapezoidal cross-section, bottom slope of 1.5%, length of 30 m, and was built in loamy fine sand. The irrigation events consisted in releasing two equal constant inflows to the swale: a concentrated longitudinal flow at the upstream end and a distributed lateral inflow along the swale side slope adjacent to the contributing drainage area. The total inflows approximated runoff from two events with return periods of 2 months and 3 years, respectively, for durations of 30 min. Irrigation experiments were done for two states of the initial soil moisture, dry or wet antecedent moisture conditions (AMC). Mike SHE has been extensively used on catchments of various sizes, but rarely for small stormwater management facilities and their detailed topography investigated in this study. The latter application required high spatial and temporal resolutions, with computational cells of 0.2 x 0.2 m and time steps as short as 0.6 s to avoid computational instabilities. For dominant hydrological processes, the following computational options in Mike SHE were chosen: Soil infiltration - the van Genuchten equation, unsaturated zone flow - the one-dimensional Richards equation, and overland flow - the diffusive wave approximation of the St. Venant equations. For study purposes, the model was calibrated for single events representing one of four combinations of low and high inflows, and dry and wet AMC, and then applied to the remaining 11 events. This was complemented by calibration for two events, representing high inflow on wet AMC and low inflow in dry AMC. The goodness of fit was statistically assessed for observed and simulated peak flows, hydrograph volumes, Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiencies (NSE), and soil water content (SWC) in swale soil layers. The best fit (NSE > 0.8) was obtained for high inflows and wet AMC (i.e., when the primary swale function is flow conveyance); the least fit was noted for low inflows and dry AMC, when the primary swale function is flow attenuation. Furthermore, this observation indicates the overall importance of correct modelling of the soil infiltration. The effects of spatial variation of SWC on the swale discharge hydrograph could not be confirmed from simulation results, but high topographical accuracy was beneficial for reproducing well the locations of the observed water ponding. No significant increases in simulated SWC at 0.3 m or greater depths were noted, which agreed with field observations. Overall, the results indicated that Mike SHE was effective in process-oriented small-scale modelling of grass swale flow hydrographs.

AB Chaos theory is integrated with Multi-Gene Genetic Programming (MGGP) engine as a new hybrid model for river flow forecasting. This is to be referred to as Chaos-MGGP and its performance is tested using daily historic flow time series at four gauging stations in two countries with a mix of both intermittent and perennial rivers. Three models are developed: (i) Local Prediction Model (LPM); (ii) standalone MGGP; and (iii) Chaos-MGGP, where the first two models serve as the benchmark for comparison purposes. The Phase-Space Reconstruction (PSR) parameters of delay time and embedding dimension form the dominant input signals derived from original time series using chaos theory and these are transferred to Chaos-MGGP. The paper develops a procedure to identify global optimum values of the PSR parameters for the construction of a regression-type prediction model to implement the Chaos-MGGP model. The inter-comparison of the results at the selected four gauging stations shows that the Chaos-MGGP model provides more accurate forecasts than those of stand-alone MGGP or LPM models.

AB A number of previous studies have examined relations between groundwater levels and hydrologic and meteorological variables over parts of the glacial aquifer system, but systematic analyses across the entire U.S. glacial aquifer system are lacking. We tested correlations between monthly groundwater levels measured at 1043 wells in the U.S. glacial aquifer system considered to be minimally influenced by human disturbance and selected hydrologic and meteorological variables with the goal of extending historical groundwater records where there were strong correlations. Groundwater levels in the East region correlated most strongly with short-term (1 and 3 month) averages of hydrologic and meteorological variables, while those in the Central and West Central regions yielded stronger correlations with hydrologic and meteorological variables averaged over longer time intervals (6-12 months). Variables strongly correlated with high and low annual groundwater levels were identified as candidate records for use in statistical linear models as a means to fill in and extend historical high and low groundwater levels respectively. Overall, 37.4% of study wells meeting data criteria had successful models for high and (or) low groundwater levels; these wells shared characteristics of relatively higher local precipitation, higher local land-surface slope, lower amounts of clay within the surficial sediments, and higher base-flow index. Streamflow and base flow served as explanatory variables in about two thirds of both high- and low-groundwater-level models in all three regions, and generally yielded more and better models compared to precipitation and Palmer Drought Severity Index. The use of variables such as streamflow with substantially longer and more complete records than those of groundwater wells provide a means for placing contemporary groundwater levels in a longer historical context and can support site-specific analyses such as groundwater modeling.

   CONSTRUCTION; NETHERLANDS; STATISTICS
AB Low-lying coastal regions are often highly populated, constitute sensitive habitats and are at the same time exposed to challenging hydrological environments due to surface flooding from storm events and saltwater intrusion, which both may affect drinking water supply from shallow and deeper aquifers. Near the Wadden Sea at the border of Southern Denmark and Northern Germany, the hydraulic system (connecting groundwater, river water, and the sea) was altered over centuries (until the 19th century) by e.g. the construction of dikes and drains to prevent flooding and allow agricultural use. Today, massive saltwater intrusions extend up to 20 km inland. In order to understand the regional flow, a methodological approach was developed that combined: (1) a highly-resolved voxel geological model, (2) a similar to 1 million node groundwater model with 46 hydrofacies coupled to rivers, drains and the sea, (3) Tikhonov regularization calibration using hydraulic heads and average stream discharges as targets and (4) parameter uncertainty analysis. It is relatively new to use voxel models for constructing geological models that often have been simplified to stacked, pseudo-3D layer geology. The study is therefore one of the first to combine a voxel geological model with state-of-the-art flow calibration techniques. The results show that voxel geological modelling, where lithofacies information are transferred to each volumetric element, is a useful method to preserve 3D geological heterogeneity on a local scale, which is important when distinct geological features such as buried valleys are abundant. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that simpler geological models and simpler calibration methods do not perform as well. The proposed approach is applicable to many other systems, because it combines advanced and flexible geological modelling and flow calibration techniques. This has led to new insights in the regional flow patterns and especially about water cycling in the marsh area near the coast based on the ability to define six predictive scenarios from the linear analysis of parameter uncertainty. The results show that the coastal system near the Danish-German border is mainly controlled by flow in the two aquifers separated by a thick clay layer, and several deep high-permeable buried valleys that connect the sea with the interior and the two aquifers. The drained marsh area acts like a huge regional sink limiting submarine groundwater discharge. With respect to water balance, the greatest sensitivity to parameter uncertainty was observed in the drained marsh area, where some scenarios showed increased flow of sea water into the interior and increased drainage. We speculate that the massive salt water intrusion may be caused by a combination of the preferential pathways provided by the buried valleys, the marsh drainage and relatively high hydraulic conductivities in the two main aquifers as described by one of the scenarios. This is currently under investigation by using a salt water transport model.

TI Identification of watershed priority management areas under water

AB Targeting nonpoint source (NPS) pollution hot spots is of vital importance for placement of best management practices (BMPs). Although physically-based watershed models have been widely used to estimate nutrient emissions, connections between nutrient abatement and compliance of water quality standards have been rarely considered in NPS hotspot ranking, which may lead to ineffective decision-making. It's critical to develop a strategy to identify priority management areas (PMAs) based on water quality response to nutrient load mitigation. A water quality constrained PMA identification framework was thereby proposed in this study, based on the simulation-optimization approach with ideal load reduction (ILR-SO). It integrates the physically-based Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and an optimization model under constraints of site-specific water quality standards. To our knowledge, it was the first effort to identify PMAs with simulation-based optimization. The SWAT model was established to simulate temporal and spatial nutrient loading and evaluate effectiveness of pollution mitigation. A metamodel was trained to establish a quantitative relationship between sources and water quality. Ranking of priority areas is based on required nutrient load reduction in each sub-watershed targeting to satisfy water quality standards in waterbodies, which was calculated with genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed approach was used for identification of PMAs on the basis of diffuse total phosphorus (TP) in Lake Dianchi Watershed, one of the three most eutrophic large lakes in China. The modeling results demonstrated that 85% of diffuse TP came from 30% of the watershed area. Compared with the two conventional targeting strategies based on overland nutrient loss and instream nutrient loading, the ILR-SO model identified distinct PMAs and narrowed down the coverage of management areas. This study addressed the urgent need to incorporate water quality response into PMA identification and showed that the ILR-SO approach is effective to guide watershed management for aquatic ecosystem restoration.

AB Since the late 1990s, lakes in the southern Tibetan Plateau (TP) have shrunk considerably, which contrasts with the rapid expansion of lakes in the interior TP. Although these spatial trends have been well documented, the underlying hydroclimatic mechanisms are not well understood. Since 2013, we have carried out comprehensive water budget observations at Paiku Co, an alpine lake in the central Himalayas. In this study, we investigate water storage and lake level changes on seasonal to decadal time scales based on extensive in-situ measurements and satellite observations. Bathymetric surveys show that Paiku Co has a mean and maximum water depth of 41.1 m and 72.8 m, respectively, and its water storage was estimated to be 109.3 x 10(8) m(3) in June 2016. On seasonal scale between 2013 and 2017, Paiku Co's lake level decreased slowly between January and May, increased considerably between June and September, and then decreased rapidly between October and January. On decadal time scale, Paiku Co's lake level decreased by 3.7 +/- 0.3 m and water storage reduced by (10.2 +/- 0.8) x 10(8) m(3) between 1972 and 2015, accounting for 8.5% of the total water storage in 1972. This change is consistent with a trend towards drier conditions in the Himalaya region during the recent decades. In contrast, glacial lakes within Paiku Co's basin expanded rapidly, indicating that, unlike Paiku Co, glacial meltwater was sufficient to compensate the effect of the reduced precipitation.

ID WAVE-FORM RELAXATION; STATE; CONTEXT
AB In the context of hydrodynamic modeling, the use of 2D models is adapted in areas where the flow is not monodimensional (confluence zones, flood plains). Nonetheless the lack of field data and the computational cost constraints limit the extensive use of 2D models for operational flood forecasting. Multi-dimensional coupling offers a solution with ID models where the flow is mono-dimensional and with local 2D models where needed. This solution allows for the representation of complex processes in 2D models, while the simulated hydraulic state is significantly better than that of the full ID model. In this study, coupling is implemented between three ID sub-models and a local 2D model for a confluence on the Adour river (France). A Schwarz algorithm is implemented to guarantee the continuity of the variables at the 1D/2D interfaces while in situ observations are assimilated in the ID sub-models to improve results and forecasts in operational mode as carried out by the French flood forecasting services. An implementation of the coupling and data assimilation (DA) solution with domain decomposition and task/data parallelism is proposed so that it is compatible with operational constraints. The coupling with the 2D model improves the simulated hydraulic state compared to a global ID model, and DA improves results in 1D and 2D areas.

AB Soil moisture dynamics plays an active role in ecological and hydrological processes, and it depends on a large number of environmental factors, such as topographic attributes, soil properties, land use types, and precipitation. However, studies must still clarify the relative significance of these environmental factors at different soil depths and at different spatial scales. This study aimed: (1) to characterize temporal and spatial variations in soil moisture content (SMC) at four soil layers (0-40, 40-100, 100-200, and 200-500 cm) and three spatial scales (plot, hillslope, and region); and (2) to determine their dominant controls in diverse soil layers at different spatial scales over semiarid and semi-humid areas of the Loess Plateau, China. Given the high co-dependence of environmental factors, partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to detect relative significance among 15 selected environmental factors that affect SMC. Temporal variation in SMC decreased with increasing soil depth, and vertical changes in the 0-500 cm soil profile were divided into a fast-changing layer (0-40 cm), an active layer (40-100 cm), a sub-active layer (100-200 cm), and a relatively stable layer (200-500 cm). PLSR models simulated SMC accurately in diverse soil layers at different scales; almost all values for variation in response (R-2) and goodness of prediction (Q(2)) were > 0.5 and > 0.0975, respectively. Upper and lower layer SMCs were the two most important factors that influenced diverse soil layers at three scales, and these SMC variables exhibited the highest importance in projection (VIP) values. The 7-day antecedent precipitation and 7-day antecedent potential evapotranspiration contributed significantly to SMC only at the 0-40 cm soil layer. VIP of soil properties, especially sand and silt content, which influenced SMC strongly, increased significantly after increasing the measured scale. Mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration also influenced SMC at the regional scale significantly. Overall, this study indicated that dominant controls of SMC varied among three spatial scales on the Loess Plateau, and VIP was a function of spatial scale and soil depth.

AB Ensemble Kalman (EnKF) filtering is an established framework for large scale state estimation problems. EnKFs can also be used for state-parameter estimation, using the so-called "Joint-EnKF" approach. The idea is simply to augment the state vector with the parameters to be estimated and assign invariant dynamics for the time evolution of the parameters. In this contribution, we investigate the efficiency of the Joint-EnKF for estimating spatially-varying Manning's n coefficients used to define the bottom roughness in the Shallow Water Equations (SWEs) of a coastal ocean model.
   Observation System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) are conducted using the ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) model, which solves a modified form of the Shallow Water Equations. A deterministic EnKF, the Singular Evolutive Interpolated Kalman (SEIK) filter, is used to estimate a vector of Manning's n coefficients defined at the model nodal points by assimilating synthetic water elevation data. It is found that with reasonable ensemble size (O(10)), the filter's estimate converges to the reference Manning's field. To enhance performance, we have further reduced the dimension of the parameter search space through a Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion. We have also iterated on the filter update step to better account for the nonlinearity of the parameter estimation problem. We study the sensitivity of the system to the ensemble size, localization scale, dimension of retained KL modes, and number of iterations. The performance of the proposed framework in term of estimation accuracy suggests that a well-tuned Joint-EnKF provides a promising robust approach to infer spatially varying seabed roughness parameters in the context of coastal ocean modeling.

ID ENHANCED PREDICTIONS; FLOODS; DISCHARGE
AB Prediction of peak discharge of floods has attracted great attention for researchers and engineers. In present study, nine typical nonlinear mathematical models are established based on database of 40 historical dam failures. The first eight models that were developed with a series of regression analyses are purely empirical, while the last one is a semi-analytical approach that was derived from an analytical solution of dam-break floods in a trapezoidal channel. Water depth above breach invert (H-w), volume of water stored above breach invert (V-w), embankment length (E-l), and average embankment width (E-w) are used as independent variables to develop empirical formulas of estimating the peak outflow from breached embankment dams. It is indicated from the multiple regression analysis that a function using the former two variables (i.e., H-w and V-w) produce considerably more accurate results than that using latter two variables (i.e., E-L and E-w). It is shown that the semianalytical approach works best in terms of both prediction accuracy and uncertainty, and the established empirical models produce considerably reasonable results except the model only using E-l. Moreover, present models have been compared with other models available in literature for estimating peak discharge.

AB Pines in semi-arid mountain environments manage to survive and thrive despite the limited soil water, due to shallow soil depths, and overall water scarcity. This study aims to develop a method for computing soil evaporation, bedrock water uptake and transpiration from a natural, open forest, based on sap flow (Heat Ratio Method), soil moisture and meteorological observations. The water balance of individual trees was conceptualized with a geometric approach, using canopy projected areas and Voronoi (Thiesen) polygons. The canopy approach assumes that the tree's root area extent is equal to its canopy projected area, while the Voronoi approach assumes that the tree roots exploit the open area that is closer to the tree than to any other tree. The methodology was applied in an open Pinus brutia forest (68% canopy cover) in Cyprus, characterized by steep slopes and fractured bedrock, during two hydrologically contrasting years (2015 wet, 2016 dry). Sap flow sensors, soil moisture sensors, throughfall and stemflow gauges were installed on and around eight trees. Rainfall was 507 mm in 2015 and 359 mm in 2016. According to the canopy approach, the sum of tree transpiration and soil evaporation exceeded the throughfall in both years, which implies that the trees' bedrock water uptake exceeds the surface runoff and drainage losses. This indicated that trees extend their roots beyond the canopy-projected areas and the use of the Voronoi polygons captures this effect. According to the stand scale water balance, average throughfall during the two years was 81% of the rainfall. Transpiration was 61% of the rainfall in 2015, but only 32% in 2016. On the contrary, the soil evaporation fraction increased from 26% in 2015 to 35% in the dry year of 2016. The contribution of bedrock water to tree transpiration was 77% of rainfall in 2015 and 66% in 2016. During the summer months, trees relied 100% on the uptake of water from the fractured bedrock to cover their transpiration needs. Average monthly transpiration areas ranged between 0.1 mm d(-1) in October 2016 and 1.7 mm d(-1) in April 2015. This study shows that bedrock uptake could be an essential water balance component of semi-arid, mountainous pine forests and should be accounted for in hydrologic models.

AB Fluid flow through highly porous media is important in a variety of science and technology fields, including hydrology, chemical engineering, convections in porous media, and others. While many methods have been available to measure the permeability of tight solid materials, such as concrete and rock, the technique for measuring the permeability of highly porous media is limited (such as gravel, aggregated soils, and crushed rock). This study proposes a new simplified method for measuring the permeability of highly porous media with a permeability of 10(-8)-10(-4)m(2), using a Venturi tube to gauge the gas flowing rate through the sample. Using crushed rocks and glass beads as the test media, we measure the permeability and inertial resistance factor of six types of single-size aggregate columns. We compare the testing results with the published permeability and inertial resistance factor of crushed rock and of glass beads. We found that in a log-log graph, the permeability and inertial resistance factor of a single-size aggregate heap increases linearly with the mean diameter of the aggregate. We speculate that the proposed simplified method is suitable to efficiently test the permeability and inertial resistance factor of a variety of porous media with an intrinsic permeability of 10(-8)-10(-4)m(2).

AB Recent studies based on Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission suggested that groundwater has increased in central and southern parts of India. However, surface water, which is an equally important source of water in these semi-arid areas has not been studied yet. In the present study, the study areas were outlined based on trends in GRACE data followed by trend identification in surface water storages and checking the hypothesis of causality. Surface Water Extent (SWE) and Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) derived from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer -Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) respectively, are selected as proxies of surface water storage (SWS). Besides SWE and SSM, trend test was performed for GRACE derived terrestrial water storage (TWS) for the study areas named as R1, R2, GOR1 and KOR1. Granger-causality test is used to test the hypothesis that rainfall is a causal factor of the inter-annual variability of SWE, SSM and TWS. Positive trends were observed in TWS for R1, R2 and GOR1 whereas SWE and SSM show increasing trends for all the study regions. Results suggest that rainfall is the granger-causal of all the storage variables for R1 and R2, the regions exhibiting the most significant positive trends in TWS.

AB Reservoir operations significantly alter the hydrological regime of the downstream river and river-connected lake, which has far-reaching impacts on the lake ecosystem. To facilitate the management of lakes connected to regulated rivers, the following information must be provided: (1) the response of lake water levels to reservoir operation schedules in the near future and (2) the importance of different rivers in terms of affecting the water levels in different lake regions of interest. We develop an integrated modeling and analytical methodology for the water level management of such lakes. The data-driven method is used to model the lake level as it has the potential of producing quick and accurate predictions. A new genetic algorithm-based synchronized search is proposed to optimize input variable time lags and data-driven model parameters simultaneously. The methodology also involves the orthogonal design and range analysis for extracting the influence of an individual river from that of all the rivers. The integrated methodology is applied to the second largest freshwater lake in China, the Dongting Lake. The results show that: (1) the antecedent lake levels are of crucial importance for the current lake level prediction; (2) the selected river discharge time lags reflect the spatial heterogeneity of the rivers' impacts on lake level changes; (3) the predicted lake levels are in very good agreement with the observed data (RMSE <= 0.091 m; R-2 >= 0.9986). This study demonstrates the practical potential of the integrated methodology, which can provide both the lake level responses to future dam releases and the relative contributions of different rivers to lake level changes.

AB Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is increasingly used as a water management tool to enhance water availability and to improve water quality. Until now, however, the risk of fluoride release during MAR with low ionic strength injectate has not been recognised or examined. In this study we analyse and report the mobilisation of fluoride (up to 58 mu M and filterable reactive phosphorus (FRP) (up to 55 mu M) during a field groundwater replenishment experiment in which highly treated, deionised wastewater (average TDS 33 mg/L) was injected into a siliciclastic Cretaceous aquifer. In the field experiment, maximum concentrations, which coincided with a rise in pH, exceeded background groundwater concentrations by an average factor of 3.6 for fluoride and 24 for FRP. The combined results from the field experiment, a detailed mineralogical characterisation and geochemical modelling suggested carbonate-rich fluorapatite (CFA: Ca-10(PO4)(5)(CO3,F)F-2) to be the most likely source of fluoride and phosphate release. An anoxic batch experiment with powdered CFA-rich nodules sourced from the target aquifer and aqueous solutions of successively decreasing ionic strength closely replicated the field-observed fluoride and phosphate behaviour. Based on the laboratory experiment and geochemical modelling, we hypothesise that the release of fluoride and phosphate results from the incongruent dissolution of CFA and the simultaneous formation of a depleted layer that has hydrated di-basic calcium phosphate (CaHPO4 & MIDDOT;nH(2)O) composition at the CFA-water interface. Disequilibrium caused by calcium removal following breakthrough of the deionised injectate triggered the release of fluoride and phosphate. Given the increasing use of highly treated, deionised water for MAR and the ubiquitous presence of CFA and fluorapatite (Ca-10(PO4)(6)F-2) in aquifer settings worldwide, the risk of fluoride and phosphate release needs to be considered in the MAR design process.

AB To understand the structural origin of the significant improvement on the plasticity of Fe-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) through the replacement of Fe by Ni, the short-range order (SRO) and medium-range order (MRO) structures of Fe80-xNixP14B6 (x = 0, 20, 30, 40, 50 at.%) amorphous alloys are investigated by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation in the present work. It is found that the substitution of Ni for Fe causes the significant change in the local environment of B atoms. As the Ni replaces the Fe, the number of B-B bonding decreases, and the fraction of < 0 3 6 0 > polyhedron decreases and that of < 0 2 8 0 > polyhedron increases among the major B-centered VPs. Additionally, the average coordination number (CN) of the present Fe-NI-P-B amorphous alloys decreases with increasing the Ni content. The decrease of the number of B-B bonding and the average CN are conducive to plastic deformation, which may be responsible for the improvement on the plasticity of the present Fe-Ni-P-B amorphous alloys through the Ni addition. The bond pair analysis indicates that, with the increase of Ni content, the fraction of 15xx bond pair with a five-fold symmetry and the number of pentagons decrease, and that of 1431, 142x and 1311 bond pairs of non-fivefold symmetry increase in the present Fe-Ni-P-B amorphous alloys, indicating that the reduction of fivefold symmetrical SRO is benefit to the intrinsic plasticity. The MRO investigation indicates that, as increasing the substitution content of Ni for Fe, the vertex-shared connection increases and the edge-shared connection decreases, which result in the increase of cavity and boundary between the SRO atomic clusters, and thus will be conducive to the improvement of the plasticity of the present Fe-Ni-P-B amorphous alloys.

AB There is a need to develop new composite fabrics with improved thermal properties. Aerogels are highly porous materials with low thermal conductivities and can be used to develop new composites with standard nonwoven fabrics. In this study, a new composite of alginate aerogel with polyester (PET) nonwoven was synthesized by a sol-gel method. A needle punched PET nonwoven was soaked with an alginate solution and then immersed in an aqueous CaCl2 solution which resulted in the formation of a gel inside the PET nonwoven. The gel was dried with supercritical CO2 after solvent exchange with ethanol leading to alginate aerogel-PET nonwoven composite. The aerogels were porous and were in the form of blocks in between the PET fibers as evident from SEM images. The thermal properties of the composite were measured using a heat flow meter. The thermal diffusivity of the composite was significantly lower than the thermal diffusivity of the pure PET nonwoven. The composite also had a higher thermal resistance and also a higher tensile strength than the pure PET nonwoven. Experiments using a thermal imaging camera indicated that the heat flux in the composite is much lower than in pure PET nonwoven due to the presence of alginate aerogel. The results show that the new composite material is promising for use in thermal clothing applications.

AB Quaternary alkali borate glass matrix doped with CdO (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 mol%) have been prepared by using conventional melting and quenching technique. For these glass systems structural properties were investigated by using X-ray diffraction, FE-SEM, EDS, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy characterization techniques. X-ray diffraction pattern and FE-SEM studies confirms the amorphous nature of prepared oxide glass. The optical absorption studies were done by using UV-Vis spectroscopy technique at room temperature. The physical parameters of all the glass samples were evaluated with respect to the composition, such as bulk density (rho), average molar mass (M), molar volume (V-m), ionic concentration (N), interionic distance (r(i)). They exhibit the non-linearity supporting evidence for the borate glass network modification. Investigations of FTIR and Raman spectroscopy of prepared glass samples have been employed to confirm the role of oxides in the formation of glass network. These glasses are made up from converting [BO3] to [BO4] units without increasing the concentration of non-bridging oxygen. Experimental fraction of 4-coordinated boron atoms expressed by the parameter N-4 was calculated and represented with the addition of concentration of CdO (mol%). The optical absorption studies revealed that the average refractive index (n(av)), optical band gap energy (E-g) nonlinearly increases. The electronic polarizability and optical basicity of the oxide ion (alpha(O2-)), as function of refractive index and optical band gap energy were also examined.

AB Glasses and vitroceramics in the xCuO center dot(100-x)[4PbO(2)center dot Pb] composition, where x = 0-70% CuO were prepared by melt quenching method and were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), InfraRed (IR), UltraViolet-Visible (UV-Vis), Photoluminescence (PL) and Eletron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopies and measurements of Cyclic Voltammetry (CV). XRD and SEM data show that the samples with x <= 60 mol% CuO have vitreous structure. Increasing CuO content of these samples up to 70 mol% produces the formation of CuO nanoparticles with spherical morphology on the vitroceramic surface. IR data suggest that the accommodation of dopant in the host matrix will be realized considering the conversion of some [PbO6] and [PbO4] structural units into [PbO3] structural units and the intercalation of [CuOn] structural units. The EPR spectra offer information concerning the presence of the isolated Cu2+ ions located at sites with an axially distorted octahedral symmetry, coupled and/or clustered Cu+2 species. UV-Vis data reveal the presence of copper ions in the two valence states: Cu+1 and Cu2+ ions. As results, the gap energy value decreases and the effect of luminescence was quenched by increasing of CuO dopant levels.

AB The crystallization mechanisms for Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2-B2O3-BaO glass-ceramics were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under non-isothermal conduction. The activation energy and Avrami exponent of the glass-ceramics had been calculated by Kissinger method and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) method. Comparison of the measured DSC data with calculated curves at different heating rates using Sestak-Berggren (SB) model and Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) model revealed the commonly used JMAK was not a suitable kinetic model for this glass-ceramic. However, the empirical SB model was found to be acceptable for analyzing the kinetics of crystallization for the studied glass composition. This model matched well with the DSC curves, with slight deviations at the tails of the peaks. Furthermore, the crystalline phases and microstructure of samples sintered at 730 degrees C for 2 h were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The LiAlSi2O8 and LiAlSi3O8 constituted as the predominant phases in the studied glass-ceramic.

AB Cyclodipeptide synthases (CDPSs) use two aminoacyl-tRNAs to catalyze the formation of two peptide bonds leading to cyclodipeptides that can be further used for the synthesis of diketopiperazines. It was shown that CDPSs fall into two subfamilies, NYH and XYP, characterized by the presence of specific sequence signatures. However, current understanding of CDPSs only comes from studies of enzymes from the NYH subfamily. The present study reveals the crystal structures of three CDPSs from the XYP subfamily. Comparison of the XYP and NYH enzymes shows that the two subfamilies mainly differ in the first half of their Rossmann fold. This gives a structural basis for the partition of CDPSs into two subfamilies. Despite these differences, the catalytic residues adopt similar positioning regardless of the subfamily suggesting that the XYP and NYH motifs correspond to two structural solutions to facilitate the reactivity of the catalytic serine residue.

AB A new phosphor of La-3-3xEu3xGa4TiO14 (x = 0-0.1) was synthesized via the solid-state reaction. The structure refinements verified the pure trigonal structure. La3Ga4TiO14 has a self-activated white-luminescence at room temperature. This is special in comparison with the reported Ti-phosphors, which usually show the room-temperature quenched blue or yellow emissions. The near-UV and blue-light can efficiently excite La-3-3xEu3xGa4TiO14 (x = 0.01-0.1) showing the orange-red tunable luminescence with a dependence on Eu3+-contents. The experimental lamps were fabricated using LED-chips in combination with single phosphor of La-3-3xEu3xGa4TiO14 (x = 0, 0.03, 0.07) driven by 2 mA current. This is a promising candidate in solid-state lighting and displays. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Polyimide (PI) based composites filled by silver nanosheets (Ag NSs) were prepared by using in situ polymerization. The relationship between dielectric properties and micro-structure (matrix and interface) of the PI/Ag NSs composites was investigated. The interface characteristics between Ag NS and PI matrix were detected via X-ray scattering and diffraction technique. With Ag NSs content increasing (0-10 vol %), the dielectric permittivity of the composites increases from 3.18 to 4.55 at 100 Hz, during which the interface is gradually formed. As content is added continually (10-20 vol%), dielectric permittivity decreases to 3.75. A mechanism related to interface evolution is proposed to explain the dielectric properties of the PI/Ag composites. Due to low dielectric loss and excellent insulating property of the PI/Ag composites, it is demonstrated to be potential high-K dielectric materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A composite silver nanoparticle (AgNP) ink was prepared by mixing the small AgNPs (10 nm in diameter), large AgNPs (50 nm in diameter), ethylene glycol, and deionized water at a mass ratio of 4:2:3:51. By spraying a sodium hydroxide solution, the AgNP pattern printed on the polyethylene terephthalate film surface can be sintered at room temperature with a minimum electric resistivity of 12.11 mu Omega.cm, 0.7 times smaller than that sintered at 150 degrees C. Our study confirmed that OH- ions can partially replace citrates on AgNP surfaces at room temperature, resulting in the loss of the encapsulated density of citrates. Such loss can induce the particle agglomeration, cause the sintering necks to form, and finally create the three-dimensional conductive networks. This research is of great importance to the rapid manufacturing of low-cost, low-environmental-impact and high-performance flexible printed circuits. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Indium-doped ZnO nanoparticles coated on nanographene/MECN enhance the field emission properties by avoiding electrostatic screen, providing more emitters, as well as introducing nanographene and indium doping. A simple hydrothermal method is developed to fabricate In-doped ZnO field emitters with different ratios of In and ZnO (5%, 10%, and 20%). The 10% In-ZnO shows a turn-on electric field as low as 1 V.mu m(-1) at a current density of 10 mu A.cm(-2), and the threshold field is 5.8 V.mu m(-1) at 1 mA.cm(-2). The largest current density is 2.88 mA.cm(-2), and the estimated beta is 27918. The emission currents are very stable at high, medium, and low current densities with an average deviation of only 2.5%. The outstanding field emission performance indicates that In-doped ZnO coated on nanographene/MECN is an efficient field emitter and has large potential in displays, lightings, and sensors.

AB The degradation behaviors of epoxy-based shape memory polymer (SMP) after 1 MeV electron irradiation were investigated in the paper. It was founded that the shape fixity rate remained almost no changed at approximately 99.6% while the shape recovery rate decreased rapidly from its original 98.6% to 85.9% with increasing fluence up to 200 x 10(14) cm(-2), which could be owned to the partial cleavage of the cross-linked network of epoxy-based SMP after irradiation. Further research found that the irradiation-induced scissions of the crosslinked network took place as a result of the debonding of the weak aliphatic C-O and C-N groups. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recent research on photocatalytic activities has been investigated using visible light region rather consuming ultraviolet region. In this Paper, a facile and eco-friendly method was developed to the synthesis of TiO2 NPs using Aloe Vera gel (AV-TiO2). The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using XRD, XPS, HRTEM, EDAX and Raman spectroscopy. The sharp peaks by XRD pattern show the crystallinity and purity of titanium dioxide nanoparticles. The shape and morphology were studied by HR-TEM images and confirms the NPs size which falls in the range from 6 to 13 nm. Raman spectrum and XPS shows the energy modes and oxidation state of synthesized TiO2 NPs. TiO2-mediated photo-degradation of trinitrophenol (Picric acid-PA) irradiated by visible light source has also been investigated. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Flowerlike ZIF-67 micro/nano composite structures were developed by the evolution of ZIF-67 rhombododecahedrons ZIF-67(r) via facile ion-assistant solvothermal treatment. The morphology evolution of ZIF-67 with time-on-stream was studied. The flowerlike Co3O4 micro/nano composite were formed under calcination at relatively low temperature. The flowerlike Co3O4 micro/nano composite structures showed good catalytic properties for photocatalytic degradation of RhB (83.2%), higher than that of Co3O4(p) (69.7%) and Co3O4(r) (75.7%) after 90 min irradiation.

AB Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are popular for their electrical conductivity properties with excellent metallic or semiconducting behavior. Selective separation of SWCNTs can play a significant role in the realization of the potential application of SWCNTs like energy conversion and storage, electronics and biomedical applications. Gel filtration is one of the most well-known and efficient large-scale separation techniques but still complex and lengthy. In this paper, we present a very simple, efficient, and low-cost method with only four column chromatography repetitions for separation of SWCNTs using both sephacryl and agarose gels. Our results demonstrate that the small diameter semiconducting (s-) SWCNTs are adsorbed more strongly to the sephacryl gel column, while large diameter s-SWCNTs adsorbed more strongly to the column with agarose gel. Comparative optical absorption spectra of the separated nanotubes and the reference reveal the effectiveness of the presented method. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a new strategy for developing back-side illuminated dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) using nanoporous alumina substrate containing Cu impurities. The presence of a traces of Cu in the aluminum leads to the formation of 3D nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) structure which consisted of an array of cylindrical pores interconnected by horizontal holes. Under different anodizing conditions, four different AAO substrates were fabricated and applied for developing DSSCs. The current-voltage characteristics of the DSSCs were measured and compared. Results obtained indicated that the performance (photocurrent density, open-circuit photovoltage and efficiency) of DSSCs based on 3D AAO was significantly enhanced compared to those of FTO/TiO2. The efficiencies of DSSCs based on alumina P90A, P90B and OX60 were improved by 172%, 51%, and 274%, respectively. The enhancement in photocurrent and efficiency is attributed to the reduction in the carrier recombination, uniform distribution of the dye molecules inside the vertical tubes, horizontal interconnections of pores as well as a reduction in pore size. This indicates that AAO based DSSCs can contribute significantly to energy harvesting from the sun. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Vertical graphene-sheets have been successfully in-situ deposited onto Fe75.5Cu1Nb3Si13.5B7 ribbon by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition and the enhanced magnetoimpedance effect has been observed in the composites. A mass of curly graphene-sheet clusters can be apperceived if there is no buffer layer during the growth. The 20 nm FeCo film is used as the buffer layer during the deposition, and then vertical growth graphene sheets are covered on the Fe-based ribbon as a film. Compared with the untreated sample, the field-dependent magnetoimpedance effect has been obviously improved with graphene covered at low frequencies. At a certain frequency, the magnetoimpedance effect of one side graphene covered sample shows enlargement, but the both sides covered sample shows the reversed tendency. We mainly attribute the reason to the enhanced transverse permeability induced by the vertical graphene morphology. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A composite of Ni/Fe3O4 has been fabricated based on NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) as precursor. Owing to the synergetic electrical coupling effect of Fe3O4 and Ni in the composite, the obtained Ni/Fe3O4 displays excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with a small overpotential of 275 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm (2), much better than those reported for most of other materials. Besides, the obtained catalyst also presents outstanding stability (there was no obviously OER current density degradation in 11 h). These results indicate the possibility for the fabrication of a promising electrocatalyst with effective and low-price by reducing NiFe-LDHs into hybrid materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB New graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) containing 1-alkyl-2,3-dimethyl imidazolium cations (Im(1-1-a), a = alkyl length) are obtained from [Na(ethylenediamine)(1.0)]C-15 by cation exchange. Exchange reactions occur rapidly, but require higher temperature than for substituted alkylammoniums. Powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry and structural modeling indicate that [Im1-1-4]C-47 is a stage-2 GIC with 0.36 nm monolayer galleries and cations oriented parallel to graphene sheets. [Im1-1-12]C-44 is a stage-1 GIC with a gallery expansion of 0.40 nm. The lower sheet charge density for [Im1-1-12] C-44 is commensurate with its larger intercalate. Imidazolium cations without alkyl substitution at the imidazolium ring C2 do not form stable GICs by this route. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pure iron is gaining significance in the field of bone tissue engineering owing to its excellent mechanical and biodegradable properties. However, its degradation rate is too slow which needs to be accelerated. The solution to this problem is the preparation of porous iron scaffolds. However, methods for preparing porous iron have received the least attention and till date, no manufacturing methodology for fabrication of topologically-ordered porous iron structures has been developed. Hence, the present work aims to develop a manufacturing methodology using 3D printing and pressureless microwave sintering for the fabrication of topologically-ordered open cell porous iron scaffold. Two different types of unit cell structures were fabricated, and investigation into the accuracy of fabricated iron scaffolds has been reported. The dimensional deviation varying from 5 to 15% was obtained with the porosity varying within the range of 80-86%. Also, XRD results revealed that no contamination of mould material as well as oxide formation was observed in the fabricated iron scaffolds. Compression tests were performed on the fabricated iron scaffolds. The maximum value of plateau stress, compressive modulus of elasticity and compressive strength were found to be 6.94 MPa, 316 MPa and 16.67 MPa respectively. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB BiOBr hollow microspheres which were composed of BiOBr nanoslices were synthesized via a simple one-pot solvothermal method at 160 degrees C for 12 h without the addition of any spherical template. The resulted BiOBr hollow microspheres were regular in shape with external diameter of 1.4 lm in average. As a result, due to the highly hollow architecture, the resulted BiOBr hollow microsphere processed high BET surface area of 76.38 m(2) g (1). Besides, a series of time-depended experiments had been listed, showing the morphological evolution for the formation and decomposition of the BiOBr hollow microspherical structure. SDS, which acted as a surfactant, played an important role in controlling the morphology of BiOBr. The obtained BiOBr hollow microspheres exhibited higher photocatalytic activity in the degradation of MB and RhB under visible-light irradiation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A simple solvothermal method was reported to prepare a novel BiOCl/BiOCOOH heterojunction photocatalyst. The as prepared composite photocatalysts exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for RhB degradation under simulated sunlight. The composite photocatalysts even exhibited much higher activity than that of P25. The effect of the BiOCl amount on the activity of the composites was also investigated. Results showed that apparent rate constant of the optimal sample was 3, 7.7 and 35.9 times as high as that of P25, BiOCl and BiOCOOH, respectively. The composites would be promising material for the removal of contaminants in water. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel 2D MoS2/RP heterojunction photocatalyst with intimate interfacial contact was successfully fabricated for the first time. The photocatalytic activity of this nanocomposite was evaluated by the removal of the Cr(VI)-RhB coexistence system under visible light irradiation, to 72.7% for Cr(VI) and 97.5% for RhB simultaneously in 80 min. Photoelectrochemical analyses revealed that the MoS2/RP composite show an outstanding charge separation ability compared to the pristine RP, resulting in the enhanced photocatalytic activity. In particular, it can be considered as an efficient and meaningful nanocomposite building method, moreover, provides guidance to further design of photocatalyst toward various applications.

AB Inorganic core-shell semiconductor materials have attracted increasing interest in recent years because of the unique structure, stable chemical properties and high performance in devices. With special properties such as a direct band-gap and excellent photoelectrical characteristics, ZnSe based semiconductor core-shell structures are promising materials for applications in such fields as photocatalysts, light-emitting diodes, solar cells, photodetectors, biomedical science and so on. However, few reviews on ZnSe based semiconductor core-shell structures have been reported so far. Therefore this manuscript mainly focuses on the research activities on ZnSe based semiconductor core-shell composites including various preparation methods and the applications of these core-shell structures, especially in photocatalysts, light emitting, solar cells and photodetectors. The possibilities and limitations of studies on ZnSe based semiconductor core-shell composites are also highlighted.

AB A wavelength tunable perfect absorber with graphene-hexagonal gold (Au) cylinder array on a ground plate is investigated theoretically. The interactions between electromagnetic (EM) waves and monolayer graphene are analyzed through the field distributions and spectral responses in detail. The finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) method is used to investigate the tunable properties of the absorber. It is demonstrated that in an optimized configuration, monolayer graphene can interact with light via critical coupling, and the absorptance can be greatly enhanced and reach to 100% for both transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electronic (TE) polarizations. Furthermore, the influence of geometrical parameters of the structure on the response of the hybrid structure is studied. It is expected that the proposed graphene perfect absorbers can be applied for many applications in the visible (VIS) and the near-infrared (NIR) spectral ranges such as wavelength selective infrared photodetectors and plasmonic sensors.

The compounds exhibited bright luminescence in the visible region due to the [Xe]4f(n) -> [Xe]4f(n) transitions of rare-earth ions. The luminescence is excited both in the [Xe]4f(n) -> [Xe]4f(n) bands of the rare-earth ions and in the wide band in the ultraviolet region related to the transitions within the Mo-O complex. Because of the energy transfer, the luminescence of Tb3+ and Eu3+ in doubly doped molybdates has had common excitation energies.

AB A series of tetraphenylethene-borondipyrromethene (TPE-BODIPY) derivatives with different numbers of methyl groups on BODIPY cores were designed and synthesized. The intramolecular charge transfer behaviors from donor TPE to accepter BODIPY were investigated. Aggregation-induced emission (AIE), theoretical calculation, single crystal structure and solvent effect all proved that the introduction of methyl group to BODIPY can inhibit the intramolecular charge transfer behavior. Red organic luminescent material 8-TPEBODIPY (TPB) with no methyl groups showing twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) emission peak both in solution and in film state, presents obviously AIE and solvatochromic properties and a large Stokes shifts over 100 nm, which can be employed as a fluorescent sensor for the detection of water in THF.

AB In this work, gold films on two different types of substrates were fabricated by electron beam (e-beam) evaporation, and the femtosecond laser-induced damage properties were evaluated. The first sample was gold film deposited on fused silica, whereas the second was gold deposited on photoresist. 1-on-1 damage tests were implemented by an 800 +/- 30 nm laser with pulse duration of 30 fs. Different damage thresholds and morphologies were obtained for the two samples. The damage threshold of the gold film on fused silica was 0.64 J/cm(2), with the typical damage morphology of thermal ablation and melting; the damage threshold of the gold film on photoresist was 0.30 J/cm(2), with the typical damage morphology of blisters or peeling off. In order to better understand the impact of the substrate on the properties of the whole sample, the normalized electric field intensity, temperature, and thermal stress distributions were calculated. The adhesion between the gold film and substrate were measured and the experimental results well agreed with the theoretical analysis. The results indicate that gold films deposited onto grating-structured fused silica will have more powerful laser damage resistance performance.

AB Ethnicity and immigration status may play a role in entrepreneurship and innovation, yet the impact of university entrepreneurship education on this relationship is under-explored. This paper examines the persistence and differences in entrepreneurship by ethnicity and nationality. We find that among Stanford alumni, Asian Americans have a higher rate of entrepreneurship than white Americans. However, non-American Asians have a substantially lower, about 12% points lower, start-up rate than Asian Americans. Such discrepancy not only holds for entrepreneurial choice but also for investing as an angel investor or venture capitalist, or utilizing Stanford networks to find funding sources or partners. Participation in Stanford University's entrepreneurship program as a student does little to reduce this gap. The low level of parental entrepreneurship and the high degree of intergenerational correlation in entrepreneurship likely result in the lower level of entrepreneurship and participation in university entrepreneurship programs among Asians relative to their Asian American counterparts. Our findings highlight the value of immigration in terms of breaking the persistence in entrepreneurship among certain ethnic groups and promoting potential high-growth entrepreneurship in the United States. In addition, our findings may have important implications for programs to incorporate immigrant entrepreneurs within their home countries to promote entrepreneurship and help break the persistence of entrepreneurship across generations.

AB This study explores the extent to which cross-sectional differences in firms' propensity to absorb and utilize scientific knowledge matter for their stock market and operating performance. Unlike previous empirical studies and given the coexistence of both benefits and potential costs to science-guided search, I conceptualize innovation as a recombinant search to hypothesize a non-monotonic relationship. Using patent data from the European Patent Office (EPO) relative to 3281 international firms over the 1999-2015 period, empirical tests yield evidence in support of the predictions. However, the effect varies with firm-level absorptive capacity, across industries and countries. As suggested by a limited attention model, I find a stronger payoff predictive power of science for firms with lower investor attention and higher valuation uncertainty. Besides, the association between science and future operating performance increases with time, indicating that firms' scientific capabilities are a potent driver of long-term profitability. The conclusions are robust to controlling for the endogenous nature of firms' use of scientific knowledge. By providing a useful basis upon which to judge the economic merit of firms' innovation endeavors, this study contributes to reducing capital market imperfections that curtail access to external finance and ultimately spurring private-sector investment in R&D. It also provides evidence of diminishing marginal payoffs to science-led search. Finally, the evidence is likely to be relevant to policymakers, who might wish to influence the innovation ecosystem in a way to sustain long-term prosperity.

AB In fast-paced and knowledge-intensive environments, licensing partnerships can be powerful levers for market expansion. Research on the management of technology-oriented licenses has nonetheless pointed out the risks of corrosive disputes caused by conflicting interests or misunderstandings among licensing partners. The choice made ex ante on mechanisms for resolving potential disputes is of prime importance in the execution of licensing exchanges. Although the legal literature has widely emphasized the advantages of arbitration towards litigation, public ordering remains the "default" option in managers' eyes. By adopting a transaction cost economics logic, our study explores the conditions under which licensing partners may prefer arbitration over public ordering during the contractual-design phase. In accordance with our theoretical arguments, findings show that the occurrence of arbitration provisions increases when the coordination orientation adopted by licensing partners is extensive. In situations where both monitoring and coordination orientations are simultaneously extensive, results reveal a greater propensity to prefer arbitration over public ordering. Our research therefore supports the view that corporate decision-makers tend to favor the conciliatory stance and compromising awards typically associated with arbitration, only when exchanges are expected to be highly coordinative. Their preference for arbitration over litigation is magnified when the coordination orientation develops alongside the monitoring orientation.

AB This study focuses on the multiplexity of firm R&D networks, and it investigates two types of boundary-spanning networks: the bipartite network between firms and government-sponsored institutions (GSIs), and the traditional firm-firm network. We apply a social network perspective to examine the effects that these kinds of networks have on firm innovativeness, in relation to the effects of the firm's internal R&D efforts. We define the firm-GSI network as bipartite, and we investigate how the structural characteristics of this network (cohesion and centrality) affect innovativeness. We then decompose the innovational effects of firm-firm networks into two categories (intra- and inter-sector) to distinguish the effects of these collaboration networks. Furthermore, we investigate how these various external collaborative networks interact with a firm's internal R&D efforts for driving innovativeness. Our empirical study of 420 manufacturing firms in Mexico evaluates evidence from surveys and secondary data. The findings indicate that the structural properties of both firm-GSI and firm-firm networks have positive effects on innovativeness, but firm-GSI network cohesion has a stronger negative interaction with R&D in influencing firm innovativeness. Moreover, intra-sector centrality in a firm-firm network has a stronger negative interaction with R&D than inter-sector centrality does in driving firm innovativeness. We contribute to the literature by integrating insights from the perspectives of network multiplexity, social embeddedness, and resource complementarity in regard to inter-organizational behavior. Our study also provides meaningful guidelines for both managers and policy makers. The study's findings are robust to concerns of common method bias and alternative model specifications.

AB Technological progress is often at the heart of improvements in quality of life. The development of personal computers (PCs) and the Internet are among the most important technological advances of the last century. PCs and the Internet have profoundly changed the way we access information, shop, view media, communicate, socialize, and spend our time. Despite the many benefits of computer and Internet use, certain population groups - especially low-educated and older consumers - have not yet fully adopted computer technology and the Internet in their daily lives. This paper estimates the effects of early-life education on computer and Internet use among older Italians. Using data on early-life educational attainment and computer and Internet use of older adults from the 2013 Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we exploit a historical increase in compulsory schooling in Italy as an instrumental variable for education to estimate the effects of early-life education on the adoption of PCs and on current use of the Internet. We find large and statistically significant effects of early-life education on later-life technology use among older persons who obtained additional education due to increased schooling requirements. In our benchmark estimations, one additional year of schooling resulted in an eight percentage point increase in the probability of having ever used a computer and in a 12 percentage point increase in the probability of reporting to have at least good computer skills. Individuals affected by the reform were also six percentage points more likely to have used the Internet in the last week. These findings are robust across different sample selection and model specification strategies. Our analysis also suggests that occupational choice and computer use at work are important channels through which education affects the adoption and use of computers and the Internet. Our findings thus highlight the likely importance of early-life education for later-life computer and the Internet use and perhaps technology adoption more broadly.

AB This paper investigates the effect of being located in a cluster on firm growth. In particular, it focuses on the differential growth effect of being located in a cluster, or a growth divide among clustered firms, based on the idea that, contrary to the conventional wisdom, advantages of geographical clustering are not randomly or equally available to clustered firms. Due to the intense competition among clustered firms for resources such as creative talent, firms who are more attractive to the resources are more likely to entice better resources and hence achieve higher growth. Our empirical analysis of firms in nine industries across six countries shows that being located in a cluster per se does not have a positive effect on firm growth and that domestic technological leaders with a sufficient technological distance to the global technological frontier show differentially higher growth due both to the attractiveness to promising resources and to the opportunity for incoming knowledge spillovers from global technological leaders.

AB Background: This study examined the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) D) and pulmonary function, among Korean adults, from 2010 to 2014.
   Methods: The data were obtained from the fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES 5), and the first and second year (2013-2014) of KNHANES 6. The study population comprised 14,378 individuals. The variable of interest was serum 25(OH) D, and the dependent variable, pulmonary function.
   Results: All people with vitamin D levels below 30 ng/ml had lower lung functions, which was significant in lower forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) (serum 25(OH) D < 10 ng/ml, 20 to < 30 ng/ml: P=.001, 10 to < 20 ng/ml: P=0) and forced vital capacity (FVC) (serum 25(OH) D level < 10 ng/ml: P=.01, 10 to < 20 ng/ml: P=.001, 20 to < 30 ng/ml: P=.008). The lower the serum 25(OH) D, the lower the levels of FEV1 in men and this was significant. (serum 25(OH) D < 10 ng/ml: P=.007, 10 to < 20 ng/ml: P=.002, 20 to < 30 ng/ml: P=.007). The values of FEV1 and FVC were lower in people aged 50-69 years when vitamin D was lower than 30 ng/ml which were all significant. Among participants with BMI values < 23 kg/m(2), lower vitamin D levels were significantly associated with lower pulmonary function.
   Conclusions: We found a significant association between serum 25(OH) D and pulmonary function, and this was related to sex, age and body mass index.

AB Background: High N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) during COPD exacerbations is associated with worse clinical outcomes. The prognostic value of NT-proBNP measured during clinical stability has not been well characterized.
   Methods: We studied SPIROMICS participants 40-80 years of age with COPD GOLD spirometric stages 1-4. The association between baseline NT-proBNP and incident COPD exacerbations within one year of follow-up was tested using zero-inflated Poisson regression models adjusted for age, gender, race, body mass index, current smoking status, smoking history, FEV1 percent predicted, COPD Assessment Test score, exacerbation history, total lung capacity on chest CT and cardiovascular disease (any of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure).
   Results: Among 1051 participants (mean age 66.1 years, 41.4% women), mean NT-proBNP was 608.9 pg/ml. Subjects in GOLD stage D had the highest mean NT-proBNP. After one year of follow-up, 268 participants experienced one or more COPD exacerbations. One standard deviation increase in baseline NT-proBNP was associated with a 13% increase in the risk of incident exacerbations (incident risk ratio 1.13; 95% CI 1.06-1.19; p < 0.0001). This association was maintained in participants with and without cardiovascular disease.
   Conclusion: Baseline NT-proBNP in COPD is an independent predictor of respiratory exacerbations, even in individuals without overt cardiac disease. The impact of detection and treatment of early cardiovascular dysfunction on COPD exacerbation frequency warrants further investigation.

AB Objectives/Background: Short sleep duration during adolescence is associated with increased dietary intake and greater risk for overweight/obesity. However, findings are mixed on the relationship between sleep and physical activity (PA) during the school year, when short sleep duration is most common. Furthermore, there is concern that increasing sleep duration may interfere with opportunities for PA, yet this has not been directly tested. This study examined the impact of an at-home experimental sleep extension protocol on PA during the school year among short-sleeping adolescents.
   Participants/Methods: Participants included 18 adolescents (67% female, 78% white) who reported regularly sleeping between 5-7 h on school nights. Adolescents completed a five-week, at-home sleep manipulation protocol with an initial baseline week followed in a randomized, counterbalanced order by two experimental conditions, each lasting two weeks. During prescribed habitual sleep (HAB), bedtimes and rise times were set to match the baseline sleep pattern, and during sleep extension (EXT), adolescents were instructed to increase time in bed on school nights by 1.5 h per night relative to baseline. Wrist-mounted actigraphy was employed to monitor sleep and waist-mounted accelerometers were used to measure daytime PA.
   Results: Adolescents slept for an average duration of 71 min longer on school nights during EXT than during HAB (p < 0.001). During HAB, adolescents spent more time in sedentary behavior (p = 0.002) than during EXT, but there were no cross-condition differences in light activity (p = 0.184) or moderate-to-vigorous PA (p = 0.102).
   Conclusions: Extending sleep duration on school nights in short-sleeping adolescents reduces time spent in sedentary behavior, without having a negative impact on health-promoting moderate-to-vigorous PA. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate in a randomized clinical trial the role of sleep-related cognitive variables in the long-term efficacy of an online, fully automated cognitive behavioral therapy intervention for insomnia (CBT-I) (Sleep Healthy Using the Internet [SHUTi]).
   Method: Three hundred and three participants (M-age = 43.3 years; SD = 11.6) were randomly assigned to SHUTi or an online patient education condition and assessed at baseline, post-intervention (nine weeks after baseline), and six and 12 months after the intervention period. Cognitive variables were self-reported internal and chance sleep locus of control, dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep (DBAS), sleep specific self-efficacy, and insomnia knowledge. Primary outcomes were self-reported online ratings of insomnia severity (Insomnia Severity Index), and sleep onset latency and wake after sleep onset from online sleep diaries, collected 12 months after the intervention period.
   Results: Those who received SHUTi had, at postassessment, higher levels of insomnia knowledge (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.10-0.16) and internal sleep locus of control (95% CI = 0.04-0.55) as well as lower DBAS (95% CI = 1.52-2.39) and sleep locus of control attributed to chance (95% CI = 0.15-0.71). Insomnia knowledge, chance sleep locus of control, and DBAS mediated the relationship between condition and at least one 12-month postassessment sleep outcome. Within the SHUTi condition, changes in each cognitive variable (with the exception of internal sleep locus of control) predicted improvement in at least one sleep outcome one year later.
   Conclusion: Online CBT-I may reduce the enormous public health burden of insomnia by changing underlying cognitive variables that lead to long-term changes in sleep outcomes. Published by Elsevier B.V.

   PATTERNS
AB Objective: Eveningness tendency and insomnia are common in adolescents, but whether they have an independent or synergistic effect on the risk of psychopathology have remained undefined. The present study aimed to examine eveningness chronotype and insomnia symptoms in relation to mental health and emotional and behavioural problems in a community-based adolescent population.
   Methods: A total of 4948 adolescents (weighted mean age: 14.5 +/- 1.8 years, weighted percentage of females: 48.9%) completed the measures. Insomnia was assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and chronotype preference was measured by the reduced version of the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ). Emotional and behavioural problems and mental health were assessed by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), respectively. Potential confounders including demographic factors, pubertal status, general health, and sleep duration were controlled for in the analyses.
   Results: Insomnia symptoms were prevalent in evening-type adolescents (52% vs intermediate-type: 34.3%, morning-type: 18.0%, p < 0.001), especially two subtypes of insomnia symptoms, including difficulty initiating sleep and difficulty maintaining sleep. Eveningness and insomnia were independently associated with an increased risk of having emotional and behavioural problems (eveningness: adjusted odds ratio [AdjOR] = 1.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.61-2.19, p < 0.001; insomnia: AdjOR = 3.66, 95% CI = 2.73-4.91) as well as poor mental health in adolescents (eveningness: AdjOR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.04-1.52, p < 0.001; insomnia: AdjOR = 3.63, 95% CI = 2.41-5.03).
   Conclusions: Eveningness and insomnia symptoms are independently associated with the risk of psychopathology in adolescents. Our findings underscore the need to address both sleep and circadian factors in assessing and managing emotional and behavioural problems in the adolescent population. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: Sleep is viewed as being relatively consistent across the school-age period (6-13 years of age), however this claim has not been empirically supported. The objective of this study was to document the duration, schedule, variability, and week versus weekend discrepancies of sleep in three distinct age groups within the school-age period.
   Methods: Participants were divided by age: Cycle 1, 6 and 7 years; Cycle 2, 8 and 9 years; and Cycle 3, 10 and 11 years. For seven consecutive nights, sleep was assessed in the home environment using an actigraph.
   Results: Compared to children of Cycle 1, those of Cycles 2 and 3 showed increasing and significant delays in sleep start time, increasingly shorter assumed and actual sleep durations, and larger night-to-night variability of sleep. Of the children in Cycles 1, 2, and 3, 96%, 87.7%, and 51.3%, respectively, were found to spend the recommended 9-11 h in bed. However, the actigraphic 'true sleep' measure revealed that only 17%, 7%, and 2.5% of these children, respectively, obtained the recommended amount of sleep.
   Conclusion: Sleep duration, schedule, and variability change significantly across the school-age period. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Study objectives: We present an automated sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral analysis pipeline that includes an automated artifact detection step, and we test the hypothesis that spectral power density estimates computed with this pipeline are comparable to those computed with a commercial method preceded by visual artifact detection by a sleep expert (standard approach).
   Methods: EEG data were analyzed from the C3-A2 lead in a sample of polysomnograms from 161 older women participants in a community-based cohort study. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and Cohen's kappa measures from epoch-by-epoch comparisons of automated to visual-based artifact detection results; then we computed the average EEG spectral power densities in six commonly used EEG frequency bands and compared results from the two methods using correlation analysis and Bland-Altman plots.
   Results: Assessment of automated artifact detection showed high specificity [96.8%-99.4% in non-rapid eye movement (NREM), 96.9%-99.1% in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep] but low sensitivity (26.7% -38.1% in NREM, 9.1-27.4% in REM sleep). However, large artifacts (total power > 99th percentile) were removed with sensitivity up to 87.7% in NREM and 90.9% in REM, with specificities of 96.9% and 96.6%, respectively. Mean power densities computed with the two approaches for all EEG frequency bands showed very high correlation (>= 0.99). The automated pipeline allowed for a 100-fold reduction in analysis time with regard to the standard approach.
   Conclusion: Despite low sensitivity for artifact rejection, the automated pipeline generated results comparable to those obtained with a standard method that included manual artifact detection. Automated pipelines can enable practical analyses of recordings from thousands of individuals, allowing for use in genetics and epidemiological research requiring large samples.

AB Ciguatoxins (CTXs) and brevetoxins (PbTxs) are phycotoxins that can accumulate along the marine food chain and thus cause seafood poisoning in humans, namely "ciguatera fish poisoning" (CFP) and "neurotoxic shellfish poisoning" (NSP), respectively. CFP is characterized by early gastrointestinal symptoms and typical sensory disorders (paraesthesia, pain, pruritus and cold dysaesthesia), which can persist several weeks and, in some cases, several months or years. NSP is considered a mild form of CFP with similar but less severe symptoms. After inhaled exposure, PbTxs can also cause respiratory tract irritation in healthy subjects and asthma exacerbations in predisposed subjects, whose respiratory functions may be disrupted for several days following PbTx inhalation. Mechanistically, it is well established that CTX- or PbTx-induced disturbances are primarily mainly due to voltage-gated sodium channel activation in sensory and motor peripheral nervous system. However, little is known about the pathophysiology or a potential individual susceptibility to long lasting effects of CFP/NSP. In addition to their action on the nervous system, PbTxs and CTXs were also shown to exert effects on the immune system. However, their role in the pathophysiology of syndromes induced by CTX or PbTx exposure is poorly documented. The aim of this review is to inventory the literature thus far on the inflammatory and immune effects of PbTxs and CTXs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work reports the purification of new potent scorpion neuropeptide, named BotAF, by an activity guided screening approach. BotAF is a 64-residue long-chain peptide that shares very high similarity with the original beta-like scorpion toxin group, in which several peptides have been characterized to be anti-nociceptive in rodents. BotAF administration to rodents does not produce any toxicity or motor impairment, including at high doses. In all models investigated, BotAF turned out to be an efficient peptide in abolishing acute and inflammatory (both somatic and visceral) pain in rodents. It performs with high potency compared to standard analgesics tested in the same conditions. The anti-nociceptive activity of BotAF depends on the route of injection: it is inactive when tested by i.c.v. or i.v. routes but gains in potency when pre-injected locally (in the same compartment than the irritant itself) or by i.t. root 40 to 60 min before pain induction, respectively. BotAF is not an AINS-like compound as it fails to reduce inflammatory edema. Also, it does not activate the opioidergic system as its activity is not affected by naloxone. BotAF does also not bind onto RyR and has low activity towards DRG ion channels (particularly TTX sensitive Na+ channels) and does not bind onto rat brain synaptosome receptors. In somatic and visceral pain models, BotAF dose-dependently inhibited lumbar spinal cord c-fos/c-jun mRNA up regulation. Altogether, our data favor a spinal or peripheral anti-nociceptive mode of action of BotAF. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The conventional biological processes for municipal wastewater are facing the challenges of high energy consumption and production of excessive sludge. To address these two emerging issues, this study demonstrated the feasibility to integrate mainstream anammox into an A-2B process for municipal wastewater treatment towards energy-efficient operation with reduced sludge production. In the proposed A-2B process, an anaerobic fixed bed reactor (AFBR) served as A-stage for COD capture, an anammox moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) was employed as B2-stage, which received effluent containing nitrite from a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) at B1-stage. The results showed that under the operation conditions studied, 58% of influent COD was converted methane gas at A-stage, and 87% total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) removal was achieved with the effluent TIN concentration of 6.5 mg/L. Moreover, it was shown that at least 75% of sludge reduction was obtained due to the COD capture at A-stage. The high-throughput sequencing analysis further revealed that Candidatus Kuenenia was the dominant genus responsible for the observed anammox at B2-stage MBBR. This study clearly demonstrated a novel process configuration for sustaining mainstream anammox for municipal wastewater reclamation towards energy-efficient operation with minimized sludge production.

AB The presence of antibiotics in aquatic environments has attracted global concern. Fenton process is an attractive yet challenging method for antibiotics degradation, especially when such a reaction can be conducted at neutral pH values. In this study, a novel composite Fe/Co catalyst was synthesized via the modification of steel converter slag (SCS) by salicylic acid-methanol (SAM) and cobalt nitrate (Co(NO3)(2)). The catalysts were characterized by N-2-Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The results indicated that the Co-SAM-SCS/H2O2 Fenton-like system was very effective for sulfamethazine (SMZ) degradation at a wide pH range. At initial pH of 7.0, the degradation rate of SMZ in Co-SAM-SCS/H2O2 system was 2.48, 3.20, 6.18, and 16.21 times of that in Fe-SAM-SCS/H2O2, SAM-SCS/H2O2, Co(NO3)(2)/H2O2 and SCS/H2O2 system, respectively. The preliminary analysis suggested that high surface area of Co-SAM-SCS sample and synergistic effect between introduced Co and SAM-SCS are responsible for the efficient catalytic activity. During the degradation, three main intermediates were identified by high performance liquid chromatography -mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) analysis. Based on this, a possible degradation pathway was proposed. The SEM images, XRD patterns and XPS spectra before and after the reactions demonstrate that the crystal and chemical structure of Co-SAM-SCS after five cycles are almost unchanged. Besides, the CoSAM-SCS presented low iron and cobalt leaching (0.17 mg/L and 2.36 mg/L, respectively). The studied Fenton-like process also showed high degradation of SMZ in river water and municipal wastewater. The progress will bring valuable insights to develop high-performance heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts for environmental remediation. (c)018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Even though nitrification/denitrification is a robust technology to remove nitrogen from sewage, economic incentives drive its future replacement by shortcut nitrogen removal processes. The latter necessitates high potential activity ratios of ammonia oxidizing to nitrite oxidizing bacteria (rAOB/rNOB). The goal of this study was to identify which wastewater and process parameters can govern this in reality. Two sewage treatment plants (STP) were chosen based on their inverse rAOB/rNOB values (at 20 degrees C): 0.6 for Blue Plains (BP, Washington DC, US) and 1.6 for Nieuwveer (NV, Breda, NL). Disproportional and dissimilar relationships between AOB or NOB relative abundances and respective activities pointed towards differences in community and growth/activity limiting parameters. The AOB communities showed to be particularly different. Temperature had no discriminatory effect on the nitrifiers' activities, with similar Arrhenius temperature dependences (Theta(AOB) = 1.10, Theta(NOB) = 1.06-1.07). To uncouple the temperature effect from potential limitations like inorganic carbon, phosphorus and nitrogen, an add-on mechanistic methodology based on kinetic modelling was developed. Results suggest that BP's AOB activity was limited by the concentration of inorganic carbon (not by residual N and P), while NOB experienced less limitation from this. For NV, the sludge-specific nitrogen loading rate seemed to be the most prevalent factor limiting AOB and NOB activities. Altogether, this study shows that bottom-up mechanistic modelling can identify parameters that influence the nitrification performance. Increasing inorganic carbon in BP could invert its rAOB/rNOB value, facilitating its transition to shortcut nitrogen removal. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) using peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for environmental decontamination has received increasing interest. In this study, oxidation kinetics and products of four steroid estrogens (i.e., estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol) by PMS under various conditions were investigated. PMS could fairly degrade steroid estrogens over the pH range of 7-10, and the degradation rate increased with the increase of solution pH. This pH-dependence was well described by parallel reactions between individual acid-base species of steroid estrogens (E and E-) and PMS (HSO5- and SO52-), where specific second-order rate constants for E- with HSO5- and SO52- were in the range of 2.11-5.58 M(-1)s(-1) and 0.77-1.25 M(-1)s(-1), respectively. Identification of oxidation products by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer showed that PMS readily oxidized the phenolic group of steroid estrogens, leading to the generation of hydroxylated and ring-opening products. The presence of bromide and chloride ions (Br- and Cl-) at environmentally relevant levels could greatly accelerate the degradation of steroid estrogens by PMS with the formation of halogenated aromatic products. This effect was quantitatively estimated by a kinetic model, where the formation of free bromine and chorine and their rapid electrophilic substitution with steroid estrogens were taken into consideration. Eco-toxicity of transformation products of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol by PMS treatment in the absence and presence of bromide and chloride was estimated by quantitative structure -activity relationship analysis using ECOSAR. These findings advance the understanding of ISCO using PMS. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Removal efficiencies of 28 pesticide transformation products (TPs) and 15 parent pesticides during steps in drinking water treatment (coagulation-sedimentation, activated carbon adsorption, and ozonation) were estimated via laboratory-scale batch experiments, and the mechanisms underlying the removal at each step were elucidated via regression analyses. The removal via powdered activated carbon (PAC) treatment was correlated positively with the log K-ow at pH 7. The adjusted coefficient of determination (r(2)) increased when the energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) was added as an explanatory variable, the suggestion being that adsorption onto PAC particles was largely governed by hydrophobic interactions. The residual error could be partly explained by pi-pi electron donor-acceptor interactions between the graphene surface of the PAC particles and the adsorbates. The removal via ozonation correlated positively with the energy level of the HOMO, probably because compounds with relatively high energy level HOMOs could more easily transfer an electron to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of ozone. Overall, the TPs tended to be more difficult to remove via PAC adsorption and ozonation than their parent pesticides. However, the TPs that were difficult to remove via PAC adsorption did not induce strong mutagenicity after chlorination, and the TPs that were associated with strong mutagenicity after chlorination could be removed via PAC adsorption. Therefore, PAC adsorption is hypothesized to be an effective method of treating drinking water to reduce the possibility of postchlorination mutagenicity associated with both TPs and their parent pesticides.

AB Wastewater effluents increase the nutrient load of receiving streams while introducing a myriad of anthropogenic chemical pollutants that challenge the resident aquatic (micro)biota. Disentangling the effects of both kind of stressors and their potential interaction on the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial communities requires highly controlled manipulative experiments. In this work, we investigated the effects of a combined regime of nutrients (at low, medium and high concentrations) and a mixture of emerging contaminants (ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac, and methylparaben) on the bacterial composition, abundance and antibiotic resistance profile of biofilms grown in artificial streams. In particular, we investigated the effect of this combined stress on genes encoding resistance to ciprofloxacin (qnrS), erythromycin (ermB), sulfamethoxazole (sul1 and sul2) as well as the class 1 integron-integrase gene (intI1). Only genes conferring resistance to sulfonamides (sul1 and sul2) and intI1 gene were detected in all treatments during the study period. Besides, bacterial communities exposed to emerging contaminants showed higher copy numbers of sul1 and intI1 genes than those not exposed, whereas nutrient amendments did not affect their abundance. However, bacterial communities exposed to both emerging contaminants and a high nutrient concentration (1, 25 and 1 mg L-1 of phosphate, nitrate and ammonium, respectively) showed the highest increase on the abundance of sul1 and intI1 genes thus suggesting a factors synergistic effect of both stressors. Since none of the treatments caused a significant change on the composition of bacterial communities, the enrichment of sul1 and intI1 genes within the community was caused by their dissemination under the combined pressure exerted by nutrients and emerging contaminants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the contribution of nutrients on the maintenance and spread of antibiotic resistance genes in streambed biofilms under controlled conditions. Our results also highlight that nutrients could enhance the effect of emerging contaminants on the dissemination of antibiotic resistance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The general consensus is that the abundance of tap water bacteria is greatly influenced by water purification and distribution. Those bacteria that are released from biofilm in the distribution system are especially considered as the major potential risk for drinking water bio-safety. For the first time, this full-scale study has captured and identified the proportional contribution of the source water, treated water, and distribution system in shaping the tap water bacterial community based on their microbial community fingerprints using the Bayesian "SourceTracker" method. The bacterial community profiles and diversity analyses illustrated that the water purification process shaped the community of planktonic and suspended particle-associated bacteria in treated water. The bacterial communities associated with suspended particles, loose deposits, and biofilm were similar to each other, while the community of tap water planktonic bacteria varied across different locations in distribution system. The microbial source tracking results showed that there was not a detectable contribution of source water to bacterial community in the tap water and distribution system. The planktonic bacteria in the treated water was the major contributor to planktonic bacteria in the tap water (17.7-54.1%). The particle-associated bacterial community in the treated water seeded the bacterial community associated with loose deposits (24.9 -32.7%) and biofilm (37.8-43.8%) in the distribution system. In return, the loose deposits and biofilm showed a significant influence on tap water planktonic and particle-associated bacteria, which were location dependent and influenced by hydraulic changes. This was revealed by the increased contribution of loose deposits to tap water planktonic bacteria (from 2.5% to 38.0%) and an increased contribution of biofilm to tap water particle-associated bacteria (from 5.9% to 19.7%) caused by possible hydraulic disturbance from proximal to distal regions. Therefore, our findings indicate that the tap water bacteria could possibly be managed by selecting and operating the purification process properly and cleaning the distribution system effectively.

AB Individual treatment processes like biological treatment or ozonation have their limitations for the removal of pharmaceuticals from secondary clarified effluents with high organic matter concentrations (i.e. 17 mg TOC/L). These limitations can be overcome by combining these two processes for a cost-effective pharmaceutical removal. A three-step biological-ozone-biological (BO3B) treatment process was therefore designed for the enhanced pharmaceutical removal from wastewater effluent. The first biological step removed 38% of ozone scavenging TOC, thus proportionally reducing the absolute ozone input for the subsequent ozonation. Complementariness between biological and ozone treatment, i.e. targeting different pharmaceuticals, resulted in cost-effective pharmaceutical removal by the overall BO3B process. At a low ozone dose of 0.2 g O-3/g TOC and an HRT of 1.46 h in the biological reactors, the removal of 8 out of 9 pharmaceuticals exceeded 85%, except for metoprolol (60%). Testing various ozone doses and HRTs revealed that pharmaceuticals were ineffectively removed at 0.1 g O3/g TOC and an HRT of 0.3 h. At HRTs of 0.47 and 1.46 h easily and moderately biodegradable pharmaceuticals such as caffeine, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, naproxen and sulfamethoxazole were over 95% removed by biological treatment. The biorecalcitrant carbamazepine was completely ozonated at a dose of 0.4 g O-3/g TOC. Ozonation products are likely biodegraded in the last biological reactor as a 17% TOC removal was found. No appreciable acute toxicity towards D. magna, P. subcapitata and Vi fischeri was found after exposure to the influents and effluents of the individual BO3B reactors. The BO3B process is estimated to increase the yearly wastewater treatment tariff per population equivalent in the Netherlands by less than 10%. Overall, the BO3B process is a cost-effective treatment process for the removal of pharmaceuticals from secondary clarified effluents. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The electro-peroxone (E-peroxone) process is an emerging ozone-based advanced oxidation process (AOP) that has shown large potential for micropollutant abatement in water treatment. To evaluate its performance under more realistic conditions of water treatment, a continuous-flow pilot E-peroxone system was developed and compared with conventional ozonation and a UV/O-3 process for micropollutant abatements in various water matrices (groundwater, surface water, and secondary wastewater effluent) in this study. With a specific ozone dose of 1.5 mg o(3)/mg DOC, micropollutants that have high and moderate reactivity with ozone (O-3) (diclofenac, naproxen, gemfibrozil, and bezafibrate) could be sufficiently abated (>90% abatement) in the various waters by all three processes. However, ozoneresistant micropollutants (ibuprofen, clofibric acid, and chloramphenicol) were abated only by similar to 32 -68%, 68-91%, and 73-90% during conventional ozonation of the selected groundwater, surface water, and secondary wastewater effluent, respectively. By electro-generating H2O2 or applying UV irradiation to enhance o(3) transformation to center dot OH during ozonation, the E-peroxone and UV/O-3 processes similarly enhanced the abatement efficiencies of ozone-resistant micropollutants by similar to 15-43%, similar to 5-15%, and similar to 5 -10% in the groundwater, surface water, and secondary wastewater effluent, respectively. In addition, the E-peroxone and UV/O-3 processes significantly reduced bromate formation during the treatment of the three waters compared to conventional ozonation. Due to its higher efficiency, the E-peroxone process reduced similar to 10-53% of the energy consumption required to abate the concentration of chloramphenicol (the most ozone-resistant micropollutant spiked in the waters) by 1 order of magnitude in the three waters compared to conventional ozonation. In contrast, the UV/O-3 process consumed approximately 4 -10 times higher energy than conventional ozonation. This pilot-scale study demonstrates that the E-peroxone process can provide a feasible, effective, and energy-efficient alternative for micropollutant abatement and bromate control in water and wastewater treatment.
