AB BACKGROUND: Currently, various materials are routinely used for cranioplasty after decompressive craniectomy, each with their own features, potential benefits, and harms.
   OBJECTIVES: To systematically review available literature about safety (infection, resorption, and removal) of different materials used for cranioplasty for any indication.
   METHODS: A comprehensive search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library was performed for relevant studies published up to January 2017. Study quality was assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias assessment tool, and a set of 27 predetermined parameters was extracted by 2 investigators independently for further analysis.
   RESULTS: The search yielded 2 randomized, 14 prospective, and 212 retrospective studies, totaling 10,346 cranioplasties in which 1952 (18.9%) complications were reported in patients between 0 and 90 years old. Overall, study quality was low and heterogeneity was large. Graft infections and resorption were most prevalent: overall infection rate was 5.6%. Autologous cranioplasties showed an infection rate of 6.9% versus 5.0% in combined alloplastic materials, including poly(methyl methacrylate) with 7.8%. Resorption occurred almost exclusively in autologous cranioplasties (11.3%). The greatest removal rate was reported for autologous cranioplasties (overall: 10.4%), which was significantly greater than that of combined alloplastic materials (overall: 5.1%; risk difference [0.052 [95% confidence interval: 0.039-0.066]; NNT = 19 [95% confidence interval: 15-25]).
   CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence on the safety of cranioplasty materials is limited due to a large diversity in study conduct, patients included, and outcomes reported. Autografts appear to carry a greater failure risk than allografts. Future publications concerning cranioplasties will benefit by a standardized reporting of surgical procedures, outcomes, and graft materials used.

AB Vessel wall imaging (VWI) is emerging as a novel imaging tool for the management and risk stratification of patients with intracranial saccular aneurysms. Our objective was to compare the rates of wall enhancement in unstable (ruptured, growing, or symptomatic) and stable aneurysms and assess the ability of VWI with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging to distinguish between these 2 entities.
   This study was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, and eligible studies were identified through a comprehensive literature review. A meta-analysis was conducted to examine the association between aneurysm wall enhancement and aneurysm instability with the use of a random effects model. The I-2 statistic was used to assess for heterogeneity.
   Six studies comprising 505 saccular aneurysms were included. Aneurysms that showed vessel wall enhancement had statistically significant higher odds of being unstable (odds ratio [OR]: 20; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.4-62.1; I-2: 63.1%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of VWI in identifying unstable aneurysms were 95.0% (90.4-97.8), 62.7% (57.1-67.9), 55.8% (52.2-59.4), and 96.2% (92.8-98.0), respectively.
   There is a statistically significant association between vessel wall enhancement and aneurysm instability. Importantly, the lack of wall enhancement is a strong predictor of aneurysm stability. VWI could potentially provide new insights in the management of intracranial aneurysms.

AB PURPOSE: The posterior transpedicular approach (PTA) is a posterior approach that has the advantage of achieving circumferential arthrodesis by a single posterior-only approach. The purpose of this study was to analyze our experience with PTA in the management of pediatric traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures (TTLBFs).
   METHODS: Consecutive pediatric patients (age <= 18 years) with TTLBFs treated with PTA for 6 years were included in this retrospective study. Correction of kyphotic deformity and change in neurologic status were analyzed to assess outcome. The Cobb angle and American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade were used for this purpose.
   RESULTS: There were 6 male and 8 female patients. Five patients had complete injury (ASIA-A), and 9 had incomplete injury. The mean Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity score was 6.71. The mean preoperative Cobb angle was 14.71 degrees and improved to -3.35 degrees postoperatively (mean kyphosis correction -18.05 degrees). Two of the patients experienced iatrogenic nerve root injury. There was 1 postoperative mortality due to complications unrelated to the surgery. The mean Cobb angle was -0.07 degrees at the 32.2-month follow-up visit. Six patients experienced cage subsidence, but none required revision surgery. Post-operatively, 11 (78.5%) patients showed neurologic improvement, and none experienced deterioration. The average ASIA score improved from 2.5 to 3.78. A fusion rate of 100% (n = 12) was observed at the last follow-up visit.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that PTA is a feasible approach in selected pediatric patients with unstable traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures, with results comparable with those in the adult population. This study demonstrates in detail the procedure, along with the neurologic and radiologic outcomes of this approach in the pediatric population.

   PROGRESSION; RESECTION; SURVIVAL; GLIOMAS
AB BACKGROUND: Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) enables ablation of lesions using thermal energy with minimal damage to surrounding regions. Bevacizumab has been used as an adjuvant therapy in recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). At present, bevacizumab is administered at least 4-6 weeks after surgical intervention; however, given the minimally invasive nature of LITT, we suggest that bevacizumab can be safely administered at a shorter interval after LITT.
   METHODS: Three patients who showed evidence of recurrent GBM on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), underwent LITT, and were subsequently administered bevacizumab within 4 weeks were identified retrospectively. Postoperative MRI was performed 24 hours after treatment and before follow-up. All 3 patients were placed on dexamethasone taper postoperatively. The ablated tumors were analyzed radiographically, and bevacizumab symptoms were monitored carefully.
   RESULTS: The patients ranged in age from 39 to 69 years. The median duration of follow-up was 26 weeks (range, 13-51 weeks). All 3 patients expired due to disease progression. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 17 weeks (range, 12-22 weeks), and the median overall survival (OS) was 32 weeks (range, 12-51 weeks). There were no postoperative complications or complications due to hemorrhage, infection, or thrombosis (complication rate, 0%; 95% confidence interval 0-56%).
   CONCLUSIONS: This case series suggests that bevacizumab administration is safe within 1 month after LITT, thus showing promise in treating recurrent GBM. Larger studies are warranted to assess the efficacy of combined bevacizumab and LITT.

ID FIBER DISSECTION; TEMPORAL STEM; ANATOMY; LOBE; TRACKING; VISION
AB BACKGROUND: The optic radiation (OR) is a white matter bundle with a very complex anatomy. Its anterior component bends sharply around the tip of the temporal horn, forming the Meyer's loop (ML), the sparing of which during surgery is crucial to preserve visual function. Defining its exact anatomy and accurately identifying its position remain challenging, even with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography and the most refined tracking procedure. We have developed an alternative tracking technique to detect the ML position.
   METHODS: We performed DTI studies in 26 patients undergoing resection of a temporo-parieto-occipital lesion. We then reconstructed the ORs of each patient using 2 techniques (the first developed by our team, the other taken from the literature), using the same tracking software and parameters. We evaluated the accuracy of each technique measuring 3 distances that define the ML position. We created 5 data groups and compared the 2 techniques. Finally, we compared our results with the results from 8 anatomic dissection studies and other tractographic studies.
   RESULTS: Our findings show that our technique allows a more accurate definition of the ML position. We found a statistically significant (P<0.05) difference for all the distances between the 2 techniques; our results resemble those obtained in dissection studies. Our technique is also easy to perform and repeatable.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our tracking technique may be of marked interest for the evaluation and anatomic definition of the ML position, particularly for neurosurgeons approaching the anterior temporal region.

AB BACKGROUND: The application of laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) for intracranial lesions in the posterior fossa tumors remains challenging due to the smaller size of this compartment as well as the thickness and angle of the occipital bone. In this study, we reviewed our experience with this treatment modality for posterior fossa lesions.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our series of 8 patients with posterior fossa tumors treated with LITT from an Institutional Review Board-approved brain tumor database (2012-2017) of more than 200 cases at our institution.
   RESULTS: The 8 patients underwent LITT targeting 3 metastases, 2 pilocytic astrocytomas, 2 zones of radiation necrosis after radiosurgery, and 1 glioblastoma (GBM). The mean preoperative lesion volume was 4.35 cm(3). A 6 months postsurgery, the mean lesion volume had decreased from 9.64 cm(3) to 5.72 cm(3). Two of the tumors (the GBM and a metastatic adenocarcinoma) progressed after 8.5 and 7.5 months, respectively, with mortality after 1.1 and 1.6 years, respectively. Surgical resection was performed in a patient with metastatic adenocarcinoma tumor at 7.7 months after LITT. All other lesions remained stable or were diminished at a median follow-up of 14.8 months (range, 0.4-37.5 months). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the first postoperative day, showed an increase in mean tumor-related edema volume from 9.45 cm(3) to 14.10 cm(3). After a postoperative follow-up of at least 1 month, this mean decreased to 8.70 cm(3). One case each of transient partial unilateral sixth cranial nerve palsy, superficial wound infection, and a late obstructive hydrocephalus were noted postoperatively. No mortality was associated with the procedure.
   CONCLUSIONS: LITT is a safe and feasible treatment modality even in challenging locations like the posterior fossa. However, surgical indications should be tailored for each individual patient based on the size and location of tumor.

TI Tailoring Endoscopic Approach to Colloid Cysts of the Third Ventricle: A

DT Article
DE Approach; Classification; Colloid cyst; Monro; Navigation;
   Neuroendoscopy; Radicality; Third ventricle
ID TECHNICAL NOTE; CASE SERIES; RESECTION; NEUROENDOSCOPY; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Endoscopic removal of third ventricular colloid cysts has grown in popularity. The biggest issues concern radicality, cure or at least long-term control of the disease, and endoscopic remnants. Technologic advances in instrumentation and introduction of novel tools have greatly improved endoscopic results. Deeper knowledge of surrounding anatomy and awareness that colloid cysts vary in their position (foraminal or retroforaminal) can further improve with the selection of a tailored approach for each patient.
   METHODS: During the last 12 years, 22 colloid cysts were treated endoscopically in our centers. Cysts were classified into 3 groups: A, foraminal (n = 6); B, foraminal with retroforaminal extension (n = 10); C, retroforaminal (n = 6). The following entry points and trajectories were selected: precoronal foraminal (n = 7), precoronal retroforaminal (n = 4), precoronal combined retroforaminal/foraminal (n = 5), supraorbital foraminal (n = 6). Navigation guidance was used in 17 cases.
   RESULTS: Major complications resulted in permanent deficits in 1 case, and 2 other patients experienced transient memory impairment. Remnants were noted by surgeon's intraoperative assessment in 6 cases; only 2 remnants were large, whereas the others were small bits of coagulated cyst stem. In 18 cases, no remnant was found on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging.
   CONCLUSIONS: A traditional precoronal transforaminal approach should be considered only for pure foraminal cysts (group A), as the retroforaminal component is poorly controlled. Retroforaminal cysts (groups B and C) should be resected through a retroforaminal transpellucidum inter-fornicialis route. A supraorbital transforaminal approach is a more versatile approach suitable for most cases.

AB BACKGROUND: The volume of activated tissue (VTA) model attempts to represent in 3 dimensions the diffusion of the current provided by the deep brain stimulation lead on brain structures. The objective of the present study was to assess the correlations among the VTA, activation of the corticospinal tract, and the intraoperative side effect (ISE) threshold.
   METHODS: This double-blind,single-center study was performed between September 2016 and July 2017. We identified 2 groups for statistical analysis: the entire study population and a subset of patients with additional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data for determining the location of the pyramidal tract. We determined the intensity threshold at which the VTA reached the border of the target nucleus (referred to as the VTAn) and the intensity threshold when the VTA reached the pyramidal tract (VTAndti). In each group of patients, we studied the correlations between the ISE threshold and the VTAn or VTAndti threshold.
   RESULTS: Fifteen patients were included in the study. In both groups, there was a significant correlation between the VTA intensity threshold and the ISE threshold (P = 0.018; r = 0.31 for VTAn in the entire study population). The correlation was stronger in the subset of patients with valid tractography data (P = 0.002; r = 0.5 for VTAndti).
   CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first to show a relationship between the intensity threshold as determined by the use of the VTA and the ISE threshold. The correlation between the clinical features and the VTA appears to be stronger in the model based on a combination of high-resolution anatomic data and interpretable DTI data.

AB OBJECTIVE: With increasing use of the endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach, wider attention is being paid to treatment and prevention of its complications. The aim of this study was to determine whether lumbar drainage (LD) has been effective in preventing and treating postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (poCSF) leakage or in assisting in achieving tumor gross total removal (GTR).
   METHODS: Retrospective analysis of purely endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal cases at a single center between 2008 and 2017 was done. We studied intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid (ioCSF) and poCSF leakage rates, duration of hospitalization, and GTR rate of the lesions, comparing patients with and without LD.
   RESULTS: Among 811 endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal procedures, LD was used in 38 cases. There was no statistically significant difference between patients with and without LD with regard to incidence of ioCSF leakage. A statistically significant difference was found in obese patients with LD, who had an apparently increased rate of poCSF leak. The length of stay of patients with LD was significantly longer than the control group without LD. The GTR rate was also higher in patients without LD.
   CONCLUSIONS: Use of LD is correlated with longer immobilization and hospitalization without providing statistically significant advantages in terms of prevention or treatment of ioCSF and/or poCSF in low-risk and high-risk patients. Moreover, LD was not helpful in achieving GTR of tumors.

AB BACKGROUND: Vascular pineal malformations are rare and technically demanding lesions. Because the locations of these lesions, endovascular techniques and radiosurgery have been increasingly used in the recent decades to accomplish safe occlusion. Nevertheless, microsurgical treatment may be required sometimes.
   METHODS: We present a retrospective review of the vascular pineal malformations operated by the senior author. Moreover, we report illustrative cases for the various types of vascular lesions with a careful analysis of the different microsurgical stages.
   RESULTS: Eighteen patients with pineal vascular lesions were operated on between 1980 and 2015: 6 patients had vein of Galen malformations, 5 plexiform arteriovenous malformations, 6 cavernous malformations, and 1 patient had a ruptured medial posterior choroidal artery aneurysm. A complete resection and occlusion was possible in all vascular malformations.
   CONCLUSIONS: The pineal region is an infrequent but challenging location for vascular lesions. A careful and step-wise operative strategy for the different types of vascular lesion is paramount to accomplish an effective and safe microsurgical treatment when other alternatives fail or are not available.

AB OBJECTIVE: To report the rate of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) use in vertebral column tumor surgery.
   METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database (2012-2014) was queried to identify patients who underwent spinal fusion for vertebral column tumors (primary benign, primary malignant, or metastatic). The rate of BMP-2 use was calculated, and patient and operative factors associated with its use were also investigated.
   RESULTS: We identified 9375 patients who underwent fusion surgery for spinal tumors between 2012 and 2014, with 540 cases using BMP-2 (5.8%). Preoperative diagnosis revealed that the rate of BMP-2 use in primary benign tumor surgery was 4.9%, 7.6% for primary malignant tumors, and 5.7% for metastatic lesions (P = 0.607). The overall complication rate was 13.2% (13.4% in the NO-BMP-2 group vs. 11.1% in the BMP-2 group; P = 0.504). Patients who received this growth factor were less likely to have epidural spinal cord compression at presentation (37.0% vs. 49.2%; P = 0.014), and more likely to have elective surgery (53.7% vs. 37.7%; P < 0.001). Analysis of hospital location indicated that the highest use of BMP-2 was in the South (7.4% rate; P = 0.002). There was no statistical difference between age, sex, insurance status, comorbidities, the presence of a pathologic fracture, or the use of inpatient radiotherapy or chemotherapy between patients who received BMP-2 and controls.
   CONCLUSIONS: BMP-2 has been used off-label to promote arthrodesis; however, its use in patients with spinal tumors is controversial. In this national study, BMP-2 use was highest in the South, in patients without epidural cord compression at presentation, and in elective cases.

AB OBJECTIVE: Chiari malformation type I is typified by the downward herniation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, which can impede cerebrospinal fluid circulation and may lead to syringomyelia. The usual symptoms of this condition are neck pain and posterior headaches on Valsalva maneuver. Different surgical procedures have been described for cranio-cervical decompression (CCD), without a consensus being reached about the best suited technique. The primary end point of this study was to compare efficacy and complications rate of CCD using dural peeling (DPe) versus duraplasty (DP). The secondary end point was to find predictive factors of success of DPe.
   METHODS: Twenty-eight consecutive patients with Chiari malformation type I (12 women and 16 men) requiring CCD were enrolled at our institution between August 2011 and November 2015. Ten patients (35.7%) underwent DP, and 18 (64.3%) DPe. A standardized magnetic resonance imaging protocol was performed before and at least 3 months after surgery. Symptomatic outcome was evaluated at the last follow-up visit.
   RESULTS: Overall complications were more frequent in the DP (4 patients, 70%) group than in the DPe (none) group (P < 0.05). All patients in the DP group improved clinically but only 12 patients (66.7%) in the DPe group (P = 0.1). Morphologic evolution at magnetic resonance imaging was similar in both groups. A moderate trend for changes in cerebellar tonsil conformation was shown in patients with clinical improvement (P = 0.07). Predictive factors of clinical improvement after DPe cannot be identified.
   CONCLUSIONS: CCD with DPe was less risky than with DP but had a lower responsive rate (66.7% vs. 100). Larger studies are therefore warranted to assess predictive factors of success of CCD with DPe.

AB BACKGROUND: The use of microsurgery for aneurysm clipping has decreased considerably in recent years. This study was conducted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of surgical treatment of intracranial aneurysms even in less-developed countries.
   METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of the medical records of 320 patients with 416 aneurysms treated with microsurgical clipping at a single neurosurgical center in Brazil between 2008 and 2016. We evaluated postoperative outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at the time of hospital discharge, treatment efficacy by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) performed post-operatively, and mortality.
   RESULTS: The 320 patients with aneurysms included 228 patients with ruptured aneurysms and 92 with unruptured aneurysms. Overall, 81 (26.3%) had a poor outcome (mRS score >2), and the other 227 (73.4%) had a good outcome. The presence of a ruptured aneurysm was a statistically significant factor for poor outcome (P < 0.001) and mortality (P < 0.015). Giant and large aneurysms were also associated with poor outcome (P = 0.004). When analyzed separately, unruptured aneurysms with poor outcome were only associated with aneurysm size. Among the patients with ruptured aneurysms, those with Hunt and Hess (HH) grade >2 on hospital admission had unfavorable outcomes (P < 0.0001). Among the patients who underwent postoperative DSA, 207 (89.8%) had complete aneurysm occlusion and 24 (10.2%) had residual aneurysms, with reoperation required in 8 cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgical treatment of intracranial aneurysms is an effective and safe method.

DT Article
DE Hemorrhagic stroke; Moyamoya disease; Therapy
ID BYPASS-SURGERY; OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND: Therapeutic strategies for managing hemorrhagic moyamoya disease (MMD) remain controversial. In this study, we investigated the optimal therapy for hemorrhagic MMD.
   METHODS: In accordance with the PRISMA statement, we searched through relevant articles and references from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane database, and performed a network meta-analysis using R version 3.4.4 software.
   RESULTS: A total of 9 articles (including 1050 patients) were included in our analysis. Of these 1050 patients, 557 underwent surgical revascularization (including direct and indirect bypass), and the remaining 493 patients were managed with a conservative treatment regimen. A pooled analysis revealed that surgical revascularization was superior to the conservative treatment regimen in decreasing the rate of recurrent stroke events (odds ratio [OR], 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.65), including ischemic stroke recurrence (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12-0.79) and hemorrhage recurrence (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.26-0.79), but not in reducing mortality (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.24-1.17). Moreover, the incidence of recurrent stroke in the direct bypass cohort was lower than that for either the conservative treatment cohort (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.15-0.58) or the indirect bypass cohort (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.18-0.87). However, the ratios showed no statistically significant difference between the latter 2 cohorts (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.33-1.68).
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical revascularization, especially a direct bypass regimen, may be the optimal strategy for treating hemorrhagic MMD.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the surgical results of unilateral lumbar discectomy in patients with bilateral leg pain and discuss short-and long-term outcomes within the limits of lumbar decompression.
   METHODS: We analyzed 60 patients with unilateral disc herniation who underwent unilateral lumbar discectomy and hemipartial laminectomy between 2014 and 2017. Group 1 (30 patients) had bilateral leg pain and unilateral lumbar disc herniation. Pain lateralization was determined radiologically. Group 2 (30 patients) had unilateral leg pain and unilateral lumbar disc herniation. Pain scores were preoperatively evaluated with visual analog scale (VAS) for both legs and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) for overall life quality. In both groups, surgery was performed on the ipsilateral side of the herniated disc. Scores were repeated on postoperative day 1 and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months later. VAS score differences for pain lateralization and disc levels were compared in group 1. ODI score differences were compared between both groups. Results were statistically analyzed.
   RESULTS: VAS score differences were statistically significant at all follow-up time points in patients with ipsilateral and contralateral pain. VAS score differences between L4-L5 and L5-S1 level discopathies were statistically insignificant for all time points in both groups. All postoperative ODI score decreases for all time points were statistically significant (P < 0.001) for both groups, whereas the differences between groups 1 and 2 were statistically insignificant.
   CONCLUSIONS: Conventional lumbar disc surgery alone is sufficient for the ipsilateral side of radiologically demonstrated disc herniation in patients with bilateral leg pain.

   OUTCOMES; GLIOBLASTOMA; RESECTION; SURVIVAL; EUROQOL
AB OBJECTIVE: Few studies have assessed patient-reported quality of life (QoL) in patients with glioma undergoing surgery, and even fewer have provided longitudinal data. Accordingly, there is little knowledge about the changes of QoL over time in patients with glioma. We sought to explore perioperative and postoperative development of generic QoL during the first 6 months after primary glioma surgery.
   METHODS: A total of 136 adult patients undergoing primary surgery for high-grade glioma (HGG) or low-grade glioma (LGG) were prospectively included in this explorative longitudinal study. Patient-reported QoL was measured with the generic tool EQ-5D 3L preoperatively and at 1 and 6 months after surgery.
   RESULTS: At group level, there was no difference in EQ-5D index values in patients with HGG compared with patients with LGG at baseline or at 1 month. At 6 months, EQ-5D index values in patients with HGG had deteriorated significantly (P < 0.001) but remained stable in patients with LGG. Individual level QoL development was more diverse. American Society of Anesthesiologists class >= 3, resection grades other than gross total resection, and HGG were identified as independent predictors for negative development of QoL between 1 and 6 months after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: At group level, development of generic QoL between baseline and 1 and 6 months postoperatively seems to follow the natural disease trajectories of LGG and HGG, with deterioration in patients with HGG at 6 months. Individual development of QoL is heterogeneous. HGG, resection grades other than gross total resection, and preoperative comorbidity are predictors of postoperative impairment of QoL.

AB BACKGROUND: Radical treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) remains a challenge despite recent advances in endovascular, microsurgical, and stereotactic radiosurgery treatments. The radical removal of AVMs with prevention of hemorrhage can be achieved through either single or combined modalities. Our retrospective study summarizes the safety and efficacy of combined endovascular embolization and microsurgical removal of AVMs in 49 consecutive patients in the hybrid operating room (hOR).
   METHODS: Patients underwent nonhybrid (i.e., endovascular, stereotactic radiosurgery, observation, combination) or hybrid (i.e., endovascular with microsurgery in hOR) treatment. The variables analyzed included age, sex, hospitalization time, Spetzler-Martin/Buffalo grades, clinical symptoms, previous treatment, intraoperative digital angiographic (iDSA) findings, postsurgical treatment, operation duration, complications, obliteration rate, and remnants.
   RESULTS: Of 18 patients treated in the hOR, 15 (83%) presented with Spetzler-Martin grades I and II and were younger than those treated with other modalities (mean age, 41 vs. 46 years). Thirteen (87%) patients were admitted with signs of hemorrhage after AVM rupture. The initial surgical plan was modified in 3 (17%) of 18 cases based on iDSA findings. All patients who eventually underwent microsurgical removal of AVMs showed neither postinterventional remnant nor new neurologic signs and symptoms. Complications included 1 postoperative epidural hematoma and 1 vasospasm during endovascular treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of AVMs in the hOR offers the possibility to adapt surgical approaches based on iDSA findings after intraoperative embolization, thus achieving better clinical and radiologic results. Radical treatment of AVMs with low Spetzler-Martin grades by combining endovascular and microsurgical techniques in the hOR was technically feasible, effective, and safe.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the radiologic and clinical outcomes after lumbar fusion intervention and to compare the established posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) technique and dynamic hybrid instrumentation (topping off).
   METHODS: In this prospective randomized trial, all patients who presented with degenerative changes to the lumbar spine (L2-S1) were included and randomized in 2 groups: patients who underwent the 360 degrees-fusion procedure in PLIF (group 1: control group) and those patients who underwent fusion surgery with additional hybrid instrumentation (Dynesys-Transition-Optima [Zimmer Spine Inc., Denver, Colorado, USA]) cranial to the rigid fixed segment (group 2: intervention group). Patients' demographics were documented and follow-up visits were conducted after 6 weeks and then stepwise after 6 up to 36 months. Each follow-up visit included assessment of quality of life and pain using specific questionnaires (Core Outcome Measurements Index, Short-Form 36, and Oswestry Disability Index) as well as radiologic evaluation with the focus on the adjacent level alteration.
   RESULTS: Fifteen patients per group met the inclusion criteria, and after 36 months, the loss to follow-up was 20%. At the maximum follow-up time, the overall risk for adjacent segment degeneration was substantial (i.e., 24.14%), independent of the surgical procedure. Material failure was observed in 17.24%. Although no significant difference was observed between both groups, all patients presented with postoperative improvement regarding the clinical scores.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present study cannot support the safety of dynamic hybrid devices in those cases if the reduction of adjacent segment degeneration is the main target, especially regarding the reported implant failure rates and the similar clinical outcomes between the both groups.

ID LUMBAR SCOLIOSIS; BALANCE; THORACOLUMBAR; SURGERY; CURVES
AB BACKGROUND: Choosing the fusion level for posterior fusion in patients with Lenke 5C adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is highly associated with coronal balance. Previous studies indicated that in patients with lowest end vertebra tilt >25 degrees, surgeons could extend distal fusion to avoid coronal imbalance (CIB). This study aimed to assess the risk factors for CIB in Lenke 5C scoliosis and to discuss how to select fusion level.
   METHODS: We reviewed 59 patients with Lenke 5C AIS in 1 institution with at least 2 years follow-up from 2010 to 2015. Preoperative and 3-month and 2-year postoperative follow-up radiographs were measured using several specific measurements related to coronal balance. Patients were categorized into an LEV (lower end vertebra) group and an LEVD1 group.
   RESULTS: CIB was found in 6/31 patients in the LEVD1 group at final follow-up and not found in the LEV group at the first or final follow-up. The C7 plumb line shifted to the convex side of the central sacral vertical line in 47/59 patients, including all of the 19 patients with CIB after surgery. Patients who underwent fusion at LEVD1 with >25 degrees LEV tilt also showed poor results regarding CIB. Statistically, coronal balance at the final follow-up was correlated with preoperative bending lumbosacral hemicurve (P = 0.002) and all 6 patients with CIB had bending lumbosacral hemicurve >15 degrees. No significant difference was found in Scoliosis Research Society-22 questionnaire scores between the 2 groups at 2-year-follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Distal fusion extension at LEVD1 is more likely to result in CIB at the first and final follow-up, especially when the bending lumbosacral hemicurve is >15 degrees. Fusion at LEVD1 should not be chosen when LEV is at L4.

TI Assessment of Biomechanical Changes After Sacroiliac Joint Fusion by
   Application of the 3-Dimensional Motion Analysis Technique
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Biomechanical study; Fusion surgery; Range of motion; Sacroiliac joint
ID LOW-BACK-PAIN; FRACTURES; STABILIZATION
AB BACKGROUND: Sacroiliac (SI) joint motion is complex and is poorly understood overall. In this study we evaluated a new biomechanical method developed to provide more insight into SI joint movement and to elucidate biomechanical changes after SI joint fusion surgery in a one-leg standing model.
   METHODS: Eight lumbosacral cadaver specimens (L5-pelvis specimens, age 28-57 years, 6 female and 2 male) were used in this experiment. We analyzed the changes in range of motion (ROM) in single-plane motion and mobility in 3 groups of patients: intact, unilateral fusion, and bilateral fusion groups. For statistical analysis, we used repeated-measures analysis of variance to compare SI joint ROM among the 3 groups. iFuse implants were prepared using the standard posterior placement technique. Pure-moment multidirectional bending tests were performed in each direction (nutation and counternutation, axial rotation, and lateral bending).
   RESULTS: Average ROM in single-plane motion and mobility of the intact SI joint were 4.5 +/- 3.3 degrees and 4.8 +/- 3.4 degrees, respectively in nutation-counternutation; 2.9 +/- 2.1 degrees and 3.3 +/- 2.3 degrees, respectively, in axial rotation; and 1.5 +/- 1.5 degrees and 2.8 +/- 2.5 degrees, respectively, in lateral bending. We observed statistically significantly (P = 0.05) greater mobility in lateral moment testing than in single motion testing. Comparisons among the intact, unilateral fusion, and bilateral fusion groups showed statistically significant differences in the lateral moment test.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that our new biomechanical method for SI joint evaluation may provide improved insight into SI joint movement and biomechanical changes after SI joint fusion surgery in a one-leg standing model.

AB BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an extremely challenging malignancy to treat. Although temozolomide (TMZ) is a standard treatment regimen, many patients with GBM develop chemoresistance. The aim of this study was to identify a DNA repair-related gene signature to better stratify patients treated with TMZ.
   METHODS: We selected 89 cases of primary GBM (pGBM) from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas RNA-seq dataset as the training cohort, whereas The Cancer Genome Atlas RNA-seq and Gene Set Enrichment (GSE) 16011 mRNA array sets were used as validation cohorts. Regression analysis and linear risk score assessment were performed to build a DNA repair-related signature. We used Kaplan-Meier analysis to evaluate the predictive value of the signature for overall survival (OS) in the different groups. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to determine whether the 5-gene signature could independently predict OS.
   RESULTS: Using our 5-gene signature panel of APEX1, APRT, PARP2, PMS2L2, and POLR2L, we divided patients with pGBM into high-and low-risk groups. Patients with a low-risk score were predicted to have favorable survival and greater benefit from TMZ therapy compared with patients from the high-risk group (P<0.05). Moreover, receiver operating characteristic curves showed that the multigene signature was the most sensitive and specific model for survival prediction (P<0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with pGBM, classification based on a risk score determined using a 5-gene panel indicated different OS and reaction to TMZ. The findings in this study demonstrate that this unique 5-gene signature could be a novel model to predict OS and provide accurate therapy for patients with pGBM.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of screw placement and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing occipitocervical fusion.
   METHODS: Patients who underwent occipitocervical fusion with O-arm-based navigation were retrospectively reviewed between January 2015 and December 2017. The patients' characteristics, clinical and radiographic outcomes, and surgical complications were recorded and analyzed. Cervical screw insertion accuracy was evaluated using the Richter scale.
   RESULTS: Thirty consecutive patients (11 male and 19 female) with an average treatment age of 40.03 +/- 15.19 years were studied. The most common cause was atlantoaxial instability combined with Chiari malformation (63.33%). Weakness (76.67%) and paresthesia (70.00%) were the most common symptoms. Eighty-six occipital and 139 cervical screws were placed using an O-arm-assisted navigation system. In total, 130 (93.53%) cervical screws were graded as group A and 9 (6.47%) as group B. The optimal accuracy rate was 88.41% (61 of 69 screws) in the first 15 patients and 98.57% (69 of 70 screws) in the subsequent 15 patients. The mean follow-up time was 7.50 +/- 5.70 months. The mean Japanese Orthopedic Association scores were 13.30 +/- 2.41 preoperatively and 15.30 +/- 1.60 at final follow-up (P < 0.001), and the mean recovery rate in the Japanese Orthopedic Association score was 53.26 +/- 33.82%. Clinical improvement was seen in 25 patients (83.33%), whereas no change was observed in 5 patients (16.67%). The overall complication rate was 6.67% (2/30), with 1 intraoperative vertebral artery injury and 1 postoperative screw loosening.
   CONCLUSION: Occipitocervical fusion with O-arm-based navigation is effective and safe for treating instability of the craniovertebral junction. Intraoperative navigation can help surgeons insert screws accurately.

AB BACKGROUND: Haptoglobin (Hp) comprising 2 light (a) and 2 heavy (b) chains has an antioxidant effect following free hemoglobin binding. Among 3 phenotypes-Hp1-1 (two alpha 1), Hp2-1 (alpha 1 and alpha 2), and Hp2-2 (two alpha 2)-a greater protective effect for toxic-free hemoglobin was reported for Hp2-2 compared with Hp1-1. However, few studies have focused on the association of Hp2-1 with outcomes. This study examined alpha 1 and alpha 2 expression, and evaluated the correlation of Hp2-1 with outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
   METHODS: Eighty-seven patients were enrolled prospectively, including 12 in the Hp1-1 group (13.8%), 36 in the Hp2-1 group (41.4%), and 39 in the Hp2-2 group (44.8%). Phenotypes were confirmed by Western blot analysis. The relative band intensities were measured as a subunit intensities normalized to albumin intensities and expressed as median (interquartile range). The differences in a intensities according to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), angiographic vasospasm (AV), and outcome were analyzed.
   RESULTS: DCI and AV were more frequently associated with Hp2-2 than with Hp1-1 (DCI: 21 [53.8%] vs. 3 [25.0%]; AV: 22 [56.4%] vs. 3 [25.0%]). The alpha 1 intensities of Hp2-1 without DCI and AV were significantly higher than those with DCI and AV (without DCI: 0.70 [interquartile range (IQR), 0.54-0.89]; with DCI: 0.24 [IQR, 0.14e0.32]; P < 0.001; without AV: 0.65 [IQR, 0.32-0.88]; with AV: 0.32 [IQR, 0.17-0.67]; P = 0.046). No significant difference was noted with alpha 2 intensities. The alpha 1 (P = 0.359) and alpha 2 (P = 0.233) intensities did not differ significantly according to outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: Higher alpha 1 intensities in Hp2-1 are associated with a lower risk of DCI and AV. The degree of alpha 1 intensity may provide additional information about the individual risk of secondary injury following SAH in patients with Hp2-1.

AB BACKGROUND: Carotid Doppler sonography has been used routinely in the screening for restenosis after carotid artery stenting (CAS) by applying the criteria of flow velocity; however, computed tomography angiography (CTA) enables us to detect restenosis directly and has some advantages that help to overcome the limitations of Carotid Doppler sonography. We aimed to investigate the incidence of restenosis with CTA and to identify factors related to restenosis after CAS.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 225 patients (235 arteries, mean age of 71.9 +/- 7.7 years) who had undergone CTA of the neck for the evaluation of restenosis after CAS between July 2002 and June 2012. We assessed the cumulative incidence of restenosis (>50%) and the predictors of restenosis after CAS.
   RESULTS: During 1064.4 patient-years of follow-up (mean 4.5 years; range 1-9.7 years), the incidence of restenosis was 10.2% (24/ 235). The cumulative rate of freedom from restenosis was 94.1%, 88.8%, and 86.7% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The statistically significant factors associated with restenosis after CAS were residual stenosis (adjusted odds ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.11, P < 0.01) and high-grade (>50%) calcification (adjusted odds ratio 6.04, 95% confidence interval 1.29-28.36, P = 0.02) on multivariate analysis.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that carotid arteries with high-grade calcification were prone to develop restenosis after CAS. Regular follow-up should be performed for the monitoring of restenosis after CAS in patients with highly calcified carotid plaques.

AB OBJECTIVE: In percutaneous cervical nucleoplasty (PCN) a portion of the nucleus tissue is ablated using the Coblation technique. Re-surgery is an important factor for the clinical outcome. However, the rate of subsequent surgery after PCN is still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of an additional open surgery after PCN in a retrospective of more than 10 years.
   METHODS: Retrospective observational study. Consecutive patients with PCN between 2005 and 2007 were included. Patient's satisfaction was evaluated using McNab's outcome criteria. The necessity of an additional open surgery at the cervical spine, the period between PCN and the fusion, and the treated levels were analyzed.
   RESULTS: One hundred thirty-three patients were included. The follow-up time was longer than 5 years in 31.6% of patients and longer than 10 years in 6.0% of patients. The short-term success rate was 70.7%; however, subsequent surgery was performed in 19.5% of patients. Overall, 57.7 % of reoperations were performed during the first year after PCN. In patients with a good result after PCN, subsequent surgery was less frequent, and the interval between PCN and additional surgery was larger (P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study reporting the frequency of re-surgery after PCN. Overall, 70.7% patient satisfaction was observed after 1 month. This result is worsened because of a re-surgery rate of 19.5%. The data from this study suggest that PCN is a poor replacement for conventional open surgery. Degeneration of the disc is progressive despite or because of PCN.

AB BACKGROUND: Pediatric hydrocephalus is a health burden for East African countries, with an estimated incidence of 6000 new cases per year. The objective of this study is to describe the epidemiology and surgical outcomes of patients treated for pediatric hydrocephalus in the single neurosurgical center of Zanzibar.
   METHODS: From December 2016 to December 2017, we prospectively collected data on all patients admitted with the diagnosis of hydrocephalus. Information was gathered regarding demographics, maternal health, preoperative imaging, surgical procedures, and postsurgical complications.
   RESULTS: We collected data on 63 patients. Average age was 203 days, and gender was 49.2% female and 50.8% male. All mothers of patients attended an antenatal clinic for routine screening during pregnancy. Folic acid prophylaxis was used by 9.5% of the mothers during pregnancy. At the first visit, 46.0% of patients presented with signs of infection, 20.6% with congenital abnormalities, and 20.6% with seizures. Regarding etiology of hydrocephalus, 22.2% of all cases were uncertain; 20.6% were associated with neural tube defects; 39.7% were post-infectious hydrocephalus; 3.2% were aqueduct stenosis; 4.8% were associated with brain tumor; and 9.6% were malformative. We performed 7 endoscopic third ventriculostomies and placed 40 ventriculoperitoneal shunts. The complication rate at follow-up was 12.5%.
   CONCLUSIONS: It seems that hydrocephalus in Zanzibar has similar causes, progression, and complication rates to previous reports from other African hospitals. Further studies of postinfectious hydrocephalus need to be conducted because recent findings suggest that it is a potentially preventable cause of the disease.

AB BACKGROUND: Our previous studies have shown that mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) provides a neuroprotective effect against ischemia/reperfusion injury and is also involved in inflammatory disease models. This study investigates the potential role and mechanism of MANF in acute brain damage after traumatic brain injury (TBI).
   METHODS: The model of TBI was induced by Feeney free falling methods with male Sprague-Dawley rats. The expression of MANF, 24 hours after TBI, was detected by the immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, Western blot, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction techniques. After treatment with recombinant human MANF after TBI, assessment was conducted 24 hours later for brain water content, cerebral edema volume in magnetic resonance imaging, neurobehavioral testing, and Evans blue extravasation. Moreover, by the techniques of Western blot and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, the expression of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha) and P65 was also analyzed to explore the underlying protective mechanism of MANF.
   RESULTS: At 24 hours after TBI, we found that endogenous MANF was widely expressed in the rat's brain tissues and different types of cells. Treatment with a high dose of recombinant human MANF (20 mu g/20 mu L) significantly increased the modified Garcia score, and reduced brain water content as well as cerebral edema volume on magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, MANF alleviated not only the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) but also the expressions of interleukin 1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha messenger RNA and protein. Besides, the activation of P65 was also inhibited.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MANF provides a neuroprotective effect against acute brain injury after TBI, via attenuating blood-brain barrier disruption and intracranial neuroinflammation; the inhibition of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway might be a potential mechanism.

DT Article

   Resource allocation; Timeframes; Wait times
ID GLOBAL SURGERY; AFRICA; HYDROCEPHALUS
AB BACKGROUND: In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), 11.8% of the need for neurosurgical care is met. Delays in seeking and receiving care may further exacerbate this situation. Objective analysis of delay and its consequences is contingent on reference to established resource-appropriate acceptable timeframes. This study sought to 1) establish an estimate of the landscape of care provided in LMICs and 2) explore reasonable timeframes for various stages of patient-health care interaction.
   METHODS: Consensus input from neurosurgeons in select LMICs was collected; 1 high-income country was included for comparison. In phase 1, participants were asked to select neurosurgical procedures performed at their centers. In phase 2, based on procedures shared among all LMICs, representative case scenarios were generated and participants provided input on acceptable timeframes for each stage of patient-health care interaction: 1) presentation to health services, 2) diagnosis by primary care physician, 3) referral to neurosurgical specialist care, and 4) definitive neurosurgical management.
   RESULTS: Twenty neurosurgeons across 18 centers were identified; 12 participated in phase 1 and 7 in phase 2. The range of procedures offered was broad, similar in scope to high-income countries, and included pediatric and adult neurosurgery, trauma, degenerative spine, and hemorrhagic stroke. Acceptable timeframes had wide ranges in certain cases; however, the overall trend showed agreement between the participants.
   CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory analysis identified reasonable timeframes for the provision of neurosurgical care in LMICs. If validated, these data can be used to more objectively assess the prevalence of delay in neurosurgical care in individual LMICs, along with its consequences.

   CSF
AB BACKGROUND: Ventriculitis is a serious complication when using external ventricular drains (EVDs). Bactericidal silver coating has been reported to reduce risk of infection. In the clinical setting, the diagnosis is often made based on symptoms and analyses of cerebrospinal fluid, with treatment initiated before infection is verified by culture. The bactericidal effect might not correlate with a reduced rate of clinically diagnosed infections. This retrospective study aimed to analyze if use of silver-coated EVDs is associated with a reduced rate of ventriculitis.
   METHODS: During 1 year, clinical routine was changed from inserting noncoated catheters to silver-coated catheters. Rate of ventriculitis was compared between patient groups based on catheter type. To examine the clinical impact of silver coating, ventriculitis was defined as cases where antibiotic treatment was initiated on clinical suspicion.
   RESULTS: Among 296 patients (186 noncoated and 110 silver-coated catheters), 18.9% were treated for ventriculitis, with 21.0% in the noncoated group and 15.5% in the silver-coated group (P = 0.242). Silver coating did not reduce the rate of positive cultures. Duration of EVD treatment was the single significant risk factor for ventriculitis. Silver-coated catheters did not reduce the need for cerebrospinal fluid shunt placement, days with antibiotics, days with EVD, or days in the intensive care unit.
   CONCLUSIONS: The previously reported bactericidal effect of silver-coated EVDs did not alter the clinical course to significantly reduce the number of treated cases of ventriculitis. The introduction of silver-coated EVDs cannot be motivated by reduced use of antibiotics or shorter hospital stay.

AB OBJECTIVE: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are infiltrating, aggressive tumors that are soft tissue sarcomas. This article describes 3 patients with a tumorous swelling in the entire inferior alveolar nerve suspicious for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, which is particularly rare in the trigeminal nerve. Diagnostic tools, surgical proceedings, and reconstructive procedures are presented.
   METHODS: Three male patients (age range, 58-68 years) with numbness, pain, and mild swelling in the sensory area served by the mental nerve presented to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and underwent diagnostic work-up including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography, and biopsy of the clinically visible tumor mass with histopathologic and molecular pathologic analysis.
   RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging revealed the full extent of the tumor comprising the course of the entire mandibular nerve (1 case bilateral) starting in the trigeminal ganglion through the inferior alveolar nerve and ending in the mental foramen. Both a neurosurgical and a maxillofacial intervention with jaw replacement were necessary. Adjuvant radiation of intracranial closed resection margins and, in 1 case, of parts of the mandible was required.
   CONCLUSIONS: To reveal the full extent of tumor spread of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, sufficient preoperative imaging is crucial, as it is an important step in therapy planning. Magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography/computed tomography have the best prospect of success in depicting the full extent of disease. Radical surgical management is the treatment of choice, whereas radiochemotherapy has an ancillary part.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of long and short segment instrumentation after pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO) for thoracolumbar kyphosis caused by anky-losing spondylitis (AS).
   METHODS: Sixty-four consecutive AS patients were analyzed and divided into groups according to length of instrumentation. We defined short segment instrumentation (SSI) as construct length <7 levels (<= 3 levels above and below the osteotomy) (n = 17). By contrast, long segment instrumentation (LSI) was defined as construct length >= 7 levels (>= 4 levels above and >= 3 levels below the osteotomy) (n = 47). Both groups were matched cohorts. Radiographs were analyzed for correction, ossification, and complications.
   RESULTS: Correction loss in global kyphosis (GK) and lumbar lordosis (LL) of the LSI group was slightly higher than that of SSI group. Notably, a significantly higher modified Stokes Ankylosing Spondylitis Spinal Score (mSASSS) was noted in the SSI group. Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated that thoracic and lumbar spine mSASSS were significantly associated with correction loss in GK and LL, respectively. Two cases of proximal junctional kyphosis and 1 case of rod fracture occurred in the LSI group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both approaches were able to maintain sustained surgical outcomes. Short segment instrumentation is recommended for AS patients with bridging syndesmophytes. Long constructs are better indicated for patients without fully ossified anterior longitudinal ligaments. Nevertheless, extension of the length of instrumentation might not prevent complications such as proximal junctional kyphosis or rod fracture in patients without fully ossified vertebrae.

AB BACKGROUND: Moyamoya disease is a steno-occlusive disease of the circle of Willis with growth of pathologic collaterals. We compared functional perfusion imaging ([O-15] water-positron emission tomography [PET] with acetazolamide challenge) with conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography for determining indication for cerebral revascularization in patients with moyamoya.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective blinded analysis of individual imaging modalities (MRI, angiography, PET) and scored each modality for severity of disease in 21 untreated patients with moyamoya with 78 affected vascular territories.
   RESULTS: Positive predictive value to identify insufficient perfusion on angiography and MRI together was 98.3% as proven on combined PET/computed tomography. Negative predictive value to identify sufficient perfusion on angiography and/or MRI only was 60%. Negative predictive value to predict good perfusion on PET based on MRI (no infarctions in the respective territory) was only 17%. An assumed good perfusion based on the suggestion of good collaterals on angiography was correct in only 13.4% of cases. Positive predictive value (angiography of main vessel and weak or no collateralization) to predict insufficient perfusion on PET/computed tomography was 76.9%; negative predictive value (angiography of main vessel and strong collateralization) to identify good perfusion was 13.4%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Reliable evaluation of cerebral blood flow might not be possible with angiography and basic MRI alone. We strongly recommend additional functional imaging (e.g., [O-15] water-PET with acetazolamide challenge) to precisely evaluate the indication for cerebral revascularization.

   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to investigate factors related to MCID of health-related quality of life scores following instrumented LIF performed on a single-level adult LGIS.
   METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent instrumented LIF for single-level LGIS were reviewed. The inclusion criteria were adult patients who underwent L4-5 or L5-S1, underwent anterior lumbar interbody fusion or transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion with a posterior screw fixation, and had a minimum 36-month postoperative follow-up period. MCID was defined as having an improved score of visual analog scale (VAS) back and leg pain >3 and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) >12. Patients were subdivided into groups named "achievement" (A) and "nonachievement" (N) depending on their postoperative MCID for each health-related quality of life score category.
   RESULTS: One-hundred and five patients met the inclusion criteria. The overall achievement of MCID for VAS back, leg, and ODI was 80%, 73.3%, and 82.9%. MCID-VAS leg and ODI were less achieved at the L5-S1 level than at the L4-5 level. Postoperatively, disk height was higher and segmental lordosis (SL) was lower in group A of MCID-VAS leg. SL was lower in group A of MCID-ODI.
   CONCLUSIONS: We postulate that excessive SL does not affect lumbar lordosis; rather, it can result in lowering posterior disk height. The decrease in posterior DH may lead to a decreased foraminal height that, in turn, can lead to nerve root compression. Proper restoration of disk height and bone fusion is more important than restoration of more segmental lordosis or slip reduction for isthmic spondylolisthesis.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical efficacy of cortical bone trajectory (CBT) screws in the treatment of elderly patients with lumbar spinal tuberculosis.
   METHODS: A total of 45 elderly patients with lumbar spinal tuberculosis were allocated to 1 groups based on different surgical methods: 22 patients in group A received posterior CBT screw fixation combined with anterior debridement with a small incision and bone grafting, and 23 patients in group B underwent posterior pedicle screw fixation combined with anterior debridement with a small incision and bone grafting. The intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage volumes, Cobb angles, visual analogue scale scores, erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESRs), and Frankel grades before and after surgery were analyzed. The surgical complications and spinal fusion were also assessed.
   RESULTS: After a 3-month follow-up, 2 patients in group A and 3 patients in group B experienced anterior psoas muscle abscesses, which were cured by a second surgery. The remaining patients were healed by the first surgery. Spinal fusion after bone graft required 3 to 8 months (average, 4.9 months). There were no significant differences in surgery time, blood loss, drainage volume, and hospital stay between the 2 groups. The visual analogue scale scores, Cobb angles, ESRs, and Frankel grades were significantly improved after surgery in both groups.
   CONCLUSION: The CBT screws were not inferior to traditional pedicle screws. The application of CBT- screws fixation combined with anterior debridement with a small incision and bone grafting was an effective and safe method to treat elderly patients with lumbar spinal tuberculosis.

ID AUTOLOGOUS BLOOD INFUSION; INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE; PONTINE HEMORRHAGE
AB BACKGROUND: A successful animal brainstem hemorrhage model can be used to study pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms of neurologic deterioration or recovery and therapeutic interventions after the brainstem hemorrhage. Herein, we provide a reproducible and reliable model for rat brainstem hemorrhage and summarize our key points to success in modeling.
   METHODS: Twenty-four adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups and were injected with 30, 40, and 60 mu L autologous blood into the right pontine basal tegmentum after being sedated. The initial model was evaluated with neurobehavior testing, autopsy, and histopathology. The modeling conditions were modified in Group IV rats, and 20 more rats were used to check the reproducibility and reliability of the modified model. Finally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to confirm the brainstem hemorrhage.
   RESULTS: Only 6 rats had significant pontine hemorrhage in initial 3 groups on autopsy. Whereas after the modification, all Group IV rats had serious pontine hemorrhage, and modified conditions model had a 90% success rate. MRI confirmed a stable hematoma in the right basal tegmental pons with oval shape 24 hours after of blood injection. Histopathologically, there was significant perihematomal swelling, migration of inflammatory cells and structural changes in neuronal shape and contents.
   CONCLUSIONS: An ideal and repeatable rat brainstem hemorrhage model by injecting autologous blood stereotactically was created, and it mimics the natural onset of brainstem hemorrhage. This brainstem hemorrhage model shows promise that providing a better way for neurology researchers to investigate pathophysiologic procedure of brainstem intracranial hemorrhage and further explore the treatment.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine whether implantation of a newly designed nonfusion intracorporeal enhancement (NICE) system is an effective and safe way to treat osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF).
   METHODS: Thirteen patients with OVCF (10 women, 3 men; mean age 69 years, T11-L4) were included. From June 2014 to June 2016, all patients were treated with the NICE system. The clinical and radiologic results were evaluated preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 24 months follow-up based on the visual analog scale and the Oswestry Disability Index, radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography (height of fractured body and kyphosis Cobb angle).
   RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in pain intensity (visual analog scale score decreased from 8.3 preoperatively to 2.2 postoperatively, and decreased to 1.5 twenty-four months postoperatively). Also, a significant reduction was observed in that the mean Oswestry Disability Index decreased from 71.9% preoperatively to 17.6% after 24 months. The mean Cobb angle had a significant improvement, which decreased from 6.6 degrees preoperatively to 1.3 degrees postoperatively and then decreased to 1.2 degrees after 24 months. Height of fractured body improved significantly from 66.4% to 86.5% and slightly decreased to 82.4% after 24 months. No specific complications were identified to be associated with this technique.
   CONCLUSIONS: With a low complication rate, the clinical midterm results are satisfactory. The treatment of symptomatic OVCF with the NICE system is a safe and effective procedure.

   DISCORDANCE
AB BACKGROUND: The endoscopic endonasal approach has recently become an acceptable option for resection of all pituitary adenomas. We assessed biochemical outcome of endoscopic endonasal surgery in growth hormone (GH)-secreting adenomas, including remission rate, predictors of remission, and associated complications.
   METHODS: Sixty-eight consecutive patients with acromegaly who underwent endoscopic endonasal surgery were analyzed prospectively. Tumors were classified according to size, Knosp grade, and Hardy-Wilson classification. Biochemical remission was defined as normal serum insulin-like growth factor 1 level and either a suppressed GH serum level less than 0.4 mu g/L during an oral glucose tolerance test or a random GH level less than 1.0 mu g/L at least 3 months after surgery.
   RESULTS: Total biochemical remission rate was 64.7%. Gross total resection was achieved in 61 of the 68 patients (89.7%). Remission was achieved in 12 of 16 microadenomas (75%) and 32 of 52 macroadenomas (61.5%). Based on univariate logistic regression analysis, preoperative variables predictive of remission were age (P = 0.004), Knosp grade (P = 0.023), and preoperative GH levels (P = 0.042). Three patients (4.4%) experienced postoperative panhypopituitarism, and permanent diabetes insipidus was seen in 4 patients (5.9%). Two patients (2.9%) developed cerebrospinal fluid leaks, which were treated by lumbar puncture in one case and early surgical repair in the other case.
   CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic endonasal adenoma resection leads to a high rate of endocrinologic remission in GH-secreting adenomas with a low complication rate. Patients with older age, higher preoperative GH levels, and higher Knosp grades are less likely to achieve remission.

AB BACKGROUND: Ventriculostomy using the freehand pass method is subject to complications arising from misplacement of the catheter tip. This method may require multiple passes for successful catheterization. Methods of determining the burr-hole location (known as the Kocher point) were derived historically from European patients and may not be appropriate for other populations with different cranial shapes. This study examines the possibility that anatomic variation in interpopulation variation together with sexual dimorphism in cranial size and shape may contribute to this problem.
   METHODS: Sagittal and parasagittal measurements of the frontal bone were taken of 300 Thai (150 female, 150 male) crania and 300 American white (150 female, 150 male) crania. These measurements were compared to determine sexual dimorphism and interpopulation variation in size and shape.
   RESULTS: The measurements were statistically significantly larger in males than in females and on the right side than the left in both sexes in both Thai and American white samples. The frontal bone is significantly longer at the sagittal plane in Europeans of both sexes than in Thai, but in the parasagittal plane, there is no difference. This finding indicates a difference in frontal bone shape between the 2 populations and between males and females.
   CONCLUSIONS: The dimensions of the frontal bone vary between males and females and can vary among populations. The optimal location for the burr hole in freehand pass ventriculostomy may depend on both the gender and the ancestry of the patient.

ID LATERAL SUBOCCIPITAL APPROACH; RETROSIGMOID APPROACH
AB OBJECTIVE: Racial differences in anatomy of the cranium exist but have not been specifically considered in neurosurgical access planning. We sought to find differences in the anatomy of the posterior fossa in a cohort study consisting of Asian, African American, and Caucasian patients.
   METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging data of 60 Asian, 57 African American, and 70 Caucasian individuals were obtained from the Human Connectome Project. Measurements were done in axial, coronal, and sagittal planes in T2-weighted thin-sliced images. P values were calculated using 2-tailed Student t test. P < 0.05 was considered significant.
   RESULTS: We measured distance in millimeters from the z values (craniocaudal axis) from the internal acoustic meatus to the transition of the transverse sinus into the sigmoid sinus. We discovered significant differences across all races. Our results show that the junction of the transverse to sigmoid sinus is lowest in Caucasians followed by Asians and African Americans.
   CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in anatomy have practical implications in the retrosigmoid approach to the cerebellopontine angle. Based on our findings, the junction of the transverse sinus with the sigmoid sinus can differ up to 0.5 cm in the craniocaudal axis depending on race. As neuronavigation is not standard to the approach to the cerebellopontine angle, the study aimed to provide the neurosurgeon operating in the retrosigmoid area additional knowledge to avoid sinus injury with subsequent complications, such as blood loss, sinus occlusion, or air embolism.

AB BACKGROUND: Surgical resection of parasellar meningiomas is a challenging operation that traditionally has been performed with a large pterional or orbitozygomatic craniotomy. In this study, we report patient outcomes and detail our surgical approach when resecting these tumors with a smaller, less invasive "mini-pterional" craniotomy.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review on all patients undergoing a mini-pterional craniotomy for resection of parasellar meningiomas from 2012 to 2016. We describe the technical aspects of the mini-pterional craniotomy and provide the outcomes of patients who received an operation with this approach.
   RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were treated with a mini-pterional craniotomy for resection of parasellar meningiomas. Median tumor volume was 6.2 cm(3). Twenty-two of 24 (92%) patients had a World Health Organization grade I meningioma, and 2 of 24 (8%) patients had a World Health Organization grade II meningioma. Tumors were located at the medial sphenoid wing (60%), anterior clinoid (24%) and spheno-cavernous junction (12%). Nineteen of 24 (79%) patients had a Simpson Grade I resection and 5 of 24 (21%) a Simpson Grade IV resection. Median length of the operations was 242 minutes. Neurosurgical complications occurred in 2 patients who had a surgical-site infection and cerebrospinal fluid leak; one of these patients also developed postoperative hydrocephalus. In this series, no deaths, parenchymal contusions, or repeat operations occurred.
   CONCLUSIONS: The mini-pterional craniotomy can be used to resect parasellar meningiomas with good results and a low complication profile. This approach provides an efficacious method of resecting these tumors without sacrificing Simpson grade or patient safety.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer need high-quality information about disease stage, treatment options, and side effects. High-quality information can also improve health literacy, shared decision making, and satisfaction. We created patient-specific three-dimensional (3D) models of tumors including surrounding functional areas and assessed what patients with glioma value (or fear) about the models when they are used to educate them about the relationship between their tumor and specific brain parts, the surgical procedure, and risks.
   METHODS: This exploratory study included adult patients with glioma who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging as part of preoperative work-up. All participants received an actual-size 3D model printed based on functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to identify facilitators and barriers for using the model and perceived effects.
   RESULTS: Models were successfully created for all 11 participants. There were 18 facilitators and 8 barriers identified. The model improved patients' understanding about their situation; patients reported that it was easier to ask their neurosurgeon questions based on their model and that it supported their decision about preferred treatment. A perceived barrier for using the 3D model was that it could be emotionally confronting, particularly in an early phase of the disease. Positive effects were related to psychological domains, including coping, learning effects, and communication.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patient-specific 3D models are promising and simple tools that could help patients with glioma better understand their situation, treatment options, and risks. These models have the potential to improve shared decision making.

AB BACKGROUND: There is a growing interest to include evaluations of cognitive performance in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma (GBM). However, as changes in cognitive performance of a group may mask changes in individual patients, study results are often difficult to transfer into clinical practice. We focused on the comparison of group versus individual changes in neuropsychological performance of patients with GBM after initial surgical treatment. -
   METHODS: Patients underwent neuropsychological evaluation using CNS Vital Signs 1 day prior to and 3 months after surgery. Two-tailed paired-samples t tests were conducted to assess changes on the group level. Reliable change indices (RCIs) that correct for practice effects and imperfect test-retest reliabilities were used to examine changes in individual patients.
   RESULTS: Cognitive dysfunction was common (>80%) both before and 3 months after surgery in this sample of 82 patients with GBM. Whereas group analyses revealed minimal changes in performance over time, RCIs demonstrated that most patients (89%) showed changes in performance in at least 1 cognitive domain. Half of these individual patients solely showed improvements, a quarter solely showed declines, and another quarter showed both improvements and declines.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study clearly demonstrates that important individual changes in performance are masked when looking only at group results. Future studies should more often use an individual patient approach to enhance knowledge transfer into clinical practice.

AB OBJECTIVE: Segmental instability traditionally is investigated with flexion and extension (F/E) radiographs. We sought to determine whether motion between upright and supine (U/S) views can serve as an alternative sensitive diagnostic tool that predicts similar outcomes.
   METHODS: Ambispective collection of data was performed for 222 consecutive patients who underwent transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. Patients were divided into either group 1 (>= 3 mm spondylolisthesis difference between F/E radiographs) or group 2 (>= 3 mm spondylolisthesis difference between U/S imaging and otherwise not meeting group 1 criteria).
   RESULTS: In total, 77 patients met all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients in group 1 (n = 26) and group 2 (n = 51) did not differ with respect to key demographic criteria. Average clinical follow-up for groups 1 and 2 were 31.8 and 35.6 months (P = 0.43). Average spondylolisthesis was 8.1 mm and 8.0 mm for groups 1 and 2 (P = 0.93). The incidence of facet joint hyperintensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and average maximal facet joint widening (P > 0.2) did not differ between groups. Average F/E slip change was 5.0 mm for group 1 and average U/S slip change was 5.2 mm for group 2. For both groups, Numeric Rating Scale Back Pain and Numeric Rating Scale Leg Pain, Oswestry Disability Index v2.1a, and Short-Form 36 RAND (P < 0.02) improved significantly after surgery. Furthermore, Delta Numeric Rating Scale Back Pain, DNumeric Rating Scale Leg Pain, Delta Oswestry Disability Index v2.1a, and Delta Short-Form 36 RAND (P > 0.2) were not significantly different between groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: No differences in outcomes were noted between patients based on either imaging criteria. These data suggest that static U/S imaging may identify a distinct group of patients who may benefit from transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion surgery .

AB BACKGROUND: The invasion and recurrence of clinical nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFA) often lead to surgical treatment failure. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of RNAs whose 30 and 50 ends are joined together and have been shown to play important roles in cancer development. Until now, the roles of circRNAs have remained unclear in invasive and recurrent NFA.
   METHODS: We detected and summarized the circRNA expression pattern in 75 NFA tissues from 10 noninvasive cases and 65 invasive cases and 9 pairs of NFA tumor tissues from 9 recurrent cases by circRNA microarrays. Accordingly, functional enrichment analysis and pathway analysis were performed and the circRNA-microRNA (miRNA) network was generated by bioinformatic analysis tools. Five new invasive NFA samples and 5 noninvasive NFA samples were collected to measure the microarray results.
   RESULTS: A total of 570 dysregulated circRNAs (invasive tumor vs. noninvasive tumor) and 10 upregulated circRNAs (recurrent tumor tissue vs. first surgery tumor tissue) were identified based on the situation (fold change >2; P < 0.05). The parental genes of the dysregulated circRNAs in the comparison between invasion tumor and noninvasion tumor were found to be enriched in some cell adhesion signaling pathways such as Focal adhesion, Hippo signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and Adherens junction. The circRNA-miRNA network showed that the dysregulated circRNA may function as miRNA sponges.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to conduct and comprehensively analyze the circRNA expression profile in invasive and recurrent NFA. Our finding will provide evidence for the significance of circRNAs in NFA diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical treatment.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the importance and types of peritumoral draining veins in parasagittal and falcine meningiomas and administer corresponding protective strategies during surgery according to these different types to improve tumor resection rate and maximize the protection of neurologic functions.
   METHODS: The clinical information of 156 patients with parasagittal and falcine meningiomas who were admitted at the Neurosurgery Department of our hospital was collected and retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent pathologic classification, magnetic resonance imaging scanning and enhancement, and magnetic resonance venography examinations.
   RESULTS: Among these patients, 113 (72.4%) had Simpson grade I and II resection, whereas 43 patients (27.6%) had Simpson grade III and IV resection and underwent postoperative adjuvant gamma knife surgery. Karnofsky Performance Status evaluation was carried out at 1 week after surgery. In total, 69 patients (44.3%) improved, 66 patients (42.3%) had no changes, and 21 patients (13.4%) had worsened conditions (7 patients had hemiplegia, 5 patients had aphasia, 4 patients had decreased vision, and 5 patients had ataxia). There were no deaths. According to the 2016 World Health Organization pathologic grading, 131 patients (84%) were grade I, 22 patients (14%) were grade II, and 3 patients were grade III (2%). Furthermore, 105 patients were followed up for 1-4 years. There were 11 cases of recurrence.
   CONCLUSIONS: The classification and evaluation of peritumoral draining veins through preoperative-combined magnetic resonance venography can be used as a guide in determining the corresponding protective strategy during surgery. This can significantly improve the tumor resection rate and decrease the postoperative disability rate.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical impact of extubation failure (EF) in patients with good-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), in whom a good clinical course usually is expected.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the clinical data from 141 patients with SAH and 1) initial Hunt & Hess grade 1-3; 2) induction of general anesthesia for intervention; and 3) the presence of data about the functional outcome. Patients were divided into 3 groups: 1) primary tracheotomized patients (PT); 2) patients with successful extubation (ES); and 3) patients with EF (reintubation within 48 hours).
   RESULTS: EF occurred with a rate of 0.12. The leading cause of EF was respiratory insufficiency (n = 7), followed by impaired consciousness (n = 5). Multivariate logistic regression did not show any neurologic predictor of EF. Patients with ES showed an excellent outcome after 6 months (favorable outcome: 95.7%), whereas the outcome of patients with EF and PT was significantly (P < 0.05) poorer. The case fatality rate was nonsignificantly greater in the EF group (0.15 vs. 0.03). Hospitalization was significantly reduced for patients with ES, whereas the occurrence of symptomatic cerebral vasospasms and vasospastic cerebral infarction was similar between patients with EF, ES, or PT.
   CONCLUSIONS: We showed that EF is a frequent condition in good grade-SAH but is not predictable using common neurologic parameters. Regarding the functional outcome, we were able to show that the result of an extubation trial clearly delineates the patients in 2 distinct groups, in which ES predicts an excellent outcome.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite aggressive multimodal treatment, survival for patients with glioblastoma remains dismal. One obstacle to improving patient outcomes is the difficulty in delivering adequate therapeutic to the central nervous system due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier. Although direct drug infusion by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) can bypass the blood-brain barrier and facilitate delivery to intracranial tumors, determining the distribution of delivered therapeutic remains problematic. Image guidance is a strategy that can optimize the accuracy of therapeutic delivery.
   METHODS: Here we performed an open-label clinical trial in 10 pet dogs with spontaneous intracranial tumors to examine the target coverage accuracy of delivering polymeric magnetite nanoparticles (PMNPs) encapsulating temozolomide (TMZ). A modified small animal frame was applied to the head of each subject, and PMNPs were delivered stereotactically to the center of the tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed immediately postoperatively to examine PMNP distribution, and the animals were followed until death.
   RESULTS: Nine of the 10 dogs underwent PMNP infusion without complications. No infusate backflow was observed during any procedure. In 70% of the cases, the infusion accurately targeted the tumor mass, as determined by the presence of PMNP signal in the tumor on immediate postoperative MRI.
   CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that CED of PMNPs carrying TMZ is safe in dogs with intracranial tumors and can lead to nanoparticle distribution in the region of the target. Image guidance is an important adjunct to CED, because distribution is unpredictable, with the potential for missed target delivery.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the utility of mechanomyography (MMG) in detecting and preventing pedicle breach in instrumented lumbar spine surgery.
   METHODS: In a prospective nonrandomized trial without controls, we selected consecutive patients to undergo intraoperative MMG during instrumented lumbar spine surgery. MMG testing was performed at the original pilot hole, after tapping, and after screw placement, with the minimum current to elicit a recorded MMG response. All patients underwent a postoperative computed tomography scan, and a single radiologist interpreted each pedicle to identify breach. Chi-square test was used to compare patients with and without breaches. Two sample Student's ttests were used to compare changes in functional outcomes. Sensitivity and specificity of MMG were computed using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.
   RESULTS: There were 122 consecutive instrumented lumbar surgery patients enrolled, with a total of 890 lumbar pedicle screws tested with MMG. The medial or inferior breach rate was 2.25%, with no statistically significant difference in Oswestry Disability Index or visual analog scale between patients who breached and who did not. For the MMG measurement from the original pilot hole, the area under the receiver operating characteristic was 0.835; the maximum combination of sensitivity (80.42%) and specificity (80.6%) was found using MMG current <= 12 mA. We found that an MMG cutoff of >12 mA resulted in a 99.5% likelihood of no medial or inferior breach.
   CONCLUSIONS: MMG can be safely used during instrumented lumbar spine surgery. A cutoff value of >12 mA for MMG can accurately predict and prevent medial and inferior pedicle screw breach.

AB OBJECTIVE: Chordoid meningioma (CM) and clear-cell meningioma (CCM) are rare World Health Organization grade II meningioma subtypes. This study aimed to evaluate favorable factors and appropriate therapeutic strategies for these lesions.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical data from 111 cases of grade II meningiomas, including 55 cases of CM and 56 cases of CCM, between January 2011 and December 2015.
   RESULTS: The mean follow-up time of the rare World Health Organization grade II meningiomas (n = 111) was 45.3 months. In the CM group, 8 patients (14.5%) experienced recurrence, and 2 patients (3.6%) died. In the CCM group, 22 patients (39.3%) experienced recurrence, and 9 patients (16.1%) died. Significant differences were observed between the CM and CCM groups in tumor size (P = 0.019), history of surgery (P = 0.038), and peritumoral edema (P = 0.004). In the CM group, gross total resection was associated with favorable progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.144; 95% confidence interval, 0.029-0.714; P = 0.018). In the CCM group, univariate analyses showed that preoperative Karnofsky Performance Status <80 (P<0.001), tumor size >= 5 cm (P = 0.015), tumor size (per-centimeter increase) (P = 0.022), bone invasion (P = 0.004), a history of surgery (P < 0.001), and subtotal resection (P = 0.009) were associated with worse progression-free survival. Male gender (P = 0.039), tumor size (per-centimeter increase) (P = 0.043), bone invasion (P = 0.030), and a history of surgery (P = 0.007) were associated with poor overall survival.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that gross total resection should be achieved in grade II meningiomas. Patients with larger tumors and/or surgical histories had worse outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) as a form of indirect revascularization has been recently proposed as a potentially promising alternative for patients with intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD). The object of this study was to compare the prognostic roles between isolated EDAS and medical therapy in patients with atherosclerotic middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).
   METHODS: From January 2014 to June 2017, 125 patients with atherosclerotic MCAO were enrolled in this prospective nonrandomized controlled cohort study. Patients who underwent EDAS (n = 60) were compared with those treated medically (n = 65). Early and late adverse events and functional outcomes including memory ability were compared between groups.
   RESULTS: During 23.7 months of mean follow-up, rates of adverse events, including ischemic events in the territory of the qualifying middle cerebral artery, and death from any causes, were not significantly different in patients treated with EDAS and with medical therapy (6.7% vs. 12.3%; P = 0.285). Landmark analyses showed that at initial 6-month follow-up, there was no significant difference for adverse event rates, whereas the opposite finding was shown for the subsequent period (EDAS 1/57 [1.7%] vs. medical management 7/64 [10.9%]; P = 0.024). The P value for the interaction between time (first 6 months vs. subsequent period) was 0.044. No significant differences were found with respect to neural function status and cognitive ability.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the long-term, isolated EDAS can be considered effective and safe for patients with atherosclerotic MCAO, whereas it may need additional medical therapy support in the short-term.

AB OBJECTIVE: Vestibular schwannomas (VSs) can cause serious neurological defects including hearing loss and facial paralysis. The aim of this study is to identify whether Hippo signaling could be a potential targetable pathway for clinical treatment in VSs.
   METHODS: Gene expression profiling was performed in 10 sporadic VSs and 4 normal nerves to identify aberrant genes expression of the Hippo pathway. Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining were used to examine the expression of Hippo core components in 20 VS samples. Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene sequencing was also performed in all tumors using sanger sequencing. Verteporfin, inhibitor of yes-associated protein (YAP)-TEA domain family member, was used to assess the effect of proliferation inhibition in human primary VS cells and RT4-D6P2T cell line.
   RESULTS: We found 51 differentially expressed genes of the Hippo pathway between VSs and healthy controls. Unsupervised analysis identified the 2 molecular variants that significantly related with distinct NF2 mutation status. The phosphorylation levels of large tumor suppressor 1 and YAP were significantly decreased in NF2-mutated VSs compared with wild-type VSs and normal nerves. Immunohistochemical staining showed that increased nuclear YAP expression in VSs was positively correlated with high Ki-67 index and low Merlin expression. Verteporfin reduced viability of primary VS cells and RT4-D6P2T cells.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings implicate that deregulation of the Hippo pathway as a molecular mechanism of pathogenesis in human VSs, and suggest inhibition of this pathway as a potential treatment strategy.

AB OBJECTIVE: Hematoma expansion (HE) is closely related to poor outcome in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH). Island sign (IS) is a novel HE predictor based on non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT). This study is aimed to confirm the accuracy of IS for predicting HE and compare it to the spot sign (SS) on computed tomography angiography (CTA).
   METHODS: Patients with sICH and initial CTA within 6 hours after onset and follow-up NCCT within 24 hours after initial CTA were included. IS and SS were screened by 2 independent readers. The sensitivity and specificity were evaluated for both signs. Receiver-operator analysis was conducted to assess the accuracy of both signs for predicting HE.
   RESULTS: This study included 165 patients. IS was found in 33 (20.0%) patients, and SS was identified in 42 (25.5%) patients. In the 41 patients with HE, 19 (46.3%) had IS and 26 (63.4%) had SS. The sensitivity and specificity of IS were 46.3% and 88.7%, respectively. In contrast, the sensitivity and specificity of SS were 63.4% and 87.1%, respectively. The areas under the curve of IS and SS were 0.675 and 0.753, respectively (P = 0.275).
   CONCLUSIONS: IS is independently associated with HE. Although the accuracy of IS for predicting HE is lower than SS, it can be an alternative predictor if CTA cannot be performed.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the impact of single-level transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) on lumbar sagittal profile in degenerative spondylosis (DS) patients with or without kyphotic alignment, as well as compare radiologic and clinical outcomes based on pre-operative sagittal alignment.
   BACKGROUND: DS with a kyphotic alignment at an involved segment constitutes a distinct subgroup. However, previous studies concerning surgical outcomes often lump all patients together without focusing on this distinct subgroup.
   METHODS: This study reviewed a consecutive series of patients who received single-level TLIF for DS between 2009 and 2016. They were assigned to Groups K and L. All patients were followed up for >2 years. Then demographics and radiographic and clinical outcomes were compared between the groups.
   RESULTS: There were 19 and 115 patients in Group K and Group L, respectively. Compared with Group L, Group K was characterized by loss of lumbar lordosis and anterior shifting of L1 axis S1 distance. After surgery, lumbar lordosis and L1 axis S1 distance was significantly improved in Group K, while no significant change occurred in group L. The mean reduction rate was significantly higher in Group K, which had less slippage after surgery, but the differences in slip angle, anterior disk height, and posterior disk height were not significant. The preoperative Oswestry Disability Index and visual analog scale for back pain scores were significantly higher in Group K, while no differences were found in postoperative evaluation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite effective changes radiographic parameters and clinical outcomes, our findings suggest that the 2 groups behave differently in response to single-level TLIF procedure. Reconstruction of lumbar sagittal profile can be achieved in DS with a kyphotic alignment after surgery.

AB Microwave co-pyrolysis (MCP) of waste cooking oil (WCO) and waste polyolefins (WP) was examined for its potential to convert these wastes into liquid fuel. The influence of performing the pyrolysis process under N-2 atmosphere and vacuum environment was investigated with emphasis on the temperature profile, heating rate, and the yield and properties of the liquid oil obtained. Different ratios of WP to WCO (1:2, 1:1.5, 1:1, 1.5:1, and 2:1) were also investigated. MCP performed under vacuum environment recorded higher heating rates (20-24 C/min) and higher yield of liquid oil (up to 62 wt.%) compared to that performed under N-2 atmosphere (18-22 C/min of heating rate and 24-50 wt.% of liquid oil). The high heating rate resulted in shorter reaction time and lower power consumption, leading to lower energy consumption by the pyrolysis process. The liquid oil comprised C-13-C-24 hydrocarbons (aliphatics, aromatics) within the hydrocarbon range of diesel fuel. It also showed promising green properties comprising low nitrogen and oxygen content, and free of sulphur. Combined with the detection of high energy content (42-49 MJ/kg) and low moisture content (< 1 wt.%), the liquid oil shows great potential to be used as a fuel. Our results show that MCP performed under vacuum environment shows potential as a promising pyrolysis approach with improved heating performance and production of hydrocarbon fuel with desirable fuel properties.

AB The size and speed of release of proteins of different sizes from standard cellulose sulphate capsules (Cell-in-aBox (R)) was investigated. Proteins with molecular weights of up to around 70kD can be released. The conformation, charge and concentration of the protein being released play a role in the release kinetics. Small proteins such as cytokines can be easily released. The ability to produce cytokines at a sustained and predefined level from encapsulated cells genetically engineered to overexpress such cytokines and implanted into patients may aid immunotherapies of cancer as well as infectious and other diseases. It will also allow allogeneic rather than autologous cells to be used. We show that cells encapsulated in polymers of cellulose sulphate are able to release cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) in a stimulated fashion e.g. using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) plus ionomycin. Given the excellent documented safety record of cellulose sulphate in patients, these data suggest that clinical usage of the technology may be warranted for cancer treatment and other diseases.

AB A new class of non-spherical particles was recently designed in our research group by mixing a polysaccharide grafted with fatty acids and alpha-cyclodextrin in water. Because their flat surfaces, and according to their size, particles are called micro-or nano-platelets. Here, we varied the composition of fatty acids grafted on chitosan (oleic acid, palmitic acid or stearic acid) and characterized platelet morphology. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), cryogenic TEM, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy experiments showed that the platelets have a preferentially hexagonal shape with sharp edges, independently on alkyl chain grafted on chitosan. Furthermore, AFM topographic analysis of platelet surface showed parallel thin terraces with 12-14-nm height, suggesting a multi-layered structure alternating chitosan and fatty-acid/alpha-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes. We also revealed for the first time that a simple magnetic mixing of fatty acids with alpha-cyclodextrin in water results from solid inclusion complexes with a crystalline structural organization characterized by powder X-ray diffraction. Our results demonstrate that fatty acid/alpha-cyclodextrin interaction is the driving force for platelet formation.

AB Despite the high quantities of tablets produced daily, many tableting processes are still operated at sub-optimal settings and hence lack the necessary flexibility to mitigate for possible process deviations. However, to ensure this flexibility on tableting throughput it is important to select the most robust feed frame design and settings regarding die-filling. In this research study, four paddle designs for a two-compartment forced feeder (equipped with a metering and a feeding paddle wheel) were evaluated at a wide range of process-settings (i.e. tableting speed, paddle speed, overfill level) and feed frame features (i.e. deaeration) for their impact on the die-filling step of a poorly flowing model formulation (i.e. MCC 101) using a quality-by-design approach. No benefit on diefilling was observed when using higher speeds of the metering paddle wheel compared to the feeding paddle wheel, and no convincing arguments were obtained to use the feed frame deaeration opening. Some combinations of paddle design and process-settings significantly increased the risk for inconsistent die-filling (i.e. high tablet weight variability) which can therefore limit the efficiency of the tableting process. The approach used in this study enabled to compare the paddle designs for their die-filling performance in function of varying tableting speeds, eventually resulting in the selection of a feed frame design that is most robust and therefore will provide a uniform die-filling over a wide range of throughputs. Selection of the most robust parameters is an important prerequisite for the ability of using the rotary tablet press as an agile unit-operation.

AB Oxidative stress has been implicated in the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Treatment with antioxidants seems to delay progression of AMD. In this study, we suggested an antioxidant delivery system based on redox-sensitive liposome composed of phospholipids and a diselenide centered alkyl chain. Dynamic light scattering assessment indicated that the liposomes had an average size of 140 nm with a polydispersity index below 0.2. The percentage of encapsulation efficiency of the liposomes was calculated by high-performance liquid chromatography. The carriers were loaded with N-acetyl cysteine as a model antioxidant drug. We demonstrated responsiveness of the nanocarrier and its efficiency in drug delivery in an oxidative stress model of human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial (hESC-RPE) cells. The modeled cells treated with diselenide containing liposomes loaded with 10mM NAC, showed a better therapeutic effect with a cell metabolic activity of 90%, which was significantly higher compared to insensitive liposomes or NAC treated groups (P < 0.05). In addition, the expression of oxidative-sensitive gene markers in diselenide containing liposomes groups were improved. Our results demonstrated fabricated smart liposomes opens new opportunity for targeted treatment of retinal degeneration.

AB D-beta-hydroxybutyrate and melatonin (BHB/MLT) infusion improves survival in hemorrhagic shock models. The original BHB/MLT formulation contains dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to increase melatonin solubility. We formulated BHB/MLT solutions wherein DMSO was replaced either with 10% polyvinylpyrrolidone (BHB/MLT/PVP) or with 5% hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin/2.5% PVP/2.5% polyethylene glycol 400 (BHB/MLT/CD). Safety and efficacy of the new and the original BHB/MLT solution were tested in a lethal rat hemorrhagic shock model, with seven groups: 1) sham, 2) shock, untreated, 3) shock, lactated Ringer's solution (LR), 4) shock, 4M BHB/MLT/DMSO, 5) shock, 2M BHB/MLT/DMSO, 6) shock, BHB/MLT/PVP and 7) shock, BHB/MLT/CD. BHB/MLT/DMSO was given at full strength and 1:1 dilution to match the concentration of the novel formulations. Rats were anesthetized, instrumented, and 40% of the total blood volume was withdrawn in three steps, followed by four-hour long shock. Treatment boluses were infused half-way throughout hemorrhage. Survival was highest in BHB/MLT/CD-treated rats (8/10), followed by the BHB/MLT/PVP (6/10), 4M BHB/MLT/DMSO (5/10) or 2M BHB/MLT/DMSO (5/10), LR (3/10) and the untreated group (0/11). Survival did not differ significantly between BHB/MLT groups (p>0.05), but was significantly higher in BHB/MLT/CD than in LR-treated animals (p=0.018). BHB/MLT/PVP and BHB/MLT/CD constitute promising candidates for clinical hemorrhagic shock treatment.

AB Drug release from a new type of matrix material consisting of partially fibrillated microcrystalline cellulose was investigated. A mechanical treatment of novel AaltoCell T cellulose microcrystals caused partial opening of the nanofibrillary structure of the cellulose particles and entanglement of individual particles led into formation of an elastic network of microcrystalline cellulose. The rheological properties of the stable hydrogel-like materials were characterised by shear rheometry. Model compounds metronidazole and lysozyme were successfully employed in drug release experiments carried out by delignified (bleached) and lignin-containing matrices. The viscosity as well as the lignin-content played a role in the release dynamics of the drugs. Microcrystalline AaltoCell T was proven as high-performing material for diffusion controlled release of the chosen model compounds and can be seen as a safe and economical alternative for novel matrix materials such as nanocellulose or cellulose derivatives.

AB Over the past decade, formulation predictive dissolution (fPD) testing has gained increasing attention. Another mindset is pushed forward where scientists in our field are more confident to explore the in vivo behavior of an oral drug product by performing predictive in vitro dissolution studies. Similarly, there is an increasing interest in the application of modern computational fluid dynamics (CFD) frameworks and high-performance computing platforms to study the local processes underlying absorption within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In that way, CFD and computing platforms both can inform future PBPK-based in silico frameworks and determine the GI-motility-driven hydrodynamic impacts that should be incorporated into in vitro dissolution methods for in vivo relevance. Current compendial dissolution methods are not always reliable to predict the in vivo behavior, especially not for biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS) class 2/4 compounds suffering from a low aqueous solubility. Developing a predictive dissolution test will be more reliable, cost-effective and less time-consuming as long as the predictive power of the test is sufficiently strong. There is a need to develop a biorelevant, predictive dissolution method that can be applied by pharmaceutical drug companies to facilitate marketing access for generic and novel drug products. In 2014, Prof. Gordon L. Amidon and his team initiated a far-ranging research program designed to integrate (1) in vivo studies in humans in order to further improve the understanding of the intraluminal processing of oral dosage forms and dissolved drug along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, (2) advancement of in vitro methodologies that incorporates higher levels of in vivo relevance and (3) computational experiments to study the local processes underlying dissolution, transport and absorption within the intestines performed with a new unique CFD based framework. Of particular importance is revealing the physiological variables determining the variability in in vivo dissolution and GI absorption from person to person in order to address (potential) in vivo BE failures. This paper provides an introduction to this multidisciplinary project, informs the reader about current achievements and outlines future directions.

AB A new shadowgraphic imaging method and an associated instrument for analyzing the physical stability of pharmaceutical suspensions are introduced in this paper. The new suspension tester consists mainly of a high-resolution camera that takes sequential shadowgraphic images of emulsions or suspensions and a 2D collimated LED for simultaneous whole-sample illumination in bright field. A built-in ultrasonic bath provides controlled initial agitation to the samples of interest. Sequential images acquired by the experimental setup were used to derive normalized transmission profiles from which an instability index was developed for quantitative stability comparison between samples. Instrument performance was verified by measuring the stability of a series of oilin-water emulsions prepared with surfactant mixtures of different ratios. The new instrument correctly determined the required hydrophilic-lipophilic balance for sunflower oil to be 7.0. The stability of a pressurized suspension of spray dried lipid (DSPC) particles was monitored for 5 days after propellant filling. Although stable for the first 24 h, the lipid suspension was found to decrease in stability from day 1 to day 4. Morphological and spectroscopic analysis revealed that the suspended DSPC particles had reformed into large thin sheets of lipid, thereby causing the gradual stability decrease during the aging study. The effects of initial agitation on the stability of suspensions were demonstrated by agitating a suspension of micronized fluticasone propionate in propellant using a wrist action shaker and an ultrasonic bath respectively. A significant improvement of suspension stability was achieved by replacing the wrist action shaker method with ultrasonic agitation. Simultaneous illumination of the complete suspension, a high image acquisition rate, and controlled initial agitation are features that make this new suspension tester a suitable and more reliable instrument for investigating the stability of pressurized pharmaceutical suspensions.

AB Currently, bacterial conjunctivitis is treated by frequent administration of antibiotic eye drop solutions, which is tedious and patient noncompliant. Contact lenses could be ideal medical devices to sustain the release of ophthalmic drugs, but the incorporation of the latter can alter the optical and physical properties of the lenses. In addition, many contact lens users have reported the pink eye syndrome, making them unsuitable as ocular medical devices. In the present study, we have designed a novel type of lenses containing semi-circular rings loaded with moxifloxacin HCl (a broad spectrum antibiotic) and hyaluronic acid (a comfort agent), respectively, in order to treat bacterial conjunctivitis without altering the critical lens properties. The drug loaded rings were implanted separately within the periphery of the contact lenses using the modified cast moulding technology. The atomic force microscopy report showed an average roughness of 22.27 nm for the implant lens, which was significantly lower in comparison to the marketed Freshlook (R) (116.27 nm) contact lens. The major amount of moxifloxacin HCl was leached (68.16-74.55%) during the monomer extraction and wet sterilization (autoclave) steps; hence the lenses were terminally sterilized by radiation and packaged under dry condition (dehydrated). The in vitro release data showed release for moxifloxacin HCl and hyaluronic acid up to 96 h. The in vivo drug release studies showed significant improvement [> MIC for Staphylococcus aureus] in the drug residence time in comparison to the eye drop therapy. The in vivo efficacy study in the staphylococcus aureus induced conjunctivitis showed equivalent healing effect with the single implant contact lens in comparison to the frequent high dose eye drop therapy. The study demonstrated the successful application of the implantation technology to codeliver moxifloxacin HCl and hyaluronic acid from the contact lenses for the extended period of time to treat conjunctivitis.

AB Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is caused by the lysosomal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) due to the deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA). Currently available treatments may improve several clinical manifestations, but they have limited effects on joint disease, resulting in persistent orthopedic complications and impaired mobility. Thus, this study aimed to perform an intra-articular administration of cationic nanoemulsions complexed with the plasmid encoding for the IDUA protein (pIDUA) targeting MPS I gene therapy for the synovial joints. Formulations composed of DOPE, DOTAP, MCT (NE), and DSPE-PEG (NEPEG) were prepared by high-pressure homogenization, and the pIDUA plasmid was associated by adsorption onto the surface of nanoemulsions (pIDUA/NE or pIDUA/NE-PEG). The physicochemical characterization showed that the presence of DSPE-PEG in pIDUA/NE-PEG formulations led to small and highly stable droplets even when incubated with simulated synovial fluid (SSF), when compared to the non-pegylated complexes (pIDUA/NE). Uptake by fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) was demonstrated, and high cell viability (70%) in addition with increased IDUA activity (2.5% of normal) were observed after incubation with pIDUA/NE-PEG. The intra-articular injection of pIDUA/NE-PEG complexes in MPS I mice showed that the complexes were localized in the joints, were able to transfect synovial cells, and thus promoted an increase in IDUA activity and expression in the synovial fluid, with no significant activity in other tissues (kidney, liver, lung, and spleen). The overall results demonstrated a contained, safe, tolerable, and effective in situ approach of nonviral intra-articular gene therapy targeting the reduction or prevention of the debilitating orthopedic complications of MPS I disorder.

AB Risperidone is applied in oral dosage formulations in the treatment of mental diseases. Current trends point toward parenteral delivery systems based on poly(lactide-co-glycolide), with wafers or rods being the more attractive option than the routinely used intramuscular suspension with microparticles. The aim of our work was to study the utility of solution casting and hot melt extrusion in the formulation of wafers and rods with risperidone based on terpolymers, namely poly(lactide-co-glycolide-co-trimethylene carbonate) and poly(lactideco- glycolide-co-e-caprolactone). Synthesis of the terpolymers was carried out by using a non-toxic zirconium initiator and a racemic (LL/DD) or optically active form of the lactide monomer. The delivery systems were analyzed by NMR, DSC, GPC, and SEM. The release profile was monitored by HPLC. Terpolymer chain microstructure, glass transition temperature, and morphology revealed unchanged values after formulation. Solution casting resulted in a drop in molecular weight to a smaller degree than hot melt extrusion. The presence of risperidone influenced another decrease in molecular weight. Both methods are adequate for the formulation of delivery systems based on terpolymers for prolonged release of risperidone. An adequate selection of monomer composition in terpolymers allows to control the release period. Risperidone was released in three phases, however, the burst effect was observed for poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide-co-e-caprolactone).

AB A requirement of gene therapy is efficient nucleic acid delivery. However, the application of cationic liposomes to gene therapy is restricted by their inefficient transfection capacity, which may be caused by cytotoxicity. This cytotoxicity is highly dependent on cationic lipid-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, to provide cellular protection, we used edaravone, an efficacious anti-oxidative drug, to scavenge ROS during transfection using cationic liposome/plasmid DNA complexes (lipoplexes). Both free edaravone and edaravone-loaded liposomes (EDLPs) enhanced transgene expression in the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, while EDLPs decreased the effective dose of edaravone. The cellular protective effect of edaravone was found to decrease the cytotoxicity of cationic liposomes. Edaravone was also effective in the commercial product, Lipofectamine (R) 3000, which may expand the application of edaravone to promote transfection efficiency. Compared with free edaravone, EDLPs also showed superior transgene expression in mice. Our findings will promote the development of efficient and safe gene therapy.

AB The purpose of this work was to study a new dry powder inhaler (DPI) of tobramycin capable to simplify the dose administration maneuvers to maximize the cystic fibrosis (CF) patient care in antibiotic inhalation therapy.
   For the purpose, tobramycin/sodium stearate powder (TobraPS) having a high drug content, was produced by spray drying, characterized and the aerodynamic behavior was investigated in vitro using different RS01 DPI inhalers. The aerosols produced with 28, 56 or 112 mg of tobramycin in TobraPS powder using capsules size #3, # 2 or # 0 showed that there was quasi linear relationship between the amount loaded in the device and the FPD.
   An in vivo study in healthy human volunteers showed that 3-6 inhalation acts were requested by the volunteers to inhale 120 mg of TobraPS powder loaded in a size #0 capsule aerosolized with a prototype RS01 device, according to their capability to inhale. The amount of powder emitted at 4 kPa pressure drop at constant air flow well correlated with the in vivo emission at dynamic flow, when the same volume of air passed through the device.
   The novel approach for the administration of 112 mg of tobramycin in one capsule could improve the convenience and adherence of the CF patient to the antibiotic therapy.

AB The low-temperature storage of therapeutic cell-based products plays a crucial role in their clinical translation for the treatment of diverse diseases. Although dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO) is the most successful cryoprotectant in slow freezing of microencapsulated cells, it has shown adverse effects after cryopreserved cell-based products implantation. Therefore, the search of alternative non-toxic cryoprotectants for encapsulated cells is continuously investigated to move from bench to the clinic. In this work, we investigated the low molecular-weight hyaluronan (low MW-HA), a natural non-toxic and non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan, as an alternative non-permeant cryoprotectant for the slow freezing cryopreservation of encapsulated cells. Cryopreservation with low MW-HA provided similar metabolic activity, cell dead and early apoptotic cell percentage and membrane integrity after thawing, than encapsulated cells stored with either DMSO 10% or Cryostor 10. However, the beneficial outcomes with low MW-HA were not comparable to DMSO with some encapsulated cell types, such as the human insulin secreting cell line, 1.1B4, maybe explained by the different expression of the CD44 surface receptor. Altogether, we can conclude that low MW-HA represents a non-toxic natural alternative cryoprotectant to DMSO for the cryopreservation of encapsulated cells.

AB Micro- and nano-platelets are a group of particles with typical flat surfaces and hexagonal shape. They are obtained by hierarchical self-assembly in water of alpha-cyclodextrin and polysaccharides hydrophobically-modified with alkyl chains. It is expected that the formation of well structured and cohesive platelets is driven by the interaction between alkyl chains grafted on polysaccharides and alpha-cyclodextrin. The objective of this investigation is to tune platelet formation by modifying these two parameters, independently on polysaccharide composition. A systematic study was conducted by varying polysaccharide type (dextran, pullulan, amylopectin), degree of substitution (DS: 0.1-5.6%) and alpha-cyclodextrin concentration (0-10 wt%) for a fixed concentration of polysaccharide esterified with palmitoyl groups (1 wt%). Characterizations include ATR-FTIR, elemental analysis, solid state C-13 NMR and transmission electron microscopy. Abundant and well-organized hexagonal platelets were obtained with high DS (4.2-5.6%) and a concentration of alpha-cyclodextrin higher than 2.5 wt%. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed a sequential binding with a stoichiometry of 2 alpha-cyclodextrin molecules for 1 palmitoyl group grafted on dextran. This is the first report showing the possibility to control platelet formation by modifying DS and alpha-cyclodextrin concentration, independently on polysaccharide composition.

   Nanoparticles; Highly resistive dusts
ID NANOPARTICLES
AB The low bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs is currently one of the major focuses of pharmaceutical research. One strategy currently being investigated to overcome this limitation is to decrease the particle size of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). An innovative process for this is spray drying with spray conditioning, which can produce submicron particles. One challenge resulting from this process is the recovery of these dispersed particles from a gas flow. Electrostatic precipitation is a common technique for air purification purposes, but an adapted electrostatic precipitator (ESP) design is necessary to achieve high collection efficiencies. The ESP design in this work uses the precipitation method of Penney filters which separates charging and collection into two stages.
   The ESP dimensions depend on various assumptions and simplifications. Several experiments were conducted to assess the performance of the ESP and characterize its behaviour in long-term tests. The crucial parameters in the charging process are the residence time as well as the operating voltage. These constraints were examined to enhance the collection efficiency. Based on these tests it was possible to determine a suitable charging length as well as the dimensions of the collection stage.
   In conclusion, an ESP customized for collecting particles in the range of 0.1-1 mu m was designed, built and tested, and collection efficiencies higher than 99% were achieved for submicron particle size distributions. For a robust process continuous cleaning of the charging stage is necessary.

AB Drug delivery via the inhaled route has advantages for treating local and systemic diseases. Pulmonary drug delivery may have potential in treating tuberculosis (TB), which is mainly localised in the lung (pulmonary tuberculosis similar to 75%) while also affecting other organs (extra-pulmonary tuberculosis). Currently, rifampicin, a first-line anti-tubercular drug, is given orally and the maximum daily oral dose is the lesser of 10 mg/kg or 600 mg. Since only a small fraction of this dose is available in the lung, concentrations may frequently fail to reach bactericidal levels, and therefore, contribute to the development of multi-drug resistant pulmonary TB. Pulmonary delivery of rifampicin, either alone or in addition to the standard oral dose, has the potential to achieve a high concentration of rifampicin in the lung at a relatively low administered dose that is sufficient to kill bacteria and reduce the development of drug resistance. As yet, no clinical study in humans has reported the pharmacokinetics or the efficacy of pulmonary delivery of rifampicin for TB. This review discusses the opportunities and challenges of rifampicin delivery via the inhaled route and important considerations for future clinical studies on high dose inhaled rifampicin are illustrated.

AB Lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNs) combine the characteristics and beneficial properties of both polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes. The objective of this study was to design and optimize gemcitabine hydrochloride loaded LPHNs based on the central composite design approach. PLGA 50:50/PLGA 65: 35 mass ratio (w/w), soya phosphatidylcholine (SPC)/polymer mass ratio (%, w/w) and amount of DSPE-PEG were chosen as the investigated independent variables. The LPHNs were prepared with modified double emulsion solvent evaporation method and characterized by testing their particle size, encapsulation efficiency, and cumulative release. The composition of optimal formulation was determined as 1,5 (w/w) PLGA 50: 50/PLGA 65: 35 mass ratio, 30% (w/w) SPC/polymer mass ratio and 15 mg DSPE-PEG. The results showed that the optimal formulation gemcitabine hydrochloride loaded LPHNs had encapsulation efficiency of 45,2%, particle size of 237 nm and cumulative release of 62,3% at the end of 24 h. The morphology of LPHNs was found to be spherical by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation. Stability studies showed that LPHNs were physically stable until 12 months at 4 degrees C and 9 months at 25 degrees C/60% RH. The results suggest that the LPHNs can be an effective drug delivery system for hydrophilic active pharmaceutical ingredient.

AB The purpose of this study was to develop self-microemulsifying (SME-) tablets to improve resveratrol solubility whilst delivering resveratrol in a preferred tablet dosage form. Resveratrol was dissolved in liquid self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) (10% w/w) and solidified through adsorption on several different solid carriers. Two ranges of synthetic amorphous silica (Sylysia (R) 290, 350, 470, 580; Syloid (R) 244FP, AL-1FP) as well as granulated magnesium aluminometasilicate (Neusilin (R) US2) were screened for their SMEDDS adsorbent capacity. The most efficient carrier from every range was chosen for further SME-tablet development. To counteract the high ratio of liquid in SME-tablets, additional dry binders (microcrystalline cellulose, copovidone) were added to the tableting mixture, as well as superdisintegrant (croscarmellose sodium) and lubricant (magnesium stearate). Finally, approx. 600 mg tablets were directly pressed using 12mm flat face punch, containing 41.75% SMEDDS. Overall, all tablets exhibited sufficient hardness (> 50 N), although it was negatively affected by higher compression force. Tablets with Neusilin (R) US2 proved to have highest hardness, as granulated structure of Neusilin (R) US2 provided best compaction properties needed for successful direct compression of tablets. All prepared SME tablet formulations disintegrated in under 10 min and formed microemulsions (droplet size < 100 nm) upon dilution with water, with Neusilin (R) US2 tablets exhibiting the lowest droplet size (< 30 nm). While conventional dissolution test indicated incomplete resveratrol release from solid carriers in both pH 1.2 and 6.8 media, no difference fatty acid amount titrated during fasted state in vitro lipolysis between liquid and solid SMEDDS was observed. Moreover, accelerated stability tests confirmed over 90% of trans-resveratrol remained in solid SMEDDS following 90 days at 40 degrees C, with no crystallization of resveratrol observed during that time. To sum up, through adsorption on solid carriers, in particular Neusilin (R) US2, SMEDDS was successfully transformed into a directly compressible mixture and tableted without the loss of its self-microemulsifying ability.

AB Previous data from our research group showed that chitosan-coated poly(isobutylcyanoacrylate) nanoparticles (NPs) (denoted PIBCA/Chito20) exhibited intrinsic anti-Trichomonas vaginalis activity, while PIBCA/pluronic (R) F68 without chitosan (PIBCA/F68) were inactive. However, the mechanism of anti-T. vaginalis activity of chitosan-coated PIBCA NPs is still unknown. Our hypothesis is that chitosan-coated NPs are internalized by the parasite, contrarily to PIBCA/F68. In this investigation, the impact of NP surface on their internalization by the protozoan was studied using flow cytometry and parasite morphological changes after different incubation times with PIBCA/Chito20 NPs were monitored by electron microscopy. Flow-cytometry revealed that PIBCA/Chito20 NPs were uptaken by T. vaginalis as early as 10-min-incubation. Drastic cell morphological transformations were observed from scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy after incubation with PIBCA/Chito20 NPs. Numerous pits were seen on cell membrane since 10 min. Gradual increase in contact time increased NP endocytosis and induced proportional damages to T. vaginalis membrane. Then, investigation of whether PIBCA/Chito20 NPs can improve MTZ anti-T. vaginalis activity was studied using checkerboard experiment. Calculation of fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI = 3.53) showed an additive effect between NPs and MTZ.

AB Poor aqueous solubility, chemical instability, and indiscriminate cytotoxicity have limited clinical development of camptothecin (CPT) as potent anticancer therapeutic. This research aimed at fabricating thermoresponsive nanocomposites that enhance solubility and stability of CPT in aqueous milieu and enable stimulus-induced drug release using magnetic hyperthermia. 1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and L-a-dipalmitoylphosphatidyl glycerol (DPPG) (1:1, mol/mol) were immobilized on the surface of superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (SPIONs) via high affinity avidin-biotin interactions. Heating behavior was assessed using the MFG-1000 magnetic field generator. Encapsulation efficiency and drug release were quantified by fluorescence spectroscopy. Anticancer efficacy of medicated nanoparticles was measured in vitro using Jurkat cells. The results revealed that drug incorporation did not significantly alter particle size, zeta potential, magnetization, and heating properties of lipid-coated SPIONs. Drug loading efficiency was 93.2 +/- 5.1%. Drug release from medicated nanoparticles was significantly faster at temperatures above the lipid transition temperature, reaching 37.8 +/- 2.6% of incorporated payload after 12 min under therapeutically relevant hyperthermia (i.e., 42 degrees C). Medicated SPIONs induced greater cytotoxicity than CPT in solution suggesting synergistic activity of magnetically-induced hyperthermia and drug-induced apoptosis. These results underline the opportunity for thermoresponsive phospholipid-coated SPIONs to enable clinical development of highly lipophilic and chemically unstable drugs such as CPT for stimulus-induced cancer treatment.

   BULK BEHAVIOR; PART I; DRY; INHALER; INHALATION; FORMULATION
AB In recent years there is an increasing interest in the pulmonary delivery of large cohesive powder doses, i.e. drugs with a low potency such as antibiotics or drugs with a high potency that need a substantial fraction of excipient(s) such as vaccines stabilized in sugar glasses. The pulmonary delivery of high powder doses comes with unique challenges. For low potency drugs, the use of excipients should be minimized to limit the powder mass to be inhaled as much as possible. To achieve this objective the inhaler design should be adapted to the properties of the API in order to achieve a compatible combination of the drug formulation and inhaler device. The inhaler should have an appropriate powder dosing principle for which prefilled compartments seem most appropriate. The drug formulation should not only allow for accurate filling of these compartments but also enable efficient compartment emptying during inhalation. The dispersion principle must have the capacity to disperse considerable amounts of powder in a short time frame that allows the powder to reach the deep lung. Last, but not least, the inhaler should be simple and intuitive in use, be cost-effective and exhibit accurate and consistent, preferably patient independent, pulmonary delivery performance.

AB Different types of in-situ forming implants based on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and N-methyl-pyrrolid-one (NMP) were prepared for controlled ocular delivery of dexamethasone. The impact of the volume of the release medium, initial drug content, polymer molecular weight and PLGA concentration on the resulting drug release kinetics were studied and explained based on a thorough physico-chemical characterization of the systems. This included for instance the monitoring of dynamic changes in the implants' wet and dry mass, morphology, PLGA polymer molecular weight, pH of the surrounding bulk fluid and water/NMP contents upon exposure to phosphate buffer pH 7.4. Importantly, the systems can be expected to be rather robust with respect to variations in the vitreous humor volumes encountered in vivo. Interestingly, limited drug solubility effects within the implants as well as in the surrounding aqueous medium play an important role for the control of drug release at a drug loading of only 7.5%. Furthermore, the polymer molecular weight and PLGA concentration in the liquid formulations are decisive for how the polymer precipitates during solvent exchange and for the swelling behavior of the systems. These features determine the resulting inner system structure and the conditions for mass transport. Consequently, they affect the degradation and drug release of the in-situ formed implants.

AB Customisation of sustained and controlled release of contraceptives plays a key role in veterinary applications. A biodegradable projectile containing different doses of contraceptive progesterone was prepared using fused deposition modelling 3D printing. Three concentrations of progesterone (2, 5 and 10% w/w) with polylactic acid was prepared as a 1.75 mm filament by hot melt extrusion. Solvent dissolution tests confirmed the successful incorporation of progesterone in the polymer while microscopic (SEM) studies indicated the drug was melted and thoroughly mixed with the polymer matrix and pore-formation after dissolution. A significant suppression of melting temperature of polymer from 166 to 145 degrees C was noted by thermal analysis (DSC) studies of the drug loaded systems. Interaction between the contraceptive drug and the polymer via hydrogen bonding was revealed from the spectroscopic (FTIR) studies. In vitro release behaviour was assessed over a five-month period, for 2% and 5% progesterone loaded projectiles release profiles fitted zero order whereas 10% loaded projectiles fitted the Higuchi model. Penetration assessment confirmed the drug loaded PLA projectiles provided sufficient specific kinetic energy required to penetrate thin and medium-thickness skins. This work demonstrates the feasibility of fused deposition modelling 3D printing as suitable process for manufacturing ballistic customised drug delivery devices.

AB The present study investigates effect of linkers [zero length (without linker), short length linker (glycine and lysine) and long length linker (PEG1000, PEG2000 and PEG3500)] on pharmacokinetics and toxicity of docetaxel (DTX) and gemcitabine (GEM) bio-conjugates. Conjugates were synthesized via carbodiimide chemistry and characterized by H-1 NMR and FTIR. Conjugation of DTX and GEM via linkers showed diverse physio-chemical and plasma stability profile. Cellular uptake mechanism in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines revealed clathrin mediated internalization of bio-conjugates developed by using long length linkers, leading to higher cytotoxicity compared with free drug congeners. DTX-PEG3500-GEM and DTX-PEG2000-GEM demonstrated 4.21 and 3.81-fold higher AUC((0-infinity)) of GEM in comparison with GEM alone. DTX-PEG2000-GEM and DTX-PEG3500-GEM exhibited reduced hepato-, nephro- and haemolytic toxicity as evident via histopathology, biochemical markers and SEM analysis of RBCs. Conclusively, PEG2000 and PEG3500 significantly improved pharmacokinetics without any sign of toxicity and hence can be explored further for the development of dual-drug conjugates for better therapeutic efficacy.

AB Skin has been increasingly recognized as an important drug administration route with topical formulations, offering a targeted approach for the treatment of several dermatological disorders. The effectiveness of this route is hampered by its natural barrier, the stratum corneum (SC), and hence, different strategies have been investigated to improve percutaneous drug transport. The design of nanodelivery systems, aiming at solving skin delivery issues, have been largely explored, due to their potential to revolutionize dermal therapies, improving therapeutic effectiveness and reducing side effects.
   Apart from nanosystem benefits, the fulfilment of the reproducibility requirements and quality standards still limit their industrial production. The optimization of nanosystem formulation and manufacturing process is complex, usually involving a large number of variables. Therefore, a science-and risk-oriented approach, such as Quality by Design (QbD) will provide a comprehensive and noteworthy knowledge, yielding high quality drug products without extensive regulatory burden.
   This review aims to set up the basis for QbD development approach, encompassing preliminary and systematic risk assessments, with critical process parameters (CPPs) and critical material attributes (CMAs) identification, of different nanosystems potentially used in dermal therapies.

AB The present work focuses on application of an investigational approach to assess the hot-processability of pharmaceutical-grade polymers with a potential for use in the manufacturing of reservoir drug delivery systems via micromolding, and the performance of resulting molded barriers. An inert thermoplastic polymer, ethylcellulose (EC), widely exploited for preparation of prolonged-release systems, was employed as a model component of the release-controlling barriers. Moldability studies were performed with plasticized EC, as such or in admixture with release modifiers, by the use of disk-shaped specimens >= 200 mu m in thickness. The disks turned out to be a suitable tool for evaluation of the dimensional stability and diffusional barrier performance of the investigated materials after demolding. The effect of the amount of triethyl citrate, used as a plasticizer, on hot-processability of EC was assessed. The rate of a model drug diffusion across the polymeric barriers was shown to be influenced by the extent of porosity from the incorporated additives. The investigational approach proposed, of simple and rapid execution, holds potential for streamlining the development of prolonged-release systems produced by micromolding in the form of drug reservoirs, with no need for molds and molding processes to be set up on a case-by-case basis.

ID NANOPARTICLES; NANO; TECHNOLOGY; CHALLENGES; DRYER
AB The preparation of submicron-sized particles is relevant in chemical, food and pharmaceutical applications. In pharmaceutics, spray dried submicron-sized particles (0.1-1 mu m) can increase the dissolution rate as well as the solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs. Since the particle size during spray drying is mainly influenced by the droplet size, the preparation of uniform droplets smaller than 3 mu m is of particular interest. In this work, a two-fluid nozzle was combined with a cyclone droplet separator. Droplets larger than the cut-off size were separated with a cyclone droplet separator and returned to the liquid feed. The aerosol at the outlet of the droplet separator was subsequently dried. The drop size of the conditioned aerosol was small, d(50,3) = 2 mu m, and independent of the liquid-to-gas mass flow ratio and the viscosity of the liquid feed. Thus it only depended on the characteristics of the separator. Finally, the dried particles were spherical in shape and in the submicron-sized range.

AB Numerous films with a dissolved or dispersed active principle within a polymeric matrix have been described in literature. However, the incorporation of solid crystals into the films may influence several relevant properties. Additionally, it has been reported that different polymeric matrices lead to films presenting a different performance. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of the combination of chitosan with carrageenan (kappa-, lambda-, and iota-) as matrices, and of the miconazole nitrate incorporation method, on the films behavior. Mechanical properties, drug release and antifungal activity were evaluated. The state of the drug in the films was analyzed by different techniques. Films showed a homogeneous surface and a thermal protective effect on the drug. The combination of chitosan and lambda-carrageenan leads to films with the highest values of tensile and mucoadhesive strength. Films with solubilized drug displayed slightly higher elongation at break, tensile and mucoadhesive strength and faster drug release than those with suspended miconazole nitrate. However, no differences were found regarding the antifungal activity of the different formulations including time-to-kill curves.

AB Antibiotic combination therapy is promising for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by multi-drug resistant Gram-negative pathogens. Inhaled antibiotic therapy offers the advantage of direct delivery of the drugs to the site of infection, as compared to the parenteral administrations. In this study, we developed composite particle formulations of colistin and meropenem. The formulations were characterized for particle size, morphology, specific surface area, surface chemical composition, in-vitro aerosolization performance and in-vitro antibacterial activity. The combinations demonstrated enhanced antibacterial activity against clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii N16870 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 19147, when compared with antibiotic monotherapy. Spray-dried meropenem alone showed a poor aerosolization performance as indicated by a low fine particle fraction (FPF) of 32.5 +/- 3.3%. Co-spraying with colistin improved the aerosolization of meropenem with up to a two-fold increase in the FPF. Such improvements in aerosolization can be attributed to the enrichment of colistin on the surface of composite particles as indicated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), and the increases in particle porosity. Intermolecular interactions between colistin and meropenem were observed for the combination formulations as measured by FT-IR. In conclusion, our results show that co-spray drying with colistin improves the antibacterial activity and aerosol performance of meropenem and produces a formulation with synergistic bacterial killing.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of composition and characteristics of liquid crystalline phases (LCPs) on cutaneous delivery of methylene blue (MB). LCPs were obtained by mixing Brij97 (R) with water at various ratios; Brij97 (R) : water at 8:2 (F8:2), 7:3 (F7:3), and 6:4 (F6:4) were selected, and MB was incorporated at 0.1%. F8:2 and F7:3 exhibited textures and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) patterns corresponding to lamellar phase, whereas F6:4 displayed characteristics of hexagonal phase. All three LCPs were stable for 9 months, and exhibited thixotropic pseudoplastic behaviour. Increasing water content increased viscosity. All three LCPs released less (3.2- to 6.6-fold) MB than control gel (3.0% hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) + 0.1% MB), demonstrating their ability to sustain release. Despite the lower release, all LCPs improved skin retention of MB at 6 h post-application (1.3- to 2.1-fold) compared to the control gel. Among the LCPs, F8:2-mediated skin retention of MB was more pronounced, followed by F7:3. Consistent with the increased penetration, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) also increased after treatment with the LCPs (2.0-2.8 fold), which suggests their influence on skin barrier. Irritation studies by Hen's Egg Test - Chorioallantoic Membrane (HET-CAM) suggest that F7:3 and F6:4 may be better tolerated by the skin than F8:2.

AB We developed regression models for designing rapid and effective H2O2 decontamination processes in the manufacturing of sterile drug products such as injectables. Decontamination, which is typically performed by using H2O2, is a critical changeover process used to establish a sterile environment for filling products. In the process, there is a trade-off relationship between the duration of the process and the level of sterility assurance that needs to be considered in the design. Our model defines these two items as objective functions and the parameters describing the profile of H2O2 injection and the initial humidity as design variables. Our model also considers aeration, i.e., removal of H2O2 from the environment, as a part of the entire process. This design-oriented modeling considering the entire process is the novelty of the work. Experiments were performed using an industrial isolator to develop and validate a set of regression models that describe the relationship between the design variables and the objective functions. In the application of the model, Pareto-optimal conditions could be indicated given the target H2O2 concentration in aeration, which is useful for the makers of drugs and/or isolators for designing decontamination processes.

AB The limited stability of catanionic vesicles has discouraged their wide use for encapsulation and controlled release of active substances. Their structure can easily break down to form lamellar phases, micelles or rearrange into multilamellar vesicles, as a consequence of small changes in their composition. However, despite the limited stability, catanionic vesicles possess an attractive architecture, which is able to efficiently encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules. Therefore, improving the stability of the vesicles, as well as the control on unilamellar structures, are prerequisites for their wider application range. This study focuses on the impact of beta-cyclodextrins for the stabilization of SDS/CTAB catanionic vesicles. Molar ratio and sample preparation procedures have been investigated to evaluate the temperature stability of catanionic vesicles. Diffusion and spectroscopic techniques evidenced that when beta-cyclodextrins are added, unilamellar structures are stabilized above the multilamellar-unilamellar vesicles critical temperature. The results evidence encouraging perspectives for the use of vesicular nanoreservoirs for drug depot applications.

AB Melanoma is resistant to chemotherapeutics with poor prognosis and high potential of metastasis. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) represents a localized therapeutic modality, as cytotoxicity occurs when light activates photosensitizer (PS) at the tumour site. The aim of this study is dermal delivery of a high molecular weight hydrophilic photosensitizer (PS), ferrous chlorophyllin (Fe-CHL) via transethosomes for treatment of melanoma by PDT.
   Transethosomes were made of phosphatidyl choline, edge activator and 20% w/v Ethanol. They were evaluated for mean size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, ex-vivo permeation, localization in skin layers by transmission electron microscope (TEM), and finally, evaluated in melanoma animal model. Transethosomes of different mean vesicle size were evaluated for their skin retention and permeation through mice skin. TE of similar to 500 nm (E3) being ultradeformable showed deep localization in skin confirmed by ex-vivo and TEM micrographs without permeation of PS to recipient compartment due to its size.
   The proposed study offers successful treatment of resistant melanoma by PDT, where complete tumour regression of small tumours occurred after single PDT, while large tumours after double PDT without recurrence for 8 months. This indicates the efficiency of nanovesicles in PS delivery and the efficiency of Fe-CHL in production of reactive oxygen species.

TI Competing for water: A new approach to understand disintegrant
   performance
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Tablet disintegration; Water uptake; Force development; Binders;
   Disintegrants
ID ASPIRIN TABLETS; DISSOLUTION; LACTOSE; STARCH; FORCE
AB The understanding of tablet disintegration is still incomplete as not all involved factors and processes are known or accounted for. E.g., the negative influence of soluble fillers, on disintegration is usually attributed to increased viscosity due to dissolved filler. When the most common filler, lactose, dissolves, the viscosity increases only slightly. The impact of binders has hardly been studied systematically. In this study, water uptake and force development as well as water sorption experiments were performed of tablets containing either a soluble or an insoluble filler, one of four different binders, and one of four different disintegrants. For both fillers, one disintegrant performed distinctly worse than the others. For the insoluble filler, dibasic calcium phosphate (DCP), sodium starch glycolate resulted in the longest disintegration, for the soluble filler, lactose, croscarmellose sodium performed worst. Based on the experimental results, the authors introduce the competition-for-water hypothesis, which takes into consideration the amount of freely available water molecules and hydration kinetics of excipients. Soluble fillers bind a large number of water molecules in hydrate shells and prevent, therefore, proper disintegrant action. Previously inconsistent observations can be approached with this hypothesis and a better understanding of the underlying processes and explanations is possible.

AB Utilizing the diverse features of biocompatible polymers to target drugs into the tumor/s has been a research hotspot since last decade. Such polymeric conjugates of anti-cancer drugs have proven their potential in providing sustained release of drugs with reduced systemic toxicity and improved tumor retention. Polymers like polyethylene glycol (PEG), N-(2-Hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA), Polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), Polyamidoamine (PAMAM), and others remain exploited for their specific as well as shared characteristics in the rational delivery of anti-cancer agents. Variable nano size, attachment with tumor-specific proteins, responsiveness to stimuli and ability to deliver a wide range of molecules like drugs, antibodies and peptides are some of the achievements of polymeric nano-conjugates so far. Many such conjugates have shown potential clinically which has attracted the researchers and promoted further advancements of the technique. Apart from achievements the polymeric conjugates suffer from shortcomings like poor drug loading and chances of potential chronic-systemic toxicities. The review highlights key findings of research in recent time and advancements taking place in the field of polymeric conjugates of anti-cancer drugs along with the limitations. We have also emphasized on newer and relatively less explored applications of tumor-targeted polymeric conjugates which can add new dimensions to this technique.

AB Formulating active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in the amorphous state can increase their apparent aqueous solubility and dissolution rate and consequently improve their bioavailability. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the ability to stabilize an API in the amorphous state using a solid dispersion of magnesium carbonate nanoparticles within the API. Specifically, high proportions of ibuprofen were able to be stabilized in the amorphous state using as little as 17% wt/wt amorphous magnesium carbonate nanoparticles, and drug release rates 83 times faster than from the crystalline state were achieved. Biocompatibility of the nanoparticles was demonstrated in vitro using human dermal fibroblasts and stability of the nanocomposite formulation was verified with a storage time of six months. The success of this novel formulation provides a promising approach for achieving improved apparent solubility and enhanced bioavailability of drugs.

AB Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor. Despite available therapeutic options, the prognosis for patients with GBM remains very poor. We hypothesized that the intra-operative injection of a photopolymerizable hydrogel into the tumor resection cavity could sustain the release of the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) encapsulated in poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles and prevent GBM recurrence. The tumor was resected 13 days after implantation and a pre-gel solution composed of polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate (PEG-DMA) polymer, a photoinitiator and PTX-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (PTX PLGA-NPs) was injected into the tumor resection cavity. A solid gel filling the whole cavity was formed immediately by photopolymerization using a 400 nm light. PTX in vitro release study showed a burst release (11%) in the first 8 h and a sustained release of 29% over a week. In vitro, U87 MG cells were sensitive to PTX PLGA-NPs with IC50 level of approximately 0.010 mu g/mL. The hydrogel was well-tolerated when implanted in the brain of healthy mice for 2 and 4 months. Administration of PTX PLGA-NPs-loaded hydrogel into the resection cavity of GBM orthotopic model lead to more than 50% long-term survival mice (150 days) compared to the control groups (mean survival time 52 days). This significant delay of recurrence is very promising for the post-resection treatment of GBM.

AB In this work we evaluate the effect of polymer composition and architecture of (PEGylated) polyesters on particle size and paclitaxel (PTX) loading for particles manufactured via microfluidic-assisted, continuous-flow nano-precipitation using two microfluidic chips with different geometries and mixing principles.
   We have prepared poly (D, L-lactic acid-co-caprolactone) (PLCL) from ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of LA and CL mixtures and different (macro) initiators (namely, 1-dodecanol, a MeO-PEG-OH, and a 4-armed star PEG-OH), rendering polyesters that vary in monomer composition (i.e. LA/CL ratios) and architecture (i.e. linear vs 4-armed star). Continuous-flow nanoprecipitation was assayed using two microfluidic chips: a cross-flow chip with a X-shaped mixing junction (2D laminar flow focusing) and a micromixer featuring a Y-shaped mixing junction and a split and recombine path (2D laminar flow focusing convinced with stream lamination for faster mixing). Nanoparticle formulations were produced with Z-average sizes in the range of 30-160 nm, although size selectivity could be seen for different polymer/chip combinations; for instance, smaller particles were obtained with Y-shaped micromixer (30-120 nm), specially for the PEGylated polyesters (30-50 nm), whereas the cross-flow chip systematically produced larger particles (80-160 nm). Loading of the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) was also heavily influenced not only by the nature of the polyester, but also by the geometry of the microfluidic chip; higher drug loadings were obtained with the cross-flow reactor and the star block copolymers. Finally, decreasing the LA/CL ratio generally had a positive effect on drug loading.

AB Local delivery systems from an osteoconductive biomaterial are suggested as a promising strategy to avoid simultaneously peri-implant traumas and to induce tissue regeneration. In this work, it is detailed the design and construction of a multi-drug delivery formulation based on lipid membrane mimetic coated nano-hydroxyapatite, LMm/nano-HA, as a bone-specific drug delivery approach. The optimal LMm/nano-HA formulation was selected after analysing the lipid/nano-HA interaction by dynamic light scattering (DLS),xi-potential, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and UV-vis spectroscopy. After the initial screening, Ciprofloxacin and Ibuprofen simultaneous - load and - release efficiency from selected LMm/nano-HA was assessed. pH-responsive kinetic profiles of local drug distribution were characterized and compared with currently applied systemic doses. Finally, the systems' biocompatibility and drug released activity were positively validated. The obtained results demonstrated that LMm/nano-HA formulations can represent a valuable multi-modal platform in bone tissue therapies.

AB This study focuses on the relationship between drug dissolution properties, physical stability against recrystallization, and specific mechanical energy (SME) from a hot melt extrusion (HME) process of ternary amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) containing indomethacin (IND), HPMC and mesoporous silica (XDP) prepared using different HME screw condition (the number of kneading zones/rotation speed). The screw condition greatly influenced the amorphous characteristics of the processed material and SME values. The higher SME samples demonstrated a larger parachute effect in dissolution test and reduced the rate of recrystallization upon exposure to elevated temperature/humidity conditions, which can be explained from the enhanced miscibility and interactions of IND/HPMC/XDP. The molecular investigation by solid-state NMR (ssNMR) suggested that higher SME input produced better IND/HPMC miscibility and interaction. Interestingly, XDP showed distinct contacts with IND and HPMC in the high-SME samples. The IND-HPMC interaction is not sufficient to maintain a highly mixed ASD at a high drug load without the assistance of XDP. Therefore, SME is a critical parameter for predicting enhanced dissolution and physical stability of IND in ASDs. Moreover, multi-nuclear and multi-dimensional ssNMR provide mechanistic understanding of molecular properties and bring new perspectives for preparation, analysis, and applications of XDP as a pharmaceutical carrier.

AB Recently, low molecular weight gelators are getting increasing interests in pharmaceutical field. In the current study, puerarin (PUE), a natural and bioactive flavonoid from the plant Pueraria lobata, was found to be able to gelate water to form hydrogel during cooling down process of its hot solution. In order to explore its gelation mechanism, the crystallization process, characterization, interaction force, morphology, rheological properties of PUE hydrogel were investigated by polarized light microscopy (PLM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), Karl Fischer (KF), Raman spectrum, H-1-NMR, environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) and rheometer. The results indicated that at a high supersaturation condition, the gelation process of PUE was initiated by nucleation, and then fibers emanated rapidly from the nucleation center. The types of fiber growth changed from "fiber-like" growth to "less-linear" growth as the increase of supersaturation, leading to a denser structure with higher fractal dimension and stronger mechanical properties. Notably, the C=O center dot center dot center dot pi interaction facilitated the gelation assembly process, and the crystallographic mismatch branching played a vital role in constructing the network of PUE hydrogel.

AB The small intestine is generally considered the major site of absorption after oral drug administration. Absorption from the stomach is often disregarded, though passive diffusion across the gastric mucosal barrier is theoretically possible. In this study, an in situ gastric bolus administration model was used to study the gastric absorption of pharmaceutical compounds in fasted and fed state rats. Three drugs [paracetamol (neutral), diclofenac (acidic) and posaconazole (basic)] were administered directly into the stomach as solution (paracetamol and diclofenac) or suspension (posaconazole). Transfer to the intestine was blocked by ligating the pylorus; as a reference, non-ligated conditions were used. Blood samples were collected and gastric absorption was assessed by the appearance of compounds in the systemic circulation. Paracetamol and diclofenac were readily absorbed from the fasted and fed state rat stomach. For paracetamol, the relative contribution of gastric absorption was higher in the fed state compared to the fasted state. Posaconazole absorption was negligible. Since the ability of the stomach to absorb pharmaceutical compounds was clearly confirmed, the present study warrants further research to quantify the contribution of gastric absorption to total gastrointestinal drug absorption.

AB A major complication with enzyme replacement therapy of Factor VIII (FVIII) in Hemophilia A (HA) is the development of anti-drug antibodies. Recently, we have shown that FVIII administration in the presence of heterogeneous phosphatidylserine (PS) nanoparticles derived from a natural source induces tolerance to FVIII, suggesting that PS converts an immunogen to a tolerogen. However, the specific structural features responsible for the immune-regulatory properties of PS is unclear. Identifying a specific PS species that is responsible is critical in order to further develop and optimize this nanoparticle. Further, clinical development of this lipid-based strategy requires optimization of the lipid particle that is homogeneous and synthetic. Here, we investigate the ability of mono-acylated Lyso-PS to induce hypo-responsiveness towards FVIII in HA mice. Administration of both PS and Lyso-PS FVIII significantly reduced anti-FVIII antibody responses despite rechallenge with FVIII. Additionally, the Lyso-PS-mediated effect was shown to be antigen-specific as mice responded normally against a rechallenge with an unrelated antigen, ovalbumin. Furthermore, the hypo-responsiveness observed with Lyso-PS may involve interactions with a specific PS receptor, TIM-4, along with increasing regulatory T-cells. These data indicate that using Lyso-PS allows for a more homogenous formulation in order to induce tolerance towards therapeutic proteins.

AB The pulmonary route of administration has been commonly used for local lung conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Recently, with the advent of new technologies available for both formulation and device design, molecules usually delivered at high doses, such as antibiotics and insulin to treat cystic fibrosis (CF) and diabetes, respectively, can now be delivered by inhalation as a dry powder. These molecules are generally delivered in milligrams instead of traditional microgram quantities. High dose delivery is most commonly achieved via dry powder inhalers (DPIs), breath activated devices designed with a formulated powder containing micronized drug with aerodynamic diameters between 1 and 5 mu m. The powder formulation may also contain other excipients and/or carrier particles to improve the flowability and aerosol dispersion of the powder. A drawback with high doses is that the formulation contains a great number of fine particles, leading to a greater degree of cohesive forces, producing strongly bound agglomerates. With greater cohesive forces holding fine particles together, higher dispersion forces are needed for efficient de-agglomeration and aerosolisation. This requirement of greater dispersion forces has led to different dry powder formulations and vastly different inhaler designs. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the different formulation types, various DPI devices currently available, and how these affect the aerosolisation process and delivery of high dosed inhalable dry powder formulations to the lungs.

AB Layer weight control, delamination and cross-contamination are major challenges in the production of compacted multilayer tablets (MLT). In this work, we describe a novel approach to manufacturing MLT: the Gluing Pills Technology (GPT). High loads of ibuprofen free acid and caffeine anhydrate were blended with microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) and compacted into monolayer tablets. They were glued together via the GPT using solutions of either fish gelatin or polyvinylpyrrolidone K90 as gluing agents with defined viscosity. Factors that have a substantial impact on the deformation behavior of blends (i.e., elastic recovery, tensile strength and porosity) of monolayer tablets were investigated in terms of bilayer tablets manufactured via the GPT. The results indicated that high levels of elastic recovery negatively affected the robustness of GPT bilayer tablets and that the type of gluing agent was critical. Raman microscopy analysis was successfully applied to qualitatively assess the function of gluing layer as a barrier to cross-contamination between two monolayer tablets.
   This study shows the feasibility of the GPT for manufacturing of robust MLT, emphasizing its potential in terms of real-time production of individualized fixed-dose combinations and application in both translational pharmaceutics and personalized medicine.

TI Solid state C-13 NMR spectroscopy provides direct evidence for reaction

AB Steroid molecules have a long history of incorporation into silicone elastomer materials for controlled release drug delivery applications. Previously, based on in vitro release testing and drug content analysis, we demonstrated indirectly that the contraceptive progestin levonorgestrel (LNG) chemically and irreversibly binds to addition cure silicone elastomers, presumably via a hydrosilylation reaction between the levonorgestrel ethynyl group and the hydrosilane groups in the poly(dimethylsiloxane-co-methylhydrosiloxane) crosslinker of the silicone elastomer. Here, for the first time, we report that solid state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provides direct evidence for the irreversible binding of ethinyl estradiol (EE) - an estrogenic steroid molecule also containing an ethynyl functional group - to an addition cure silicone elastomer. By preparing silicone elastomer samples containing C-13-labelled EE, signals in the NMR spectra could readily be assigned to both the free and bound EE. Additional depolymerisation studies, performed on an addition cure silicone elastomer system from which the unbound EE fraction was completely extracted, further confirmed the presence of bound EE through the formation of coloured reaction mixtures resulting from the reaction of bound EE and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). These methods will be particularly useful in the ongoing development of new steroid-releasing silicone drug delivery devices, including various vaginal ring devices for contraception, HIV prevention and multipurpose prevention technology applications.

AB The photoexcitation of materials results in the production of thermal energy (heat) under laser excitation and is an evolving field of research, prompted by the ever-growing demands in the fields of nanotechnology and nanomedicine. Understanding the radiation-to-heat conversion efficiency is, thus, important for the selection of the more suitable materials for photothermal therapeutic applications. To this regard, laser irradiation at near infrared frequencies are indispensable, offering deeper penetration depths in biological tissues, when compared with visible ones. Here, the molar extinction coefficients of SrF2:Yb3+/Er3+ upconverting nanoparticles with diameters 10 +/- 2 nm and 41 +/- 10 nm were calculated at 980 nm as 2.43 M-1 cm(-1) and 2.40 M-1 cm(-1), respectively. The corresponding photothermal conversion efficiencies are 32.0 +/- 1.0% and 11.5 +/- 0.8%, for the 10 nm and 41 nm diameter upconverting nanoparticles, respectively. The photothermal efficiency values of SrF2:Yb3+/Er3+ nanoparticles permit to prospect their future use as photothermal agents.

The segregation coefficient of In3+, Ru4+ and Fe3+ ions were analyzed by an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). The infrared transmittance spectra were measured to investigated the defect structure of In:Ru:Fe:LiNbO3 crystals. The light-induced scattering of In:Ru:Fe:LiNbO3 crystals was characterized quantitatively via the incident exposure energy method. The results show that the ability to resistance light-induced scattering enhanced with the increase of the Li/Nb ratio. The dependence of light-induced scattering on the defect structure of In:Ru:Fe:LiNbO3 crystals was discussed in detail based on the Li-site vacancy model.

AB A design consists of low-index contrast grating is proposed to achieve the narrow absorption response for two-dimensional (2D) materials such as a MoS2 monolayer in the visible wavelength regime. High absorption occurs at the wavelength of Fano resonance for both transverse dielectric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations. It is proved that by manipulating related structural parameters and the incident angle, the peak wavelengths of MoS2 absorption can be tuned in a wide range. In addition, an improved structure with MoS2 ribbons is proposed to further boost the light-MoS2 interaction. The relationships between the absorptance and the period and width of MoS2 ribbons are discussed. The proposed optical devices could be efficiently exploited as tunable absorbing structures for optoelectronics and photovoltaic devices in the visible region.

AB Gold (Au) nanoparticles (NP) embedded borate glasses with the molar composition of (x-0.1) Na2O-10ZnO-(90-x)B2O3-0.1AuCl(3) (x = 10, 20, 30 mol %) have been prepared via melt quench technique. The effect of Na2O content on properties such as optical, structural and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of gold NPs containing sodium zinc borate glasses were studied using UV-Visible absorption, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), High Resolution-Transmission Electron Microscope (HR-TEM) and Z-scan measurements. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements confirmed the glassy nature of the samples. UV-Visible absorption spectra of glasses comprising Au NPs demonstrated a broad surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption peak near 577 nm due to the transition from d-band to the Fermi level and this SPR peak demonstrated a red-shift with increase in Na2O concentration. HR-TEM micrographs revealed the presence of uniformly distributed and spherical shaped Au nanoparticles with an estimated average particle size of similar to 6 nm (+/- 1.5 nm). Nonlinear Optical (NLO) measurements were performed at three different off resonant wavelengths (750 nm, 800 nm, 850 nm) using femtosecond (fs) pulses (150 fs, 80 MHz) delivered by aTi:sapphire oscillator. Saturable Absorption (SA) kind of nonlinearity has been observed in the open aperture (OA) Z-scan data and is attributed to intraband transition within the Au NPs, while the closed aperture (CA) Z-scan data illustrated a negative type of nonlinear refraction attributed to effect of self-defocusing. NLO studies and the obtained nonlinear coefficients suggest that, the NZB glasses are potential candidates for mode-locking and switching applications in near-infrared spectral region.

The films were produced by laser molecular beam epitaxy (LMBE). The spectra revealed the strong inhomogeneous broadening that prevents observation of spectral shifts and splittings due to lattice distortions. The measurements of the fluorescence lifetimes provided an indication of lattice distortions and may be used for diagnostics of the epitaxial oxide films.

AB For the first time, the luminescence decay dependences of I-4(13/2) and I-4(11/2) energy levels on pulsed excitation duration are studied with and without pinhole technique in erbium-doped YAG single crystals. Luminescence decay investigations of I-4(13/2) -> I-4(15/2) (1565 nm) and I-4(11/2) -> I-4(15/2) (970 nm) transitions are carried out on 5 at. % and 40 at.% doped samples. Time-resolved measurements of luminescence decay have demonstrated non-exponential behavior depending on excitation duration as well as impurity concentration, thus, indicating the presence of various energy transfer processes. In order to eliminate the influence of radiation trapping effect on luminescence decay from I-4(13/2) and I-4(11/2) levels the pinhole technique is used. Qualitative comparisons of luminescence decay curves are made to estimate the influence of radiation trapping effect. The influence of non-radiative energy transfer processes on population redistribution of I-4(13/2) and I-4(11/2) energy levels is evaluated. A theoretical model for non-radiative transfer of electronic excitation energy in YAG:Er3+ crystals is proposed, in the frame of which the constants of rate equations are determined. The experimental and theoretical investigations are made for luminescence corresponding to both I-4(13/2) -> I-4(15/3) and I-4(11/2) -> I-4(15/2) transitions. The following non-radiative energy transfer processes are taken into account: I-4(13/2) -> I-4(15/2) + I-4(13/2) -> I-4(9/2), I-4(11/2) -> I-4(15/2) + I-4(11/2) -> F-4(7/2), S-4(3/2)(H-2(11/2)) -> I-4(9/2) + I-4(15/2) -> I-4(13/2), I-4(11/2) -> I-4(15/2) + I-4(13/2) -> F-4(9/2).

AB Great efforts have been made in the last few years to increase the energy efficiency of solar cells. Among several factors which influence their performance, the light harvesting efficiency is the most relevant factor. In order to reduce the transparency losses of sub-bandgap solar photons, especially for wide gap solar cell materials, the development of up-conversion (UC) coatings to transform near infrared (NIR) light into short-wavelength visible photons is clearly a suitable approach. In spite of recent advances, the development of UC materials involves techniques which are generally not cost effective. This work will primarily focus on the evaluation of UC luminescence in aluminosilicate glass phosphors co-doped with the Tb3+/Yb3+ ion pair and synthesized by sol-gel (SG), a technique which is especially adequate to the deposition of films. The optimization of dopant concentrations has also been investigated, together with the structural, morphological and UC emission study of the coatings obtained. Lastly, a potential demonstrator has been developed in the form of a 1-D photonic crystal (PC) microcavity, in order to integrate the spectral conversion function into a more complex but more efficient structure.

X-Ray diffraction patterns reveal ZnO hexagonal zincite structure for the samples, some of which were exposed to beta particle irradiation in the dose range from 0.08 to 2048 Gy in order to study their TL features. The synthesized ZnO:Na samples are more than 200 times more sensitive than ZnO samples synthesized by the same method, and present a 0.02 (1/50) sensitivity relative to the TLD-100 dosimeter.

AB In order to overcome the shortcomings of un-uniformity of two-dimension (2D) material based saturable absorbers (SAs) and improve the performance of consequently generated laser pulses, a kind of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) based SAs was synthesized and employed to form 2 mu m low-threshold pulsed laser. Two SA samples with different density of GNPs were fabricated and their modulation performance was compared under similar condition. Using Tm:YAP as gain medium, the constructed passively Q-switched 2 mu m all-solid-state laser could deliver the shortest laser pulses with duration of 580 ns, repetition rate of 129 kHz and an average output power of 601 mW by using the first SA sample (with high GNPs density), corresponding to a pulse energy of 4.37 mu J and a peak power of 6 W. Laser pulses with a high pulse energy of 6.1 mu J and a peak power of 7.5 W were obtained with the second sample (with low GNPs density). Besides, the formed Q-switched lasers showed very low thresholds because of the large third-order nonlinear coefficient of GNPs. These results showed that the GNPs could be a promising SA for 2 mu m wavelength band.

AB Polarized absorption spectra of ferroborates HoFe3(BO3)(4), NdFe3(BO3)(4) and Ho0.75Nd0.25Fe3(BO3)(4) were measured at room temperature in spectral range 4000-24500 cm(-1) (400-2500 nm). The studied single crystals were grown from solution-melts. Intensities of the f-f transitions were measured and the Judd-Ofelt parameters Omega(lambda) of Ho3+ and Nd3+ ions in the studied crystals were calculated. It was revealed that the crystals content not strongly influences the Judd-Ofelt parameters. The Omega(2) parameter for Ho3+ ion is the most sensitive to the crystal content. Linear dichroism of the hypersensitive transitions appeared to be the largest one for both rare earth ions.

AB Undoped, 0.1 at% Nd and 0.1 at% Pr doped GaSe single crystals were grown by using modified Bridgman method. The nonlinear absorption (NA), second harmonic generation (SHG) and carrier dynamics of undoped, 0.1 at% Nd and 0.1 at% Pr doped GaSe single crystals have been studied by open aperture Z-scan, SHG and transmission ultrafast pump probe spectroscopy experiments, respectively. All of the studied crystals showed nonlinear absorption under 100 fs pulse duration and 1200 nm wavelength excitations. It was found that the doping of Nd3+ and Pr3+ into GaSe single crystals caused shifting of SHG signal peaks to the shorter wavelengths. However, transmission pumb-probe experiments revealed that all of the crystals showed NA signals with long lifetime under 620 nm pump and 626 nm probe excitations.

AB Atomistic numerical simulations have been carried out to study the performance of recently reported optical structures based on nonpolar multiple disk-in-wire In0.08Ga0.92N/GaN material system. The simulations are performed with an augmented version of the open-source NEMO 3-D software that uses a fully-atomistic valence force-field (VFF) for strain distributions and empirical sp(3)s*-spin tight-binding model to compute the electronic structure. Both linear and nonlinear components of internal polarization field have been included using a recently proposed first-principles based polarization model. When compared to conventional c-plane based polar structures, the nonpolar device exhibits a much weaker (yet non-zero) internal potential and improved laser emission characteristics. In particular, it is found that the optical transition probability is a strong function of the internal fields and could be tuned via engineering the spacer size.

AB The photoluminescence films with fascinating luminescence properties have promising applications in various fields, such as field emission displays, up-converting lasers, flat panel displays, biomarkers, and solar cells, etc. In this paper, the Y2O3/ZnO up-conversion films were prepared with sol-gel and spin-coating methods. The X-ray diffractometer (XRD) patterns, field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) image, and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were collected to characterize and analyze these films. The results show that Er3+ and Yb3+ ions were incorporated into the Y2O3/ZnO host successfully without changing the original Y2O3/ZnO matrix structure. The film, which has a rather smooth surface, is composed of nano-grains. All the films are of high transmittance, above 88% in the UV-VIS range, though the transmittance decreases a little with the increase of Er3+ doped concentration. When the film was pumped with a 980-nm laser, two relatively weak green emissions and a strong red one were obtained in the up-conversion emission spectrum, corresponding to the H-2(11/2) -> I-4(15/2), S-4(3/2) -> I-4(15/2) and F-4(9/2) -> I-4(15/2) transitions, respectively. With the increase of Er3+ concentration, the up-conversion luminescence intensities of the films go up and then down, and the optimum concentration for maximum luminescence is about 4 mol%.

The polymer and composite nanofibers were obtained using the electrospinning method from PAN/DMF solutions doped by nanofillers. The investigations of the influence of process parameters on the morphology of the obtained fibrous mats were carried out on the basis of their images of surface topography obtained using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The incorporation of semiconductor nanofillers on the surfaces and in the volume of PAN nanofibers was confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). Spectral investigations of diffusive reflectance and transmittance have been used to determine the absorption as well as the scattering coefficients of the PAN, PAN/TiO2, PAN/Bi2O3, and PAN/SbSI nanofibers. Mechanisms of absorption and energy gaps of the investigated materials have been determined.

AB We investigated the effect of lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiCF3SO3) on the optical properties of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), known as a glassy transparent polymer. The absolute values of the stress-optical coefficients in both the glassy and rubbery states were found to be reduced by the addition of LiCF3SO3. Furthermore, the linear coefficient of thermal expansion of the blend containing 10 wt.% of LiCF3SO3 was lower than that of pure PMMA, suggesting that the birefringence caused by thermal expansion in laminated display systems would be greatly reduced. These results indicate that PMMA/LiCF3SO3 is an appropriate blend for optical films used for liquid crystal displays.

AB Highly photoactive merocyanine 540 is revealed to form charge transfer complex with zinc sulphide and cadmium sulphide nanocrystals confirmed by FT-IR Spectroscopy, Fluorescence emission and UV-Visible spectrophotometer. The semiconducting nanocrystals were synthesized by co-precipitation method and characterized by Fluorescence emission spectroscopy, UV-Visible spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray spectroscopy and Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX). Merocyanine, in different concentrations was chemisorbed on the surface of ZnS and CdS nanomaterial. ZnS and CdS nanoparticles were used in hybrid solar cells in combination with organic polymer. These cells performed good efficiency at (6 x 10(-6) M) dye concentration. The decreased power conversion efficiency with short circuit current density below and above the optimal merocyanine concentration (6 x 10(-6) M) may be due to aggregation of merocyanine dye on CdS nanocrystals and subsequent self-quenching phenomena among dye molecules. The power conversion efficiency of the devices fabricated from P3HT-CdS-MC540 was higher than devices fabricated from P3HT-ZnS-MC540 because of particle size effect.

AB The luminescence properties of septarian have been investigated for the first time in this study, which has been the subject of many studies in both geological and geophysical fields. This sediment with a calcium carbonate structure exhibited high luminescence properties with X-ray excitation. The radioluminescence (RL) and thermoluminescence (TL) properties were investigated as well as their structural (FT-IR, XRD), morphological (SEM), thermal (TG-DTA) and absorption (UV-Vis-NIR) properties of this sediment. The broad RL peak of septarian was observed at 640 nm. There was a significant increase in the RL intensities of the sifted samples compared with the bulk sample. The TL glow curves of septarian irradiated with X-rays exhibited intense main TL glow peak having the maximum temperatures at 116 degrees C and about 390 degrees C with a heating rate of 2 degrees C/s. Also; the TL kinetic parameters were reported; activation energy (E), frequency factor (s) and the order of kinetics (b) of the first peak have been determined in detail by using peak shape (PS) and Computerized Glow Curve Deconvolution (CGCD) methods. SEM and EDS analysis were performed for the two different layers of septarian. The light colored side with the amorphous structure of the sample has more impurities (such as Fe, Al, Zr, K) than the crystallized and darker side.

AB The temperature variation of the emission bands of the YAlO3:Yb3+/Tm3+ nanoperovskite has been analysed under 975 nm excitation to test its performance as a temperature sensor. The emission bands, originating from F-3(2,3) -> H-3(6) and H-3(4) -> H-3(6) transitions, are located at 700 and 800 nm respectively (first biological window of the human tissue), and were measured from room temperature until 470 K. The calibration of the optical sensor has been made by two different methods. In the first one, based on the fluorescence intensity ratio technique, the areas under the two emission bands were used. In the second procedure the ratio of the intensities at two different wavelengths is estimated. The results showed a higher sensitivity in the biophysical temperature range for the fluorescence intensity ratio method, while a better sensitivity was obtained with the second method for temperatures above 340 K. Once the calibration is made, it is possible to monitor the temperature of the nanoperovskite in the aforementioned range while the sample is heated with the laser.

AB The ZnO nanorods were synthesized using hydrothermal method. The morphologies, crystalline nature and optical properties of the synthesized ZnO nanorods were characterized by X-ray diffractometer, High-resolution scanning electron microscopy [HRSEM], and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopic studies. A thin layer of ZnO nanorods were spread on transparent conducting FTO coated glass plate using Doctor Blade method. Natural dyes extracted from Peltophorum pterocarpum and Acalypha amentacea leaves with solvents such as water and ethanol were used as sensitizers to fabricate dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The extracted dyes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy. The FTIR confirms the presence of anthocyanin, carotene and chlorophyll molecules in the dye extracts. The influence on the different parameters such as open circuit voltage (V-OC) short circuit current (J(SC)), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (eta) of the dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were analyzed. The ZnO nanorods provide high specific surface area for dye adsorption and the pathway is efficient for electron transportation.

AB We developed fundamental design principles to enhance absorption and power properties of nanorod TiO2 photo-anode films in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) over a broad wavelength range by embedding plasmonic gold nanoparticles (NPs). The plasmon-induced electric field distribution in nanorod TiO2 photoanode film embedded with sphere gold NPs has been investigated using finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method based on Maxwell equation. The simulation was done for 500 and 1100 nm of incident plane wave wavelength. FDTD simulation indicates that by the localized surface plasmon resonance effect, the strong photo scattering took place and this increase the absorption path length towards near infrared region inside the active area (anode film) of the solar cell. Furthermore, the power absorption increases from the anode-films that embedded metal NPs of small diameter (40-60 nm) with large gap (10-18 nm) to that of the metal NPs of large diameter (100-150 nm) with small gap (2-6 nm).

AB Ag-based thin films with different topography were prepared by annealing process and laser irradiation, respectively. The tunability of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) was realized by adjusting the cover layer thickness of ITO or TiO2. The effect of dielectric environment of Ag-based composite thin films on structure, surface morphology and optical property was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), UV-VIS-NIR double beam spectrometer and Raman system, respectively. With the thickness of dielectric layer increasing, the topography of as-irradiated Ag-based thin films became smoother while the as-annealed Ag-based thin films had a rougher surface. LSPR absorption of both ITO/Ag and TiO2/Ag bilayers showed red shift with the thickness of dielectric layer increasing. The electromagnetic field coupling between dielectric layers and Ag thin films contributed to increase significantly the sensitivity of surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Additionally, the result of finite-difference time domain (FDTD) simulation was in good agreement with that of the experiment.

AB Optical and structural study of undoped GaN powders obtained by nitridation of metallic gallium and pyrolysis of Ga(NO3)(3)-CH6N4O polymer were made. A high synthesis efficiency for the nitridation of metallic gallium was observed, while the pyrolysis synthesis of the Ga(NO3)(3)-CH6N4O polymer was very low. The XRD patterns showed an intense peak in the orientation (101) of the hexagonal GaN in both cases. The photoluminescence spectrum for nitridation technique of metallic gallium at room temperature, shown how the point defects generated during the preparation of GaN powders allow the adequate incorporation of nitrogen and favor the crystal growth (sizes up to 3.6 mu m length and 3 pm wide). The visible separation in the micro-Raman spectrum of the E1 and E2 modes in the samples obtained by nitridation of metallic gallium was an indicative of the contribution of interstitial gallium in the lattice vibration, an aspect not reported yet. On the other hand, SEM studies confirmed the higher crystalline size of the material obtained by nitridation of metallic gallium compared with the synthesized by pyrolysis of the Ga(NO3)(3)-CH6N4O metalorganic complex polymer.

AB Luminescence enhanced by new structure of plasmonic platform with aluminum oxide (Al2O3) buffer layer deposited on gold nanostructures is investigated. Regularly distributed gold nanostructures of average dimension of 50 mu formed the active part of plasmonic platforms. They were manufactured on Corning 1737 glass substrate by melting of gold thin film. The nanostructures were coated by dielectric Al2O3 thin film with thickness of 6 nm deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) method. Thin film of Valrubicin as a luminescence material was deposited on prepared substrates by spin-coating technique. Luminescence spectra show that designed plasmonic platform with Al2O3 thin film between gold nanostructures and Valrubicin enhanced fluorescence intensity by about 4.5 times.

Their optical and luminescence properties were analyzed via absorption, photoluminescence and decay time measurements. Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters (Omega(lambda), lambda = 2,4,6) obtained from the absorption spectrum follow the trend Omega(4) > Omega(2) > Omega(6). Photoluminescence spectra revealed a dominant emission band at 597 nm which was attributed to (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(7/2) transition. From the emission spectra and JuddOfelt intensity parameters radiative properties including transition probabilities (A), radiative decay times (tau(R)), branching ratio (beta(R)) and stimulated emission cross-section (sigma(E)(rho)) were calculated. The decay curves of (4)G(5/2) level exhibited non-exponential behavior and well fitted to Inokuti-Hirayama model for S = 6. The analyzed spectroscopic properties viz. A, beta(R), sigma(E)(rho) and CIE chromaticity coordinates demonstrate the suitability of BGGS1.00 glass for visible reddish-orange laser applications among the prepared glasses.

AB Metal nanoparticls deposited on substrate are usually used for the enhancement of fluorescent molecules. In this article, AAO template was introduced into the reaction solution during the preparation of silver nanowires. Then the AAO template with deposited silver nanowires was suspended in RhB solution to study its fluorescence enhancement effect. The results showed that the uneven surface of AAO template caused a series of distances between silver nanowires and RhB molecules which were happen to be below 10 nm that can effectively enhance the fluorescence of RhB solution. Our research is helpful to the study of fluorescence enhancement of metal nanostructures deposited on substrate.

AB A surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate composed of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) was synthesized by spark discharge deposition (SDD). The spark-ablated species were directly deposited on a copper substrate at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Sharp and reproducible SERRS signals from the model molecule Rhodamine B (Rh B) were observed from the prepared substrates. Under optimized deposition conditions, the detection limit of Rh B reached the single molecular level (1.0 x 10(-16) M) with an enhancement factor of 3.9 x 10(12). This substrate also provided excellent SERS activity toward crystal violet molecule and the representative biomolecule adenine. We were further interested to find that the activity of the prepared substrate responded very sensitively when we changed the morphology of the deposited NPs by adjusting the operating parameters. An increase in the spark time to 20 min increased the particle size and filling factor, which induced the particles to grow into self-assembled dendrite-like structures. We observed the highest intensity in an Ag NP film with an average particle size of 45 nm and filling factor of 0.57. We speculate that the high sensitivity of this substrate may have derived from the high electromagnetic field produced by the tuning of the particle size and the formation of nanogaps (hot spots) between adjacent particles. This method offers a simple, cost effective, eco-friendly route to the synthesis of highly sensitive, reproducible SERS substrates.

AB Spectral conversion of the sunlight has been proposed as a method for enhancing the efficiency of photovoltaic devices, which are limited in current production by the mismatch between the solar spectrum and the wavelength range for efficient carrier generation. For example, the photo current can be increased by conversion of two low-energy photons (below the band gap of the absorber) to one higher-energy photon (i.e. upconversion). In this paper, we will review our ongoing activities aimed at enhancing such spectral-conversion processes by employing appropriately designed plasmonic nanoparticles. The nanoparticles serve as light-concentrating elements in order to enhance the non-linear upconversion process. From the theoretical side, we approach the optimization of nanoparticles by finite-element modelling of the plasmonic near fields in combination with topological optimization of the particle geometries. Experimentally, the nanostructures are formed by electron beam lithography on thin films of Er3+-containing transparent materials, foremost TiO2 made by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering, and layers of chemically synthesized NaYF4 nanoparticles. The properties of the upconverter are measured using a variety of optical methods, including time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy on erbium transitions and spectrally resolved upconversion-yield measurements at similar to 1500-nm-fight excitation. The calculated near-field enhancements are validated using a technique of near-field-enhanced ablation by tunable, ultrashort laser pulses.

AB Two azine derivatives (NO(Cl) and NS(Cl)) with different electronegative central core were prepared and spectroscopically characterized. Their ultrafast third-order nonlinear optical (NLO) responses were investigated using open aperture Z-scan and optical limiting method with 190 fs laser pulses at 515 nm. The frontier molecular orbitals and energy gaps of samples were obtained through quantum chemical calculation. Transient absorption spectra demonstrated that the origin of strong NLO absorption of two molecules was attributed to excited-state absorption. A simplified three-energy-level model was used to determine their photo-physical parameters. Our results show that the stronger the electronegative cationic groups is, the stronger the NLO absorption performs. The azine compounds have large excited-state lifetime and large ratio of singlet excited state absorption cross-section to that of ground state cross-section (similar to 20.2), indicating it is a candidate material for future ultrafast optical limiters.

AB Generation of bright white-light emitting diode is essential for electronic indicator and low-power lighting applications. Therefore, synthesis of white light emitting material with high quantum efficiency is highly desired. Herein, we report a facile approach to synthesize white light emitting material, i.e. pyrrolic nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots (pN-GQDs) via a solvothermal method. It was found that the pN-GQDs photoluminescence properties, i.e. emission wavelength, intensity and spectrum width, depend on the concentration of pyrolic nitrogen. In typical process, the pN-GQDs sample can emit white light, spectrum width as high as 350 nm, with brightness increase with the increasing of pyrrolic nitrogen. This characteristic is promising for white light emitting diode fabrication, hence lighting application. The synthetic approach of pN-GQDs preparation and characterization will be discussed.

AB Computational and experimental methods are employed to study the optical properties of Dy-doped BaAl2O4 matrix. Atomistic modelling is used to make predictions of Dy doping sites and charge compensation schemes. The symmetry predicts from atomistic modeling was used to calculate crystal field parameters and to obtain the energies of the electronic transitions of the Dy3+ ion. Dy-doped BaAl2O4 was prepared via a sol-gel proteic technique. The optical properties were studied using X-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL) measurements. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) at the Ba and Eu L-III-edges exhibits typical absorption spectra. The area under the XEOL spectra increases as the photon energy increases in the region around the Ba and Dy LIB-edges. The XEOL spectra showed typical Dy lines. Experimental and calculated values for the transition energies are compared. Computational and experimental methods are employed to study of Dy-doped BaAl2O4 matrix. Atomistic modelling is used to make predictions of Dy doping sites. The optical properties were studied using XEOL measurements.

AB The properties of the electron spectrum in non-uniform single- and multi-hilled semiconductor quantum ribbons are theoretically investigated taking into account the presence of externally applied electric and magnetic fields. The calculation is carried out within the effective mass and parabolic band approximations, using an adiabatic approach combined with a diagonalization scheme with the GaAs as the prototype material. The features of the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in the structure, and the effect of the changes in the geometry and in the applied electric field onto the optical absorption and refractive index change are discussed. The phenomenon of electric field-induced optical transparency is revealed and discussed.

AB The present paper reports deviation in the intensity of light transmitted through the film of ZnO spherical nanostructure (SNSs) with the exposure of humidity at room temperature. For this purpose, the precursor of ZnO SNSs was prepared and used for coating thin film on borosilicate substrates. The efficient dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promisingly low-cost molecular solar cell devices. ZnO SNSs are promising materials used to use to create photoanodes for DSSCs. The film was then investigated using SEM, HR-TEM, XRD and UV-visible transmittance techniques. Further, it was employed as transmission based optical humidity sensor, the maximum sensitivity of which was found a similar to 1.81 mu W/%RH with response and recovery time of 36 s and 124 s respectively. The sensor showed similar to 97% reproducible results. The fabricated ZnO SPSs based DSSC shows a short circuit current density (J(sc)) of 3 mA/cm(2), open circuit voltage (V-oc) of 0.62 V and efficiency (eta) of 1.3% at one sun condition.

AB TiO2 filled polymer based bracket is used in commercialized low and mid-power UVA-LEDs. However, the strong UVA absorption of TiO2 reduces the light output. This paper reports the preparation and properties of an Al2O3 filled polymer based bracket material. Comparing with the conventional TiO2+SiO2 filled composite, the Al2O3+SiO2 filled composite shows a 1.2 times' improvement in optical reflection at 365 nm. The flexural strength and resilience of Al2O3+SiO2 filled composite are superior to the reference. Optical simulation of two UVA-LEDs packages shows a 9% improvement in optical output when Al2O3+SiO2 filled bracket is applied. Besides, the Al2O3+SiO2 filled composites also have better high-temperature reliability, higher glass transition temperature, comparable thermal stability and water absorption performance, which can be considered as a potential candidate to improve the performance of UVA-LEDs.

AB The continental sequences of Gondwana deposits from the Chintalapudi sub-basin of the Godavari Graben, South India have been palynologically investigated to explore the Permian-Triassic palynoflora. Total 11 distinct palynoassemblages belonging to the Asselian-Sakmarian (I, II), Artinskian (III, IV), Guadalupian (V, VI), Lopingian (VII, VIII, IX), Induan (X) and Olenekian (XI) age have been documented. The palynological studies support the existence of the two coal-bearing horizons in the Chintalapudi sub-basin, one in the Karharbari and Barakar formations (Sakmarian-Artinskian) while other in the Raniganj Formation (Guadalupian-Lopingian). The lack of the Upper Barakar and Barren Measures (Roadian) palynoflora indicates apparent discordance in stratigraphic sequence in this sub-basin. Presently studied the Permian-Triassic palynofloral transition has been found akin to the palynoflora of the Salt Range, Madagascar, Antarctica, Australia and South Africa. The palynofloral correlation supports the presence of Guttulapollenites palaeophytogeographic province in the Gondwana during the Guadalupian-Lopingian. The Guttulapollenites palaeophytogeographic province co-exists with the Glossopteris megafloral province and extends from the Salt Range in the north to Amery Basin in the south, Mid Zambesi-Luangwa Basin in the west to Satpura-Wardha-Godavari Basin in the east.

AB The Plio-Pleistocene Siwalik deposits around Chandigarh, well known for their great wealth of mammalian fossils, preserve a continuous record of calcareous paleosols ranging in age from similar to 2.7 to similar to 0.6 Ma. The carbon isotope composition (delta C-13 relative to Vienna Peedee belemnite [VPDB]) of 140 pedogenic carbonates from Ghaggar and Nadah sections and 13 gastropod samples from Nadah section record a landscape primarily occupied by C4 grasses during this interval. However, a mixed C3-C4 vegetation between 2.15 and 1.7 Ma and a progressive increase in the percentage of C3 plants from similar to 1.1 to similar to 0.6 Ma has been recorded. Most of the pedogenic carbonate 818O values (VPDB) in the Ghaggar River Section range between - 5.29 and - 8.93%o indicating the dominance of monsoon climate. These delta O-18 values exhibit somewhat consistent trend in relation to 513C values suggesting influence of climate on the vegetation. At two instances similar to 1.07 and similar to 0.66 Ma, there is significant depletion in carbonate delta O-18 and delta C-13 values, suggesting monsoon intensification and a synchronous development of C3 vegetation. Pedogenic carbonate and gastropod delta O-18 values (VPDB) in the Nadah paleoswamp, also exhibit consistent trends in relation to delta C-13 values, indicating steady relationship between short-term climatic fluctuations in terms of warm-humid and cool-dry conditions and the abundance of C3/C4 biomass on the landscape nearly 1.8 Ma ago. The vegetation change on the Siwalik landscape during Early and Middle Pleistocene appears to have been influenced mainly by the regional tectonics, sedimentation patterns and monsoonal rains rather than global climate changes.

AB The lithosphere beneath the Archaean Dharwar craton was investigated with an east-west oriented, 280 km long profile (from Yellapura to Sindhanur) with 22 magnetotelluric stations. Regional strike directions, estimated were - 5 degrees and 13 degrees for the crust and the lithospheric mantle respectively. Our results indicate in western Dharwar craton, presence of low resistivity zones in the crust besides two significant upper mantle conductive features within the highly resistive Archaean lithosphere. We analyze the available geophysical data that include heat flow, seismic tomography and magnetotellurics (MT) from the Dharwar craton. Our inference supports to the existence of a thick lithosphere. A thickness of more than 200 km is estimated for the lithosphere beneath the Dharwar craton by our magnetotelluric model. The study has brought out the presence of lithospheric upper mantle conductive features in the depth range of 100-200 km bounded to the west part of the magnetotelluric profile. Significant variations in conductivity are seen on either side of the Chitradurga shear zone. The conductive feature in the depth range 120-150 km is related with kimberlite melts and the conductive nature in the depth range 160-200 km is explained by refertilization process, as craton passed over the Marion (ca. 90 Ma) hotspot.

AB Studying the faults in Wuhai Basin, which is located in the northwestern corner of the Ordos Block in China, can not only guide earthquake-safe construction in the region, but also provide a greater understanding of the structure of the Wuhai Basin and the dynamic environment of Northwestern Ordos Block. In this study, we effectively detected the Yellow River buried Fault (YRF), which we believe currently presents a risk to human life in the area. First, we laid out a deep seismic reflection profile (DSRP) in the north of the Wuhai Basin and found that the YRF is composed of two subparallel faults, the east branch of the Yellow River buried Fault (EYF) and the west branch of the Yellow River buried Fault (WYF), which formed a Y-type graben in the section. We then used 25 shallow seismic exploration profiles to find out how the faults are distributed. Finally, we used drillings and Quaternary dating methods to certify their existence and obtain their activity parameters. We used the sequence stratigraphy method to compare sediment strata and identified paleo-earthquake events by finding the unequal thickness layers (UTLs) on both sides of the fault. The drillings revealed that four earthquakes occurred on the YRF around 25.6 +/- 0.11 ka BP, 39.5 +/- 0.45-41.7 +/- 0.57 ka BP, 58.25 +/- 7.13 ka BP, and 111 +/- 1.21 ka BP. Since the last activity on the YRF occurred much longer ago than its estimated recurrence cycle, we believe that the fault YRF currently presents a dangerous risk. Our study confirms that the YRF is a normal fault graben and that the Wuhai Bain is an extensional basin formed by the relative movement of the Tibetan Plateau, the Alashan Block, and the Ordos Block.

AB Organic matter is believed to trigger the formation of high As groundwater, which has been widely found in China. Sixty-three groundwater samples, seven multilevel-well groundwater samples and four surface water samples were collected to trace and delineate groundwater organic matter by using stable carbon isotopes of dissolved organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon, and sedimentary organic carbon in this study. Low delta C-13(DIC) mainly occurred in high As groundwater in the flat plain area. High As concentrations corresponding to high delta C-13(DOC) values indicated that As was released during microbial degradation of DOC coupled with reduction of Fe oxides. Along the flow path, delta(13)(DIC), ORP values and SO4/Cl ratios showed decreasing trends with the increases in As and dissolved Fe concentrations, illustrating a gradual increase in anaerobic microbial activities that caused reductive dissolution of Fe oxides and As enrichment. Results of groundwater samples from a multi-level well showed that small Delta delta (defined as the difference between delta C-13(DOC) and delta(13)(DIC)) indicated that more sufficient DOC degradation contributed to groundwater DIC concentrations and facilitated groundwater As mobilization.

AB A new shear-wave velocity model of the central Tien Shan is determined using seismic ambient noise tomography. Continuous seismic data are used to generate the three-dimensional shear-wave velocity structure. These data are recorded at 38 broadband seismic stations from the GHENGIS and KNET seismic networks in the central Tien Shan during June 1999 and August 2000. Our new tomographic model reveals prominent lateral hetero-geneities in the central Tien Shan region. The shallow structure beneath the central Tien Shan shows a good spatial correlation with surface tectonics. Low- and high-velocity anomalies are imaged beneath basins and surrounding mountain ranges, respectively. Most large earthquakes are mainly distributed in the low-velocity anomalies or the transition zones from high- to low-velocity anomalies, suggesting most large earthquakes are not only associated with active faults but also related to the low-velocity anomalies. Pronounced low-velocity anomalies are imaged in the middle crust beneath the high-elevated mountain ranges, whereas a reverse structure can be seen beneath low-elevated basin ranges, which implies that the low-velocity anomalies caused by the upwelling of the hot and wet material into the crust from the upper mantle could have played an important role in the mountain building beneath the Tien Shan region. All these results provide seismic evidence for better understanding the dynamics process of the Tien Shan mountain building.

AB To investigate the lithospheric structure and deformation of the Tibetan Plateau, we present thermo-rheological models for two transects across the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SE Tibet), showing strong lateral heterogeneity. The geodynamic implications are also investigated in relation to GPS motions, seismic anisotropy, seismicity distribution and crustal isostatic state. The unmatched pattern between Pms and SKS splittings which even intersect at right angles to the south of 26 degrees N, suggests the crust-mantle decoupling. Constrained by a brittle load-bearing layer at the uppermost mantle beneath the Indochina block, the decoupling may occur below the uppermost mantle. The strong crust beneath the South China plate and Indochina block implied by the seismicity distribution, has two thick brittle load-bearing layers, indicating a coupled system. The crust beneath the Emeishan large igneous province (ELIP) also has two brittle load-bearing layers, but the brittle deformation is restricted to the topmost 10 km of the upper and lower crust. Only one brittle load-bearing layer resides in the upper crust in the other part of the Chuandian block. Combining with GPS and Pms splitting, we can infer that the weak crust with seismicity restricted into the depth of < 30 km beneath the Chuandian block becomes decoupled. The heterogeneous rheological behavior under SE Tibet is further supported by different crustal isostatic states among the blocks. Through the comparison with observations in the central-northern Tibetan Plateau and Chuandian block, we suggest that the layers with aqueous fluids and (or) partial melting are distributed only in some place/channels of the weak middle-lower crust.

AB The electron spin resonance (ESR) dating method is thought to be limited to the Quaternary period. In this study, we attempt to expand the ESR dating range to the pre-Quaternary using three fault-zone samples collected from faults in the Sichuan basin and its surroundings. We adopt a gamma-ray radiation dose of up to 2 x 10(4) Gy, which is much greater than that typically employed, and find that the ESR intensity of the E-1' center (a type of signal for ESR dating) in quartz continuously increases with the gamma-ray dose and is slightly influenced by the radiation dose rate. This indicates the potential of ESR to date pre-Quaternary faults. By simulating environmental radiation under geological burial conditions, we use ESR to date the latest extension event in the western Hubei and Hunan thrust belt to 9.17 +/- 0.76 Ma and the thrusting of the Longmenshan fault zone toward the Sichuan basin to approximately 6.14 +/- 0.73 Ma. Conversely, the saturated ESR intensity of fault-zone samples from the Daba fault zone suggests a lack of strong tectonic activity in the southern Daba fault zone in the last 10 Ma. Our results are consistent with fission track ages and the regional tectonic evolution history. Therefore, ESR is a practical method for dating pre-Quaternary faults in structural and petroleum geology applications.

Based on the integrated sedimentary fades analysis, a relative sea-level curve for the Berriasian-Valanginian interval has been established, including stacking pattern of the different facies cycles. Two transgressive-regressive facies cycles have been identified and documented in the studied sections. The first cycle started during the middle Berriasian (similar to 143 Ma), comprising the Silayy and Yamamah formations. It terminated at the Yamamah-Buwaib formational contact during the early Valanginian (similar to 138 Ma), characterized by a friable brownish ferruginous sandstone bed at the base of the Buwaib Formation. The second transgressive-regressive cycle encompasses the entire lower Valanginian Buwaib Formation. A major unconformity surface formed during the early late Valanginian (similar to 136 Ma), marking the end of the second cycle and characterized by a distinctive hardground condensation. The correlation and dating of the recognized cycles, identified in central Saudi Arabia, shows a contemporaneity to equivalent surfaces globally and thus strongly supports an isochronous formation of Berriasian-Valanginian facies cycles by eustatic sea-level changes.

AB The probabilistic seismic ground-motion hazard maps for the Peninsular Malaysia region have been developed by the present study. Despite the earlier seismic hazard maps for this region, which were proposed only based on far-field Sumatran seismic sources, this study has attempted to present the new maps using the combination of the local faults within the region, Sumatran fault, and Sumatran subduction source zones. The composite earthquake catalogue of the study region has been extended to cover an area limited by 10 degrees S-10 degrees N Latitude and 90 degrees-110 degrees E Longitude with the period from 1900 to 2014. The seismic source zones were categorized into subduction and fault sources. Line, area, and background source models were used to model the seismic sources with variable characteristics along them. In order to consider the epistemic uncertainty, logic-tree framework was used to incorporate basic quantities such as different source modelling, maximum magnitudes, and ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs). The hazard maps are presented over a 12.5 km grid in terms of peak ground acceleration (PGA) for 10 and 2% probabilities of exceedance in 50 years corresponding to 475 and 2475 years return periods (RP), respectively. The proposed new hazard maps give the expected ground motions based on the extended earthquake catalogue, upgraded seismic source parameters, and more compatible GMPEs than applied in the development of previous hazard maps. The estimated PGAs on rock site condition across the Peninsular Malaysia region for RP475 and 2475 years are in the range of 1.0-10.0%g and 2.0-20.0%g, respectively. The horizontal elastic acceleration response spectra on different soil site conditions have been also presented for the region of interest following the principles of Eurocode 8 through the calculated uniform hazard spectra.

AB Proxy records from radial sand ridge fields are essential for understanding sedimentary environmental changes forced by climate-driven coast and sea level variations that affect large river inlets. We conducted a systematic environmental magnetic study on sediments from a radial sand ridge field in the South Yellow Sea, eastern China. From 41.6 to 0 m, the sediments of core YZ07 derive from river mouth, littoral and modem tidal flat environments. Magnetic measurements indicate that magnetite and hematite dominate the studied magnetic mineral assemblages. Magnetic mineral contents are highest in the river mouth environment and lowest in the modern tidal flat environment. The magnetic minerals in the core YZ07 sediments can be attributed primarily to detrital inputs rather than biogenic sources. The highest chi and SIRM values and lowest chi(ARM)/SIRM and chi(ARM)/chi values reflect relatively warm and humid climate conditions respectively during the period similar to 7000 to 2900 a B.P. (41.6-24.73 m). Compared with the period similar to 7000 to 2900 a B.P. (41.6-24.73 m), the period between similar to 2900 and 870 a B.P. (24.73-5.14 m) is characterized by lower chi, chi(ARM) and SIRM values and higher chi(ARM)/SIRM and chi(ARM)/chi values, which indicate cool and dry climatic conditions. Our results reconfirm known regional climatic events that demonstrate Holocene climatic instability. Gradual decreases in chi and SIRM and increases in chi(ARM)/SIRM, chi(ARM)/chi and chi(fd) characterize the sediments after 870 a B.P. (5.14-0 m). As indicated in previous studies, these changes were influenced by diversion of the Yellow River. Additionally, spectral analysis of the chi and chi(ARM)/SIRM records reveals rapid climatic fluctuations on millennial and centennial scales that coincide with those recorded in marine sedimentary records from adjacent regional seas. These results are important for investigations into the interactions between regional systems and global change in monsoonal climatic regions, thus providing an example of the evolution of a large scale geomorphic feature resulting from river-sea interaction.

AB The sedimentation history of northeastern Himalayan Proterozoic basins is poorly known. In the current study, we examine major, trace, rare earth elements (REEs) and Sr-Nd isotope geochemistry of pelites and quartzites from Mesoproterozoic metasedimenatary sequences of Bomdila and Rupa Groups, NE Himalaya in order to understand provenance, tectonic setting and paleoweathering conditions of deposition. The salient geochemical parameters, such as, high SiO2 and Al2O3 concentrations, relatively low MgO values, typical enrichment of immobile incompatible elements (Al2O3/TiO2 = 32.2, Th/Sc = 2.1), fractionated REE patterns (La/Yb-n = 28) and a strong negative europium anomaly (Eu/Eu* = 0.3-0.7) indicate dominant felsic source for Bomdila sediments. Bomdila sediments show significantly radiogenic epsilon Nd-0.95Ga values ( -10.25 to - 17.90, avg. - 15.24) compared to Bundelkhand craton (avg. - 26) and Singhbhum craton (avg. - 30) and yield much younger Tom ages (2.3-2.7 Ga) compared to Archean Bundelkhand (3.2-3.5 Ga) and Singhbhum cratons (3.4-3.9 Ga). These results clearly rule out any significant detritus contribution from old cratonic sources. epsilon Nd and T-DM data of Mesoprterozoic Bomdila sediments envelop the signature of Lower Proterozoic Inner Lesser Himalayan (ILH) terrane. Prominent U-Pb age peaks at 1702, 1651, similar to 1400, 1248 and 1118 Ma in detrital zircons indicate major contribution from Late Paleoroterozoic to Late Mesoproterozic sources. However, initial Nd isotope ratios and T-DM do not favour any juvenile inputs. We argue that ILH source terrain may have been extensively reworked during Late Paleoroterozoic to Late Mesoproterozic time and could have been part of a long lived orogenic belt.. Severe depletion of Ca, Na and Sr in Bomdila sediments indicate intense chemical weathering of the source region, and can be attributed to warm and humid climatic conditions, a conclusion which is consistent with the CO2-rich atmosphere during Mesoproterozoic period.

AB The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK aka North Korea) conducted underground nuclear explosions on October 9, 2006 (M 4.3), May 25, 2009 (M 4.7) and February 12, 2013 (M 5.1). We expanded standard depth calculation methods to encompass full depth utilizing spectral nulls of spectra using body waves and Rayleigh waves from local and teleseismic arrays. The depths of burial were calculated from the fundamental-mode Rayleigh wave spectra as well as the average spectra of depth phase (pP + P/sP + P, pPn + Pn/sPn + Pn) considering take-off angles based on the flat Earth model. The average depths of the 2006, 2009 and 2013 nuclear tests were thus estimated at 2.12 km, 2.06 km and 2.05 km, respectively. It should be noted that those depths are significantly greater than expected from the standard experiment practice. The possibility of the over-buried nuclear tests would affect the interpretation of M-s-m(b) discriminants as well as the estimation of the yield.

AB The icosahedral hexagonal grid is a quasi-uniform discretization of the sphere, generated as the dual of a triangular grid derived by successively refining the faces of an icosahedron embedded in the sphere. This grid contains twelve pentagonal cells and a large number of hexagonal cells, and the bounded area ratio between the smallest and largest cells eliminates polar singularities.
   This structure, however, makes the derivation of high-order numerical methods more difficult than for grids with a more regular structure. This work progresses towards the goal of high-order operators for the dynamical core of a global atmospheric model by developing a nonstaggered finite volume method on this grid, featuring upwinding applied only when necessary for stability, using an edge-centered reconstruction that directly accommodates the grid's intrinsic curvature.
   These operators compute the cell-average divergence, curl, and gradient with accuracy between second and fourth order for test functions. When applied to shallow water test cases, the resulting method is between third and fourth order accurate for the transport equation and between second and third order accurate for the full shallow water system.

AB A spectral radius scaling semi-implicit time stepping scheme has been developed for simulating unsteady compressible reactive flows with detailed chemistry, in which the spectral radius in the LUSGS scheme has been augmented to account for viscous/diffusive and reactive terms and a scalar matrix is proposed to approximate the chemical Jacobian using the minimum species destruction timescale. The performance of the semi-implicit scheme, together with a third-order explicit Runge-Kutta scheme and a Strang splitting scheme, have been investigated in auto-ignition and laminar premixed and nonpremixed flames of three representative fuels, e.g., hydrogen, methane, and n-heptane. Results show that the minimum species destruction time scale can well represent the smallest chemical time scale in reactive flows and the proposed scheme can significantly increase the allowable time steps in simulations. The scheme is stable when the time step is as large as 10 mu s, which is about three to five orders of magnitude larger than the smallest time scales in various tests considered. For the test flames considered, the semi-implicit scheme achieves second order of accuracy in time. Moreover, the errors in quantities of interest are smaller than those from the Strang splitting scheme indicating the accuracy gain when the reaction and transport terms are solved coupled. Results also show that the relative efficiency of different schemes depends on fuel mechanisms and test flames. When the minimum time scale in reactive flows is governed by transport processes instead of chemical reactions, the proposed semi-implicit scheme is more efficient than the splitting scheme. Otherwise, the relative efficiency depends on the cost in sub-iterations for convergence within each time step and in the integration for chemistry substep. Then, the capability of the compressible reacting flow solver and the proposed semi-implicit scheme is demonstrated for capturing the hydrogen detonation waves. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is demonstrated in a two-dimensional hydrogen/air diffusion flame. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

One major challenge consists in the computation of low-failure probability in cases characterized by multiple-failure regions, especially when an unbiased estimation of the error is required. Methods developed in literature rely mostly on the construction of an adaptive surrogate, tackling some problems such as the metamodel building criterion and the global computational cost, at the price of a generally biased estimation of the failure probability. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm suitable for low-failure probability and multiple-failure regions, permitting to both building an accurate metamodel and to provide a statistically consistent error. Indeed, an importance sampling technique is used, which is quasi-optimal since permits, by exploiting the knowledge of the metamodel, to provide two unbiased estimators of the failure probability. Additionally, a gaussian mixture-based importance sampling technique is proposed, permitting to drastically reduce the computational cost when estimating some reference values, or the failure probability directly from the metamodel.
   Several numerical examples are carried out, showing the very good performances of the proposed method with respect to the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and computational cost. A physical test-case, focused on the numerical simulation of non-ideal gas turbine cascades, is also investigated to illustrate the capabilities of the method on an industrial case.

AB This paper considers spectral-finite difference methods of a high-order of accuracy for solving the one-way wave equation using the Laguerre integral transform with respect to time as the base. In order to provide a high spatial accuracy and stability, the Richardson method can be employed. However such an approach requires high computer costs, therefore we consider alternative algorithms based on the Adams multistep schemes. To reach the stability for the one-way equation, the stabilizing procedures using the spline interpolation were developed. This made it possible to efficiently implement a predictor-corrector type method thus decreasing computer costs. The stability and accuracy of the procedures proposed have been studied, based on the implementation of the migration algorithm within a problem of seismic prospecting. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB A computational framework based on nonlinear direct-adjoint looping is presented for optimizing mixing strategies for binary fluid systems. The governing equations are the nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations, augmented by an evolution equation for a passive scalar, which are solved by a spectral Fourier-based method. The stirrers are embedded in the computational domain by a Brinkman-penalization technique, and shape and path gradients for the stirrers are computed from the adjoint solution. Four cases of increasing complexity are considered, which demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the computational approach and algorithm. Significant improvements in mixing efficiency, within the externally imposed bounds, are achieved in all cases. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The identification of parameters in mathematical models using noisy observations is a common task in uncertainty quantification. We employ the framework of Bayesian inversion: we combine monitoring and observational data with prior information to estimate the posterior distribution of a parameter. Specifically, we are interested in the distribution of a diffusion coefficient of an elliptic PDE. In this setting, the sample space is high-dimensional, and each sample of the PDE solution is expensive. To address these issues we propose and analyse a novel Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler for the approximation of the posterior distribution. Classical, single-level SMC constructs a sequence of measures, starting with the prior distribution, and finishing with the posterior distribution. The intermediate measures arise from a tempering of the likelihood, or, equivalently, a resealing of the noise. The resolution of the PDE discretisation is fixed. In contrast, our estimator employs a hierarchy of PDE discretisations to decrease the computational cost. We construct a sequence of intermediate measures by decreasing the temperature or by increasing the discretisation level at the same time. This idea builds on and generalises the multi-resolution sampler proposed in P.S. Koutsourelakis (2009) [33] where a bridging scheme is used to transfer samples from coarse to fine discretisation levels. Importantly, our choice between tempering and bridging is fully adaptive. We present numerical experiments in 2D space, comparing our estimator to single-level SMC and the multi-resolution sampler. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We revisit the generation of balanced octrees for adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) of Cartesian domains with immersed complex geometries. In a recent short note (Hasbestan and Senocak, 2017) [42], we showed that the data locality of the Z-order curve in a hashed linear-octree generation method may not be perfect because of potential collisions in the hash table. Building on that observation, we propose a binarized-octree generation method that complies with the Z-order curve exactly. Similar to a hashed linear-octree generation method, we use Morton encoding to index the nodes of an octree, but use a red-black tree in place of the hash table. Red-black tree is a special kind of a binary tree, which we use for insertion and deletion of elements during mesh adaptation. By strictly working with the bitwise representation of an octree, we remove computer hardware limitations on the depth of adaptation on a single processor. Additionally, we introduce a geometry encoding technique for rapidly tagging a solid geometry for mesh refinement. Our results for several geometries with different levels of adaptations show that the binarized-octree generation method outperforms the linear-octree generation method in terms of runtime performance at the expense of only a slight increase in memory usage. The current AMR capability, reb1-AMR, is available as open-source software. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Modeling of thermal multiphase fluid flow in subsurface porous media poses significant difficulties for nonlinear solvers. These difficulties are a result of the strong coupling between the mass and energy conservation equations through the thermodynamic relationships. In particular, for geothermal problems, this tight coupling results in an apparent "negative compressibility" for cells (control volumes) that have two fluid phases (liquid and vapor) during the time interval of interest. This behavior is associated with the flow of cold water into a cell that is at saturated conditions. As steam condensation occurs, the reduction in fluid volume due to the phase change is larger than the expansion of the liquid and vapor due to injection. As a result, the cell pressure decreases as condensation proceeds. This pressure decrease leads to an increase in the inflow of cold water until the condensation is complete. During the condensation period, the overall compressibility of the system is negative, and this poses serious convergence problems even when a fully implicit (i.e., backward Euler) time discretization is used. In order to deal with this problem, nonlinear solvers must be modified. In this work, we present a nonlinear solution strategy that overcomes the negative compressibility associated with the condensation front. We first consider a single-cell problem that demonstrates the negative compressibility phenomenon. Then, we describe a solution strategy that overcomes the nonlinear convergence difficulties. We then derive a criterion that can be used as a nonlinear preconditioning strategy to solve multicell problems. The effectiveness of the proposed nonlinear solution scheme is then demonstrated for more complex models. It was found that for one-dimensional problems, this nonlinear solution strategy converges for all timesteps sizes, while the fully coupled strategy only converges for a limited sized timestep. Furthermore, for a two-dimensional heterogeneous problem, the largest Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number for this method is at least an order of magnitude larger than the CFL number that can be used with the fully coupled approach.

AB Reconstructing the interface within a cell, based on volume fraction and normal direction, is a key part of multiphase flow solvers which make use of piecewise linear interface calculation (PLIC) such as the Coupled Level Set Volume of Fluid (CLSVOF) method. In this paper, we present an iterative method for interface reconstruction (IR) in general convex cells based on tetrahedral decomposition. By splitting the cell into tetrahedra prior to IR the volume of the truncated polyhedron can be calculated much more rapidly than using existing clipping and capping methods. In addition the root finding algorithm is designed to take advantage of the nature of the relationship between volume fraction and interface position by using a combination of Newton's and Muller's methods. In stand-alone tests of the IR algorithm on single cells with up to 20 vertices the proposed method was found to be 2 times faster than an implementation of an existing analytical method, while being easy to implement. It was also found to be 3.4-11.8 times faster than existing iterative methods using clipping and capping and combined with Brent's root finding method. Tests were then carried out of the IR method as part of a CLSVOF solver. For a sphere deformed by a prescribed velocity field the proposed method was found to be up to 33% faster than existing iterative methods. For simulations including the solution of the velocity field the maximum speed up was found to be approximately 52% for a case where 12% of cells lie on the interface. Analysis of the full simulation CPU time budget also indicates that while the proposed method has produced a considerable speed-up, further gains due to increasing the efficiency of the IR method are likely to be small as the IR step now represents only a small proportion of the run time.

AB Numerical discretizations of the Generalized Porous Medium Equation (GPME) with discontinuous coefficients are analyzed with respect to the formation of numerical artifacts. In addition to the degeneracy and self-sharpening of the GPME with continuous coefficients, detailed in [1], increased numerical challenges occur in the discontinuous coefficients case. These numerical challenges manifest themselves in spurious temporal oscillations in second order finite volume discretizations with both arithmetic and harmonic averaging. The integral average, developed in [2], leads to improved solutions with monotone and reduced amplitude temporal oscillations. In this paper, we propose a new method called the Shock-Based Averaging Method (SAM) that incorporates the shock position into the numerical scheme. The shock position is numerically calculated by discretizing the theoretical speed of the front from the GPME theory. The speed satisfies the jump condition for integral conservation laws. SAM results in a non-oscillatory temporal profile, producing physically valid numerical results. We use SAM to demonstrate that the choice of averaging alone is not the cause of the oscillations, and that the shock position must be a part of the numerical scheme to avoid the artifacts.

AB For practical model-based demands, such as design space exploration and uncertainty quantification (UQ), a high-fidelity model that produces accurate outputs often has high computational cost, while a low-fidelity model with less accurate outputs has low computational cost. It is often possible to construct a bi-fidelity model having accuracy comparable with the high-fidelity model and computational cost comparable with the low-fidelity model. This work presents the construction and analysis of a non-intrusive (i.e., sample-based) bi-fidelity model that relies on the low-rank structure of the map between model parameters/uncertain inputs and the solution of interest, if exists. Specifically, we derive a novel, pragmatic estimate for the error committed by this bi-fidelity model. We show that this error bound can be used to determine if a given pair of low- and high-fidelity models will lead to an accurate bi-fidelity approximation. The cost of this error bound is relatively small and depends on the solution rank. The value of this error estimate is demonstrated using two example problems in the context of UQ, involving linear and non-linear partial differential equations. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB An explicit moving boundary method for the numerical solution of time-dependent hyperbolic conservation laws on grids produced by the intersection of complex geometries with a regular Cartesian grid is presented. As it employs directional operator splitting, implementation of the scheme is rather straightforward. Extending the method for static walls from Klein et al. (2009) [37], the scheme calculates fluxes needed for a conservative update of the near-wall cut-cells as linear combinations of "standard fluxes" from a one-dimensional extended stencil. Here the standard fluxes are those obtained without regard to the small sub-cell problem, and the linear combination weights involve detailed information regarding the cut-cell geometry. This linear combination of standard fluxes stabilizes the updates such that the time-step yielding marginal stability for arbitrarily small cut-cells is of the same order as that for regular cells. Moreover, it renders the approach compatible with a wide range of existing numerical flux-approximation methods. The scheme is extended here to time dependent rigid boundaries by reformulating the linear combination weights of the stabilizing flux stencil to account for the time dependence of cut-cell volume and interface area fractions. The two-dimensional tests discussed include advection in a channel oriented at an oblique angle to the Cartesian computational mesh, cylinders with circular and triangular cross-section passing through a stationary shock wave, a piston moving through an open-ended shock tube, and the flow around an oscillating NACA 0012 aerofoil profile.

AB Some LiAlSi3O8-based glass-ceramics with various contents of zirconia additions (0-4 wt%) were synthesized via solid state reaction. The influences of zirconia content on the microstructure, bulk densities, phase composition, coefficient of thermal expansion, bending strength and dielectric properties of the samples were discussed. The two crystals of LiAlSi3O8 and MgSiO3 can be found in all the samples, and the third phase of ZrSiO4 was identified only in the samples with zirconia content of 2 wt% and 4 wt%. In addition, the zirconia addition is beneficial to the sintering densification, as well as the improvement of bending strength and dielectric properties. The theoretical coefficient of thermal expansion of glass-ceramics calculated by a unique model was close to the experimental data. This shows that the model is helpful to predict the coefficient of thermal expansion of the LiAlSi3O8-based glass-ceramics. Crystallization kinetics of the LiAlSi3O8-based glass-ceramics was studied in the framework of the Kissinger, Ozawa and Augis-Bennett models. And the activation energy and Avrami index were determined by using differential scanning calorimetry. The results showed that the increase of zirconia content reduced the activation energy and changed the crystallization mechanism. The sample with 4 wt% zirconia sintered at 875 degrees C exhibited excellent properties, indicating that it is a potential candidate for low temperature substrate materials.

AB The exploration of Fe doping on crystallization behavior of Ni-Mn-Sn alloy thin films is crucial for its application, but remains unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of Fe doping on the crystallization kinetics of Ni-Mn-Sn free-standing alloy thin films by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in the mode of non-isothermal and isothermal conditions. In the case of non-isothermal crystallization, it is found that the crystallization peak temperatures of Ni50-xMn39Sn11Fex (x = 0, 0.5, 2, 4) free-standing alloy thin films increase with increasing Fe content. The apparent activation energy from the amorphous state to crystallization which determined by Kissinger's method increase with increasing Fe content. The local activation energy is determined by Doyle method. In the case of isothermal crystallization, the crystallization kinetics was modeled by the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami equation. The Avrami exponents were calculated to be in the range of 1 to 1.5. The local Avrami exponents indicating that the crystallization mechanism of Ni50-xMn39Sn11Fex (x = 0, 0.5, 2, 4) freestanding thin films is all from diffusion-controlled one-dimensional growth to diffusion-controlled two-dimensional and three-dimensional growth.

AB The structure of WO3-TeO2 glasses containing 15, 20 and 25 mol% WO3 are studied by neutron diffraction (ND), high energy X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray Absorption Near Edge spectroscopy (XANES). The short-range structural properties of glasses i.e. Te-O and W-O speciation, coordination number distributions, bond-lengths, and the O-Te-O, O-W-O and O-O-O bond angle distributions in the glass network are determined by the Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) simulations of the ND and XRD data. RMC technique successfully determined all partial pair correlation functions and the coordination number distributions revealed that glass network consists predominantly of TeO4 and WO4 units with small amounts of triangular, penta and hexa co-ordinated units. The average W-O and Te-O bond lengths are in the ranges: 1.69-1.75 +/- 0.01 angstrom and 1.99-2.00 +/- 0.01 angstrom respectively. Both W-O and Te-O correlation peaks are asymmetrical, that indicate a distribution of their bond lengths in the respective structural units. The O-Te-O bond angle distribution has a peak at 107 +/- 2 degrees. Similarly the O-W-O bond angle distribution has a peak at 108 +/- 5 degrees. On increasing the WO3 concentration from 15 to 25 mol%, the average Te-O coordination number decreases from 3.80 to 3.61 +/- 0.02 due to the structural transformation: TeO4 -> TeO3, similarly the W-O coordination also decreases and is in the range: 3.79-3.67 +/- 0.02. XANES studies found that the oxidation state of Te and W ions in the glasses are 4(+) and 6(+) respectively.

AB Er3+-ions doped lithium-bismuth-boro-phosphate glass samples were prepared by conventional melt quenching method and their structural, thermal, fluorescence, and decay times of the glasses were investigated. Prepared glass samples exhibits amorphous nature and shows very good thermal stability in the temperature range of RT to 500 degrees C. Judd-Ofelt (JO) analysis was carried out to obtain the parameters which will evidence the glass system for fibre and lasing applications. The intensity parameters Omega(lambda(2,4 and 6)) and stimulated-emission cross-sections were estimated for present glass system. The magnitude of Omega(2) confirms the covalency nature and compared with available other host. The near infrared emission spectra were measured by 980 nm excitation in which the emission intensity is found to be at 1532 nm for the I-4(11/2)-I-4(15/2) transition. The FWHM (78 nm), sigma(lambda(p)) (10.11 x 10(-21) cm(2)), Delta G (7.93 x 10(-28) cm(3)) and G (9.1 x 10(-24) cm(2) s), for I-4(11/2)-I-4(15/2) transition of present glasses are compared to some of the glass systems. Furthermore, the time decay rate found to be slight decreased from 1.04 ms to 0.90 ms when the concentration increased from 0.1 to 0.5 mol% of Er3+ ions and also all follow the single exponential behaviour which is attributed to the self-quenching effect due to the cross-relaxation channels. McCumber's theory reveals peak emission cross-section value is also good agreement with sigma(lambda(p)) which is 10.11 x 10(-21) cm(2). The obtained gain coefficient population inversion 40% with broad band of emission proves to consider the present system for C band amplifiers. The up conversion of luminescence spectra upon 980 nm excitation exhibits red emission at 665 nm due to F-4(9/2) - I-4(15/2) transitions also two photon absorption was obtained for power dependence up conversion.

AB A series of glass nanocomposite systems of the composition xAgI-(1 - x) (0.5Ag(2)O-0.5P(2)O(5)) for x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 have been prepared by conventional melt quenching route. The X-ray diffraction patterns indicate the amorphous nature of all the glassy samples with the presence of a certain amount of crystallinity, superposing over broad peaks. Different types of bonds, existing within present system have been identified by FT-IR measurement. The dc and ac conductivity decreases with AgI content. The values of activation energy for dc conductivity and activation energy for crossover frequency are very close to each other, which specify that the same mechanism is responsible for the electrical conduction. The ionic conduction depends on the Ag-ion-Ag-ion separation (R), which increases with a rise in AgI content. The absence of grain boundary effect is observed from complex impedance plots. The formation of the cation-electron pair with increasing AgI content is expected to block the diffusive or hopping path, which indicates fall in conductivity. Correlated barrier hopping (CBH) model is the appropriate mechanism for ac conduction process. The temperature and composition scaling of conductivity spectra reveals that the conductivity relaxation is independent of temperature but depend on composition i.e., the structure of the glass nanocomposites.

The structural units show the presence of BO3, and BO4 units while samarium ions favored to link with OH group. Density and molar volume show the impact of the replacement sodium ions by lithium. The density values increase with increasing lithium content up to 20 mol% and decrease for free sodium borate glass (30 Li2O or 0 Na2O). Optical and photoluminescence investigations were carried to determine the optical parameters such as optical band gap, refractive index, etc. The optical band gap and refractive index values show the nonlinearity trend due to the change occurred at 10% Li2O content. The non-linear optical parameters were determined and studied in terms of the refractive index and the impact of the mixed alkali effect.

AB Single phase multiferroic BiFeO3 nanocrystals and BiFeO3 doped magneto optical BiFeO3-PbO-Bi2O3-B2O3 glasses have been synthesized and characterized in this study. Through the X-ray diffraction, Scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, UV-Vis optical absorption, Vicker's hardness and Verdet constant measurement, the glass structure and spectral were found to be modified by BiFeO3 nanocrystal, and Faraday rotation, absorption edge and mechanical performance of glasses were improved by such modification due to the low band gap, high polarization, ferromagnetic & superparamagnetic property of nanocrystal BiFeO3. Glass of 5%BiFeO3-40%PbO-50%Bi2O3-5%B2O3 exhibits a Verdet constant of 0.1615 min/G-cm at 633 nm, thermal stability of 105 degrees C and a 510 nm cutoff wavelength which is very attractive to magneto optical glass devices.

AB Dy3+ doped Zinc Lead Tungsten Tellurite (ZnPbWTe) glasses have been synthesized by conventional melt quench method and their luminescence behavior was analyzed using optical absorption, excitation, photoluminescence (PL) and PL decay spectral studies. The Judd-Ofelt (J-O) intensity parameters evaluated from the absorption spectra are used to determine various radiative parameters such as transition probability (A(R)), branching ratio (beta(R)) and radiative lifetimes (tau(R)) for the prominent emission transitions of Dy3+ ions in ZnPbWTe glasses. Under 384 nm excitation, PL spectra recorded for the titled glasses, exhibit two intense peaks; one in yellow at 575 nm and the other one in blue at 483 nm region. Among these two, yellow band (F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2)) is relatively more intense than the blue one (4(4)F(9/2) -> H-6(15/2)). The intensity of PL spectra increases up to 1 mol% of Dy3+ ions in ZnPbWTe glasses and beyond concentration quenching is observed. Branching ratios (beta(R)) and emission cross-sections (sigma(se)) were estimated for F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2) transition to understand the potential utility of these glasses for laser action in visible region. The CIE chromaticity coordinates, color correlated temperature (CCT), color purity and Y/B ratios were also estimated to understand the suitability of these glasses for w-LEDs. The luminescence quantum efficiency evaluated for the titled glasses showing highest value for 1 mol% of Dy3+ ions present in the as prepared glasses. From the measured emission cross-sections, quantum efficiency and CIE coordinates, it was observed that 1 mol% of Dy3+ ions in ZnPbWTe glasses are aptly suitable for optoelectronic devices such as lasers and w-LEDs.

AB A number of recent studies in the literature have reported the existence of unusual temperature dependence of the shear viscosity for a variety of glass-forming liquids that cannot be described with a single fragility index. Rather, these liquids display an apparent fragile-to-strong transition (FST) with lowering of temperature that was suggested to be indicative of a structural transition. In the present work we critique the accuracy of the high temperature oscillation viscometry technique that was used almost exclusively for viscosity measurements of these liquids above their liquidus temperature. Viscosity measurements are carried out on binary Ge-Se chalcogenide liquids in their supercooled and stable states using conventional capillary and parallel-plate rheometry techniques and are compared with the oscillation viscometry data in the literature. Such comparisons conclusively demonstrate that the latter measurement technique often underestimates the viscosity by nearly an order of magnitude, especially at high temperatures. These results, when taken together, indicate that the observation of FST in glass-forming liquids is likely an artifact of the inaccuracy of the oscillation viscometry technique. Moreover, these results cast serious doubt on the reliability of the high-temperature oscillation viscometry data for metals and alloys that are prevalent in the literature.

AB Mathematical models for the chemical durability-composition relation for 5-component iron phosphate glasses, containing a nuclear waste similar to that of the high sulfate (similar to 17 wt%), high soda (similar to 80 wt%) Hanford AZ 102 LAW, have been developed using statistical analysis. The dissolution rate (DR) in deionized water at 90 degrees C was used as a representative property for the chemical durability. These waste forms contained P2O5, Fe2O3, Na2O and SO3. This 5-component system was used previously to develop mathematical models for predicting the dependence of glass formation on composition. The results from this study can potentially be used to develop other properties-compositions models for iron phosphate glasses containing nuclear wastes.
   Two separate statistical models, based on Backward Elimination and Stepwise procedures, were developed and both models produced similar results. The DR-values calculated from both models were in good agreement with the experimentally measured values. The DR-composition models developed for the present iron phosphate glass waste forms (containing Hanford AZ102 LAW), are shown to be valid for predicting DR-values for similar waste forms containing other types of nuclear wastes as well. The chemical durability for a few selected glasses whose compositions were generated by the models was also measured by the Vapor Hydration Test (VHT). The model predicted DR-values qualitatively confirmed the measured VHT-values, which provides further support for validating the model.

AB In this paper, we analyze the motives and barriers of researchers to engage in standardization in comparison with publishing and patenting. We conduct a survey on 129 researchers at the Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing, one of Germany's largest federal research institutes. The resultant dataset enables us to study not only the researchers' motives and barriers but also the effect of those motives and barriers on the extent to which the respective activities are undertaken. We find that publishing constitutes a baseline activity. By contrast, patenting is driven by commercialization motives, and standardization is mainly fostered by intrinsic motivation. With respect to the barriers, we find that they are mostly inherent to the activity itself or the system in which it is performed. Finally, we discuss several options to develop a more integrative incentive system to exploit the possible synergies between standardization and publishing and patenting.

AB This paper contributes to the ongoing debate on the reliability of published research. In particular, this study focuses on the selective reporting of research findings in clinical trials, defined as the publication of only part of the findings originally recorded during a research study, on the basis of the results. Selective reporting can lead to concerns ranging from publishing flawed scientific knowledge, to skewing medical evidence, to wasting time and resources invested in the conduct of research. Drawing upon a unique hand-collected dataset, this study investigates the contextual factors associated with selective reporting. Using 'risk of bias' ratings assessed based on expert judgment and presented in systematic reviews of clinical literature, this study explores whether selective reporting is associated with: (1) the source of institutional support, and, (2) the type of innovation evaluated. The results indicate that the odds of selective reporting are higher for industry-funded studies than for publicly funded studies; however, this effect is restricted to studies where at least one author is industry-affiliated. In addition, the results suggest that selective reporting is more likely in projects exploring radical innovation, compared to those investigating incremental innovation.

AB Technological innovations often involve collaboration among firms from diverse industries. Existing literature has largely viewed participant diversity as a conduit for non-redundant information or complementary resources, thereby affecting the ex-post outcomes of innovation projects. However, it is seldom examined how projects are initially evaluated during the resource competition stage. In this study, we develop a theory of diversity as a cognitive primer, asking how collaborators from diverse backgrounds may affect external reviewers' ex-ante evaluation of potential merits of an innovation project. We argue that there are two logics at work in the process of evaluating innovations: the logic of technological advancement and the logic of market value. When an innovation project involves firms from diverse industries, it may be perceived as having a fuzzier market identity, hence making it less appealing to reviewers who hold with the strong market value logic. However, the penalty associated with participant diversity should be less pronounced among reviewers who hold the technological advancement logic. We also expect the relationship between participant diversity and reviewers' ratings to be moderated by project novelty and fuzziness of technology category. We fmd support for our hypotheses with a sample of collaborative innovation projects funded by the Advanced Technology Program of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology.

AB We examine how the ways in which firms geographically configure their global portfolios of R&D units influence the effectiveness of firms' own R&D investments and of external technical knowledge in enhancing firm performance. Our analysis indicates that the strength of these effects depends on the extent to which firms spread their R&D units across countries (geographic dispersion of R&D) and the extent to which firms establish multiple R&D units within each country (co-location of R&D). We show that geographic dispersion and co-location are associated with distinct value creation and value capture mechanisms and in turn lead to different performance outcomes. Although geographic dispersion enhances the effects of a firm's own R&D on its performance, R&D co-location limits such effects. These relationships are reversed when we consider the effects of external technical knowledge on firm performance. R&D co-location, rather than geographic dispersion, is what renders the exploitation of external knowledge more effective in enhancing firm performance. Our results suggest that future research should shift its focus from the degree of R&D globalization to how a portfolio is globalized and geographically structured.

AB We evaluate the impact of the EC's Seventh Framework Programme, a large-scale research subsidy programme, on the innovation activities of subsidized firms, with a particular regard to industry university partnerships. Using matching and difference-in-difference estimation, we find a positive effect on a range of innovation indicators. The number of project participants in general and university participants in particular positively affect performance, suggesting knowledge spillovers between project members. Research centres, on the other hand, do not exert positive externalities. We also find that the benefits of collaborating with universities are amplified by their academic quality.

AB This paper identifies and evaluates the explicit and implicit philosophical assumptions underlying the so-called multilevel perspective on sociotechnical transitions (MLP). These include assumptions about the nature of reality (ontology), the status of claims about that reality (epistemology) and the appropriate choice of research methods The paper assesses the consistency of these assumptions with the philosophical tradition of critical realism and uses this tradition to highlight a number of potential weaknesses of the MLP. These include: the problematic conception of social structure and the misleading priority given to intangible rules; the tendency to use theory as a heuristic device rather than causal explanation; the ambition to develop an extremely versatile framework rather than testing competing explanations; the relative neglect of the necessity or contingency of particular causal mechanisms; and the reliance upon single, historical case studies with insufficient use of comparative methods. However, the paper also concludes that the flexibility of the MLP allows room for reconciliation, and provides some suggestions on how that could be achieved including proposing an alternative, critical realist interpretation of sociotechnical systems.

AB Using unique innovation survey data collected from a homogenous sample of firms in Pakistan, this paper presents an analysis of the firm level determinants of product innovation and its impact on firm performance. We employ a multi-stage structural model linking the decision of a firm to innovate, its innovation investment, product innovation, and firm performance using primary data from the textile and wearing apparel sector, which is the largest export sector of Pakistan. We find that product innovation leads to increased labor productivity as well as higher labor productivity growth. A 10 percent increase in innovative sales per worker is associated with a greater than 10 percent increase in labor productivity and labor productivity growth. On the determinants of innovation, we find that vertical knowledge flows from foreign clients and suppliers are important determinants of a firm's decision to innovate. Larger firms are more likely to engage in innovation, however, there is no significant evidence that they invest more in innovation. Exporting is positively associated with innovation performance and firms exporting to Europe and America are more likely to engage in innovation. There is mixed evidence on the impact of competition: foreign competition adversely affects a firm's decision to innovate, whereas, local competition increases investment in innovation. Subsidies seem to have a crowding out effect since firms receiving national subsides invest less in innovation. Furthermore, firms that have higher investment in innovation, that are more productive, and that introduce organizational innovations have higher innovative sales per worker.

AB Public Research Institutes (PRIs) were established for many reasons, such as to promote defence related research and health related research. Helping domestic industries remains one of the important missions for public research institutes even when the countries have industrialized and firms' technological capabilities are high. PRIs aim to upgrade existing industries, especially SMEs, as well as spearheading new ones. They can conduct research to solve today's problems of existing industries and those of next generation technologies which might lead to creation of new industries. Moreover, relationship between PRIs and firms and non-firm actors like universities became more intense, open, horizontal, international, and longer term. To reduce risk and uncertainty inherent in research mentioned above, intermediary roles of PRIs are increasingly important. The emphasis and the ways PRIs help industry change over time and vary across countries as they are integral part of national innovation systems. This makes generalization difficult, but the experiences of five leading PRIs in Germany, Taiwan, Japan, Australia, and the US shows that, the balances between contract research vs. longer term research with own initiative, mobility of researchers vs. retaining core researchers, and competitive grants and funds from industry vs. block grants from government are important to keep PRIs relevant to industry needs and maintain research standards. The governance of PRIs is of particular importance to maintain proper balances.

AB This article discusses the importance of boundary spanning innovation, demonstrates the drawbacks of popular metadata based boundary spanning measures, and proposes a new full text semantic similarity measure of boundary spanning. It subsequently uses the semantic distance boundary spanning measure to demonstrate that boundary spanning innovation has become more common in recent decades, and show that these boundary spanning inventions pose challenges for the traditional specialized-examiner patent examination model. Examining the applications for inventions that span technical boundaries takes longer and requires more back and-forth with the patent office than their comparatively simple peers. Finally, this article discusses potential reforms to the patent examination system to help address these challenges.

AB In this paper I attempt to measure the ability of a Norwegian publicly subsidized loan program to identify innovative firms that are victims of market imperfections. I apply three complementary control groups, which all have in common that they address specific unobservable characteristics of the program participants. The program participants perform better on a variety of growth measures compared to the firms rejected by the program. Compared with firms that receive private credit financing, I do not find that the program participants perform better in the upper quantiles of the contingent performance distribution despite a lower survival rate. The latter result suggests that the program does not seem to succeed in identifying a target group of firms with a sufficiently high growth potential. Firms with innovation loans are not outperformed by venture portfolio companies with respect to sales growth. The venture portfolio companies do, however, have higher survival rates as well as stronger growth in employment and assets. The latter result possibly indicates that the venture portfolio companies are more likely to succeed in the long run. The overall results indicate that the selection competency of the bureaucrats administrating the program is at level with that of private banks, and possibly also of that of venture funds. Still, in order for the program to provide the same level of welfare improvement as regular business credit provided by the private market, I find that the positive externalities from the program must be sufficiently large to compensate for the direct public subsidy element including risk adjusted return on equity and social costs of public funds.

AB The MgF2-x(OH)(x) with various aging times (1, 3, 6 and 12 h) have been obtained from sol-gel technique. The structure, chemical bonding and porosity of material were studied by X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectrofotometer and N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. The crystallinity and the number of OH groups of solids increase linearly with increasing of aging time. Moreover, the pore diameter and volume decrease from 4.79 to 2.82 nm and from 0.165 to 0.107 cm(3)/g, while the surface area increases from 137.84 to 150.55 m(2)/g with the increase in aging times, respectively. The catalytic activity of materials to yield biodiesel from Crude Palm Oil shows that the biodiesel yield decreases from 64.43 to 14.89, 12.17 and 10.49% with increasing aging times, respectively. The best performance of the catalyst depends on the greater values of pore size and volume as well as the lower crystallinity and the smaller number of OH groups. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Blast furnace slags are a by-product resulting from the production of pig iron that can be used as partial cement replacement materials. However, latent hydraulic properties and a low chemical activity of slags limit their wide application. Here, we demonstrate some methods for slag activation using electromagnetic vortex milling and alkaline activation. We show that slag powder with an average particle size of 8 mu m and a specific surface area of 2.4 m(2)/g is achieved at "slag/ferromagnetic elements" ratio of 1:2 and the processing time of 5 min in the electromagnetic vortex mill. The using of a 5 M sodium hydroxide solution stimulates the dissolution of the slag and results in the average 28-days compressive strength of a cement of 45.8-59.8 MPa. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

DE Micron Ag paste; Large-area interconnects; Roubust joints; Mechanism
ID NANOPARTICLES
AB Organics are difficult to be decomposed from large-area interconnects, i.e., more than 12 mm x 12 mm, using sintered Ag nanoparticles. This is mainly due to the lack of contact with air, which leads to insufficient sintering and low shear strength. In this paper, we report robust bonding of large-area interconnects by sintering of 1-2 mu m micron Ag paste. Organics could be removed rapidly from the large pores surrounded by coarse necks. At 250 degrees C, the content of residual organics in sintered silver joints with micron Ag paste was only 2.4%, which is 0.45 times lower than the one with nanoscale Ag paste. Roubus joints with high shear strength of 33.6 MPa were formed by coarse necks. The mechanism and morphological evolution of sintered silver joints with micron Ag paste were also studied. Interestingly, the cavities could be formed and enlarged inside the 1-2 mu m Ag micron-flakes due to the increase of tensile stress around the micron-flakes. This may be the main reason for the formation of coarse necks with robust bonding. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cyclic voltammetry measurements showed that the new chromophore C had a much smaller energy gap (Delta E = 1.25 eV) than chromophore A and B. UV-Vis absorption indicated that obvious red shift (more than 100 nm) obtained for chromophore C. The doped film C containing CF3-Ph-TCF chromophore showed a r(33) value of 235 pm/V at the concentration of 25 wt% which is much higher than that of the TCF based chromophore A (149 pm/V) and B (163 pm/V).

AB The uniform dispersed rod-shape superparamagnetic nanocomposite was prepared by the attachment of Fe3O4 particles onto attapulgite. These nanocomposites assemble into magnetically responsive liquid crystal with yellow Bragg reflections under an external magnetic field. The optical properties of the obtained liquid crystal can be controlled by the strength and the direction of the magnetic field as well as the concentration of attapulgite@Fe3O4. It was found that a maximum transmittance of light could be available with attapulgite@Fe3O4 concentration tuning from 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL when the magnet was fixed at a distance of 2 cm from the sample. We demonstrate the use of these nanocomposites to fabricate display and photonic devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Present study reported a simple and green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized via rapid bio-reduction method. An aqueous extract of Givotia moluccana (G. moluccana) plant was serving as reducing and stabilizing agent. An aqueous extract was found to comprise significantly high amounts of secondary metabolites like phenolics, flavonoids, proteins and reducing sugars etc., which are responsible for reducing and capping agents. The synthesized AgNPs were characterized by UV-Visible spectroscopy, FTIR, XRD, FESEM and HRTEM with SAED pattern. Particle size distribution was measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Further, thermal analysis of nanoparticles were studied using TGA. Synthesized AgNPs exhibited antimicrobial activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, a biodegradable Zn-0.5 wt%Zr alloy was treated by laser surface remelting, and its surface microstructure, microhardness and corrosion resistance were investigated. The results reveal that the Zn22Zr phase in the original Zn-Zr alloy was dissolved and fine dendrites were formed in the remelting zone. The microhardness of the remelting zone increased to about 100 HV0.025 from 40 similar to 50 HV0.025 of the original state. The LSR-treated surface shows much lower corrosion current and more positive corrosion potential than the original alloy, the simulated corrosion rate decreased obviously. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Cu@Al nano-materials were easily fabricated by immersing Al foil in related metal salt solutions. Although simple Cu@Al was a poor catalyst, after Fe and Cl doping, it became highly active in Suzuki coupling reactions of aryl iodides with aryl boric acids and led to very high product yields (up to 99%) with extremely high catalyst turnover numbers (TON up to 9.1 x 10(3) mol/mol). Fe/Cl doping affected the morphologies of the materials, endowing more active sites as well as facilitating better contact with the reaction substrates. This is the first report on cheap metal "tea bag" style catalyst, which can be easily removed, overcoming the interruptions by the generated insoluble by-products or tars during the reaction processes.

ID INSTABILITY; DEFORMATION
AB Shear band, a kind of unstable plasticity behavior, limits deformability of nanoscale materials, however the basic mechanism for such plasticity instability is still not understood well. Here, we found that the plastic deformation within the shear band of 25 nm-Cu/Au nanolayered composites is mainly contributed by the dislocation-dominated non-crystallographic rotation of the Cu/Au interface without destroying the crystallographic orientation. Homogeneous dislocation transmission across the transparent interface led to the non-crystallographic rotation to accommodate the geometrical requirement. The crystallographic relationship and structure in the interface zone can keep intact until the interface zone in the heavily-thinned layers becomes into amorphization. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Hydrogen is one of the most promising clean energy carriers within alternative fuels. The need for its absorption/release at reasonable p/T conditions within materials, like metallic Ti-Cr alloys, is primary for its use in renewable and sustainable energy applications.
   In this work TiCr1.78 compound was produced via selective laser melting (SLM) first time. Due to lack of commercially available powders of Ti-Cr compositions, two powders prototype precursors, premixed or prealloyed, were prepared and investigated. Correlation among powder type and microstructure of SLM built was studied. Prealloyed powders allowed Laves phases to be obtained in SLM parts while premixed did not fully react. Relative density of SLM products was strictly correlated to energy density. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE ZnO; Photocatalyst; Photocatalytic degradation; Organic azo dyes
AB The hexagon-like ZnO microstructure has been prepared at low temperature via hydrothermal method without using any surfactant, organic solvent or capping agent. ZnO belongs to hexagonal wurtzite structure. The formation of hexagon-like microstructure, with the grain size of about 480x720 nm (from SEM), is possibly due to assembling of many crystallites (crystallite size of 45-51 nm, from XRD). The blue emission over 420-500 nm may originate from the radiative combination due to surface defect states. ZnO showed high photodegradation efficiency of 95% after 80 min. The photodegradation reaction follows the pseudo first-order kinetics. ZnO photocatalyst retains its original efficiency (98%) even after the third cycle of reuse indicating the advantages of stability and reusability. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Semi-Supervised Growing Self Organizing Map (SSGSOM) is one of the best methods for online classification with partial labeled data. Many parameters can affect the performance of this method. The structure of GSOM network, activation degree and learning approach are the most important factors in SSGSOM. In this paper, a comprehensive robust mathematical formulation of the problem is proposed and then half quadratic (HQ) is used to solve it. Furthermore, an adaptive method is proposed to adjust activation degree optimally to improve the performance of SSGSOM. The results are reported on a variety of synthetic and UCI datasets and in the noisy conditions, which show superiority and robustness of the proposed method compared with the state of the art approaches.

AB As per the report of the World Health Organization (WHO), the mortalities due to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have increased to 50 million worldwide. Therefore, it is essential to have an efficient diagnosis of CVDs to enhance the healthcare in the clinical cardiovascular domain. The ECG signal analysis of a patient is a very popular tool to perform diagnosis of CVDs. However, due to the non-stationary nature of ECG signal and higher computational burden of the existing signal processing methods, the automated and efficient diagnosis remains a challenge.
   This paper presents a new feature extraction method using the sparse representation technique to efficiently represent the different ECG signals for efficient analysis. The sparse method decomposes an ECG signal into elementary waves using an overcomplete gabor dictionary. Four features such as time delay, frequency, width parameter, and square of expansion coefficient are extracted from each of the significant atoms of the dictionary. These features are concatenated and analyzed to determine the optimal length of discriminative feature vector representing each of the ECG signal. These extracted features representing the ECG signals are further classified using machine learning techniques such as least-square twin SVM, k-NN, PNN, and RBFNN. Further, the learning parameters of the classifiers are optimized using ABC and PSO techniques. The experiments are carried out for the proposed methods (i.e. feature extraction along with all classifiers) using benchmark MIT-BIH data and evaluated under category and personalized analysis schemes.
   Experimental results show that the proposed ECG signal representation using sparse decomposition technique with PSO optimized least-square twin SVM (best classifier model among k-NN, PNN and RBFNN) reported higher classification accuracy of 99.11% in category and 89.93% in personalized schemes respectively than the existing methods to the state-of-art diagnosis.

AB In the process of knowledge discovery in big data, sampling is a technological brick that can be included in a more general framework to speed up existing algorithms and contribute to the scalability issue. Two challenging and connected problems arise with complexity: tuning and timing. ProTraS(1) is a new algorithm that fulfills both requirements. It is driven by a unique parameter, the sampling cost. The cost is overestimated by the maximum within group distance and the group cardinality. It is an iterative algorithm, at each step a new representative is added, chosen as the farthest-first traversal item from the representative in the group with the highest probability of cost reduction. The novel algorithm is robust to noise and time optimized. A detailed comparison with alternative algorithms, conducted on various synthetic and real world data sets, shows that the proposal yields competitive results in terms of quality of representation for clustering, sampling size and sampling time.

This study highlights how the sequential implementation of SAX/GA and genetic operators works. This study is later used as the baseline for the development of parallel techniques capable of exploring the identified points of parallelism that simply focus on accelerating the heavy-duty fitness function to a full Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) accelerated GA.

DE Prefix tree; Nodesets; Bitmap representation; Frequent itemsets
ID PATTERNS
AB Frequent itemset mining is a basic data mining task and has numerous applications in other data mining tasks. In recent years, some data structures based on sets of nodes in a prefix tree have been presented. These data structures store essential information about frequent itemsets. In this paper, we propose another efficient data structure, NegNodeset. Similar to other such data structures, the basis of NegNodeset is sets of nodes in a prefix tree. NegNodeset employs a novel encoding model for nodes in a prefix tree based on the bitmap representation of sets. Based on the NegNodeset data structure, we propose negFIN, which is an efficient algorithm for frequent itemset mining. The efficiency of the negFIN algorithm is confirmed by the following three reasons: (1) the NegNodesets of itemsets are extracted using bitwise operators, (2) the complexity of calculating NegNodesets and counting supports is reduced to O(n), where n is the cardinality of NegNodeset, and (3) it employs a set-enumeration tree to generate frequent itemsets and uses a promotion method to prune the search space in this tree. Our extensive performance study on a variety of benchmark datasets indicates that negFIN is the fastest algorithm, compared with previous state-of-the-art algorithms. However, our algorithm runs with the same speed as dFIN on some datasets. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding accountability in contract violations, e.g., whom is accountable for what, is a tedious, time-consuming, and costly task for human decision-making, especially when contractual responsibilities are delegated among parties. Intelligent software agents equipped with expert capabilities such as monitoring and diagnosis help save time and improve accuracy of diagnosis by formal reasoning upon electronic contracts. Such contracts are represented as commitment norms, a well studied artifact in multi-agent systems, which provide semantics for agent interactions. Due to the open and heterogeneous nature of multi-agent systems, commitments are often violated. When a commitment is violated, e.g., an exception occurs, agents need to collaborate to understand what went wrong and which agent is responsible. We propose COMODO: a framework for monitoring commitment delegations and detecting violations. We define a complete set of possible rational delegation schemes for commitments, identifying for each combination of delegations what critical situations may lead to an improper delegation and potentially to a commitment violation. COMODO provides a sound and complete distributed reasoning procedure that is able to find all improper delegations of a given commitment. We provide the complete implementation of COMODO using the Reactive Event Calculus, and present an e-commerce case study to demonstrate its workings. Due to its generic nature, we discuss the application of our approach to other distributed diagnosis problems in emergency healthcare, Internet of Things and smart environments, and security, privacy, and accountability in the context of socio-technical systems.

AB Market prediction has been an important machine learning research topic in recent decades. A neglected issue in prediction is having a model that can simultaneously pay attention to the interaction of global markets along historical data of the target markets being predicted. As a solution, we present a hybrid supervised semi-supervised model called HyS3 for direction of movement prediction. The graph-based semi-supervised part of HyS3 models the markets global interactions through a network designed with a novel continuous Kruskal-based graph construction algorithm called ConKruG. The supervised part of the model injects results extracted from each market's historical data to the network whenever the hybrid model allows with an innovative conditional mechanism. The significance of higher prediction accuracy of HyS3 is comparing to other models is proved statistically against other models including supervised models and network-based semi-supervised predictions.

AB Classifier training plays an important role in image classification, while a good classifier could more effectively exploit the discriminative information of input features to separate the difficult samples. Inspired by the recent advance of representation based classifiers and the success of multi-layer architectures in visual recognition, we propose a multi-layer dictionary pair learning based classifier to enhance the image classification performance. With the multi-layer structure and a nonlinear feature transform in each layer, the proposed classifier learning model could accumulate stronger discrimination capability than the previous single-layer representation based classifiers. Furthermore, to make our learning model applicable to datasets with a larger amount of samples, we propose an online training algorithm which updates model parameters with data batches. The so-called online multi-layer dictionary pair learning (OMDPL) method is evaluated on benchmark image classification datasets. With the same input features, OMDPL exhibits better classification performance than other popular classifiers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Active classification systems developed by machine learning researchers have helped to recognize and retrieve object categories more rapidly. However, a large number of studies have focused on designing feedback procedures or sampling algorithms that maximize the information contained in individual examples for training the classifier, but it results in increasing time expense with the size of database. In this work, an attribute distance is proposed directly on visual attributes. And then, active classification systems are constructed on the chosen examples in a short time. Our contributions are reported as follows: (1) a small set of visual attributes can be discriminative for current classification tasks, and therefore, it can speed up the computation of example-to-hyperplane distances; (2) discriminative attributes are sequentially observed by using their scores given by the classifier, corresponding to target objects. We apply the attribute distance in several applications and show experimental results of speeding up feedback procedures. Moreover, the attribute distance can bring insight into designing a fast sampling strategy which is able to further improve the efficiency for existing classification systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB One of the main ingredients to learn a visual representation of an object using the Convolutional Neural Networks is a large and carefully annotated dataset. Acquiring a dataset in a demanded scale is not a straightforward task; therefore, the community attempts to solve this problem by creating noisy datasets gathered from web sources. In this paper, this issue is tackled by designing a vehicle recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks and noisy web data. In the proposed system, the transfer learning technique is employed, and behavior of several deep architectures trained on a noisy dataset are studied. In addition, the external noise of the gathered dataset is reduced by exploiting an unsupervised method called Isolation Forest, and the new training results are examined. Based on the experiments, high recognition accuracies were achieved by training two states of the art networks on the noisy dataset, and the obtained results were slightly improved by using the proposed noise reduction framework. Finally, a demonstration application is provided to show the capability and the performance of the proposed approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are low-level inflammation processes affected by several factors including diet. It has been reported that mixed whole grain and legume consumption, e.g. corn and common bean, might be a beneficial combination due to its content of bioactive compounds. A considerable amount would be retained in the non-digestible fraction (NDF), reaching the colon, where microbiota produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and phenolic compounds (PC) with known anti-inflammatory effect. The aim of this study was to estimate the anti-inflammatory potential of fermented-NDF of corn-bean chips (FNDFC) in RAW 264.7 macrophages. After 24 h, FNDFC produced SCFAs (0.156-0.222 mmol/l), inhibited nitric oxide production > 80% and H2O2 > 30%, up-regulated anti-inflammatory cytokines (I-TAC, TIMP-1) > 2-fold, and produced angiostatic and protective factors against vascular/tissue damage, and amelioration of tumor necrosis factor signalling and inflammatory bowel disease. These results confirm the anti-inflammatory potential derived from healthy corn-bean chips.

AB Egg proteins are a good source of bioactive peptides. Previous work from our research group has demonstrated the potential of egg white hydrolysate (EWH) for enhancing adipogenic differentiation and insulin signalling in 3T3-F442A pre-adipocytes. EWH was prepared by a combination of thermolysin and pepsin. Here, in this study, we aimed to identify the responsible peptide(s) in EWH. EWH was fractionated stepwise by ultrafiltration, C18 Sep-Pack cartridge, cation-exchange chromatography, and reverse-phase chromatography. The two most active fractions were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and 42 peptides were identified. Eleven peptides were synthesized and WEKAFKDED, QAMPFRVTEQE, ERYPIL, and VFKGL from ovalbumin were validated with peroxisome pro-liferator-associated receptor gamma stimulatory activity in adipocytes. For the first time, adipogenic differentiating peptides were characterized from egg white proteins. This data is pivotal for future structure-function studies of adipogenic peptides.

AB Chemical composition and stability parameters of three cold-pressed nut oils (almond, walnut and pistachio) were monitored for up to 16 months of storage at 5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 20 degrees C and room temperature. Freshly pressed pistachio oil had lower peroxide value than almond oil and higher induction period than almond and walnut oils, indicating a higher stability. The peroxide values increased faster at room temperature than at lower temperatures during the storage time, and the highest increase was for pistachio oil stored at room temperature exposed to daylight. The induction period decreased for all three nut oils during the storage time, regardless of the storage conditions. Pistachio oil remained the most stable oil at the end of the storage time, followed by almond oil. The percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased slightly throughout the storage.

AB Effect of high-humidity hot air impingement blanching on photochemical degradation kinetics (red pigments and ascorbic acid) and antioxidant capacity changes (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydracyl, DPPH and total antioxidant capacity) of red pepper during 6-month storage at ambient temperature in dark was investigated. Ultrastructure of raw and blanched samples was also observed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Blanching followed by drying resulted in 63-85% and 33-59% reduction in red pigment and ascorbic acid content, respectively. The antioxidant capacity of samples was found to increase after drying. After 6-month storage, further breakdown of red pigment and ascorbic acid was observed. The red pigment degradation followed the first-order reaction kinetics; untreated samples displayed the most red pigment loss, while the Weibull model described well the ascorbic acid degradation kinetics. Ultrastructure observations explained why over-blanching can cause serious phytochemical degradation. The current findings indicate proper blanching pretreatment prevents phytochemicals degradation of dried pepper during storage.

AB 3-Sulfanylhexan-1-ol (3SH) is an important contributor to the fruity notes of wine. 3SH exists as odorless precursors in grape and its release from the precursors is generally mediated by yeast during alcoholic fermentation. Here, the impact of lactic acid bacteria on 3SH production was investigated. Among the species tested, only Lactobacillus plantarum released 3SH from S-3-(hexan-1-ol)-L-cysteine (3SH-S-cys) and S-3-(hexan-1-ol)-L-cysteinylglycine (3SH-S-cysgly) in the whole-cell biotransformation assay. The conversion yields of 3SH from 3SH-S-cysgly by L. plantarum were always higher than those from 3SH-S-cys, suggesting that the direct cleavage of 3SH-S-cysgly to yield 3SH predominantly occurred. L. plantarum biotransformed the 3SH precursors, including 3SH-S-glut, to release 3SH in fermented grape juice. The results indicate that L. plantarum induces the release of 3SH from the 3SH precursors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing the impact of L. plantarum on thiol precursor biotransformation.

AB Screening carotenoids of elite accessions of yam (Dioscorea spp.) used in the global yam breeding program has been conducted to quantitatively determine the carotenoid composition of the crop. Comparisons to previous data reporting cerotenoid levels in yam has been made, in order to deduce greater perspectives across multiple studies. Characterisation of complex species and accession -specific profiles have shown a rich base of diversity that can inform breeding strategies. Key findings include; (i) the identification of accessions rich in beta-carotene which can aid provitamin A biofortification, (ii) Data disputing the commonly held belief that yellow Guinea yam (D. cayennensis) has higher beta-carotene content than that of white Guinea yam (D. rotundata), and (iii) the tentative identification of C-25-epoxy-apocarotenoid persicaxanthin with potential implications for tuber dormancy.

AB Phenolic ripening represents a major interest for quality wine producers. Nevertheless, climatic or genotypical limitations can often prevent optimal maturation process. During winemaking seeds can be easily separated and technologically processed to improve their quality. Relying on the key role of oxidation for phenolic ripening, a freeze-thaw treatment was proposed to improve the fruit quality for potential use in challenging growing conditions. The experiment was carried on in two distinctive viticultural areas, Michigan and Italy. Five cultivars (Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot noir and Chambourcin) and six cultivars (Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese, Syrah, Croatina, Barbera and Nebbiolo) were used in Michigan and Italy, respectively. Samples were collected at different phenological stages, to describe the natural ripening process and grape seeds were characterized before and after a freeze-thaw treatment. Colorimetric and spectrophotometric data highlighted similarities among natural and artificial seed ripening promising future applications for the wine industries.

AB Spherical aggregates can be obtained from taro starch by spray-drying without using bonding agents. Accurate information about thermal issues of spherical aggregates can provide valuable information for assessing the application as encapsulant. Spherical aggregates of taro starch were obtained by spray-drying and analyzed using dynamic vapour sorption. The use of the Guggenheim, Anderson and de Boer (GAB) model indicated a Type II isotherm pattern with weaker interactions in the multilayer region. Differential enthalpy and entropy estimates reflected a mesoporous microstructure, implying that energetic mechanisms dominate over transport mechanisms in the sorption process. The limitation by energetic mechanisms was corroborated with enthalpy-entropy compensation estimates. The diffusivity coefficient was of the order of 10(-8) m(2)center dot s(-1), which is in line with results obtained for common materials used for encapsulation purposes. The thermodynamic properties and the lack of a bonding agent indicated the viability of spherical aggregates of taro starch for encapsulation of bio-compounds.

AB Whole wheat cracker fortified with tuna bone bio-calcium (Bio-Ca) powder was developed as health-promoting food rich in calcium. Fortification with different levels of Bi-Ca, over the range of 0-50% of whole wheat flour (w/w) on quality and sensory properties of crackers, were determined. Color, thickness, weight and textural properties of crackers varied with the different levels of Bio-Ca powder added, but it was found that up to 30% could be added without detrimental effect on sensory properties. Scanning electron microscopic images showed that the developed crackers were less porous and had a denser structure, compared to the control. Based on scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (SEM-EDX), the cracker containing Bio-Ca powder had calcium and phosphorous distribution with higher intensity, compared to the control. The fortified crackers were rich in calcium and phosphorous with higher protein content but lower fat, carbohydrate, cholesterol and energy value, compared to the control.

AB This study extends previous work on Cabernet Sauvignon wines of lowered alcohol concentrations produced by pre-fermentatively substituting proportions of juice from an overripe crop with "green harvest wine" or water to adjust initial sugar concentrations. Resulting wines were assessed for their volatile compositions and sensory characteristics to evaluate the suitability of this winemaking approach to managing wine alcohol concentrations in warm viticulture regions. Wines from water or green harvest wine substitution were also compared to wines of similar alcohol content produced from earlier harvested grapes. Implementation of water substitution in particular resulted in minor alterations of wine volatile composition compared to the control, and positive aroma and flavour characteristics were preserved. However, overripe sensory attributes such as 'hotness' and 'port wine' were conserved whereas they were absent in wines of similar alcohol level made from earlier harvested grapes, thereby emphasising the relevance of grape (over) maturity when producing lower alcohol wines.

AB Two series of compounds showing mass signals at m/z 605 and 893 (negative ionization mode) have been detected in fermented cocoa beans. This study objective is to identify these mass signals and characterize their structure in fermented cocoa samples. Our hypothesis is that these signals may correspond to ethyl-bridged flavan-3-ols resulting from flavan-3-ol condensation with acetaldehyde which is a microbial metabolite. Mass spectrometry was used to compare the retention times and mass fragmentation patterns between a model solution using epicatechin and procyanidin dimer B2, the major flavan-3-ols of cocoa, as precursors and extracts of fermented cocoa. Their identification was confirmed: four isomers of ethyl-linked epicatechin as well as several isomers of epicatechin-ethyl-procyanidin B2, in which B2 was mostly linked through its upper unit, were characterized in cocoa. This study demonstrates the presence of flavan-3-ol acetaldehyde condensation products in fermented cocoa beans and provides the first report of epicatechin-ethyl-procyanidin B2.

AB An Electrochemical nonenzymatic sensor was fabricated based on cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), chitosan (Chit) and carbon nanotube (CNT) nanocomposite modified glassy carbon electrode. Scanning electron microscopy morphology showed that CNT well dispersed in Chit, while CTAB micelles assembled on the surface of the CNT. Due to the synergetic effect of the three components, excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of hydroxymethanesulfinate (HMS) in the presence of both fixed and varying concentrations of sulfite was achieved. An enhanced peak current and expanded peak-to-peak separation between HMS and sulfite was observed. Differential pulse voltammetry was applied to quantify HMS and the calibration curve was linear in the range of 30-800 mu M with a detection limit of 9.6 mu M. The method was applied in the determination of HMS in food samples collected from local markets, and the results have no remarkable difference with the reference HPLC method.

AB Cafestol and kahweol (C&K), two coffee diterpene alcohols with structural similarity which exhibit anticarcinogenic effects, were isolated from green coffee Arabica beans, followed by their lipase-catalysed esterification and purification by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The isolation and enzymatic synthesis parameters of C&K esters were studied, with the latter optimised by a Central Composite Design; both procedures were monitored by gas chromatography. Scale up and improved isolation conditions resulted in 1.29 g of C&K, with 98% purity from 300 g of green Arabica beans. The highest C&K ester yields were observed using an alcohol: fatty acid molar ratio of 1:5, 73.3 mg mL(-1) of CAL-B enzyme, 70 degrees C and 240 rpm for 3 days in toluene, leading to 85-88% conversion among a variety of tested C&K esters, including n-C-14:0-C-20:0, C-18:1, C-18:2 and C-18:3.

AB The fruit quality of 6 citrus cultivars growing in the same orchard was determined at ripening stage in both 2014 and 2015. We further measured the components of sugar (sucrose, fructose and glucose), organic acid (citric, malate and quinic acid), enzymes related to Glycolysis and Krebs cycle and mineral elements at 5 stages of fruit development in the second year. The results showed that at ripening stage of both years, 'Newhall' cultivar had higher TSS concentration and the TSS/TA ratio but lower TA concentration, while 'Flame' cultivar was exactly opposite. Sucrose and citric acid were the most accumulated compounds in fruit during the fruit development of 6 citrus cultivars. Fruit sucrose concentration increased from 9.26 mg.kg(-1) at 60 DAFB to 50.92 mg.kg(-1) at 180 DAFB, and the citric acid concentration increased from 1.41 mg.kg(-1) at 60 DAFB to 29.87 mg.kg(-1) at 90 DAFB or 29.02 mg.kg(-1) at 120 DAFB then decreased till ripening (5.47 mg.kg(-1)). We found ACO was the key enzyme resulting in the difference of citric acid accumulation, but not quite clear in sucrose metabolism. The fruit mineral nutrient concentrations of 6 cultivars during the fruit development were 0.94-1.92% of N, 0.11-0.23% of P, 1.03-1.37% of K, 0.31-1.15% of Ca, 0.11-0.29% of Mg, 3.97-72.34 mg.Fe kg(-1), 1.93-10.64 mg.Mn kg-1, 1.56-10.73 mg.Cu kg(-1), and 0.90-16.80 mg.Zn kg(-1). We also analyzed the relationship among each sugar, organic acid component and mineral nutrient in this study by curve estimation and PCA analysis. The results indicated that only Mg was significantly correlated with both sugar and organic acid component, negative and positive respectively. It suggested that the accumulation of sugar and organic acid might be related to the dynamic changes of fruit Mg concentrations of 6 citrus cultivars.

AB Steviol glycosides from Stevia rebaudiana leaves are used in stevia-based sweeteners for their intense sweetness and low calories. Rebaudioside D is present in leaves in minute quantities (similar to 0.4-0.5% w/w total dry weight), but it is similar to 350 times sweeter than sucrose, and sweeter than the more abundant rebaudioside A and stevioside. In the present study, pathways for rebaudioside D synthesis and UDP-glucose recycling were developed by coupling recombinant UDP-glucosyltransferase UGTSL2 from Solanum lycopersicum and sucrose synthase StSUS1 from Solanum tuberosum. Reaction parameters, including substrate ratio, sucrose concentration, temperature, crude extract concentration, and reaction time, were evaluated, and 17.4 g/l of rebaudioside D (yield = 74.6%) was obtained from 20 g/l of rebaudioside A after 20 h, using UDP or UDP-glucose in recombinant cell crude extracts. Extending the reaction time generated rebaudioside M2 from further glycosylation of rebaudioside D. K-m values for UGTSL2 indicated a higher affinity for rebaudioside D than for rebaudioside A.
