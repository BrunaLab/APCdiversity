AB OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association of different etiologies of cardioembolism (CE), intracranial arterial stenosis (ICAS), or the combination of these conditions with outcomes of mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke.
   METHODS: Data from the intervention group of the Endovascular therapy for Acute ischemic Stroke Trial (EAST) were analyzed. In 140 patients, the presence of CE, ICAS, neither CE nor ICAS, or both conditions was assessed. The primary outcome was a favorable outcome at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2); secondary outcomes included successful reperfusion (modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction grade 2b-3), symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and 90-day mortality.
   RESULTS: Of 140 patients, 47 had neither CE nor ICAS, 35 had ICAS but not CE, 46 had CE but not ICAS, and 12 had both CE and ICAS. The rate of favorable outcome was 67.1% in the no CE and no ICAS group, 74.3% in the ICAS without CE group, 41.3% in the CE without ICAS group, and 33.3% in the CE and ICAS group. The CE and ICAS group had poor outcomes (odds ratio =0.20 after adjusting for age, sex, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.95; P = 0.043). No significant differences were observed in secondary outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: The presence of both CE and ICAS was associated with poor outcome in patients with anterior circulation large-vessel occlusion treated with endovascular thrombectomy. Future studies are warranted to further explore this association.

AB OBJECTIVE: The present study was conducted to evaluate the levels of Cdk2, cyclin E, p21, and p27 in growth hormone adenomas (GHPAs) and analyze their association with clinicopathologic features.
   METHODS: We collected 46 GHPA specimens and clinical materials from March 2012 to December 2015 at Beijing Tiantan Hospital. We analyzed the expression of Cdk2, cyclin E, p21, and p27 using immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and sequencing.
   RESULTS: The levels of cyclin E and Cdk2 were much greater in the invasive group than in the noninvasive group (P < 0.05). Significant differences were found between cyclin E and p21 and tumor size (P < 0.05) and between cyclin E expression and invasion (P < 0.05). Tumors were more likely to require whole resection in patients with low cyclin E expression (P < 0.05). The high-level p27 group had better progression-free survival than did the low-level p27 group (P < 0.01). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis revealed a similar trend for Cdk2, cyclin E, p21, and p27 protein levels in growth hormone specimens (P < 0.01). An average of 33 CpG sites per sample were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass array, and in 7 of the 33 CpG sites, the methylation levels of p27 were > 50%. Statistically significant differences were found in 4 CpG sites between the invasive and noninvasive specimens (P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of cyclin E/Cdk2 and loss of p27 appears to be associated with a poor prognosis and might play a role in the treatment of GHPAs in the future.

AB OBJECTIVE: Vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia (VBD) is a rare cause of hemifacial spasm. The ectatic vessel hinders microscopic visualization of the root exit zone. The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefit of endoscopic visualization during microvascular decompression (MVD) in managing this type of neurovascular compression.
   METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of patients with VBD treated by endoscope-assisted MVD for hemifacial spasm between 2007 and 2016 was performed. A prospectively maintained database of all patients treated by MVD for hemifacial spasm was screened for vascular compression. Magnetic resonance imaging was evaluated to detect patients who had VBD according to defined criteria. The value of endoscopic inspection to detect offending vessels was analyzed, and clinical outcome was evaluated.
   RESULTS: VBD was detected in 11 of 290 patients (incidence 3.8%). In these patients, 12 MVD procedures were performed. The endoscope was useful in identifying the offending vessels and adjacent perforators without any brain retraction in all patients. At last clinical follow-up, all patients had almost complete to complete resolution of clinical symptoms. The interposing technique alone was effective with excellent results in 8 patients. Three patients required an additional transposition-fixation technique to achieve sufficient decompression.
   CONCLUSIONS: VBD is a rare cause of hemifacial spasm. Because of the large diameter of the offending vessel, MVD is technically more demanding. Endoscopic inspection with a 45 degrees endoscope enables accurate visualization of the root exit zone, offending vessels, and perforating arteries. Furthermore, accurate placement of the Teflon pledgets can be confirmed leading to a favorable outcome.

ID RANDOMIZED TRIAL; ENDARTERECTOMY; ANGIOPLASTY; COMPLICATIONS
AB OBJECTIVE: Carotid artery stenosis is frequently diagnosed through screening tests with noninvasive imaging. Because of differences noted between the various modalities, we sought to investigate our experience comparing noninvasive imaging (ultrasound, computed tomography angiography, magnetic resonance angiography) with invasive imaging (digital subtraction angiography).
   METHODS: In a multicenter retrospective analysis, 249 carotid vessels were reviewed based on angiography with the associated noninvasive imaging.
   RESULTS: Overall, medical or surgical decision management was changed in 43% (107/243) of cases investigated with digital subtraction angiography owing to a discrepancy between the measured percentage stenosis. In patients with potentially treatable carotid stenosis, angiography revealed nonsignificant stenosis 25.7% of the time.
   CONCLUSIONS: Angiography should be considered the confirmatory test for degree of stenosis in certain patients before definitive surgical treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: Contradictory results have been reported regarding the prognostic effect of ambulatory status in patients with metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC). The aim of this study was to investigate whether ambulatory status is a significant predictor of overall survival in patients with MSCC and to distinguish the differences of predictors between patients who were ambulatory and those who were not ambulatory before operation.
   METHODS: Three clinical centers were retrospectively reviewed to identify patients operated on for MSCC between 2005 and 2015. Fourteen prognostic factors were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, univariate log-rank test, and multivariate Cox hazard regression model for the whole cohort and the subgroups of ambulatory and nonambulatory patients.
   RESULTS: In all, 169 patients were consecutively enrolled. Their mean age was 59.6 +/- 10.5 years (range, 18-84 years). The median survival time in the whole cohort was 7.0 +/- 0.5 months, whereas it was 7.0 +/- 0.8 months and 5.0 +/- 1.3 months in ambulatory and nonambulatory patients, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that ambulatory status was not a significant predictor of overall survival (P = 0.266), but primary tumor type and Karnofsky performance status were independent predictors of overall survival for the whole cohort. Primary tumor and metastatic site were significantly associated with survival in ambulatory patients. Gender and Karnofsky performance status were associated with survival in nonambulatory patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ambulatory status was not shown to predict the prognosis of patients with MSCC. prognostic factors should be distinguished between ambulatory and nonambulatory patients when choosing a therapeutic modality.

AB BACKGROUND: Hypnosis is a technique that could aid awake surgery protocols. The aim of the present study is to describe the results of a preliminary experience of a cohort of patients operated on with an original protocol of hypnosis-aided awake surgery (HAS).
   METHODS: All patients were operated on with the aid of HAS and their data were retrospectively reviewed. A thorough literature review was conducted to compare the results of HAS with the standard awake surgery protocol regarding 1) the incidence of intraoperative pain; 2) the overall incidence of complications; 3) the length of time in which the patients were suitable for intraoperative neuropsychological testing; and 4) the incidence of gross total resection. The comparison presented a notably high statistical impact (1-beta - 0.90-0.93 for alpha - 0.05; effect size, 0.5).
   RESULTS: The final cohort comprised 6 patients from our institution and 43 records retrieved in the relevant literature underwent HAS for intrinsic brain tumor treatment. This cohort was compared with cohorts of patients who were considered eligible through a literature review. HAS showed a statistically significant superiority in the first 3 outcome variables, whereas the incidence of gross total resection favored the standard awake approaches.
   CONCLUSIONS: According to the results, hypnosisaided resection of intrinsic brain tumor located in eloquent areas is safe and effective, although dissociation phenomena deserve further investigation to be completely understood.

AB BACKGROUND: The intrapetrous carotid artery (IPCA) is one of the most unexplored anatomic regions, and its 3-dimensional reconstruction in living subjects is still missing. This study aims to describe the IPCA on 3D models extracted from head computed tomography (CT) scans.
   METHODS: The intrapetrous carotid artery was manually segmented on head CT scans of 100 healthy patients free from vascular and neurologic pathologies (50 men and 50 women; age range, 18-91 years). Angles of the posterior and anterior genu, diameter and length of the horizontal portion, and volume of the entire canal were calculated through 3D analysis software. Statistically significant differences according to sex and side were assessed through 2-way analysis of variance (P < 0.05). Correlation of each measurement with age was calculated as well.
   RESULTS: On average, the angles of the posterior and anterior genu were 120.1 degrees +/- 10.4 degrees and 118.0 degrees +/- 10.0 degrees in men and 119.5 degrees +/- 9.2 degrees and 117.6 degrees +/- 10.3 degrees in women, respectively, without statistically significant differences according to sex or side (P > 0.05). The average length and diameter of the horizontal part were, respectively, 25.5 degrees 2.9 and 5.8 +/- 0.8 mm in men and 24.0 +/- 2.3 and 5.3 +/- 0.8 mm in women. The volume of the IPCA was 0.941 +/- 0.215 cm(3) in men and 0.752 +/- 0.159 cm(3) in women. The length and diameter of the horizontal portion and the volume of the IPCA showed statistically significant differences according to sex (P < 0.05). No correlation with age was found.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study provides data concerning not only linear and angular measurements, but also volumes of the IPCA, which are useful in planning surgical interventions of the cranial base.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze relationships between CD34 expression and several demographic, clinical, and pathologic features in patients with histopathologic evidence of low-grade epilepsy-associated tumors who underwent epilepsy surgery.
   METHODS: A retrospective study enrolling 187 patients with low-grade epilepsy-associated tumors who underwent surgery between January 2009 and June 2015 at 8 Italian epilepsy surgery centers was conducted. All cases were histologically diagnosed according to the World Health Organization classification of central nervous system tumors. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify variables associated with CD34 expression.
   RESULTS: Of 187 patients, 95 (50.8%) were CD34 positive. Tumor type and duration of epilepsy were independently associated with CD34 expression on multivariate analysis. Ganglioglioma and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma were the histologic types with the strongest association with CD34 positivity with an odds ratio of 9.2 and 10.4, respectively, compared with dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors. Patients with a duration of epilepsy > 10 years had a significantly greater likelihood to show CD34 expression, with an odds ratio of 2.8 compared with patients with a duration of epilepsy < 2 years. On univariate analysis, CD34 expression appeared to be significantly related to older age at surgery, higher antiepileptic drug intake, and female sex.
   CONCLUSIONS: CD34 expression holds promise as a useful biomolecular marker for patients with low-grade epilepsy-associated tumors with evidence of a link with clinicopathologic features. This study confirmed the association between CD34 expression and tumor type and demonstrated a significantly higher probability of CD34 expression in patients with longer duration of epilepsy, independent of histology.

AB BACKGROUND: Traditional open approaches to correct lumbar spine deformities include 3-column osteotomies, such as a pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO). Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have been developed for lateral transpsoas anterior column realignment (ACR). These 2 techniques have not previously been combined. Our objective was to investigate the cadaveric feasibility of a combined hybrid MIS ACR-PSO technique for deformity correction and to review early clinical experience.
   METHODS: The feasibility of the combined ACR-PSO technique was evaluated in 4 fresh cadaveric specimens. The operative experience, complications, and early clinical outcomes in patients treated with the combined approach to correct global sagittal imbalance were reviewed.
   RESULTS: In the cadaveric study, the combined ACR-PSO resulted in a mean 46.0 degrees increase in lordosis (P < 0.001). Nine patients treated with ACR-PSO were evaluated (mean age, 65.2 years; 33.3% female). Most patients (6/9; 66.7%) underwent ACR at L1/2 or L3/4; 8 (88.8%) had PSO at L3 or L4. On average, 10.6 +/- 3.8 levels were fused. Significant decreases in mean pelvic tilt (P=0.01), spinopelvic mismatch (P < 0.001), and T1 spinopelvic inclination (P=0.03) were observed postoperatively; mean lumbar lordosis (P=0.007), intradiscal angle (P=0.001), and thoracic kyphosis (P=0.04) significantly increased. The overall complication rate was 55.6% (5/9).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our early experience suggests that a combined ACR-PSO with posterior fixation allows for significant correction of segmental lordosis and global imbalance. This combined approach may maximize results attainable with hybrid MIS-open surgical techniques and represents a complementary option to PSO and other posterior approaches.

ID ANTERIOR CERVICAL DECOMPRESSION; SCREW FIXATION; INSTRUMENTATION;

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the stability of multiple rod-connector construct designs using a mechanical 4-point bending testing frame.
   METHODS: A mechanical study was used to evaluate the bending stiffness of 3 connectors across 12 different configurations of rod-connector-rod constructs. Stability was evaluated in flexion-extension and lateral bending. Combinations of rods having 1 of 3 diameters (4.0 mm, 5.5 mm, and 6.0 mm) connected by 1 of 3 connector types (parallel open, snap-on, and hinged) were compared. Configurations with single connectors and with double connectors with variable spacing were also compared to simulate revision surgery conditions.
   RESULTS: Constructs consisting of 4.0-mm rods connected to 4.0-mm rods were significantly less stiff as the total number of connectors used in a series exceeded 2. When single-connector configurations were compared, parallel open rod connectors demonstrated greater stiffness in flexion-extension than hinged open connectors, whereas hinged open connectors demonstrated greater stiffness in lateral bending. Using double connectors increased stiffness of 4.0- to 4.0-mm rod configurations in flexion-extension and lateral bending, 4.0- to 6.0-mm rod configurations in flexion-extension, and 5.5- to 6.0-mm rod configurations in lateral bending. Spacing the double connectors significantly improved lateral bending stiffness of 4.0- to 4.0-mm and 5.5- to 6.0-mm rod configurations.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the design, number, and placement of rod connectors have a significant impact on the bending stiffness of a surgical construct. Such mechanical data may influence construct design in primary and revision surgeries of the cervical spine and cervicothoracic junction.

AB OBJECTIVE: We assessed the efficacy of "only fixation" as treatment for cervical radiculopathy.
   METHODS: From 2012 to December 2017, 21 patients who had presented with primary symptoms related to cervical radiculopathy, including radiating pain, tingling paresthesia, numbness, weakness, and wasting were treated by facetal stabilization surgery aimed at achieving segmental arthrodesis. No decompression by removal of bone, disc material, or osteophyte was performed. The age of the patients ranged from 27 to 59 years. Of the 21 patients, 19 were men and 2 were women. The imaging findings showed a herniated disc in 4, a disc bulge in 12, and osteophyte-related foraminal stenosis in 5 patients. Transarticular screw fixation was deployed for surgery. The levels of cervical fixation were guided by the clinical and radiological information and determined by direct observation of the facet morphology and stability by manual manipulation of the bones in the region.
   RESULTS: All the patients experienced "remarkable" relief of the presenting radicular symptoms in the "immediate" postoperative period. The visual analog scale and neck disability index scores were used to assess the patients before and after surgical treatment. During the follow-up period, which ranged from 6 to 64 months, all the patients continued to experience satisfactory symptomatic relief.
   CONCLUSIONS: Instability of the spinal segment is the nodal point of pathogenesis and the primary cause of symptoms related to degenerative spondylotic radiculopathy. The treatment is spinal stabilization. No direct bone or soft tissue decompression is necessary.

AB OBJECTIVE: The implications of diagnosis and treatment of central or axial atlantoaxial dislocation (CAAD) as a cause of symptoms of cervical myelopathy are evaluated.
   METHODS: This is a report of a series of 5 patients who presented with the primary symptoms of spasticity and motor weakness and paresthesias in all the limbs. There was no evidence of any significant compression of the dural tube or neural structures at the craniovertebral junction. There was no craniovertebral junction instability when assessed by classically described radiologic parameters. CAAD was diagnosed based on our recently discussed parameter of facetal alignment, corroborative clinical and radiologic evidence, and direct observation of atlantoaxial instability by manual manipulation of the bones of the region. All patients underwent atlantoaxial fixation.
   RESULTS: There was remarkable improvement in the clinical symptoms in the immediate postoperative period and during the follow-up period of 12-24 months (average, 16 months). All patients have continued to have progressive clinical recovery. Clinical assessments were done using Goel clinical evaluation scale, Japanese Orthopedic Association score, and visual analog scale.
   CONCLUSIONS: Identification and treatment of CAAD can have a significant management impact on patients where the cause of spastic quadriparesis is otherwise undiagnosed.

AB OBJECTIVE: Voice alteration as a presenting symptom in cases with Chiari formation is analyzed, as well as outcome after atlantoaxial fixation.
   METHODS: During the period January 2016 to June 2017, 25 cases of Chiari formation presented with associated or a major presenting symptom of voice or speech quality alteration related to inadequate breathing efforts. All patients underwent atlantoaxial fixation. No foramen magnum decompression was done.
   RESULTS: In all patients, the voice quality and volume and breathing disturbances improved in the immediate postoperative period after recovering from anesthesia. During the period of follow-up that ranged from 12 to 25 months, all patients continued to improve in their speech function.
   CONCLUSIONS: Such critical symptoms of voice disturbance and inadequate breathing and the possibility of rapid postoperative recovery have not been recorded earlier in the literature.

AB BACKGROUND: Scalp arteriovenous malformation (SAVM) is primarily treated by surgery and reports on endovascular treatment are scarce. We report the results of an endovascular-first approach in the treatment of SAVM. We also have proposed a simple dichotomized classification using the angiographically determined morphology findings and discussed its effect on therapeutic decisionmaking and outcomes.
   METHODS: A consecutive series of 25 patients with SAVM treated by initial or endovascular-only methods were included in the final analysis. The SAVM was categorized as a plexiform or fistulous type according to the angiographic morphology. The demographic data, treatment variables, and final clinical outcomes were analyzed and correlated with the proposed classification.
   RESULTS: Of the 25 patients, 21 were treated with n-butyl cyanoacrylate (n-BCA) and 3 with liquid ethylene vinyl alcohol. One patient had been treated initially with polyvinyl alcohol particles and later with n-BCA. Overall, complete or near complete obliteration (> 90%) was achieved in 72%. Surgical excision was performed in 76%, most often after n-BCA embolization. Fistulous-type SAVMs required greater n-BCA concentrations (median, 33% vs. 20%; P = 0.024) and achieved greater rates of complete or near-complete obliteration (90% vs. 63%). Two patients with fistulous-type SAVMs treated with liquid ethylene vinyl alcohol showed complete resolution, and further treatment was not necessary. Overall, regardless of the embolic material used, the fistulous type demonstrated a significantly greater rate of complete obliteration (75% vs. 33%; P = 0.041) compared with plexiform type.
   CONCLUSION: High rates of complete and durable obliteration of SAVM are achievable with endovascular embolization. The proposed simplified classification is easy to implement and can aid in choosing the appropriate embolic agent and predicting the therapeutic outcome.

DE Default mode network; Prognosis; Resting-state fMRI; Severe traumatic
   brain injury
ID DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; CONNECTIVITY; MRI
AB BACKGROUND: We investigate the change of the default mode network (DMN) by using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and functional connectivity (FC) methods in acute phase patients after severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) and correlate these changes with prognosis.
   METHODS: Twenty-one patients with sTBI were included. Twenty-one healthy sex-, age-, and education-matched control subjects were recruited for the control group. Of the 21 patients with sTBI, 12 patients regained consciousness (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS] score > 2) and 9 patients remained unconscious (GOS score < 2). FC and ALFF values were measured in the DMN and compared between the groups. We further assessed and compared the FC and ALFF values in both groups.
   RESULTS: Patients with sTBI showed significantly decreased FC and ALFF values in the DMN. However, patients with a better prognosis showed a significant increase in FC and ALFF values in the DMN. The conscious subgroup showed significantly enhanced FC in the medial superior frontal gyrus, left temporal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, and parietal cortex compared with the coma subgroup. Increased ALFF values in the right frontal gyrus, right temporal gyrus, and right inferior parietal gyrus were significant in the conscious subgroup compared with the coma subgroup.
   CONCLUSIONS: Increases in FC and ALFF values in the DMN are related to better prognosis in patients with sTBI.

TI The Effect and Safety of Polymethylmethacrylate-Augmented Sacral Pedicle
   Screws Applied in Osteoporotic Spine with Lumbosacral Degenerative
   Disease: A 2-Year Follow-up of 25 Patients
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

   Sacral screw
ID SPINOPELVIC PARAMETERS; FIXATION; ALIGNMENT; FUSION; S1
AB BACKGROUND: A high rate of instrumentation failure is frequently seen in osteoporotic spines, especially at the sacral segment because of the great shear stress. Several techniques of sacral pedicle screw placement, such as bicortical and tricortical fixation, have been developed; however, the problems of loosening and pulling out of the screws are still a concern. Recently, the polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)-augmented pedicle screws have been shown to strengthen the purchase in osteoporotic spine, but there are few reports on the effect of S1 pedicle screw with PMMA augmentation.
   METHODS: Seventy-five patients receiving cement-augmented pedicle screws at lumbosacral vertebra were enrolled and divided into 3 groups by different patterns of S1 pedicle screw placement: S1 pedicle screw with PMMA augmentation (group A, 25 patients), S1 bicortical pedicle screw fixation (group B, 25 patients), and S1 tricortical pedicle screw fixation (group C, 25 patients). The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were assessed preoperatively and at the last follow-up. Besides, the complications, loosening rate, and fusion rate were recorded.
   RESULTS: The VAS and ODI scores at the last follow-up were significantly improved in the 3 groups compared with preoperative results. Better pain relief and functional improvement at the last follow-up was seen in group A compared with the other 2 groups; however, no significant difference was detected between groups B and C. Although the lowest screws loosening rates and the highest fusion rate were found in group A, no significant difference among these 3 groups. Furthermore, longer fusion segments and larger postoperative pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis (PL-LL) were found as risks related to S1 screw loosening without cement augmentation.
   CONCLUSIONS: The S1 pedicle screws with PMMA augmentation achieved better stability with less screw loosening in the osteoporotic spine with lumbosacral degenerative diseases compared with bicortical/tricortical fixation at S1. This procedure is especially recommended for patients with long segment fixation and large postoperative PI-LL, but there is also a risk of bone cement leakage and a learning curve.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine if there is a difference in reoperation rates for symptomatic nonunions in atlantoaxial (C1-C2) fusions with or without bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) using data from a national spine registry and to analyze the different types of bone grafts used in the non-BMP group.
   METHODS: Data from the Kaiser Permanente spine registry were used to identify patients with C1-C2 fusions with > 2 years follow-up. Patient characteristics, diagnosis, operative times, length of stay, and reoperations were extracted from the registry. The data set was divided into patients with and without BMP. Further analysis was made of the different types of non-BMP grafts as well as the instrumentation used.
   RESULTS: In our cohort, we found 58 patients (53.7%) with BMP and 50 patients (46.3%) without with an average follow-up time of 5 years (interquartile range, 2.04-8.49). The BMP versus non-BMP groups differed in admitting diagnosis, operative times, length of stay, and follow-up times. There were no reoperations for symptomatic nonunions in both groups. The non-BMP group included iliac crest graft (with or without allograft [D/L] allograft); lamina (D/L allograft); and allograft alone.
   CONCLUSIONS: Using one of the largest retrospective studies on C1-C2 fusions with and without BMP, we found no difference in reoperation rates for symptomatic nonunions. For the non-BMP group, we found that lamina (D/L allograft) or allograft alone may also be just as effective as iliac crest graft (D/L allograft) in having no reoperations for symptomatic nonunions.

AB OBJECTIVE: Readmission and reoperation are risks in the resection of benign cranial nerve tumors (BCNTs). This report analyzes the impact of patient-level and surgical factors on these adverse outcomes.
   METHODS: This retrospective cohort review comprised patients with a diagnosis of BCNT enrolled in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program registry from 2011 to 2015. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the impact of select medical and operative factors on the primary outcomes of readmission and reoperation within 30 days, adjusted for relevant covariates.
   RESULTS: We identified 996 patients who underwent resection of a BCNT. The most frequent major complications were readmission (11%), reoperation (8%), surgical site infections (2.6%), and venous thromboembolism (1.5%). The most frequent indications for readmission were management of infection (2.5%), cerebrospinal fluid leak (2.3%), and hydrocephalus (0.5%). Repair of cranial and meningeal defects (3.0%), correction of lagophthalmos (1.2%), and repair of middle ear defects (1.0%) were the most common indications for reoperation. Logistic regression revealed that extremes of age were associated with readmission, whereas preoperative steroid usage, long operative time, and postoperative length of stay > 3 days were associated with reoperation (P < 0.05). Obesity trended toward an association with readmission and reoperation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Extremes of age were associated with readmission; preoperative steroid use, long operative time, and postoperative length of stay > 3 days were associated with reoperation. Surgeons should consider these factors when assessing risk of postoperative complications for BCNTs.

DT Article
DE Anastomosis; Bypass; Practical scale
ID MICROVASCULAR ANASTOMOSIS; SUTURE
AB BACKGROUND: Several factors associated with interrupted and continuous suturing techniques affect the quality of bypass anastomosis. It is difficult to determine the impact of these factors during surgery. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate factors with the potential to influence the quality of bypass anastomosis using either interrupted or continuous suturing. A secondary objective was to evaluate the usefulness of a practical scale when comparing interrupted and continuous suturing techniques to improve bypass anastomosis.
   METHODS: Interrupted (n = 100) and continuous (n = 100) suturing techniques were used in 200 end-to-side bypasses to a depth of 3 cm and were assessed by 5 neurosurgeons.
   RESULTS: Vessel closing time (P < 0.001), stitch distribution (P < 0.001), intima-intima attachment (P < 0.001), and size of the orifice (P < 0.001) had a significant impact on the quality of the bypass regardless of the suturing technique used. The suturing technique used (interrupted or continuous) and positioning of the recipient vessel (vertical or horizontal) did not significantly influence the quality of anastomosis. Using multivariate analysis, the highest statistical significance with regard to bypass quality was attributed to the large size of the orifice and intimal attachment.
   CONCLUSIONS: There were advantages and disadvantages to both suturing techniques. The scale was a practical way to measure and improve performance.

AB OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the physical extent of Modic type 1 (MT1) changes and other phenotypic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in the vertebrae of patients with low back pain (LBP) and MT1 changes. We also identified any correlations of these findings with the severity of pain and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The relationship between the presence of pain and MT1 changes has been examined in several studies. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has assessed the relationships between pain severity and ODI and the total vertebral area of MT1 involvement.
   METHODS: After excluding any patient with MT2 or MT3 changes, 49 patients with a diagnosis of LBP and MT1 changes demonstrated on MRI were included. MT1 involvement area, disc height, number of Schmorl's nodes, disc degeneration (Pfirrmann grade), and cross-sectional area of the lumbar muscles were obtained via MRI. Additionally, patient demographic data, body mass index, physical activity level, and disability (ODI) scores were assessed.
   RESULTS: The total vertebral area of MT1 involvement correlated significantly and positively with the ODI (P = 0.001). In the multivariate linear regression model, with ODI as the dependent variable and age, mean Pfirrmann grade, total vertebral area of MT1 involvement, and sex as independent variables, only the total vertebral area of MT1 involvement was significantly associated with the ODI.
   CONCLUSIONS: A significant positive correlation was noted between the vertebral MT1 involvement extent and changes in the ODI. Other MRI features of patients with LBP were not related to pain severity or ODI.

AB BACKGROUND: Extended fusion can be performed in patients with Lenke 5C adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) with a large and relatively rigid thoracic curve. Progression of the thoracic curve is related to coronal imbalance. We aimed to determine the correlation between the upper instrumented vertebra choice and coronal balance in patients with Lenke 5C AIS.
   METHODS: A total of 61 patients with Lenke 5C AIS underwent posterior fusion from 2009 to 2015 in a single institution with >= 2 years of follow-up data available. The extended fusion group (n = 32) and thoracolumbar/lumbar (TL/L) fusion group (n = 29) were compared for the correction rates for the main TL/L and thoracic curves, coronal balance, upper end vertebra (UEV) tilt, and Scoliosis Research Society-22 questionnaire score.
   RESULTS: Both groups had excellent correction of the main TL/L curve, and the extended fusion group had a significantly greater correction rate of the thoracic curve than the TL/L fusion group (70.2% vs. 57.3%). The incidence of coronal imbalance was similar in both groups. The spontaneous change in UEV tilt was associated with the change in coronal balance from the first to the final followup examination. In the TL/L fusion group, the increase in UEV tilt from the first to final follow-up visit resulted in improved coronal balance at the final follow-up examination. Both groups had similar Scoliosis Research Society22 questionnaire scores at 2 years postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Lenke 5C AIS, thoracic curve fusion results in better correction of the thoracic curve but no improvement in coronal balance. With TL/L fusion, a postoperative UEV tilt > 5 degrees leads to better coronal balance.

AB BACKGROUND: The use of posterior vertebral column resection (PVCR) has extended the treatment of severe spinal deformity. However, the practice guidelines for anterior column support in patients treated by PVCR remain ill defined. The objective of the present study was to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of severe thoracic spinal deformity treated by PVCR with and without anterior column support (ACS).
   METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 57 patients with severe thoracic deformity (classified as Yang's A type) treated by PVCR with or without anterior column support from January 2010 to April 2015. The patient characteristics, radiographic parameters, intraoperative data, and complications were analyzed to clarify these 2 clinical series.
   RESULTS: The sex, age, diagnosis, curve magnitude, and curve type were similar between the PVCR with ACS group (n = 21) and non-ACS group (n = 36) preoperatively. Evaluation of the radiographic parameters, intraoperative data, and complications found no statistically significant intergroup differences, except for the osteotomy distance (non-ACS group, 4.0 cm; ACS group, 5.3 cm; P < 0.001) and shortening distance of the osteotomy gap (non-ACS group, 4.0 cm; ACS group, 3.5 cm; P = 0.005).
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study have shown that PVCR without ACS seems to be a safe and effective technique for Yang's A type severe thoracic spinal deformity correction compared with PVCR with ACS. PVCR without ACS requires a relatively smaller osteotomy range and could potentially decrease the risk of implant failure due to bone to bone fusion.

AB BACKGROUND: This study aims to investigate the utility of F-18-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine (F-18-FET) positron emission tomography in surgical decision making in suspected glioma.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of patients undergoing F-18-FET positron emission tomography was performed. Previously published thresholds for maximum tumor background ratios (TBRs) were used for quantitative analysis. Forty-seven patients were included in the study, of whom 15 had confirmed glioma and 7 had a confirmed alternative diagnosis.
   RESULTS: F-18-FET showed significantly higher uptake in high-grade glioma than in nonglioma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Lesions with TBRmax > 2.5 should be considered suspicious for glioma and biopsy considered. Threshold TBRmax > 3.0 is useful for differentiating highgrade glioma from low-grade glioma. This may be a particularly useful tool for directing management in eloquent areas, such as brainstem glioma.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the predictive value of preoperative fear-avoidance factors (self-efficacy for exercise, pain catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, and depression), walking capacity, and traditional predictor variables for predicting postoperative changes in physical activity level and disability 6 months after lumbar fusion surgery in patients with chronic low back pain (LBP).
   METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 118 patients scheduled for lumbar fusion surgery for motion-elicited chronic LBP with degenerative changes in 1-3 segments of the lumbar spine. Associations between the predictors and the dependent variables were investigated with multiple linear regression analysis. Dependent variables were physical activity level as objectively measured with a triaxial accelerometer and disability as measured with the Oswestry Disability Index.
   RESULTS: Preoperative physical activity level (beta = -0.349; P<0.001) and self-efficacy for exercise (beta = 0.176; P = 0.021) were significant predictors of the postoperative change in physical activity. Preoperative disability (beta = -0.790; P<0.001), self-efficacy for exercise (beta = 0.152; P = 0.024), and pain catastrophizing (beta = 0.383; P = 0.033) were significant predictors for the change in the Oswestry Disability Index.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low levels of preoperative physical activity were more likely to increase their level of physical activity after lumbar fusion surgery, especially when their self-efficacy for exercise was high. However, most of these patients still had low levels of physical activity after surgery, and they may therefore need extra support in increasing their postoperative physical activity levels.

ID H-INDEX; PLACEMENT; FACULTY
AB BACKGROUND: Factors affecting academic productivity of neurosurgeons are increasingly being studied. In the current investigation, we retrospectively reviewed a cohort of early career neurosurgeons to determine if their medical education, residency training, or academic employer had the most influence on a young academician's productivity.
   METHODS: We studied early career neurosurgeons who completed residency in U.S.-based neurosurgical training programs between 2010 and 2014. The ranking of an individual subject's medical school, residency, and current academic employer were analyzed for correlation with his or her current h-index.
   RESULTS: The neurosurgeons with the highest h-indexes are more likely to have attended elite medical schools, have trained in high-ranking residency programs, and work for prestigious university departments (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, we identified a positive correlation between the subjects' academic productivity and the ranking of all the institutions throughout their medical education, training, and current employment. The strongest correlation was with the rank of their residency program (r = 0.52).
   CONCLUSIONS: There is a correlation between the early career academic neurosurgeons' h-indexes and the ranking of all the institutions throughout their education, training, and current employment, but the strongest correlation was with the academic productivity of their residency program.

AB BACKGROUND: The endovascular coiling procedure to treat cerebral aneurysms using contrast media has become more popular. However, studies of the incidence of, and risk factors for, contrast media-induced nephropathy (CIN) after coiling procedures have been limited. Thus, we evaluated the incidence and risk factors for CIN in patients who had undergone cerebral aneurysmal coiling procedures.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the electric medical records of 380 patients who had undergone cerebral aneurysmal coiling treatment under general anesthesia. CIN was defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine (>= 0.5 mg/dL) or a relative increase (>= 25%) in the baseline serum creatinine value at 48-72 hours after exposure to a contrast agent.
   RESULTS: Elective cerebral aneurysmal coiling procedures were performed in 230 patients. Of the 230 patients, CIN developed in 13 (5.6%). The presence of diabetes mellitus (30.8% vs. 9.7%; P = 0.040) and patient age > 75 years (30.8% vs. 6.5%; P = 0.012) were risk factors for CIN.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study has demonstrated that the incidence of CIN in patients undergoing elective cerebral aneurysmal coiling procedures is similar to 6.0%. We also identified underlying diabetes mellitus and advanced age (>= 75 years) as potential risk factors.

AB BACKGROUND: The disease-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (ds-GPA) for patients with gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancer brain metastases (BM) suggests Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) as the only pertinent prognostic factor. We evaluated the prognostic importance of cumulative intracranial tumor volume (CITV).
   METHODS: KPS, CITV, and overall survivalwere collected from consecutive patients with stereotactic radiosurgerye treated GI BM. Patients were grouped into 2 independent cohorts for development and validation of the model (termed "exploratory" and "validation" cohorts). Analyses were performed using logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards models, Net Reclassification Index (NRI > 0), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI > 0), and Akaike information criterion.
   RESULTS: In univariable logistic regression models, both CITV and KPS were independently associated with patient survival. The association between CITV and overall survival remained robust after controlling for KPS (P < 0.001) in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. Based on NRI analysis of the exploratory cohort, we found that a CITV cutoff of 12 cm(3) best augments the prognostic accuracy of GI-ds-GPA. In this analysis, incorporation of CITV (as < or >= 12 cm(3)) improved prognostication of the GIspecific GPA model by NRI > 0 of 0.397 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.165-0.630; P < 0.001) and IDI of 0.019 (95% CI, 0.004-0.033; P = 0.013). We confirmed the prognostic usefulness of the CITV-incorporated GI-ds-GPA in an independent validation cohort, in which CITV incorporation improved prognostic usefulness with an NRI > 0 of 0.478 (95% CI, 0.257-0.699; P < 0.001) and IDI of 0.028 (95% CI, 0.014-0.043; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: CITV is an important prognostic variable in patients with stereotactic radiosurgeryetreated GI BMand augments the prognostic accuracy of the GI-ds-GPA index.

   RISK; FEATURES; HYPOXIA; GROWTH
AB BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is known to reduce stroke risk in patients with symptomatic, moderate to severe carotid stenosis but has no apparent impact in patients with symptomatic, mild (less than 50%) carotid stenosis. However, recent development of noninvasive imaging modalities has shown that a certain subgroup of patients are at high risk for further ischemic events despite antiplatelet therapy. This study, therefore, aimed to clarify the patients' clinical features and explore the impact of CEA for them.
   METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 74 patients who underwent CEA for symptomatic carotid stenosis between April 2012 and December 2016. Of these, 16 (22%) had mild (less than 50%) carotid stenosis. Their demographic, radiologic, intraoperative, and pathologic findings were precisely analyzed, and their outcome after CEA was examined for 38.5 +/- 13.3 months.
   RESULTS: Of these 16 patients, 12 had already been treated with antiplatelets against previous ischemic cerebrovascular or coronary artery diseases. Plaque magnetic resonance imaging revealed that all patients had vulnerable plaque, including lipid-rich plaque (n = 6) and intraplaque hemorrhage (n = 10). Intraoperative observations confirmed this. Histologic analysis revealed that inflammatory cells and fragile angiogenesis were widely found in the specimens. Only 1 patient experienced transient (less than 30 days) neurologic deficit after CEA, and none of them repeated cerebrovascular events during the follow-up period.
   -CONCLUSIONS: It is not rare the patients who are at high risk for subsequent ischemic events because of vulnerable plaque despite mild (less than 50%) carotid stenosis. Magnetic resonance imaging is quite useful to noninvasively detect such vulnerable plaque. CEA is a promising procedure to treat these patients.

AB BACKGROUND: The etiology of Chiari I malformation (CMI) has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we performed a genetic study of a Turkish family in which 3 sisters had a diagnosis of CMI with or without syringomyelia.
   METHODS: In a family with 7 children, 4 daughters complained of occipital headaches. In 2 of these daughters, CMI had been diagnosed during their 30s, and CMI plus syrinx had been diagnosed in the other daughter in her 40s. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging of the fourth daughter who had developed headaches during her 30s showed normal findings. Because the other siblings in the family were asymptomatic, radiological examinations were not performed. The family had a history of distant consanguineous marriage between parents. Additionally, the father had died, and the mother was asymptomatic, with radiologically normal findings. Array comparative genome hybridization studies were performed for 12 persons from 3 generations of this family.
   RESULTS: None of the 12 cases examined harbored copy number variations.
   CONCLUSIONS: This family with 3 sisters having CMI suggested a possible autosomal recessive single-gene etiology. Cases of familial CMI are unusual but important to study because they could reveal the specific genes involved in posterior fossa/foramen magnum structure and function and provide insights into the cause of sporadic cases.

AB OBJECTIVE: Thin-walled regions (TIWRs) within cerebral aneurysms have a high risk of rupture during surgical manipulation. Previous reports have demonstrated specific changes in the parameters of computational fluid dynamics in TIWRs; however, they have not been fully evaluated. We identified and investigated a novel parameter, wall shear stress vector cycle variation (WSSVV), with user-friendly software that could predict TIWRs.
   METHODS: Twelve unruptured cerebral aneurysms were analyzed. TIWRs were defined as reddish areas compared with the normal-colored parent artery on intraoperative views. The position and orientation of these clinical images were adjusted to match the WSSVV color maps. TIWRs and thick-walled regions (TKWRs) were marked and compared with the corresponding regions on WSSVV maps. The default images obtained from WSSVV imaging required appropriate maximum color bar value (MCBV) adjustment for predicting TIWRs. Sensitivity and specificity analyses were performed by changing the MCBV from 300 to 700 at intervals of 100. With the optimal MCBV, the WSSVV values were quantitatively compared.
   RESULTS: All of the selected 18 TIWRs and 16 TKWRs corresponded to low-and high-value regions of the WSSVV color maps at the adjusted MCBV, respectively. The mean optimal MCBVwas 483.3 +/- 167.50 (range, 300-700). According to receiver operating characteristic analysis, the best MCBV for predicting TIWRs was 500 (highest sensitivity, 0.89; specificity, 0.94). Under this condition, the quantitative values of the computational fluid dynamics color maps for TIWRs and TKWRs were significantly different (P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Low WSSVV values may indicate TIWRs within cerebral aneurysms.

AB BACKGROUND: Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) plays a major role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. In hypoxic conditions, HIF is upregulated and has been shown to activate multiple genes required for cells to adapt to hypoxia. AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A), a SWI/SNF (switch/sucrose nonfermentable) chromatin remodeling gene has context-dependent tumorsuppressive and oncogenic roles in cancer. We assessed the correlations between the expression and mutations of HIF1A and ARID1A in histopathologically confirmed pituitary adenomas.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 71 patients who had undergone surgery for pituitary adenoma. Patient demographic, radiological, and histopathological features were correlated with HIF1A and ARID1A expression.
   RESULTS: Most cases were HIF1A positive (62%). No significant correlation was found between HIF1A expression and age, gender, tumor size, bone erosion, hemorrhage, or Ki-67 index. An inverse correlation was demonstrated between HIF1A and cavernous sinus invasion (P = 0.035). ARID1A loss was found in 28.2% of pituitary adenomas. No significant correlation was found between ARID1A and any of the assessed variables.
   CONCLUSIONS: In our patient cohort, we found that most pituitary adenomas expressed HIF1A. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to assess the presence of ARID1A loss in pituitary adenomas, which occurred in 28.2% of cases. No individual demographic, imaging, or histopathological feature was predictive of ARID1A. Likewise, with the exception of an increased incidence of cavernous sinus invasion, no correlation was found with HIF1A. Given the prognostic value of these markers in other malignancies, their frequency in pituitary adenomas warrants further exploration of their potential role in pituitary adenoma treatment and outcome.

AB OBJECTIVE: The surgical repair of a cerebral aneurysm does not always lead to complete occlusion. A standardized repeatable method of reporting results of surgical clipping is desirable. Our purpose was to systematically review methods of classifying aneurysm remnants, provide a new scale with precise definitions of categories, and perform an agreement study to assess the variability in adjudicating remnants after aneurysm clipping.
   METHODS: A systematic review was performed to identify ways to report angiographic results of surgical clipping between 1963 and 2017. Postclipping angiographic results of 43 patients were also independently evaluated by 10 raters of various experience and backgrounds using a new 4-category scale. Agreement between responses were analyzed using k statistics.
   RESULTS: The systematic review yielded 63 articleswith 37 different nomenclatures using 2-6 categories. The reliability of judging the presence of an aneurysm remnant on catheter angiography was studied only twice, with only 2 raters each time, with contradictory results. Interobserver agreement using the new 4-category scale was moderate (k = 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.43-0.62) for all observers, but improved to substantial (k = 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.76) when results were dichotomized (grade 0/1 vs. 2/3).
   CONCLUSIONS: Various classification schemes to evaluate angiographic results after surgical clipping exist in the literature, but they lack standardization. Adjudication using fewer, better defined categories may yield more reliable agreement.

AB BACKGROUND: Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is an alternative, less-invasive, and, in some circumstances, effective treatment for patients with intracranial pathology including epilepsy and some tumors. For intracranial lesions in eloquent areas, resection by conventional craniotomy proves often to be a challenge, including in the care of pediatric patients. Herein, we reviewed our experience with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided LITTas treatment for pediatric patients with intracranial lesions in eloquent areas and evaluate neurologic function and clinical outcomes.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with intracranial lesions in eloquent speech and motor areas who underwent MRI-guided LITT. Clinical evaluation, including neurologic function and neuropsychological testing, was conducted according to clinical considerations. MRI pre-and postoperative imaging was reviewed to compare the change of lesion size.
   RESULTS: Five pediatric patients received MRI-guided LITT of intracranial lesions in eloquent cortex. One patient experienced complications secondary to MRI-guided LITT, but neither was discharged with a neurologic deficit.
   CONCLUSIONS: For intracranial lesions in the eloquent cortex, conventional craniotomy with surgical resection is a challenge for neurosurgeons, especially pediatric patients. MRI-guided LITT provides a less-invasive and potentially effective option for treatment in the management of pediatric epilepsy and tumors.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine reference values for the sagittal plane alignment of the thoracolumbar junction (TLJ) in a young adult Korean population.
   METHODS: Thoracolumbar computed tomography (CT) scans of 1000 individuals (age range, 20-39 years; 500 men and 500 women) from Hanyang University Health Care Center were reviewed. All subjects had no spinal pathology or a history of previous spinal surgery. The segmental (each level from T11 to L2) and global (T11-L1 and T11-L2) Cobb angles of the TLJ of the spine were measured in midsagittal CT scans. Moreover, comparisons between the 2 age groups (20s and 30s) and sexes were performed.
   RESULTS: The segmental Cobb angles of T11, T12, L1, and L2 were 6.5 degrees +/- 3.9 degrees, 5.5 degrees +/- 4.1 degrees, 2.2 degrees +/- 4.7 degrees, and L3.3 degrees +/- 5.3 degrees, respectively. The global Cobb angles of T11-L1 and T11-L2 were 6.5 degrees +/- 5.2 degrees and 0.5 degrees +/- 6.1 degrees, respectively. There were no differences in the sagittal alignment between the 2 age groups. Women presented less kyphotic and more lordotic alignment in the lumbar spine (L1 and L2) than men; however, the thoracic spine (T11 and T12) alignment was not different between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study provides reference values with a wide physiologic range for the sagittal alignment of the TLJ of the spine in a young adult Korean population.

AB BACKGROUND: Neural tube defects are a large health burden for East African countries. Health strategies in the prevention of this disease include nutritional prophylaxis, prenatal diagnosis, and availability of early neonatal neurosurgery. The main objective of this study is to describe our experience in the early surgical management of neural tube defects in the Zanzibar archipelago.
   METHODS: From December 2016 to December 2017, we prospectively collected data on all patients admitted with the diagnosis of myelomeningocele. We collected variables regarding demographics, maternal health, preoperative imaging, surgical procedures, and complications at follow-up.
   RESULTS: We collected data on 19 patients. Mean age was 9.8 +/- 18.7 days. Of these patients, 52.6% were male and 47.3% were female; 47.3% patients were from Unguja, 42.0% from Pemba, and 5.2% from mainland Tanzania; 68.4% of all mothers were found to have undergone prenatal ultrasonography and 89.5% of all patients received surgery. Surgical wound infection was present in 29.4% of all surgical patients and 52.9% developed secondary hydrocephalus.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neural tube defects are a prevailing condition in East Africa. We believe that more health initiatives should address its prevention, mainly through maternal nutrition. On the basis of our findings, we consider early neonatal neurosurgery as the most important factor in reducing immediate morbidity and mortality.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify potential risk factors for the development of shunt-dependent chronic hydrocephalus after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and external ventricular drain (EVD) insertion. In particular, the role of inflammatory markers within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was assessed.
   METHODS: For this single-center analysis, data were generated from consecutive patients with SAH and the need for EVD implantation treated on our neurosurgical intensive care unit between 2013 and 2015. Parameters were patient characteristics (age, sex, comorbidity), severity of SAH (according to the World Federation of Neurological Society score), imaging findings (intraventricular hemorrhage, diameter of the third ventricle, location of the ruptured aneurysm), and acute course of disease (cerebral infarction, vasospasm). Moreover, the impact of EVD drainage volume and CSF markers (total protein [CSFTP], red blood cell count [CSFRBC], interleukin-6 [CSFIL-6], and glucose [CSFGlc]) was assessed. Statistics including receiver-operating-curve with corresponding area-underthe-curve (AUC) analysis were calculated using SPSS.
   RESULTS: Overall, 63 patients (21 males, mean age 55.2 years) were included. Twenty-one patients (30%) developed a shunt-dependent hydrocephalus. Significant risk factors for shunt dependency were the World Federation of Neurological Society score, cerebral infarction, and diameter of the third ventricle (P < 0.05). Moreover, CSF markers associated with shunt-dependent hydrocephalus included increased levels of CSFTP on days 5 (AUC [0.72)/11 (AUC=0.97)/14 (AUC [0.98), CSFIL-6 on day 14 (AUC =0.81), and CSFRBC on day 15 (AUC[0.83). The EVD drainage volume was not prognostic.
   CONCLUSIONS: The time course of selected inflammatory markers in CSF may support management considerations in the early phase after SAH and critical impairment of CSF circulation.

AB PURPOSE: Carotid atherosclerotic plaque occurs predominantly at the outer wall of the carotid sinus, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) plays an important role in explaining plaque formation. The present study investigated the hemodynamic factors affecting carotid atherosclerotic stenosis.
   METHODS: Sixteen patients with normal carotid arteries and 16 with symptomatic stenotic carotid sinus underwent 3-dimensional angiographic imaging evaluations and were studied with CFD to simulate the complete 3-dimensional blood flow and hemodynamic parameter distribution in the carotid bifurcations. The hemodynamic parameters, including wall shear stress (WSS), dynamic and total pressure, total pressure gradient, strain rate, velocity, and velocity angle, were investigated.
   RESULTS: The atherosclerosis-prone outer lateral walls of the carotid sinus and the external carotid artery at its start had significantly (P < 0.05) low dynamic pressure, WSS, strain rate, and total pressure gradient but high static pressure. The blood flow near these walls with flow separation had significantly (P < 0.05) decreased velocity and dynamic pressures but a high velocity angle. The carotid divider had significantly (P < 0.05) elevated dynamic and total pressure, WSS, strain rate, and total pressure gradient but reduced static pressure. Additional stenosis occurred at the downstream area of stenosis with significantly (P < 0.05) decreased dynamic pressure, WSS, strain rate, and total pressure gradient similar to the wall at the sinus and the start of the external carotid artery.
   CONCLUSION: Significantly decreased vascular WSS, dynamic pressure, strain rate, and total pressure gradient are key to atherosclerotic plaque formation at the carotid sinus.

ID DISSOCIATED MOTOR LOSS; UPPER EXTREMITY; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Cervical spondylotic amyotrophy (CSA) is not common. The clinical features and long-term surgical outcomes of patients with CSA are also unclear. We sought to summarize clinical features, assess long-term surgical outcomes, and determine the prognostic factors relevant for patients with CSA.
   METHODS: A total of 136 patients with CSA who underwent anterior or posterior decompression during January 2001 to December 2012 were included. Their clinical and radiologic data were collected. The surgical outcome was evaluated using manual muscle test and improvements in the muscle strength. Correlations between the surgical outcome and various factors also were analyzed.
   RESULTS: In total, 128 patients underwent anterior decompression and 8 patients underwent posterior decompression. At the final follow-up, the surgical outcome was significantly better after anterior decompression compared with that after posterior decompression. Statistical analyses showed the type of CSA, duration of symptoms, and association with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament were associated with a poor outcome after anterior surgery (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Besides significant muscular atrophy in one upper extremity, CSA also occasionally presents with mild atrophy in the other upper extremity, sensory disturbance in the upper extremities, or hyperflexia in the lower extremities. Anterior decompression is generally effective in the treatment of patients with CSA. Preoperative duration of symptoms, type of CSA, and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament are important predictors for the surgical outcome.

AB OBJECTIVE: Craniopharyngiomas have traditionally been resected through the transcranial approaches (TCA). The endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) has recently been developed as an alternative for surgeons, but controversy remains regarding which approach has better outcomes. We compared the endocrine and metabolic outcomes of TCA and EEA in patients who underwent primary resection of craniopharyngiomas.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients with craniopharyngioma who were treated by the department of endocrinology and metabolism at our institution between 2011 and 2015.
   RESULTS: Of 43 patients assessed, 26 underwent TCA and 17 underwent EEA. After surgery, 29.4% (5/17) of patients in the EEA group had normal anterior pituitary function, whereas none in the TCA group had complete anterior pituitary function. Higher prevalences of corticotropic deficiency (92.3% vs. 52.9%, P = 0.009), thyrotrophic deficiency (96.2% vs. 52.9%, P = 0.003), and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (100% vs. 70.6%, P=0.014) were found in the TCA group. The TCA group showed a trend toward having more patients with at least 3 anterior pituitary deficits (88.5% vs. 58.8%, P = 0.060). The mean body mass index at last follow-up tended to be lower in the EEA group (24.13 +/- 3.16 kg/m(2) vs. 26.79 +/- 4.5 kg/m(2), P=0.079), and the preoperative body mass index was comparable between groups. Similar prevalences of overweight/obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and metabolic syndrome were detected in the 2 groups. Moreover, no significant differences were observed in the rates of cerebrospinal fluid leakage and intracranial infection between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: EEA may provide the same gross total resection rate for craniopharyngioma as TCA while providing better protection of anterior pituitary function.

AB BACKGROUND: We explored the clinical effect of one-stage posterior debridement and bone grafting with internal fixation for the treatment of monosegmental thoracolumbar tuberculosis (TB).
   METHODS: The data from 90 patients with thoracolumbar TB, who had undergone one-stage posterior debridement and bone grafting with internal fixation, were retrospectively reviewed. Data on the operative time, blood loss, length of hospital stay, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, improvement of neurological function, visual analog scale score, vertebral Cobb angle, bone healing, and complications were collected.
   RESULTS: A total of 88 patients were finally included in the present retrospective study, included 42 men and 46 women. The mean patient age was 45.4 +/- 12.3 years (range, 27-70), and the mean duration of disease until treatment was 11 +/- 4.5 months (range, 3-19). The mean operative time was 167.0 minutes (range, 130-210), and the mean blood loss was 767.4 mL (range, 500-1150). At the final follow-up examination, the correction in the Cobb angle was 19 degrees, the visual analog scale score had decreased to 3 +/- 1.72, the neurologic deficits using the Frankel grade had improved, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level had returned to normal levels.
   CONCLUSION: One-stage posterior debridement and bone grafting with internal fixation might be a better choice for treating patients with monosegment thoracolumbar TB.

DT Article
DE Apoptosis; CELF2; Glioma; MicroRNA; Migration; Proliferation
ID CANCER; METASTASIS; MANAGEMENT
AB OBJECTIVE: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that play important roles in tumor development and progression. miR-20a acts as an oncogene in many cancers; however, the underlying role of miR-20a in human glioma remains unknown.
   METHODS: Glioma tissue samples were obtained from 32 patients with primary glioma who had undergone surgery at the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China). Twenty-two normal brain tissue samples used as controls were obtained by internal decompression in patients who had undergone surgery for cerebral injury and cerebral hemorrhage at the same hospital.
   RESULTS: Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed upregulation of miR-20a in glioma tissues and cell lines compared with normal brain tissue and normal human astrocytes. Functional assays showed that miR-20a promotes proliferation and invasion and inhibits apoptosis in glioma cells. The bioinformatic analysis showed that CELF2 (CUGBP Elav-like family member 2) is a direct target gene of miR-20a, which was confirmed using a luciferase reporter assay. Downregulation of CELF2 reversed the effects of inhibiting miR-20a expression.
   CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results suggest a critical role for miR-20a in glioma cell apoptosis, proliferation, and invasion via the direct targeting of CELF2 and indicate its potential application in cancer therapy.

ID QUALITY-OF-LIFE; SURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE: Patients' expectations are considered to play an important role in subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS). We explored the relationship among expectations, satisfaction, and outcome 6 years after surgery.
   METHODS: Fifteen patients with Parkinson disease (9 males, mean age 60.5 +/- 6.4 years) undergoing STN DBS completed a modified PDQ-39 questionnaire (incorporating an assessment of patients' expected changes in addition to the standard quality of life items) preoperatively and at 6 years postoperatively. A satisfaction questionnaire accompanied the postoperative questionnaire.
   RESULTS: At 6 years' follow-up, PDQ-39 scores were unchanged from preoperative scores except in the stigma domain, which showed significant improvement. There was no significant difference between the postoperatively rated expected PDQ-39 summary score and the postoperative actual PDQ-39 summary score. However, there was a significant difference between the preoperatively rated expected PDQ-39 summary score and the postoperative actual PDQ-39 summary score. Patients remained highly satisfied with the outcome of surgery (mean satisfaction score 83%). Satisfaction did not correlate with PDQ-39 summary scores, domain scores, or fulfilment of expectations. The more satisfied patients (satisfaction >= 80%) changed their expectations so that their postoperatively rated expectations reflected a less favorable condition, whereas no such change was seen in the less satisfied (satisfaction < 80%) patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients remain highly satisfied with STN DBS 6 years after surgery, although quality of life assessed by the PDQ-39 may return to baseline levels. Patients' expectations change over time and may influence patient satisfaction. Managing expectations before and after surgery plays an essential role in STN DBS.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze treatment of microvascular decompression using the retrosigmoid approach (RA) in primary trigeminal neuralgia and hemifacial spasm using preoperative images combined with intraoperative microscopic navigation to avoid unnecessarily opening the mastoid air cells (MACs).
   METHODS: Ten patients with primary trigeminal neuralgia and 20 patients with hemifacial spasm (test group) were treated using RA for microvascular decompression. Preoperative head magnetic resonance angiography and temporal bone computed tomography were performed and the images registered using SPM12 and fused with MRI-cron to determine the relationship between MACs and sigmoid sinuses. An O-arm was used for navigation, and the transverse sigmoid sinus was projected under a microscope to guide RA. A control group comprised 139 patients who had the same surgical procedure as the test group but without image processing or intraoperative navigation.
   RESULTS: The relationship between MACs and the ipsilateral sigmoid sinus was classified as follows: I, MACs did not exceed the lateral edge of the ipsilateral sigmoid sinus (10/60); II, MACs exceeded the ipsilateral lateral edge of the sigmoid sinus but did not exceed the medial edge (42/60); and III, MACs exceeded the medial edge of the ipsilateral sigmoid sinus (8/60). Test and control groups showed significant differences in the incidences of opening MACs (P=0.003). There was no cerebrospinal fluid leakage or scalp and intracranial infection at follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Image processing and intraoperative microscopic navigation can avoid unnecessarily opening MACs and might reduce postoperative cerebrospinal leakage and scalp infection after RA craniotomy.

AB BACKGROUND: Thoracic vertebral fracture repair after a traumatic injury can be associated with significant risk for postoperative complications. Surgical outcomes are further complicated by patient comorbidity, particularly diabetes mellitus. This study compared outcomes and complication rates for traumatic thoracic vertebral fracture repair in a matched sample of patients with diabetes and nondiabetic control subjects.
   METHODS: Patients with a surgical repair of a traumainduced thoracic vertebral fracture treated from 2010 to 2015 were identified from the Trauma Quality Improvement Program database, yielding 5557 cases. Patients with comorbid diabetes were matched by propensity score matching (PSM) with patients without diabetes on age, race, and body type and were compared by postoperative complications and clinical outcomes.
   RESULTS: Prior to PSM, the diabetes group was older on average and had a greater proportion of patients who were obese (Ps < 0.001). After PSM, each group consisted of 544 patients (N = 1088) and no longer differed by any baseline characteristic. Comorbid diabetes was associated with longer average length of hospital stay and greater frequency of several major and minor postoperative complications (Ps < 0.05), including prolonged intensive care, pneumonia, acute renal failure, stroke, pressure ulcers, and urinary tract infections, but no differences were found in reoperation rates or in-hospital mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes comorbidity can significantly increase the risk of postoperative complications after traumatic thoracic vertebral fracture repair, which may lead to delayed recovery and greater health careerelated costs. This finding is an important consideration for surgical decision-making and patient counseling on treatment options with this comorbid condition.

AB BACKGROUND: Hemimetameric segmental shift (HMMS) is defined as >= 2 contralateral hemivertebrae (HV) that are separated by at least 1 normal vertebra. Theoretically, the 2 HV tend to balance each other to produce minor spine deformities. However, curve progression has still been observed in HMMS. No research has yet specifically studied its surgical treatment. This study aimed to report efficacy of HV resection for HMMS.
   METHODS: From 2009 to 2015, 15 patients (5 male and 10 female) with HMMS underwent HV resection in our department. Average age at the time of surgery was 10.5 +/- 4.7 years, and mean length of follow-up was 38.5 +/- 7.1 months. Clinical outcomes and related complications were assessed by reviewing the medical records, operative notes, radiographic data, and scores on the Scoliosis Research Society-22 questionnaire.
   RESULTS: The segmental curve was 45.1 degrees +/- 10.6 degrees preoperatively, 14.3 degrees +/- 7.8 degrees postoperatively, and 15.3 degrees +/- 7.6 degrees at the latest follow-up. The cranial compensatory curve was 17.1 degrees +/- 11.9 degrees, 8.9 degrees +/- 6.3 degrees, and 7.8 degrees +/- 6.5 degrees. The caudal compensatory curve was 12.0 degrees +/- 11.0 degrees, 4.5 degrees +/- 4.8 degrees, and 4.3 degrees +/- 5.0 degrees. Spinal balance was significantly improved in both coronal and sagittal planes and remained stable until the latest followup. Three domains of the Scoliosis Research Society-22 questionnaire, including general self-image, mental health, and satisfaction, were significantly improved at the latest follow-up compared with preoperative status.
   CONCLUSIONS: HV resection is a safe and effective treatment for HMMS that causes progressive or severe deformity.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of fixation to pelvis on 30-day outcomes after posterior spinal fusions in pediatric spine deformities.
   METHODS: The 2012-2016 American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program pediatric database was queried using Current Procedural Terminology codes for patients undergoing posterior spinal fusions (22800, 22802, and 22804). Patients undergoing concurrent anterior fusion/combined fusion and anterior-only fusions were removed from the study. Patients undergoing additional fixation to pelvis were identified by code 22848.
   RESULTS: Of a total of 13,398 patients, 1092 (8.2%) patients underwent a fixation to the pelvis. After adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics, patients undergoing fixation to pelvis had a longer length of stay (odds ratio [OR] 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.48]), greater odds of any 30-day complication (OR 1.26; CI 1.03-1.55), pneumonia (OR 1.85; CI 1.26-2.70), renal insufficiency (OR 6.87; CI 2.02-23.40), acute renal failure (OR 14.23; CI 2.36-84.51), urinary tract infection (OR 1.99; CI 1.23-3.23), cardiac arrest (OR 2.98; CI 1.10-8.06), sepsis (OR 2.25; CI 1.35-3.74), bleeding (OR 1.51; CI 1.25-1.82), 30-day read-missions (OR 1.39; CI 1.07-1.81), and 30-day reoperations (OR 1.37; CI 1.06-1.76).
   CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to adult spinal deformity literature, pediatric patients undergoing a fixation to pelvis are at a greater risk of experiencing adverse outcomes within 30 days of surgery. Providers should use these data for preoperative counseling and/or risk-stratification to improve quality-of-care in the acute postoperative period in these patients.

   VARIABILITY; HESS; HUNT
AB BACKGROUND: Several outcome prediction systems have been developed to evaluate aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). However, they can be difficult to use and can contain subjective elements. We sought to identify the predictors of aSAH outcomes at discharge to provide an accurate and reliable scoring system.
   METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients with aSAH at an academic institution from 2007 to 2016 was conducted. The primary outcome measure was the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at discharge, with mRS scores of 0-2 considered favorable and mRS scores of 3-6 considered unfavorable. Factors significant on multivariate regression were used to develop a scale, which was compared with other established grading systems using receiver operating characteristic curves.
   RESULTS: We identified 279 patients with aSAH, 37.3% of whom had unfavorable outcomes. The proposed scale assigns 2 points for postresuscitation Glasgow coma scale score of <= 8, 1 point for age >= 70 years, 1 for antiplatelet therapy on admission, and 1 for SAH thickness of >= 10 mm, with a total score of 0-5. The proposed, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage International Trialists, and Hunt and Hess scales had similar areas under the curve (85.2%, 84.8%, and 80.6%, respectively; P > 0.05) but were significantly better than the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (78.5%; P = 0.001) and modified Fisher (60.8%; P < 0.001) scales.
   CONCLUSION: We propose a grading scale to predict discharge mortality and functional outcomes in patients with aSAH. The proposed scale outperformed most other outcome prediction scales. The proposed scale contains objective elements, is easy to apply by memory, and can be a useful and effective measure to predict aSAH outcomes.

ID ASYMPTOMATIC MENINGIOMAS; NATURAL-HISTORY
AB OBJECTIVE: Both stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and fractionated radiation therapy (FRT) techniques are used for treatment of intracranial meningiomas with excellent local control (LC) rates. Although SRS techniques are convenient, toxicity including treatment-related edema can significantly impact patient quality of life. The long-term clinical outcomes of patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-defined meningiomas treated with radiation therapy (RT) alone are reported.
   METHODS: The charts of 211 patients with meningiomas diagnosed by contrast-enhanced MRI treated with either SRS or FRT between 1991 and 2012 at a single institution were reviewed. Actuarial rates for LC and development of treatment-related radiographic edema (TRE) were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method.
   RESULTS: There were 211 patients who received radiation therapy for 223 lesions. Median follow-up was 5.7 years. Eleven patients experienced a local failure; of these, 2 were ultimately found to have pathologically proven metastatic carcinoma. Two-and 5-year LC was 97.8% and 94.6%, respectively, with no significant difference based on modality of therapy. Actuarial rate for development of TRE at 1 and 2 years was 30.1% and 34.6% for the SRS group and 1.6% and 2.5% for the FRT group, respectively (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: RT alone using a limited margin is an effective treatment option for MRI-defined meningiomas and should be considered even without biopsy if surgery will present significant morbidity. Although LC with SRS versus FRT was comparable, FRT was associated with a significantly decreased risk of TRE.

AB BACKGROUND: Although posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) has provided satisfactory clinical outcomes, adjacent segment disease (ASD) is one of the most important complications affecting long-term results. However, according to ASD studies, few have described repeat surgery. The purpose of this study was to elucidate incidence, time period, and clinical features of multiplerepeated ASD after PLIF.
   METHODS: Subjects comprised 1112 consecutive patients (502 men, 610 women) who underwent 1-level PLIF for degenerative lumbar diseases. The mean age of patients was 66 years (range, 15-89). The mean follow-up period was 6.4 years (range, 0.5-21.1). The incidence and the time period of multiple-repeated ASD were investigated. To elucidate clinical features of the multiple-repeated ASD, all 4 cases were shown as the case description including radiographic parameters.
   RESULTS: Four (0.4%) developed multiple-repeated ASD: 3 women and 1 man. Primary PLIF was performed at L3-4 in 1 patient and at L4-5 in 3 patients. Two patients underwent adjacent segment decompression simultaneously. All patients required at least 3 additional surgeries due to newly occurred ASD after each PLIF. All patients developed iatrogenic flatback as ASD was repeated. As a result, corrective surgeries were required (thoracolumbar, 2; spinopelvic, 2).
   CONCLUSIONS: Multiple-repeated ASD was observed in 0.4% of the patients. All patients developed iatrogenic flatback as a result of repeated ASD, and corrective surgeries were required for these patients.

ID EXPRESSION; TISSUE
AB BACKGROUND: Coagulation is an important aspect of the vascular microenvironment in which brain tumors evolve. Patients with tumor often show aberrant coagulation and fibrinolysis activation. In particular, glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive primary brain tumor, is associated with a state of hypercoagulability, and venous thromboembolism is a common complication of this cancer and its treatment. Our study aims to investigate the clinical and prognostic significance of routine laboratory tests to assess the coagulative state of patients with brain tumors, to identify potential new prognostic factors and targets for personalized therapy.
   METHODS: Blood samples were collected from patients with GBM (n = 58) and patients with meningioma (MNG, n = 22), before any treatment. The parameters analyzed were prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), D dimer (DD), fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor (VWF), leukocyte count, and hemoglobin levels.
   RESULTS: Plasma levels of PT and aPTT were significantly reduced in GBMs compared with MNGs (P < 0.05), whereas DD, VWF: Ag levels, and leukocyte count were significantly higher in GBMs than in MNGs (P < 0.01). Furthermore, we observed that patients with GBM with reduced PT and aPTT and high levels of DD and VWF, defined as hypercoagulable patients, showed reduced overall survival (P < 0.05) compared with nonhypercoagulable patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the assumption that patients with GBM show a plasma hypercoagulable profile and that coagulation profile is related to adverse outcome in patients with GBM. If confirmed, hypercoagulability could play an important role as a prognostic factor of the disease and in the decision of an antithrombotic prophylaxis.

AB BACKGROUND: Stent retrievers (SRs) can be used to perform mechanical thrombectomy for the treatment of acute major arterial occlusion. Recanalization is faster, and outcomes are better with treatment involving these devices than with internal treatment. Although several SRs are available, their clot-capturing abilities are unclear. Therefore in the present study, we numerically evaluated the clot-capturing abilities of SRs in an experimental vascular model.
   METHODS: A sham clot (urethane foam) was fixed with sutures at the middle of a vascular model (polyvinyl chloride tube). One end of the tube was connected to a measuring instrument. From the other end, an SR was inserted and deployed over the sham clot. The delivery wire of the stent was then withdrawn at a constant velocity using an automatic withdrawal machine. The maximum frictional force before the stent left the clot was measured. Five stents (Trevo ProVue [2 sizes], Revive, and Solitaire [2 sizes]) and three stent-deployment techniques (standard, push-and-fluff, and wire-push techniques) were evaluated.
   RESULTS: The clot-capturing ability (maximum withdrawing force [N: newton]) was greater for large-diameter stents than for small-diameter stents (mean 0.39 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.56 +/- 0.18). For Trevo and Revive, the clot-capturing ability was highest with the push and fluff technique (mean 0.43 +/- 0.05). For Solitaire, the ability was the highest with the simple wire-push technique (mean 0.705 +/- 0.16).
   CONCLUSIONS: We successfully numerically evaluated the clot-capturing abilities of SRs. The clot-capturing ability differed among SRs and among stent-deployment techniques.

ID NATURAL-HISTORY; MANAGEMENT
AB OBJECTIVE: Quality of life is an important factor in the decision making for the treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA). The data dealing with QoL in patients after the treatment are spare. We have evaluated QoL of patients after endovascular or surgical treatment of incidental intracranial aneurysm.
   METHODS: We performed a prospective analysis of retrospectively collected data. All patients received 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), German questionnaire for self-perceived deficits in attention (FEDA) and not standardized questionnaire analyzing personal job-related situation, family circumstances and chronic illnesses.
   RESULTS: 177 patients were treated during the evaluated period. 79 (44.6%) patients responded. In this cohort, 62.03% of patients underwent coiling. Complications were noted in 13.9% of patients. Stroke was the most common complication (7.6%). All SF-36 related data except for pain showed significant lower mean, if compared to the standard German population (p < 0.01). For both genders, anxiety (males, P = 0.003 and females, P = 0.002) but not depression was more common than in the standard population. According to the FEDA test, treated patients showed significant difference only for fatigue in comparison to healthy population (P < 0.001). 54.4% of patients suffered from chronic illnesses, and among them only 1 patient (1.3%) had aneurysm associated chronic disease. No significant differences were found between treatment modalities.
   CONCLUSIONS: The risk for depression and pain is not significantly increased after elective treatment of UIA. According to our results, decreased QoL is common in this cohort of patients but often related to factors not associated with aneurysm treatment.

   COMBINATION
AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the combined effects of a decompressive craniectomy and prolonged selective brain hypothermia on large hemispheric infarction in a rat model.
   METHODS: Permanent middle cerebral artery infarction using an endovascular occlusion technique was created in rats assigned to 4 groups. Normothermia was maintained without a craniectomy in group A (n = 20) as the control, prolonged (> 44 hours), selective brain hypothermic treatment was performed on group B (n = 20), a craniectomy was performed on group C (n = 18), and prolonged, selective brain hypothermic treatment using a cooling coil implanted in the craniectomy site was combined with a craniectomy for group D (n = 18).
   RESULTS: Group B and C exhibited a significantly reduced infarct volume when compared with the control. Furthermore, group D showed a significantly reduced infarct volume when compared with group C, plus a significantly improved neurologic score. These results for group D were associated with an increased neuronal cell count and reduced hyperactive microglia and hypertrophic astrocytes in the cortical penumbra (P < 0.01). Moreover, a greater preservation of normal-appearing axonal bundles and the bloodebrain barrier was observed in the core infarct region at the caudoputamen.
   CONCLUSIONS: A decompressive craniectomy reduced the infarct volume and improved the neurologic outcomes in a rat model of middle cerebral artery infarction. Furthermore, when combined with prolonged selective brain hypothermia, significant additional benefits were observed for the neurologic outcomes, infarct volume, and degree of neuroinflammation.

   Index; Spine surgery
ID H-INDEX; SCHOLARLY IMPACT; NEUROSURGERY; ASSOCIATION
AB OBJECTIVE: Spinal surgery is taught and practiced within 2 different surgical disciplines, neurological surgery and orthopedic surgery. We have provided a unified analysis of academic productivity measured using the h-index attributable to spine-focused faculty at U.S. residency programs.
   METHODS: A total of 278 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education training programs were assessed to identify 923 full-time faculty members with a spinal surgery designation, as defined by spine fellowship training or case volume > 75% in spine surgery. The faculty were assessed with respect to academic rank, duration of practice in years, and academic productivity (h-index).
   RESULTS: The comparison showed a significantly greater mean h-index for neurological spine surgeons. The mean h-index for both disciplines increased significantly as faculty rank increased. Within the academic ranks of assistant and associate professor, neurological spine surgeons had significantly greater mean h-indexes. Neurological spine surgeons had a significantly lower practice duration. At all ranks except for assistant professor, the mean practice duration was not significantly different statistically between the neurological spine and orthopedic spine surgeons. A positive correlation between the h-index and practice duration was found for both spine surgical disciplines. The proportional odds models for neurological and orthopedic spine surgeons were moderately successful at predicting faculty rank according to the h-index.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present a unified view of academic productivity as measured by the h-index among neurosurgical and orthopedic surgery spine faculty, with some noticeable differences. These results can be used for benchmark purposes to assess the relative productivity of its faculty and could be of interest to those pursuing academic opportunities in spine surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: To report the establishment of a new center for deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a surgical treatment for Parkinson disease and the surgical outcomes, from 2014 to 2017 in Shiraz, Southern Iran.
   METHODS: A new treatment program was established in Shiraz through a multidisciplinary team in 2014. Thirty-four patients underwent implantation of subthalamic nucleus (STN) electrodes during the last 3 years. Twenty-five patients fulfilled the minimum 6-month follow-up criteria. The baseline Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) was assessed 1 month before surgery in both off-medication and on-medication states by a movement disorder neurologist. To evaluate the outcomes, subscores of the UPDRS were assessed in all patients before surgery and at least 6 months after the operation.
   RESULTS: All 25 patients had advanced Parkinson disease categorized as stage 3 or 4 using the Hoehn and Yahr scale. STN DBS resulted in a dramatic improvement in motor function of most patients. A reduction in dopaminergic medication dosage (average 60% reduction) was observed. The mean improvement was 40% in UPDRS II and 67% in UPDRS III. No surgical or hardware complications were observed. Stimulation-related adverse effects, including increased falling and worsening of speech, occurred in a few patients after surgery. Most of the patients experienced weight gain after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral STN DBS is a satisfactory and safe treatment for carefully selected patients with advanced Parkinson disease. According to the results, the procedure can be performed safely and with comparable results in developing countries around the world.

DE Carotid endarterectomy; Carotid stenosis; Cognitive impairment;
   Neuropsychometric assessment
ID NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION; MANAGEMENT; DECLINE; ABSENCE; STROKE
AB BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is an effective treatment for the prevention of stroke in patients with carotid artery stenosis. We aimed to clarify the incidence and risk factors for early cognitive dysfunction (eCD) and early cognitive improvement (eCI), defined as change in cognitive performance <= 24 hours after surgery, using a battery of neuropsychometric tests.
   METHODS: In total, 585 patients undergoing CEA were tested with neuropsychometric tests before and after surgery; 155 patients undergoing "simple" spine surgery were the reference group. Patient performance for each test was evaluated by z scores. Cognitive change was defined as eCD (or eCI) if: 1) patients had a z score <= -2 (or >= 2) in >= 2 cognitive domains or 2) patients had mean z scores across all domains <= -1.5 (or >= 1.5). Associations between the categorical cognitive outcomes and variables of interest were modeled using the proportional odds model.
   RESULTS: Of the 585 subjects, 24% had eCD, 6% had eCI, and 70% had "no change." Patients who had eCD were more likely to be statin naive (odds ratio [OR] 1.23 [1.03-1.48], P [0.02) or women (OR 1.27 [1.06-1.53], P = 0.02). Those with eCI were less likely to have less formal education (OR 0.95 [0.90-1.00], P = 0.04) and less likely to have diabetes mellitus (OR 0.8 [0.65-0.99], P = 0.04).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients having CEA may develop eCD or eCI postoperatively. Medications likely to be associated with less eCD are statins and aspirin, which correlate most strongly in asymptomatic patients. In addition to confirming previous findings, we found that women were more likely than men to develop eCD. More sex-specific studies and analysis are needed to better explore these findings.

AB OBJECTIVE: Currently, radiologic predictors for the resectability of cervical dumbbell schwannomas remain unknown. To identify radiologic predictors for resectability, we retrospectively reviewed data from 72 patients.
   METHODS: From January 1995 to June 2017, 72 patients who underwent surgical treatment for cervical dumbbell schwannomas were enrolled. We focused on the relationship between preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features and the extent of tumor removal. The MRI features evaluated were tumor size, tumor level, Eden classification, degree of vertebral artery (VA) involvement, and signal intensity (SI) on T2-weighted images (WIs).
   RESULTS: Among the 72 patients, gross total resection (GTR) and subtotal resection (STR) were achieved in 37 (51.4%) and 35 (48.6%) patients, respectively. Mean maximal tumor size (P = 0.011), mean size of foraminal and extraforaminal portion (P = 0.017), tumor level (P < 0.001), VA involvement (P < 0.001), and SI on T2-WIs (P = 0.006) were significantly different between the GTR and STR groups. Univariate analyses demonstrated that maximal tumor size (odds ratio [OR]: 0.93, P = 0.012), high cervical level (OR: 11.37, P < 0.001), pushed VA (OR: 0.11, P = 0.002), encased VA (OR: 0.02, P < 0.001), and hyper-SI on T2-WIs (OR: 12.46, P = 0.020) were significant predictors for GTR. In the multivariate analysis, only high cervical level (OR: 5.48, P = 0.033) and encased VA (OR: 0.07, P = 0.014) were significant predictors for GTR.
   CONCLUSIONS: The resectability of cervical dumbbell schwannomas may be predicted by MRI features, including tumor size, tumor level, and degree of VA involvement.

AB OBJECTIVE: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) frequently results in severe morbidity, even mortality. Hypothermia is known to have a neuroprotective effect in ischemic injuries. The aim of this study was to determine whether nasopharyngeal (NP) perfluorochemical (PFC) cooling could be used in a rat model of SAH model for neuroprotection.
   METHODS: SAH was induced in 16 male SpragueDawley rats by cisterna magna injection of 0.3 mL autologous blood. Vital signs, temperatures, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and brain histology were assessed. Brain cooling was performed on the treatment group using the NP-PFC method starting from 20 minutes after SAH.
   RESULTS: No SAH-related deaths were observed in either group. SAH caused an immediate decrease in mean arterial pressure (17.0% +/- 4.90% below baseline values). SAH induction caused a significant and rapid decrease in CBF from baseline (approximately -65%, ranging from -32% to -85%) in both hemispheres. In the left hemisphere, cooling facilitated the return of CBF to baseline values within 20 minutes of treatment with further increase in CBF that stabilized by the 2 hours after injury time point. Quantitative immunohistochemistry showed that there were significantly more NeuN-positive cells in the cortex and significantly fewer IBA-1-positive microglia and glial fibrillary acidic proteinepositive astrocytes cells in both cortex and hippocampus in the animals that received NP-PFC cooling compared with no treatment, reflecting preserved neuronal integrity and reduced inflammation.
   CONCLUSIONS: The data from this study indicate that local hypothermia by NP-PFC cooling supports return of CBF and neuronal integrity and suppresses the inflammatory response in SAH, suggestive of a promising neuroprotective approach in management of SAH.

TI Retroclival Arachnoid Cysts: Case Series, Literature Review, and New
   Classification Proposal

AB BACKGROUND: The retroclival region is among the rarest locations for an arachnoid cyst (AC), with only a few reported cases. No accepted classification system is available for these rare cysts. Such a classification system would solve the nomenclature problem and could result in easier and more systematic management. We reviewed and analyzed data from databases and reported studies of retroclival ACs (RACs) and have proposed a classification system.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of RACs was conducted in Marmara and Adiyaman University Hospitals, Turkey. Cysts in the prepontine and/or premedullary cisterns that spared the chiasmatic cistern were included. Additionally, the reported data were searched for relevant studies on cysts. The findings were analyzed to establish a clear nomenclature and classification system, and the clinical presentations, treatment strategies, and surgical approaches were reviewed.
   RESULTS: We identified 1 adult and 1 pediatric patient, and only the adult had undergone surgery. Additional data searches yielded 14 patients with RACs. The cysts were classified as type 1 if they had extended superiorly beyond the borders of the diencephalic leaf of the Liliequist membrane. If they had not extended, they were classified as type 2. Finally, type 2 cysts that had extended to the anterior spinal cistern were classified as type 3.
   CONCLUSIONS: RACs can be more easily and systematically managed using a simple clinical classification system. Together with the previously proposed suprasellar AC classification, our proposed RAC classification should be adequate to classify all ACs in the ventral midline cistern, which could solve the nomenclature problem.

   technique; Motor and sensory outcomes
ID TRANSPSOAS APPROACH; NERVE INJURY
AB OBJECTIVE: To discuss lessons learned from an initial lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) experience with a focus on evolving surgical technique, complication avoidance, and new motor and sensory outcomes after implementation of a modified surgical approach.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected series of all patients undergoing LLIF by the senior author (A.D.L.) from January 2010 to January 2018 after implementation of a modified surgical mini-open technique, compared with previously reported institutional results with the originally recommended percutaneous technique. LLIF-specific complications examined included groin/thigh sensory dysfunction, flank bulge/pseudohernia, psoas-pattern weakness, and femoral nerve injury.
   RESULTS: The incidence (19%, n = 98 patients) of groin/thigh sensory dysfunction in our cohort was significantly lower than that of the historical control (60%, n = 59) (P < 0.0001). The incidence of abdominal flank bulge/pseudohernia (2.0%, n = 98 patients) in our cohort was improved but not significantly lower than that of the historical control (4.2%, n = 118) (P = 0.36). The incidence of psoas-pattern weakness (3.1%, n = 98) in our cohort was significantly lower than that of the historical control (23.7%, n = 59) (P = 0.0001). The incidence of femoral nerve injury (0%, n = 98 patients) in our cohort was improved but was not significantly lower than that of the historical control (1.7%, n = 118) (P = 0.20).
   CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of an exclusive mini-open muscle-splitting approach with first-look inspection of the lumbosacral plexus nerve elements may improve motor and sensory outcomes in general and the incidence of postoperative groin/thigh sensory dysfunction and psoas-pattern weakness in particular.

AB BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurologic disorders and often remains refractory despite pharmacologic treatment. In patients who are not amenable to surgical resection of seizure foci, vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) may be beneficial. Multiple case series have attempted to construct a risk profile for VNS, but they are largely confined to pediatric or single-center populations. We aimed to compile a risk profile for adults undergoing VNS, using multicenter patient data from an international database.
   METHODS: The 30-day outcomes of adults undergoing VNS from 2005 to 2016 were collected from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Readmission rates, reoperation rates, length of hospital stay, operative time, and complications were assessed. A comprehensive literature search was performed to identify historically reported complication rates.
   RESULTS: Inclusion and exclusion criteria were met by 77 patients. A 30-day risk profile revealed low readmission (6.2%), reoperation (1.3%), and postoperative infection (1.3%) rates. Mean operative time was 81.7 minutes, and average length of stay was 0.27 days. Most (87.0%) patients were discharged on the day of operation.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a current snapshot of risks and outcomes in VNS, revealing a safe 30-day risk profile. Greater use of VNS may be beneficial in this fragile population.

   DIFFERENTIATION; DIAGNOSIS; SURVIVAL; MRI
AB BACKGROUND: Ancillary criteria to identify tumor recurrence such as the McDonald criteria or Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria can provide false diagnoses. Magnetic resonance perfusion (MRP) imaging has been proposed to differentiate post-treatment changes from recurrence. We investigated the utility of MRP to quantify the histological fraction of active tumor (AT), treatment-related changes, and radiation necrosis in recurrent post-treatment intracranial tumors.
   METHODS: We conducted an exploratory single-blind study of patients with intracranial glioblastoma or metastases with previous radiation therapy and MRP before surgery. Biopsy specimens (n = 19) were analyzed for the percentage of AT, radiation necrosis, and treatment effect. Nonparametric Spearman's rho analysis and multivariable analysis of covariance were performed to assess the correlation between quantitative MRP and AT histological fraction.
   RESULTS: The mean patient age was 58 +/- 11.5 years. The mean relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were 1.33 +/- 0.71 and 1.34 +/- 0.73, respectively. On analysis of covariance, significant associations were identified between increased rCBF (P = 0.0004) and increased rCBV (P = 0.007) and percentage of AT. A significant interaction was identified between rCBF and rCBV and tumor histological features (glioblastoma vs. metastases; P = 0.003 and P = 0.03, respectively). An rCBF > 1 predicted a mean AT fraction of >= 53% for all intracranial tumors and 74% for glioblastoma.
   CONCLUSION: MRP can help quantitatively predict tumor recurrence and/or progression for glioblastomas. The AT histological fraction correlated with quantitative radiologic measurements, including rCBV and rCBF. For metastases, MRP might not be as useful in predicting the AT fraction. Clinicians must be judicious with their use of MRP in predicting tumor recurrence and radiation necrosis.

AB INTRODUCTION: In several situations, the stability of the subaxial cervical spine is damaged and involves the lateral mass of 1 side; in these cases, a pedicle screw (PS) or lateral mass screw (LMS) may not be suitable for placement on the affected side. Therefore, salvage shortsegment fixation with satisfactory stability is needed when bilateral fixation is not feasible.
   METHODS: Seven fresh-frozen human cervical spine specimens were used to test the 3-plane range of motion (ROM) of the C4-C5 segment. Quasistatic 2-Nm flexibility testing was performed in the following sequence: 1) intact; 2) destabilization (using 3-column injury models) treated with bilateral mass screws (BMSs); 3) destabilization treated with a unilateral PS combined with a contralateral translaminar screw (UPSDCTLS); and 4) destabilization treated with bilateral PSs (BPSs). Then, a pullout strength test was performed for the PSs, LMSs, and translaminar screws (TLSs) using 7 isolated C4 and C5 vertebrae.
   RESULTS: The UPSDCTLS group showed no significant difference from the BMS group in the 3-plane ROM or from the BPS group in the axial rotation or flexion-extension ROM but showed a significantly greater lateral bending ROM than did the BPS group. The pullout strength test showed that both C4 and C5 TLSs had strength similar to that of LMSs but poorer than that of PSs.
   CONCLUSIONS: Fixation with the hybrid UPSDCTLS construct performed as well as BMS fixation in our biomechanical tests and may play a clinical role when BPS or BMS placement is not feasible for short-segment fixation.

AB BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterized by increased intracranial pressure. IIH causes significant morbidity marked by incapacitating headaches and visual disturbances. This study investigated the long-term outcomes of venous sinus stenting in a large group of patients with IIH.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients at our institution who underwent venous sinus stenting for IIH over 6 years (July 1, 2012-June 30, 2018). A particular focus was dedicated to collecting demographic, clinical, radiologic, and outcomes data. All patients had failed medical management.
   RESULTS: Of the 110 patients evaluated for IIH, 42 underwent venous sinus stenting, with a mean follow-up of 25.6 months (range, 8.7-60.7 months). The mean age was 32 years (range, 15-52 years), 38 (90%) were women, and the mean body mass index was 35.6 kg/m(2) (range, 18.6-47.5 kg/m(2)). Prior to the stenting procedure, all patients had headaches, visual disturbances, and papilledema. Of the 39 patients who had an ophthalmologic evaluation poststenting, 29 (74%) had resolution of their papilledema. Eighteen patients (43%) had complete resolution of their headaches after the stenting procedure, whereas 22 patients (52%) remained under a neurologist's care for chronic migraine and other types of headaches. Two patients underwent a restenting procedure for disease progression, and 1 patient experienced an in-stent thrombosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary approach involving neurosurgeons, ophthalmologists, radiologists, and neurologists is integral in the management of patients with IIH to prevent the complications of papilledema. Venous sinus stenting offers a safe and effective means of treating IIH.

AB INTRODUCTION: With the introduction into the neurosurgical practice of minimally invasive methods using endoscopic techniques, it became possible to effectively remove hard-to-reach tumors, including central tumors of the anterior region of the posterior cranial fossa.
   OBJECTIVE: To analyze the results of surgical treatment of patients with various centrally located tumors of the base of the skull that extend into the anterior region of the posterior cranial fossa using the endoscopic endonasal transclival approach.
   METHODS: The personal surgical experience of the first author is 136 patients with various tumors (e.g., chordomas, meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, and fibrous dysplasia).
   RESULTS: Radicality of tumor removal was total 61.03%; subtotal 25%; partial 13.23%; and insufficient removal 0.74%. Postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leaks occurred in 9 cases (6.62%) and meningitis in 13 cases (9.56%). In 2 cases, surgical treatment had a lethal outcome (1.47%).
   CONCLUSIONS: The endoscopic endonasal transclival approach can be used to obtain access to centrally located skull base tumors. This approach allows for a radical and low-risk removal of various skull base tumors of central localization that, until recently, were considered to be almost inoperable.

DE Cerebral aneurysm; Hemiparesis; Outcomes; Subarachnoid hemorrhage
ID SEIZURES; ONSET; COMMITTEE; VASOSPASM; SCALE
AB OBJECTIVE: The presence of hemiparesis on arrival in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is presumed to affect prognosis; intracranial hematomas with mass effect responsible for hemiparesis are frequently observed in these patients. The aim of this study was to clarify characteristics and outcomes of patients who presented with hemiparesis on arrival with no responsible hematomas (hemiparesis without hematoma) having mass effect demonstrated on computed tomography.
   METHODS: Consecutive patients with SAH treated with surgery for ruptured cerebral aneurysms within 5 days of onset between 2003 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS: Hemiparesis without hematoma was present in 25 of 858 surgically treated patients (2.9%). Internal carotid artery aneurysms were significantly more common in patients with hemiparesis without hematoma than in the other patients (P < 0.05). In 19 of 21 surviving patients (90.5%) with hemiparesis without hematoma on arrival, the hemiparesis improved at discharge. Favorable outcomes were achieved in 16 of 25 patients with hemiparesis without hematoma (64%) and in 13 of 59 patients with hemiparesis with hematomas (22.0%); this difference was significant (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Hemiparesis can be expected to improve in patients with SAH with hemiparesis without hematoma, and such patients appear to have a better prognosis than patients with SAH with hemiparesis and responsible hematomas. A possible major mechanism of hemiparesis without hematoma based on the characteristics identified is a combination of transient ipsilateral hemispheric functional failure caused by the impact of aneurysmal rupture and transient ischemia of the perforators originating from the internal carotid artery.

TI A Practical Cadaveric Model for Intracranial Bypass Training
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Cadaver; Intracranial bypass; Microanastomosis; Simulation; Training
ID ANASTOMOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial bypass is technically challenging and difficult to learn owing to its relative rarity and complexity. Although multiple training models for intracranial bypass exist, a detailed depiction of the use and fidelity of cadaveric specimens for bypass training is lacking in the literature. This study describes use of preserved cadaveric specimens as a practical training model for performance of multiple intracranial bypasses and discusses the surgical setup for a cadaveric bypass laboratory.
   METHODS: Using a cadaveric specimen and basic microneurosurgical instruments and supplies, 5 intracranial bypasses were performed (superficial temporal artery [STA]-to-middle cerebral artery [MCA], MCA-to-MCA, STA-to-posterior cerebral artery [PCA], anterior cerebral artery-to-anterior cerebral artery, and posterior inferior cerebellar artery-to-posterior inferior cerebellar artery) using pterional, subtemporal, interhemispheric, and suboccipital approach. Bypass integrity was assessed by direct fluid injection into the adjacent vessel segment. All procedures were recorded.
   RESULTS: Procedural steps mirrored actual bypass surgery and included vessel marking, performance of arteriotomy, and completion of an end-to-end, end-to-side, or side-to-side anastomosis. Simulations included anatomically appropriate exposures of common intracranial (MCA, PCA, posterior inferior cerebellar artery, anterior cerebral artery) and extracranial (STA) vessels encountered during cerebral bypass surgery and high-fidelity recreations of the operative corridors associated with deeper anastomoses, such as STA-to-PCA bypass. Vessel diameters were 1.5-2.1 mm, and anastomosis times were 20-40 minutes. Immediate feedback on anastomotic integrity was achieved via direct fluid injection adjacent to the anastomosis site.
   CONCLUSIONS: The cadaveric specimen trainee model is a relatively simple yet high-fidelity approach for learning intracranial bypass.

AB BACKGROUND: The increasing frequency of elderly patients with severe tortuous anatomy, especially when combined with fibromuscular dysplasia, can make intracranial canalization severely difficult or impossible. Computed tomography angiography was used to determine the feasibility of accessing the internal carotid artery (ICA) via a percutaneous translacerum approach.
   METHODS: Twenty consecutive stroke activations with CT angiography were reconstructed in three-dimensional models to take measurements to assess if currently available technologies could safely provide access. We assessed the diameter of the foramen lacerum and ICA. Entry points and angulations were measured based on trajectory. Our trajectory was based on anatomic observations that provided a safe corridor from the angle of the jaw to the foramen lacerum.
   RESULTS: Based on the 40 carotid arteries from 20 patients, 77.5% had a large enough foramen lacerum to provide access to the ICA. Although there were no traversals of the pharynx, we noted a 20% traversal of the eustachian tube and 5% traversal of a small maxillary artery branch. There was no large-vessel traversal by the trajectory. All patients with bilateral stenotic foramen lacerum were African-American women; 44% of African-American women had bilateral stenotic foramen lacerum. The diameter of the ICA and foramen lacerum would not be prohibitive of sheath placement in patients without stenosis with adequate canalized length of sheath necessary for stability.
   CONCLUSIONS: Access of the ICA via the foramen lacerum can be safely performed with currently available technologies.

AB OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord injuries generate the most negative response to medical treatment among all general body injuries. This important morbidity is thought to be caused by a complex secondary damage mechanism. In the present study, we examined the neuroprotective effects of alemtuzumab in a spinal cord trauma model.
   METHODS: We divided 24 Long-Evans male rats into 4 groups (n = 6 per group). Laminectomy was performed at T5-T8 in all groups. Trauma was applied using the Yasargil temporary aneurysm clip for 60 seconds at these spinal cord levels in all groups, except for group 1. Next, 1 mg/kg of alemtuzumab was administered to each rat in groups 3 and 4. A functional evaluation was performed on days 1, 3, and 5 in groups 1, 2, and 4, and the rats were then sacrificed. The rats in group 3 were sacrificed on the third postoperative day to observe the early effects of alemtuzumab. The biochemical examination findings of malondialdehyde and glutathione in plasma and tissue samples and histopathological findings of the spinal cord were evaluated and compared by statistical analysis.
   RESULTS: The inflammatory findings in the trauma group were not seen in either group treated with alemtuzumab. The clinical motor examination and inclined plane test results were also significantly better in these groups.
   CONCLUSION: Our results have shown that alemtuzumab might prevent spinal cord injury after trauma and is a histopathologically and biochemically strong antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective agent.

AB OBJECTIVE: In lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis (DSL), the criteria and extent of surgical treatment have not been strictly defined owing to the adjacent segment disease theory and unclear molecular pathogenesis. The present study analyzed the clinical and radiographic findings of patients after lower lumbar fusion surgery with single and 2-level DSL and explored the inflammatory mediator's role in DSL evolution and symptoms.
   METHODS: The prospective follow-up of patients with DSL, stratified by the stabilization extent (L4-L5, L5-S1, and L4-S1), included the Back Illness Pain and Disability 9-item questionnaire and native and dynamic radiographs to evaluate the intervertebral disc height and adjacent segments' angular motion. Follow-up examinations were performed at 3, 12, and 24 months. The pathological cytokine concentrations in the intervertebral disc and facet joints of the subchondral bone were assessed using the BioPlex assay in perioperatively collected patient samples and compared with those of control subjects obtained during multiorgan procurement. These findings were correlated with pain localization and severity.
   RESULTS: Statistical analysis of the questionnaire data revealed significant postoperative improvement in all patients, in particular, the L4-L5 group. Also, we found radiographic evidence of angular motion reduction in both adjacent segments near the limits of statistical significance and a meaningful correlation with subjective status improvement at 24 months. BioPlex analysis revealed platelet-derived growth factor 2 B subunits, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were elevated in spinal unit segments and the interleukin-1 beta levels correlated significantly with the intensity of low backache.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings did not support the adjacent segment disease theory. However, later development of these changes could not be excluded. The cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors play a significant role in DSL pathogenesis and symptoms.

AB BACKGROUND: Traditional wound closure techniques include skin sutures and metal clips. Cyanoacrylate has good neovascularization, epithelialization, and antimicrobial activity properties and a fast application procedure. This study presents our long-term experience.
   METHODS: We retrospectively selected 362 patients who underwent brain surgery from January 2007 to March 2017. Exclusion criteria were applied for repeat surgeries, emergency/posttraumatic procedures, wound infections, wounds longer than 16 cm, skull base cases, and postoperative patients who stayed in the intensive care unit more than 1 day. We collected data from 250 cases of supratentorial procedures and 112 cases of infratentorial procedures. The median wound length was 11 cm (range, 4-15 cm); the median age was 51 years. We followed-up all patients for 1, 3, and 12 months focusing on wound complications, cosmetic results, based on the Hollander Wound Evaluation Scale (HWES), and patient satisfaction using a visual analog scale.
   RESULTS: Cosmetic results were very good (HWES score of 5-6) in 99.5% of cases at 12 months. Patient satisfaction reached almost 100% at 12 months. We experienced 2 cases of wound dehiscence and 2 others with poor cosmetic results. The main complaint was a feeling of discomfort, during the first 2 weeks after surgery, because of the dried glue along the wound's edges.
   CONCLUSIONS: With additional research, we can confirm that cyanoacrylate glue may be a valid and useful alternative to traditional techniques for wound closure in brain surgery, carrying several advantages. However, a randomized controlled trial with a large number of patients is warranted to confirm our findings.

AB OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis and treatment of intracranial hypotension associated with a spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, especially in comatose patients, have yet to be established.
   METHODS: Clinical manifestations, neuroimaging findings, and treatment outcomes in 11 patients (Glasgow Coma Scale score 10 +/- 4) were described and compared with 36 patients with normal consciousness.
   RESULTS: Patients with disturbed consciousness were diagnosed at a significantly older age (55 +/- 11 years; P < 0.001) than those without (42 +/- 8.8 years). Neuroimaging findings in patients with disturbed consciousness were characterized by a smaller midbrainepons angle (7.8 +/- 10 degrees; P < 0.001), brainstem swelling (122%; P = 0.002), and thicker subdural hematomas (16 +/ 7.0 mm degrees; P < 0.001). Epidural blood patch (EBP) alone did not achieve sustained improvements in patients with disturbed consciousness but did in most patients without (94%; P = 0.001). Over the treatment course, 5 patients progressed to coma, which correlated with a high signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in the brainstem. Hematoma drainage before EBP caused neurologic deterioration in 2 patients. Simultaneous EBP after hematoma drainage achieved sustained improvements in 5 of 6 patients. Simultaneous microsurgical dural repair after hematoma drainage achieved more rapid improvements in 3 of 3 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with intracranial hypotension caused by a spinal CSF leak, disturbed consciousness may occur in elderly patients because of severe diencephalic-mesencephalic deformities. Simultaneous EBP after safe hematoma drainage is indicated for these patients. Alternatively, dural repair is indicated for patients for whom the spinal level of dural disease has been identified. Hematoma drainage before EBP is not recommended because it caused deterioration.

   SURGERY; CONCURRENT SERIES; SPACE; MACROADENOMAS; EFFICACY
AB BACKGROUND: The amount of parasellar extension is a known limitation for gross total resection (GTR) of pituitary adenomas. Endoscopic technique seems to improve resection of adenomas extending laterally. Knosp classification is used to evaluate the extent of parasellar invasion: increasing Knosp grades correspond with lower rates of GTR. The 4-quadrant method could help to estimate the risk of partial resection in adenomas with parasellar extension. The objective of this study was to compare the rate of GTR between microsurgical and endoscopic techniques in pituitary adenomas with parasellar extension. The secondary aim was to compare the predictive value of Knosp classification and of the 4-quadrant classification regarding GTR.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective comparison of GTR in different Knosp grades and per quadrant in 55 consecutive patients who underwent microsurgical (n = 28, 2001-2008) or endoscopic (n = 27, 2008-2016) resection of a pituitary adenoma with parasellar extension.
   RESULTS: The endoscopic group (19/27 patients) had a significant higher rate of GTR than the microsurgical group (8/28 patients) (P = 0.005). This was evident in all patients but those with Knosp grade 4. Using the quadrant classification, the endoscopic group had a significantly higher rate of GTR than the microsurgical group in all but the inferolateral quadrant. The 2 classifications showed similar sensitivity in predicting subtotal resection (78% quadrant vs. 82% Knosp), with limited specificity (both 25%).
   CONCLUSIONS: GTR of macroadenomas with parasellar extension is significantly enhanced by the endoscopic approach. The 4-quadrant classification appears as sensitive as the Knosp classification and could be a simple adjunct to predict surgical radicality, in particular in cases of inferolateral quadrant invasion.

AB OBJECTIVE: Evidence is lacking concerning the myriad surgical techniques for type 1 Chiari malformation. This study evaluated the impact of arachnoid violation with tonsil thermocoagulation during surgical craniovertebral junction decompression.
   METHODS: The evaluation included aspects of the neurologic examination and parameters of cerebrospinal fluid flow on magnetic resonance imaging during preoperative and postoperative periods. All patients underwent craniovertebral junction decompression and opening of the dura mater. Patients were divided into 2 study groups. Patients in group 1 did not undergo arachnoid violation. Patients in group 2 underwent tonsil manipulation and systematic opening of the fourth ventricle outlet.
   RESULTS: There were 16 patients enrolled in each group (total of 32 patients). Regarding clinical improvement, there were no significant differences between groups in the postoperative period. Group 2 had more adverse events (relative risk 2.45, 95% confidence interval 1.55-3.86). In terms of cerebrospinal fluid flow parameter analyses, patients in group 1 achieved better results (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: For treatment of symptomatic type 1 Chiari malformation, craniovertebral junction decompression with arachnoid preservation (i.e., without tonsillar manipulation) seems more suitable than the addition of arachnoid opening and thermocoagulation of the tonsils.

AB BACKGROUND: Delayed cerebral infarction after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) still remains the leading cause of disability in patients that survive the initial ictus. It has been shown that computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging can detect hypoperfused brain areas. The aim of this study was to evaluate if a single acute CTP examination at time of neurologic deterioration is sufficient or if an additional baseline CTP increases diagnostic accuracy.
   METHODS: Retrospective analysis of acute and baseline (within 24 hours after aneurysm treatment) CTP examinations of patients with neurologic deterioration because of vasospasm-related hypoperfusion. Patients without clinical deterioration during the vasospasm period served as control subjects. The following CTP parameters were analyzed for predefined brain regions: time to drain (TTD), mean transit time, time to peak, cerebral blood flow, and volume.
   RESULTS: Thirty-three patients with and 23 without neurologic deterioration were included. Baseline CTP examination did not ameliorate diagnostic accuracy of the acute CTP examination in symptomatic patients. The same was true for interhemispheric comparison of perfusion parameters of the acute examination. The CTP parameter with the highest diagnostic yield was TTD of the symptomatic brain region (threshold value, 4.7 seconds; sensitivity, 97%; specificity, 96%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Acute CTP examination in case of suspected vasospasm-induced neurologic deterioration after aSAH has the highest diagnostic accuracy to detect misery perfusion. Additional baseline CTP is not needed. The most sensitive parameter to detect critically perfused brain areas is TTD.

   SAFETY
AB BACKGROUND: The Scepter XC balloon catheter can be used for balloon-assisted coiling (BAC) of cerebral aneurysms but also accommodates delivery of a low-profile visible intraluminal stent (LVIS Jr.). We assessed the safety and effectiveness of BAC using the Scepter XC, with LVIS Jr. stent-assisted coiling (SAC) as a bailout option.
   METHODS: A single-institution prospectively maintained neurointerventional database was reviewed for wide-necked (neck width >= 4 mm or dome/neck ratio < 2) saccular aneurysms treated using the Scepter XC. Complication and angiographic occlusion rates of BAC and SAC procedures were compared. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify variables predictive of complete aneurysm occlusion.
   RESULTS: The cohort included 141 wide-necked saccular intracranial aneurysms treated in 135 procedures. SAC was used to treat 30% of aneurysms by deploying the LVIS Jr. through the Scepter XC. The overall procedural complication rate was 8.9%, including a 1.5% rate of symptomatic thromboembolic events and 3.0% rate of hemorrhagic complications, with no significant differences in complications between BAC and SAC procedures (P = 0.27). The overall complete or near-complete aneurysm occlusion rate was 96%, with trends toward higher complete aneurysm occlusion and lower retreatment rates with SAC (78 vs. 57%; P = 0.13; 0 vs. 8.4%, P = 0.13). Multivariate logistic regression identified aneurysm size, procedure technique (BAC or SAC), and duration of follow-up as independent predictors of complete aneurysm occlusion.
   CONCLUSIONS: Use of the Scepter XC for BAC, with LVIS Jr. SAC as a bailout option, shows acceptable angiographic and clinical results.

AB OBJECTIVE: Unfamiliarity with the morphometry of the assimilated C1 lateral mass (C1LM) could make screw placement dangerous. In the present study, we defined the morphometric dimensions of the occipitalized C1LM to provide surgeons with valuable information for preoperative planning.
   METHODS: Thin-slice computed tomography scanning data from 131 patients with occipitalization of the atlas (OA) and 50 control cases were imported into Mimics software for analysis. The widths and heights of the C1LM were fully measured in the different planes. The ideal inward angulation and the safe maximum cephalic angulation of C1 screw trajectory were evaluated.
   RESULTS: Except for the medial height, all the widths and heights of C1LM were significantly shorter in the OA group than those in the control group. The ideal inward angle (alpha) was significantly larger in the OA group (23.8 degrees +/- 8.3 degrees) than that (15.3 degrees +/- 3.8 degrees) in the control group; the corresponding screw length was also significantly longer in the OA group (20.9 +/- 2.9 mm). The safe maximum cephalic angles (beta) of the screw trajectory did not reach a significant difference between the 2 groups. All the widths and heights were shorter in the females than those in the males. The a angle also did not reach a significant difference between the sexes; however, the b angles in the males (35.9 degrees +/- 10.4 degrees) was significantly larger than that in the females (32.0 degrees +/- 9.4 degrees).
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the hypoplastic C1LM brings limitations to screw insertion to some extent, it is still broad enough to accommodate a screw safely in both female and male patients. Considering the irregularity of the C1LM in patients with OA, the preoperative imaging assessment is critical, and C1LM screw placement should be performed individually.

ID SUBSEQUENT RISK; EPIDEMIOLOGY; BURDEN
AB BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been reported as a risk factor for the development of brain tumors. However, whether TBI affects systemic cancer remains to be determined. We investigated the incidence and factors associated with cancer development in patients with TBI.
   METHODS: A propensity score (age, gender, and comorbidity)-matched longitudinal cohort study of 34,556 patients with pre-existing TBI and 69,112 patients without TBI from January 2000 to December 2015 was presented using the Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio of developing cancer adjusted by the potential confounding factors. The stratified analysis of age, gender, and comorbidities for each cancer type was evaluated using forest plot analysis
   RESULTS: The cancer incidence rate in the patients with TBI (4.38%) was greater than that in patients without TBI (3.88%). The interval to cancer development in those with TBI (5.65 +/- 3.58 years) was shorter than that in those without TBI (6.02 +/- 3.65 years). The cancer risk in those with TBI was increased 1.27-fold compared with that in the general population. Of the patients with TBI, age < 55 years and male gender indicated a greater incidence of cancer than that of the general population. The patients with TBI had greater cancer frequencies in the head and neck structures compared with those in the general population.
   CONCLUSIONS: TBI is a risk factor for cancer development, especially in males and those aged < 55 years. We hope this information will remind physicians to consider the long-term effects of TBI on cancer development.

AB OBJECTIVE: Obesity has become a worldwide epidemic, with very few long-term successful treatment options for refractory disease. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the bilateral lateral hypothalamus (LH) in refractory obesity has been performed safely. However, questions remain regarding the optimal settings and its effects on metabolic rate. The goals of our experiment were to determine the optimal DBS settings and the actual effect of optimal stimulation on energy expenditure.
   METHODS: After bilateral LH DBS implantation, 2 subjects with treatment refractory obesity underwent 4 days of metabolic testing. The subjects slept overnight in a respiratory chamber to measure their baseline sleep energy expenditure, followed by 4 consecutive days of resting metabolic rate (RMR) testing at different stimulation settings. On day 4, the optimized DBS settings were used, and sleep energy expenditure was measured again overnight in the room calorimeter.
   RESULTS: During daily testing, the RMR fluctuated acutely with changes in stimulation settings and returned to baseline immediately after turning off the stimulation. Optimal stimulation settings selected for participants showed a 20% and 16% increase in RMR for the 2 participants. Overnight sleep energy expenditure measurements at these optimized settings on day 4 yielded a 10.4% and 4.8% increase over the baseline measurements for the 2 participants.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings have demonstrated the efficacy of optimized DBS of the LH on increasing the RMR acutely and maintaining this increase during overnight sleep. These promising preliminary findings have laid the groundwork for the possible treatment of refractory obesity with DBS.

AB OBJECTIVE: Keyhole craniotomy is a minimally invasive approach for the treatment of middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcome between supraorbital keyhole approach and pterional keyhole approach (PKA) in Chinese patients with MCA aneurysm.
   METHODS: Consecutive patients with MCA aneurysms were reviewed between January 2013 and December 2017. Efficacy and safety between PKA and supraorbital keyhole approach were compared. Poor outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 3-6 at discharge.
   RESULTS: This study enrolled 260 patients; 222 (85.4%) had ruptured aneurysm, and 183 (70.4%) received PKA. The distribution of PKA in unruptured and ruptured aneurysms showed no significant difference (P > 0.05). In subgroup analyses, PKA was more likely associated with poor outcome at discharge in patients with unruptured aneurysms (odds ratio = 5.500, 95% confidence interval = 1.013-29.850, P = 0.048), whereas approach selection was not an independent factor predicting poor outcome in patients with ruptured aneurysms (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: In a Chinese population, supraorbital keyhole approach was superior to PKA in improving outcome in patients with unruptured MCA aneurysms, but the 2 approaches showed comparable outcomes at discharge in patients with ruptured aneurysms.

ID CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS; EEG; PREDICTS; SEIZURES; CHILDREN
AB OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the possible predictive factors and longitudinal change in long-term surgical outcome after refractory frontal lobe epilepsy surgery.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 82 patients who underwent frontal lobe resection. Invasive monitoring was performed in 43 patients. All patients were followed-up for a minimum of 3 years after surgery. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the predictors. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed the estimated probability of complete seizure freedom, and a favorable outcome was defined as Engel class I at the last follow-up.
   RESULTS: The estimated probability of complete seizure freedom was 57.3% at 1 year postoperatively, 51.2% at 2 years, and 50.0% at 5 years. Factors predictive of worse long-term outcome were lack of a lesion in the frontal lobe on magnetic resonance imaging, generalized/nonlocalized ictal discharge, use of subdural grids, and acute postoperative seizure (APOS). After the surgery, 44 patients (53.7%) had seizures at any time during the first 2 years. Five of 44 patients had seizure freedom at the last follow-up. After a seizure-free period of at least 6 months, seizure recurred in 6 patients by 6 months to 1 year (early recurrence) and in 9 patients by 1-3 years (late recurrence). Eight of 43 (18.6%) seizure-free patients had discontinued drugs.
   CONCLUSIONS: The overall seizure outcome after surgery changed most during the first 2 years. The presence of frontal focal lesions and ictal frontal rhythm predicted favorable outcome. However, APOS was predictive of early epilepsy recurrence.

   METHODS: From January 2008 to December 2014, 44 patients with TSDAVFs were treated endovascularly at our institution. The clinical and angiographic data were retrospectively collected, and the occlusion rate, complications, and clinical outcomes were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Overall, 44 patients (26 males and 18 females) were identified, with a mean age of 47 years (range, 13-68 years). Of the 44 patients, 5 presented with Cognard type I fistula, 12 with type IIa, 6 with type IIb, 13 with type IIaDIIb, 2 with type III, and 6 with type IV. Complete (n = 29) or nearcomplete (n = 7) occlusion of the fistula was achieved in 36 patients (82%). Two patients experienced a transient neurological deficit (cranial nerve VII). In 31 patients with angiographic follow-up (range, 2-40 months) data available, the occlusion remained in 25, 2 previously minimal residual fistulas were completely occluded, 3 residual fistulas were unchanged, and 1 fistula recurred. Two patients with cortical venous reflux who had received incomplete treatment died of intracranial hemorrhage during the followup period. Of the 37 patients with clinical follow-up (mean, 33.6 months) data available, clinical cure was achieved in 29, residual symptoms remained unchanged in 7, and symptoms had deteriorated in 1.
   CONCLUSIONS: Favorable and durable outcomes were achieved with endovascular treatment of TSDAVFs. TSDAVFs with cortical venous reflux carry a high risk of hemorrhage and require curative treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: Ewing's sarcoma family tumors (ESFTs) are the second most common malignancy in children and adolescents. The purpose of the present retrospective study was to evaluate the prognostic role of inflammatory biomarkers and preoperative D-dimer levels in patients with spinal ESFTs.
   METHODS: The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, platelet/lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte/monocyte ratio, albumin/globulin ratio, C-reactive protein/albumin ratio (CAR), preoperative D-dimer level, and clinical parameters were evaluated and analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were performed using the log-rank test and Cox regression analysis, respectively. The DFS and OS rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Nomograms were established to predict DFS and OS quantitatively.
   RESULTS: The optimal cutoff values for D-dimer, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, platelet/lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte/monocyte ratio, CAR, and albumin/globulin ratio were 0.3, 3.2, 168, 2.2, 1.5, and 1.4, respectively. The patients were stratified into 2 groups according to the cutoff values. Multivariate analysis revealed that age, resection mode, and D-dimer level were favorable prognostic factors for DFS and OS (P < 0.05). Metastasis and CAR < 1.5 were significantly associated with OS (P < 0.05). Nomograms with all significant factors were established to predict DFS and OS.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results have indicated that the preoperative D-dimer level is an effective prognostic factor with discriminatory ability for DFS and OS, superior to other indicators. Also, CAR was favorable prognostic factor for OS. Nomograms of DFS and OS can be recommended as practical models to evaluate the prognosis for patients with spinal ESFTs.

DE Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma; Plasma soluble interleukin-2
   receptor; Random skin biopsies
ID MANAGEMENT
AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate effectiveness of random skin biopsies for intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) with or without central nervous system (CNS) involvement.
   METHODS: Data from 21 patients with suspected IVLBCL (7 with CNS involvement and 14 without CNS involvement) who underwent single (4 patients), double (1 patient), and random (16 patients) skin biopsies were retrospectively analyzed.
   RESULTS: IVLBCL was diagnosed in 16 patients (including 6 with CNS involvement). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of random skin biopsies were 75%, 100%, and 100%. Ratio of tumor-positive biopsy samples to plasma soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) values was significantly correlated in cases with data on both variables. sIL-2R values in the 6 tumor-negative skin samples (median, 1415 U/mL; range, 487-3200 U/mL) were significantly lower than in tumor-positive skin samples (median, 3550 U/mL; range, 595-8700 U/mL) with at least 1 skin specimen obtained. Mean ratio of tumor-positive biopsy samples in IVLBCL cases with low sIL-2R (< 3000 U/mL) was only 45%, indicating a requirement for 3-site multiple sampling. No differences in median sIL-2 values between cases of IVLBCL with and without CNS involvement were found (2795 U/mL vs. 3550 U/mL). Steroids administered before diagnosis yielded false-negative results in 3 of 5 IVLBCL cases (all false-negative cases were IVLBCL with CNS involvement), whereas none of 11 IVLBCL cases without steroid administration yielded false-negative results.
   CONCLUSIONS: Random skin biopsies before brain biopsy are recommended in patients with suspected IVLBCL regardless of CNS involvement, but low sIL-2R values and steroids may yield false-negative results.

TI Measurement of Cervical Sagittal Alignment Parameters on X-Ray Films of

DT Article
DE Cervical alignment; Cobb angle; Endplate; Measurement
ID T1 SLOPE; BALANCE; AGE
AB OBJECTIVE: The Cobb angle between the lower endplate of C2 and C7 (C2L-C7L angle) is a traditional parameter used for the assessment of the cervical alignment. However, when the lower cervical column is masked by the shoulder, measurements are difficult. In the present study, we inspected 191 X-ray films, measured the Cobb angle between C2L and the endplates at the several levels of the lower cervical column, and assessed their usefulness of such measurements for the determination of cervical sagittal alignment.
   METHODS: We obtained X-ray films on 191 patients ranging in age from 20 to 93 years. The Cobb angle between C2L and the C7 upper (C7U), the C6 lower (C6L), the C6 upper (C6U), and the C5 lower endplate (C5L) was measured and compared with the C2L-C7L angle.
   RESULTS: C7L was identified in 116 of 191 patients (60.7%). Except for C2L-C7U angle (P = 0.55), the difference in the mean between C2L-C7L angle and the angle between C2L and the other endplates was statistically significant (P < 0.05). There was a very strong correlation between C2L-C7L angle and C2L-C7U angle (r = 0.99), C2L-C6L angle (r = 0.96), C2L-C6U angle (r = 0.94), and C2L-C5L angle (r = 0.86).
   CONCLUSIONS: To measure the C2L-C7L angle on unclear X-ray films, C7U can be substituted for C7L. Our measurement data for the C6 and C5 endplates were statistically different; however, the correlation between the C2L-C7L angle and C2L-C6U angle, C2L-C6L angle or C2L-C5L angle was very strong. In patients with unclear lower vertebral bodies, cervical sagittal alignment can be predicted by using adjacent endplates.

AB OBJECTIVE: Referring to the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) traversing a cerebellopontine angle tumor during retrosigmoid vestibular schwannoma (VS) removal as a challenging AICA (c-AICA), we describe incidence, anatomic characteristics, mechanism of development of c-AICA, and surgical techniques used to remove VS while preserving the AICA.
   METHODS: Review of surgical records and videos of 150 patients who underwent retrosigmoid VS removal revealed 10 patients (7%) with c-AICAs. Retrospective analysis of these 10 patients was performed.
   RESULTS: Surgical findings classified c-AICAs as c-AICAs with subarcuate artery (SAA) and c-AICAs without SAA. In c-AICAs with SAA (7/10), the SAA had an anchoring effect in the development of the c-AICA. The most challenging c-AICAs (i.e., c-AICAs reaching the porus acusticus, entering the internal auditory canal, and adhering to the dura) were associated with short cisternal SAAs (4/7). We preserved the most challenging c-AICA with the surrounding dura by drilling the posterior wall to preserve the posterior wall dura. AICAs adhering to the porus acusticus dura were not associated with long cisternal SAAs. Sacrificing the SAA caused no neurologic deficits. c-AICAs were preserved in all patients, and tumors were removed with no complications related to AICAs.
   CONCLUSIONS: c-AICAs occur more often than expected. The anatomy of the SAA is related to the development and characteristics of c-AICAs. Although preserving a c-AICA is challenging and necessitates a complex dissecting technique, understanding of anatomic characteristics and appropriate surgical management of c-AICAs enable VS removal while preserving the AICA.

AB OBJECTIVE: We studied the postoperative morphology of the dura mater and analyzed the probability of epidural hematoma (EH) after anterior controllable antedisplacement and fusion (ACAF).
   METHODS: A total of 63 patients with a diagnosis of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) and degenerative kyphosis and stenosis (DKS) had undergone ACAF from 2016 to 2017. All these patients had undergone cervical plain films, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The operation duration, blood loss, and hospital stay were estimated. Radiological assessments included the occupying rate, OPLL type and extent, kyphotic angle, decompression width, and postoperative area of the spinal canal. On sagittal MRI, the postoperative morphology of dura mater was observed. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association scoring system was used to evaluate neurological status. EH and other surgery-related complications were recorded.
   RESULTS: Of the 63 patients, 39 had OPLL and 24 had DKS. All the patients were followed up for 3-18 months (average, 12.5). The mean decompression width and postoperative spinal canal area were 18.7 +/- 1.1 mm and 167.7 +/- 34.6 mm(2) in the OPLL group and 17.9 +/- 0.9 mm and 263.1 +/- 46.9 mm(2) in the DKS group, respectively. On sagittal MRI, the dura mater was classified into 4 types according to its morphology (dune, ladder, wave, and mixed type), protecting the spinal cord as would a suspensory tent. No patient presented with EH. The mean postoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association score at the last follow-up examination was significantly better than preoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The dura mater can protect the spinal cord like a suspensory tent after ACAF. The occurrence of EH is rare when ACAF is used to treat OPLL and DKS.

AB BACKGROUND: Prescription opioid medications negatively affect postoperative outcomes after lumbar spine surgery. Furthermore, opioid-related overdose death rates in the United States increased by 200% between 2000 and 2014. Thus, alternatives are imperative. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a mind-body therapy, has been associated with improved activity and mood in opioidusing patients with chronic pain. This study assessed whether preoperative MBSR is an effective adjunct to standard postoperative care in adult patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery for degenerative disease.
   METHODS: The intervention group underwent a preoperative online MBSR course. The comparison group was matched retrospectively in a 1: 1 ratio by age, sex, type of surgery, and preoperative opioid use. Prescription opioid use during hospital admission and at 30 days postoperatively were compared with preoperative use. Thirty-day postoperative patient-reported outcomes for pain, disability, and quality of life were compared with preoperative patient-reported outcomes. Dose-response effect of mindfulness courses was assessed using Mindful Attention Awareness Scale scores.
   RESULTS: In this pilot study, 24 participants were included in each group. Most intervention patients (70.83%) completed 1 session, and the mean Mindful Attention Awareness Scale score was 4.28 +/- 0.71 during hospital admission. At 30 days, mean visual analog scale back pain score was lower in the intervention group (P = 0.004) but other patient-reported outcomes did not differ.
   CONCLUSIONS: During hospital admission, no significant dose-response effect of mindfulness techniques was found. At 30 days postoperatively, MBSR use was associated with less back pain. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of preoperative MBSR on postoperative outcomes in lumbar spine surgery for degenerative disease.

AB OBJECTIVE: Among several novel predictors on non-contrast computed tomography (CT) for hematoma expansion in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), shape irregularity grade, satellite sign, and island sign are all related to irregular shape of hematoma. This study is aimed to compare the accuracy of these imaging markers for predicting hematoma expansion in the same cohort of sICH patients.
   METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled sICH patients who underwent diagnostic computed tomography (CT) scans within 6 hours after onset and another follow-up CT scan within 24 hours after initial CT scan. Shape irregularity grade, satellite sign, and island sign were assessed according to the definitions in previous studies. The accuracy of these imaging indicators for predicting hematoma expansion was analyzed using receiver operator analysis.
   RESULTS: Finally, a total of 196 patients were included. Shape irregularity grade >= 3 was found in 87 (44.39%) patients, satellite sign was identified in 76 (38.78%) patients, and island sign was shown in only 41 (20.92%) patients. Only island sign remained an independent predictor for hematoma expansion in multivariate logistic regression. The sensitivity values of shape irregularity grade >= 3, satellite sign, and island sign were 0.52, 0.63, and 0.48, respectively. By contrast, the specificity values of these 3 predictors were 0.58, 0.69, and 0.85, respectively. Shape irregularity grade >= 3 had the smallest area under the curve (0.597), and island sign had the largest (0.676).
   CONCLUSIONS: Island sign seems to be the optimal shape-related predictor for hematoma expansion in sICH patients and could be included in the future predictive model for hematoma expansion.

AB BACKGROUND: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the risk of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus among patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms treated with either coil placement or clipping.
   METHODS: A systematic literature search of Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library was performed to confirm relevant studies. The scientific literature was screened in accordance with the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. After quality assessment and data extraction from the eligible studies, a metaanalysis was conducted using the STATA 12.0 software (Stata corporation, College Station, Texas, USA).
   RESULTS: Thirteen studies met all inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. In total, these studies included 13,751 patients. Of the patients, 8444 of them underwent neurosurgical clipping, and 5307 underwent endovascular coiling. The overall result of a pooled estimate revealed there was no statistically significant risk of shunt dependency difference between the clipping and coiling groups (11.4% vs. 12.0%, respectively; relative risk [RR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval = CI], 0.84-1.01). Six prospective studies (n = 1373) reported shunt-dependent hydrocephalus revealed no significant difference between clipping and coiling (23.3% vs. 20.1%, respectively; RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.91-1.38). Seven retrospective studies (n=12,378) reported shunt-dependent hydrocephalus found statistical significance between the surgical and endovascular treatment groups (10.0% vs. 11.1%, respectively; RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79-0.98).
   CONCLUSIONS: Microsurgical clipping and endovascular coiling of ruptured cerebral aneurysms are associated with similar incidences of ventricular shunt placement for hydrocephalus. The risk of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus is not higher after coiling than after clipping of ruptured intracranial aneurysms.

AB BACKGROUND: Selection of anterior versus posterior surgery for multilevel (>= 3) cervical spondylotic myelopathy (MCSM) continues to be controversial. A comparison between anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with ROI-C cage and laminoplasty was made to determine the better treatment for MCSM.
   METHODS: Between 2012 and 2017, 57 patients received either ACDF with ROI-C or laminoplasty (LMP) treatment. Clinical and radiologic outcomes between the 2 groups were compared.
   RESULTS: In total, 24 patients underwent ACDF with ROIC cage (ACDF group) and 33 patients underwent LMP (LMP group). They were studied with a median follow-up of 22 months. Less operative blood loss (136.7 +/- 60.8 vs. 316.7 +/- 139.6 mL, P < 0.001) and a shorter hospital stay (7.8 +/- 1.6 vs. 9.9 +/- 3.3 days, P < 0.01) were notable for ACDF. The Japanese Orthopedic Association score showed that ACDF and LMP improved similarly (recovery rate, 55.3 +/- 19.2% vs. 58.9 +/- 18.1%, P > 0.05). Preoperative occupying rate and JOA score significantly affected the operation result (P < 0.01). The cervical lordosis, segmental cervical lordosis, and T1 slope were all larger in the ACDF group. The cervical range of motion decreased 10.6 degrees in the ACDF group and 4.8 degrees in the LMP group (P = 0.01). No significant differences were found between complication rates.
   CONCLUSIONS: ACDF with ROI-C cage has a similar clinical efficacy to LMP for patients with MCSM. There was less blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and improved sagittal balance when ACDF was used. However, a greater decrease in range of motion was observed after ACDF. Preoperative occupying ratio and Japanese Orthopaedic Association score are potential risk factors for different outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate hemodynamic stresses on anterior cerebral artery bifurcation apex and possible mechanism of the optimality principle in protecting bifurcation wall from supercharged hemodynamic stresses.
   METHODS: Three-dimensional angiographic datasets of 122 patients with anterior communicating artery (Acom) aneurysms, 21 patients with non-Acom aneurysms, and 220 control subjects with no aneurysms were used. Radii of parent (r(0)) and daughter branches (r(1) and r(2)) were measured, and bifurcations obeying the optimality principle required optimal caliber control of r(0)(n) = r(1)(n) + r(2)(n), with the junction exponent n approximating 3. Radius ratio = r(0)(3)/(r(1)(3) + r(2)(3)) and n were compared between aneurysmal and control bifurcations. Blood flow was simulated for analysis of hemodynamic stresses.
   RESULTS: Acom bifurcations in subjects without Acom aneurysms displayed optimal caliber radius, with mean radius ratio of 0.99 and n of 3.25, whereas Acom aneurysmal bifurcations had significantly lower radius ratio, 0.62 (P < 0.05), but higher n, 4.23 (P < 0.05). Peak wall shear stress and corresponding total pressure were significantly smaller for bifurcations obeying than disobeying the optimality principle (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). Total pressures in the direct impinging center, peak wall shear stress distance, and anterior cerebral artery bifurcation angle all were significantly smaller for bifurcations obeying than disobeying the optimality principle (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Normal anterior cerebral artery bifurcations obey the optimality principle whereas bifurcations with Acom aneurysms do not. Disobeying the optimality principle presents significantly enhanced hemodynamic stresses to possibly damage the bifurcation wall for aneurysm initiation.

AB OBJECTIVE: The present study compared the efficacy and safety of single-stage posterior instrumentation and unilateral transpedicular debridement with the traditional posterior operation for the treatment of thoracolumbar tuberculosis.
   METHODS: Of the 97 included patients, 53 had undergone posterior unilateral transpedicular debridement and pedicle screw fixation (group A) and 44 had undergone the traditional posterior operation (group B). We compared the outcomes, including correction of kyphosis (Cobb angle), bone fusion rate, visual analog scale score, Frankel classification, and short-form 12-item health survey between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: All patients obtained intervertebral bone fusion. The mean interval to bone graft fusion was 4.1 months (range, 3e8 months). The patients in the 2 groups showed significant improvement in kyphosis correction, short-form 12-item health survey score, and nerve function. In addition, single-stage posterior instrumentation and unilateral transpedicular debridement resulted in comparable clinical outcomes for the treatment of thoracolumbar tuberculosis. However, the patients experienced less trauma, greater spinal stability, and better functional recovery compared with the traditional posterior operation group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that single-stage posterior instrumentation and unilateral transpedicular debridement can be considered an effective and safe therapy for spinal tuberculosis with single-level and/ or bilevel segments.

DE Academic; Chair; Genealogy; Neurosurgery
ID NEUROLOGICAL SURGERY; UNIVERSITY; HISTORY; CLEVELAND
AB BACKGROUND: An academic genealogy describes mentoring relationships in an academic discipline. In this study, we outline an academic genealogy of neurosurgery department chairs in the United States beginning with the founding members of the field.
   METHODS: The biographic information provided by the Society for Neurological Surgery provided the basis for our genealogy. We also performed a literature review with PubMed using the term neurosurgery department history. Our data was manually uploaded to an online database called Academic Tree. Within this platform, mentor and trainee relationships were indicated to produce an academic genealogy.
   RESULTS: Our search yielded a total of 377 chairs and 368 mentoring relationships across 98 neurosurgery departments. The largest family tree in our academic genealogy was that of Harvey Cushing, with 177 department chairs. Harvey Cushing was also the individual who trained the most number of department chairs (22). The institution that trained the most department chairs was Brigham and Women's Hospital (26). Only 23.6% of department chairs completed residency training at the same institution where they became chair.
   CONCLUSIONS: The academic genealogy in this study allows for any neurosurgeon trained in the United States to put his or her training into historical context. It also provides a reference for bibliographic research to quantitatively describe the influence of individuals and institutions on the field.

AB OBJECTIVE: Upper cervical fixation with C2 pedicle screw insertion may predispose patients to vertebral artery injury, in particular, patients with craniovertebral junction anomalies. The aim of this study was to describe an alternative technique with trans-C2 inferior articular process screw (C2IAPS) insertion for rigid C2 fixation, which can be used to anchor the C2 vertebra for upper cervical fixation.
   METHODS: Records of 19 patients who underwent posterior atlantoaxial fixation using C2IAPS combined with C1 lateral mass screw were retrospectively reviewed. Efficacy was assessed by postoperative imaging and Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores.
   RESULTS: There were 22 C2IAPSs successfully implanted (3 on both sides and 16 on 1 side). With the exception of 2 screws that had intruded into the outlet of the intervertebral foramen, all screws were safely implanted. Average Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores improved from 11.8 +/- 1.9 preoperatively to 15.3 +/- 1.3 postoperatively. Bony fusion rate was 100%.
   CONCLUSIONS: For patients who are not eligible for C2 pedicle screw fixation, C2IAPS fixation can be considered as an alternative technique for upper cervical fixation of C2.

DT Article
DE Martini type Stirling engine; Free power piston; Thermodynamic and
   dynamic analysis; Flow friction
ID OPTIMIZATION; REGENERATOR; MODEL
AB In this study, a Martini type free piston Stirling engine concept is proposed and its performance analysis is conducted. The Martini engine consists of a heating-cooling unit and an expansion unit for working gas. The heating and cooling of the working gas is accomplished via displacing the gas between a hot and a cold volumes taking place in a displacer cylinder. The displacer is kinematically driven by a crank mechanism. The expansion of the working gas is accomplished via a power piston working in a separate cylinder. The power piston has no kinematic driving mechanism but one of its ends is adjusted to a mechanical spring while the other end is exposed to the gas pressure. The power piston bears an I type magnet at the center of itself. The expansion cylinder is equipped with a linear alternator to produce electricity. While the piston and the equipped magnet is performing a reciprocal motion in the expansion cylinder, the conductive wire coil wound around the expansion cylinder generates an electric current via using the work generated by the piston. The analysis conducted in this study involves the prediction of thermodynamic performance parameters of the engine as well as dynamic characteristics. The displacer is assumed to be driven by a crank mechanism turning with a constant speed and the motion of the displacer is defined kinematically. The motion of the power piston is defined with a differential equation obtained from the Newton law of motion. The flow friction of working fluid is calculated with Darcy equation. Variation of temperatures in nodal volumes are calculated with the first law of the thermodynamics given for unsteady open systems. Input parameters of the analysis were optimized for 2500 rpm engine speed. By introducing 1000 K hot end temperature, 400 K cold end temperature and very realistic values for the other inputs, the thermal efficiency of the Martini engine has been predicted as 20.6%. When the flow friction in the regenerator is ignored, the thermal efficiency increases from 20.6% to 21.5% and the cyclic work generation increases from 236.5 J to 254.8 J. For inputs optimized for 2500 rpm engine speed, the power output of the engine was predicted as about 10 kJ. When the regenerator heat transfer area was increased from 0.69 m(2) to 1.38 m(2), the thermal efficiency increased from 17.5% to 34.4%. However, further increase of regenerator heat transfer area was restricted by collusion between piston top and cylinder top. The Martini engine was found to be a useful supplementary device to couple with Internal Combustion Engines to increase the thermal efficiency of them. The thermal efficiency of the modified Internal Combustion Engine is expected to be 5% more than the non-modified engine.

AB Accurate wind speed forecasting plays a crucial role in wind power plants and wind systems. Numerous studies that dedicated to enhance wind speed forecasting accuracy have been proposed. Nevertheless, some classical models are not good at dealing with nonlinear time sequence, and artificial intelligence are easy fall into local optimum. Based on this, this paper proposed a novel combined model for wind speed forecasting, which combined hybrid models based on decomposition method and optimization algorithm. In this approach, four distinct hybrid models are proposed and to additionally enhance the forecasting performance, ESN (Echo state network) is initially applied to integrate all the results obtained by each hybrid model and achieve the ultimate forecasting results. Besides, a distinct data set division mechanism is adopted in the multi-step wind speed forecasting. To verify the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed combined model, the wind speed data of 20 m, 50 m, 80 m per minute of the M2 tower from the National Wind Power Technology Center, United States, are utilized as case studies. The experimental results indicate that the proposed combined model performs better than other conventional methods.

AB This paper presents a numerical study on the thermal-hydraulic and thermodynamic performance of a parabolic trough receiver with conical strip inserts. The effects of geometric parameters including central angle, hollow diameter, and pitch ratio on the performances are determined. The mass flow rate is found to vary in the range of 0.57-11.40 kg/s, with the corresponding Reynolds number ranging from 5000 to 791,000, which depends on the fluid inlet temperature. In the present study, four fluid inlet temperatures (400, 500, 600 and 650 K) are applied, and it is found that the heat transfer is effectively enhanced by the conical strip inserts, with the Nusselt number being enhanced 45-203%. Consequently, the temperature of the absorber tube and the heat loss are apparently reduced and the maximum reduction in heat loss is 82.1%. However, considerable increase in pressure loss penalty is also caused by the inserts, with the friction factor being 6.17-17.44 times that of the smooth parabolic trough receiver. Thus, the overall thermal-hydraulic performance (performance evaluation criteria) is ranged in 0.70-1.33, and the thermal efficiency is enhanced by 0.02-5.04%. In addition, Entropy and exergy analysis is carried out and it is found that for every given value of geometric parameters and fluid inlet temperature, there is a Reynolds number or mass flow rate below which the entropy generation rate is lower than that of the smooth parabolic trough receiver. The maximum reduction in entropy generation rate achieved in this study is 74.2% and the maximum enhancement in the exergetic efficiency is approximately 5.7%.

AB In this study, we investigated the comparative analysis of a solar-fuel cell hybrid system based on water and methanol electrolysis. The proposed system comprises PV, electrolyzer and proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The hybrid system is designed to supply the hydrogen (H-2) needed of the PEMFC system and also to fulfill the H-2 requirement of other applications. The actual data of solar irradiation of Izmir, Turkey are used in the simulation. The methanol and water electrolyzers were designed for 1.2 kW PEMFC H-2 demand which were met a house-hold energy requirement. Analyzes show that the use of the methanol electrolyzer can produce 27% more H-2 than the water electrolyzer. According to the study, it was determined that the methanol-based hybrid system offered a viable option for self-sustaining in household application.

AB Small commercial buildings in the United States consume 47% of the total primary energy of the buildings sector and, to save energy and mitigate the environmental impact of electricity consumption, distributed generation, involving renewable energy sources, might be a promising solution. In the present paper, a self-made simulation tool has been developed using Matlab/Simulink to model a stand-alone polygeneration power plant for a strip mall. A photovoltaic panel array has been coupled to a battery and a unitized regenerative polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell as primary storage/backup systems and a diesel generator as secondary backup system. The possibility of applying the same plant layout and control strategy to eight different climate zones in eight different States has then been assessed. Results show that even in the most favorable conditions in terms of daily radiation and average temperature, such as Miami, Las Vegas or Houston, the cost of electricity of the utility makes the implementation of these systems still inconvenient, unless a reduction in the initial investment costs of above 60% is pursued by means of incentives or a further establishment of the proposed technologies.

AB The chemical properties, pyrolysis behaviors and pyrolysis product distributions of Shenmu (SM) coal were investigated by proximate and ultimate analysis, thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) and Pyrolyzer coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The results of the proximate and ultimate analysis indicated that SM coal had less saturated aliphatic structures and more polar components. The coke yield for SM coal during pyrolysis process at 100 degrees C/min, 300 degrees C/min, and 500 degrees C/min was 65.60%, 64.19%, and 63.15%, respectively, which indicating that the increment in heating rates could promote the production of volatile substances. Moreover, there was a lateral shift to high temperature of TG/DTG curves when the heating rates increasing. The main volatile species detected from FTIR in the pyrolysis of SM coal were CO2, CO, CH4, C2H4, C2+ aliphatics, light arenes, C-O bond containing species and C=O bond containing species. Since the difference in the temperature intervals of those volatile species released, the sources of cleavage or chain scission during pyrolysis process were not the same. According to the fast pyrolysis by Py GC/MS, the volatile species could be divided into eleven species including alkenes, cycloalkenes, alkanes, cycloalkanes, aromatics, phenols, ethers, ketones, alcohols, N-containing species, and other species. The relative contents of alkenes and alkanes were dominant regardless of the variegation of heating rate, residence time and pyrolysis final temperature. Furthermore, the trend of each species under different influence factor conditions achieved different tunes rendered with equal skill.

AB Thermoelectric cooler has been widely used in the thermal management of various electronic devices. However, the application of micro-thermoelectric cooler to high power light-emitting diode still needs to be further explored at present. This paper aims to establish a model of high power light-emitting diode package integrated with micro-thermoelectric cooler and explore the performance of this system under various interfacial and size effects. An experiment is conducted to validate the model. Five types of the micro-thermoelectric coolers are designed and integrated to the light-emitting diode package to reduce the localized junction temperature of the light-emitting diode chip. The influence of interfacial effects, thermoelectric element size, and driving power of micro-thermoelectric cooler on the system-level thermal and optical performance is discussed. Results indicate that the micro-thermoelectric cooler with 6 x 6 thermoelectric elements shows the best cooling performance for the driving power of micro-thermoelectric cooler lower than 0.85 W. For thermoelectric cooler with 6 x 6 thermoelectric elements, a minimum chip junction of 95.9 degrees C, which is 12.3 degrees C lower than that of the light emitting diode without micro-thermoelectric cooler, can be achieved. This characteristic can increase the luminous efficacy and lifetime by 12.3% and 50%, respectively. It also found that the electrical boundary resistance plays a more dominant role, compared with the thermal boundary resistance. However, the thermal contact resistance exhibits greater adverse impact than the electrical contact resistance. In addition, a total performance improvement proportion of 25.5% can still be achieved, although the micro-thermoelectric cooler consumes power energy by 22.5% at the driving power of 0.87 W.

AB This work presents an efficient model to simulate the steady operation of biomass boilers and to analyze the thermal behavior of the system in different working scenarios. The model is based on the implementation of calculations on the thermal conversion of biomass in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) environment to solve the gas phase. The mass, energy and species balances and reactions that take place in the biomass packed bed are introduced in a porous region inside the computational domain of the boiler. The biomass thermal conversion is combined with other submodels, such as radiation transport, gas transport and chemical reactions, to solve the complex combustion phenomena with relatively little computational effort. The model is tested by comparing two different simulations with their respective experimental tests. Parameters relative to the boiler thermal performance and contaminant emissions are compared with reasonably good results. The potential of the model to analyze different operation conditions of a boiler is applied to the theoretical study of the effect of the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on the boiler performance and the gas contaminant emissions. For this study, several simulations of a boiler fed with pure oxygen are performed by changing the EGR fraction and the oxygen excess. The results of the study show that the EGR effect can increase the boiler thermal performance, especially for low oxygen excess values. This effect also reduces the NOx emissions for low oxygen excess values. EGR does not seem to have any significant effect on CO emissions.

AB The aim of the present work deals with the investigation of compression ignition characteristics for different concentrations of diethyl ether in diesel - Calophyllum Inophyllum Methyl Ester blends. Initially, various experiments were conducted for diesel, neat biodiesel, 50% blends of diesel and biodiesel at various engine loads with constant speed conditions. All the ternary blends were prepared by adding 5%,7.5%, 10% and 12.5% of diethyl ether with diesel-biodiesel blends. The addition of diethyl ether was limited by 12.5% by volume because the engine was not running at higher engine loads. The experimental study revealed that the brake thermal efficiency was reduced by 5.3% with increase in brake specific fuel consumption for 12.5% addition of diethyl ether in the blend when compared to diesel fuel. Further, the diesel engine operation with diesel-biodiesel-diethyl ether ternary blends has shown 84%, 4.6% and 57% reduction in unburned hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen emissions than that of diesel fuel at 100% engine load. The carbon dioxide emission formation was similar to diesel fuel at lower concentration of diethyl ether and 5.2% reduction was noted for higher fraction in the blend. Meanwhile, the smoke opacity has increased to 80.1% for 12.5% of diethyl ether addition in the blend. However, the combustion characteristics are slightly dropdown when the diesel engine was operated with all the ternary blends of diethyl ether.

AB The present study aims at assessing, from a theoretical point of view, the feasibility of on-board production and use of Oxy-Hydrogen (HHO) as fuel additive in internal combustion engines. From the available literature, many works deal with the experimental investigation of the benefits achieved with HHO use in both compression and spark ignition engines in terms of brake thermal efficiency improvement and emissions reduction. Nevertheless, a thorough demonstration of the feasibility of HHO on-board production and use has not been performed yet, also due to the unclear nature of the generated HHO mixture. To bridge this gap, a rigorous analysis of the energetic needs related to HHO production through electrolysis, with the internal combustion engine as unique power supply, is here described in details. An innovative assumption is proposed to achieve a generalized representation of HHO mixture and univocally determine the energetic requirements related to its production. A conventional layout is considered to define realistic restrictions for HHO use and fuel savings achievement. Several case studies, based on works available in the literature, are investigated to prove the validity of the proposed analysis and assess the feasibility of the technological approach.

AB Electromagnetic energy harvesters have been studied intensively in the past decade as non-stop power solutions for low-power wireless electronic devices. We here exploit a new way, i.e., forming an abrupt change of magnetic flux density, to improve harvester performance. A new transducer is proposed, which is primarily composed of a set of magnet array, a pair of springs and a coil array. Four cases are investigated: cubic magnets in Halbach and alternative configurations; triangle magnets in Halbach and alternative configurations. We examined the magnetic flux density distribution via the finite element method (FEM) and ensured the nonexistence of phase difference in two contiguous coils. We fabricated a prototype and conducted comprehensive tests, of frequency sweep with and without external resistances, of matching impedance and of obtaining maximum RMS power output. The FEM analysis indicates that the harvester in the cubic alternative case has the largest changing rate of the magnetic flux density (MFD) in terms of the magnitude and the distance range of the change. Experiments verify the FEM simulation and the prototype with the cubic alternative magnet array shows the highest voltage response of 20 V and a maximum RMS power output of 35.5 mW under a harmonic excitation of 9.8 m/s(2), which is much higher than those in the other cases. In term of the volume and mass power density, the alternative arrangement of cubic magnets displays the most desirable outputs at 0.4955 mW/cm(3) and 0.28 mW/g, respectively, which are three and two times as high as those of the second best case - the triangle Halbach case. This detailed study reveals the considerable benefits brought by the magnet arrays of alternating polarity and configuration, and paves a new way to improve the performance of electromagnetic energy harvesters.

AB While using microbial lipids as a biodiesel feedstock, effective extraction of lipids is essential. Also, the crude lipase produced from waste organics could be a potentially low-cost biocatalyst for the transesterification process. In this study ultrasound with the suitable solvent system was used for extracting the lipids from novel oleaginous yeast Naganishia liquefaciens NITTS2. Highest lipid recovery obtained was 99.3 +/- 0.1% at optimized biomass concentration (60 g/L), solvents ratio (1: 1, chloroform/methanol), ultrasound power density (0.6 W/mL), 30 degrees C and 30 min. This lipid was characterized by GC-MS. It was then converted into biodiesel with garbage lipase as a catalyst using RSM designed transesterification process, which yielded 97.13 +/- 1.05% at the optimum of 6.4 methanol/oil molar ratio, 20% enzyme concentration, 35 degrees C and 16 h. Thus, ultrasound aided extraction could be a promising method for lipid recovery from microbial biomass and the garbage lipase can be a sustainable, eco-friendly catalyst for commercial biodiesel production.

AB A new Energy Management Strategy to reduce the hydrogen consumption is proposed for Hybrid Power Systems based on Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell system used as backup source. The Energy Management Strategy uses a Load Following control loop of requested load demand on DC bus and an optimization control loop to improve the fuel economy based on the Global Extremum Seeking algorithm applied to the air flow rate. The performance of proposed strategy is compared to the one obtained with the Static Feed-Forward strategy considering three case studies for the optimization function used in different scenarios for power flow on DC bus (variable or constant load demand, without or with variable renewable energy power).

AB Catalyst deactivation by coking and sintering over Ni-based catalysts is still an open question for carbon dioxide reforming of methane (CDRM). Here, Ni/MoCeZr/MgAl2O4-MgO complex support catalysts were successfully synthesized by calcination of the Ce, Zr and Mo promoted NiMgAl-hydrotalcite-like precursors using a simple one-step co-precipitation method. Particular attention was paid to the anti-coking properties and catalytic behaviors of these complex support catalysts prepared at different calcination temperatures (700, 800 and 900 degrees C). Under harsh conditions (at 900 degrees C under GHSV of 60,000mL.h(-1).g(cat)(-1) and without using inert gases as diluents), the catalyst calcined at 800 degrees C yielded a high conversion of CH4 and CO2 above 95% and long-term stability for 658 h without any remarkable coke deposition (only 0.015 mg(c).h(-1).g(cat)(-1)), outperforming the catalysts obtained at other calcination temperatures. Coking analysis showed that all the catalysts generated negligible coke deposition, indicating that solving the coke deposition problem puzzled researchers for many years is possible. Further analysis revealed that the generation of small Ni nanoparticles (< 9 nm), strong basicity and intimated metal-support interactions coupled with the high reaction temperature might be the reasons for the stable coke-free process. This work may serve as an important reference for other kinds of catalysts suffering deactivation due to coking and/or sintering.

AB A thermoelectric generator used to recover energy from the exhaust gases of a heavy-duty freight vehicle is numerically simulated and optimized using two different algorithms: a gradient-based search method, and a global and local direct search method. The model uses a one-dimensional finite volume method to calculate the temperature and the convective heat transfer of the hot and cold fluids along the streamwise direction, as well as the pressure drop, and employs a thermal resistance network and a global energy balance to account for the heat transfer and the thermoelectric effect. Three different heat exchanger configurations are studied with plain, offset strip or triangular fins. The objective function is the net output power, and the geometrical dimensions of the heat exchanger and thermoelectric units are taken as design variables. The results show that the height of the fins, the spacing between them, the height and side length of the cross section of the thermoelectric units, and the distance between the legs are critical parameters in the optimization process. The thickness of the fins, wall ducts, electrical conductor and ceramic strips should be as small as possible, as well as the height of the cooling wall duct. The two optimization methods yield similar optimal solutions.

AB The synthesis of glycerol carbonate (GC) from glycerol and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) catalyzed by oil palm empty fruit bunch ash (EFBA) was developed in this work. The catalyst was calcined at a temperature range of 300-600 degrees C, and the effect of temperature was correlated with the catalyst structure-activity relationship, the total basicity, and basic strength. The catalyst characteristics were investigated by the N-2-adsorption-desorption, Fourier transform infrared, FTIR, X-ray diffraction, XRD, and Scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectroscopy, SEM/EDS. The results show that increasing calcination temperature propagates crystalline phase transition from KAlSiO4 to K2Mg(SiO4) by incorporating more K+ in the tetrahedral framework of SiO2 connected with Mg2+O4. Consequently, catalyst basic strength was enhanced and a significant amount of basic sites was generated with a corresponding increase in the GC yield. Also, the reaction temperature, initial DMC/glycerol molar ratio, catalyst dosage, and reaction time influence the yield of GC. Hence, 95.7% GC yield was achieved under 5 wt.% catalyst concentration, 90 degrees C, and initial DMC/glycerol molar ratio of 3:1 under 45 min reaction time. The catalyst sustained 85.2% GC yield after four times reuse, indicating relatively high stability without severe deactivation.

AB Fast urbanization process and promotion of life standard in China requires a great amount of energy input in building heating sector. North China now faces challenges of upgrading existing fossil fuel based high emission district heating systems into more environmental friendly heating systems. South China is discussing to choose proper building heating solutions for new and existing buildings which lack proper heating facilities. Renewable heating technologies such as ground source heat pump and air source heat pump are candidates to upgrade traditional heating solutions such as fossil fuel boilers and electric heaters. In order to find the most feasible building heating solution for different geolocations of China, this paper proposes a spatial data based techno-economic and environmental analysis methodology to fulfill such research gap. Case studies are carried out in two selected cities by using proposed methodology. Evaluation model shows that, heat pumps is quite competitive in south China compared with electric heaters, whereas in north China heat pumps have to reach several preconditions to be competitive with coal boiler district heating system under current techno-economic and environmental situations. In north China, a heat pump should reach a minimum seasonal coefficient of performance of 2.5-3.7 (for ground source heat pump) or 2.7-3.0 (for air source heat pump) to become CO2 and PM2.5 emission neutral as well as economically competitive compared with coal boiler district heating system. The advantage of proposed methodology is its simplicity in execution and could be repeated to other areas as the data required are available.

AB Home retrofitting provides a means to improve the basic energy and comfort characteristics of a building stock, which cannot be renewed because of prohibitive costs. We analyze how model predictive control (MPC) applied to indoor microclimate control can provide energy-efficient solutions to the problem of occupants' comfort in a variety of situations principally imposed by external weather and room occupancy. For this purpose we define an objective function for the energy consumption, and we consider two illustrative cases: one building designed and built in recent times with modern HVAC equipment, and one designed and built several decades ago with poor thermal characteristics and no dedicated ventilation system. Our model includes various physical effects such as air infiltration and indoor thermal "inertia mass" (inner walls, floor, ceiling, and furniture), and also accounts for the impact of human presence essentially as heat and CO2 sources. The influence on the numerical results of forecast horizons and of uncertainties due to inaccuracies in the weather and room occupancy forecasts, are analyzed. As we solve non-convex optimization problems using a linear and a nonlinear optimizer, full MPC performance is compared to both linearized MPC and a standard on/off controller. The main advantage of MPC is its ability to provide satisfactory solutions for microclimate control at the least possible energy cost for both modern and old buildings. As old buildings are usually not properly ventilated, we see in light of our simulation results, that a supply ventilation system installation provides a solution for significant air quality improvement.

AB In this research work, the performance of a concentrator photovoltaic Nanoparticle-phase change material (CPV-Nanoparticle-PCM) hybrid system is investigated at a solar concertation ratio (CR) of 20. The influence of different nanoparticles (Al2O3, CuO and SiO2) at loading ratios (1 wt% and 5 wt%) on the overall performance of a concentrator photovoltaic system is explored. A comprehensive two-dimensional hybrid model consisting of photovoltaic layers and a Nanoparticle-PCM heat sink is developed and numerically simulated. The predicted results are validated using the available experimental and numerical data. It is found that PCM's thermal conductivity has significantly increased with the addition of Al2O3, compared with CuO, SiO2 nanoparticle which enhances the process of heat transfer, melting rate, and accordingly reduces the solar cell temperature. Furthermore, using Nanoparticle-PCM attains a higher temperature uniformity and electrical efficiency of the CPV system. It is found that utilizing Al2O3-PCM at 5 wt% attains an electrical efficiency of 8% and temperature uniformity of 12 degrees C compared to pure PCM (0 wt%) where the electrical efficiency reaches 6.36 % and a temperature uniformity of 20 degrees C. This novel CPV-Nanoparticle-PCM system can be recommended for residential and industrial applications due to its ability to save energy and offer safe operating conditions.

AB Silicon thin films with sub-1 mu m thickness are of technological significance in many electronic and energy conversion devices. While a number of previous works have investigated the in-plane thermal conductivity of silicon films, less reported is their cross-plane thermal conductivity, particularly at sub-1 mu m thickness. Here, we report on the cross-plane thermal conductivity of sub-1 mu m, undoped, polycrystalline silicon films (75 and 246 nm) with columnar grain structure at room temperature. Using an optical pump-probe thermoreflectance metrology and a semi-classical phonon transport model, we find the cross-plane thermal conductivity to be 4.5 +/- 0.8 and 12.5 +/- 2.3 W m(-1) K-1 for the 75 and 246 nm films, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the cross-plane thermal conductivities we report here are the lowest ever reported for undoped polycrystalline silicon films with columnar grain structure, which can be ascribed to the impact of increased phonon scattering by a higher density of defects as compared to previous data. Given that a significant reduction in phonon thermal conductivity is required to enhance the thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency, our findings may be promising particularly for thermoelectric energy conversion applications.

AB An exergy cost assessment of integrated solar multi-generation schemes, which includes cogeneration, trigeneration, and polygeneration schemes, for the joint production of electricity, fresh water, cooling, and process heat, is carried out. This evaluation process allows finding out the key equipment to improve the design, detect potential energy savings, and establish the best configurations of these schemes, in terms of unit exergy cost, total exergy cost, and exergy efficiency. The methodology includes modelling and evaluating the performance of solar multi-generation schemes and stand-alone systems, by applying the symbolic exergoeconomic methodology. The solar multi-generation schemes consider a concentrated solar power as the prime mover, which is coupled to a multi-effect distillation, an absorption refrigeration, and a process heat plant. Twenty-one configurations were investigated, twenty of them regarding solar multi-generation plants: eight of cogeneration, eight of trigeneration, four polygeneration schemes, and the other one considering stand-alone systems. This study reveals that the recommended configurations for the solar multigeneration schemes are those in which the desalination plant replaces the condenser of the power cycle, and the refrigeration plant, as well as the process heat module are coupled to turbine extractions. Furthermore, the main components contributing to the cost formation of electricity are, in this order, solar collectors, evaporator, and reheater. In the case of by-products generated, the main components are dissipative systems, solar collectors, and productive subsystems (multi effect distillation, refrigeration, and process heat plants). In consequence, they constitute the key equipment that could be improved. Finally, solar multi-generation schemes are more cost effective than stand-alone systems. For instance, the best option within the polygeneration schemes analyzed allowed reducing the unit exergy cost about 6.8%, 59.2%, 45.6%, and 32.2% for electricity, water, cooling, and process heat respectively. Therefore, solar multi-generation schemes are identified as a promising alternative for zones with high irradiation conditions and scarcity of water, where the CSP technology can be the prime mover.

AB Solar power is considered among the leading renewable energy technologies. Abundant supply, flexibility of installation, and decreasing cost makes it an interesting renewable energy resource. However, there are challenges associated with the reliability of solar power due to its intermittent nature. This work demonstrates the synergies that exist in integrated hybrid systems, where a dispatchable fuel is used in conjunction with concentrated solar power. In this simulation-based study, a parabolic trough solar concentrator is used to collect solar energy. The heat collected from the solar field is used to generate steam in a Rankine cycle. The system also utilizes natural gas combustion in the steam generator to provide supplemental steam when the solar intensity is reduced due to cloud cover or at night. Natural gas is also used for superheating the steam, which allows the system to produce higher temperatures and achieve increased thermodynamic cycle efficiencies. This flexible design produces 100 MW at nominal conditions, while it is capable of producing a maximum of 140 MW when sufficient solar energy is available. The novel contributions of this work include a complete, systems-level, dynamic model of a hybrid solar plant. The model is complete with a control system that smoothly transitions the plant from pure natural gas mode at night to solar hybrid mode during the day. It evaluates innovative design features such as flexible fuel operation, steam superheating to boost efficiency, and preheating by solar or waste heat. Furthermore, this work demonstrates that by hybridizing a solar system with a dispatchable energy source, both the reliability and efficiency of the solar power production are increased. The annual solar-to-electric efficiency increases from 15.2% to 26.13% with hybridization, which indicates that utilization of the solar energy is effectively increased.

AB This study presents a novel maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm via dynamic leader based collective intelligence (DLCI) of PV systems affected by partial shading condition (PSC). Different from the conventional meta-heuristic algorithms, DLCI is consisted of multiple sub-optimizers, which can achieve a much wider exploration by fully collaborating the optimization ability of various searching mechanisms instead of a single searching mechanism. In order to achieve a deeper exploitation, the sub-optimizer with the current best solution is chosen as the dynamic leader for an efficient searching guidance to other sub-optimizers. Although the multiple sub-optimizers of DLCI will result in a higher computational complexity, it can offer an enhanced searching ability and a more stable convergence compared to that of conventional meta-heuristic algorithms. Since it does not reply on the system model, DLCI can be easily applied to other optimization tasks. Four case studies, including start-up test, step change in solar irradiation with constant temperature, gradual change in both solar irradiation and temperature, and daily field data of solar irradiation and temperature in Hong Kong, are undertaken. They attempt to evaluate the effectiveness and advantages of DLCI in comparison to that of conventional incremental conductance (INC) and eight typical meta-heuristic algorithms, e.g., genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), artificial bees colony (ABC), Cuckoo search algorithm (CSA), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), moth-flame optimization (MFO), whale optimization algorithm (WOA), and teaching learning-based optimization (TLBO), respectively. Lastly, a dSpace based hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test is carried out to validate the implementation feasibility of DLCI based MPPT technique. Both the case studies and HIL test demonstrate that the searching ability of DLCI can be significantly improved via an effective coordination between multiple sub-optimizers, which can make the PV system generate more energy (up to 36.64%) and smaller power fluctuation (up to 21.17%) than other methods with a single searching mechanism.

AB Chemical looping reforming (CLR) coupling with chemical looping hydrogen (CLH) was proposed to reform biomass based pyrolysis gas and achieve high purity H-2 by using Fe/Ni/Al oxygen carriers derived from layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors. The crystal form, morphology and reactivity of oxygen carriers were characterized by various analysis methods. The chemical looping reaction process was investigated in a fixed bed reactor. The experimental results exhibited that Fe0,99Ni0.6Al1.1O4 high dispersed oxygen carrier was synthesized. Moderate lattice oxygen releasing rate 0.00175 wt%/s and escape ratio 95.14% were achieved by the mixed oxygen carrier with Fe/Ni ratio of 3/1. Ni had positive effect on lattice oxygen escape ratio of oxygen carrier while Fe contributed to improve the instantaneous lattice oxygen releasing rate. Furthermore, the CH4/CO2 in biomass based pyrolysis gas was eliminated via CLR process based on the metal catalytic effect of oxygen carrier. The highest CH4 conversion 98.26% and CO2 conversion 71.92% were obtained in CLR process accompanying with the reduction of Fe0.99Ni0.6Al1.1O4 to Fe/Ni alloy. Additionally, H-2 with 96.56% purity was achieved in CLH process with the conversion of Fe/Ni alloy to Fe3O4. The H-2 instantaneous generation rate increased sharply to the maximum value 34.70 ml/min and then declined gradually. Ni0.6Fe2.4Al1.1O4 new high dispersed compound was generated in the regeneration stage with similar structure to fresh sample and more active Fe species content. Though the particle size of oxygen carrier tended to decline after whole reaction process, the porous structure was still reserved.

AB This paper presents experimental investigation for the effects of a phase change material (PCM) and a nano/ phase change material (nano-PCM) on the thermal performance of an electronic chipset. A thermal storage system using Paraffin wax as a PCM is integrated with a heat sink. Additionally, the PCM is modified as nano-PCM by mixing it with multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The effects of various quantities of the PCM, concentrations of the MWCNTs in the PCM, and different power levels on three different modules of heat sinks (without PCM, filled with PCM, and filled with nano-PCM) are studied in passive and active operating modes. Experiments are also performed when the heat flux is applied intermittently, which commonly encountered in the thermal management of portable electronic devices. The phase front propagation is captured and analyzed by an image processing technique. It is found that the PCM can significantly increase the usage time of the system and the nano-PCM as compared to the PCM can extend this time under passive cooling condition. Under active cooling condition, the usage of PCM and nano-PCM may increase the steady-state temperature; however, it reduces the operating temperature of the chipset at the beginning period of the operating time. The nano-PCM module can enhance thermal management of the system by reducing the cooling time up to 6% as compared to the PCM. Under intermittent heating, using more on-and-off cycles lead to decreasing the chipset peak temperature. Using PCM and nano-PCM increases the operating time and reduces the peak temperature of the chipset under intermittent use.

AB Waste heat recovery is significant to improve energy utilization. Expander is one of the most important components in waste heat recovery. Tesla turbine offers an attractive option for the expander if an efficient design can be well achieved. Faced the theoretical and computational challenges associated with the feasibility of Tesla turbine in a small-scale waste heat recovery system, this paper formulates a systematic design methodology to seek optimal parameters and geometric model of the Tesla turbine which is applied to a coolant waste heat recovery system of an automobile engine. To achieve this goal, a detailed investigation into the performance of Tesla turbine, which incorporates experimental and computational fluid dynamics analysis manifests that Tesla turbine achieves higher performance at lower rotation-speed. Performance analysis on the waste heat recovery system under various operating conditions is conducted based on a comprehensive thermodynamic model. Results show that the total power and overall thermal efficiency of the waste heat recovery system are clearly increased over a low rotation-speed range, furtherly, which can be improved by selecting appropriate viscosity of the working fluid and number of nozzles. It is desirable and significative to effectively improve power output and thermal efficiency for an automobile engine at a lower expense of volume and cost.

AB This paper presents the differences in thermodynamic properties of refrigerants in different spatial conformation, showing the superiority of molecular simulation in predicting thermodynamic properties of fluids. And molecular simulation was modified to improve prediction accuracy of thermodynamic properties of fluids at high temperature and pressure. Meanwhile, a new high temperature heat pump refrigerant mixture named NBY-1 was proposed, and its thermodynamic properties were estimated with the modified molecular simulation. Then the experiment investigation was carried out and showed the good cycle performance of NBY-1 as the refrigerant. The experimental results indicated that high temperature heat pump using NBY-1 could supply high temperature water of 130 degrees C with the highest coefficient of performance of 2.74 and the condensing pressure of 2.55 MPa, when the temperature lift was 50 degrees C. Moreover, the experiment also demonstrated the high accuracy with molecular simulation in predicting thermodynamic properties of NBY-1 in the two phase region, and the average relative deviation of condensing pressure between predicted results and experimental results was 2.59% with the highest value of 3.89%.

AB In this experimental work, the energetic and exergetic performance enhancement of solar distillation system (solar still incorporated with PCM storage unit) is performed by using two techniques. First, pin fins heat sink (PF) is embedded inside the PCM to act as a thermal conductivity enhancer. Second, black steel mesh fibers (SWF) are employed in the solar still basin with PCM. In this regard, four cases of the solar stills are studied and compared conventional still: conventional solar still (without PCM), still with PCM (With PCM), still with PCM and pin fins heat sink embedded in the PCM (With PCM-PF) and still with PCM and SWF in the basin (With PCM-SWF). The energetic and exergetic performance of the four cases is evaluated and compared under the meteorological conditions of New Borg El-Arab City, Egypt. The results show that the total daily cumulative yield of distilled water of still with PCM, still with PCM-PF, and still with PCM-SWF are greater than of conventional still by 9.5%, 16.8%, and 13%, respectively. Additionally, the inclusion of the fins heat sink in the PCM increases the average daily energy and exergy efficiencies by 17.9, and 13.2%, respectively compared to conventional one. Likewise, the energy and exergy efficiencies of still with PCM-PF are higher than those of solar still with PCM by 7.7 and, 6.8%, respectively. Furthermore, placing SWF in the basin of still with PCM significantly enhances the daytime energy and exergy efficiencies with a considerable reduction of these values in the nighttime. The total daily evaporative exergy for still with PCM-SWF is greater than those of conventional still, still with PCM, and still with PCM-PF by 13, 8, and 2%, respectively. Also, still with PCM, still with PCM-PF, and still with PCM-SWF exhibit an increment of the daily exergy efficiency 5.9, 13.2, and 17.3%, respectively compared to still without PCM. Still with PCM-PF achieved the highest accumulated daily water productivity and energy efficiency but still with PCM-SWF attained the highest daily exergy efficiency with nearly no additional cost.

AB Solar Photovoltaic systems (SPVSs) are becoming one of the most popular renewable energy technology for generating significant share of electric power. With the consistent growth of SPVSs applications, the challenge of parameters estimation of photovoltaic cells has drawn the attention of researchers and industrialists and gained immense momentum for SPVSs modeling. This paper proposes an efficient approach based on Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) for extracting the parameters of the electrical equivalent circuit of PV cell based double-diode model. The experimental and comparative results demonstrate that SSA is highly competitive with the results of two algorithms that have never been used before for the PV cell parameter extraction namely Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) and Virus Colony Search Algorithm (VCS). SSA is also significantly better than three well established parameter extraction algorithms namely Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). Several evaluation criteria including Mean Square Error (MSE), Absolute Error (AE) and statistical criterion show that the SSA algorithm provides the highest value of accuracy and has merits in designing SPVSs.

AB This study proposed a novel configuration of solar concentrating receivers that utilize Nano-fluids for spectral splitting and coupled with Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) for heat recovery. 1-D modelling of a conventional Parabolic Trough Collector was performed for validation and results were in the range of +/- 5% of experimental data. Model was further advanced for 1-D thermal modelling of Concentrating Photovoltaic Thermal (CPV/T) and Nano-fluid Filter based CPV/T (NFCPV/T) Collectors that were coupled with ORC. Highly efficient triple junction InGaP/InGaAs/Ge was selected as PV cells for concentrating solar system while R1233zd was chosen as working fluid for ORC. Optical modelling of water/Ag solution as Nano-fluid was integrated with overall system and performance results of CPV/T and NFCPV/T combined with ORC were compared. Comparative study of electrical (eta(electrical)), thermal (eta(thermal)) and overall (eta(overall)) efficiencies demonstrated that NFCPV/T outperformed CPV/T especially at concentration ratios greater than 7 with values of 1.8%, 3.3% and 5.1% respectively. Parametric study of input variables were conducted to identify those inputs that have most considerable influence on key outputs. DIRECT optimization of system performance (eta(system)) demonstrated that NFCPV/T coupled with ORC has markedly higher eta(system) of about 2.71% compared to CPV/T. These results highlight effectiveness of proposed NFCPV/T configuration.

AB Recently, studies have been evaluating the thermodynamic performance of new configurations of integrated waste-to-energy/gas turbine cycles, but a question still remains: "Instead of building new natural gas power plants or installing conventional waste-to-energy facilities, should one be investing in flexible efficient hybrid plants?" This article aims at presenting a novel comprehensive approach to help answering this question. The strategy intends to demonstrate how to integrate four known key procedures (energy, exergy, economic and environmental analysis) in an original manner in order to evaluate the feasibility of such systems. The technique consists of a conventional Energy-Exergy analysis followed by a new Environmental-Economic approach. The novelties are in the economic and environmental parts, namely: (i) the use of multiple cost equations for estimating the plant's initial investment range and (ii) the indirect estimate of the pollution abatement system cost through an energy-ecological efficiency indicator. A case study configuration (similar to the existing plant of Bilbao) is used as exercise to demonstrate the method and its comparability potential, as well as to allow discussion using tangible results. The case-studied plant has a power output capacity of 107 MWe, thermal efficiency of 36%, ecological efficiency of 89%, thermal waste input capacity of 155 MWt and levelized cost of electricity production of US$ 64-89 per MWh. It is compared to several existing single-fueled waste-to-energy facilities and other energy sources, including renewable and non-renewable. As unique findings of this research, it is shown that the proposed economic method allows to predict costs quite accurately and that the specific investment costs of such technology are very attractive compared to existing single-fueled waste-to-energy facilities in Europe and other electricity sources in the Brazilian context. The proposed method proved to be a comprehensive procedure to analytically evaluate the feasibility of hybrid waste-to-energy power plants, which present good potential in the Energy conversion field.

AB Among internet and smart device applications, Twitter has become a leading social media platform, disseminating online events occurring in the world on a real-time basis. Many studies have been conducted to identify valuable information on Twitter. Recently, Frequent Pattern Mining has been applied for topic detection on Twitter. In Frequent Pattern Mining, a topic is considered to be a group of words that appear simultaneously, however, the method only considers the frequency of words, and their utility for topic detection is not considered in the process of pattern generation. In this paper, we propose a method to detect emerging topics on Twitter based on High Utility Pattern Mining (HUPM), which takes frequency and utility into account at the same time. For a chunk of tweets by time-based windowing on the Twitter stream, we define the utility of words based on the growth rate in frequency and find groups of words with high frequency and high utility by HUPM. For post-processing to extract actual topic patterns from candidate topic patterns generated by HUPM, an efficient data structure called Topic-tree (TP-Tree) is also proposed. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method, which showed superior performance and shorter running time than other tested topic detection methods. In particular, the proposed method showed a 5% higher topic recall than the other compared methods for the three datasets used. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We have developed, in collaboration with medical and computer experts, the ontology-based Medical Report Mapping Process to support the transformation of unstructured reports into a structured representation. Nevertheless, the techniques employed in this two-phase process must be performed individually and manually by computer instructions, which hinder their use by users not familiar with such language. Thereby, this work proposes a tool to automate and optimize this process by integrating its techniques in a computational system, which was built using a software engineering prototyping approach. This system was experimentally evaluated by applying it to a set of 100 textual reports. The first phase decreased the total number of phrases (853) and words (2520) by 82.25% (48) and 92.70% (184), respectively. In the second phase, 100% of the relevant pieces of information (previously established) present in the reports were transcribed. Also, the second phase was applied, using the same configuration as the first study, in another set with 250 textual reports, resulting in a mapping rate of 99.74%. The unprocessed and unmapped words, regarding both experimental evaluations, were recorded for later inclusion into the ontology. By using this system, efficient and scalable investigations can be performed from medical reports, contributing to generate new knowledge. Also, the system facilitates the definition of these structures due to the feasibility to analyze different sentences in unique phrase sets. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Neighborhood construction models are important in finding connection among the data points, which helps demonstrate interrelations among the information. Hence, employing a new approach to find neighborhood among the data points is a challenging issue. The methods, suggested so far, are not useful for simultaneous analysis of distances and precise examination of the geometric position of the data as well as their geometric relationships. Moreover, most of the suggested algorithms depend on regulating parameters including number of neighborhoods and limitations in fixed regions. The purpose of the proposed algorithm is to detect and offer an applied geometric pattern among the data through data mining. Precise geometric patterns are examined according to the relationships among the data in neighborhood space. These patterns can reveal the behavioural discipline and similarity across the data. It is assumed that there is no prior information about the data sets at hand. The aim of the present research study is to locate the precise neighborhood using Apollonius circle, which can help us identify the neighborhood state of data points. High efficiency of Apollonius structure in assessing local similarities among the observations has opened a new field of the science of geometry in data mining. In order to assess the proposed algorithm, its precision is compared with the state-of-the-art and well-known (k-Nearest Neighbor and epsilon-neighborhood) algorithms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The presence of missing values in real-world data is not only a prevalent problem but also an inevitable one. Therefore, missing values should be handled carefully before the mining or learning process. This paper proposes a novel technique to impute missing data. It employs a new version of Fuzzy c-Means clustering algorithm which benefits from advantages of Grey Relational Grade over Minkowski-like similarity measures. To impute a missing value more accurately, it also performs a local mutual information based feature selection in each cluster to select only highly relevant features. Briefly, missing values are imputed in the following steps. First, the algorithm finds the importance of each missing attribute. Next, input instances are separated into several fuzzy clusters. Then, the algorithm selects clusters which satisfy a minimum condition. After that, it chooses highly dependent features of instances within each cluster using a mutual information based feature selection approach. When the features are selected, regression models will be applied to the selected features of the selected clusters to provide estimations for a missing value. Finally, the missing value is imputed through a weighted average of estimated values obtained from the previous step.
   Three well-known evaluation criteria and the accuracy of classification task are used to assess the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results for seven UCI data sets with different missing ratios and strategies indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms five other imputation methods in general.

AB This paper presents a hybrid approach for path planning of multiple mobile robots in continuous environments. For this purpose, first, an innovative Artificial Potential Field (APF) algorithm is presented to find all feasible paths between the start and destination locations in a discrete gridded environment. Next, an enhanced Genetic Algorithm (EGA) is developed to improve the initial paths in continuous space and find the optimal path between start and destination locations. The proposed APF works based on a time-efficient deterministic scheme to find a set of feasible initial paths and is guaranteed to find a feasible path if one exists. The EGA utilizes five customized crossover and mutation operators to improve the initial paths. In this paper, path length, smoothness, and safety are combined to form a multi-objective path planning problem. In addition, the proposed method is extended to deal with multiple mobile robot path planning problem. For this purpose, a new term is added to the objective function which measures the distance between robots and a collision removal operator is added to the EGA to remove possible collision between paths. To assess the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, 12 planar environments with different sizes and complexities were examined. Evaluations showed that the control parameters of the proposed algorithm do not affect the performance of the EGA considerably. Moreover, a comparative study has been made between the proposed algorithm, A*, PRM, B-RRT and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The comparative study showed that the proposed algorithm outperforms PSO as well as well-recognized deterministic (At) and probabilistic-(PRM and B-RRT) path planning algorithms in terms of path length; run time, and success rate. Finally, simulations proved the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for a four-robot path planning problem. In this case, not only the proposed algorithm determined collision free paths, but also it found near optimal solution for all robots. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The many vehicle crashes that are caused by driver sleepiness each year advocates the development of automated driver sleepiness detection (ADSD) systems. This study proposes an automatic sleepiness classification scheme designed using data from 30 drivers who repeatedly drove in a high-fidelity driving simulator, both in alert and in sleep deprived conditions. Driver sleepiness classification was performed using four separate classifiers: k-nearest neighbours, support vector machines, case-based reasoning, and random forest, where physiological signals and contextual information were used as sleepiness indicators. The subjective Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS) was used as target value. An extensive evaluation on multiclass and binary classifications was carried out using 10-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out validation. With 10-fold cross-validation, the support vector machine showed better performance than the other classifiers (79% accuracy for multiclass and 93% accuracy for binary classification). The effect of individual differences was also investigated, showing a 10% increase in accuracy when data from the individual being evaluated was included in the training dataset. Overall, the support vector machine was found to be the most stable classifier. The effect of adding contextual information to the physiological features improved the classification accuracy by 4% in multiclass classification and by and 5% in binary classification.

AB Stock market forecasting is a vital component of financial systems. However, the stock prices are highly noisy and non-stationary due to the fact that stock markets are affected by a variety of factors. Predicting stock market trend is usually subject to big challenges. The goal of this paper is to introduce a new hybrid, end-to-end approach containing two stages, the Empirical Mode Decomposition and Factorization Machine based Neural Network (EMD2FNN), to predict the stock market trend. To illustrate the method, we apply EMD2FNN to predict the daily closing prices from the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite (SSEC) index, the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) index and the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index (S&P 500), which respectively exhibit oscillatory, upward and downward patterns. The results are compared with predictions obtained by other methods, including the neural network (NN) model, the factorization machine based neural network (FNN) model, the empirical mode decomposition based neural network (EMD2NN) model and the wavelet de-noising-based back propagation (WDBP) neural network model. Under the same conditions, the experiments indicate that the proposed methods perform better than the other ones according to the metrics of Mean Absolute Error MAPE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Furthermore, we compute the profitability with a simple long-short trading strategy to examine the trading performance of our models in the metrics of Average Annual Return (AAR), Maximum Drawdown (MD), Sharpe Ratio (SR) and AAR/MD. The performances in two different scenarios, when taking or not taking the transaction cost into consideration, are found economically significant. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aims at analyzing the performance results of the European policies in energy investment within an integrated multidimensional quality measurement approach. For this purpose, the quality function deployment is adopted to the multidimensional performance measurement based on the balanced scorecard method. The dimensions and criteria of customer and technical requirements, process design, and performance measurement are defined to measure each process of QFD (Quality Function Deployment) for the energy investment policies with the supported literature. Within this context, the customer and technical requirements for energy investment policies are evaluated by considering the fuzzy decision matrix in the first process of the QFD and then, the technical requirements are used to rank the new service/product process of the energy investments in the second process of QFD. The balanced scorecard perspectives and the key factors are defined to rank the European energy investment policies respectively. Accordingly, the possible priorities of the European energy investment policies are discussed to conduct the most remarkable and efficient energy operations and the relevant results to contribute the improvement of energy sector are highlighted.

AB A social network as an essential communication platform facilitates the interactions of online users. Based on the interactions, users can influence or be affected by the opinions of others. The users being able to influence and shape the opinions of others are considered as opinion leaders. The problem of identifying opinion leaders is an important task due to its wide applications in reality, including product adoption for marketing and societal analytics. The problem has been attracting proliferating studies over the recent years. To overview and provide insights of the methodologies and enlighten the future study, we review the well-known techniques for opinion leader detection problems. These techniques are classified into descriptive approaches, statistical and stochastic methods, diffusion process based approaches, topological based methods, data mining and learning methods, and approaches based on hybrid content mining. The advantages and drawbacks of each method are systematically analyzed and compared, to provide deep understanding into the existing research challenges and the direction of future trends. The findings of this review would be useful for those researchers are interested in identifying opinion leaders and influencers in social networks and related fields.

AB Facility location represents an important supply chain problem aiming at minimizing facility establishment and transportation cost to meet customer demands. Many facility location problem (FLP) instances can be modelled as p-median problems (PMP) and uncapacitated facility location (UFL) problems. While, most solution approaches assume totally reliable deployed facilities, facilities often experience disruptions and their failure often leads to a notably higher cost. Therefore, determination of facility locations and fortification of a subset of them within a limited budget are crucial to supply chain organizations to provide cost effective services in presence of probable disruptions. We propose an evolutionary learning technique to near-optimally solve two research problems: Reliable p-Median Problem and Reliable Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem considering heterogeneous facility failure probabilities, one layer of backup and limited facility fortification budget. The technique is illustrated using a case study and its performance is evaluated via benchmark results. We also provide an analysis on the effects on facility location by prioritizing customer demands and adopting geographic distance calculation. The approach allows fast generation of cost-effective and complete solution using reasonable computing power. Moreover, the underlying technique is customizable offering a trade-off between solution quality and computation time. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB I investigate whether an expert system can be used for profitable long-term asset management. The trading strategy of the expert system needs to be based on market predictions. To this end, I generate binary predictions of the market returns by using statistical and machine-learning algorithms. The methods used include logistic regressions, regularized logistic regressions and similarity-based classification. I test the methods in a contemporary data set involving data from eleven developed markets. Both statistical and economic significance of the results are considered. As an ensemble, the results seem to indicate that there is some degree of mild predictability in the stock markets. Some of the results obtained are highly significant in the economic sense, featuring annualized excess returns of 3.1% (France), 2.9% (Netherlands) and 0.8% (United States). However, statistically significant results are seldom found. Consequently, the results do not completely invalidate the efficient-market hypothesis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As a non-invasive and remote sensor, a Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) has found a broad spectrum of applications. It is a remote, non-line-of-sight sensor to detect threats more reliably and provide increased security protection, which is of utmost importance to military and law enforcement applications. However, the use of the LDV in situation surveillance, especially in vehicle classification, lacks systematic investigations as to its phenomenological and statistical properties. In this work, we aim to identify vehicles by their engine types within a very short period of time to yield a practical expert and intelligent system to classify vehicle engines remotely using laser sensors. Based on our preliminary success on the use of tone-pitch indexes (TPI) over these data, a new normalized tone-pitch indexing (nTPI) scheme is developed to capture engine periodic vibrations by various engine types with vibration data over a much shorter period (from 1.25 to 0.2 s), which makes it possible to monitor slowly moving vehicles around 15 miles per hour. We also exploit the learning power of neural computing, including artificial neural network (ANN), Deep Belief nets (DBN), Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). To apply a CNN, a two-dimensional array is formulated by stacking nTPI data in an overlapping manner, which is termed as 2DonTPI. The classification results using the proposed nTPI and 2DonTPI over a standard LDV dataset are promising: with encoding duration significantly smaller than that required by the original WI, consistently high performance is attained for all four neural computing methods. The new vibration data representation combined with neural computing approaches gives rise to a powerful expert and intelligent-system-for vehicle engine-classificationi-which-can find a great array of applications for civil, law enforcement, and military agencies for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance purposes that are of crucial importance to national and international security.

AB Communication through e-mails remains to be highly formalized, conventional and indispensable method for the exchange of information over the Internet. An ever-increasing ratio and adversary nature of spam e-mails have posed a great many challenges such as uneven class distribution, unequal error cost, frequent change of content and personalized context-sensitive discrimination. In this research, we propose a novel and distinctive approach to develop an incremental personalized e-mail spam filter. The proposed work is described using three significant contributions. First, we applied a novel term frequency difference and category ratio based feature selection function TFDCR to select the most discriminating features irrespective of the number of samples in each class. Second, an incremental learning model is used which enables the classifier to update the discriminant function dynamically. Third, a heuristic function called selectionRankWeight is introduced to upgrade the existing feature set that determines new features carrying strong discriminating ability from an incoming set of e-mails. Three public e-mail datasets possessing different characteristics are used to evaluate the filter performance. Experiments are conducted to compare the feature selection efficiency of TFDCR and to observe the filter performance under both the batch and the incremental learning mode. The results demonstrate the superiority of TFDCR as the most effective feature selection function. The incremental learning model incorporating dynamic feature update function overcomes the problem of drifting concepts. The proposed filter validates its efficiency and feasibility by substantially improving the classification accuracy and reducing the false positive error of misclassifying legitimate e-mail as spam.

AB A phishing attack is one of the most significant problems faced by online users because of its enormous effect on the online activities performed. In recent years, phishing attacks continue to escalate in frequency, severity and impact. Several solutions, using various methodologies, have been proposed in the literature to counter the web-phishing threats. Notwithstanding, the existing technology cannot detect the new phishing attacks accurately due to the insufficient integration of features of the text, image and frame in the evaluation process. The use of related features of images, frames and text of legitimate and non-legitimate websites and associated artificial intelligence algorithms to develop an integrated method to address these together. This paper presents an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) based robust scheme using the integrated features of the text, images and frames for web-phishing detection and protection. The proposed solution achieves 98.3% accuracies. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that considers the best-integrated text, image and frame feature based solution for phishing detection scheme. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Clustering is a major approach in data mining and machine learning and has been successful in many real-world applications. Density peaks clustering (DPC) is a recently published method that uses an intuitive to cluster data objects efficiently and effectively. However, DPC and most of its improvements suffer from some shortcomings to be addressed. For instance, this method only considers the global structure of data which leading to missing many clusters. The cut-off distance affects the local density values and is calculated in different ways depending on the size of the datasets, which can influence the quality of clustering. Then, the original label assignment can cause a "chain reaction", whereby if a wrong label is assigned to a data point, and then there may be many more wrong labels subsequently assigned to the other points. In this paper, a density peaks clustering method called DPC-DLP is proposed. The proposed method employs the idea of k-nearest neighbors to compute the global cut-off parameter and the local density of each point. Moreover, the proposed method uses a graph-based label propagation to assign labels to remaining points and form final clusters. The proposed label propagation can effectively assign true labels to those of data instances which located in border and overlapped regions. The proposed method can be applied to some applications. To make the method practical for image clustering, the local structure is used to achieve low-dimensional space. In addition, proposed method considers label space correlation, to be effective in the gene expression problems. Several experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that in most cases, the proposed method outperformed some state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved

AB Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) has drawn a lot of attention as its outstanding performance. However, same with certain typical swarm optimization algorithm, BBO severely suffers from premature convergence problem and the rotational variance of migration operator. In this paper, a two-stage differential biogeography-based optimization (TDBBO) is proposed to address the premature convergence problem and alleviate the rotational variance. In the migration operator, the emigration model is selected according to the two-stage mechanism. The constant emigration model is employed to maintain the diversity of population in the early evolutionary process. The sinusoidal emigration model is selected to accelerate the convergence speed in the late evolutionary process. Meanwhile, the BBO/current-to-select/1, which is a rotationally invariant arithmetic crossover operator, is designed to alleviate the rotational variance. The standard mutation operator is replaced by the Gaussian mutation operator to jump out the local optimum effectively. The greedy selection strategy is introduced to accelerate the convergence speed after the migration and the mutation operators. Besides, the convergence performance of TDBBO is analyzed with the Markov model. Compared with the standard BBO and other outstanding BBO variants on CEC 2017 benchmarks, the TDBBO is superior to the state-of-art BBO variants in terms of solution quality, convergence speed and stability. The TDBBO lays a solid foundation for solving optimization problems of expert and intelligent systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we will propose a novel approach based on graph analysis which will use community structure detection algorithm to detect topics in the keywords graph of micro-blogging data. Furthermore, considering the specificity of the Sina microblogging, we propose novel keywords filtering model and graph generation algorithm to meet the dual requirements of topic detection and community detection. We validate our approach on a big natural disaster dataset from Sina micro-blog, in which about 10(3) micro-blogging posts with about 10(4) distinct feature tags. The experimental results definitely revealed the relationship between the keywords and the natural disaster topics. Our methodology is a scalable method which can adapt to the changes in the amount of data. Especially, we can get abundant information about natural disasters in the topic detection and help the government guide the rescue of disasters. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB K-nearest neighbor (KNN) rule is a well-known non-parametric classifier that is widely used in pattern recognition. However, the sensitivity of the neighborhood size k always seriously degrades the KNN-based classification performance, especially in the case of the small sample size with the existing outliers. To overcome this issue, in this article we propose a generalized mean distance-based k-nearest neighbor classifier (GMDKNN) by introducing multi-generalized mean distances and the nested generalized mean distance that are based on the characteristic of the generalized mean. In the proposed method, multi-local mean vectors of the given query sample in each class are calculated by adopting its class-specific k nearest neighbors. Using the achieved k local mean vectors per class, the corresponding k generalized mean distances are calculated and then used to design the categorical nested generalized mean distance. In the classification phase, the categorical nested generalized mean distance is used as the classification decision rule and the query sample is classified into the class with the minimum nested generalized mean distance among all the classes. Extensive experiments on the UCI and KEEL data sets, synthetic data sets, the KEEL noise data sets and the UCR time series data sets are conducted by comparing the proposed method to the state-of-art KNN-based methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GMDKNN performs better and has the less sensitiveness to k. Thus, our proposed GMDKNN with the robust and effective classification performanrP could-be a promising method for-pattern-recognition-in some expert and intelligence systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper introduces a new method for calculating distances between matrix sequences of different length. Matrix sequences are often used in spatiotemporal analysis, a field of research combining topological frameworks and temporal reasoning. The Qualitative Trajectory Calculus, a spatiotemporal calculus using matrix sequences, is used as an example in this paper. Since current approaches for comparing sequences are not suitable to calculate distances between matrix sequences of different length, a new method is proposed. The method is based on sequence alignment and uses the Levenshtein distance metric as starting point. The method is presented in general at first, followed by an application to QTC-matrix sequences and a three cushion billiards movement pattern detection example. Possible applications in expert and intelligent systems are discussed, such as human-robot interaction with multiple robots, and automated traffic analysis of (autonomous) vehicle interactions. The proposed method, however, can be applied in a broad range of domains, whenever distances need to be calculated between matrix sequences of different length. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Collaborative filtering is an emerging recommender system technique that aims guiding users based on other customers preferences with behavioral similarities. Such correspondences are located based on preference history of users. A relatively new extension of traditional collaborative filtering schemes takes into account not only how much a user likes an item, but also why she likes the item by collecting multi-criteria preferences focusing on distinctive features of the items. These multi-criteria collaborative filtering systems have the potential to improve recommender system accuracy since they reveal multiple views of users on products. However, due to providing more insightful recommendations, such systems might be subjected to malicious attacks more substantially than the traditional ones. Attackers attempt to insert fake profiles to bias outputs of these systems in favor of a particular product or disrepute the system itself. Since outputs of expert systems directly dependent on input signals; interventions to the inputs coherently cause failures on productions of such systems. In this study, we examine shilling attack strategies against multi-criteria preference collections, how to extend well-known attack scenarios against these systems, and propose an alternative attacking scheme. We analyze the robustness of baseline multi-criteria recommendation algorithms regarding various similarity aggregation procedures against proposed attacking schemes by the extensive experimental investigation. Empirical results on real-world data demonstrate that these systems are highly vulnerable to manipulations and proper attack detection practices are needed to ensure recommendation quality. According to our findings, manipulative attempts at such expert systems mislead decision making process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a new metaheuristic approach for the two-stage capacitated facility location problem (TSCFLP), which the objective is to minimize the operation costs of the underlying two-stage transportation system, satisfying demand and capacity constraints. In this problem, a single product must be transported from a set of plants to meet customers demands passing out by intermediate depots. Since this problem is known to be NP-hard, approximated methods become an efficient alternative to solve real industry problems. As far as we know, the TSCFLP is being solved in most cases by hybrid approaches supported by an exact method, and sometimes a commercial solver is used for this purpose. Bearing this in mind, a BRKGA metaheuristic and a new local search for TSCFLP are proposed. It is the first time that BRKGA had been applied to this problem and the computational results show the competitiveness of the approach developed in terms of quality of the solutions and required computational time when compared with those obtained by state-of-the-art heuristics. The approach proposed can be easily coupled in intelligent systems to help organizations enhance competitiveness by optimally placing facilities in order to minimize operational costs.

AB Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the best performing and most widely used approaches for recommender systems. Although significant progress has been made in this area, current CF methods still suffer from cold-start and sparsity problems. A primary issue is that the fraction of users willing to rate items tends to be very small in most practical applications, which causes the number of users and/or items with few or no interactions in recommendation databases to be large. As a direct consequence of ratings sparsity, recommender algorithms may provide poor recommendations (reducing accuracy) or decline recommendations (reducing coverage). This paper proposes an ensemble scheme based on a co-training approach, named ECoRec, that drives two or more recommenders to agree with each others' predictions to generate their own. The experiments on eight real-life public databases show that better accuracy can be obtained when recommender algorithms are simultaneously trained from multiple views and combined into an ensemble to make predictions.

AB Goal: To develop a robust and real-time approach for automatic detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) in long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings using deep learning (DL). Method: An end-to-end model combining the Convolutional- and Recurrent-Neural Networks (CNN and RNN) was proposed to extract high level features from segments of RR intervals (RRIs) in order to classify them as AF or normal sinus rhythm (NSR). Results: The model was trained and validated on three different databases including a total of 89 subjects. It achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 98.98% and 96.95%, respectively, validated through a 5-fold cross-validation. Additionally, the proposed model was found to be computationally efficient and it was capable of analyzing 24 h of ECG recordings in less than one second. The proposed algorithm was also tested on the unseen datasets to examine its robustness in detecting AF for new recordings which resulted in 98.96% and 86.04% for specificity and sensitivity, respectively. Conclusion: Compared to the state-of-the-art models evaluated on standard benchmark ECG datasets, the proposed model produced better performance in detecting AF. Additionally, since the model learns features directly from the data, it avoids the need for clever/cumbersome feature engineering. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: This paper proposes a multi attribute decision support model in a supply chain in order to solve complex decision problems. The paper provides a platform to ease decision process through the integration of quality function deployment (QFD) and grey relational analysis (GRA) in demonstrating main supply chain drivers under fuzzy environment.
   Methodology: The proposed method is important because of several points: First of all, in a supply chain system, evaluation factors are not really independent and must be addressed in relation to the external factors such as customer requirements. Hence, we have applied QFD tool. Second, due to the constant uncertainty in the supply chain environment, fuzziness among the factors has to be considered. So, an interval valued fuzzy model was implemented. Third, to examine the proposed decision system in reality, it was applied in Risk and Uncertain Conditions for Agriculture Production Systems (RUC-APS) project.
   Contribution: An integrated version of QFD and GRA is presented. It is assumed that QFD can act to measure optimal solutions based on the distance to ideal solutions. In an interval-valued fuzzy environment the enormous volume of computation by Euclidean distance doesn't allow decision makers to obtain the results easily. This drawback is addressed using gray relational analysis. The gray relational coefficient is integrated to the fuzzy QFD to measure the distance of potential solutions from ideal solutions. This integration facilitates decision making process in further problems once big data are available
   Results: To obtain the importance degrees of logistic indicators in the supply chain, expert team considered the environmental, social & cultural, and economic factors as external dimension of the QFD. The other dimension of QFD includes supply chain drivers such as quality, environmental management system, supply chain flexibility, corporate social responsibility, transportation service condition, and financial stability. The decision model is solved and the ranking of indicators is achieved. A sensitivity analysis helps to test and check the performance of the decision model. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ultrasound imaging is most popular technique used for breast cancer screening. Lesion segmentation is challenging step in characterization of breast ultrasound (US) based Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems due to presence of speckle noise, shadowing effect etc. The aim of this study is to develop an automatic lesion segmentation technique in breast US with high accuracy even in presence of noises, artifacts and multiple lesions. This article presents a novel clustering method called Multi-scale Gaussian Kernel induced Fuzzy C-means (MsGKFCM) for segmentation of lesions in automatically extracted Region of Interest (ROI) in US to delimit the border of the mass. Further, a hybrid approach using MsGKFCM and Multi-scale Vector Field Convolution (MsVFC) is proposed to obtain an accurate lesion margin in breast US images. Initially, the images are filtered using speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion (SRAD) technique. Subsequently, MsGKFCM is applied on filtered images to segment the mass and detect an appropriate cluster center. The detected cluster center is further used by MsVFC to determine the accurate lesion margin. The proposed technique is evaluated on 127 US images using measures such as Jaccard Index, Dice similarity, Shape similarity, Hausdroff difference, Area difference, Accuracy, F-measure and analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. The empirical results suggest that the proposed approach can be used as an expert system to assist medical professionals by providing objective evidences in breast lesion detection. Results obtained are so far looking promising and effective in comparison to state of the art algorithms (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd, All rights reserved.

AB It is a quite important step to find object edges in applications such as object recognition, classification and segmentation. Therefore, the edge detection algorithm to be used directly influences the performance of these applications. In this study, a new edge detection method based on Neutrosophic Set (NS) structure via using maximum norm entropy (EDA-NMNE) is proposed. Many experts and intelligence systems, including the fuzzy system, do not satisfactorily succeed in resolving indeterminacies and deficiencies. However, in the NS approach, problems are solved by dividing them into True (T), False (F) and Indeterminacy (I) subsets. In addition, because the approach has a powerful algorithmic structure, NS's conditions with indeterminate and missing situations can be solved successfully. In this study, object edges can be found successfully with the proposed approach because edges of the object are considered as indeterminate. Thus, using the proposed EDA-NMNE, a strong intelligent expert system-based edge finding software was designed. In our study, 5 different object edge detection results were obtained by converting 5 different types of entropy into NS-based edge detection software. Thus, edge detection analysis has been performed by experimenting many types of entropy that have not been previously used for NS edge detection. The Metric Figure of Merit (FOM), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) analysis, mean square error (MSE) were used in this experimental study. Based on these results, highest FOM and PSNR values are obtained by using NORM entropy. In addition, the proposed edge detection approach were compared with Edge Detection Approach via Canny (EDA-C), Edge Detection Approach via Sobel (EDA-S), Edge Detection Approach via Variation-Adaptive Ant Colony Optimization (EDA-VAACO) and Edge Detection Approach via Active Contour without Edge (EDA-ACWE). FOM and PSNR tests have been used to evaluate the edge detection results obtained via 5 different methods. The findings demonstrated that the performance of the proposed edge detection approach is more successful compared to other methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Causal relation extraction is a challenging yet very important task for Natural Language Processing (NLP). There are many existing approaches developed to tackle this task, either rule-based (non-statistical) or machine-learning-based (statistical) method. For rule-based method, extensive manual work is required to construct handcrafted patterns, however, the precision and recall are low due to the complexity of causal relation expressions in natural language. For machine-learning-based method, current approaches either rely on sophisticated feature engineering which is error-prone, or rely on large amount of labeled data which is impractical for causal relation extraction problem. To address the above issues, we propose a Knowledge-oriented Convolutional Neural Network (K-CNN) for causal relation extraction in this paper. K-CNN consists of a knowledge-oriented channel that incorporates human prior knowledge to capture the linguistic clues of causal relationship, and a data-oriented channel that learns other important features of causal relation from the data. The convolutional filters in knowledge-oriented channel are automatically generated from lexical knowledge bases such as WordNet and FrameNet. We propose filter selection and clustering techniques to reduce dimensionality and improve the performance of K-CNN. Furthermore, additional semantic features that are useful for identifying causal relations are created. Three datasets have been used to evaluate the ability of K-CNN to effectively extract causal relation from texts, and the model outperforms current state-of-art models for relation extraction.

AB Human action recognition which needs video processing in real time, requires large memory size and execution time. This work proposes a local maxima of difference image (LMDI) based interest point detection technique, random projection tree with overlapping split and modified voting score for human action recognition. In LMDI based interest point detection method, difference images are obtained using consecutive frame differencing technique and next, 3D peak detection is applied on the bunch of calculated difference images. Histogram of oriented gradients and histogram of optical flow as local features are extracted by defining a block of size 16 x 16 around each of the interest point. These local features are then indexed by random projection trees. Overlapping split is used during tree structuring to reduce failure probability. Hough voting technique is applied on testing video to compute highest similarity matching score with individual training classes. In addition to Hough voting score, the number of matched interest points of a single query video with each training class, is considered for recognition. The proposed method is evaluated on segmented UT-interaction dataset, J-HMDB dataset and UCF101 dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed technique provides better performance compared to earlier reported techniques. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recommender systems based on methods such as collaborative and content-based filtering rely on extensive user profiles and item descriptors as well as on an extensive history of user preferences. Such methods face a number of challenges; including the cold-start problem in systems characterized by irregular usage, privacy concerns, and contexts where the range of indicators representing user interests is limited. We describe a recommender algorithm that builds a model of collective preferences independently of personal user interests and does not require a complex system of ratings. The performance of the algorithm is analyzed on a large transactional data set generated by a real-world dietary intake recall system. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Knowledge extraction and incorporation is currently considered to be beneficial for efficient Big Data analytics. Knowledge can take part in workflow design, constraint definition, parameter selection and configuration, human interactive and decision-making strategies. This paper proposes BIGOWL, an ontology to support knowledge management in Big Data analytics. BIGOWL is designed to cover a wide vocabulary of terms concerning Big Data analytics workflows, including their components and how they are connected, from data sources to the analytics visualization. It also takes into consideration aspects such as parameters, restrictions and formats. This ontology defines not only the taxonomic relationships between the different concepts, but also instances representing specific individuals to guide the users in the design of Big Data analytics workflows. For testing purposes, two case studies are developed, which consists in: first, real-world streaming processing with Spark of traffic Open Data, for route optimization in urban environment of New York city; and second, data mining classification of an academic dataset on local/cloud platforms. The analytics workflows resulting from the BIGOWL semantic model are validated and successfully evaluated. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The difference in data distributions among related, but different domains is a long standing problem for knowledge adaptation. A new method to transform the source domain knowledge to fit the target domain is proposed in this work. The proposed method uses deep learning method and limited number of samples from target domain to transform the source domain dataset. It treats the limited samples of target domain as seeds for initiating the transfer of source knowledge. Comprehensive experiments are conducted using different computational intelligence models and different datasets. Obtained results reveal that prediction models trained using the proposed method demonstrate the best performance in comparison with the same models trained with only source knowledge or deep learned features. Experiments show that models trained using proposed method have outperformed the baseline methods by at least 50% in 14 experiments out of a total of 18. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To manage voluminous viewed videos, which US adults watch at a rate of more than five hours per day on average, an automatic method of detecting highly attended video segments during video viewing is required to access them for fine-grained sharing and rewatching. Most electroencephalography (EEG) based studies of user state analysis have addressed the recognition of attention-related states in a specific task condition, such as drowsiness during driving, attention during learning, and mental fatigue during task execution. In contrast to attention in a specific task condition, both inattention and normal attention are meaningless to viewers in terms of managing viewed videos, while detecting high attention paid to video segments would make a valuable contribution to an automatic management system of viewed videos based on viewer attention. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first EEG-based study of detecting viewer attention paid to video segments. This study describes how to collect video-induced EEG and attention data for video segments from viewers without bias to specific genres and how to construct a subject-independent detection model for the top 20% of viewer attention. The attention detection model using the proposed interval EEG features from 14 channels achieved the best average F1 score of 39.79% with an average accuracy of 52.96%. Additionally, this paper proposes a channel-based feature selection method that considers both the performances of single-channel models and their physical locations for investigating the group of channels relevant to attention detection. The attention detection models using the interval EEG features from all four or some of the channels located in the fronto-central, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes of the left hemisphere achieved the best F1 score of 39.60% with an average accuracy of 48.70%. It is shown that these models aehieve better performance than models using the features from all four or some of their symmetric channels in the right hemisphere and models using the features from six channels located in the anterior-frontal and frontal lobes of the left and right hemispheres. This paper shows the feasibility of subject-independent and genre-independent attention detection models using a wireless EEG headset with optimized channels: these models can be applied to an intelligent video management system based on viewer attention in real-world scenarios.

AB Various classifiers for scent classification based on measurements using an electronic nose (eNose) have been studied recently. In general, classifiers rely on a static database containing reference eNose measurements for known scents. However, most of these approaches require retraining of the classifier every time a new scent needs to be added to the training database. In this paper, the potential of a K nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier is investigated to avoid the time-consuming retraining when updating the database. To speed up classification, a k-dimensional tree search in the KNN classifier and principal component analysis (PCA) are studied. The tests with scents presented to an eNose based on ion-mobility spectrometry (IMS) show that the KNN method classifies scents with high accuracy. Using a k-dimensional tree search instead of an exhaustive search has no significant influence on the misclassification rate but reduces the classification time considerably. The use of PCA-transformed data results in a higher misclassification rate than the use of IMS data when only the first principal components explaining 95% of the total variance are used but in a similar misclassification rate when the first principal components explaining 99% of the total variance are used. In conclusion, the proposed method can be recommended for classifying scents measured with IMS-based eNoses. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A main concern of risk management in financial institutions is measurement of operational risk and its value at risk as a requirement of Basel II accord. Besides risk quantification, identifying causal mechanism leading to operational loss is necessary to plan risk mitigation activities. Bayesian belief networks (BBN) is a causal modelling method able to achieve both goals simultaneously. Eliciting BBN causal model and its parameters from expert knowledge is an alternative to data driven models in case of data scarcity. However, there is still a problem with parameter extraction for complex models with a number of multi parent and multi state nodes. In this paper, we proposed a method combining fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) and BBN in order to improve BBN capability in modelling operational risks. In the first phase, a causal model is constructed by applying FCM and then a new migration method is proposed to translate FCM parameters to BBN ones. A case study of an Iranian private bank is then given to examine and validate the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The multi-echelon location-routing problems (LRPs) arise from transportation applications such as distribution systems of supply chains in city logistics. The literature review shows that most of the previous studies on location-routing in supply chains involve two-echelon LRPs. The main objective of this study is to develop a two-phase method based on improved Clarke and Wright savings algorithm for three echelon and four-echelon LRPs. Computational experiments show that compared with other methods, the proposed method can obtain the solution for two LRPs in a shorter time. Moreover, computational experiments show this method can solve three and four location-routing problems in reasonable time. The study also provides managerial insights on the proposed models and method. Finally, the limitations on models and method as well as future research directions are given. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Forecasting stock returns is an exacting prospect in the context of financial time series. This study proposes a unique decision-making model for day trading investments on the stock market. In this regard, the model was developed using a fusion approach of a classifier based on machine learning, with the support vector machine (SVM) method, and the mean-variance (MV) method for portfolio selection. The model's experimental evaluation was based on assets from the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange Index (Ibovespa). Monthly rolling windows were used to choose the best-performing parameter sets (the in sample phase) and testing (the out-of-sample phase). The monthly windows were composed of daily rolling windows, with new training of the classifying algorithm and portfolio optimization. A total of 81 parameter arrangements were formulated. To compare the proposed model's performance, two other models were suggested: (i) SVM +1/N, which maintained the process of classifying the trends of the assets that reached a certain target of gain and which invested equally in all assets that had positive signals in their classifications, and (ii) Random +MV, which also maintained the selection of those assets with a tendency to reach a certain target of gain, but where the selection was randomly defined. Then, the portfolio's composition was determined using the MV method. Together, the alternative models registered 36 parameter variations. In addition to these two models, the results were also compared with the lbovespa's performance. The experiments were formulated using historical data for 3716 trading days for the out-of-sample analysis. Simulations were conducted without including transaction costs and also with the inclusion of a proportion of such costs. We specifically analyzed the effect of brokerage costs on buying and selling stocks on the Brazilian market. This study also evaluated the classifier's performance, portfolios' cardinality, and models' returns and risks. The proposed main model showed significant results, although demand for trading value can be a limiting factor for its implementation. Nonetheless, this study extends the theoretical application of machine learning and offers a potentially practical approach to anticipating stock prices. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Bayesian optimization; Transfer learning; Gaussian process
AB Experimental optimization is prevalent in many areas of artificial intelligence including machine learning. Conventional methods like grid search and random search can be computationally demanding. Over the recent years, Bayesian optimization has emerged as an efficient technique for global optimization of black-box functions. However, a generic Bayesian optimization algorithm suffers from a "cold start" problem. It may struggle to find promising locations in the initial stages. We propose a novel transfer learning method for Bayesian optimization where we leverage the knowledge from an already completed source optimization task for the optimization of a target task. Assuming both the source and target functions lie in some proximity to each other, we model source data as noisy observations of the target function. The level of noise models the proximity or relatedness between the tasks. We provide a mechanism to compute the noise level from the data to automatically adjust for different relatedness between the source and target tasks. We then analyse the convergence properties of the proposed method using two popular acquisition functions. Our theoretical results show that the proposed method converges faster than a generic no-transfer Bayesian optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method empirically on the tasks of tuning the hyperparameters of three different machine learning algorithms. In all the experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art transfer learning and no-transfer Bayesian optimization methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Machine learning approaches are largely focused on pattern or object classification, where a combination of several classifier systems can be integrated to help generate an optimal or suboptimal classification decision. Multiple classification systems have been extensively developed because a committee of classifiers, also known as an ensemble, can outperform the ensemble's individual members. In this paper, a classification method based on an ensemble of binary classifiers is proposed. Our strategy consists of two phases: (1) the competence of the base heterogeneous classifiers in a pool is determined, and (2) an ensemble is formed by combining those base classifiers with the greatest competences for the given input data.
   We have shown that the competence of the base classifiers can be successfully calculated even if the number of their learning examples was limited. Such a situation is particularly observed with biometric data. In this paper, we propose a new biometric data structure, the Sim coefficients, along with an efficient data processing technique involving a pool of competent classifiers chosen by dynamic selection.

AB Managerial decision-making often involves the consideration of multiple criteria with high levels of uncertainty. Multi-attribute utility theory, a primary method proposed for decision-making under uncertainty, has been repeatedly shown to be difficult to use in practice. This paper presents a novel approach termed Simulated Uncertainty Range Evaluations (SURE) to aid decision makers in the presence of high levels of uncertainty. SURE has evolved from an existing method that has been applied extensively in the pharmaceutical and speciality chemical sectors involving uncertain decisions in whole process design. The new method utilises simulations based upon triangular distributions to create a plot which visualises the preferences and overlapping uncertainties of decision alternatives. It facilitates decision-makers to visualise the not-so-obvious uncertainties of decision alternatives. In a real-world case study for a large pharmaceutical company, SURE was compared to other widely-used methods for decision-making and was the only method that correctly identified the alternative eventually chosen by the company. The case study demonstrates that SURE can perform better than other existing methods for decision-making involving multiple criteria and uncertainty. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper focuses on the development of a prognostic scheme for estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of Lithium-ion batteries with missing observations. The scheme has two main modules based on extreme learning machines: pre-processing and prediction. The pre-processing module uses novel single and multiple imputation techniques to estimate the missing observations. The prediction module aims to obtain precise predictions even in the presence of missing observations and with the related uncertainty. The pre-processing module sends imputed subsets of samples to the prediction module, which makes use of extreme learning machines for one-step and multi-steps predictions. The prediction module contains various multi-steps prediction strategies including iterative, direct and DirRec, which use the constant-current experimental capacity data for the long-term prediction of the remaining useful life. Accurate prediction of RUL requires continuity in the time-series dataset. The proposed scheme is designed to build an intelligent prediction system with the ability to handle time-series data containing missing values and is robust enough to generate a complete time-series dataset and, then, make short or long term predictions. The experimental results confirm that the proposed framework can be beneficial for intelligent diagnostic and prognostic systems related to battery as well as other wide range of applications. The main focus of the paper is the development of an integrated imputation-prediction scheme and not the evaluation of individual performances of the imputation or prediction techniques.

AB Patulin (PAT) is one of the most common toxic contaminants of apple juice, which causes severe food safety issues throughout the apple industry. In order to remove PAT efficiently, a metal-organic framework-based adsorbent (UiO-66(NH2)@Au-Cys) was successfully synthesized and used for PAT removal from juice-pH simulation solution and real apple juice. Batch adsorption experiments were systematically performed to study the adsorption behavior for PAT. The results showed that adsorption process could be well described by the Pseudo-second order model and Freundlich isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacity (4.38 mu g/mg) was 10 times higher than the microbe-based biosorbents. Thermodynamic investigation demonstrated that adsorption process was spontaneous and endothermic. Furthermore, no marked cytotoxicity on NIH 3T3 cell lines was observed when the concentration of the adsorbent was lower than 10 mu g/mL. Therefore, UiO-66( NH2)@Au-Cys is a potential adsorbent for PAT removal from apple juice with little quality changes

AB An automated and miniaturized chemiluminescence method for screening of fluoroquinolones in milk samples was proposed. The method was based on magnetic dispersive micro-solid phase extraction of analytes followed by the chemiluminescence determination of the total fluoroquinolones content using a multi-pumping flow system. In the developed method, Zr-Fe-C magnetic nanoparticles were used as an efficient sorbent for separation of fluoroquinolones from sample matrix. The chemiluminescence intensity obtained for Ce4+-SO32--Tb3+ chemiluminescence system was greatly increased in the presence of the analytes. Under the optimal conditions, the detector response for fluoroquinolones was linear in the concentration ranges from 5 center dot 10(-9) to 1 center dot 10(-6) mol L-1 with respect to fleroxacin. The limit of detection, calculated from a blank test based on 3s, was 2 center dot 10(-9) mol L-1 with respect to fleroxacin. The presented method demonstrated to be a good tool for available and cost-effective point-of-need screening fluoroquinolones in milk samples.

AB Aromatic aroma compounds contribute to flavor of tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) and they are mostly derived from L-phenylalanine via trans-cinnamic acid or directly from L-phenylalanine. The objective of this study was to investigate whether an alternative pathway derived from L-phenylalanine via phenylpyruvic acid is involved in formation of aroma compounds in tea. Enzyme reaction with phenylpyruvic acid showed that benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, and methyl benzoate were derived from phenylpyruvic acid in tea leaves. Feeding experiments using [H-2(8)] L-phenylalanine indicated that phenylpyruvic acid was derived from L-phenylalanine in a reaction catalyzed by aromatic amino acid aminotransferases (AAATs). CsAAAT1 showed higher catalytic efficiency towards L-phenylalanine (p <= 0.001) while CsAAAT2 showed higher catalytic efficiency towards L-tyrosine (p <= 0.001). Both CsAAATs were localized in the cytoplasm of leaf cells. In conclusion, an alternative pathway for the formation of aromatic aroma compounds derived from L-phenylalanine via phenylpyruvic acid occurred in tea leaves.

AB This work was carried out to identify accurate methods that could be recommended for the quantification of proteins in food protein hydrolysates. Following hydrolysis with 4% alcalase, the amount of protein in various hydrolysate samples was measured using seven different analytical methods. Although the data obtained using different methods varied, HPLC amino acid analysis with a Pico-Tag column indicated that the highest concentration of amino acids in the protein hydrolysates was present in the casein sample while the lowest amount of protein was found in the sample of hempseed studied. However, the amino acid analysis data was mostly positively correlated with the Dumas and Lowry methods. We conclude that where available, amino acid analysis provides the best estimate of protein content of hydrolysates but the Dumas and Lowry methods can also be recommended as alternatives.

AB Strawberry fruit is a valuable resource, rich in vitamins and polyphenolic compounds. These compounds have a broad spectrum of biological activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative composition of polyphenols in strawberry fruit from 90 cultivars of Fragariaxananassa Duch. from two growing seasons. Eighty of them were analyzed for the first time (to the best of our knowledge). The identification of polyphenolics and other compounds was performed using UPLC-qTOF-MS/MS. Nine compounds were recorded for the first time in mature strawberry fruit. Antioxidant properties were also determined using DPPH and ABTS methods. Statistical analysis of the results was performed using principal component analysis. Tannins, especially ellagitannins with agrimoniin, as well as the total polyphenols, had the greatest influence on antioxidant activity in the ABTS test. Cultivars characterized by a high content of tannins and high antioxidant capacity were selected.

AB Targeted metabolomics aims to provide a new approach to investigate metabolites and gather both qualitative and quantitative information. We describe a protocol for extraction and analysis of plant metabolites, specifically 13 secondary metabolites (antioxidants) using liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), with high linearity (R2 > 0.99) and reproducibility (0.23-6.23 R%) with low limits of detection (> 0.001 ng/mL) and quantification (> 0.2 ng/mL). The protocol was applied to study the antioxidant response of cucumber plants exposed to nanocopper pesticide. Dose-dependent changes in antioxidant concentrations were found, and 10 antioxidants were significantly consumed to scavenge reactive oxygen species, protecting plants from damage. Levels of three antioxidants were up-regulated, as a response to the depletion of the other antioxidants, signaling activation of the defense system. We demonstrated that the reported LC-MS/MS method provides a quantitative analysis of antioxidants in plant tissues, for example to investigate interactions between plants and nanomaterials.

AB Buriti by-products flours were evaluated as sources of dietary fibers and natural antioxidants. All flours presented chemical characteristics that allowed classification as high dietary fiber powders. Presence of pectic polysaccharides, arabinoxylans and xyloglucans was inferred by the neutral monosaccharides profile. Peels and defatted pulp flours are highlighted as those with higher antioxidant potential (total extractable polyphenols and antioxidant activities by DPPH and FRAP) compared to endocarp and manually-produced bran flours. Carotenoids content were also higher in the peels flours. All produced flours showed expressive amounts of total non-extractable proanthocyanidins (NEPA). Buriti peels flours NEPA levels are among the highest values previously described in the literature. Blanching preserved the extractable polyphenols but not carotenoids or NEPA. Technological properties were influenced mainly by the size of the particles. Buriti by-products flours have potential to be used as sources of dietary fiber and natural antioxidants in food.

AB Nanoclusters of Ir were electrochemically deposited on carbon fiber paper (CFP) substrate modified with poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), a conducting polymer between the potential range 0.0 V and 0.6 V at 0.05 V/s scan rate. The electrocatalytic activity of Ir-PEDOT/CFP electrode towards oxidation of morin, a flavonoid was significantly greater than that of PEDOT/CFP and bare CFP electrodes. Factors affecting the anodic peak of morin namely, effect of pH, scan rate and number of cycles were optimized. The electrochemical route involved adsorption controlled and irreversible processes. Under optimal conditions, the linear dynamic range for the determination of morin was found to be 0.12 nM-2.80 nM. The significantly low detection limit (42.18 pM) demonstrates the ultrasensitivity of the proposed method. The reliability of the method was evaluated for the quantification of morin present in mulberry leaves, guava leaves and grape wine.

AB Novel starch-based nanoparticles from three sources: horse chestnut (HSC), water chestnut (WSC) and lotus stem (LSC) were prepared for nano-encapsulation of catechin. Average particle size of HSC, WSC and LSC based nanoparticles were 322.7, 559.2 and 615.6 nm with encapsulation efficiency of 59.09, 48.30, and 55.00% and negative zeta potential of -18.05, -21.5 and -18.05 mv, respectively. Structural, physical and thermal properties were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). SEM revealed capsule formation with entrapped catechin, while broad characteristic peaks at 3475, 1650, 1383, 1148, 1083 and 790 cm(-1) depicts encapsulation of catechin in starch nanoparticles without any evident interaction. XRD showed loss of crystallinity after encapsulation. Higher content of catechin in intestinal juice ensured controlled release in intestine. Bioactive properties were retained at higher level in encapsulated catechin compared to free catechin upon in-vitro digestion.

AB In this study, ultra-violet (UV) and short-wave infra-red (SWIR) hyperspectral imaging (HSI) was used to measure the concentration of phenolic flavour compounds on malted barley that are responsible for smoky aroma of Scotch whisky. UV-HSI is a relatively unexplored technique that has the potential to detect specific absorptions of phenols. SWIR-HSI has proven to detect phenols in previous applications. Support Vector Machine Classification and Regression was applied to classify malts with ten different concentration levels of the compounds of interest, and to estimate the concentration respectively. Results reveal that UV-HSI is at its current development stage unsuitable for this task whereas SWIR-HSI is able to produce robust results with a classification accuracy of 99.8% and a squared correlation coefficient of 0.98 with a Root Mean Squared Error of 0.32 ppm for regression. The results indicate that with further testing and development, HSI may potentially be exploited in an industrial production environment.

AB The effects of a novel technology utilizing a simultaneous combination of Ultraviolet-C radiation and ultrasound energy postharvest treatment on tomato bioactive compounds during 28 days' storage period was investigated by varying Ultraviolet-C radiation intensities of 639.37 or 897.16 mu W/cm(2) at a constant ultrasound intensity of 13.87 W/L from a 40 kHz-1 kW transducer. A minimal treatment time of 240s at Ultraviolet-C dosage of 2.15 kJ/m(2) was observed to provoke a considerable increase in bioactive compounds content, proportionated to treatment time. Although treatment led to temperature increase in the system reaching 39.33 degrees C due to heat generation by ultrasonic cavitation, the extractability and biosynthesis of phytochemicals were enhanced resulting in 90%, 30%, 60%, 20%, and 36% increases in lycopene, total phenols, vitamin C, hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activities respectively. Results present the potential use of the combined non-thermal technologies as post-harvest treatment to improve bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity during storage.

AB We analysed the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of phenolic metabolites secreted from a naringenin-producing Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain (a GRAS organism), against the pure flavonoid naringenin and its prenylated derivatives, to assess their potential as natural food preservatives. Agar disc diffusion assay was used to analyse the antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, while DMPD center dot chemiluminescence assay was used to analyse antioxidant activity, based on DMPD center dot(+)-scavenging activity. Our results showed that the engineered yeast metabolites exhibited both strong antimicrobial and DMPD center dot(+)-scavenging activity, particularly the metabolite phenylacetaldehyde. Pure naringenin had poor antimicrobial and DMPD center dot(+)-scavenging effects. Prenylated varieties, 6-prenylnaringenin and 8-prenylnaringenin, inhibited only S. aureus, while only 8-prenylnaringenin exhibited moderate DMPD center dot(+)-scavenging activity. Our results suggested that phenolic metabolites secreted from naringenin-producing yeast would be a sustainable source of natural food preservatives.

AB Ultrasensitive immunoassays, including an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ic-ELISA) and a lateral-flow immunochromatographic assay (ICA), were developed based on a monoclonal antibody for the analysis of deoxynivalenol in food and feed samples. With 0.01 M PBS, 20% ethanol-PBS, and 60% ethanol-PBS extraction, which are environmentally safe, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) and limit of detection (LOD) values were 1.83-4.68 mu g/kg and 0.241-0.664 mu g/kg, respectively, with recovery rates of 87.7%-137% and coefficient variation values of 3.99-9.88% (intra-assay) and 4.17-9.81% (inter-assay) for the ic-ELISA relative to the results obtained by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). For the ICA strip, the visual LODs were 10-150 mu g/kg, the cut-off values were 50-750 mu g/kg, and the calculated LODs were 1.97-46.8 mu g/kg, with different sample extraction solutions, and the recovery rates were 66.7%-127%. These methods are sensitive, simple and safe, providing an auxiliary analytical tool for screening the massive samples in markets.

AB Particles from Gas-Saturated Solutions (PGSS)-drying has been used as a green alternative to encapsulate omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) at mild, non-oxidative conditions. PGSS-dried particles have been compared to those obtained by conventional drying methods such as spray-drying and freeze-drying, finding encapsulation efficiencies (EE) up to 98% and spherical morphology for PGSS- and spray-dried particles. Freeze-dried powders showed irregular morphology and EE from 95.8 to 98.6%, depending on the freezing method. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis revealed glass-transition and melting peaks of OSA-starch and a cold-crystallization peak corresponding to the encapsulated n-3 PUFA concentrate. Compared to conventionally dried powders, PGSS-dried microparticles showed lower primary and secondary oxidation after 28 days of storage at 4 degrees C. Ascorbic acid addition combined with the mild processing conditions of PGSS-drying yielded particles with a maximum peroxide value of 2.5 meq O-2/kg oil after 28 days of storage at 4 degrees C.

AB Subcritical water extraction is an eco-friendly method for the extraction of less polar compounds without the use of organic solvents. This study determined the extraction conditions that maximize the contents of 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol obtained from ginger pulp and peel. The highest yields of 6-gingerol (0.68 +/- 0.08 mg/g), and 6-shogaol (0.39 +/- 0.03 mg/g) were obtained from ginger pulp at the extraction conditions of 130 degrees C/25 min, and 190 degrees C/15 min. 6-Shogaol content increased with the increasing extraction temperature and extraction time due to the conversion of 6-gingerol to 6-shogaol by thermal cracking. The antioxidant activity of ginger extracts were increased depending on the increasing of 6-shogaol content.

AB With the widespread application of synthetic pigments in the food industry, food safety incidents caused by illegal addition of pigments have become more frequent. In this study, we synthesized core-shell nanomaterials for use in sensitive, fast, convenient, nondestructive detection and having good surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect. The optimal synthetic conditions were selected to study semi-quantitative detection. Calculations for acid orange II and brilliant blue were done using density functional theory, and the characteristic peaks and vibration conditions for each pigment were identified. Acid orange II and brilliant blue in the food samples yellow croaker, braised pork, red pepper, green dumpling, and red wine were detected by SERS screening. Results were compared with those obtained by standard high-performance liquid chromatography method in order to verify the SERS method. The core-shell nanoparticles showed good performance in the rapid detection of pigments in food.

AB An analytical method based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed for the first simultaneous determination of ten neonicotinoid insecticides (pymetrozine, dinotefuran, nitenpyram, thiamethoxam, flonicamid, imidacloprid, clothianidin, imidaclothiz, acetamiprid, thiacloprid) and two metabolites (4-trifluoromethylnicotinamide and N-desmethylacetamiprid) in honey and royal-jelly. The quantitative detection was performed by LC-MS/MS on multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode under positive-ion electrospray ionization. The isotope dilution internal standard method or external standard method was used for quantitation analysis. The limits of quantification (LOQs), calculated as 10 times the standard deviation, were 0.25-5.0 mu g kg(-1) for ten neonicotinoid insecticides and two metabolites. The average recoveries were in the range of 72.8-106.5%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) below 13.8%, measured at three concentration levels. The developed method exhibits a high sensitivity and suitable for the simultaneous determination of neonicotinoid insecticides and metabolites in honey and royal-jelly.

AB Interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) is an effective method to improve functional properties of hydrogels by forming cross-linking networks. In this study, the gelatin-alginate gels formed by the combination of enzymatic and ionic cross-linking were called IPN gels. Meanwhile, the gels with the treatment of only transglutaminase (TG) or Ca2+ were named as G-semi-IPN and A-semi-IPN, respectively. The formation of semi-IPN and IPN was confirmed by studies on rheology, thermodynamics and micro-morphology. The results showed that the IPN gels had improved gelling properties and structural stability. The functional properties of different gelatin-alginate gels were also investigated. It was firstly found that the IPN gels could enhance mechanical properties, decrease swelling capacity and had better bile acid binding capacity. These results of gelatin-alginate gels provide references and novel prospects of IPN for the application in the field of food industry.

AB This study aimed to investigate the effects of acidic electrolyzed oxidizing water (AEW) treatment on storability and metabolism of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in blueberries cv. 'Brightwell' during storage at 4 degrees C. Results showed that, compared with the control blueberries, AEW treated-blueberries exhibited lower incidence of fruit decay, higher rate of commercially acceptable fruit, higher fruit firmness and skin hardness, and higher anthocyanin and total phenolics contents, along with higher activities of SOD, CAT and APX, higher antioxidant activity, but lower generation rate of superoxide anion and cell membrane permeability. These results demonstrated that AEW treatment for enhancing storability of harvested blueberries during storage may be mediated by regulating ROS metabolism, manifested as AEW increasing ROS scavenging capacity and reducing ROS accumulation, and thereby maintained the structural integrity of cellular membrane, which indicated that AEW treatment was a facile postharvest method for extending the shelf life of harvested blueberries.

AB Lipid-soluble pigments make great contributions to the color of green tea. This study aimed to rapidly and simultaneously measure six main types of lipid-soluble pigments in green tea by using the visible and near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy. A total of 135 tea samples with five kinds and three grades were collected for spectral scanning and color measurement, and their lipid-soluble pigments contents were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. It can be found that tea color was closely related to the six pigments. And there were significant differences in lipid-soluble pigments contents among these kinds and grades. Finally, quantitative determination models of the six pigments obtained excellent results with R-p(2) of 0.975, 0.973, 0.993, 0.919, 0.962 and 0.965 respectively based on multiple linear regression with the characteristic wavelengths. These results demonstrated that the Vis-NIR spectroscopy combined with chemometrics is a powerful tool for rapid determination of lipid-soluble pigments in green tea.

AB Mung bean Protein hydrolyses (MBPHs) have attracted a great deal of attention due to their variety of biological activities. In present study, MBPHs were fractionate according to the molecular mass into three fractions of MBPHs-I (< 3 kDa), MBPHs-II (3-10 kDa) and MBPHs-III (> 10 kDa). Their antioxidant activity and angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory of were investigated in vitro. Results showed that the alcalase-derived hydrolysate exhibited the highest degree of hydrolysis (DH) and trichloroacetic acid-nitrogen soluble index (TCA-NSI) versus those of other enzyme hydrolysates. MBPHs-I presented the best scavenge DPPH, hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals, Fe2+ chelating activities, and the best ACE inhibitory activity (IC50 = 4.66 mu g/mL) than that of MBPHs and MBPHs-III. And MBPHs-I rich in hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids, and its secondary structure mainly contain alpha-helix, beta-sheet and irregular coiled. Results indicated that MBPHs-I has a great potential as natural functional materials for supplement.

AB Herein, the protein binding rates of structurally different flavonoids to human serum albumin (HSA) were elucidated by applying the high performance affinity chromatography (HPAC). The flavonoids with hydroxyl groups on ring A showed a higher protein binding rate compared with those that there was no hydroxyl on ring A. However, the hydroxylation of ring B lowered the protein binding rate. It was also found that an additional methoxy group in flavone ring A would decrease the protein binding rate. Nevertheless, the methoxy group in flavanone ring A (position 6) and isoflavone ring B (position 4') increased the protein binding rate. Methoxy group at other positions of flavonoids slightly enhanced or no significantly affected the binding rates on human serum albumin. Hydrogenation of C2=C3 double bond of flavonoids decreased the protein binding rate and had the same effect as glycosylation which decrease the protein binding rate by 5%-25%.

AB Wines from different grape varieties, geographical zones, soil types, foliar N application, SO2 addition and oak ageing were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). For this purpose, ICP-MS methodology was optimized. The elements which allowed differentiate wines from studied grape varieties were Sr, Ca, Mg and Mn. Geographical zones were classified according to Sr, Ba, Ni, and Cu. Cs and Pb were the main elements to discriminate the wines from the 3 soil types. Wines from several N foliar doses application were classified by Pb, Ni, Mn and Zn. The content of Cs, Mg, Cu and Pb in wines characterized the SO2 addition. Finally, wines storage in barrels were differentiate by Na and Cs concentration. The discriminant functions classify 100% of the wines, with the exception of grape variety (97.0%) and oak ageing (95.8%). Consequently, ICP-MS can be applied to classified wines according to viticultural and oenological factors.

AB By combination of the aptamer biorecognition with the colorimetric signal transduction of a DNAzyme-functionalized nanoprobe, a new biosensing method was developed for the rapid and sensitive detection of chloramphenicol (CAP). The nanoprobe was prepared through the functionalization of gold nanoparticles with the complementary oligonucleotide against aptamer and high-content hemin/G-quadruplex DNAzyme. When one-step incubating the nanoprobe and CAP at a constructed aptamer-magnetic bead (MB) biosensing platform, due to the competitive biorecognition reaction, the nanoprobes related with CAP amounts were quantitative captured onto the MB surface. Based on the catalytic reaction of the peroxidase-mimicking DNAzyme, a colored substance was produced for the colorimetric signal transduction of the method. Due to the great signal amplification of the nanoprobe, a very low detection limit down to 0.13 pg/mL was obtained. Considering the excellent performance of the aptasensing method and satisfactory results for milk sample experiments, it indicates good reliability for practical applications.

AB In the present study, we evaluated the concentrations of several micronutrients and heavy metals (Fe, Mg, Mn, K, Ca, Na, Zn, Cu, Ni and Cd) in soils and in edible parts of two vegetables (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Amal) and (Lactuca sativa L. cv Augusta) and a fruit (Fragaria x ananassa cv. Sabrina) from conventional and organic farming in the eastern-central region of Tunisia. A principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to investigate correlations between metals in the edible part of the crops and metals in soil. The bio-concentration factors (BCF) were calculated to evaluate the ability of plants to absorb nutrients from the soil. Our data indicated a significant decrease in micronutrients in the edible part of crops from organic farming. However, toxic metals loads significantly increased in crops from conventional agriculture. Our data should be carefully considered in view of the potential health risk assessment for Tunisian consumers.

AB The diversity found among the Vitis vinifera L. species allows the production of wines with very different characteristics. The development of platforms suitable for food composition analysis is currently an emerging area. Among these, DNA biosensors have been developed for a wide variety of applications, ranging from food safety to authenticity. The main aim of this work was to study the detection capacity of the DNA-based optical biosensor using different V. vinifera matrices (leaf, must and wine). Genomic DNA was extracted from leaf, must and wine of three V. vinifera varieties and was tested on the long-period grating (LPG) DNA-based biosensor developed within our group. The biosensor was able to distinguish the varieties even using DNA extracted from complex matrices, revealing its potential to be applied in wine authenticity.

AB Myricanol is a diarylheptanoid isolated from Chinese bayberry. Through virtual docking strategy, myricanol was discovered as an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator among a series of structural analogs, with high affinity for the. subunit of AMPK. Myricanol was also evaluated for regulatory effects on lipid accumulation and insulin sensitivity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and adiposity in high-fat diet-fed zebrafish. Myricanol suppressed lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells in the initial stage (days 0-2) by suppressing adipogenesis and in the terminal stage (days 4-7) by inducing lipolysis and lipid combustion through activating AMPK. Moreover, myricanol enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by activating the insulin signaling pathway. In high-fat diet-fed zebrafish, myricanol inhibited lipid accumulation by suppressing adipogenic factors including peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha). In summary, the results indicate that myricanol could be a potential therapeutic agent against obesity by activating the AMPK signaling pathway.

AB A number of studies were devoted to understanding an immunological effect of pressure-treated beta-lactoglobulin. In our previous work we have proved that high pressure significantly modifies beta-lactoglobulin conformation and consequently its physicochemical properties. Here, structure of beta-lactoglobulin complex with myristic acid determined at the highest accepted by the crystal pressure value of 550 MPa is reported. Our results structurally prove that pressure noticeably modifies positions of the major beta-lactoglobulin epitopes. Considering the biological impact of observed changes in epitope regions, high pressure beta-lactoglobulin structure presents a step forward in understanding the pressure modification of food protein allergenicity. The conformational changes of pressurized beta-lactoglobulin did not support the hypothesis that proteolytic digestion facilitated by pressure is caused by an exposure of the digestive sites. Our findings demonstrate that high pressure protein crystallography can potentially identify the most pressure-sensitive fragments in allergens, and can therefore support development of hypoallergenic food products.

AB Spectroscopy techniques to efficiently measure phenolic composition in grape berries may be a suitable analytical practice, provided that robust calibrations are established. A contactless FT-NIR instrument was used for on-line spectral data collection from grapes transported on a conveyor belt system. Spectral data was also collected on static samples using the same NIR instrument. Spectral measurements of crushed berries captured from the conveyor belt system and the use of the homogenate extraction protocol as reference method provided the most accurate prediction models. Values obtained for errors in prediction (RMSEP%) and RPD were 12% and 2.37, 12.3% and 3.37, 7.8% and 3.2, 16.7% and 2.84 for tannins (mg/g) and anthocyanins (mg/g) on a fresh weight basis, total phenols and colour density (AU), respectively. The results observed in this study show the ability of NIR spectroscopy to monitor the phenolic composition of grape berries transported on a conveyor belt system online.

AB The aim of this study was to synthesize stearidonic acid (SDA)-rich triacylglycerol (TAG) via a two-step lipase-catalyzed esterification under vacuum. SDA-rich fatty acid, which was prepared from echium oil via Candida rugosa lipase-catalyzed selective esterification, was used as the substrate. Two different immobilized lipases, Novozym 435 from Candida antarctica and Lipozyme TL IM from Thermomyces lanuginosus, were employed for the synthesis of SDA-rich TAG. In the first step, Novozym 435-catalyzed esterification of the SDA-rich fatty acid with glycerol was carried out for 2 h. In the second step, Lipozyme TL IM-catalyzed esterification of the reaction mixture from the first step was performed for an additional 10 h. The optimal reaction conditions for the second step were a temperature of 65 degrees C, an enzyme loading of 20%, and a vacuum of 0.7 kPa. Consequently, the maximum TAG conversion of ca. 86.4 wt% was obtained after 12 h via a two-step lipase-catalyzed esterification.

AB Salted fermented fruit known as asam sunti (Averrhoa bilimbi L.) in Indonesia has been used as a source of umami taste. This study was aimed to characterize the three types of asam sunti and their water soluble extracts, and to trace the compounds responsible for umami taste in umami fractions. Umami fractions were obtained by ultrafiltration followed by Sephadex G-15 chromatographic separation. The three types of samples could be differentiated by physicochemical and sensory analyses. Low molecular weight fraction had the highest umami intensity. Further chromatographic separation revealed three umami fractions, F-II, III and IV. Umami taste of F-III was due to the presence of free L-glutamic acid at 6 times, while FII and FIV were due to succinic acid at more than 30 times their respective umami thresholds. Organic acid as well as amino acid seemed to play an important role in the intense umami taste of asam sunti.

AB Volatile profiles of jujube fruits at different ripening stages were characterized by GC-MS and E-nose. Changes in the possible precursors of volatile components were also investigated. Four ripening stages were established: GM, green maturity; YM, yellow maturity; HRM, half-red maturity; RM, red maturity. Fruit maturity showed significant effect on the volatile components and their precursors. (E)-2-hexenal was the most abundant component which showed rising trend from 169.2 mu g/kg (GM) to 733.4 mu g/kg (RM). Glucose and fructose showed a decreasing tendency during ripening. As the important precursors of jujube flavor, seven fatty acids were identified, the predominant ones were C-16:0, C-16:1n7, C-18:1n9c and C-18:2n6c; twenty-six free amino acids were quantified, in which L-AspNH(2) and L-Pro were the abundant components. Owing to the highest content of total aldehydes (59.33%) and the strongest responses of E-nose, jujubes at HRM stage showed superior overall flavor quality among all the samples.

AB Qualitative and quantitative determination of total arsenic content and arsenic species in rice is very important because rice is one of the main sources of human arsenic intake. However, extraction and determination of arsenic species in rice has been very difficult due to severe matrix interference. An alternative analytical method was developed in this study to determine arsenic species in rice by using ion chromatography coupled to inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Two internal standards were used. The first internal standard was injected before sample introduction to correct signal change with time. The second internal standard was spiked into the sample to reduce matrix interference. Using the developed method, recoveries of dimethylarsinic acid, monomethylarsonic acid, and inorganic arsenic compared to certified values (NIST SRM 1568b rice flour) were 116%, 107%, and 92%, respectively.

AB Volatile compounds determine the aroma of fruits, giving their unique flavor characteristics. The aim of many plant breeding projects is to improve the consumers' flavor experience when eating fresh produce. Large scale breeding trials produce thousands of samples which need volatile profiling amongst other phenotypes. Despite this interest, current methods have limitations: sampling unsuitable for field conditions, high cost and the inherent issue of highly variable data, which can hinder interpretation. We introduced a simple and robust sampling methodology based on silicone rod extraction, thermal desorption gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to address these issues. We used differentiated calibration standards to generate quantitative data for metabolites of varying abundance. The method was used to profile 327 melons with high sensitivity (0.05-10 ng/mL, compound dependent), good reproducibility (7%) and differentiate melon varieties based on their volatile profile. The data were then used for line selection for a desired flavor profile.

AB Fungal bunch rot of grapes leads to production of detrimental flavour compounds, some of which are well characterised but others remain unidentified. The current study uses an untargeted metabolomics approach to classify volatile profiles of grape juices based on the presence of different fungal pathogens. Individual grape berries were inoculated with Botrytis cinerea, Penicillium expansum, Aspergillus niger or A. carbonarius. Grape bunches were inoculated and blended with healthy fruit, to provide 10% (w/w) infected juice. Juices from the above sample batches were analysed by GC/MS. PLS-DA of the normalised summed mass ions indicated sample classification according to pathogen. Compounds identified from those mass ion matrices that had high discriminative value for classification included 1,5-dimethylnaphthalene and several unidentified sesquiterpenes that were relatively higher in B. cinerea infected samples. A. niger and A. carbonarius samples were relatively higher in 2-(4-hexyl-2,5-dioxo-2,5-dihydrofuran-3-yl) acetic acid, while P. expansum samples were higher in gamma-nonalactone and m-cresol.

AB The color change of the jujube fruit after harvest is used as a quality indicator. The effects of abscisic acid (ABA) and a chitosan/nano-silica/ sodium alginate composite film on the color development and qualitative properties of harvested jujube in cold storage were investigated. The results indicate that a composite film could prolong the shelf life of post-harvested winter jujube for approximately 1 month, while the ABA treatment induced ripening and reduced the quality. A significant positive correlation between the a*/b* values, water loss and the malondialdehyde (MDA) content was found for fruits in cold storage. In comparison with the control and ABA-treated fruit, superoxide dismutase (SOD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) activities were lower than those in a composite film-treated fruit. In addition, the dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFR) is the primary gene that regulates the expression of anthocyanin.

AB Sanguinello and Tarocco (Citrus sinensis [L.] Osbeck) are the most common and widespread blood oranges varieties in the Mediterranean climate area. Its interest is increasing mainly due to nutritional and organoleptic properties. In this work, three blood orange varieties cultivated in Spain (Sanguinelli, Tarocco Rosso and Tarocco Ippolito) were characterized in relation to physicochemical parameters and relevant bioactive compounds (vitamin C, organic acids, flavonoids and anthocyanins) as well as colour characterization. All samples showed important vitamin C values (higher than 54.9 mg/100 g of edible portion). Flavonoids represent the largest family of phenolic compounds, being hesperidin, the major flavonoid. Ten different anthocyanins were identified in blood oranges, seven cyanidin derivatives and three delphinidin derivatives, being the most abundant cyanidin 3-(6 ''-malonylglucoside) and cyanidin 3-glucoside. Blood oranges can show an intense reddish colour in peel whereas the pulp has a yellow-orange colour. Overall, these varieties are good sources of bioactive compounds.

AB Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOF-MS) was combined with conventional mono-dimensional GC-MS to differentiate Croatian virgin olive oils (VOO) according to variety and geographical origin, based on the profile of volatile aroma compounds isolated by HS-SPME. More than 1000 compounds were detected after untargeted profiling and 256 were identified or tentatively identified, providing one of the most detailed profiles of volatile aroma compounds in VOO up to date. Among them, 131 volatile compounds were significantly different across monovarietal VOOs, while 60 were found useful for the discrimination according to geographical origin. Many major lipoxygenase and minor non-lipoxygenase-generated compounds were shown to have discriminating ability with respect to both factors. Multivariate statistical analysis extracted twenty-one volatile markers with the highest discriminant power for varietal differentiation. The approach reported may have practical application in better understanding, defining, managing, and communicating the varietal or geographical typicity of monovarietal VOOs.

AB Choline is an essential nutrient for the growth and development of the baby, and therefore it is often added to infant formula. In this paper, a novel sensor for choline determination in infant formula is developed based on upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) with near infrared luminescence. UCNPs-based detection can avoid the interference of background fluorescence from complex samples, and thus provide high selectivity and sensitivity. It was observed that in the presence of Fe3+, polyacrylic acid coated UCNPs were quenched to 3% of its original intensity. The degree of quenching was among the best for UCNPs. Hydrogen peroxide could oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+, which caused quenching of the upconversion luminescence. A new H2O2 detection method was thus established. In addition, choline could be hydrolyzed to betaine by choline oxidase, and at the same time produced H2O2, which also caused luminescence quenching through Fe2+ oxidation. Therefore, selective choline sensing was achieved.

AB Lactic acid enantiomers, normally found in fermented food, are absorbed into the blood and interact with plasma carrier protein human serum albumin (HSA). Unveiling the effect on the function and structure of HSA during chiral interaction can give a better understanding of the different distribution activities of the two enantiomers. Multi-spectroscopic methods and molecular modelling techniques are used to study the interactions between lactic acid enantiomers and HSA. Time-resolved and steady-state fluorescence spectra manifest that the fluorescence quenching mechanism is mainly static in type, due to complex formation. Binding interactions, deduced by thermodynamic calculation, agree with the docking prediction. Docking results and kinetic constants represent chiral-recognizing discriminations consistently. The bindings of lactic acid enantiomers lead to some microenvironmental and slight conformational changes of HSA as shown by circular dichroism (CD), synchronous and three-dimensional fluorescence spectra. This investigation may yield useful information about the possible toxicity risk of lactic acid enantiomers to human health.

AB Glutathione and glucose with or without chicken fat/oxidized chicken fat were thermally reacted for generation of stewed meat-like aroma, where 42 sulfur-containing odorants were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O). The observed effects or interactions on meat flavor formation due to the fats were similar to previous reports of cysteine-reducing sugar reactions. Carbohydrate module labeling approach demonstrated ten alkyl chain compounds were indeed resulted from the lipid degradation-Maillard reaction interactions, whereas the fats had little effect on formation pathways of compounds only derived from the Maillard reaction. Formation pathways of 26 potent aroma compounds were proposed, particularly, involving two benzene derivatives and seven complex thiophenes. Notably, it was found for the first time just 2-ethylthiophene could result from both an intact skeleton of glucose and the lipid degradation product of 2,4-hexadienal, and the carbohydrate modules methylglyoxal and hydroxyacetone could arise from the glutamic acid of GSH.

AB Rapid and efficient detection of pathogenic bacteria from food is critical to prevent epidemic food poisoning. However, the isolation of pathogenic bacteria from spoiled food is hampered by the lack of proper cell cultivation and/or isolation methods. Most of currently used methods suffer from complex, time-consuming culturing steps, low scalability, and high operation cost. Herein, we developed an alternative approach for the isolation of pathogenic bacteria directly from food using a surface-modified, highly porous sponge via initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) process. A hydrophobic polymer, poly(2,4,6,8-tetravinyl-2,4,6,8-tetramethyl cyclotetrasiloxane) (pV4D4), was deposited conformally on amphiphilic 3-dimensional (3D) melamine sponge to incorporate hydrophobicity as well as oleophilicity to the porous sponge surface, which is appropriate for absorbing oil component selectively from food extracts. Furthermore, the surface-modified sponge was capable of the isolation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7) from heterogeneous mixture with oil/water/food particles with undistinguisible efficiency compare to artificial model system. The surface-modified sponge developed in this study will be a novel platform for oil/water separation and isolation of foodborne pathogens directly from heterogeneous mixture to enhance the efficiency of molecular diagnostics.

AB The aim of the present study was to prepare and characterize bionanocomposite materials, and to evaluate its use in the coating of Ras cheese. The bionanocomposite materials were made from mixture of chitosan/polyvinyl alcohol with loading of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs) from (0.5-2%). The prepared nanoparticles as well as the bionanocomposites were evaluated using, XRD, SEM, TEM, FT-IR and final contact angle. Furthermore, the mechanical properties and water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of the fabricated bionanocomposites were evaluated. The impacts of coating Ras cheese with the prepared bionanocomposite on weight losses and microbiological, chemical, and physical characteristics of the Ras cheese were assessed during ripening in comparison to the uncoated cheese. Coating of cheese decreased the weight and moisture losses but didn't affect the normal ripening changes in the microbiological, chemical and textural properties of Ras cheese. Coating cheese with film containing 2% TiO2-NPs eliminated mold growth on the cheese surface.

AB A 5 mg/mL solution of water, methanol and acetone extracts of seaweeds were used for alpha-glucosidase inhibition assay hyphenated with high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS). The results showed acetone extracts of Undaria pinnatifida has the strongest inhibitory effect against alpha-glucosidase activity with IC50 0.08 +/- 0.002 mg/mL. The active compound found in Undaria pinnatifida was identified as fucoxanthin. Analytical standard sample of fucoxanthin significantly inhibited alpha-glucosidase with IC50 value 0.047 +/- 0.001 mg/mL. An inhibition kinetics study indicates that fucoxanthin is showing mixed-type inhibition. These results suggest that Undaria pinnatifida has a potential to inhibit alpha-glucosidase and may be used as a bioactive food ingredient for glycaemic control.

AB A novel and highly sensitive metastable state nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (MSNERS) was reported in this work, which employed an amphiphilic polymer polyurethane-Ag nanoparticle (AgNPs) as the MSNERS substrate. Polyurethane could form micelle to incorporate nanoparticles and analytes, where targets could be in close contact with the metal surface, which was effective for further enhancing the detection sensitivity. Time-dependent visible absorption spectra and time-dependent Raman spectra indicated that polyurethane could greatly enhance the stability of AgNPs aggregates during the volatilization process, which was a great improvement of MSNERS substrate. Combining this MSNERS substrate with the rapid separation method of thin layer chromatography (TLC), this TLC-MSNERS was successfully applied to analyze mixed pesticides on fruit skin and the detection limits of thiabendazole, triazophos and phosmet were 0.02 mu g/mL, 0.8 mu g/mL, and 0.6 mu g/mL, respectively. It enhanced 1 order of magnitude the signals of analytes in comparison to that of traditional TLC-SERS method.

AB Ethanol extracts (EE) from fenugreek and quinoa seeds with different total content of inhibitory compounds (TIC, total saponin plus phenolic) were prepared with and without concentration of TIC (CEE - concentrated EE-, and EE, respectively). Their inhibitory activity on pancreatic lipase and alpha-amylase was assessed by traditional in vitro methods (with or without orbital shaking), and by simulating intestinal digestion.
   CEE contained higher contents of TIC than EE, being fenugreek superior to quinoa (p < 0.001). The extracts inhibited enzymes in a dose-dependent manner, CEE extracts being stronger (fenugreek for lipase -p = 0.009-, and quinoa for alpha-amylase -p < 0.001-). Shaking did not impact the activity. Intestinal conditions worsened the inhibition of lipase, but slightly catalyzed the alpha-amylase. Longer times of reaction worsened activities.
   The importance of assessing the inhibitory activity of extracts under simulated intestinal conditions is concluded, being fenugreek more interesting than quinoa, especially against pancreatic lipase.

AB A method based on headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled to gas chromatography-triple quadrupole/mass spectrometry detection (GC-TQ/MS) with a prior derivatization step with O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl) hydroxylamine hydrochloride (PFBHA) was developed to quantify carbonyl compounds in different categories of Port wines. Optimal extraction conditions were obtained incubating 2 ml of wine with 2.3 g/l of PFBHA for 10 min and extracted during 20 min at 32 degrees C. The method was validated for 38 carbonyl compounds (alkanals, alkenals, Strecker aldehydes, dialdehydes, ketones and furan aldehydes) with regard to linearity, repeatability, inter and intra-day precision and accuracy, showing that the method is suitable for the determination of carbonyl compounds in wines. Tawny wines with 'indication of age' (10-40 years old) presented the highest levels of some carbonyl compounds, such as propanal, pentanal, hexanal, Strecker aldehydes, diacetyl, methyl glyoxal, 3-pentanone and 2-furfural, whereas Ruby wines were characterized by the highest amounts of some unidentified compounds.

Adding rabbit gastric lipase, lipase inhibitor (orlistat) and tocopherols to cod liver oil, lipolysis and oxidation was also studied. Among the marine oils, the highest aldehyde levels (18 mu M MDA, 3 mu M HHE and 0.2 mu M HNE) were detected after digestion of cod liver oil, while the lowest levels were detected in krill and algae oils. Addition of rabbit gastric lipase significantly increased the release of HNE during the digestion. Orlistat significantly reduced lipolysis and MDA formation. Formation of MDA and HHE was delayed by tocopherols, the tocopherol mix Covi-ox (R) T 70 EU being more effective than pure alpha-tocopherol.

AB A novel simple, sensitive and reliable sensor based on S1 nuclease, FAM-labeled ssDNA (DNA-F) and graphene oxide (GO) was developed for detecting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and evaluating the freshness of meat (beef) samples. With S1 nuclease as the cleaver of DNA-F and ATP as the inhibitor of S1 nuclease, the fluorescence of DNA-F could be obviously quenched by GO, which exhibits the fluorescence of system gradually decrease as the increasing ATP concentration. Under the optimal conditions, a linear correlation between the fluorescence and the ATP concentration from 20 mu M to 3500 mu M is obtained with a detection limit of 3.2 mu M. Furthermore, the proposed ATP detection method was applied to the ATP detection in microorganisms in meat samples, which acquired the satisfying results, respectively.

AB A sensitive and selective fluorimetric method for the rapid determination of trace amounts of As(III)/As(V) species in certain tea samples forms the basis of the study. 3', 6'-bis(diethylamino)-2-{[(1E)-(4,5-dimethyl-2-furyl) methylene] amino} spiro[isoindole-1,9'-xanthen]-3(2H)-one (DMBD), was synthesized and characterized as a new fluorescence reagent for the speciation of As(III)/As(V) species. As(III) was quantitatively recovered with fluorescence reagent at concentrations between 0.5 and 1.5 mol L-1 of HNO3, while As(V) was not quantitatively recovered at any pH. The optimum conditions for the speciation of As(III)/As(V) species were investigated on certain commonly tested experimental parameters such as acidity and pH of the sample, amount of reagent, effects of temperature, and interfering ions etc. In order to determine trace amounts of total arsenic, KI and L(+) ascorbic acid were used to reduce As(V) to the trivalent state in the sample solution prior to determination. The concentration of As(V) in the sample solution were calculated by the difference in concentration between As(III) and the total arsenic in the sample solution. The study yielded a linear function of the concentration of As(III) in the 0-5mg L-1 range with a detection limit of 0.22 mu g L-1. The relative standard deviation was found to be 0.3% for the 0.5 mg L-1 As(III) level. The proposed method was successfully applied for the determination of trace amounts of As(III) and As(V) in certain tea samples. The results of analysis of the certified reference material (INCT-TL-1 tea sample) was found to be in good agreement with the certified value.

AB A rapid multiplex silver enhanced 'sandwich vertical flow immunogold assay (SVIA)' based on disposable porous filter-membrane was developed for on-site detection of oxytetracycline (OTC) residues in fish tissues. Artificial antigens were synthesized to raise selective anti-OTC rabbit antiserum and highly specific monoclonal antibody (mAb). The assay consists of three layers. The first layer was composed of immobilized anti-OTC rabbit antiserum (capture antibody) onto the membrane, the second layer was the molecule of interest (OTC) and the third layer was refined with detector immunogold labeled mAb. The sensitivity of the silver enhanced SVIA was as low as 2 ng mL(-1) (within 4 min) representing a 125-fold increase in sensitivity over the HRP labeled sandwich vertical flow assay. The reliability of developed technique was co-evaluated with HPLC and validated using 115 field fish samples from different regions of southern India. The results demonstrated that SVIA has the high potentiality to be established as a semi-quantitative routine on-site screening tool.

AB In this work, we implement interfacial forces (surface tension, hydrostatic and viscous forces) by enlisting the finite volume discretization of GFM (Ghost Fluid Method) using A-CLSVOF (Algebraic Coupled Level-Set/Volume-of-Fluid) method for the mass conservative, and smooth interface description. The widely used PISO momentum solution to resolve the pressure-velocity coupling is presented along with the present GFM discretization and its placement within the PISO loop. The pressure jump at the interface due to the interfacial forces is made sharp via direct calculation of the modified pressure matrix coefficients corresponding to targeted interfacial cells, and as a source term for the jump value itself. The Level-Set field is enlisted for curvature computation in A-CLSVOF and for the interpolation and weighting of the relative contribution of the capillary force in adjacent for the matrix coefficients in the FV framework. To assess the A-CLSVOF/GFM performance, four canonical cases were studied. In the case of a static droplet in suspension, A-CLSVOF/GFM produces a sharp and accurate pressure jump compared to the traditional CSF implementation of A-CLSVOF. The interaction of viscous and capillary forces is proven to be accurate and consistent with theoretical results for the classical capillary wave. For the linear two-layer shear flow, GFM sharp treatment of the viscosity captured the velocity gradient across the interface and removed the diffusion of the viscous stresses caused by the discontinuous material properties. Finally, the combination of all GFM improvements proposed in this study are compared to experimental findings of terminal velocity for a gaseous bubble rising in a viscous fluid. GFM outperforms CSF with errors of 4.6% and 14.0% respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The numerical simulation of two-fluid flows with sharp interfaces is a challenging field, not only because of their complicated physical mechanisms, but also because of increased computational cost. An efficient and robust numerical formulation for incompressible two-fluid flows is proposed. Its novelty is the consistent coupling of Fast Direct Solvers (FDS) with the Immersed Boundary (IB) method to represent solid boundaries. Such a coupling offers several advantages. First, it extends the range of applicability of the IB method. Second, it allows the simulation of practical problems in geometrically complicated domains at a significantly reduced cost. Third, it can shed light on regions of the parametric space which are considered out of reach, or even impossible today.
   Instead of using a conventional variable coefficient pressure Poisson equation, a pressure-correction scheme is suggested for the solution of a constant coefficient Poisson equation for the pressure difference, extending the novel work of Dodd and Ferrante [8]. The conservative Level-set (LS) method is used to track the interface between the two fluids. Appropriate schemes, based on the local directional Ghost Cell Approach (GCA) are proposed, in order to satisfy the boundary conditions (BCs) of the pressure and the LS function around the IB.
   The accuracy, robustness, and performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by several validations against conventional approaches and experiments. The results verify that the pressure BCs are properly recovered along the IB solid interface, while a non-smooth pressure field is also allowed across the solid obstacle. The accuracy of the method was found to be 2nd-order, both in time and space. The performance of the proposed method is compared against the conventional approach using a multigrid iterative solver. The impact of the time-step on the accuracy of the constant coefficient approach is examined. Results show that the final speed-up strongly depends on the specific physical and numerical parameters such as the density ratio or the Reynolds number. It is demonstrated that for the range of parameters examined, speed-up factors of 100-10 can be achieved for density ratios of 10-1000 respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Since its origins, lattice-Boltzmann methods have been restricted to rectangular coordinates, a fact which jeopardizes the applications to problems with cylindrical or spherical symmetries and complicates the implementations with complex geometries. However, M. Mendoza [1] recently proposed in his doctoral thesis a general procedure (based on Christoffel symbols) to construct lattice-Boltzmann models on curvilinear coordinates, which has shown very good results for hydrodynamics on cylindrical and spherical coordinates. In this work, we construct a lattice-Boltzmann model for the propagation of scalar waves in curvilinear coordinates, and we use it to determine the vibrational modes inside cylinders, trumpets and tori. The model correctly reproduces the theoretical expectations for the vibrational modes, and exemplifies the wide range of future applications of lattice-Boltzmann models on general curvilinear coordinates.

AB This paper presents a generalised perturbation form of the nonhydrostatic partial differential equations (PDEs) that govern dynamics of all-scale global atmospheric flows. There can be many alternative perturbation forms for any given system of the governing PDEs, depending on the assumed ambient state about which perturbations are taken and on subject preferences in the numerical model design. All such forms are mathematically equivalent, yet they have different implications for the design and accuracy of effective semi-implicit numerical integrators of the governing PDEs. Practical and relevant arguments are presented in favour of perturbation forms that maximise the degree of implicitness of the associated integrators. Two optional forms are implemented in the high-performance finite-volume module (IFS-FVM) for simulating global all-scale atmospheric flows Smolar-kiewicz et al. (2016) [32]. Their relative performance is verified with a class of ambient states of reduced complexity. A series of numerical simulations of the planetary baroclinic instability assumes geostrophically balanced zonally uniform ambient flows with significant meridional and vertical shear and exemplifies accuracy gains enabled by the generalised perturbation approach. The newly developed semi-implicit integrators show the potential for numerically accurate separation of a background state from finite-amplitude perturbations of the global atmosphere and provide a base for further development.

AB The direct-forcing immersed boundary is widely adopted to study particle-laden flows. The effective hydrodynamic diameter of the particle is much or less overestimated by the original immersed boundary method, depending on the particle Reynolds number and grid resolution. In this paper, we propose an improved method to dynamically correct the effective hydrodynamic diameter by retracting inward the Lagrangian points to varying distances. The retraction distance is determined by querying a function fitted in this paper. The improved method is tested and validated by several cases, including falling of a spherical particle under gravity, the uniform flow past two stationary particles and the drafting-kissing-tumbling phenomenon of two settling particles. It turns out the improved method not only provides better results for the drag force but also predicts the flow field more accurately. What's more, due to the insensitivity to grid resolution, the improved method is suitable for simulating large-scale fluid-particle systems such as fluidized bed, which are computationally expensive.

AB We present a finite-element time-domain (FETD) Maxwell solver for the analysis of body-of-revolution (BOR) geometries based on discrete exterior calculus (DEC) of differential forms and transformation optics (TO) concepts. We explore TO principles to map the original 3-D BOR problem to a 2-D one in the meridian rho z-plane based on a Cartesian coordinate system where the cylindrical metric is fully embedded into the constitutive properties of an effective inhomogeneous and anisotropic medium that fills the domain. The proposed solver uses a (TE phi, TM phi) field decomposition and an appropriate set of DEC-based basis functions on an irregular grid discretizing the meridian plane. A symplectic time discretization based on a leap-frog scheme is applied to obtain the full-discrete marching-on-time algorithm. We validate the algorithm by comparing the numerical results against analytical solutions for resonant fields in cylindrical cavities and against pseudo-analytical solutions for fields radiated by cylindrically symmetric antennas in layered media. We also illustrate the application of the algorithm for a particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of beam-wave interactions inside a high-power backward-wave oscillator. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this work, we describe extensions of a hybrid method for time-dependent linear, kinetic radiation transport problems to high-order time integration schemes of the diagonally-implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) and space-time discontinuous Galerkin (STDG) types. The hybrid methods are constructed by splitting the radiation flux into collided and uncollided components to which low- and high-resolution discrete ordinates approximations are applied. The efficiency of hybrid methods constructed using DIRK, STDG, integral deferred correction (IDC), and implicit Euler schemes is compared using a test problem in one-dimensional slab geometry containing material discontinuities. It is observed that (i) higher-order methods are more efficient than the implicit Euler method, often by an order of magnitude or more; (ii) third-order methods yield solutions of a given error in roughly half the time of the second-order method of the same type; and (iii) for a given order of accuracy it is found that the most efficient class of time integration scheme is STDG, followed by DIRK, with IDC the least efficient, for the test problem considered. Two test problems in two-dimensional xy-geometry are used to compare the computational efficiency of hybrid and standard discrete ordinates methods constructed with DIRK and STDG integrators. We observe that replacing a standard discrete ordinates method using an angular quadrature of order N with a hybrid discrete ordinates method using angular quadratures of order 2N and N/2 for the uncollided and collided fluxes, respectively, usually reduces overall solution time by a factor of 2 or more while simultaneously reducing the resulting solution error by a factor of 2 or more for the test problems considered.

AB A numerical code has been developed for the simulation of unsteady incompressible interfacial flows with large density ratios, based on discretizing the conservation equations on a rectangular adaptive grid with a graded octree data structure, in which the pressure and velocity components are stored at the cell vertices and edges, respectively. With this arrangement, which is novel for octree grids, node alignment simplifies the Poisson equation discretization at nodes common to cells with different refinement levels (irregular nodes), while the staggered storage of variables avoids the pressure-velocity coupling difficulties associated with collocated grids. Three different discretization approaches at irregular nodes are proposed: second- and first-order schemes, and an efficient scheme based on a linear interpolation from the surrounding nodes. A grid refinement test in two dimensions, and 3D deformation and static bubble tests were carried out to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed discretization methods at irregular nodes, the performance of the different schemes used to solve the level set transport equation and the capability of the numerical code to reduce spurious currents. The results of the tests are discussed and compared with results available in the literature. Finally, the ability of the code to accurately simulate the complex phenomena involved in the impact of a water drop on a free surface is demonstrated by thoroughly comparing numerical and experimental results.

AB Schrodinger equations with time-dependent potentials are of central importance in quantum physics and theoretical chemistry, where they aid in the simulation and design of systems and processes at atomic and molecular scales. Numerical approximation of these equations is particularly difficult in the semiclassical regime because of the highly oscillatory nature of solution. Highly oscillatory potentials such as lasers compound these difficulties even further. Altogether, these effects render a large number of standard numerical methods less effective in this setting. In this paper we will develop a class of exponential splitting schemes that allow us to use large time steps in our schemes even in the presence of highly oscillatory potentials and solutions. These are derived by combining the advantages of integral-preserving simplified-commutator Magnus expansions with those of symmetric Zassenhaus splittings. The efficacy of these methods is demonstrated through 1D, 2D and 3D numerical examples. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a method that dynamically and efficiently performs connectivity calculations between many (O(10(5))) moving, unstructured overset meshes in parallel. In order to connect overset meshes, elements exterior to the solution domain must be removed from the simulation. In regions with many overlapping meshes, elements must be selectively removed to reduce redundancy while maintaining a solution over the entire domain. Around masked regions interpolation partner pairing is required between meshes to provide boundary conditions. For general unstructured meshes, these steps involve challenging computational geometry calculations which must be efficient and automatic. For many moving meshes each step must be massively parallelized and scalable to large numbers of computational cores. To establish communication patterns a parallelized master/slave algorithm is used which minimizes global communication and storage. To remove elements a parallel 'Forest Fire' flood-fill algorithm is used to set a masking variable. For interpolation partner pairing, and other necessary searches, k-dimensional tree data structures (k-d trees) are extensively used. Often in a calculation, the connectivity between overset meshes remains largely the same between time steps. The temporal coherence of the various objects in the connectivity calculation is directly used to only update necessary information with time, resulting in substantial cost savings. Details of the different algorithms are presented. Resulting connectivity and timings are shown for complex geometries. Parallel scaling is demonstrated for 100,000 spherical particles within a channel up to 492,000 processors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The quasi-neutral hybrid model with kinetic ions and fluid electrons is a promising approach for bridging the inherent multi-scale nature of many problems in space and laboratory plasmas. Here, a novel, implicit, particle-in-cell based scheme for the hybrid model is derived for fully 3D electromagnetic problems with multiple ion species, which features global mass, momentum and energy conservation. The scheme includes sub-cycling and orbit-averaging for the ions, with cell-centered finite differences and implicit midpoint time advance. To reduce discrete particle noise, the scheme allows arbitrary-order shape functions for the particle-mesh interpolations and the application of conservative binomial smoothing. The algorithm is verified for a number of test problems to demonstrate the correctness of the implementation, the unique conservation properties, and the favorable stability properties of the new scheme. In particular, there is no indication of unstable growth of the finite-grid instability for a population of cold ions drifting through a uniform spatial mesh, in a set-up where several commonly used non-conservative schemes are highly unstable.

AB The paper proposes a novel computational method for simulating diffraction of obliquely incident plane waves by a doubly periodic array of arbitrarily shaped planar delaminations in elastic layered structures. The presented approach is an extension of the boundary integral equation method (BIEM) based on the boundary integral approach. Periodically situated delaminations are simulated via spring boundary conditions (SBCs), which allows considering bridged cracks. A boundary integral equation is formulated for a reference delamination based on SBCs in terms of the Fourier transform of Green's matrix and solved using Galerkin method. Two modifications of the method are proposed: the spectral BIEM applied only for rectangular delaminations and the meshless BIEM with axisymmetric basis functions, which is applied for delaminations of arbitrary shapes. The effectiveness of regular and irregular meshes is studied for the meshless BIEM. Comparison of both modifications of the BIEM is provided for open and bridged cracks. The proposed method allows considering specific wave phenomena such as a band-gap formation or opening of an interface for wave propagation in elastic layered structures with a doubly periodic array of inhomogeneities (e.g. phononic crystals and damaged interfaces).

AB The Fracture Cut (FraC) approach to mesh three-dimensional (3D) Discrete Fracture Networks (DFN) is presented. The considered DFNs consist of a network of planar two-dimensional (2D) fractures sharing intersections that can in turn intersect themselves, resulting in highly complex meshing issues. The key idea of FraC is to decompose each fracture into a set of connected closed contours, with the original intersection traces located at the boundaries of the contours. Thus, intersection segments can be more easily accounted for when building a conforming mesh. Three distinct strategies for intersection points management are also proposed to enhance the quality of resulting meshes. Steady-state single-phase flow simulations are performed to validate the conform meshes obtained using FraC. The results from flow simulations as well as from a mesh quality analysis on a benchmark case show that a flexible AoM strategy (Adding or Moving intersection points) appears to be the best choice to generate ready-to-run meshes for complex DFN. This approach also allows accounting for tiny features within the fracture networks while keeping a good mesh quality and respecting DFN connectivity. Finally, a scalability of the mesh generator is conducted to assess the performance of the approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this work we propose a novel Hybrid High-Order method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations based on a formulation of the convective term including Temam's device for stability. The proposed method has several advantageous features: it supports arbitrary approximation orders on general meshes including polyhedral elements and non-matching interfaces; it is inf-sup stable; it is locally conservative; it supports both the weak and strong enforcement of velocity boundary conditions; it is amenable to efficient computer implementations where a large subset of the unknowns is eliminated by solving local problems inside each element. Particular care is devoted to the design of the convective trilinear form, which mimicks at the discrete level the non-dissipation property of the continuous one. The possibility to add a convective stabilisation term is also contemplated, and a formulation covering various classical options is discussed. The proposed method is theoretically analysed, and an energy error estimate in h(k+1) (with h denoting the meshsize) is proved under the usual data smallness assumption. A thorough numerical validation on two and three-dimensional test cases is provided both to confirm the theoretical convergence rates and to assess the method in more physical configurations (including, in particular, the well-known two- and three-dimensional lid-driven cavity problems).

AB In this article, a new high order interface tracking method is developed that combines Face Offsetting Method (FOM) with Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) scheme. Since FOM is Lagrangian-based method, it requires less computation time and results in smaller volume loss compared with methods based on the Eulerian approach. However, it is a first order method even in smooth regions because it uses only neighboring face normals to determine offsetting directions. Moreover, the method is greatly influenced by parameters that determine the local shape at each node, which in turn determines the correct propagating direction. We introduce a high order FOM which not only tracks the surface with higher accuracy than the conventional method but also depends less on the parameters and accurately determines the local shapes of the surface. Various numerical results are presented for verifying these advantages. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Exciton diffusion length plays a vital role in the function of opto-electronic devices. In many experiments, photoluminescence in a regular domain is measured as the observation data to estimate this length parameter in an inverse manner. However, the domain occupied by the organic semiconductor is often subject to surface measurement error. The result is sometimes sensitive to the surface geometry of the domain and the estimations based on 1D or 2D models are found to be inconsistent due to the uncertainty in the domain boundary. In this paper, we employ a random function representation to address this uncertainty. Our forward model is a diffusion-type equation over the domain whose geometric boundary is subject to small random perturbations. We propose an asymptotic-based method as an approximate forward solver which only needs to solve several deterministic problems over a fixed domain. For the same accuracy requirements we tested here, the running time of our approach is more than one order of magnitude smaller than that of directly solving the original stochastic problem by the stochastic collocation method. From numerical results, we find that the correlation length of randomness is important to determine whether a 1D reduced model is a good surrogate for the 2D model. This discovery suggests that for some materials where both small molecules and polymers can form crystal structures, exciton diffusion can be well described by the 1D model, but for other organic materials with low crystalline order, the reduced 1D model is not sufficiently accurate for diffusion length estimation.

ID SWEEPING PRECONDITIONER; HELMHOLTZ-EQUATION
AB This paper presents the sparsifying preconditioner for the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations in the integral formulation. Following the work on sparsifying preconditioner for the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, this paper generalizes that approach from the scalar wave case to the vector case. The key idea is to construct a sparse approximation to the dense system by minimizing the non-local interactions in the integral equation, which allows for applying sparse linear solvers to reduce the computational cost. When combined with the standard GMRES solver, the number of preconditioned iterations remains small and essentially independent of the frequency. This suggests that, when the sparsifying preconditioner is adopted, solving the dense integral system can be done as efficiently as solving the sparse system from PDE discretization.

AB The mass flow rate of Poiseuille flow of rarefied gas through long ducts of two-dimensional cross-sections with arbitrary shape is critical in the pore-network modeling of gas transport in porous media. Here, for the first time, the high-order hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method is used to find the steady-state solution of the linearized Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook equation on two-dimensional triangular meshes. The velocity distribution function and its traces are approximated in piecewise polynomial spaces (of degree up to 4) on the triangular meshes and mesh skeletons, respectively. By employing a numerical flux that is derived from the first-order upwind scheme and imposing its continuity weakly on the mesh skeletons, global systems for unknown traces are obtained with fewer coupled degrees of freedom when compared to the original discontinuous Galerkin formulation. To achieve fast convergence to the steady-state solution, a diffusion-like equation for flow velocity, which is asymptotic-preserving into the fluid dynamic limit, is solved by the HDG simultaneously on the same meshes. The proposed HDG-synthetic iterative scheme is proved to be accurate and efficient. Specifically, for flows in the near-continuum regime, numerical simulations have shown that, to achieve the same level of accuracy, our scheme could be faster than the conventional iterative scheme by two orders of magnitude, also it is faster than the synthetic iterative scheme based on the finite difference discretization in the spatial space by one order of magnitude. In addition, the implicit HDG method is more efficient than an explicit discontinuous Galerkin gas kinetic solver, as well as the implicit discontinuous Galerkin scheme when the degree of approximating polynomial is larger than 2. The HDG-synthetic iterative scheme is ready to be extended to simulate rarefied gas mixtures and the Boltzmann collision operator. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper, a two-dimensional immersed boundary method is developed to simulate the dynamics of Newtonian vesicle in viscoelastic Oldroyd-B fluid under shear flow. The viscoelasticity effect of extra stress is well incorporated into the immersed boundary formulation using the indicator function. Our numerical methodology is first validated in comparison with theoretical results in purely Newtonian fluid, and then a series of numerical experiments is conducted to study the effects of different dimensionless parameters on the vesicle motions. Although the tank-treading (TT) motion of Newtonian vesicle in Oldroyd-B fluid under shear flow can be observed just like in Newtonian fluid, it is surprising to find that the stationary inclination angle can be negative without the transition to tumbling (TB) motion. Moreover, the inertia effect plays a significant role that is able to turn the vesicle back to positive inclination angle through TT-TB-TT transition as the Reynolds number increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first numerical work for the detailed investigations of Newtonian vesicle dynamics suspended in viscoelastic Oldroyd-B fluid. We believe that our numerical results can be used to motivate further studies in theory and experiments for such coupling vesicle problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB All natural and a growing number of manufactured solid particles are non-spherical. Interesting fluid-particle dynamics applications include the transport of granular material, piling of seeds or grains, inhalation of toxic aerosols, use of nanofluids for enhanced cooling or improved lubrication, and optimal drug-targeting of tumors. A popular approach for computer simulations of such scenarios is the multi-sphere (MS) method, where any non-spherical particle is represented by an assemblage of spheres. However, the MS approach may lead to multiple sphere-to-sphere contact points during collision, and subsequently to erroneous particle transport and deposition. In cases where non-spherical particles can be approximated as ellipsoids with arbitrary aspect ratios, a new theory for particle transport, collision and wall interaction is presented which is more accurate computationally and more efficient than the MS method. In general, with the new ellipsoidal particle interaction (EPI) model, contact points and planes of ellipsoids, rather than spheres, are obtained based on a geometric potential algorithm. Then, interaction forces and torques of the colliding particles are determined via inscribed 'pseudo-spheres', employing the soft-particle approach. The off-center forces and moments are then transferred to the mass center of the ellipsoids to solve the appropriate translatory and angular equations of motion. Considering ellipses to illustrate the workings and predictive power of the new collision model, turbulent fluid-particle flow with the EPI model in a 2-D channel is simulated and compared with 3-D numerical benchmark results which relied on the MS method. The 2-D concentrations of micron particles with different aspect ratios matched closely with the 3-D cases. However, interesting differences occurred when comparing the particle-velocity profiles for which the 2-D EPI model generated somewhat larger particle velocities due to out-of-plane collisions, slightly higher particle-wall interactions, and two-way coupling effects.

AB Biological swimmers often exhibit rich physics due to the hydrodynamic coupling between the fluid flow and the immersed deforming body. Complexity and nonlinearity of their behaviors have imposed significant challenges in design and analysis of robots that mimick biological swimming motions. Inspired by the recent experimental studies of soft robotic swimmers, we develop a fictitious domain/active strain method to numerically study the swimming motion of thin, light-weight robots composed of smart materials that can actively undergo reversible large deformations (e.g., liquid crystal elastomer). We assume the elastic material to be neo-Hookean, and behave like an artificial "muscle" which, when stimulated, generates a principal stretch of contraction. We adopt an active strain approach to impose contractive strains to drive elastic deformation following a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor. The hydrodynamic coupling between the fluid and the solid is then resolved by using the fictitious domain method where the induced flow field is virtually extended into the solid domain. Pseudo body forces are employed to enforce the interior fictitious fluid motion to be the same as the solid structure dynamics. Using the fictitious domain/active strain method, we perform a series of numerical explorations for soft robotic swimmers with both 2D and 3D geometries. We demonstrate that these robot prototypes can effectively perform undulatory swimming and jet-propulsion when active strains are appropriately distributed on the elastica. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB We present a deep learning model, DE-LSTM, for the simulation of a stochastic process with an underlying nonlinear dynamics. The deep learning model aims to approximate the probability density function of a stochastic process via numerical discretization and the underlying nonlinear dynamics is modeled by the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. It is shown that, when the numerical discretization is used, the function estimation problem can be solved by a multi-label classification problem. A penalized maximum log likelihood method is proposed to impose a smoothness condition in the prediction of the probability distribution. We show that the time evolution of the probability distribution can be computed by a high-dimensional integration of the transition probability of the LSTM internal states. A Monte Carlo algorithm to approximate the high-dimensional integration is outlined. The behavior of DE-LSTM is thoroughly investigated by using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and noisy observations of nonlinear dynamical systems; Mackey-Glass time series and forced Van der Pol oscillator. It is shown that DE-LSTM makes a good prediction of the probability distribution without assuming any distributional properties of the stochastic process. For a multiple-step forecast of the Mackey-Glass time series, the prediction uncertainty, denoted by the 95% confidence interval, first grows, then dynamically adjusts following the evolution of the system, while in the simulation of the forced Van der Pol oscillator, the prediction uncertainty does not grow in time even for a 3,000-step forecast.

AB Flexible asymmetric supercapacitor (FAS), as a promising candidate for wearable or flexible electronic devices, draws great attention since it exhibits the flexibility and enhanced areal/volumetric capacitances comparing with the symmetrical Faraday capacitors. Herein, we grow unique ZnCo2O4 nanorods arrays on carbon cloth (ZnCo2O4-CF) by a simple hydrothermal method, and the electrode exhibits a remarkable areal (volumetric) capacitance of 5.18 F cm(2) (167.5 F cm(3)) at 5 mA cm(2) and exceptional capacitance retention of 92.8% after 3000 cycles. A FAS was fabricated using ZnCo2O4-CF as the positive and PPy-CC (deposition of Polypyrrole on carbon cloth) as negative electrodes, respectively. Especially, the asymmetric electrodes help the device to exhibit a wide potential window of 1.6 V and a high areal (volumetric) capacitance of 1.8 F cm(2) (148 F cm(3)). As a result, the FAS shows a maximum energy of 2.3 mW h cm(2) (18.9 mW h cm(3)) at a power density of 7.82 mW cm(2) (82.2 mW cm(3)) and a good stability after 5000 cycles at a current density of 5.0 A cm(2). Furthermore, the FAS shows good flexibility and can withstand bending at different angles while keeping electrochemical performance constant. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Al2O3 coatings doped with Sm2+ and Eu2+ ions are synthesized using plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) process. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of formed coatings excited by 260 nm are composed of broad PL bands associated with Eu2+ ions in Al(2)O3 host with a maximum at around 405 nm and sharp bands in red region corresponding to D-5(0) -> F-7(J) (J = 0, 1, 2) transitions of Sm2+ ions. Comparison of the emission PL spectra of Sm2+, Eu2+ and Sm2+/Eu2+ doped Al2O3 shows that the emission PL intensity of Sm2+ ions in Al2O3 host is about one order of magnitude lower than that of Sm2+/Eu2+ doped Al2O3 indicating that Eu2+ is a very efficient sensitizer for Sm2+ PL enhancement. It is also evident that an addition of Sm2+ to Eu2+ doped Al2O3 coatings causes a decrease of the Eu2+ emission, indicating that non-radiative energy transfer takes place from Eu2+ ions to Sm(2+)ions.

DE Z-scheme; Fe2O3/Cu2O; Photo-Fenton
AB To develop solar-light-driven photo-Fenton catalysts with high activities and structure stability, Fe2O3 doped Cu2O heterojunction has been successfully prepared by a simple one-step redox reaction, which demonstrates excellent catalytic performance for degradation of phenol in neutral solution under simulated solar light. The degradation rate constants (k) of Fe2O3/Cu2O in photocatalysis and photo-Fenton catalysis are 2.35 and 2.66 times as many as that of Cu2O, respectively. The Z-scheme system of Fe2O3/Cu2O effectively increased separation efficiency of electron hole pair, resulting in enhanced photo-Fenton catalytic performance. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The MXenes with excellent chemical and physical properties are novel and promising electrode materials for supercapacitors. However, aggregation and restacking of MXene sheets limit material's electrochemical performance. Here, we report a method to prevent MXene sheets from restacking and significantly improved electrochemical capability of Ti3C2Tx MXene by intercalating with N-doped carbon (NC) introduced from ZIF-8. Ti3C2Tx MXene sheets were prepared by etching Ti3AlC2 powder in HF, then ZIF-8/Ti3C2Tx composite was prepared, followed by annealing in H-2/Ar atmosphere. Benefited from higher specific surface area and electron conductivity, the obtained NC-Ti3C2Tx hybrid shows the quick charge/discharge rate up to 3.0 V s(-1), little IR drop at 50.0 A g(-1), higher specific capacitance of 82.8 F g(-1) at 1.0 A g(-1) (about 210% of the origin), and 100% retention in capacitance after 5000 cycles. This new and effective approach efficiently enhanced the electrochemical performance of Ti(3)C(2)T(x )MXenes and improved them as one of auspicious electrode materials in future energy storage devices.

AB 2D ZnO nanosheets-regenerated cellulose (ZNSRC) photocatalytic composite thin films were prepared from ZnCl2 by using a two-step synthesis method at room temperature. The results show that during the formation of ZNSRC composite thin film, ZnCl2 first reacted with NaOH to form Zn-5(OH)(8)Cl-2 center dot H2O which was then converted to ZnO. The 2D ZnO nanosheets are 350-450 nm in transverse size and 80 nm in thickness, dispersed on both the surface and inside of the ZNSRC thin films. The ZNSRC prepared by 13 h of reaction time has a characteristic of nanoporous 2D ZnO nanosheets and exhibits the best photocatalytic activity, as 1.53 x 10(5) mol methyl orange was completely degraded in 50 min by using 1 g catalyst. Thus, we can conclude that the ZNSRC photocatalytic composite thin films can be very useful for degrading organic dye wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Repeated dissolution and deposition of polysulfide during the cycle could lead to a non-conductive polysulfide layer on the cathode electrode, which would cause the decrease of conductivity for the positive electrode and limit the effect of the sulfur-based conductive material. Therefore, we proposed a vapor growth carbon fiber/polypyrrole (VGCF/PPY) dual functional separator, which can increase the conductivity by VGCF and absorb polysulfide by PPY. Finally, the VGCF/PPY functional separator displays an initial discharge specific capacity of 1085 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C. The capacity remains at 768 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles with a capacity decay of 0.146% per cycle, showing excellent cycle stability. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB BaTiO3/LaFeO3 nanocomposite with BaTiO3 and LaFeO3 nanoparticles in the mole ratio of 1:2 was prepared by a citric sol-gel method and used as sensing materials to fabricate nanoparticle-based sensors. TEM, BET and XPS results suggested that the capability of absorbing oxygen species from air played the more important role than the grain size or specific surface area in the determination of gas sensing performance for nanoparticles. BaTiO3/LaFeO3 sensor showed improved gas response towards ethanol with respect to the LaFeO3 sensor at the expense of deteriorated dynamic response. Owing to the higher content of adsorbed oxygen species and ratio of Fe4+/Fe on the surface of the sensing material, better and stable sensing performance to ethanol was achieved by the BaTiO3/LaFeO3 sensor at the prime working temperature of 128 degrees C, with a high gas response (102.7) to 100 ppm ethanol.

Characterization studies by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the prepared product had a monoclinic structure and was composed of thin shell enwrapped hollow nanospheres. Their large band gap energy of 3.67 eV, remarkable blue shifts both in the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectrum and the photoluminescence (PL) emission peak could be well explained by the thin shell caused quantum confinement effects.

AB A new catalyst preparation method involving the sequential ligand exchange of anionic palladium complexes to cationic complexes via the formation of palladium hydroxide intermediates is proposed. The novel method enables the electrostatic adsorption of an anionic palladium complex on the negatively charged carbon surface, and therefore makes it possible to obtain small and highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles. The H2O2 productivity and H-2 selectivity of the ligand-exchanged catalyst were 16 and 3.6 times higher than those of the Pd/C catalyst prepared by using the same anionic palladium precursor. The strikingly different activities mainly attributed to the difference in the nanoparticle size and the oxidation state of Pd, which clearly indicates that the activity of Pd/C catalyst for the direct synthesis of H2O2 can be greatly improved by the sequential ligand exchange method.

AB Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) thin films with highly-branched dendrite structures were synthesized by electroplating through a simple stirring condition. And, the improved performance of glucose oxidation was achieved on the dendrite Cu2O film electrode. For the amperometric glucose detection, a favorable performance with a high sensitivity of 1470.8467 mu A mM(1) cm(2) and a low operating potential of 0.50 V were achieved. Thus, it would be a promising candidate electrode material for the development of non-enzymatic glucose sensors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated terahertz (THz) transmission of square-particle and rod structured TbFeO3 metamaterials. Mie-type resonances were excited in TbFeO3-based metamaterials. And their dependence on shape and orientation angle was studied. Dielectric TbFeO3 ceramic wafers, which were prepared by 3-D direct writing technology and traditional solid-state sintering method, were processed into square-particle and rod structured metamaterials using laser beam machining. With variation of orientation angle, square-particle structured metamaterial showed angle-independence, while rod structured metamaterial showed complicated behaviors: angle-dependence at lower frequencies and angle-independence at higher frequencies. Circular magnetic and electric field distributions surrounding the incident electromagnetic fields endowed resonances insensitivity to orientation angle. And angle-dependence of rod-shaped metamaterial at lower frequencies were caused by the central symmetry breaking. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Lithium metal, own to high capacity, negative potential and good conductivity, has a huge application prospect for next-generation lithium batteries. Nevertheless, its commercialization is largely hindered by volume expansion and Li dendrites. In this work, we employ a low-cost and scalable powder-sintering method to obtain 3D porous Cu-Zn alloy, which can be used as a host material to induce dendrite-free Li deposition. 3D porous Cu-Zn alloy renders high surface areas, uniform spatial structure and even the good lithiophilicity, resulting in low Li deposition interface energy and low lithium deposition barrier. As a result, 3D porous Cu-Zn alloy electrode exhibits a superior Coulombic efficiency of 98.3% for 160 cycles at 1.0 mA/cm(2), whereas the Coulombic efficiency of Cu foil electrode quickly drops to less than 80.0% only after 55 cycles. In addition, 3D porous Cu-Zn alloy electrode still runs stably for 45 cycles at 10.0 mA/cm(2), and even at a high deposition capacity of 5.0 mAh/cm(2). Therefore, powder-sintering derived 3D porous Cu-Zn alloy may provide innovative insights of electrode designs for next-generation metallic lithium anodes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and its composites incorporated boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) (<= 5 wt%) were fabricated and their thermal conductivities (K) as a function of temperature (20-80 degrees C) were measured. The K of the composite filled with 5 wt% BNNS increased 22% at room temperature and 48% at a high-temperature (below melting point) compared with pure LDPE. In order to reveal the enhancement mechanism for the high-temperature K of the composites, the microstructure evolution of the samples with temperature increasing was investigated by in-situ Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). The results show that the structural stability with temperature increasing and the lower interfacial thermal resistance are favorable for high-temperature K of the composites. This work provides a new recognition for the effect of microstructure evolution on high-temperature K of LDPE-based composites. It is hoped that the research will be instructive for enhancing K of LDPE-based composites by low-content doping and making them well-suited for the high-temperature practical applications.

AB In this paper, Cu/Al laminated composite was prepared by a novel approach, corrugated + flat rolling (CFR) method, with low reduction ratio of 20% per pass, and the microstructure and mechanical properties were investigated. The results indicate that the preliminary combination of the composite can be realized by the first CFR pass and the composite with complete combination was obtained after the flattening rolling process. The corrugated bonding interface was formed without intermetallic phase, and the grain refinement (especially at the interface) occurred after the CFR process. Furthermore, the Cu/Al laminated composite with corrugated bonding interface exhibits outstanding tension-shear and tensile properties. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The structural and compositional analysis confirmed the presence of NiSe2 and Ni(OH)(2) in the synthesized NNCs. The NNCs electrodes delivered an ultrahigh specific capacitance (2212 F g(-1)) than pristine NiSe2 (326 F g(-1)) at a current density of 2 mA cm(2) with capacitance retention of 95% after 5000 cycles. The enhanced performance is due to the positive synergetic effect between NiSe2 and Ni(OH)(2), which provides a free diffusion pathway for the fast ion transport and facile ion accessibility to storage sites.

AB The wetting phenomenon of Sn-37Pb alloy solder spreading on Cu substrate under different ultrasonic fields was investigated. Sn-37Pb/Cu wetting systems showed significant precursor film characteristics with the assist of ultrasonic energy. A short-time ultrasonic field evidently enhanced the wettability of Sn-37Pb/Cu compare to a common wetting field which had no introduced ultrasonic. At the temperature of 213 degrees C, spreading area of a Sn-37Pb solder drop in a 20 kHz, 1000 W ultrasonic field reached maximum at 2 s, and showed significant precursor film characteristics. Atomistic dynamic models showed the relevance between wettability and precursor film formation. The observed dynamic results agreed with the experimental results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Flexible fabric Joule heaters reflect a broad prospect due to their wearable substrate, low cost and easily compatibility to garment. In this paper, graphene-based fabric Joule heaters were fabricated with spraying coating method, the as-prepared fabrics possessed bilayer structure corresponding to the inner graphene/polyurethane layer and the outer graphene oxide layer respectively. The morphology and electrothermal performance of the fabric Joule heaters were accomplished by scanning electron microscopy and infrared camera. The outer graphene oxide could dramatically promote the electrothermal efficiency of the fabric Joule heaters with the steady-state temperature (162.6 degrees C) and the maximum heating rate (8.4 degrees C/s) under 10 V applied voltage, which was much higher than the heaters without GO layer with the steady-state temperature 70.1 degrees C and the maximum heating rate 2.61 degrees C/s. Therefore, the existence of GO layer was first demonstrated to observably enhance the electrothermal efficiency of flexible fabric Joule heaters. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There are increasing interests in fabricating Fe2O3 anode materials in recent years owing to their high theoretical capacity and natural abundance. However, Fe2O3 anode materials encounter great challenges in association with their intrinsic poor electronic conductivity and drastic volume variation during cycling. Herein, rod-like Fe2O3 is prepared through a simple thermal decomposition method. When evaluated as anode material for LIBs, the rod-like Fe2O3 exhibits excellent rate capability (similar to 400 mAh g(-1) capacity even at high current density of 7 A g(-1)). Furthermore, high reversible capacity of similar to 500 mAh g(-1) can be retained at 3 A g(-1) after 1000 cycles. This work demonstrates that the thermal decomposition method is facile and efficient for the preparation of high-performance Fe2O3 anode materials for LIBs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Li4Ti3O12/graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) composite was fabricated via a solvothermal method followed by heating treatment at 700 degrees C for 5 h. In this method, g-C3N4 acted as a support to enhance the electronic conductivity of Li4Ti3O12 . When tested as anode materials for lithium ion batteries, the assynthesized Li4Ti3O12/g-C3N4 composite displays a reversible capacity of as high as 150.8 mAh/g with a capacity retention of 86.8% at 0.5 C after 502 cycles. The cycling performance of the composite is enhanced, which could be attributed to the existence of g-C3N4 support. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To solve the problems of insufficient conductivity and volume expansion of SnS2 during cycling when applied as anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), we designed flexible and self-standing SnS2/carbon nanofibers (SnS2/CNFs) film by electrospinning technology and post sulfuration, in which the ultrafine SnS2 nanoparticles (similar to 5 nm) are preganated in the carbon nanofibers. The three-dimensional carbon nanofibers serve as flexible scaffold with high electrical conductivity to buffer the aggregation and pulverization of SnS2 particles. The obtained flexible SnS2/CNFs film can be directly used as anode for SIBs without adding binder and carbon additive, and exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. The SnS2/CNFs delivers a high capacity of 570.8 mAh g(1) at 0.2 A g(1). Even at a high rate of 5 A g,(1) a high capacity of 247.1 mAh g(1) is still achieved. It also maintains 378.9 mAh g(1) after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g(1). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A simple and cost-effective approach has been exploited for the synthesis of large-area urchin-like Au nanospheres (Au-NSs) micro-nano arrays in anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template. By sputtering Au on the surface of highly ordered Fe nanorods arrays, Au nanoparticles (Au-NPs) could self-assembly to form urchin-like micro-nano arrays. The urchin-like micro-nano arrays exhibit strong surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity for detecting rhodamine 6G (R6G) because of its regular arrangement and rough surface. According to the analysis of three-dimensional finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) simulations (Lumerical FDTD Solution, Inc., Canada), the strong SERS activity is mainly due to the high density of hot spots induced by the gaps between the neighboring Au-NSs. The Urchin-like arrays exhibit promising potential as new platforms to realize novel optoelectronic devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nanotechnology has been offered the prospect for the development of novel nanomaterials with countless potential applications in natural sciences and clinical pharmaceutical. This study described the analysis of green synthesized nickel oxide nanoparticles (NPs) using the extract of Terminalia chebula. The Green synthesized NiO NPs were characterized by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy dispersive X-rays Analysis (EDAX) and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis). Green synthesized NiO NPs displayed the toxicity to breast cancerous cells in a dose-dependent way from 0 to 100 mu g/mL showing noticeable cell viability, Reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity and liberating of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). The statistical scrutiny was also done on the experimental outcomes to check the value and precision of the effects, with p-values <0.05 selected as significant. The planned approach deliberates the NiO NPs as a function of phenolic extracts of T. chebula with vast potential for several biological and biomedical applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, we showed that under UV-blocked sunlight irradiation, MoS2 weakens the photocatalytic activity rate of ZnO by 33%. Finally, we discussed the mechanisms behind the enhanced (weakened) photocatalytic activity under sunlight (UV-blocked sunlight) irradiation based on the UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra as well as the potential band diagrams of the ZnO/MoS2 composite.

AB A broadband tunable absorber is studied based on the silicon metasurface at terahertz frequencies. By tuning the conductivity of silicon, absorptance is more than 90% from 0.497 THz to 1.045 THz with central frequency of 0.771 THz when the conductivity is equal to 2500 S/m. Simulated results show that absorptance peak can be modulated from 1% to 100% when the conductivity continuously changes from 0 S/m to 2500 S/m. The central-symmetry structure leads to polarization independence. Our design may be used as optoelectronic modulator, tunable detector, and terahertz switch. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Super broadband NIR (near-infrared) emission and energy transfer of Nd-Bi-Er co-doped transparent silicate glass-ceramics under excitation 808 nm laser diode were investigated. Super broadband NIR emission in Nd-Bi-Er co-doped extending from 1000 to 1600 nm with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 600 nm were observed. This result is due to the overlapping NIR emission band centered at 1275 nm (ES1 -> GS) of Bi-related and NIR emission band centered at 1063 nm (F-4(3/2) -> I-4(11/2)) of Nd3+ as well as NIR emission spectral band centered at 1546 nm (I-13/2 -> I-4(15/2)) of Er3+. At the same time, the energy transfer processes between Bi-related, Nd3+ and Er3+ were also discussed and proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bioactive nanostructured coating has been a key strategy to improve the cell adhesion and osseointegration of metallic implants. This study presents the electrophoretic coatings of hydroxyapatite with tunable nanocrystal morphologies. The hydroxyapatite nanocrystals were prepared with three different elongated dimensions by the hydrothermal method (similar to 80 nm; SHA, similar to 300 nm; MHA, and similar to 900 nm; LHA), which were used in combination with a fugitive biopolymer chitosan for the electrophoretic deposition on titanium. All the HA coatings were densely and homogeneously deposited and had different and unique nanotopologies and corresponding surface areas. The coating parameter significantly altered the cell behaviors including anchorage, spreading and proliferation; the cell adhesion was better on the small- and middle-sized nanocrystals (SHA, MHA > LHA), which was interestingly opposite in cell spreading (LHA > SHA, MHA), and then the cell proliferation was again up-regulated on SHA and MHA. Although more studies are needed to elucidate the biological phenomenon, the sets of results imply the importance of tailored nanocrystal morphology in the initial (adhesion and growth) cellular events.

AB For the first time, defect-free butt welds of titanium alloy/steel were successfully fabricated via friction stir welding. Joints were produced by employing rotation speed varied at 600 and 950 rpm with a constant travel speed of 47.5 mm/min. An increasing of rotation speed leads to thicken the intermetallic compound layer, coarsen the grain size and thus decrease the joint microhardness. Thanks to the solid-state joining process, only a thin FeTi layer was formed at the interface even rotation speed increased to 950 rpm. As a result, all obtained joints fractured at the base steel material. The work carried out clearly shows the good weldability of titanium alloy to steel via friction stir welding.

AB This letter shows the chemical compatibility between LnZ and YSZ after heat treatment at high temperatures. It was found that LnZ would react with YSZ, and a reaction zone with relatively large grains formed after high temperature treatment, which would usually destroy the structural and compositional stability of the composite specimens. The reaction between LnZ and YSZ was caused by the element interdiffusion due to the chemical potential difference, and a higher sintering temperature would lead to a higher reaction rate. The common tangent law was used to analyze the phenomenon, and a solution was proposed to solve the issue. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB K-containing soot oxidation catalysts are promising to reduce or replace noble metal usage in combustion engine emission abatement systems. In this paper, we introduce a facile approach for applying a K-containing glass catalyst onto structured wire mesh monoliths to achieve low temperature soot removal. A polyvinyl butyral (PVB) modified sol-gel process was developed to yield a crack-free thickness that is 6 times that of the conventional sol-gel process. An intermediate SiO2 barrier layer was found to be effective to insure stability of the glass catalyst over extended cycling periods. The catalytically coated wire mesh can lower the soot ignition temperature ((Tig)) to similar to 370 degrees C with O-2, and offers catalytic stability for long term combustion cycling.

AB The present work was demonstrated to develop a solvent-free scrubber like zinc oxide-decorated multiwall carbon nanotubes (ZnO-MWCNTs) to capture H2S at the ambient atmospheric condition in a laboratory scrubber set up. The resultant zinc sulfide-decorated multi-wall carbon nanotubes (ZnS-MWCNTs) is characterized by analytical techniques indicating facile conversion of ZnO to ZnS on the surface of MWCNTs. Surprisingly, synergistic effect of ZnO and MWCNTs indicates high H2S adsorption capacity of ZnO-MWCNTs at ambient temperature. Further, desulfurization performance in a realistic condition was employed using a bench-scale fixed bed reactor and seen that the ZnO-MWCNTs material showed the highest value of H2S removal (98%). Most importantly, regeneration process was developed for necessitates conversion of ZnS to ZnO by chemical method. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Twin boundary (TB) separation is usually observed on the fracture surface of austenitic stainless steels (gamma-SS) under the influence of hydrogen. However, previous studies fell short in determining the hydrogen distribution and diffusion behavior at the TB. Scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM) is used to investigate the hydrogen distribution at TB in thermally hydrogen-precharged gamma-SS. It is found that there are many martensite (alpha') at TBs in the material. TBs with alpha' provide fast paths for hydrogen diffusion and some hydrogen is trapped at these areas, which is proposed to be one of the reasons for the TB separation. In contrast, no clear acceleration of hydrogen diffusion and trapping of hydrogen are found at TBs without alpha'. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we utilize a two-step solvothermal associated with in-situ ultrasonic precipitation method to construct novel AgCl/g-C(3)N(4 )heterostructure nanotube. Thereafter, the structure and morphology of the hybrid was testified by XRD and FE-SEM, indicating that the hybrid was composed of hexagonal phase g-C3N4 and cubic phase AgCl. Furthermore, the AgCl nanoparticles with the average size of 20 nm were completely dispersed on the surface and nozzle of the g-C3N4 nanotube with the average diameter of 100 nm and the average length of 800 nm. Then the decontamination performance of AgCl/g-C3N4 composite was investigated, showing that the AgCl (20%wt)/g-C3N4 composite has higher photocatalytic effect on Rhodamine B (RhB) solution than pure g-C3N4, which has the higher 92% total removal rate of RhB and the larger K value of 0.02827 min (1). The improved photocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the efficient separation and transfer of photo-generated electron-hole at the hybrid interface via a Z-scheme mechanism.

AB beta-SiC nanowires (NWs) have been successfully synthesized in the absence of Ar gas protection by a simple, catalyst-free chemical vapour deposition (CVD) using silicon, trace nanoscale SiO2 particles, and phenolic resin powders as starting materials. The beta-SiC NWs formed by a vapour-solid growth mechanism, with growth along the [1 1 1] direction. They were well-crystallized, with various morphologies (chain-bead, bamboo-shaped, and linear), and had lengths of up to dozens of microns and diameters of 80-650 nm. Moreover, they exhibited excellent blue-green photoluminescence properties due to the presence of stacking faults and amorphous SiO2. This novel CVD technique is green, low cost, and suitable for large scale production of SiC NWs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, Ag-ZnO cored nanotubes were synthesized by a simple chemical vapor deposition method. The morphology and elemental components of the core inside and the nanotube outside of Ag-ZnO cored nanotube were characterized. The X-ray diffraction result showed two series of characteristic peaks, which were connected with hexagonal wurtzite ZnO and face-centered cubic Ag. The growth behaviour of Ag-ZnO cored nanotubes was explained by vapor-liquid-solid mechanism. The optical absorption spectrum showed an absorption peak at 378 nm and the photoluminescence results demonstrated a weak emission peak in the ultraviolet region which was due to the near-band-edge emission as well as three emission peaks in the visible region which were due to the defect level emission.

AB In the present work, the model alloy of AlSi10Mg was prepared by selective laser melting, and further annealed by two kinds of heat treatment regimes, i.e. A1 (300 degrees C/2h+ water quench) and A2 (535 degrees C/1h + water quench + 190 degrees C/10 h+ furnace quench). The samples were investigated by XRD, SEM, EBSD, room temperature tensile and nanoindentation tests, to understand the effect of heat treatments on the phase constituents, microstructure, residual stress and mechanical properties of the laser additive manufactured AlSi10Mg alloy. The experimental results showed that, the heat treatment method of A1 is an effective heat treatment regime for eliminating the residual stress and improving the comprehensive mechanical properties for structural applications.

AB Porous graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was successfully synthesized by a simple bacterial etching method. Compared with bulk g-C3N4, the specific surface area of the porous g-C3N4 increased from 14.48 to 75.22 m(2)/g, and its photocatalytic activity was significantly enhanced by a factor of 2.49 for photocatalytic H-2 evolution. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity is attributed to the enlarged specific surface area, remarkably narrowed band gap (2.28 eV) and fast electron transportation benefit from the porous structure.

ID CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE
AB Ag-added Ge2Sb2Te5 thin films were prepared by a pulsed-DC co-magnetron sputtering process using Ge2Sb2Te5 and Ag targets. The effect of variation in Ag content through variable power on Ag target was studied on the microstructural and thermoelectric properties of as-deposited and fast annealed thin films at 400 degrees C in a vacuum. It is found that Ag addition induces enhancement in conductivity. When the power on Ag target is exceeded to a critical power, Ag8GeTe6 phase formation occurs mixed with Ge2Sb2Te5 cubic structure which limits the thermoelectric performance. Best conditions provide the films having a lowest electrical resistivity as 0.98 x 10(4) Omega cm and the maximum power factor as 5.83 x 10 (3) W m(-1) K (2). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB By using PbS powder as raw materials, high-purity compact and machinable galena bulk was successfully prepared by sintering method under high pressure and temperature for the first time. The hot pressed sintering was performed at 0.9 GPa and 550 degrees C for 1 h. The as-prepared products were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Electron Probe Microanalysis (ERMA), Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES), Carbon and Sulfur Analyzer, and optical microscopy, respectively. XRD results show that the as-prepared samples have a cubic structure and were identified as galena without any impurity. Based on microscopic observations and element analyses, only galena was identified, and it is consistent with the results of XRD analysis. The density of galena bulk was measured and it is equal to the theoretical value. It is machinable and can be processed into fixed shape. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These electrodes also be used as a front electrode on 2D graphene-based devices at very low cost and temperature (< 70 degrees C). Adhesion between the nickel and graphene was controlled by varying the solution temperature between 50 degrees C and 70 degrees C, followed by Ag plating at room temperature. It was observed that contact resistivity improved between plated electrodes and graphene, helpful in improving the F.F of the device from 49% to 60.1%. Efficiency was enhanced from 4.3% to 5.01%.

AB A simple one-step hydrothermal strategy has been developed to fabricate Sr2YF7 hierarchical microspheres employing NH4BF4 as fluoride source. The crystalline phase and morphologies of the products were characterized by XRD, TEM and SEM. The XRD results showed that the as-prepared samples were tetragonal phased Sr2YF7 with high crystallinity. SEM and TEM observation indicated that the as-synthesized hierarchical microspheres with average size of about 2 mu m were assembled by hollow polyhedrons. N-2 adsorption-desorption measurements revealed that the BET specific surface area of the typical Sr2YF7 hierarchical microspheres is up to 111.4 m(2)/g. The size and morphology of the products could be effectively controlled by adjusting the reaction times. Furthermore, the photoluminescence of hierarchical Sr2YF7:Eu3+ microspheres and hollow polyhedrons were measured, the result showed that PL intensity and decay time were sensitive to the morphology of the product.

AB In this study, the authors successfully obtained high strain-rate superplasticity (HSRS) for an AZ91 Mg alloy using rapidly solidified flaky powder metallurgy (RS FP/M). The RS FP/M AZ91 shows an elongation to failure of 465% at a temperature and initial strain rate of 623 K and 10(-2) S-1, respectively. Furthermore, the optimum superplastic strain rate for the maximum elongation was 10(-2) S-1, which is higher than those attained by other methods. The HSRS obtained in this study is attributed to an effective grain refinement (similar to 1 mu m) and high thermal stability. The bimodal grain structure may further contribute to HSRS.

AB Divalent Ni2+ cation-conducting solid electrolytes, (NixHf1-x)(4/(4-2x))Nb(PO4)(3), were successfully developed by introducing Ni2+ cations into a HfNb(PO4)(3) solid exhibiting a three-dimensional NASICON-type structure. Although the HfNb(PO4)(3) solid has been reported to be purely a Hf4+ ion conductor, the conducting species was changed to the divalent Ni2+ cation upon Ni2+ doping, due to the facile migration of lower-valence ions in the rigid crystal lattice. In addition, by selecting the well-ordered NASICON-type structure as the mother crystal, the (NixHf1-x)(4/(4-2x))Nb(PO4)(3) solid electrolytes exhibited lower activation energies and higher Ni2+ cation conductivities than a previously reported NiZr4(PO4)(6) solid with the beta-Fe-2(SO4)(3)-type structure. Among the (NixHf1-x)(4/(4-)Nb-2x)(PO4)(3) solids, (Ni0.06Hf0.94)(4/3.88)Nb(PO4)(3) (x = 0.06) showed the highest Ni2+ ion conductivity, of 2.27 x 10(-4) S.cm(-1) at 600 degrees C, which is ca. 23 times higher than that of the NiZr4(PO4)(6) solid.

The synergistic effect of the up-conversion property of carbon quantum dots and the surface plasmon resonance from Ag effectively improves the full spectrum absorption and photogenerated charge transfer for Ag/CQDs/Bi2O2CO3 in wastewater treatment. 3-Ag/CQDs/Bi2O2CO3 can degrade methylene blue and bisphenol A by up to 93.85% and 54.88%, respectively, within 90 min under visible light. Additionally, 3-Ag/CQDs/Bi2O2CO3 has a photocatalytic activity of 73.75 and 99.25% for MB under UV light and simulated sunlight, respectively. Here, the new-styled three-component Ag/CQDs/Bi2O2CO3 may provide a valuable method to design highly efficient and full spectrum sunlight harvesting photocatalytic materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB To research optical properties of materials for light-emitting-diodes (LEDs) fabrication, CsPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs) were dispersed in five different substrates to investigate their luminescence. The results show that CsPbBr3 QDs embedded in glass matrices have superior stability, however, the QDs could not be evenly distributed in the matrices, which resulted in uneven luminescence of the glass. To solve this problem, epoxy resin was introduced as cladding material, which yielded a product that had good stability and consistency. CsPbBr3 QDs embedded in epoxy resin show great potential for green fluorescent components in LED applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE BaTiO3/BaZrO3 superlattices; Energy storage density; Periodicity effect
AB [BaTiO3](Lambda/2)/[BaZrO3](Lambda/2) superlattices (SLs) were grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique and their dielectric tunability, ferroelectric, and energy storage properties were investigated by varying the modulation periodicity (Lambda). The maximum dielectric tunability was obtained for the weakest periods accompanied by an energy storage density around 5 J/cm(3) and an efficiency of eta = 80% at room temperature. For the intermediate periods, the SLs present normal ferroelectric behavior with high P-r and E-c leading to lower energy storage properties. High and stable energy storage density and efficiency can be reached by applying high electric field for the SLs with weak periods which makes these systems very promising for energy storage capacitors applications.

AB Bulk alloy compositions in Zr-Al-Co-(Nb) system were understood and designed using our clusters- and mixing entropy-related method. Glass formers in Zr-Al-Co system were regarded as a mixture of Zr-Al and Zr-Co binary clusters with specific ratio. Icosahedral atomic clusters Co-Co3Zr9, Co-Co6Zr6, Al-Al4Zr8 and an Archimedean octahedral anti-prism cluster Al-Al 2 Zr 8 were obtained and used. The coefficients of clusters were designed by mixing entropy. Only four compositions were designed. Among those, alloy with highest GFA was achieved at the composition of Zr53.6Al18.6Co27.8 which enjoyed the same glass forming ability (GFA) as the well-known Zr86Al16Co28 under the same condition. A series of compositions minor alloyed by Nb were further designed and analyzed. The results show that the optimum addition content of Nb could further enhance the GFA. Through the perspective of clusters and mixing entropy, it was assayed qualitatively the origin of enhancing GFA by minor-alloying element, which might help build a foundation for quantitative analysis of minor alloying.

AB In this study, hot extruded pure Zn and Zn-0.02Mg-0.02Cu alloy were prepared. Compared with the pure Zn, the tensile yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and hardness of the Zn-based alloy were significantly improved, reaching 216.29 +/- 3.27 MPa, 262.25 +/- 5.02 MPa and 74.40 +/- 1.84 HV, respectively, satisfying the criteria of biodegradable stents. Electrochemical corrosion and immersion test showed that the corrosion rates of the Zn-based alloy were higher than those of pure Zn. In addition, the Zn-based alloy exhibited excellent biocompatibility for the development of zebrafish embryos and in vivo subcutaneous tissue without severe inflammatory response. These results indicate that the novel Zn-based alloy has a huge potential in cardiovascular stents. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB MnO addition had a remarkable effect on the microstructure, mechanical and electrical properties of BaO-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramics. The crystallizing behavior was investigated by the whole pattern fitting method. The sintering kinetics was also studied based on the shrinkage rate curves. The result showed that 1 wt% MnO addition effectively promoted crystallization and densification. It was found that the high crystallinity as well as the large grain size contributed to the strong bending strength and Young's modulus. For the sample doped with 1 wt% MnO, bending strength and Young's modulus increased significantly from 136.3 MPa to 201.2 MPa and 59.7 GPa to 79.7 GPa, respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The synthesis is accomplished by the high temperature solvothermal treatment of bulk BN in aqueous NaOH. The morphology and properties of the formed BNNSs and BNQDs were characterized, and the results suggest that the bulk h-BN can be efficiently exfoliated to BNNSs and BNQDs.

AB Flexible perovskite solar cells are arising researchers' attentions due to their promising potential applications. In this letter, homogeneous and highly crystalline SnO2 nanoparticles are successfully synthesized by a solvothermal method, which are then employed to deposit high quality electron transport layers by spin coating and baking at a temperature as low as 150 degrees C. The prepared SnO2 layer has a homogenous and flat surface without any pinholes. The resulting flexible perovskite solar cell shows a high power conversion efficiency of 13.90%, which is mainly attributed to the good transmittance, efficient electron extraction and hole blocking ability of the SnO2 electron transport layer.

AB WO3 nanoparticle-decorated ZnO nanowires are synthesized by the hydrothermal and vapor-liquid solid (VLS) methods, respectively. WO3 nanoparticles are decorated on the surface of ZnO nanowires to fabricate the highly sensitive hydrogen gas sensor. This structured sensor presents a sensing response that is 4.3 times higher than its counterpart for 2000 ppm hydrogen gas. The variation in depletion layer width of the ZnO nanowires increases as the WO3 nanoparticles are decorated. This improves the sensing response of the WO3 nanoparticle-decorated ZnO nanowire sensor compared with its counterpart. In this research, a synthetic method of WO3 nanoparticle-decorated ZnO nanowires is described, and its physical and chemical properties are analyzed. Moreover, the sensing responses are measured, and the sensing mechanism is discussed in this literature. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Impressive progress has been made on the development of magnesium alloys (Mg) implants in cardiovascular and orthopedic applications due to their good mechanical strength and biodegradable. In this paper, heparin and carboxymethyl chitosan were immobilized on alkali-treated Mg to improve the hemocompatibility and antibacterial activities. Electrochemical tests revealed that the surface modified Mg obviously improved the corrosion resistance. Additionally, the surface-functionalized Mg exhibited excellent antithrombotic and antibacterial activities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Ceramic binder jetting additive manufacturing: Particle coating for
   increasing powder sinterability and part strength
SO MATERIALS LETTERS

AB The objective of this research is to test a hypothesis that particle coating increases the sinterability of ceramic powder. This method is developed for binder jetting additive manufacturing but tested using a pressing and sintering route for the simplicity. Binder jetting additive manufacturing has demonstrated its considerable capability in manufacturing ceramic parts with a complex shape and/or a customized design. Currently, the density of the ceramic parts made by binder jetting is low and their mechanical properties are inferior. The main reason is the low sinterability of the powder feedstock. A new powder surface modification method, i.e., particle coating, was applied to increase the powder sinterability and the part strength. Specifically, coarse crystalline alumina particles (70 and 10 mu m in average) were coated with amorphous alumina, in which the microsized core was designed to provide the high flowability and the amorphous shell to promote sintering due to its high activity. The coated powder was pressed into disk samples and sintered. The samples from the coated powder showed significantly higher shrinkage and compressive strength than those from the raw powder, which proved the feasibility of the particle coating method to increase the powder sinterability and part strength.

AB Herein, novel multiple hollow CeO2 spheres decorated nanosheet-assembled MnO2 microflower as an electrocatalyst towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was successfully synthesized through a two-step hydrothermal approach. It is surprising to find that this composite with unique architecture exhibits a superior ORR catalytic activity than that of flower-like MnO2 and hollow CeO2 spheres monomers. The ORR catalytic activity is also comparable to that of 20 wt% Pt/C. The excellent electrocatalytic performance for ORR attributes to the synergistic effect between the hollow CeO2 spheres and hierarchical nanosheet-assembled MnO2. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB N-doped carbon encapsulated MnO nanoparticles (MnO/NC) is synthesized via a straightforward hydrothermal strategy and a subsequent annealing treatment. When evaluated as an anode for lithium ion batteries, MnO/NC exhibits a high reversible capacity (1158 mA h g (1) over 300 cycles at 0.2 A g (1)), good cyclability, and excellent rate performance. The superior electrochemical performance should be attributed to the synergistic effect of MnO nanoparticles and N-doped carbon capsules. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, Na alginate (an aquatic-derived substance isolated from brown algae) is thermally treated under very mild condition (onset temperature). The effectiveness of the conversion has been determined via physicochemical characterizations, showing the possibility of modifying the (bio)polymeric chemical structure just at the beginning of its thermal degradation, guaranteeing an overall energetic beneficial effect.

The microstructure transformation of the alloy during different processing stages was characterized by XRD and TEM. The magnetic properties of the nanocrystalline powder were measured by VSM. The results showed that the Ce2Fe14B matrix phase of the Ce13Fe81B6 alloy was dispro-portionated into the nanostructured CeH2.51, alpha-Fe, and Fe2B phases by ball milling in hydrogen for 20 h, and that these nanostructured phases could be desorbed and recombined to nanocrystalline Ce2Fe14B phase again by subsequent vacuum annealing, with the remanence, coercivity, and maximum energy product of the as-synthesized alloy powders achieving 8.1 kGs, 6.02 kOe, and 8.51 MGOe, respectively.

AB A novel thin film composite (TFC)-type forward osmosis (FO) membrane was prepared via the anchoring of mesoporous silica hollow spheres (MSHS) in the polyamide active layer. Compared to the unmodified FO membrane, the addition of MSHS significantly increased the separation flux by more than 80% and inhibited the trade-off phenomenon of the prepared FO membrane. It was believed that the addition of MSHS introduced a rapid adsorption-diffusion permeation process, which optimized the slow dissolution-diffusion separation process of the dense active layer and improved the separation efficiency of the TFC-type FO membranes. In addition, the prepared FO membrane exhibited high separation selectivity for heavy metal ions with the rejection ratio over 99.3%, which provided a positive reference for the treatment of heavy metal ion wastewaters by FO membranes.

AB The structure of metallic melt is not homogeneous and liquid-liquid structure transition (LLST) widely exists which can make strong influence on the subsequent solidification process. Here we report an experimental evidence of temperature induced LLST in a Co-B eutectic melt by in-situ measuring the magnetization within a wide temperature range under high magnetic fields. A transition point (T-0) and two paramagnetic Curie temperatures (theta(p)(L1), theta(p)(L2)) corresponding to two different structures of the liquids are determined. The effects of magnetic field intensity on the LLST and paramagnetic curie temperatures are studied, and T-0 and theta(p)(L2) are found not sensitive to the field intensity, whereas, theta(p)(L1) shifts to lower temperatures with the increasing magnetic field intensity.

AB Proton exchange membranes (PEMs) with good proton conductivity and mechanical properties are highly desired for applications in fuel cells. This work immobilized sulfonic acid groups stably into polybenzimidazole (PBI) by a solid phase reaction. The structures of the sulfonated PBI (s-PBI) are characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy. The proton conductivity and mechanical properties of s-PBI are measured. The s-PBI PEMs showed improved proton conductivity as increasing the amount of azides when comparing to the pure PBI PEM. The strength and modulus of s-PBI PEMs are decreased, but still much larger than s-PBI PEMs prepared by acid doping, sulfonation, and blending. Such s-PBI PEMs made by solid phase reaction would be good candidate for fuel cell applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB By using molecular dynamics simulations, we have studied the thermal rectification in double-layered Graphene-carbon nanotube (DGN-DWCNT) junctions. It is found that DGN-DWCNT junctions exhibit significant thermal rectification under both large and small thermal bias. Even under a small thermal bias vertical bar Delta vertical bar = 0.1, a rectification ratio as high as 300.6% can be achieved. The influences of the geometric parameters on the thermal rectification of the DGN-DWCNT junctions are discussed, and the underlying mechanism of the significant thermal rectification is explored. These results open a door in the applicability of DGN-DWCNT junctions and their based pillared graphene system in nanoscale engineering of thermal transport devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB This communication reports a viable low temperature method for scalable production of SnS2 nanomaterials with promising applications in visible-light photocatalysis and photovoltaics. SnS2 nanoflakes were synthesized via heating the mixture of NH4Cl, S and Sn powders in air at 250 degrees C for 2 h, followed by a washing process. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms characterization indicated the formation of pure SnS2 nanoflakes with a specific surface area of 32.081 m(2)/g. Comparative synthesis experiments manifested that NH4Cl played an indispensable role in our low temperature synthesis of SnS2. UV-vis absorbance spectrum demonstrated that the assynthesized SnS2 nanoflakes had much higher absorption of visible-light than hydrothermally synthesized SnS2 and thermally exfoliated g-C3N4. Transient photocurrent measurements and photocatalytic tests indicated that our product had not only exceptionally larger photocurrent, but also significantly higher photocatalytic activity than hydrothermally synthesized SnS2 and thermally exfoliated g-C3N4 in the reduction of Cr(VI) under visible-light (lambda > 420 nm) irradiation.

AB Mesophase pitch-based C/C composite is one of the best candidate materials for high thermal conductivity. In this work, the fine microstructure of its matrix has been analyzed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Interestingly, although the results show that the matrix is composed of hexagonal graphite, the [11-20] and [10-10] zone axes coexist in the same pattern (at variance with traditional diffraction theory). Furthermore, a large number of differently oriented nanostructures interwoven with the main hexagonal graphite have been identified by a series of tilting diffraction patterns, dark-field images, and high-resolution TEM images. The relative positional relationship between these nanostructures and the main graphite has been obtained. This paper provides a theoretical basis for the improvement of thermal conductivity and other properties (such as Li+ and Na+ storage) of mesophase pitch-based C/C composites. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations were performed for Al-Sb system with and without excessive Al. Our results demonstrated the population of low angle bond is apparently increased due to the addition of excessive Al. The necessary bond transition from low angle to high angle in crystallization process was significantly retarded, which might be the origin of enhanced thermal stability of AlSb with excessive Al. The weak Al-Sb bond in the low Al-Sb-Al bond angle accounts for the fast phase change speed of Al-Sb system. Our work clarified the physical origin of the superior properties of Al-Sb system at the atomic scale and provided some new insights toward PCMs design. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID GROWTH; TRANSITION
AB Large-area self-assembled horizontal ferromagnetic ZnO nanowire arrays (NWAs) have been successfully prepared by catalyst-free post-annealing treatment on ZnO thin films. XRD, SEM and TEM analysis show that the ZnO nanowires with a hexagonal wurtzite structure are aligned along the < 1 1 2 0 > glide directions and the density of wires is an order of magnitude higher than those fabricated using catalyst. Magnetization measurements indicate that the arrays are ferromagnetic at room temperature. It is found that the annealing plays a key role not only in producing nanowire arrays by thermal treatment but also in inducing magnetism by generating vacancies by evaporation. With a high wire density and ferromagnetic ordering, the horizontal NWAs fabricated by the simple annealing method may be useful for fabricating electrical and spintronic devices at nanoscale.

AB The use of plant extracts as reducing agents may be preferable to use of chemical reduction reagent (i.e. sodium borohydride) to synthesis of iron-based nanoparticles for using in wastewater treatment. This report describes the successful synthesis of iron-based nanoparticles (NA-Fe-NPs) using extracts of Nephrolepis auriculata. TEM and XRD indicated that the core of NA-Fe-NPs were amorphous and spherical with size ranging from 40 to 70 nm. Meanwhile, FT-IR revealed that the flavonoids, polyphenols, organic acids in extracts were responsible for reducing Fe3+ and coating/stabilizing the iron-nanoparticles. The removal of Cr(VI) wastewater using NA-Fe-NPs suggested that 90.93% of Cr(VI) were removed, demonstrated the feasibility of the materials for environmental remediation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The occurrence of repair system in microorganisms after ultraviolet (UV)-induced damage to them evokes concern regarding the effectiveness of UV disinfection. Most studies focus on the repair of bacteria, but little research has been conducted on the repair of fungi in water. This study aimed to investigate the photoreactivation and dark repair properties of three dominant genera of fungal spores (Trichoderma harzianum, Aspergillus niger, and Penicillium polonicum) isolated from groundwater. UV-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) (including UV/peroxymonosulfate and UV/hydrogen peroxide) were used to control their photoreactivation. The results demonstrated that the three genera of fungal spores inactivated by UV (254 nm) exhibited different levels of photoreactivation under UVA (365 nm) exposure, and the photoreactivation percentage showed that T. harzianum (51.35%) > A. niger (29.07%) > R polonicum (9.01%). The photoreactivation process of fungal spores was well described by the first-order model. T. harzianum had lower photoreactivation percentage but a more rapid initial photo reactivation process than E. coli. Higher UV dosages significantly decreased the photoreactivation percentage of fungal spores. However, dark repair was insignificant following UV disinfection for all the three genera of fungal spores. After treatment by UV-based AOPs, the fungal spores exhibited the same photoreactivation trend as those treated by UV alone. However, both the maximum survival ratios and photoreactivation rate constants were reduced to varying degrees. This study revealed the photoreactivation rule of dominant genera of fungi isolated from groundwater following UV treatment alone and UV-based AOPs, which is effective for controlling fungi in water.

AB Chromium isotope fractionation analysis is a promising approach for the assessment of microbial Cr(VI) reduction in groundwater. Understanding the mechanisms and other parameters that control Cr isotope fractionation factors (between the product Cr(III) and reactant Cr (VI)) in microbial Cr(VI) reduction is critical to this application. To date, such studies are very limited. Here, the influence of critical factors on observed Cr isotope fractionation during Cr(VI) reduction by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 under various conditions was investigated. The Cr(VI) concentration and Cr isotope ratio measurements were conducted on unreacted Cr(VI) remaining in solution to determine Cr isotope fractionation factors. The changes in ambient environmental conditions (e.g., pH, temperature) have limited influence on Cr isotope fractionation factors. However, as a result of Cr(VI) consumption as the experiments proceed, the change in bioavailability of Cr(VI) has a significant impact on Cr isotope fractionation factors. For example, in temperature-controlled experiments, Cr isotope fractionation showed two-stage behavior: during Stage I, the values of epsilon were -2.81 +/- 0.19 parts per thousand and -2.60 +/- 0.14 parts per thousand at 18 degrees C and 34 degrees C, respectively; during Stage II, as Cr(VI) reduction progressed, Cr isotope fractionation was significantly masked, and the e values decreased to -0.98 +/- 0.49 parts per thousand and 1.01 +/- 0.11 parts per thousand at 18 degrees C and 34 degrees C, respectively. Similar two stage isotope fractionation behaviors were observed in pH-controlled experiments (pH = 6.0 and 7.2) and in experiments with and without the addition of a competing electron acceptor (nitrate). Masking of isotope fractionation in Stage II indicated restrictions on the bioavailability of Cr(VI) and mass-transfer limitations. This study provides an explanation for the variation in Cr isotope fractionation factors during microbial Cr(VI) reduction in the environment, furthering the viability of Cr isotope ratio analysis as an approach in understanding Cr biogeochemical cycling.

TI Influence of chemical speciation on photochemical transformation of

AB This study investigated the contribution of direct, indirect, and self-sensitized photolysis to the photochemical fate of three model fluoroquinolones (FQs), i.e., lomefloxacin (LOM), norfioxacin (NOR), and ofloxacin (OR), and demonstrated the influence of chemical speciation on their photodegradation behavior, a topic that has received relatively little attention. Results suggest that these FQs in water transformed mainly via direct photolysis, while hydroxyl radical played a key role in their indirect and self-sensitized photolysis. Chemical speciation of such zwitterionic compounds significantly affected the kinetics of their phototransformation, with the quantum yields of photodegradation decreased in the order of zwitterionic (FQsH) > anionic (FQs(-)) > cationic (FQsFH(2)(+)). The photodegradation pathways of FQs depended on both their structures and chemical speciation. Defluorination for LOM in C-8 and NOR in C-6 was more significant when they were present in zwitterionic form than in the other forms. Cationic FQs underwent direct piperazinyl ring cleavage, and zwitterionic ones underwent piperazinyl ring oxidation, while the degradation pathway of piperazinyl ring for FQs in anionic form was structure dependent. Decarboxylation for zwitterionic FQs occurred more slowly compared to both cationic and anionic ones, and the FQs bearing electron-donating groups in C-8 position degraded more easily in cationic form than the anionic ones, while the opposite was true for the FQs without such a group in C-8 position. Results of Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition tests showed the toxicity of zwitterionic NOR and OR significantly decreased after photodegradation, while the degradation products of LOM exhibited greater toxicity. These findings indicate that chemical speciation of zwitterionic compounds could affect the kinetics and pathways of their photochemical transformation, and thus have important implications on their fate and risk in aquatic environment.

AB A scale-up procedure was assessed in this study to predict the fixed bed adsorption behaviors with aging granular activated carbon (GAC) for various micropollutants (pesticides, pharmaceuticals). Two assumptions of this upscaling methodology (i.e., involving equal adsorption capacities and surface diffusivities between the batch test and the fixed bed) were studied for the first time to investigate the aging effect on the adsorption capacity and kinetics of carbon at full scale. This study was conducted in natural waters (the Seine River) treated by Veolia Eau d'Ile de France in Choisy-Le-Roi, a division of Syndicat des Eaux d'Ile de France, aiming to monitor real industrial conditions. The isotherms showed that the adsorption capacity for most compounds was significantly affected by aging. For the mass transfer coefficients (i.e., as determined by the homogeneous surface diffusion model (HSDM)), different patterns of adsorbate/adsorbent behaviors were observed, suggesting different competition mechanisms. The model predictions (i.e., HSDM) performed with all parameters obtained during the batch tests tended to overestimate the full-scale pilot adsorption performance. This overestimation could be compensated for by applying a scaling factor. Finally, an empirical pseudo-first order function was used to model the impact of the GAC service time on the characteristic adsorption parameters. Thus, our scale-up procedure may enable the prediction of long-term fixed bed adsorption behaviors and increase the model efficiency for practical implementation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A comprehensive compartment model is presented for PFAS retention that incorporates all potential processes relevant for transport in source zones. Miscible-displacement experiments were conducted to investigate separately the impact of adsorption at the air-water and decane-water interfaces on PFAS retention and transport. Two porous media were used, a quartz sand and a soil, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) was used as the model PFAS. The breakthrough curves for transport under water-unsaturated conditions were shifted noticeably rightward (delayed arrival) compared to the breakthrough curves for saturated conditions, indicating greater retardation due to adsorption at the air water or decane-water interface. The retardation factor was 7 for PFOS transport in the sand for the air water system, compared to 1.8 for saturated conditions. PFOS retardation factors for transport in the soil were 7.3 and 3.6 for unsaturated (air-water) vs saturated conditions. Air-water interfacial adsorption is a significant source of retention for PFOS in these two systems, contributing more than 80% of total retention for the sand and 32% for the soil. For the experiments conducted with decane residual emplaced within the sand, adsorption at the decane-water interface contributed more than 70% to total retention for PFOS transport. Methods to determine or estimate key distribution variables are presented for parameterization of the model. Predicted retardation factors were similar to the measured values, indicating that the conceptual model provided adequate representation of the relevant retention processes and that the parameter estimation methods produced reasonable values. The results of this work indicate that adsorption by fluid-fluid interfaces in variably saturated porous media can be a significant retention process for PFAS that should be considered when characterizing their transport and fate behavior in source zones.

AB To scale up microbial fuel cells (MFCs), larger cathodes need to be developed that can use air directly, rather than dissolved oxygen, and have good electrochemical performance. A new type of cathode design was examined here that uses a "window-pane" approach with fifteen smaller cathodes welded to a single conductive metal sheet to maintain good electrical conductivity across the cathode with an increase in total area. Abiotic electrochemical tests were conducted to evaluate the impact of the cathode size (exposed areas of 7 cm(2), 33 cm(2), and 6200 cm(2)) on performance for all cathodes having the same active catalyst material. Increasing the size of the exposed area of the electrodes to the electrolyte from 7 cm(2) to 33 cm(2) (a single cathode panel) decreased the cathode potential by 5%, and a further increase in size to 6200 cm(2) using the multi-panel cathode reduced the electrode potential by 55% (at 0.6 A m(-2)), in a 50 mM phosphate buffer solution (PBS). In 85 L MFC tests with the largest cathode using wastewater as a fuel, the maximum power density based on polarization data was 0.083 +/- 0.006 W m(-2) using 22 brush anodes to fully cover the cathode, and 0.061 +/- 0.003 W m(-2) with 8 brush anodes (40% of cathode projected area) compared to 0.304 +/- 0.009 W m(-2) obtained in the 28 mL MFC. Recovering power from large MFCs will therefore be challenging, but several approaches identified in this study can be pursued to maintain performance when increasing the size of the electrodes.

AB Cell lysis in sludge pretreatment by advanced oxidation process (AOP) has a great effect on sludge dewaterability. Cell lysis caused by reactive radicals (e.g. hydroxyl radical) was dependent on the reaction site of AOP. However, little is known about the accurate radical generation site of AOP in sludge pretreatment. In this study, two kinds of oxidation behaviors from different oxidants (HOCl vs. H2O2) catalyzed by ferrous iron were comparatively investigated. Higher amount of living cells (84.3%) and hydroxyl radicals (9.86 x 10(-5) M), and more fragmentized sludge flocs (particle sizes of D50 was 50.1 vs. 573 mu m of RS) were detected in sludge conditioned by Fe2+/H2O2 which implied that Fenton reaction mainly happened at surface and outside of sludge flocs (such as EPS layer and liquid phase). Thus, it could be regarded as "extracellular oxidation". Fewer living cells (undetectable), fewer amount of hydroxyl radicals (undetectable in sludge), and more integrated sludge flocs (particle size of D50 was 56.1 vs. 57.3 mu m of RS) were determined in sludge conditioned by Fe2+/Ca(ClO)(2). Hence, it could be regarded as "Intracellular oxidation".
   In addition, sludge pretreatment based on Fe2+/Ca(ClO)(2) could achieve simultaneous deep-dewatering performance and total coliforms inactivation. Based on response surface methodology, the optimal dosages of Fe2+ and Ca(ClO)(2) were proposed as 106.1 and 234.5 mg/g volatile solids respectively, without any acidification of sludge. Under these optimal dosages, the water content of dewatered sludge cake was 51.9 +/- 0.1 wt% and the pH of the final filtrate was 5.8 +/- 0.2. Total coliforms of sludge could be inactivated in 10 s after Fe2+/Ca(ClO)(2) addition. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In situ fluorometers can be used as a real-time cyanobacteria detection tool to maintain safe drinking and recreational water standards. However, previous studies into fluorometers have established issues arising mainly from measurement inaccuracies due to green algae interference. Therefore, this study focusses on developing correction factors from a systematic study on the impact of green algae as an interference source. This study brings a novel technique where the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and phycocyanin measurements are used to correct the fluorometer output for interference bias; four fluorometers were tested against three key cyanobacterial species and the relationship between phycocyanin output, green algae and cyanobacteria concentrations were investigated. Good correlation (R-2 > 0.9, p-value < 0.05) was found between the fluorometer phycocyanin output and increasing green algae concentration. The optimal correction method was selected for each of the fluorometer and cyanobacteria species pairs by validating against data from the investigation of green algae as an interference source. The correction factors determined in this study reduced the measurement error for almost all the fluorometers and species tested by 21%-99% depending on the species and fluorometer, compared to previous published correction factors in which the measurement error was reduced by approximately 11%-81%. Field validation of the correction factors showed reduction in fluorometer measurement error at sites in which cyanobacterial blooms were dominated by a single species. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Source-separated urine is of interest for nutrient recovery. Most nitrogen recovery technologies rely on ammonia (NH3) as input, which requires ureolysis. As urease positive bacteria are widespread, source separated urine is unstable, not only leading to NH3 release but also loss, odor nuisance, and downstream scaling. Hence, ureolysis ideally occurs in a closed controlled environment close to the toilet. We characterized microbial-induced ureolysis, subsequent divalent cation precipitation, and fermentation in anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) at 15 degrees C and 28 degrees C. Temperatures were a proxy for urine hydrolysis in a wet well at street level or in the toilet, respectively. The need for inoculation and the metabolic stability was assessed by inoculation with autofermented urine or a mixture of anaerobic digestion and fermentation sludge. The highest specific ureolysis rates in the SBRs were achieved at 28 degrees C: 2107 +/- 395 and 1948 +/- 1121 mg N g VSS-1 d(-1), for the mixed and autofermented inoculum, respectively. For Ca2+ and Mg2+ precipitation, and organics fermentation, autofermented urine at 28 degrees C performed best with 47.9 +/- 16.4 mg Ca2+ g VSS-1 d(-1), 8.2 +/- 4.6 mg Mg2+ g VSS-1 d(-1), and 623 +/- 129 mg VFA-COD g VSS-1 d(-1), respectively. This indicates the hydrolysis reactor should be close to the toilet. The selected inoculum did not impact ureolysis, whereas both Ca2+ and Mg2+ precipitation and fermentation were better in the SBRs with autofermented urine. Ureolysis was identified as the only process significantly impacting the microbial community, indicating external inoculation would not be required. A urine hydrolysis reactor in the toilet without external inoculation could thus serve as a controlled environment to release NH3 and remove divalent cations to prevent scaling in downstream transport and processing. For practical implementation in a household toilet, the reactor should be designed for user-friendly precipitate discharge and odor control. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the diversity of in situ hydrolyzed aluminum species and discrepancy in the binding sites of humic acid (HA), the mechanisms involved in HA removal were significantly different in inorganic particle removal. Based on the background, the coagulation behavior of in situ and performed hydrolyzed aluminum species for the removal of HA was investigated. For AlCl3, the maximum HA removal reached at weak acidic conditions, where various in situ hydrolyzed Al species containing Al-1 to Al-20 cores with different amounts of water molecules were present. Various Al species could meet the demand for different binding sites and enhance the complexing probability for weak binding sites. Meanwhile, most of the binding sites are occupied by the aluminum ion, which brought about better complexation capacity with the Al species. Therefore, the synergistic effects of various in situ hydrolyzed aluminum species played important roles in the removal of HA. Compared with AlCl3, preformed Al-13 had less efficient in HA removal because the Zeta potential of HA formed by preformed Al-13 with uniform Al species increased from negative to positive with increase in Al-13 dosage. This study provided new insight into the interaction between HA and various hydrolyzed Al species. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol AF (BPAF) were increasingly consumed and these compounds are resistant to environmental degradation. Herein, ferrate oxidation of BPS and BPAF was investigated, and biodegradability of the oxidation products was examined. The second-order reaction rate constants of ferrate with BPS and BPAF were 1.3 x 10(3) M(-1)s(-1) and 3 x 10(2) M(-1)s(-1), respectively, at pH 7.0, 25 degrees C. In the oxidation process, some BPS molecules dimerized, while other BPS molecules were oxidized through oxygen-transfer process, leading to the formation of hydroxylation products and benzene-ring cleavage products. The dominant reaction of BPAF with ferrate was oxygen-transfer process, and BPAF was degraded into lower molecular weight products. The variation of assimilable organic carbon (AOC) suggested that the biodegradability of BPAF and BPS was largely improved after ferrate oxidation. Compared with the BPS oxidation products, the BPAF oxidation products were easier to be bio-consumed. Pure culture test showed that BPAF inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli, while ferrate oxidation completely eliminated this toxic effect. Co-existing humic acid (HA, 1 mg C/L to 5 mg C/L) decreased the removal of BPS and BPAF with ferrate. Compared with BPAF, more oxidation intermediates formed in the ferrate oxidation of BPS may be reduced by HA to the parent molecular. Thus, the inhibition effect of HA on the ferrate oxidation of BPS was more obvious than that on BPAF. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A new standard metric has been developed to express the actual adsorption capacity of the carbon electrode in consideration of the electrode reactions. The adsorption experiments were carried out by changing the cell potentials (0.6-1.6 V) in the MCDI unit cell. The point at which the electrode reactions occur was determined from the change in instantaneous charge efficiency during the adsorption process. Then, the total charge supplied to the carbon electrode at this point was defined as the maximum allowable charge (MAC). The MAC values were constant at 59 C/g irrespective of cell potentials. In addition, the salt adsorption capacity (SAC(MAC)) and the charge efficiency at MAC were approximately 16 mg/g and 91%, respectively, regardless of the cell potentials. Furthermore, the equivalent circuit analysis for the MCDI cell revealed that Faradaic reactions rarely occur at the MAC. The MAC is the maximum charge that can be supplied to the carbon electrode without electrode reactions. It is also unaffected by the cell components and operating conditions of the MCDI cell. Therefore, the MAC is expected to be a useful metric to objectively express the actual adsorption capacity of the carbon electrode. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The kinetics and transformation pathway of acetaminophen (APAP) in natural surface water (one sample from the Yangtze River and three others from different lakes), and the changes of aquatic microbes in surface water were revealed in this study. Both photochemical and microbial reactions contributed to the transformation of APAP under irradiance of 1.0-250 mW/cm(2). Microbial compositions were significantly different among surface water, and same microbial transformation product (1,4-bezoquinone) was detected as the predominant biotransformation intermediate in four studied surface water, but the lag phase (12-50-h) for the transformation was highly dependent on the aquatic microbial abundance and composition. The lag phase no longer existed with irradiance increased to 5.9 mW/cm(2). Aquatic microbial abundance and composition were influenced by the presence of APAP and radiation, and the influence extent was dependent on microbial species. The findings demonstrated that the individual contribution of biotic and abiotic process to the overall transformation of APAP and maybe other phenol in surface water varied as the background composition of surface water and the external environment changed, and biotransformation dominated (>73%) the overall transformation of APAP in surface water.

AB Glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) is a widespread glycoprotein found to have strong ability of sequestering heavy metals in soils. However, the underlying mechanism for metal and metalloid removal as well as water quality improvement and the ecological role played by GRSP are still not well documented. This study was initiated to investigate the interconnection of metal loading in GRSP between sediments and suspended solids, focusing on the mobilization mechanisms of GRSP in the coastal mangrove wetland. Combined indicators of nine heavy metals were significantly positively correlated with GRSP concentration by Principal Component Analysis, indicating that GRSP could act as an indicator of contamination level in the mangrove wetlands. Large distribution of GRSP in sediments and suspended solids elevated sequestration potential of heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Cr, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cd, Pb) and metalloid arsenic in the mangrove aquatic ecosystem. GRSP mobilized and sequestered heavy metals in sediment profiles, which reduced the bioavailability of heavy metals. GRSP was also a significant contributor for suspended solids to adsorb heavy metals, enhancing suspended solids deposition and burial process in sediments. This new finding provided insights into the ecological functions of GRSP and the heavy metal cycling in wetland environments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The searches for suitable substrates with high capacity for phosphorus (P) removal and promoting denitrification for enhancing nitrogen (N) removal have been a key work in constructed wetlands (CWs) research in the past several decades. But few substrates enhancing simultaneous long-term N and P removal in CWs have been found before. In this study, two subsurface flow pilot-scale wetlands using natural pyrite and limestone as substrates were constructed. After 3 year of operation, we found that pyrite had no negative effects on growth of reeds, removals of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), but enhanced long-term total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) removals in constructed wetland. In the three years, the average TP and TN removals of pyrite constructed wetland (PCW) were 87.7 +/- 14.2% with 0.25 +/- 0.20 mg/L of average effluent TP and 69.4 +/- 21.4% with 4.0 +/- 3.2 mg/L of average effluent TN, respectively. The main P form in the PCW was (Fe + Al)-bound P. The mechanisms of the PCW with enhanced simultaneous long-term N and P removals were anaerobic and aerobic oxidations of pyrite. The main bacteria were Anaeromyxobacter (4.9%), Ramlibacter (4.8%), Defluviicoccus (4.2%), Azoarcus (3.7%), Geobacter (3.4%), and they were highly related to anaerobic and aerobic oxidation of pyrite in the PCW.

AB Hydrological control of lakes has been increasingly practiced in many parts of the world, however, the long-term ecological impact of hydrological regulation and their dependence on lake impoundment intensity has been rarely examined. We combined a spatial survey of surface sediments with sediment core analyses to quantify the limnological changes over the last two centuries for an oligo-mesotrophic lake, which was dammed in 1957 and reinforced during 1987-1990, respectively. A water depth inference model constructed from surface sediment clay components was applied to a well-dated sediment core for water level reconstruction. The inferred water depth increased from 6.2 +/- 0.9 m to 8.7 +/- 1.7 m after dam construction and further to 13.6 +/- 2.6 m after dam enforcement, resulting in an increase in the magnitude of water level fluctuation (WLF). Accordingly, bulk sediment C/N ratio and median grain size spiked in similar to 1957 and similar to 1990, respectively, reflecting a large input of terrestrial sources due to impoundment. With a consistent loss of littoral zone and benthic diatoms over time, a significant decrease in C/N ratio and an abrupt depletion of carbon isotopic signal suggested a shift of carbon transfer towards a pelagic pathway after similar to 1990. While there was a significant increase in algal production since similar to 1990, the accumulation rate of carbon and nitrogen burial displayed an accelerating drop since similar to 1957, reflecting a diluting effect derived from expanding water storage. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in both the ratio between inorganic and organic carbon fluxes and sediment burial of inorganic carbon, reflecting enhanced degradation and low storage of aquatic organic carbon in stratified deep waters since similar to 1990. Hydro-morphological variables were found to exert strong impact on diatom communities, with an increasing interplay with nutrient and climate variables over time. While there existed a significant shift of diatom composition in similar to 1960, species richness and community dissimilarity showed a significant decrease when water depth was raised to above similar to 10 m or the magnitude of WFL was above similar to 2 m. Thus, our sediment surveys provide evidence on the significant impact of lake regulation on hydro morphology, carbon burial and ecological shift over time, as well as its stronger interaction with other forcing with increased impoundment intensity.

AB Natural wetlands are green infrastructure systems that are energy-efficient for wastewater treatment and can be found in diverse geo-environmental settings around the world. Their structure and functions, which defines the treatment efficiencies are highly varied. Wetlands over shallow bedrock and geological lineaments (weak zones) have been known to contribute to groundwater contamination. However, not many studies have been performed to understand the structure in different geological settings to identify the efficiency determining factors. Therefore, it is important to investigate the geological suitability of the natural wetlands. We examined wastewater fed natural wetlands in diverse geological settings aiming at studying the depth, geo-stability, bio-chemical interactions, and hydrogeological attributes that improve the wastewater quality, within the Musi River basin, India. The integrated geophysical scans encompassing electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), hydrogeological test, bathymetric study and hydro chemical analysis were carried out to explore the physical structure and hydro-dynamic processes in the wetlands. ERT investigations showed that, the depth to bedrock up to 20-25 m devoid of geo-fractures (lineaments) indicated the effective depth of saturated zone as a passable scope for potential bio-chemical interactions, implying the proportionality of the deep seated (deep bedrock) wetland to the pollutant removal efficiency. The lower order of electrical resistivity range 10-35 Omega m and hydraulic conductivity 2.938 md(-1) acquired for saturated weathered zone were found catalyzing the bioremediation, sedimentation, adsorption, redox reactions and ion exchange processes. It caused the deep seated wetland removing nitrate 194.34 kgd(-1) (97.18%); sulphate 333.75 kgd(-1) (77.70%); phosphate 9.66 kgd(-1) (82.53%); microbes 99.99%, BOD 80%, and COD 80% load with discharge 1408 m(3)d(-1) of treated wastewater. Further, the strategies for designating the natural wetlands as wastewater treatment systems are also discussed in this paper. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Riparian zones can receive large amounts of nitrate, potentially contributing to water pollution. Denitrification is a major pathway to remove nitrate. Previous research on riparian denitrification focused on natural factors, but frequently neglected the roles of human activity, such as pesticide accumulations. Here, we combined field investigations and exposure experiments to reveal the responses of denitrification and N2O emission to chlorothalonil (CTN, a common pesticide) in column experiments with riparian sediments. In this study, CTN inhibited denitrification and led to nitrate accumulation in sediments. Furthermore, (TN significantly increased N2O emission by 208-377%, and this response was regulated by N2O reductase (NOS) activity rather than nosZ abundance. A mechanistic study indicated that the critical step (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 3-phosphogylcerate) catalyzed by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase during microbial metabolism greatly influenced denitrification in CTN-polluted sediments. Our data also revealed that CTN declined electron donor NADH, electron transport system, and denitrifying enzyme activities during denitrification. Such responses suggested that CTN deteriorated sediment denitrification by inhibiting electron production, transport and consumption in denitrifiers. Additionally, structure equation modeling indicated that NOS was the key factor in predicting denitrification rate in CTN-polluted sediments. Overall, this is the first study to explore the effects of pesticide on denitrification and N2O emission in riparian zones at microbial metabolism level. Our results suggest that the safety threshold of CTN accumulation for inhibiting sediment denitrification is approximately 2 mg kg(-1), and imply that the wide presence of pesticides in riparian zones could impact eutrophication control of aquatic ecosystems.

AB A recently discovered bisulfite(HSO3-)/permanganate(MnO4-) system was reported to produce highly reactive free Mn(III) that can oxidize organic compounds in milliseconds. However, this characteristic reactivity was not found in all other known reaction systems that can also produce free Mn(III). Why can Mn(III) in NaHSO3/KMnO4 be so active? Here, we found NaHSO3 and O-2 acted as catalysts for the reaction between Mn(III) and organic compounds. Without O-2, 0% of organic compounds were oxidized in NaHSO3/KMnO4, indicating the absence of O-2 inactivated Mn(III) reactivity. When the reaction between NaHSO3 and KMnO4 was monitored in air, Mn(III) catalyzed rapid oxidation of NaHSO3 by O-2. Then, the Mn(III) that could oxidize organic compounds was found to be the ones involved in the catalytic reaction between NaHSO3 and O-2, thus the link between O-2 and Mn(III) reactivity was established. Finally, NaHSO3/O-2 can be viewed as catalysts for the reaction between Mn(III) and organic compounds because 1) when Mn(III) was involved in oxidizing organic compounds, it stopped being the catalyst for the reaction between NaHSO3 and O-2 so that they were consumed to a much smaller extent; and 2) without NaHSO3 and O-2, Mn(III) lost its oxidation ability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on "catalytic role exchange" where Mn(III) is the catalyst for NaHSO3/O-2 reaction while NaHSO3/O-2 are the catalysts for Mn(III)/organic compounds reaction. Understanding the critical role of oxygen in NaHSO3/KMnO4 will enable us to apply this technology more efficiently toward contaminant removal. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dissolved oxygen is a key player in water quality. Stratified water bodies show distinct vertical patterns of oxygen concentration, which can originate from physical, chemical or biological processes. We observed a pronounced metalimnetic oxygen minimum in the low-nutrient Rappbode Reservoir, Germany. Contrary to the situation in the hypolimnion, measurements of lateral gradients excluded the sediment contact zone from the major sources of oxygen depletion for the metalimnetic oxygen minimum. Instead, the minimum was the result of locally enhanced oxygen consumption in the open water body. A follow-up monitoring included multiple chlorophyll a fluorescence sensors with high temporal and vertical resolution to detect and document the evolution of phytoplankton. While chlorophyll fluorescence sensors with multiple channels detected a mass development of the phycoerythrin-rich cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens in the metalimnion, this species was overlooked by the commonly used single channel chlorophyll sensor. The survey indicated that the waning P. rubescens fluorescence was responsible for the oxygen minimum in the metalimnion. We hypothesize that pelagic processes, i.e., either oxygen use through decomposition of dead organic material originating from P. rubescens or P. rubescens extending its respiration beyond its photosynthetic activity, induced the metalimnetic oxygen minimum. The deeper understanding of the oxygen dynamics is mandatory for optimizing reservoir management. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Denitrifying sulfur conversion-associated enhanced biological phosphorous removal (DS-EBPR) system is not only a novel wastewater treatment process, but also an ideal model for microbial ecology in a community context. However, it exists the knowledge gap on the roles and interactions of functional microorganisms in the DS-EBPR system for carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) bio-conversions. We use genome-resolved metagenomics to build up an ecological model of microbial communities in a lab-scale DS-EBPR system with stable operation for more than 400 days. Our results yield 11 near-complete draft genomes that represent a substantial portion of the microbial community (39.4%). Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) promote complex metabolic processes and interactions for C, N, P and S conversions. Bins 1-4 and 10 are considered as new potential polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs), in which Bins 1-4 can be considered as S-related PAOs (S-PAOs) with no previously cultivated or reported members. Our findings give an insight into a new ecological system with C, N, P and S simultaneous bioconversions and improve the understanding of interactions among SRB, SOB, denitrifiers and PAOs within a community context.

AB This study (i) examined the formation of two major carbonaceous disinfection by-products (C-DBPs), trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs), during the chlorination of intracellular algogenic organic matter (IOM) extracted from two commonly blooming algae M. aerugittosa (MA) and Chlorella sp. (CH), and (ii) investigated the roles and relationships of fluorescent and molecular weight (MW) properties on/with IOM-derived THMs and HAAs. The extracted IOM samples were separated into different MW fractions by centrifugal devices with membrane support with MW cut-offs of 100, 30, 10, 3, and 1 kDa. We observed an overall reduction of C-DBPs with a decrease of IOM-MW from >100 kDa to <1 kDa. Of six fractionated IOM, a large fraction (>100 kDa) contributed the largest amount to the MW distribution of IOM, accounting for 33 and 42% of the total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of MA and CH, respectively. It also had the highest-yielding potential to produce significant levels of THMs and HAM, and total C-DBPs over other small MW fractions. Although small MW fractions (>10 kDa) contributed around 50% of the total DOC, they made an insignificant contribution (>20%) to the THMs, HAM, and overall C-DBPs. Furthermore, the decrease of IOM MW caused a shift from the domination of HAA formation to THM formation, especially when MW was <10 kDa. By canonical correspondent analysis, the relationship of IOM-derived THMs and HAAs with IOM properties was examined. In particular, large fractions of IOM, exhibiting aromatic protein- (AP) and soluble microbial product- (SMP) like fluorescence, are favorable for the formation of HAAs, whereas small MW fractions of IOM with HA- and FA-like fluorescence preferentially tends to form THMs. Our findings evidently show the strong dependence of IOM-derived THMs and HAAs on the fluorescent and MW properties. Therefore, the characterization of MW and fluorescent properties can provide the advantages in the control of algae-derived DBPs upon the chlorination of eutrophic water. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) has been recently used as an additive to pretreat waste activated sludge (WAS) to enhance short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production. However, the mechanisms of how PMS enhances SCFAs production remain largely unknown. This work therefore aims to explore the mechanisms through deeply understanding its impact on the disintegration of sludge cells, the biodegradability of organics released and the bioprocesses involved in anaerobic fermentation, and differentiating the contributions of its degradation intermediates to SCFAs production. This was demonstrated by a series of batch fermentation tests using either real sludge or model organic compounds as fermentation substrates. Experimental results showed that the maximal SCFAs yield increased from 29.69 to 311.67 mg COD/g VSS with PMS level increasing from 0 to 0.09 gig TSS. No obvious increase in SCFAs yield was observed when PMS further increased. The mechanism explorations revealed that PMS pretreatment not only enhanced the disintegration of sludge cells but also promoted the biodegradability of organics released, thereby providing more biodegradable substrates for subsequent SCFAs production. PMS pretreatment decreased the percentages of fulvic acid-like and humic acid-like substances in the released organics. Moreover, the species and total detection frequency of other recalcitrant organics such as cyclopentasiloxane, hepta-siloxane, and ethylene glycol, which were hardly degraded in ordinary anaerobic condition, also decreased remarkably. Although PMS caused harms to some extents to all the microbes in the anaerobic fermentation, its inhibitions to SCFAs consumers were much severer than that to SCFAs producers, probably due to the less tolerance of methanogens. Further analyses exhibited that O-1(2), SO4 center dot- and center dot OH were the major contributors to the increased SCFAs production, and their contributions were in the order of O-1(2) > SO4 center dot- > center dot OH. The findings obtained in this work provide insights into PMS-involved sludge fermentation process and might have important implication for further manipulation of WAS treatment in the future.

AB Phenolic moieties in natural organic matter (NOM) are important precursors of disinfection by-products (DBPs). In this study, the formation of chloral hydrate from chlorination of seventeen phenolic compounds, including mono-, di- and tri-hydroxybenzenes, were evaluated and the role of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) pre-oxidation on its formation pathways was explored. Chloroform, was also evaluated for comparison. Chlorination of resorcinol exhibited the highest chloral hydrate yield (2.83 +/- 0.13%) followed by chlorination of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (0.61 +/- 0.03%). The median of chloral hydrate yields from the tested phenolic compounds was 0.22%. ClO2 pre-oxidation reduced the yields of chloroform from phenol derivatives by 37-97%, except 4-methoxyphenol, catechol and 2,3-dihydroxyphenol. On the contrary, ClO2 pre-oxidation of di- and tri-hydroxybenzenes tended to increase chloral hydrate yields in post-chlorination. Mixed results (both increases and decreases) were observed in chloral hydrate formation from chlorination of mono-hydroxybenzenes after ClO2 pre-oxidation. The changes of their formation were dependent on ClO2 pre-oxidation time and dosages. Identification of transformation products suggested that phenolic compounds were mainly converted to unsaturated carbonyl structures by ClO2. Chlorine substituted benzoquinones and cyclopent-4-ene-1,3-diones were important transformation products after a series of ring open, decarboxylation, hydrolysis and chlorine substitution reactions. The changes in the formation yields of chloral hydrate and chloroform were governed by the difference in initial phenolic precursors and the transformation products after ClO2 pre-oxidation. ClO2 pre-oxidation in water treatment can effectively reduce chloroform formation but may have a risk of increasing chloral hydrate formation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Reverse electrodialysis (RED) has vast potential as a clean, nonpolluting, and sustainable renewable energy source; however, pilot-scale RED studies employing real waters remain rare. This study reports the largest RED (1000 cell pairs, 250 m(2)) with municipal wastewater effluent (1.3-5.7 mS/cm) and seawater (52.9-53.8 mS/cm) as feed solutions. The RED stack was operated at a velocity of 1.5 cm/s and the pilot plant produced 95.8 W of power (0.38 W/m(2) (total membrane) or 0.76 W/m(cell pair)(2)). During operation of the RED, the inlet design of the stack, comprising thin spacers, and the water dissociation reaction at the cathode were revealed as vulnerabilities of the stack. Specifically, pressure drops at the fluid inlet parts had the most detrimental effects on power output due to clogged spacers around the inlet parts. In addition, precipitates resulting in inorganic fouling were inevitable during the water dissociation reaction due to significant potential generated by the stack in the cathode chamber. Na+ and Cl- accounted for the majority of ions transferred from seawater to wastewater effluent through ion exchange membranes (IEMs). Moreover, some divalent cations in seawater, Mg2+ and Ca2+, were also transferred to the wastewater effluent. Some organics with relatively low molecular weights in the wastewater effluent passed through the IEMs, and their hydrophobic properties elevated the specific UV absorbance (SUVA) level in the seawater.

AB The emergence of resistance to antibacterial drugs and pesticides in water is unprecedented. This may have adverse consequences to human health and ecological systems. This paper first sought the identification of a wide range of pharmaceuticals and pesticides in two secondary effluent wastewaters (SEW) of different quality characteristics, followed by their removal by ferrate(VI) (Fe(VI), FeO42-) Screening for 22 pharmaceuticals and 32 pesticides, revealed that 11 pharmaceuticals and 3 pesticides in SEW of plant A, and 14 pharmaceuticals and 5 pesticides in SEW of plant B were present at concentrations higher than the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method quantitation limit. The concentrations of pharmaceuticals and pesticides ranged from 0.15 ng/L-413.03 ng/L. Investigation of the removal of these pharmaceuticals and pesticides by Fe(VI) showed that some had recalcitrant activity towards their oxidation. Acid-activated Fe(VI) resulted in enhanced oxidation (12.6%-56.2% degradation efficiency) of 6 and 7 pharmaceuticals in SEW of plant A and plant B, respectively, at a shorter time than Fe(VI) without activation (i.e. 3-5 min versus 15-30 min). The degradation of 1 and 3 pesticides in SEW of plant A and plant B respectively, has also been enhanced by activating Fe(VI) (13.8%-86.2% degradation efficiency). Results on testing of organic matter characterization of treated SEW with and without acid-activated Fe(VI) treatment are also presented. Acid-activated Fe(VI) treatment has potential in enhancing the removal of micropollutants in real wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Glycerol for the co-production of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) and caproate has a great prospect. Yet, its technical difficulty lies in the enhancement of caproate productivity, which requires the presence of ethanol as a co-substrate and necessitates the co-existence of functional microbes for glycerol fermentation and chain elongation. This study successfully achieved 6.38 mM degrees C 1,3-PDO d(-1) and 2.95 mM degrees C caproate d(-1) in a 2-L mixed-cultured semi-continuous fermenter with a glycerol-ethanol-acetate stoichiometric ratio of 4:3:1. Such conversions were mainly facilitated by a microbial community of Eubacterium limosum, Clostridium kluyveri and Massilibacterium senegalense. With such a synergistic microbiome, the co-production of 1,3-PDO and caproate was achieved from glycerol without ethanol addition. Based on metagenomics, E. limosum is capable of converting glycerol to 1,3-PDO, ethanol and H-2, and also redirecting the electron potential of H-2 into acetate via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, which is then used for chain elongation. C kluyveri worked synergistically with E. limosum by consuming ethanol and acetate for caproate production. M. senegalense encodes for ethanol oxidation to acetate and butyrate, facilitating the generation of these intermediates for C kluyveri elongation to caproate. During the transition between fermentation and elongation, an unexpected observation of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) formation and reutilization by M. senegalense may be associated with butyrate formation for further caproate generation. The knowledge gleaned from the substrate constitute, microbial consortium and their synergetic metabolism demonstrates a resource upgrade potential for crude glycerol or glycerol-containing wastewater generated from the biodiesel industry.

AB Number of populations, industry, and economic activities in Indonesia are growing rapidly and these impacts on natural environments raise awareness about water quality issue over the country. Bandung Basin, one of the most growing rapidity urban areas in Indonesia, was assessed for NO3- contamination in groundwater systems, and its controlling factors and driving mechanisms were investigated with the aim to demonstrate novelty on the use of combination of parameters of stable isotope ratios in nitrate (delta N-15 and delta O-18 in NO3-), groundwater age (using CFC-12 age tracer), and socioeconomic parameters (land-use, population, and economic database). Groundwater NO3- concentrations at present time did not exceed HWO limit for all the analyzed samples (3.00 mg/L in average with maximum value of 20.69 mg/L, n = 102). Dual stable isotopic analysis together with CFC-12 groundwater age determination suggest that anthropogenic activities are the major causes for increasing NO3- concentrations in groundwater. Those activities under respective land-use are industrial and domestic wastes for urban areas and chemical fertilizers for paddy and plantations areas. In general shallow unconfined aquifer is more vulnerable to NO3- contamination compared with deep confined aquifer because denitrification partly occurs in deep anoxic aquifer and this led attenuation of NO3- pollution in groundwater flowing. However, it seems likely at groundwater depression cones in urban areas that more concentrated waters are transported from shallow aquifer into deep aquifer system through downward vertical fluxes due to excessive pumping. Principal component analysis (PCA) on NO3- concentrations with socioeconomic parameters indicated that industrial and population growths are the main factors related to groundwater NO3- contamination. This result corresponds to CFC-age dating which shows younger (more recently recharged) groundwaters as being more contaminated than older ones do. Our study implies that NO3- contamination in this area may become more severe in future with a lack of necessary controls and treatment for human-induced nitrogen sources. Proposed approach is useful to understand how the NO3- contaminant behaves in large basin aquifer system under urban environments and might be applicable in other developing regions too because increasing populations may be associated with increasing nitrogen loadings.

AB As potable reuse guidelines and regulations continue to develop, the presence of N-nitrosamines is a primary concern because of their associated health concerns. In this study, bench-, pilot-, and full-scale tests were conducted to focus on the occurrence and treatment of N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) in United States (U.S.) potable reuse systems. Out of twelve U.S. wastewater effluents collected, ambient NMOR was detected in eleven (average = 20 +/- 18 ng/L); in contrast, only two of the thirteen surface water and stormwater samples had NMOR. Across all of these samples maximum formation potential by chloramination produced an average increase of 3.6 +/- 1.8 ng/L. This result underscores the need to understand the sources of NMOR as it is not likely a disinfection byproduct and it is not known to be commercially produced within the U.S. At the pilot-scale, three potable reuse systems were evaluated for ambient NMOR with oxidation (i.e., chlorination and ozonation), biofiltration, and granular activated carbon (GAC). Both pre-oxidation and biofiltration were ineffective at mitigating NMOR during long-term pilot plant operation (at least eight-months). GAC adsorbers were the only pilot-scale treatment to remove NMOR; however, complete breakthrough occurred rapidly from <2000 to 10,000 bed volumes. For comparison, a full-scale reverse osmosis (RO) potable reuse system was monitored for a year and confirmed that RO effectively removes NMOR. Systematic bench-scale UV-advanced oxidation experiments were undertaken to assess the mitigation potential for NMOR. At a fluence dose of 325 +/- 10 mJ/cm(2), UV alone degraded 90% of the NMOR present. The addition of 5 mg/L hydrogen peroxide did not significantly decrease the UV dose required for one-log removal. These data illustrate that efficient NMOR removal from potable reuse systems is limited to RO or UV treatment. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB EtBE is a fuel oxygenate that is synthesized from (bio)ethanol and fossil-based isobutylene, and replaces the fossil-based MtBE. Biodegradation of EtBE to harmless metabolites or end products can reduce the environmental and human health risks after accidental release. In this study, an algal-bacterial culture enriched from contaminated groundwater was used to (i) assess the potential for EtBE degradation, (ii) resolve the EtBE degradation pathway and (iii) characterize the phylogenetic composition of the bacterial community involved in EtBE degradation in contaminated groundwater. In an unamended microcosm, algal growth was observed after eight weeks when exposed to a day-night light cycle. In the fed-batch reactor, oxygen produced by the algae Scenedesmus and Chlorella was used by bacteria to degrade 50 mu M EtBE replenishments with a cumulative total of 1250 mu M in a day/night cycle (650 lux), over a period of 913 days. The microbial community in the fed-batch reactor degraded EtBE, using a P450 mono-oxygenase and 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA mutase, to tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), ethanol and CO2 as determined using C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and gas chromatography. Stable isotope probing (SIP) with C-13(6) labeled EtBE in a fed-batch vessel showed no significant difference in community profiles of the C-13 and C-12 enriched DNA fractions, with representatives of the families Halomonadaceae, Shewanellaceae, Rhodocyclaceae, Oxalobacteraceae, Comamonadaceae, Sphingomonadaceae, Hyphomicrobiaceae, Candidatus Moranbacteria, Omnitrophica, Anaerolineaceae, Nocardiaceae, and Blastocatellaceae. This is the first study describing micro-oxic degradation of EtBE by an algal-bacterial culture. This algal-bacterial culture has advantages compared with conventional aerobic treatments: (i) a lower risk of EtBE evaporation and (ii) no need for external oxygen supply in the presence of light. This study provides novel leads towards future possibilities to implement algal-bacterial consortia in field-scale groundwater or wastewater treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Disinfected drinking water contains hundreds of disinfection by-products (DBPs) that are formed by the reaction of disinfectants with natural and anthropogenic organic matter, bromide, and iodide. Understanding what these DBPs are is important because millions of people worldwide consume drinking water every day, and human epidemiologic studies have reported cancer, miscarriage, and birth defects from consuming such waters. While more than 600 DBPs are reported in the literature, very few studies quantify complete classes of chlorinated, brominated, and iodinated DBPs. Also, very few studies conduct comprehensive non-target analyses of unknown DBPs to characterize the complete DBP exposure (the exposome). We developed a new gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS) method that simultaneously quantifies 39 priority unregulated DBPs from six different chemical classes (haloacetaldehydes, haloketones, haloacetamides, haloacetonitriles, halonitromethanes, and iodinated-trihalomethanes) and analyzes unknown DBPs with mass accuracy <600 ppm under full-scan conditions. Using a new type of time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer, which combines selected ion monitoring (SIM)-level sensitivity with mass accuracy of +/- 0.05 Da, method detection limits of 3-61 ng/L were achieved. These levels were found to be quite comparable to those of a widely used single quadrupole mass spectrometer (2-90 ng/L) operated in SIM mode. However, analysis using this TOF mass spectrometer offers two additional advantages over traditional quadrupole-MS: (1) full-scan data, which provides additional confidence for target analytes, as well as complete mass spectra for unknown analysis, and (2) two decimal place mass accuracy, which allows additional confidence for target analytes and importantly, molecular formula indication for unknowns. High resolution accurate mass TOF was also used to validate identification of selected compounds. This new method was demonstrated on finished drinking waters from three different drinking water plants, where target quantification and non target unknown analyses were performed simultaneously during the same run. This enabled the quantification of 39 DBPs, along with the non-target identification of many other drinking water contaminants, including two additional non-target DBPs: N,N-dimethylacetamide and N-nitrosodibutylamine.

AB 2-Phosphonobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid (PBTCA) is an antiscalant that is widely used in reverse osmosis (RO) systems. Because of its high concentration in RO concentrate, eutrophication risk and anti precipitation properties may affect subsequent treatments, therefore treatment strategies are needed to eliminate such substances. In this study, PBTCA was degraded by ozonation. The results show that PBTCA reacted with ozone molecules and hydroxyl radicals, with second-order rate constants of (0.12 +/- 0.002) and (7.83 +/- 1.51) x 10(8) L mol(-1) s(-1), respectively. The phosphorus in PBTCA (P-p) was transformed into organic phosphorus except for PBTCA (P-o), and inorganic phosphorus (P-I); P-o was further transformed into P-I. The changes in the concentrations of these phosphorus forms were investigated by model simulation. Simulation showed that the rate of P-p transformation into P-o was 5.5 times higher than that into P-I. PBTCA was ozonated much faster at alkaline pH than at acidic pH. This is ascribed to different amounts of ozone molecules and hydroxyl radicals, and their different reaction rates with PBTCA. Furthermore, anti-precipitation property was reduced during ozonation, as shown by the amounts and morphology changes of the precipitates. PBTCA concentration for 50% anti-precipitation (AP(50)) did not change during ozonation, indicating that the transformation products generated during ozonation did not have anti-precipitation effects. Phosphorus in PBTCA was removed by ozonation coagulation treatment. Total phosphorus and inorganic phosphorus were removed efficiently by using ferric chloride as a coagulant. The coagulants tended to bind with inorganic phosphorus to form flocs. Meanwhile, flocs were more easily to aggregate and precipitate as anti-precipitation effect was gradually removed, thus more phosphorus was removed. A combination of ozonation and coagulation removed PBTCA effectively and simultaneously reduced its anti-precipitation property and phosphorus. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Textile dyeing wastewater is characterized by low biodegradability and high nitrogen strength, which is difficult to meet the increasingly stringent discharge requirements. Therefore, the tertiary nutrient and refractory organics removal is considered and aerated biofilter is often adopted. However, the aerobic condition and carbon source shortage restrict tertiary biological nitrogen removal. In this study, iron scrap was introduced as the filter medium to enhance the pollutant removal capacity, and three aerobic biofilters were constructed. Biofilter Fe-CE was filled with iron scrap and ceramisite; biofilter Fe-AC was added with iron scrap and granular activated carbon, and biofilter CE only had ceramisite to pad as control system. After the biofilters were acclimatized by synthetic wastewater and actual dyeing wastewater, the optimal operation parameters based on nitrogen removal were determined as pH 7, gas water ratio 5:1, hydraulic retention time 8 h and C/N ratio 8.5:1. The iron scraps improved total nitrogen (TN) removal significantly, with TN removal efficiency of 68.7% and 57.3% in biofilter Fe-AC and biofilter Fe-CE, comparing with biofilter CE of 29.9%. Additionally, phosphorus and COD had better removal performance as well when iron scrap existed. Further investigation interpreted the reason for iron's facilitating effect on tertiary nutrient and refractory organics removal. The introduction of iron scrap made the habitat conditions such as pH values, DO concentrations and biomass contents inside the biofilters change towards the direction beneficial for pollutant elimination especially for nitrogen removal. In iron containing biofilters, the majority of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic pollutants were removed in the iron scrap layers, and more pollutants types appeared, implying that iron triggered pollutants to go through more diverse degradation or transformation pathways. Moreover, the phylum Proteoabcteria dominated in samples of ceramisite-containing biofilters, with abundances more than 40%. The iron scrap existence increased the abundances of phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, and triggered higher abundance of denitrification bacteria. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mixing should be optimized in anaerobic digestion (AD) systems to achieve excellent biomaterials production in the sewage sludge (SS) management in wastewater treatment plant. AD depends on the coordinated activity of hydrolysis, acidification and methanogenesis. However, the effect of mixing intensity on characteristics of hydrolysis and acidification in AD of SS is still poorly understood. This study focused on the mixing intensity (30, 60, 90 and 120 rpm) effect on the characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the key microorganisms in the hydrolysis and acidification of SS. Results showed that enhanced hydrolysis and acidification efficiency was obtained at mixing of 90 and 120 rpm (p < 0.05), while the maximum acetic acid (388 +/- 21 mg/L) was produced at 90 rpm. Mixing at 90 rpm enhanced the release of protein and polysaccharide as well as humic acid. Further analyses of DOM molecular features revealed that 90 rpm led to the highest molecular diversity and easily biodegradable molecules (lipid and proteins/amino sugars), which contributed to the maximum hydrolysis and acidification efficiency. Firmicutes and Actinobacteria significantly increased with mixing intensity (p<0.05), and Chloroflexi and Fusobacteria were enriched at mixing of 90 rpm, which favored the hydrolysis of SS. The enrichment of Clostridium XI and Clostridium sensu strict contributed to the acidification of DOM at 90 and 120 rpm. The results of this study can advance our knowledge about mixing intensity effects on the AD systems of SS. This research also showed how increasing mixing intensity to a relatively high speed can enhance the hydrolysis and acidification efficiency of SS. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The work provides a method on the basis of flow cytometry to evaluate the performance of denitrification biofilm during the preservation, reactivation and pilot-scale operation process. The viable cell ratio of denitrification biofilm significantly reduced and further led to the decrease of denitrification capacity after long-term preservation for 5 months. Protein component in tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances (TB-EPS) could serve to enhance microbial adhesion and promote denitrification biofilm formation. With the significant correlation of viable cell ratio and microbial characteristics, 4 degrees C was more appropriate for preserving denitrification biofilm and conducive to maintain the relatively high denitrification capacity. A maximum denitrification rate of 5.80 gNO(3)(-)N/m(2).d was obtained in pilot-scale anoxic-oxic (AO) process and Dechloromonas became greater prevalence in denitrification suspended carriers. Furthermore, the enrichment of Pseudomonas, Parcubacteria, Acidovorax, Aquabacterium and Unclassified_Flavobacteriaceae enhanced biofilm formation and nutrient conservation. The significantly positive correlation between viable cell ratio and the ratio of nitrate reduction to COD consumption was discovered, and the indices of Chao, ACE, Shannon and Simpson of denitrification biofilm were positively correlated with viable cell ratio, meaning that flow cytometry analysis was reasonable and suitable to evaluate the performances of denitrification biofilm.

AB Nitrogen (N) removal in conventional bioretention systems is highly variable owing to the low nitrate (NOS3-) elimination efficiency. We hypothesized that amending bioretention cells with biochar and zero-valent iron (ZVI) could improve the NO removal performance. A well-instrumented, bi-layer pilot-scale bioretention cell was developed to test the hypothesis by investigating its hydrologic performance and NO removal efficacy as affected by biochar and ZVI amendments. The cell containing 18% (v/v) wood biochar in the vadose zone and 10% (v/v) ZVI in the saturation zone was monitored for 18 months of field infiltration tests using synthetic stormwater amended with bromide (tracer) and NOS3-. Compared to the Control cell without amendments, the Biochar/ZVI cell increased water retention by 11-27% and mean residence time by 0.7-3.8 h. The vadose zone of the Biochar/ZVI cell removed 30.6-95.7% (0.6-12.7 g) of NO3-N from the influent, as compared with -6.1-89.6% (-0.1-2.9 g) by that of the Control cell. While the performance varied with synthetic storm events and seasons, in all cases the Biochar/ZVI cell resulted in greater NO removal than the Control cell. This improvement was presumably due to biochar's ability to improve water retention, facilitate anoxic conditions, increase residence time, and provide electrons for microbial denitrification. The saturation zone with ZVI amendment further promoted NO removal: removal was 1.8 times greater relative to the control in the first infiltration test, but was minimal in following tests. The reduction in performance of the ZVI amendment in subsequent tests might be due to diminished NO3-N input to the saturation zone after treatment by the biochar-amended vadose zone. The redox potential and dissolved oxygen content at the vadose/saturation zone interface also indicated more favorable denitrification conditions in the Biochar/ZVI cell. Biochar amendment demonstrated significant promise for increasing nitrate removal in bioretention systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Capacitive deionization (CDI) performance, as measured by salt adsorption capacity (SAC) and energy normalized adsorption of salt (ENAS), is frequently limited by anion repulsion at the positive electrode. In this work, we investigate the ability to prevent co-ion repulsion by increasing complementary fixed charged within the electrode macropores by binding composite CDI electrodes with the ionically charged structural polysaccharides chitosan and carboxymethyl cellulose. When employing asymmetrically charged electrode binders, co-ion repulsion was prevented, resulting in SAC and ENAS values that were three times greater than composite electrodes bound with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and similar to CDI electrodes composed of chemically modified carbon. Polysaccharide binders did not modify the charge balance in the carbon micropores but did shift the discharge voltage of maximum adsorption, enabling a shift in operating voltage that prolonged cycle lifetime without a significant loss in performance. The mechanism of improved salt accumulation with polysaccharide binders was explored with a one-dimensional model that integrated CDI and ion-exchange membrane covered (MCDI) sub-units. Model simulations indicate that carbon macropores covered with thin layers of charged polysaccharides increase adsorption by a sequential accumulation and release of salt to depleted uncovered pores.

AB Understanding the fate of overall antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during the biological treatment of antibiotic containing wastewater is a central issue for the water ecological safety assessment. Although the microbial electrode-respiration based biotransformation process could significantly detoxify some antibiotic contaminants, e.g. chloramphenicol (CAP), the response of CAP-reducing biocathode micro-biome and resistome to continuous electrical stimulation, especially ARGs network interactions, are poorly understood. Here, using highthroughput functional gene array (GeoChip v4.6) and Illumina 16S rRNA gene MiSeq sequencing, the structure, composition, diversity and network interactions of CAP reducing biocathode microbiome and resistome in response to continuous electrical stimulation were investigated. Our results indicate that the CAP bioelectroreduction process could significantly accelerate the elimination of antibacterial activity of CAP during CAP-containing wastewater treatment compared to the pure bioreduction process. Continuous electrical stimulation could obviously alter both the microbiome and resistome structures and consistently decrease the phylogenetic, functional and overall ARGs diversity and network complexity within the CAP -reducing biofilms. The relative abundances of overall ARGs and specific CAP resistance related major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter genes were significantly negatively correlated with the reduction efficiency of CAP to inactive antibacterial product AMCI (partially dechlorinated aromatic amine), which may reduce the ecological risk associated with the evolution of multidrug-resistant bacteria and ARGs during antibiotic-containing wastewater treatment process. This study offers new insights into the response of an antibiotic reducing biocathode resistome to continuous electrical stimulation and provides useful information on the assessment of overall ARGs risk for the bioelectrochemical treatment of antibiotic contaminants.

AB Drinking water supplies are increasingly affected by overlapping anthropogenic global change processes. As a key currency of ecosystem function in aquatic ecosystems, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and composition is sensitive to many global change processes. However, DOC must also be removed to avoid the production of harmful disinfection byproducts as water is processed. Thus, understanding the effects of global change processes on the seasonal and long-term dynamics of DOC composition and concentration is critical for ensuring the sustainability of drinking water supplies. To understand these dynamics, we analyzed a novel 11-year time series of stream water DOC concentration and composition using Weighted Regressions on Time Discharge and Season (WRTDS) to understand the influences of co-occurring changes in climate and atmospheric deposition. We also discuss the implications for water supply provision and management. We found that, during our study period, overlapping global change processes in the watershed had the net effect of increasing the DOC aromaticity, as measured by SUVA(254), at moderate to high discharge levels during the late spring and early summer and the autumn and early winter. However, changes in DOC concentration were more dynamic and we observed both increasing and decreasing trends depending on season and hydrologic state. During summer, at low to moderate flow levels we observed a significant (p < 0.05) increase in DOC concentration. During autumn, at moderate to high flow levels we observed a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in DOC concentration and an increase in SUVA(254). For drinking water providers, our results suggest that close monitoring of source waters must be coupled with the development of plans accounting for season- and hydrology-specific long-term changes.

AB The degradation of organic contaminants under high salinity condition is still a challenge for environmental remediation due to the inhibiting effect resulted from the side reactions between radicals and anions. Here, we demonstrate the non-radical oxidation process via peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation by metal-free carbon catalyst for efficiently decomposing bisphenol A (BPA) in saline water. The nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon (NGC700) exhibits excellent catalytic activity for depredating BPA at acid and neutral pH. Based on the scavenger experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses, the mechanism of catalytic oxidation was elucidated as the non-radical pathway, and singlet oxygen was identified as the primary reactive species. Experiments on the influence of anions (5 500 mM) further show that the inhibiting effect was overcame due to the non-radical process. Interestingly, Cl markedly facilitated the catalytic performance by generating HOCI in the catalytic process. The results highlight leveraging the non-radical pathway dominated by singlet oxygen to conquer the inhibitory effect of anions in NGC700/PMS system, which represents a crucial step towards environmental remediation under high salinity condition.

AB Biological nutrient removal performances and kinetics of autochthonous marine biomass in forms of activated sludge and aerobic granular sludge were investigated under different salinity and sludge retention time (SRT). Both the biomasses, cultivated from a fish-canning wastewater, were subjected to stepwise increases in salinity (+2 gNaCl L-1), from 30 gNaCl L-1 up to 50 gNaCl L-1 with the aim to evaluate the maximum potential in withstanding salinity by the autochthonous marine biomass. Microbial marine species belonging to the genus of Cryomorphaceae and of Rhodobacteraceae were found dominant in both the systems at the maximum salinity tested (50 gNaCl L-1). The organic carbon was removed with a yield of approximately 98%, irrespective of the salinity. Similarly, nitrogen removal occurred via nitritation-denitritation and was not affected by salinity. The ammonium utilization rate and the nitrite utilization rate were approximately of 3.60 mgNH(4)-N gVSS(-1)h(-1) and 10.0 mgNO(2)-N gVSS(-1)h(-1), respectively, indicating a high activity of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria. The granulation process did not provide significant improvements in the nutrients removal process likely due to the stepwise salinity increase strategy. Biomass activity and performances resulted affected by long SRT (27 days) due to salt accumulation within the activated sludge flocs and granules. In contrast, a lower SRT (14 days) favoured the discharge of the granules and flocs with higher inert content, thereby enhancing the biomass renewing.
   The obtained results demonstrated that the use of autochthonous-halophilic bacteria represents a valuable solution for the treatment of high-strength carbon and nitrogen saline wastewater in a wide range of salinity. Besides, the stepwise increase in salinity and the operation at low SRT enabled high metabolic activity and to avoid excessive accumulation of salt within the biomass aggregates, limiting their physical destructuration due to the increase in loosely-bound exopolymers.

AB Reducing human and ecological risks of groundwater nitrate contamination requires understanding the source of nitrate. Land use practices, such as agriculture and residential development, can increase groundwater nitrate concentrations. This study evaluated a chemical source-tracing suite that paired analysis of agricultural herbicide metabolites and human wastewater constituents. The source-tracing suite was tested in an area subject to nitrate from both agriculture and on-site waste ("septic") systems. Monitoring wells showed that agricultural contamination was deeper (>5 m) in the aquifer consistent with its origin a greater distance from wells and that on-site waste ("septic system") contamination was shallower in the aquifer (<3 m). Repeated sampling of seventeen household wells showed evidence of both agricultural and on-site waste contamination in wells with higher nitrate concentrations. The artificial sweeteners sucralose and acesulfame and the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole were the only septic system indicators consistently detected. Less persistent compounds, such as caffeine and acetaminophen, were never detected in the household wells indicating they were attenuated over the distance between septic system and well and reducing their utility as a tracer of septic system nitrate. Overall, there was a positive relationship between sucralose, acesulfame and nitrate in wells with low levels of agricultural contamination although the relationship varied between wells.

AB Wastewater discharges lead to the deterioration of receiving waters through treated effluents and bypasses, combined and sanitary sewer overflows, and cross-connections to storm sewers. The influence of weather conditions on fecal indicator bacteria, pathogens and wastewater micropollutants on raw and treated sewage concentrations has not been extensively characterized. However, such data are needed to understand the effects of by-pass discharges and incomplete treatment on receiving waters. A water resource recovery facility was monitored for pathogenic parasites (Cryptosporidium oocysts, Giardia cysts), fecal indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens), and wastewater micropollutants (caffeine, carbamazepine, 2-hydroxycarbamazepine, acesulfame, sucralose, and aspartame) during 6 events under different weather conditions (snowmelt and trace to 32 mm 2-day cumulative precipitation). Greater intra-and inter-event variability was observed for Giardia, E. coli and C perfringens than for studied WWMP5. Even with the addition of inflow and infiltration, daily variations dominated concentration trends. Thus, afternoon and early evening were identified as critical times with regards to high concentrations and flows for potential by-pass discharges. Peak concentrations of Giardia were observed during the June wet weather event (1010 cysts/L), with the highest flowrates relative to the mean monthly flowrate. Overall, Giardia, E. coli and C perfringens concentrations were positively correlated with flowrate (R > 0.32, p < 0.05). In raw sewage samples collected under high precipitation conditions, caffeine, carbamazepine and its metabolite 2-OH-carbamazepine were significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with Giardia, E. coli, and C perfringens demonstrating that they are useful markers for untreated sewage discharges. Data from the study are needed for estimating peak concentrations discharged from wastewater sources in relation to precipitation or snowmelt events. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In pristine sea ice-covered Arctic waters the potential of natural attenuation of oil spills has yet to be uncovered, but increasing shipping and oil exploitation may bring along unprecedented risks of oil spills. We deployed adsorbents coated with thin oil films for up to 2.5 month in ice-covered seawater and sea ice in Godthaab Fjord, SW Greenland, to simulate and investigate in situ biodegradation and photooxidation of dispersed oil.
   GC-MS-based chemometric methods for oil fingerprinting were used to identify characteristic signatures for dissolution, biodegradation and photooxidation. In sub-zero temperature seawater, fast degradation of n-alkanes was observed with estimated half-life times of similar to 7 days. PCR amplicon sequencing and qPCR quantification of bacterial genes showed that a biofilm with a diverse microbial community colonised the oil films, yet a population related to the psychrophilic hydrocarbonoclastic gammaproteobacterium Oleispira antarctica seemed to play a key role in n-alkane degradation. Although Oleispira populations were also present in sea ice, we found that biofilms in sea ice had 25 to 100 times lower bacterial densities than in seawater, which explained the non-detectable n-alkane degradation in sea ice. Fingerprinting revealed that photooxidation, but not biodegradation, transformed polycyclic aromatic compounds through 50 cm-thick sea ice and in the upper water column with removal rates up to similar to 1% per day.
   Overall, our results showed a fast biodegradation of n-alkanes in sea ice-covered seawater, but suggested that oils spills will expose the Arctic ecosystem to bio-recalcitrant PACs over prolonged periods of time. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nanoplastics (NPs) have been identified as newly emerging particulate contaminants. In marine environments, the interaction between NPs and other engineered nanoparticles remains unknown. This study investigated the cotransport of NPs with fullerene (C-60) in seawater-saturated columns packed with natural sand as affected by the mass concentration ratio of NPs/C-60 and the hydrochemical characteristics. In seawater with 35 practical salinity units (PSU), NPs could remarkably enhance C-60 dispersion with a NPs/(C60) ratio of 1. NPs behaved as a vehicle to facilitate C-60 transport by decreasing colloidal zeta-potential and forming stable primary heteroaggregates. As the NPs/C-60 ratio decreased to 1/3, NPs mobility was progressively restrained because of the formation of large secondary aggregates. When the ratio continuously decreased to 1/10, the stability and transport of colloids were governed by C-60 rather than NPs. Under this condition, the transport trend of binary suspensions was similar to that of single C-60 suspension, which was characterized by a ripening phenomenon. Seawater salinity is another key factor affecting the stability and associated transport of NPs and C-60. In seawater with 3.5 PSU, NPs and C-60 (1:1) in binary suspension exhibited colloidal dispersion, which was driven by a high-energy barrier. Thus, the profiles of the cotransport and retention of NPs/C-60 resembled those of single NPs suspension. This work demonstrated that the cotransport of NPs/C-60 strongly depended on their mass concentration ratios and seawater salinity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A lab-scale partial nitritation granular sludge air-lift reactor was operated in continuous mode treating low strength synthetic medium (influent ca. 50 mg-N-NH4+/L). Granules were initially stratified with AOB in the external shell and NOB in the inner core at 20 degrees C. Once temperature was decreased progressively from 20 degrees C to 15 degrees C, nitrate production was initially observed during several weeks. However, by maintaining relatively high ammonium concentrations in the liquid (ca. 28 mg-N-NH4+L), effluent nitrate concentrations in the reactor decreased in time and process performance was recovered. Batch tests were performed in the reactor at different conditions. To understand the experimental results an existing one-dimensional biofllm model was used to simulate batch tests and theoretically assess the impact of stratification, dissolved oxygen (DO) and short-term effects of temperature on time course concentrations of ammonium, nitrite and nitrate. This theoretical assessment served to develop an experimental methodology for the evaluation of in-situ batch tests in the partial nitritation reactor. These batch tests proved to be a powerful tool to easily monitor the extent of stratification of nitrifier guilds in granular sludge and to determine the required bulk ammonium concentration to minimize nitrite oxidation. When nitrifier guilds were stratified in the granular sludge, a higher bulk ammonium concentration was required to efficiently repress NOB at lower temperature (ca. 19 versus 7 mg-N-NH4+/L at 15 and 20 degrees C, respectively).

AB Point-of-use water treatment technologies can help mitigate risks from drinking water contamination, particularly for metals (and metalloids) that originate in distribution systems (e.g., chromium, lead, copper) or are naturally occurring in private groundwater wells (e.g., arsenic). Here, composite nano fibers of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) with embedded hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) nanoparticles were synthesized via a single-pot electrospinning synthesis. A core-shell nanofiber composite was also prepared through the subsequent hydrothermal growth of alpha-Fe2O3 nanostructures on embedded hematite composites. Properties of embedded hematite composites were controlled using electrospinning synthesis variables (e.g., size and loading of embedded alpha-Fe2O3 nanoparticles), whereas core-shell composites were also tailored via hydrothermal treatment conditions (e.g., soluble iron concentration and duration). Although uptake of Cu(II), Pb(II), Cr(VI), and As(V) was largely independent of the core-shell variables explored, metal uptake on embedded nanofibers increased with alpha-Fe2O3 loading. Both materials exhibited maximum surface-area-normalized sorption capacities that were comparable to alpha-Fe2O3 nanoparticle dispersions and exceeded that of a commercial iron oxide based sorbent. Further, both types of composite exhibited strong performance across a range of environmentally relevant pH values (6.0-8.0). Notably, core-shell structures, with a majority of surface accessible alpha-Fe2O3,a performed far better than embedded composites in kinetically limited flow through systems than was anticipated from their relative performance in equilibrium batch systems. Core-shell nanofiber filters also retained much of the durability and flexibility exhibited by embedded nanofibers. Additional tests with authentic groundwater samples demonstrated the ability of the core-shell nanofiber filters to remove simultaneously both As and suspended solids, illustrating their promise as a nano-enabled technology for point-of-use water treatment.

AB This study has been performed in the framework of a research program aiming to develop a low-cost aerial sensor for the monitoring of cyanobacteria in freshwater ecosystems that could be used for early detection. Several empirical and mechanistic remote-sensing tools have been already developed and tested at large scales and have proven useful in monitoring cyanobacterial blooms. However, the effectiveness of these tools for early detection is hard to assess because such work requires the detection of low concentrations of characteristic pigments amid complex ecosystems exhibiting several confounding factors (turbidity, blooms of other species, etc.). We developed a framework for performing high-throughput measurements of the absorbance and reflectance of small volumes (similar to = 20 mL) of controlled mixtures of phytoplankton species and studied the potential of this framework to validate remote-sensing proxies of cyanobacteria concentration. The absorption and reflectance spectra of single and multiple cultures carried a specific signal that allowed for the quantitative analysis of culture mixes. This specific signal was shown to be related to known pigment absorbance spectra. The concentrations of chlorophyll -a and -b, phycocyanin and phycoerythrin could be obtained from direct absorbance measurements and were correlated with the concentration obtained after pigment extraction (R-2 >= 0.96 for all pigments). A systematic test of every possible two-band and three-band normalized difference between optical indices was then performed, and the coincidental correlation with chlorophyll -b (absent in cyanobacteria) was used as an indicator of non-specificity. Two-band indices were shown to suffer from non-specificity issues and could not yield strong and specific relationships with phycocyanin or phycoerythrin (maximum R-2 < 0.5). On the other hand, the three-band modified normalized difference indices yielded strong specific relationships (R-2 > 0.8). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sediment capping with activated carbon (AC) is an effective technique used in remediation of contaminated sediments, but the ecological effects on benthic microbial activity and meiofauna communities have been largely neglected. This study presents results from a 4-week experiment investigating the influence of two powdered AC materials (bituminous coal-based and coconut shell-derived) and one control material (clay) on biogeochemical processes and meiofauna in contaminated sediments. Capping with AC induced a 62-63% decrease in denitrification and a 66-87% decrease in dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). Sediment porewater pH increased from 7.1 to 9.0 and 9.7 after addition of bituminous AC and biomass-derived AC, respectively. High pH (>8) persisted for at least two weeks in the bituminous AC and for at least 24 days in the coconut based AC, while capping with clay had no effect on pH. We observed a strong impact (nitrate fluxes being halved in presence of AC) on nitrification activity as nitrifiers are sensitive to high pH. This partly explains the significant decrease in nitrate reduction rates since denitrification was almost entirely coupled to nitrification. Total benthic metabolism estimated by sediment oxygen uptake was reduced by 30 and 43% in presence of bituminous coal based AC and coconut shell-derived AC, respectively. Meiofauna abundances decreased by 60-62% in the AC treatments. Taken together, these observations suggest that AC amendments deplete natural organic carbon, intended as food, to heterotrophic benthic communities. Phosphate efflux was 91% lower in presence of bituminous AC compared to untreated sediment probably due to its content of aluminum (Al) oxides, which have high affinity for phosphate. This study demonstrates that capping with powdered AC produces significant effects on benthic biogeochemical fluxes, microbial processes and meiofauna abundances, which are likely due to an increase in porewater pH and to the sequestration of natural, sedimentary organic matter by AC particles.

AB The combination of biological growth and particle loading can adversely affect hydraulic performance in drinking water biofilters. In this study, upstream oxidant addition was used to distribute biologically derived filter clogging in granular activated carbon (GAC) biofilters. Oxidant penetration was assessed during pilot-scale operation and backwashing of dual media (GAC/sand) and multimedia (GAC/anthra-cite/sand) biofilters. Influent chlorine (HOCI), monochloramine (NH2CI), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) residuals were optimized to react with the GAC surface in the upper portion of the filter media bed (depth < 0.5 m) to attenuate biomass development. As the oxidant residual was quenched by surface mediated reaction with the filter media, biomass growth was promoted deeper in the filter bed (depth > 0.5 m). The oxidant-induced effects on biomass and hydraulic performance were monitored through measurements of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and head loss accumulation at different media depths. Addition of oxidants (e.g., 0.6 mg Cl-2/L HOCI) could decrease terminal head loss by 20% in dual media filters and 40% in multimedia filters. These hydraulic benefits were achieved without significantly affecting removal of assimilable organic carbon (AOC), total organic carbon (TOC), turbidity, and particle counts. Oxidant type, residual concentration, media type, media age, and media depth influenced the passage of oxidant residuals and distribution of filter biomass. When oxidants were added during backwashing, oxidant residual was quenched through the bed depth from a combination of reactions with GAC media and biofilm degradation. This attenuation of residual oxidant may prevent the oxidant residual from penetrating the entire bed depth, potentially compromising backwashing objectives. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB The robustness of reverse osmosis (RO) against polar organic micropollutants (MPs) was investigated in pilot-scale drinking water treatment. Experiments were carried in hypoxic conditions to treat a raw anaerobic riverbank filtrate spiked with a mixture of thirty model compounds. The chemicals were selected from scientific literature data based on their relevance for the quality of freshwater systems, RO permeate and drinking water. MPs passage and the influence of permeate flux were evaluated with a typical low-pressure RO membrane and quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. A strong inverse correlation between size and passage of neutral hydrophilic compounds was observed. This correlation was weaker for moderately hydrophobic MPs. Anionic MPs displayed nearly no passage due to electrostatic repulsion with the negatively charged membrane surface, whereas breakthrough of small cationic MPs could be observed. The passage figures observed for the investigated set of MPs ranged from less than 1%-25%. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between physicochemical properties and passage. The effects of permeate flux were more pronounced for small neutral MPs, which displayed a higher passage after a pressure drop. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The understanding of fouling behavior and mechanism is critical for fouling control in membrane processes. This study adopted a novel fluorescence front-face excitation-emission matrix (FF-EEM) approach to characterize the fluorescence foulants deposited on membrane surface. Methods for quantifying protein and humic substances deposited on ultrafiltration (UF) membrane were established. Foulants deposited on the membrane surface during the UF of model foulants (bovine serum albumin (BSA) and humic acids (HA)) and wastewater effluent organic matter (EfOM) were quantified using the FF-EEM and liquid EEM coupled with mass balance calculation. The foulants mass data obtained by FF-EEM were further used to analyze fouling mechanism involved in UF. The FF-EEM based method was more accurate than the liquid EEM based method, as the problems associated with liquid EEM based method (such as the error propagation in the mass balance calculation and the ineffectiveness of inner filter correction) were avoided in FF-EEM based method. The fouling resistance did not correlate well with the amount of foulants, as the major fouling mechanism instead of the mass of foulants mainly determined the extent of fouling. This work demonstrated FF-EEM could be a powerful tool for investigating fouling evolution and fouling mechanism in UF process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Two particular aspects of volume boundary layer mesh generation applied to non smooth geometries are considered in this work. First, the treatment of concave ridges and corners is tackled from a generic viewpoint. Entropy satisfying elements are generated where shocks form in the volume. This proves useful to avoid premature halt of the boundary layer, and therefore potential jumps in the normal size. The connection with the Voronoi diagram is commented. Second, boundary layer adaptivity in the tangential plane is considered to honor arbitrary sizing prescription, and avoid size mismatch between the boundary layer and the isotropic sizing.
   It is shown that a strict semi-structured framework has to be abandoned in general to accommodate changes in the mesh topology. Size transition between boundary layer and fully unstructured anisotropic mesh is automatically taken into account. Both the concavity problem and the tangential adaptivity are presented together, since they require similar mesh operators. Various numerical examples illustrate the method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ID NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; TURBULENT FLOWS; SOLVER
AB This study is concerned with predicting surface heat transfer in viscous hypersonic flows using high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods. Currently, finite-volume (FV) schemes are most commonly employed for computing flows in which surface heat transfer is a target quantity; however, these schemes suffer from large sensitivities to a variety of factors, such as the inviscid flux function and the computational mesh. High-order DG methods offer advantages that can mitigate these sensitivities. As such, a simple and robust shock capturing method is developed for DG schemes. The method combines intraelement variations for shock detection with smooth artificial viscosity (AV) for shock stabilization. A parametric study is performed to evaluate the effects of AV on the solution. The shock capturing method is employed to accurately compute double Mach reflection and viscous hypersonic flows over a circular half-cylinder and a double cone, the latter of which involves a complex flow topology with multiple shock interactions and flow separation. Results show this methodology to be significantly less sensitive than FV schemes to mesh topology and inviscid flux function. Furthermore, quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art FV calculations from an error vs. cost perspective are provided. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Local artificial boundary conditions (ABCs) for the numerical simulation of waves have been successfully used for decades (most notably, the boundary conditions due to Engquist & Majda, Bayliss, Gunzburger & Turkel, and Higdon). The basic idea behind these boundary conditions is that they cancel several leading terms in an expansion of the solution. The larger the number of terms canceled, the higher the order of the boundary condition and, in turn, the smaller the reflection error due to truncation of the original unbounded domain by an artificial outer boundary. In practice, however, the use of local ABCs has been limited to low orders (first and second), because higher order boundary conditions involve higher order derivatives of the solution, which may harm well-posedness and cause numerical instabilities. They are also difficult to implement especially in finite elements. A prominent exception is the development of local high order ABCs based on auxiliary variables.
   In the current paper, we implement high order Bayliss-Turkel ABCs directly - with no auxiliary variables yet no discrete approximation of the constituent high order derivatives either. Instead, we represent the solution at the boundary as an expansion with respect to a continuous basis. For the spherical artificial boundary, the basis consists of eigenfunctions of the Beltrami operator (spherical harmonics), which enable replacing the high order derivatives in the ABCs with powers of the corresponding eigenvalues. The continuous representation at the boundary is coupled to higher order compact finite differences inside the domain by the method of difference potentials (MDP). It maintains high order accuracy even when the boundary is not aligned with the discretization grid. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A new approach for solving the electron transport equation in the upper atmosphere is derived. The problem is a very stiff boundary value problem, and to obtain an accurate numerical solution, matrix factorizations are used to decouple the fast and slow modes. A stable finite difference method is applied to each mode. This solver is applied to a simplified problem for which an exact solution exists using various versions of the boundary conditions that might arise in a natural auroral display. The numerical and exact solutions are found to agree with each other, verifying the method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In Euler-Lagrange (EL) simulations the force on each particle is obtained from a point-particle model, which is then coupled back to the fluid momentum. The feedback force modifies the flow at the particle location and it is important to evaluate the resulting self- induced velocity disturbance, since the point-particle models are based on the undisturbed flow. An exact solution of the Oseen's equation for flow generated by a steady Gaussian feedback force was obtained, which along with the corresponding finite Reynolds number numerical simulations, provided a steady model for the self-induced velocity disturbance. The unsteady problem of a time dependent Gaussian feedback force was then theoretically investigated in the zero Reynolds number limit. The corresponding finite Reynolds number unsteady results were obtained using companion numerical simulations. Based on these results an unsteady model for predicting the self-induced velocity disturbance was developed. The two main non-dimensional quantities affecting the self-induced velocity disturbance are the Reynolds number based on Gaussian width Re-sigma and the non-dimensional feedback force (F) over tilde. The resulting self-induced velocity correction model is general and can be applied in a variety of EL point-particle simulations, with the time history of Re-sigma and (F) over tilde as input. The quasi-steady and unsteady versions of the model were tested in the context of a freely settling particle. The unsteady model was shown to predict the self-induced velocity disturbance to reasonable accuracy for a wide range of Reynolds and Stokes numbers. Issues pertaining to practical implementation and limitations are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we analyze a multilevel quasidiffusion (QD) method for solving
   time-dependent multigroup nonlinear radiative transfer problems which describe interaction of photons with matter. The multilevel method is formulated by means of the high-order radiative transfer equation and a set of low-order moment equations. The fully implicit scheme is used to discretize equations in time. The stability analysis is applied to the method in semi-continuous and discretized forms. To perform Fourier analysis, the system of equations of the multilevel method is linearized about an equilibrium solution. The effects of discretization with respect to different independent variables are studied. The multilevel method is shown to be stable and fast converging. We also consider a version of the method in which time evolution in the radiative transfer equation is treated by means of the alpha-approximation. The Fleck-Cummings test problem is used to demonstrate performance of the multilevel QD method and study its iterative stability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A new reduced order model (ROM) provides rapid and reasonably accurate prediction of the complex behavior of multiple, simultaneously growing radial hydraulic fractures. The method entails vastly reducing the degrees of freedom typically associated with fully-coupled simulations of this multiple moving boundary problem by coupling together an approximation of the influence of the stress interaction among the fractures ("stress shadow") with an approximation of fluid flow and elasticity, ensuring preservation of global volume balance, global energy balance, elasticity, and compatibility of the crack opening with the inlet fluid flux. Validating with large scale ("high-fidelity") simulations shows the ROM solution captures not only the basic suppression of interior hydraulic fractures in a uniformly-spaced array due to the well-known stress shadowing phenomenon, but also complex behaviors arising when the spacing among the hydraulic fractures is non-uniform. The simulator's usefulness is demonstrated through a proof-of-concept optimization whereby non-uniform spacing and stage length are chosen to maximize the fracture surface area and/or the uniformity of growth associated with each stimulation treatment.

ID NUMERICAL TREATMENT
AB In cylindrical/spherical geometries, MHD solvers using explicit finite-volume methods face restrictive time steps imposed by the CFL condition due to the clustering of cells in the azimuthal direction near the pole/axis. We use a conservative averaging-reconstruction method (Ring Average) on structured cylindrical/spherical mesh to remove this severe time step restriction for multi-dimensional curvilinear finite-volume MHD solvers. The Ring Average technique is implemented as a post-processing step and thus requires no changes to the existing data structure, grid definition or numerical methods in the original MHD solver. This paper describes the Ring Average algorithm and presents simulation results using field loop advection and MHD blast waves in cylindrical/spherical geometries for validation. The algorithm is shown to be inexpensive and easily implemented in existing curvilinear finite-volume MHD solvers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper focuses on the question of how unconditional stability can be achieved via multistep ImEx schemes, in practice problems where both the implicit and explicit terms are allowed to be stiff. For a class of new ImEx multistep schemes that involve a free parameter, strategies are presented on how to choose the ImEx splitting and the time stepping parameter, so that unconditional stability is achieved under the smallest approximation errors. These strategies are based on recently developed stability concepts, which also provide novel insights into the limitations of existing semi-implicit backward differentiation formulas (SBDF). For instance, the new strategies enable higher order time stepping that is not otherwise possible with SBDF. With specific applications in nonlinear diffusion problems and incompressible channel flows, it is demonstrated how the unconditional stability property can be leveraged to efficiently solve stiff nonlinear or nonlocal problems without the need to solve nonlinear or nonlocal problems implicitly.

AB In this article, well-posedness and dual consistency of the linearized constant coefficient incompressible Navier-Stokes equations posed on time-dependent spatial domains are studied. To simplify the derivation of the dual problem and improve the accuracy of gradients, the second order formulation is transformed to first order form. Boundary conditions that simultaneously lead to boundedness of the primal and dual problems are derived.
   Fully discrete finite difference schemes on summation-by-parts form, in combination with the simultaneous approximation technique, are constructed. We prove energy stability and discrete dual consistency and show how to construct the penalty operators such that the scheme automatically adjusts to the variations of the spatial domain. As a result of the aforementioned formulations, stability and discrete dual consistency follow simultaneously. The method is illustrated by considering a deforming time-dependent spatial domain in two dimensions. The numerical calculations are performed using high order operators in space and time. The results corroborate the stability of the scheme and the accuracy of the solution. We also show that linear functionals are superconverging. Additionally, we investigate the convergence of non-linear functionals and the divergence of the solution. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Staggered grids schemes, formulated in internal energy, are commonly used for CFD applications in industrial context. Here, we prove the consistency of a class of high-order Lagrange-Remap staggered schemes for solving the Euler equations in 1D and 2D on Cartesian grids. The main result of the paper is that using an a posteriori internal energy corrector, the Lagrangian schemes are proved to be conservative in mass, momentum and total energy and to be weakly consistent with the 1D Lagrangian formulation of the Euler equations. Extension in 2D is done using directional splitting methods and face-staggering. Numerical examples in both 1D and 2D illustrate the accuracy, the convergence and the robustness of the schemes.

AB The construction of numerical schemes for the Kuramoto model is challenging due to the structural properties of the system which are essential in order to capture the correct physical behavior, like the description of stationary states and phase transitions. Additional difficulties are represented by the high dimensionality of the problem in presence of multiple frequencies. In this paper, we develop numerical methods which are capable to preserve these structural properties of the Kuramoto equation in the presence of diffusion and to solve efficiently the multiple frequencies case. The novel schemes are then used to numerically investigate the phase transitions in the case of identical and nonidentical oscillators. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The aim of this paper is to present a new efficient and accurate semi-implicit finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method for modeling thin plasmonic metamaterials supporting spoof surface plasmons. The presented method is formulated by combining Yu-Mittra's conformal FDTD technique for dielectrics, the simplified conformal finite integration technique for perfectly electric conductors (PECs) and the Newmark-Beta method. The resultant scheme is magnetically implicit, has a more relaxed stability condition than that of Yee's FDTD scheme, and allows for accurate modeling of both PEC and dielectric curved surfaces. Energy conservation and stability of the presented scheme is theoretically proved with the energy inequality method. Its formulation can be generalized to a class of magnetically implicit FDTD schemes with weakly conditional and unconditional stability in a unified manner. The presented scheme is used to simulate thin structures supporting spoof surface plasmon polaritons and spoof localized surface plasmons, and also applied to recent plasmonic devices such as planar frequency splitter, ultrathin rainbow trapping device and compact planar metadisk with split-ring resonators. The accuracy and efficiency of the presented scheme are assessed in comparison with the conventional explicit and implicit FDTD methods, and their conformal variants. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB We present an effective harmonic density interpolation method for the numerical evaluation of singular and nearly singular Laplace boundary integral operators and layer potentials in two and three spatial dimensions. The method relies on the use of Green's third identity and local Taylor-like interpolations of density functions in terms of harmonic polynomials. The proposed technique effectively regularizes the singularities present in boundary integral operators and layer potentials, and recasts the latter in terms of integrands that are bounded or even more regular, depending on the order of the density interpolation. The resulting boundary integrals can then be easily, accurately, and inexpensively evaluated by means of standard quadrature rules. A variety of numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique when used in conjunction with the classical trapezoidal rule (to integrate over smooth curves) in two-dimensions, and with a Chebyshev-type quadrature rule (to integrate over surfaces given as unions of non-overlapping quadrilateral patches) in three-dimensions.

AB Efficient time integration schemes are necessary to capture the complex processes involved in atmospheric flows over long periods of time. In this work, we propose a high-order, implicit-explicit numerical scheme that combines Multi-Level Spectral Deferred Corrections (MLSDC) and the Spherical Harmonics (SH) transform to solve the wave-propagation problems arising from the shallow-water equations on the rotating sphere.
   The iterative temporal integration is based on a sequence of corrections distributed on coupled space-time levels to perform a significant portion of the calculations on a coarse representation of the problem and hence to reduce the time-to-solution while preserving accuracy. In our scheme, referred to as MLSDC-SH, the spatial discretization plays a key role in the efficiency of MLSDC, since the SH basis allows for consistent transfer functions between space-time levels that preserve important physical properties of the solution.
   We study the performance of the MLSDC-SH scheme with shallow-water test cases commonly used in numerical atmospheric modeling. We use this suite of test cases, which gradually adds more complexity to the nonlinear system of governing partial differential equations, to perform a detailed analysis of the accuracy of MLSDC-SH upon refinement in time. We illustrate the stability properties of MLSDC-SH and show that the proposed scheme achieves up to eighth-order convergence in time. Finally, we study the conditions in which MLSDC-SH achieves its theoretical speedup, and we show that it can significantly reduce the computational cost compared to single-level Spectral Deferred Corrections (SDC).

AB This paper presents an analysis of refinement indicators for the simulation of steady and unsteady flows by means of p-adaptive algorithms for discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods. Residual-error, discretization-error and feature-based indicators are compared by studying their effect on convergence history, computational gain and refinement regions selected by the adaptive algorithm. The analysis is initially carried out on steady flow configurations. Static p-adaptive simulations of the periodic flow past a cylinder at Re = 100 are then performed. Compared to uniform p-refinement, a reduction between 50% and 75% in the number of degrees of freedom is obtained for all test cases considered. The accuracy and efficiency observed for the small-scale energy density [1] and spectral decay [2] indicators demonstrate their great potential for the adaptive simulation of unsteady flows.

AB The high-order flux reconstruction (FR) method on unstructured hexahedral grids is coupled with the localized artificial diffusivity (LAD) scheme for aiming at accurate simulation of shock-turbulence interaction. In order to overcome known robustness issues particularly with the high-order (r > 0) derivative formulation, important properties of the artificial bulk viscosity (ABV) profile affecting the solution are investigated first. For the purpose of comparison, an approximated Gaussian filter and modified restriction-prolongation (RP) filters are developed and tested for the present FR-LAD approach. Then, we propose a multidimensional RP filter on unstructured quadrilateral and hexahedral grids to address the issues on non-Cartesian grids. It is shown that a simple extension of a one-dimensional RP filter for two-dimensional grids may result in insufficient smoothing of ABV with r = 2, and that the proposed multidimensional RP filter can provide smooth ABV with both r = 0 and r = 2. The proposed FR-LAD scheme is tested for typical shock-related problems, including the 1D shock tube, 1D shock-entropy wave interaction, 2D steady shock flows, and 2D shock-vortex interaction. The FR-LAD scheme has favorable properties of subcell shock capturing with the length scale of O(h/p) and superior preservation of high-order accuracy for smooth flows. Finally, LES of an overexpanded supersonic jet is performed to demonstrate its capability for practical applications. The proposed FR-LAD scheme can be an attractive candidate for LES or DNS of compressible flows involving shocks, contact discontinuities, turbulence, and their interactions on unstructured meshes.

   SOLUTION
AB Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation has become a routine design tool for i) predicting accurately the thermal performances of electronics set ups and devices such as cooling system and ii) optimizing configurations. Although CFD simulations using discretization methods such as finite volume or finite element can be performed at different scales, from component/board levels to larger system, these classical discretization techniques can prove to be too costly and time consuming, especially in the case of optimization purposes where similar systems, with different design parameters have to be solved sequentially. The design parameters can be of geometric nature or related to the boundary conditions. This motivates our interest on model reduction and particularly on reduced basis methods. As is well documented in the literature, the offline/online implementation of the standard RB method (a Galerkin approach within the reduced basis space) requires to modify the original CFD calculation code, which for a commercial one may be problematic even impossible. For this reason, we have proposed in a previous paper, with an application to a simple scalar convection diffusion problem, an alternative non-intrusive reduced basis approach (NIRB) based on a two-grid finite element discretization. Here also the process is two stages: offiine, the construction of the reduced basis is performed on a fine mesh; online a new configuration is simulated using a coarse mesh. While such a coarse solution, can be computed quickly enough to be used in a rapid decision process, it is generally not accurate enough for practical use. In order to retrieve accuracy, we first project every such coarse solution into the reduced space, and then further improve them via a rectification technique. The purpose of this paper is to generalize the approach to a CFD configuration. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we study the bipolar Boltzmann-Poisson model, both for the deterministic system and the system with uncertainties, with asymptotic behavior leading to the drift diffusion-Poisson system as the Knudsen number goes to zero. The random inputs can arise from collision kernels, doping profile and initial data. We adopt a generalized polynomial chaos approach based stochastic Galerkin (gPC-SG) method. Sensitivity analysis is conducted using hypocoercivity theory for both the analytical solution and the gPC solution for a simpler model that ignores the electric field, and it gives their convergence toward the global Maxwellian exponentially in time. A formal proof of the stochastic asymptotic-preserving (s-AP) property and a uniform spectral convergence with error decaying exponentially in time in the random space of the scheme is given. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the accuracy, efficiency and asymptotic properties of the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, our aim is to present (1) an embedded fracture model (EFM) for coupled flow and mechanics problem based on the dual continuum approach on the fine grid and (2) an upscaled model for the resulting fine grid equations. The mathematical model is described by the coupled system of equation for displacement, fracture and matrix pressures. For a fine grid approximation, we use the finite volume method for flow problem and finite element method for mechanics. Due to the complexity of fractures, solutions have a variety of scales, and fine grid approximation results in a large discrete system. Our second focus in the construction of the upscaled coarse grid poroelasticity model for fractured media. Our upscaled approach is based on the nonlocal multicontinuum (NLMC) upscaling for coupled flow and mechanics problem, which involves computations of local basis functions via an energy minimization principle. This concept allows a systematic upscaling for processes in the fractured porous media, and provides an effective coarse scale model whose degrees of freedoms have physical meaning. We obtain a fast and accurate solver for the poroelasticity problem on a coarse grid and, at the same time, derive a novel upscaled model. We present numerical results for the two dimensional model problem. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Simulations of fluid flow in naturally fractured rocks have implications for several subsurface applications, including energy storage and extraction, and waste disposal. We are interested in flow in discrete fracture networks, which explicitly represent flow in fracture surfaces, but ignore the impact of the surrounding host rock. Fracture networks, generated from observations or stochastic simulations, will contain intersections of arbitrary length, and intersection lines can further cross, forming a highly complex geometry. As the flow exchange between fractures, thus in the network, takes place in these intersections, an adequate representation of the geometry is critical for simulation accuracy. In practice, the intersection dynamics must be handled by a combination of the simulation grid, which may or may not resolve the intersection lines, and the numerical methods applied on the grid. In this work, we review different classes of numerical approaches proposed in recent years, covering both methods that conform to the grid, and non-matching cases. Specific methods considered herein include finite elements, mixed and virtual elements and control volume methods. We expose our methods to an extensive set of test cases, ranging from artificial geometries designed to test difficult configurations, to a network extruded from a real fracture outcrop. The main outcome is guidances for choice of simulation models and numerical discretization with a trade off on the computational cost and solution accuracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB In recent years, several fast solvers for the solution of the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation that mathematically models the scattering of time-harmonic acoustic waves by penetrable inhomogeneous obstacles, have been proposed. While many of these fast methodologies exhibit rapid convergence for smoothly varying scattering configurations, the rate for most of them reduce to either linear or quadratic when material properties are allowed to jump across the interface. A notable exception to this is a recently introduced Nystrom scheme (Anand et al., 2016 [22]) that utilizes a specialized quadrature in the boundary region for a high-order treatment of the material interface. In this text, we present a solution framework that relies on the specialized boundary integrator to enhance the convergence rate of other fast, low order methodologies without adding to their computational complexity of O (N log N) for an N-point discretization. In particular, to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, we explain its implementation to enhance the order to convergence of two schemes, one introduced by Duan and Rokhlin (2009) [13] that is based on a pre-corrected trapezoidal rule while the other by Bruno and Hyde (2004) [12] which relies on a suitable decomposition of the Green's function via Addition theorem. In addition to a detailed description of these methodologies, we also present a comparative performance study of the improved versions of these two and the Nystrom solver in Anand et al. (2016) [22] through a wide range of numerical experiments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we investigate the use of higher-order exponential Rosenbrock time integration methods for the shallow water equations on the sphere. This stiff, nonlinear model provides a 'testing ground' for accurate and stable time integration methods in weather modeling, serving as the focus for exploration of novel methods for many years. We therefore identify a candidate set of three recent exponential Rosenbrock methods of orders four and five (exprb42, pexprb43 and exprb53) for use in this model. Based on their multi-stage structure, we propose a set of modifications to the phipm/IOM2 algorithm for efficiently calculating the matrix functions phi(k). We then investigate the performance of these methods on a suite of four challenging test problems, comparing them against the epi3 method investigated previously in [1,2] on these problems. In all cases, the proposed methods enable accurate solutions at much longer time-steps than epi3, proving considerably more efficient as either the desired solution error decreases, or as the test problem nonlinearity increases.

AB A weakly compressible scheme for gas-liquid two-phase flows with low Mach number is proposed for a fully-explicit time integration. The scheme is based on the fractional-step method with the Euler equation solver and time integration for viscous, surface tension and gravity terms. For the efficient solution of the Euler equation, we introduce the directional-splitting method and the method of characteristics which is applicable to semi-Lagrangian methods. A reduction of the speed of sound is also taken into consideration to enlarge the time step intervals. The primitive flow variables are time-integrated on the node-center configuration. To capture the gas-liquid interface, the conservative phase-field equation is solved by using the multi-moment method. It is computed as a conservative form for the volume-averaged value defined at the cell center, in which the flow velocities are given on the node. We discard the exact momentum conservation, however the total mass of gas and liquid is conserved by introducing a phase-field variable. Several benchmark problems are examined and the results of the explicit scheme are in good agreement with the experimental and computational references. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI A general framework for the evaluation of shock-capturing schemes
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS

DT Article
DE Shock capturing schemes; Computational efficiency; Wave propagation
ID FINITE-DIFFERENCE SCHEMES; HIGH-ORDER; SIMULATION
AB We introduce a standardized procedure for benchmarking shock-capturing schemes which is intended to go beyond traditional case-by-case analysis, by setting objective metrics for cross-comparison of flow solvers. The main idea is that use of shock-capturing schemes yields both distributed errors associated with propagation of wave-like disturbances in smooth flow regions, and localized errors at shocks where nonlinear numerical mechanisms are most active. Our standardized error evaluation framework relies on previous methods of analysis for the propagation error with associated cost/error mapping, and on novel analysis of the shock-capturing error based on a model scalar problem. Amplitude and phase errors are identified for a number of classical shock-capturing schemes with different order of accuracy. Whereas all schemes are found to be, as expected, first-order accurate at shocks, quantitative differences are found to be significant, and we find that certain schemes in wide use (e.g. high-order WENO schemes) may yield substantial over-amplification of incoming disturbances at shocks. Illustrative calculations are also shown for the 1D Euler equations, which support sufficient generality of the analysis, although nonlinearity suggests caution in straightforward extrapolation to other flow cases.

AB The purpose of the present paper is to compare two semi-Lagrangian methods in the context of the four-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson equation. More specifically, our goal is to compare the performance of the more recently developed semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin scheme to cubic spline interpolation, which is widely used in Eulerian Vlasov simulation. To that end, we perform simulations for nonlinear Landau damping and a two-stream instability and provide benchmarks for the SeLaLib and SLDG codes, both on a workstation and using MPI on a cluster. In addition, we will present results for the graphic processing unit (GPU) implementation contained in SLDG.
   We find that the semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin scheme shows a moderate improvement in run time for nonlinear Landau damping and a substantial improvement for the two-stream instability. It should be emphasized that these results are markedly different from results obtained in the asymptotic regime, which favor spline interpolation. Thus, we conclude that the traditional approach of evaluating numerical methods is misleading, even for short time simulations. In addition, the absence of any global communication in the semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin method gives it a decisive advantage for scaling to more than 256 cores. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB A thorough variational multiscale (VMS) modeling of the Navier-Stokes equations is used to compute numerical solutions of the incompressible flow over an open cavity. This case features several competing instabilities, and is highly challenging for VMS methods with regard to frequency and pattern selection, because of the non-normality of the linearized Navier-Stokes operator. The relevance of the approach is thus carefully assessed by comparing to direct numerical simulation (DNS) data benchmarked at several Reynolds numbers, and highly accurate time advancing methods are shown to predict relevant evolutions of the transient and saturated solutions. The VMS reduces substantially the computational cost, by similar to 35% (resp. similar to 60%) in terms of CPU time using a semi-implicit discretization scheme based on backward differentiation formula (resp. the implicit Crank-Nicholson scheme), and by similar to 80% in terms of memory requirement. Eventually, the highly efficient semi-implicit VMS numerical framework is used to unravel the onset of the flow oscillations and the selection of the limit cycle frequency, that happens to involve a subcritical Neimark-Sacker bifurcation.

DE Discrete systems; Model-order reduction; Multi-fidelity models;
   Parameter estimation; Surrogate modeling
AB In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for the construction of multi-fidelity surrogate models with "discrete" fidelity levels. The notion of a discrete level of fidelity is in contrast to a mathematical model, for which the notion of refinement towards a high-fidelity model is relevant to sending a discretization parameter toward zero in a continuous way. Our notion of discrete fidelity levels encompasses cases for which there is no notion of convergence in terms of a fidelity parameter that can be sent to zero or infinity. The particular choice of how levels of fidelity are defined in this framework paves the way for using models that may have no apparent physical or mathematical relationship to the target high-fidelity model. However, our approach requires that models can produce results with a common set of parameters in the target model. Hence, fidelity level in this work is not directly representative of the degree of similarity of a low-fidelity model to a target high-fidelity model. In particular, we show that our approach is applicable to competitive ecological systems with different numbers of species, discrete-state Markov chains with a different number of states, polymer networks with a different number of connections, and nano-particle plasmonic arrays with a different number of scatterers. The results of this study demonstrate that our procedure boasts computational efficiency and accuracy for a wide variety of models and engineering systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a goal-oriented error analysis for the calculation of low Reynolds steady compressible flows with anisotropic mesh adaptation. The error analysis is of a priori type. Its central principle is to express the right-hand side of the error equation, often referred as the local error, as a function of the interpolation error of a collection of fields present in the nonlinear Partial Differential Equations. This goal-oriented error analysis is the extension of [39] done for inviscid flows to laminar viscous flows by adding viscous terms. The main benefits of this approach, in comparison to other error estimates in the literature, is that the optimal anisotropy of the mesh directly appears in the error analysis and is not obtained from an ad hoc variable nor a local analysis. As a consequence, an optimum is obtained and the convergence of the mesh adaptive process is very fast, Le., generally the convergence is obtained after 5 to 10 mesh adaptation cycle. Then, using the continuous mesh framework, an optimal metric is analytically obtained from the error estimation. Applications to mesh adaptive calculations of flows past airfoils are presented.

AB This paper develops appropriate boundary conditions for the two-sided fractional diffusion equation, where the usual second derivative in space is replaced by a weighted average of positive (left) and negative (right) fractional derivatives. Mass preserving, reflecting boundary conditions for two-sided fractional diffusion involve a balance of left and right fractional derivatives at the boundary. Stable, consistent explicit and implicit Euler methods are detailed, and steady state solutions are derived. Steady state solutions for two-sided fractional diffusion equations using both Riemann-Liouville and Caputo flux are computed. For Riemann-Liouville flux and reflecting boundary conditions, the steady-state solution is singular at one or both of the end-points. For Caputo flux and reflecting boundary conditions, the steady-state solution is a constant function. Numerical experiments illustrate the convergence of these numerical methods. Finally, the influence of the reflecting boundary on the steady-state behavior subject to both the Riemann-Liouville and Caputo fluxes is discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The time-dependent equations of computational electrodynamics (CED) are evolved consistent with the divergence constraints on the electric displacement and magnetic induction vector fields. Respecting these constraints has proved to be very useful in the classic finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) schemes. As a result, there has been a recent effort to design finite volume time domain (FVTD) and discontinuous Galerkin time domain (DGTD) schemes that satisfy the same constraints and, nevertheless, draw on recent advances in higher order Godunov methods. This paper catalogues the first step in the design of globally constraint-preserving DGTD schemes. The algorithms presented here are based on a novel DG-like method that is applied to a Yee-type staggering of the electromagnetic field variables in the faces of the mesh. The other two novel building blocks of the method include constraint-preserving reconstruction of the electromagnetic fields and multidimensional Riemann solvers; both of which have been developed in recent years by the first author.
   The resulting DGTD scheme is linear, at least when limiters are not applied to the DG scheme. As a result, it is possible to carry out a von Neumann stability analysis of the entire suite of DGTD schemes for CED at orders of accuracy ranging from second to fourth. The analysis requires some simplifications in order to make it analytically tractable, however, it proves to be extremely instructive. A von Neumann stability analysis is a necessary precursor to the design of a full DGTD scheme for CED. It gives us the maximal CFL numbers that can be sustained by the DGTD schemes presented here at all orders. It also enables us to understand the wave propagation characteristics of the schemes in various directions on a Cartesian mesh. We find that constraint-preserving DGTD schemes permit CFL numbers that are competitive with conventional DG schemes. However, like conventional DG schemes, the CFL of DGTD schemes decreases with increasing order. To counteract that, we also present constraint-preserving PNPM schemes for CED. We find that the third and fourth order constraint-preserving DGTD and P1PM schemes have some extremely attractive properties when it comes to low-dispersion, low-dissipation propagation of electromagnetic waves in multidimensions. Numerical accuracy tests are also provided to support the von Neumann stability analysis. We expect these methods to play a role in those problems of engineering CED where exceptional precision must be achieved at any cost. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present two finite volume schemes to solve a class of Poisson-type equations subject to Robin boundary conditions in irregular domains with piecewise smooth boundaries. The first scheme results in a symmetric linear system and produces second-order accurate numerical solutions with first-order accurate gradients in the L-infinity-norm (for solutions with two bounded derivatives). The second scheme is nonsymmetric but produces second-order accurate numerical solutions as well as second-order accurate gradients in the L-infinity-norm (for solutions with three bounded derivatives). Numerical examples are given in two and three spatial dimensions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID SPURIOUS SOLUTIONS; EQUATION; ORIGIN
AB In this work we will treat the spurious eigenvalues obstacle that appears in the computation of the radial Dirac eigenvalue problem using numerical methods. The treatment of the spurious solution is based on applying Petrov-Galerkin finite element method. The significance of this work is the employment of just continuous basis functions, thus the need of a continuous function which has a continuous first derivative as a basis, as in [2,3], is no longer required. The Petrov-Galerkin finite element method for the Dirac eigenvalue problem strongly depends on a stability parameter, tau, that controls the size of the diffusion terms added to the finite element formulation for the problem. The mesh-dependent parameter tau is derived based on the given problem with the particular basis functions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a Calderon preconditioner for the electric field integral equation (EFIE), which does not require a barycentric refinement of the mesh and which yields a Hermitian, positive definite (HPD) system matrix allowing for the usage of the conjugate gradient (CG) solver. The resulting discrete equation system is immune to the low-frequency and the dense-discretization breakdown and, in contrast to existing Calderon preconditioners, no second discretization of the EFIE operator with Buffa-Christiansen (BC) functions is necessary. This preconditioner is obtained by leveraging on spectral equivalences between (scalar) integral operators, namely the single layer and the hypersingular operator known from electrostatics, on the one hand, and the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the other hand. Since our approach incorporates Helmholtz projectors, there is no search for global loops necessary and thus our method remains stable on multiply connected geometries. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for both canonical and realistic (multi-scale) problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The second moment specification of the random coefficients of these representations are enhanced to full probabilistic characterization by using translation, polynomial chaos, and translated polynomial chaos models, referred to as T, PC, and PCT models. Following theoretical considerations on KL representations and T, PC, and PCT models, three numerical examples are presented to illustrate the implementation and performance of these models. The PCT models inherit the desirable features of both T and PC models. It approximates accurately all quantities of interest considered in these examples. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We provide a careful Fourier analysis of the Guermond-Pasquetti mass lumping correction technique (Guermond and Pasquetti, 2013 [11]) applied to pure transport and convection-diffusion problems. In particular, it is found that increasing the number of corrections reduces the accuracy for problems with diffusion; however all the corrected schemes are more accurate than the consistent Galerkin formulation in this case. For the pure transport problems the situation is the opposite. We also investigate the differences between two numerical solutions - the consistent solution and the corrected ones, and show that increasing the number of corrections makes solutions of the corrected schemes closer to the consistent solution in all cases.

AB In this work, we propose and test the validity of a modified Phase Field Method (PFM), which is specifically developed for large scale simulations of turbulent flows with large and deformable surfactant-laden droplets. The time evolution of the phase field, phi, and of the surfactant concentration field, psi, are obtained from two Cahn-Hilliard-like equations together with a two-order-parameter Time-Dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) free energy functional. The modifications introduced circumvent existing limitations of current approaches based on PFM and improve the well-posedness of the model. The effect of surfactant on surface tension is modeled via an Equation Of State (EOS), further improving the flexibility of the approach. This method can efficiently handle topological changes, i.e. breakup and coalescence, and describe adsorption/desorption of surfactant. The capabilities of the proposed approach are tested in this paper against previous experimental results on the effects of surfactant on the deformation of a single droplet and on the interactions between two droplets. Finally, to appreciate the performances of the model on a large scale complex simulation, a qualitative analysis of the behavior of surfactant-laden droplets in a turbulent channel flow is presented and discussed.

AB The evaluation of subjective data is a very demanding task. The classification of the information gathered from human evaluators and the possible high noise levels introduced are ones of the most difficult issues to deal with. This situation leads to adopt individuals who can be considered as experts in the specific application domain. Thus, the development of Expert Systems (ES) that consider the opinion of these individuals have been appeared to mitigate the problem. In this work an original methodology for the selection of subjective sequential data for the training of ES is presented. The system is based on the arrangement of knowledge acquired from a group of human experts. An original similarity measure between the subjective evaluations is proposed. Homogeneous groups of experts are produced using this similarity through a clustering algorithm. The methodology was applied to a practical case of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) domain for the training of ES for driving risk prediction. The results confirm the relevance of selecting homogeneous information (grouping similar opinions) when generating a ground truth (a reliable signal) for the training of ES. Further, the results show the need of considering subjective sequential data when working with phenomena where a set of rules could not be easily learned from human experts, such as risk assessment.

AB Survival analysis has been developed and applied in the number of areas including manufacturing, finance, economics and healthcare. In healthcare domain, usually clinical data are high-dimensional, sparse and complex and sometimes there exists few amount of time-to-event (labeled) instances. Therefore building an accurate survival model from electronic health records is challenging. With this motivation, we address this issue and provide a new survival analysis framework using deep learning and active learning with a novel sampling strategy. First, our approach provides better representation with lower dimensions from clinical features using labeled (time-to-event) and unlabeled (censored) instances and then actively trains the survival model by labeling the censored data using an oracle. As a clinical assistive tool, we introduce a simple effective treatment recommendation approach based on our survival model. In the experimental study, we apply our approach on SEER-Medicare data related to prostate cancer among African-Americans and white patients. The results indicate that our approach outperforms significantly than baseline models. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the further development of marine and information technologies, ship intelligence, green policies and automation will become mainstream with global cargo ships. Ship labor costs increase every year, so for the foreseeable future, the number of experienced crew members will be greatly reduced as smart ship emergence accelerates. At present, there is no mature research system for the human-like piloting of smart ships. In this paper, we use an improved decision tree, which could address problems of fuzziness and uncertainty. This will allow us to study the decision mechanisms of different piloting behaviors in order to realize the automatic acquisition and representation of the pilot's decision-making knowledge in inbound ship analysis as well as the simulated reproduction of the pilot's behavior. The simulation results show that the piloting decision recognition model, based on the fuzzy Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3) decision tree, possesses a high reasoning speed and can accurately identify current piloting behavior. This provides theoretical guidance and a feasibility basis for research into human-like piloting behavior and the realization of automatic smart ship piloting systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Optimization problems have attracted attention of researchers for decades. Commonly, problem related data and problem domain are assumed to be exactly known beforehand and to remain stationary. However, numerous real life optimization problems are dynamic. In practice, unpredictable events like due date changes, arrivals of new jobs or cancellations yield to changes in parameters, constraints or variables. In addition to the challenges of traditional stationary optimization problems, diverse parts of the problem space should also be monitored to keep track of moving optima in dynamic problems. Therefore, dividing a population (swarm) into smaller sized sub-swarms is a promising strategy particularly for multi-modal problems. In this context, the present work extends Firefly Algorithm (FA) as a multi population based algorithm to solve multi-modal dynamic optimization problems due to its popularity and demonstrated competitive performance. Quantum particles are employed to monitor the neighborhoods of the best solutions of each sub-swarm in order to overcome the loss of diversity problem. Quantum strategy is also used to respond to dynamic events. Moreover, economical FA along with a simpler move function is introduced in order to consume fitness evaluations more efficiently. Most of the previous approaches ignore prioritizing sub-swarms which can be advantageous. For example, sub-swarms can either be evolved sequentially, randomly or they can be prioritized via some learning-based techniques. Thus, more promising regions might be discovered at earlier evaluations. In this context, the proposed FA extension is further enhanced with such prioritizing strategies, which are based on the feedback from sub-swarms. The experiments are conducted on the well-known Moving Peaks Benchmark along with comparisons with well-known methods. The proposed FA is found as promising and competitive according to the outcomes of the comprehensive experimental study. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Described for the first time is the use of elemental analysis of diabetic toenails and machine learning techniques for the robust classification of type-2 diabetes. Aluminum, Cs, Ni, V and Zn concentrations in toenails were found to be significantly (p < 0.05) different between healthy volunteers and type-2 diabetes patients. Seven different machine learning algorithms were then studied to develop a non-invasive diagnostic method using concentrations of twenty-two elements in toenails, and personal information such as age, gender and smoking history as features. Models were enhanced through feature selection and two different ensembling strategies. The performance of forty-six distinct machine learning models were compared on resampled training data and testing data. A random forest model, trained with concentrations of Al, Ba, Ca, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, S, Sb, Se, Sn, Sr, V and Zn (mu g g(-1)), as well as information on age, gender and smoking history, had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.73 on the training data, and correctly predicted seven out of nine test samples (including control and disease), with an AUC of 0.90. The results at this stage of the research prove the concept of combining elemental analysis of toenails and machine learning techniques for non-invasively diagnosing type-2 diabetes. With proper sample collection and shipping, mobility-limited patients may be able to mail toenail samples for analysis and monitor their type-2 diabetes over time. A health clinic equipped with common instrumentation, software and trained algorithms similar to those used in the present study may be able to serve a large number of patients from across the world.

AB In the last two decades, the text summarization task has gained much importance because of the large amount of online data, and its potential to extract useful information and knowledge in a way that could be easily handled by humans and used for a myriad of purposes, including expert systems for text assessment. This paper presents an automatic process for text assessment that relies on fuzzy rules on a variety of extracted features to find the most important information in the assessed texts. The automatically produced summaries of these texts are compared with reference summaries created by domain experts. Differently from other proposals in the literature, our method summarizes text by investigating correlated features to reduce dimensionality, and consequently the number of fuzzy rules used for text summarization. Thus, the proposed approach for text summarization with a relatively small number of fuzzy rules can benefit development and use of future expert systems able to automatically assess writing. The proposed summarization method has been trained and tested in experiments using a dataset of Brazilian Portuguese texts provided by students in response to tasks assigned to them in a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). The proposed approach was compared with other methods including a naive baseline, Score, Model and Sentence, using ROUGE measures. The results show that the proposal provides better f-measure (with 95% CI) than aforementioned methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved

AB In this paper, we propose and compare alternative ways to merge plans formed of sequences of actions with unknown similarities between the goals and actions. Plans are formed of actions and are executed by several operator agents, which cooperate through recommendations. The operator agents apply the plan actions to passive elements (which we call node agents) that will require additional future executions of other plans after some time. The ignorance of the similarities between the plan actions and the goals justifies the use of a distributed recommendation system to produce a useful plan for a given operator agent to apply towards a certain goal. This plan is generated from the known results of previous executions of various plans by other operator agents. Here, we present the general framework of execution (the agent system) and the results of applying various merging algorithms to this problem. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper suggests a novel method to deal with target setting in mergers using goal programming (GP) and inverse data envelopment analysis (InvDEA). A conventional DEA model obtains the relative efficiency of decision making units (DMUs) given multiple inputs and multiple outputs for each DMU. However, the InvDEA aims to identify the quantities of inputs and outputs when efficiency score is given as a target. This study provides an effective method that allows decision makers to incorporate their preference in target setting of a merger for saving specific input(s) or producing certain output(s) as much as possible. The proposed method is validated through an illustrative application in banking industry. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID REPRESENTATION
AB Verbalized text contains knowledge necessary and sufficient for transfer of numerous human cognitions. The question is how this knowledge was saved into text. Authors believe that they found an important idea how to assemble knowledge into nodes of knowledge. Similar methods in the field of knowledge networks exist, but none of them does it in the same way as the Node of Knowledge (NOK) method. Basic terms and concepts in a language are represented in words whose meaning is final and cannot be divided in subterms. More complex meaning can be achieved by combining words in sentences. According to authors' opinion, each sentence includes connective medium for words in the sentence (related to semantic reasons), which is inwrought in the Node of Knowledge method. Using the Node of Knowledge method each sentence can be presented as a network of connected words. This network is enriched with links between words so a computer can interpret meaning and knowledge of the sentence in the same way an intelligent person does. A formalized and semantically enriched record of sentences (called Formalized Node of Knowledge- FNOK) is developed. Authors find that in this way, even without statistical text analysis, an algorithm can give correct answer to a question set based on written text. This paper presents the system for transformation of textual knowledge expressed in natural language sentences into a relational database. The system is a part of a larger knowledge-based system based on the Node of Knowledge (NOK) conceptual framework for knowledge-based system development. This paper starts with sentences written in the formalized and enriched form for which a logical transformation into the structure of a relational database is proposed. The system-and algorithms for the transformation of formalized sentences into n-tuples of the relational database are distributed and represented in several steps. The research has shown that it is possible to store semantically enriched sentences in relational databases. The solution presented in this paper is important for further development of the system for receiving questions from users and providing answers (i.e. question-answering system), with the ability to use well-developed relational SQL languages. Relational database of texts enables numerous applications in the field of expert and intelligent systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancer types in the world, which causes many people to lose their lives. Cancer research is of importance since early diagnosis of cancer facilitates clinical applications for patients. The aim of the study is the automatic diagnosis of cervical cancer. For this purpose, a data set containing 668 samples, 30 attributes and 4 target variables (Schiller, Citology, Biopsy and Hinselmann) from the UCI database was used in the training and testing phases. Softmax classification with stacked autoencoder, one of the deep learning methods, has been used to classify data sets. At first, by applying stacked autoencoder to the raw data set, a reduced dimension dataset is obtained. This data set has been trained for classification by applying the softmax layer. In this phase, 70% (468) of the data set was allocated for training and the remaining 30% (200) for testing. In order to compare the classification performance of the softmax classification with stacked autoencoder, decision tree, kNN, SVM, Feed Forward NN, Rotation Forest models, which are machine learning methods, are used. In the study, proposed models were applied separately to 4 target variables of the dataset, and their classification successes were compared. Finally, softmax classification with stacked autoencoder model, which was applied for the first time in the cervical cancer dataset, performed better than the other machine learning methods with a correct classification rate of 97.8%. Given the interest in machine learning methods in cancer research, new methods of diagnosis are presented in this study in terms of patient diagnostic support systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

   point detectors; Visual vocabulary
ID CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES; TEXTURE
AB Automatic and reliable classification of images of white blood cells is desirable for inexpensive, quick and accurate health diagnosis worldwide. In contrast to previous approaches which tend to rely on image segmentation and a careful choice of ad hoc (geometric) features, we explore the possibilities of local image descriptors, since they are a simple approach, they require no explicit segmentation, and yet they have been shown to be quite robust against background distraction in a number of visual tasks. Despite its potential, this methodology remains unexplored for this problem. In this work, images are therefore characterized with the well-known visual bag-of-words approach. Three keypoint detectors and five regular sampling strategies are studied and compared.
   The results indicate that the approach is encouraging, and that both the sparse keypoint detectors and the dense regular sampling strategies can perform reasonably well (mean accuracies of about 80% are obtained), and are competitive to segmentation-based approaches. Two of the main findings are as follows. First, for sparse points, the detector which localizes keypoints on the cell contour (oFAST) performs somehow better than the other two (SIFT and CenSurE). Second, interestingly, and partly contrary to our expectations, the regular sampling strategies including hierarchical spatial information, multi-resolution encoding, or foveal-like sampling, clearly outperform the two simpler uniform-sampling strategies considered.
   From the broader perspective of expert and intelligent systems, the relevance of the proposed approach is that, since it is very general and problem-agnostic, it makes unnecessary human expertise to be elicited in the form of explicit visual cues; only the labels of the cell type are required from human domain experts.

Comparison with the conventional quenched and tempered (QT) specimen, the remarkable improvement of impact toughness (similar to 87 J) and fracture toughness (similar to 39 MPa.m(1/2)) were achieved in 30% prior cold deformed specimen, while with a slight decrease in the hardness. The enhanced toughness was attributed to the nanometric martensite-bainite duplex microstructures and the formation of film-like retained austenite. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, non-isothermal crystallization behavior of polyethylene glycol (PEG)/expanded vermiculite (EVM) form-stable composite phase change material (PEG-EVM) was investigated. The activation energy of non-isothermal crystallization of PEG-EVM (-219.7 kJ/mol) was lower than that of PEG (-375.3 kJ/mol), indicating that the energy barrier of heterogeneous nucleation decreased, demonstrating that the EVM significantly accelerated the nucleation of PEG. However, the crystallization kinetic parameters (half-crystallization time, crystallization rate and required cooling rate for a designated relative crystallinity) revealed that the non-isothermal crystalline growth of PEG in PEG-EVM was constrained because the surface interactions of EVM hindered the migration and diffusion of PEG molecular chains to the surface of nucleus.

AB Diamond, a wide band gap semiconductor material, has been attracting interest in several fields from electrics and optics to biomedicine and quantum computing due to its outstanding properties. These properties of diamond are related to its unique lattice and optically active defect centers. In this paper, we present a detailed study of the temperature-dependent linewidth and energy shift for two zero-phonon lines at 503.5 nm (3H center) and 741 nm (GR1 center). We also discuss the uses and properties of electron-photon coupling and zero-phonon lines. The results show that with the increasing temperature, both centers red-shifted and broadened, and the intrinsic defects of the GR1 center were mainly controlled by the homogeneous broadening mechanism, while the inhomogeneous broadening mechanism of the 3H center was probably caused by local stress.

AB Early hydration and microstructure of gypsum plaster (G) paste in different compositions and hydration time were studied by environment scanning electron microscope (ESEM) coupled with liquid nitrogen cooling. It was observed that small hemihydrate particles rapidly dissolved and hydrated, forming dihydrate crystals network around large hemihydrate particles, which makes an increasingly dense microstructure and promotes the setting of G paste. Besides, different chemical admixtures such as polycarboxylate (PC), hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) and starch ether (SE) would promote the flocculating or deflocculating between particles and therefore modify the fluidity of the paste. This work paves the way to the understanding the setting and rheology of hydraulic materials in the perspective of microstructure evolution. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two Ta-2.5W alloy sheets were cold-rolled to 1 mm and 0.5 mm thick and their plastic strain ratio (r values) were evaluated by tensile tests. The 0.5 mm sheet, comparing with the 1 mm sheet, showed a stronger variation of the r value. This is because that the {0 0 1}{1 1 0} texture, as revealed by the EBSD, significantly increased in the 0.5 mm sheet, which led to the decrease of r value and the increase of anisotropy (Delta r) and in turn the deterioration of deep drawing properties. An analytical model was established to correlate the microstructure evolution and the macroscopic r value. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The correlation of microstructure and mechanical properties was established by nanoindentation. A simplified scenario of weld formation was proposed. Nb weld metal was dominated by the coarse Laves phase (Fe2Nb) with high hardness (similar to 20.4 GPa). With the addition of Cu, sound weld metal was obtained with alternative distribution of alpha-Fe, Cu phases and fine eutectic phases (alpha-Fe + Fe2Nb). These transformation products with lower hardness (alpha-Fe + Fe2Nb similar to 11.6 GPa) improved the overall mechanical properties of the weld metal. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The application of three-dimensional (3D) printed scaffolds for tissue engineering have gained significant attention in recent years. The biological activity of scaffolds used in tissue engineering applications depends on fabricating high-resolution patterns with fiber orientation and scale. In this study, Bacterial Cellulose (BC) and Polycaprolactone (PCL) composite scaffolds with the line spacing of 100 mu m are produced using Electrohydrodynamic (EHD)-3D-bioprinting technique. The composite scaffolds exhibit enhanced biocompatibility with facilitated cell attachment and proliferation in vitro. The results of this work have demonstrated that EHD-3D-bioprinting method shows great potential for the preparation of BC/PCL composite scaffold and patterns for tissue engineering with enhanced bioactivity.

AB A new thermomechanical processing of warm rolling by a low deformation followed by annealing, which was specially developed for grain boundary (GB) engineering of large-size materials, was performed on a large-size 316 stainless steel. To examine usefulness of the thermomechanical process, the GB-networks before and after this process were quantitatively compared, and intergranular attack susceptibility was measured. Results clearly demonstrate that the GB-engineered 316 has higher proportions of coincidence site lattice boundaries, larger grain-clusters, longer twin boundary chains, and lower susceptibility to intergranular attack, indicating a successful process for GB-engineering. Additionally, a new parameter called twin boundary chain was proposed to evaluate the GB-network optimization. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID OF-CARE DIAGNOSTICS
AB Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) have been applied widely in clinical diagnosis, food safety, drug abuse, environmental monitoring and other fields due to their characteristics of rapidity, sensitivity, stability and low cost. Choosing the proper labels is key to the preparation of LFIAs. An ideal probe requires a simple synthesis, has stable performance and is economical. This study aimed to establish a simple, rapid and convenient method for the preparation of selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) that can be used as labels in LFIAs. Appropriate SeNPs were successfully prepared by reducing 2 mM H2SeO3 with 16 mM L-ascorbic acid (Vc), 5 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 100 mM polyethylene glycol (PEG) as stabilizing agents. The spherically formed and uniformly dispersed nanoparticles were applied to the preparation of an LFIA. In this study, the preparation of the SeNPs was economical and was accomplished at room temperature. We used clenbuterol (CLE) as an analyte in an LFIA; the limit of detection (LOD) of CLE in pig urine was found to be 3 ng/mL, which meets the industry standard and has the same sensitivity as commercially available flow assays. In addition, the SeNP-based LFIA can be stored at 37 degrees C for 60 days. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

HPT of the initial three-layer V-10Ti-5Cr alloy/Zr-2.5Nb alloy/V-10Ti-5Cr alloy billet resulted in a "mixing" of the zirconium alloy layer with vanadium alloy layers. A mixed nanostructure consisting of elongated grains (fragments) with a width of 40-50 nm was formed in the zirconium/vanadium alloy layers of the hybrid. Partial amorphization in the zirconium alloy layer of the hybrid material was found. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbonized hydrochars have been synthesized in this study, which could be matrix materials with low cost, simple fabrication process and high yield as the substitute of reduced graphene oxides (RGO) or carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The carbonized hydrochars in the coexistence of amorphous carbons and nanocrystalline graphite particles, exhibit excellent microwave absorption performance, and the minimum reflection loss value can reach up to -40.36 dB. Besides, we have confirmed the only one type of polarized center induced by atom dislocations from nanocrystallines graphite with poor crystallinity. The micro electric currents, induced by electrons migration in amorphous carbons regions, contribute to conduction loss, and result in strong microwave absorption. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Influence of tungsten (W) on the evolution of substructure during creep-fatigue interaction (CFI) and effect of loading mode in terms of continuous cycling (CC) and CFI at 823 K of reduced activation ferritic/martensitic (RAFM) steels has been investigated. Increase in W from 1.4 to 2 wt% resulted in an improvement of 1.6 times of CFI life. Electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis of CFI deformed specimens demonstrated that the subgrain size was 1.8 times smaller and boundary dislocation density was 3 times higher in case of 2 wt% W steel compared to 1.4 wt% W. It can be deduced that W addition resulted in decrease in the recovery rate and enhancing the CFI life. In context to loading mode, the subgrain size was 1.5 times higher and dislocation density was 2 times lower in case of CC tested specimen with respect to CFI tested. Under CFI, the number of cycles to failure were drastically reduced due to the synergistic damage of cyclic loading and creep deformation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multifactor lithographic process conditions have been achieved in order to fabricate 3-D single mode waveguide. One of the key factors is the heating (preheating and post-baking) process. Good waveguides were formed with 30 min of pre-heating at 100 degrees C. Sol gel waveguides have low light loss (0.16 dB/cm), which was achieved with an aged sol gel slab waveguide. By carefully controlling the index difference between cladding and core, light was easily launched into 4-inch lengths of single mode 3-D ridge waveguides. As the heating time increases, the luminescence intensities increase until 65 h and ceased further post-baking process at 110 degrees C. The thermally produced chromophore luminescence intensity was reduced about 10% after deep UV exposure for 12 min and no further reduction was observed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Martensitic transformation induced by strain in duplex stainless steels is a good option to increase their strength and elongation. The influence of low deformation levels on the phase transformation was studied in a 2304 lean duplex stainless steel. It was demonstrated that this steel exhibited the phase transformation of austenite (gamma) into epsilon (epsilon) and alpha (alpha') martensite after cold rolling. The epsilon and alpha' were observed in shear bands and close to the grain boundaries. The Shoji-Nishiyama relation < 110 >gamma/ /< 2110 >epsilon was observed. Hitherto, the epsilon formation has not been reported in the literature for this steel by cold deformation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A series of novel maleimide modified imidazole derivatives were successfully synthesized through the addition reaction between N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) maleimide (HPM) and imidazole compounds with 1-position N-H bond. The maleimide modified imidazole derivatives were blended with epoxy resin (EP) to evaluate their reactivity and thermal latency. Compared with the common EP/imidazoles systems, the curing exothermic interval of the EP systems containing maleimide modified imidazole derivatives shifted to higher temperature regions. Moreover, the EP systems containing maleimide modified imidazole derivatives had much longer pot life under room temperature. The enhanced latency of maleimide modified imidazole derivatives was attributed to the strong electron withdrawing effect of maleimide group, which reduced the nucleophilicity of imidazole moiety. Notably, the maleimide modified imidazole derivatives regained fast curing ability towards EP by overcoming the curing reaction energy barrier under heating condition. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Many small molecules of food origin may effect human health but lack an adequate description of their biological activity. To fill this knowledge gap, a first-line workflow is needed to assign putative functions, rank the endpoints for testing and guide wet-lab experiments. In this framework, the identification of potential biological targets can be used to probe the activity of orphan compounds using a so-called "target fishing" approach. Here, we present a proof of concept study using an in silico/in vitro target fishing approach on the fungal secondary metabolite atromentin. The procedure relies on a computational screening for activity identification coupled with experimental trials for dose-response characterization. Computational results identified estrogen receptors and 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase as potential targets. Experiments confirmed a weak estrogenic activity, supporting the reliability of the procedure. Despite limited estrogenicity of atromentin, the proposed inhibition of 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase should be considered as a source for endocrine disruptive effects.

AB In this work, changes in different physicochemical properties of iron-loaded double emulsions (DEs) were monitored under the influence of novel (microwave and ohmic) and conventional heat treatments. Microwave heating led to destabilization and obvious phase separation. As compared to control samples, heat treatment increased particle size, light absorbance, centrifugal instability, iron expulsion from the internal aqueous phase, color difference, chemical instability of the lipid phase, release of iron in simulated gastrointestinal fluids and iron bioavailability in cell line SW742. Emulsion viscosity and whiteness index decreased after heat treatment, whereas the zeta-potential remained unchanged. There was a negative correlation between physicochemical stability and heat treatment intensity. Conventional heating resulted in greater stability than ohmic heating. Yoghurt samples (as model systems) were fortified with either iron-loaded or iron-free DEs. Our results showed that the presence of iron in the aqueous phase resulted in significant lipid oxidation during storage.

AB Xylooligosaccharides (XOS) are prebiotic nutraceuticals that can be sourced from lignocellulosic biomass, such as agro-residues. This study reports for the first time an optimization study of XOS production from agro-residues by direct fermentation using two Trichoderma species. A total of 13 residues were evaluated as potential substrates for single-step production. The best results were found for Trichoderma reesei using brewers' spent grain (BSG) as substrate. Under optimal conditions (3 days, pH 7.0, 30 degrees C and 20 g/L of BSG), a production yield of 38.3 +/- 1.8 mg/g (xylose equivalents/g of BSG) was achieved. The obtained oligosaccharides were identified as arabino-xylooligosacharides (AXOS) with degree of polymerization from 2 to 5. One-step fermentation proved to be a promising strategy for AXOS production from BSG, presenting a performance comparable with the use of commercial enzymes. This study provides new insights towards the bioprocess integration, enabling further developments of low-cost bioprocesses for the production of these valuable compounds.

AB Free radical theory of aging hypothesizes that oxygen-derived radicals are responsible for the storage-related flavor instability in wine. In an optimal situation, a balanced-distribution exists between oxidants and antioxidants among wines intrinsic/extrinsic metabolites. Based on the kinetic study of POBN-1-hydroxyethyl spin adduct (POBN-1-HER) formation in wines initiated via the Fenton reaction, a novel tool based on EPR spin trapping methodology was developed to quantify wines resistance against oxidation. Antioxidant capacities of wines were evaluated according to POBN-1-HER maximum signal intensity (Imax POBN-1-HER) and rate formation (r(POBN-1-HER)) kinetic parameters. Low Imax POBN-1-HER and r(POBN-1-HER) values suggest that endogenous antioxidants in wine are able to quench a substantial amount of radicals capable to take part in deleterious oxidative reactions. This will be very valuable in understanding aging potential and will provide an avenue to better control the process by knowing how it might be possible to change wines resistance against oxidation.

AB Phenolic extracts from cv Tempranillo grapes subjected to water stress and irrigation treatment, both of them with high and low crop load, were analyzed by front-face fluorescence. Excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) were analyzed by means of unsupervised parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), PARAFAC supervised by linear discriminant analysis, and discriminant unfolded partial least-squares. All algorithms allowed to differentiate between water stress and irrigation grape samples when the fluorescence maxima region of catechin and epicatechin, and resveratrol was considered. A central composite design was employed for the calibration of catechin, epicatechin and resveratrol. Resveratrol was quantified by U-PLS in both, irrigated and water stressed samples, and levels between 3.46 +/- 0.22 and 4.67 +/- 0.08 mu g mL(-1) and 2.43 +/- 0.60 and 3.03 +/- 0.10 mu g mL(-1), respectively, were found. PARAFAC only allowed the determination of the sum of catechin plus epicatechin (R-2 = 0.9397). The determination of total catechin plus epicatechin by means of PARAFAC was successfully validated by liquid chromatography.

AB A multispectral model for the detection of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) changes in grass carp and salmon fillet was developed using physarum network and genetic algorithm (PN-GA) method for the first time. Partial least-squares regression (PLSR), multiple linear regressions (MLR), and principal component regression (PCR) algorithms were used to predict the DHA and EPA using optimal wavelengths selected by PN-GA. The MLR models showed the best DHA prediction results for both grass carp and salmon fillets, and also showed good prediction for EPA in grass carp fillet but poor prediction in salmon fillet. The MLR models were then applied for visualizing the spatial distribution of DHA and EPA changes in two fish fillets. The current results demonstrated that a developed multispectral imaging system could be feasibly constructed for DHA and EPA measurement in fish species with the optimal wavelengths selected by PN-GA method.

AB In the present study, composite egg white/gelatin hydrogels were produced and their porosity was increased through the subsequent removal of gelatin by leaching into water. The composite gel with 0.5% gelatin showed a higher degree of swelling than did the control gelatin-free sample after 60 min of immersion in an aqueous medium which was ascribed to the formation of capillary channels due to gelatin leaching. The composite gel containing 0.3% gelatin showed the highest water-holding capacity and firmness indices among all samples. Gel porosity decreased with increasing gelatin content. However, after gelatin depletion, higher concentrations of gelatin yielded hydrogels with higher porosity, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Based on Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, it was concluded that the count of hydrogen bonds decreased after gelatin depletion. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that intermolecular interaction between gelatin and egg white proteins had taken place in the amorphous phase.

AB Perchlorate (ClO4-) and bromate (BrO3-) are mainly determined by ion chromatography methods. The present work aims to develop a modified QuEChERS combined with ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for simultaneous analysis of ClO4- and BrO3- in fruits and vegetables including cherry tomato, strawberry, tomato, potato, lettuce and pakchoi. Two target inorganic anions were separated on a Diamonsil C18(2) column by gradient elution, scanned in ESI negative mode and detected under multiple reactions monitoring (MRM). Limit of detection (LOD) and method limit of quantification (MLOQ), matrix effect, accuracy and precision of the developed method were investigated. Results were linear in their concentration ranges, with coefficients of determination (r(2)) bigger than 0.999. LODs for ClO4- and BrO3- were 0.1 mu g/L and 0.5 mu g/L, respectively. The validated method provided sufficient selectivity, sensitivity and accuracy to screen for ClO4- and BrO3- with ignorable matrix effects. Recoveries for different kinds of negative samples at 3 spiked levels were between 82.0% and 99.5%. Both intraday-precision and interday-precision were satisfactory, showing RSDr values in the range of 2.1-7.1% and RSDR values in the range of 7.2-10.8%. The proposed method was successfully applied to determine target inorganic anions in several fruits and vegetables. Perchlorate was detected in 12 vegetable samples with the concentrations ranged from 21 mu g/kg to 162 mu g/kg. Results indicated that there was wide ClO4- contamination in vegetables, confirming its urgency for monitoring harmful inorganic anions in our daily consumed vegetables.

AB During the industrial refining process of edible oils and the manufacture of oil-based foodstuff, contaminants such as 3-monochloropropanediol (3-MCPD) fatty acid diesters can be produced. One hundred samples of different edible oils and related fatty food purchased from local Spanish markets were analyzed to evaluate the occurrence of these contaminants. Data of seven 3-MCPD diesters together with corresponding total 3-MCPD equivalents are presented. The procedure is based on a modified QuEChERS protocol followed by LC-MS/MS analysis. Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and unrefined oils did not contain detectable levels of the target analytes. The highest levels of 3-MCPD diesters were found in palm oils, for 1,2-Dilinoleoyl-3-chloropropanediol (LILI) and 1-2-Bispalmitoyl-3-chloropropanediol (PAPA) with concentrations close to 10 mg kg(-1) and in the lipid fraction of margarines (8.09, 3.77 and 3.72 mg kg(-1) for LILI, PAPA and 1-Oleoyl-2-linoleoyl-3-chloropropanediol (OLLI), respectively).

AB To provide stable and low-cost naturally derived yellow pigments, a variety of food byproducts were evaluated and the constituents of lemon peel have emerged yielding a highly promising natural product with applications as a food dye. Here we report a new, highly stable and water soluble food dye called yellow #15 from the ethanol extract of the zest of Citrus limon. The structure of lemon yellow #15 was carefully assigned on the basis of spectroscopic data, including 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, and the absolute configuration was established by comparison of the experimental CD with calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectral data. CIELAB values and Delta CIELAB were measured and revealed this new water-soluble pigment has superior light stability relative to other natural products used as food dyes.

AB A highly sensitive, selective method has been developed and validated for determination of capsiate and dihydrocapsiate for the first time using HPLC-ESI/MS(QTOF). For both capsinoids, LODs and LOQs were 0.02 and 0.05 mu mol/l, respectively. The intra- and interday repeatability values (RSD %) were 0.26-0.41% for retention time, and 2.25-2.11% for peak area. Recoveries were up to 98% and 97% for capsiate and dihydrocapsiate, respectively. This method was successfully applied to quantify capsiate and dihydrocapsiate in eight pepper fruit accessions. Capsinoids were found in the range of 1.21-544.59 mu g/gDW for capsiate and of 0.61-81.95 mu g/gDW for dihydrocapsiate. In the 'Tabasco' accession, capsiate and dihydrocapsiate were quantified for the first time, ranging from 3.09 to 58.76 and 1.80 to 6.94 mu g/g DW, respectively. Additionally, the ESI-MS/MS(QTOF) analysis has allowed the tentative identification of two other minor capsinoids by exact mass and fragmentation pattern, in the 'Bhut Jolokia' accession.

AB This work aims to investigate the structure-activity relationship for binding and activation of human estrogen receptor alpha ligand binding domain (hER alpha-LBD) with tanshinones by a combination of in vitro and in silico approaches. The recombinant hER alpha-LBD was expressed in E. coli strain. The direct binding interactions of tanshinones with hER alpha-LBD and their ER alpha agonistic potency were investigated by fluorescence polarization (FP) and reporter gene assays, respectively. FP assay suggested that the tested tanshinones can bind to hER alpha-LBD as affinity ligands. Tanshinones acted as agonists of hER alpha as demonstrated by transactivation of estrogen response element (ERE) in transiently transfected MCF-7 cells and by molecular docking of these compounds into the hydrophobic binding pocket of hER alpha-LBD. Interestingly, comparison of the calculated binding energies versus Connolly solvent-excluded volume and experimental binding affinities showed a good correlation. This work may provide insight into chemical and pharmacological characterization of novel bioactive compounds from Salvia miltiorrhiza.

AB PSE-like technological defect in the meat industry is of great importance due, to the economic loss it can cause. It has been studied from the biochemical perspective but very few studies have focused on tissular characterization. This study proposes innovative approaches that combine mechanistic elucidation and the discovery of potential biomarkers. This study focused on muscle destructuration using imaging and label-free quantitation. Oxidative stress and apoptotic processes were found to be linked to the specific evolution of the PSE-like destructuration zone, namely 'inner', within hams. Four m/z values were found to be related to the specific localization of the PSE-like defect, and a mass shift of 27 Da suggested a possible connection with oxidation. These potential markers of the PSE-like area in ham provide a new perspective to sort raw material based on the possible development of PSE-like areas.

AB In the present manuscript an analytical methodology for the simultaneous determination of ten mycotoxins and six pesticides in rice was developed. This methodology comprises the application of the dilute and shoot protocol followed by quantification via UHPLC-MS/MS. The methodology was validated and all figures of merit shown to be within the limits established by regulation. Hence, the recoveries for mycotoxins and pesticides were within the specified ranges. Precision was assessed by repeatability and intra-laboratory reproducibility with standard deviations smaller than or equal to 20%. The limits of detection, quantification and decision as well as the detection capacity were determined by the analytical curves whereas the measurement uncertainty was established by applying the bottom-up approach. Finally, the current methodology was applied to samples of rice (n = 42) commercialized in Brazil and positive results were found in only two for deoxynivalenol and zearalenone.

AB Traditional tomatoes are highly valued for their organoleptic quality and cultural links with a territory. At present, strong competition has put these crops at risk, and it is necessary to differentiate the local cultivars and improve their nutritional value.
   This work focused on the nutritional study of four selected lines of a local tomato grown in two locations and in two agronomic conditions to nutritionally characterize the tomatoes and to study the effect of location and cultivation on nutritional parameters.
   Data on nutritional characterization revealed significant effects of location and treatment in most compounds. Tomatoes grown in traditional areas showed a significantly higher concentration of some phenolic acids and beta-carotene. Lycopene contents were not location dependent. The open field test showed significant differences in all the components. Regarding the best nutritional genotypes, all the components were dependent on lines, and significant differences were confirmed between them.

AB We report a novel diffuse reflectance-Fourier transforms infrared (DRS-FTIR) spectral monitoring of fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin (CIP) and norfloxacin (NOR) for their quantification in poultry egg-yolks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the rapid quantitative determination of fluoroquinolone antibiotics in poultry egg samples using DRS-FTIR. The characteristic absorption peaks obtained at 1627 and 1026 cm(-1) were used for optimization and determination of CIP and NOR, respectively. The linearity range obtained for the determination of CIP and NOR in egg samples was 0.05-0.50 ng mL(-1) with limit of detection and limit of quantification of 0.032 and 1.551 ng mL(-1) and 0.028 and 0.194 ng mL(-1), respectively. Good recoveries were obtained in the range of 83.1-102.3% from poultry eggs samples using DRS-FTIR method. The advantages of the DRS-FTIR method are its simplicity, sensitivity and suitability for high-throughput analysis towards the food samples.

AB This study investigated the effects of cross-pollination by 'Murcott' tangor on the fruit quality of 'Qicheng52' navel orange, including the physicochemical properties, bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacities. There were no significant differences on the fruit weight, juice yield and pH value of juice between self- and cross-pollinated fruits. However, cross-pollination could significantly improve the fruit quality of 'Qicheng52' fruits by increasing the total soluble solid content from 11.12 +/- 1.02 degrees Brix to 13.86 +/- 1.17 degrees Brix. The results of high performance liquid chromatography analysis of three sugar components indicated that the increase of total sugar was mainly contributed by the increase of fructose and sucrose. Cross-pollination exhibited no effect on the flavonoids content, while the total phenolics content was increased from 210.09 +/- 18.55 mg/L to 298.25 +/- 29.10 mg/L, which contributed to the higher antioxidant capacity in the cross-pollination fruit juice.

AB Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and single-drop microextraction (SDME) in headspace mode, were used in the residual determination of the anesthetic 2-phenoxyethanol in fish fillets, to ensure food safety. For the optimization of the methodologies the experimental central composite design (CCD) was used, resulting in accurate evaluations with less amount of analysis. The developed methodologies presented good precision in the evaluated range, o limits of detection (LD) and quantification (LQ) for SDME were 0.2 and 0.62 mu g mL(-1) and for SPME were 0.18 and 0.56 mu g mL(-1), respectively. In the analyzed samples the determined elimination time of post-anesthesia 2-phenoxyethanol was 12 h for the SDME and 24 h for the SPME, at the anesthesia concentrations evaluated (450-1050 mu gmL(-1)). The two techniques presented viability of application for the residual determination of 2-phenoxyethanol in fish, SPME being more sensitive and automated and SDME with lower operation cost.

AB Mastication initiates digestion, disintegrating food structure and mixing it with saliva. This study aimed to provide understanding about the first step of bread digestion by exploring release of compounds from bread matrix during mastication. Furthermore, the aim was to identify compound groups that differentiate rye and wheat breads.
   Fifteen participants masticated whole-meal rye bread, endosperm rye bread, endosperm rye bread with added gluten and wheat bread. The masticated samples were studied with non-targeted LC-MS metabolic profiling.
   A great number of compounds were released from bread matrices in mastication, and the identified compounds differed largely between bread types. Specifically, rye bread samples were characterized by a greater release of peptides and amino acids, whereas sugars and nucleosides were characteristic for wheat bread. These compounds could potentially act as signal molecules in the alimentary tract and may explain, at least partly, the postprandial physiological effects of the breads identified in earlier studies.

AB An electroanalytical method was proposed to determine fat content in ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) processed milk by magnetoelectric induction. In the technique, involves the induction of a controllable voltage (potential difference, U-bc) in UHT milk, with differential magnetic fluxes as the stimulus. Results indicated that Ubc increased with an increase in the ratio difference between primary coil 1 and primary coil 2. Variation of fat content in the UHT milk induced a change in U-bc. A reduction in fat content led to an increase in lambda-value (ratio of U-ab to excitation voltage) under specific conditions. For calibration and verification, a high linear correlation coefficient (R-2 = 0.9428) and a low root-mean-square error of cross-validation (0.342 g/100 g) were observed between milk fat and lambda-value at 20 V and 700 Hz under an open circuit at a coil ratio of 14:56. Measurement sensitivity was improved with the increase of the sample coils.

AB This study was carried out to determine the effect of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and different storage temperatures on the keeping quality of modified atmosphere packed (MAP) peeled garlic cloves during storage at 0 degrees and 5 degrees C for 4 months. MeJA (10(-3) and 10(-5) molar) treatments were used to reduce postharvest quality losses. Color, SSC, total phenolics content and antioxidant activity were maintained by MeJA treatment and low temperature, both dose of MeJA showed the different behavior. Firmness and vitamin C notably decreased, higher weight loss and titratable acidity content were observed at 5 degrees C compare to the 0 degrees C. Allicin content was generally decreased at 5 degrees C during 4 months. And also, MeJA was not effective on allicin content. As a result, MeJA treated garlic cloves in MAP could be stored at 0 degrees C for up to 4 months or at 5 degrees C for up to 3 months.

AB Inhibition of Pacific white shrimp polyphenoloxidase (PPO) with Chamuang leaf extract (CLE) was studied. CLE was rich in polyphenolic glycosides, in which chrysoeriol 6-C-glucoside-8-C-arabinopyranoside and 2-feruloyl-L-sinapoylgentiobiose were dominant. It also contained organic acids including hydroxycitric acid and oxalosuccinic acid. CLE with copper chelation activity could inhibit PPO in a dose dependent manner. Shrimp treated with 1% CLE had the lower melanosis score than 1.25% sodium metabisulfite (SMS) treated shrimp and the control throughout the refrigerated storage of 12 days at 4 degrees C (P < 0.05). Lower total volatile base (TVB) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were detected in shrimp treated with 1% CLE, compared to others (P < 0.05). Lower counts of mesophile, psychrophile, Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae and H2S-producing bacteria were obtained with 1% CLE treatment than the control and SMS treated sample during entire storage. Thus, soaking of shrimps in 1% CLE solution effectively reduced melanosis and quality deterioration.

AB Cantaloupe melon carotenoids were encapsulated in porcine gelatin, whey protein isolate and concentrate by emulsification O/W to evaluate which agent could promote an increase in water solubility, and color stability in yogurt. The average particle size obtained was 59.3 (2.60) nm-161.0 (27.30) nm. Encapsulated crude extract in porcine gelatin presented the smallest size and polydispersity index [0.4 (0.04)], and showed sphericity, smooth surface and low agglomeration in SEM. These results associated to the good chemical interaction between the raw materials shown by FTIR, justify the increase in water solubility [0.072 (0.007) mg. mL(-1)] compared to the crude extract [0.026 (0.003) mg. mL(-1)]. The yogurt added with this nanoencapsulate remained stable for 60 days, unlike the crude extract. The results show that the nanoencapsulation using gelatin increased water solubility and the potential of application of melon carotenoids in food as natural dyes.

AB In this study, the function of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on the phenolic compounds accumulation and antioxidant system enhancement in germinated hulless barley under NaCl stress was investigated. Results showed that exogenous GABA induced the accumulation of phenolic compounds. It was observed that the activities and gene expression of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase (C4H), 4-coumarate coenzyme A ligase (4CL), p-coumaric acid 3-hdroxylase (C3H), caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) and ferulic acid 5-hydroxylase (F5H) which are involved in phenolics biosynthesis was up-regulated by NaCl stress plus GABA treatment. In addition, antioxidant enzymes activities were induced. However, these effects were suppressed by 3-mercaplopropionic acid (3-MP), an inhibitor of GABA synthesis. This inhibition could be alleviated partly by exogenous GABA. These results suggested that GABA was essential for mediating NaCl stress-induced phenolic compounds accumulation and the antioxidant system enhancement in germinated hulless barley.

ID ONLINE CONSUMER REVIEWS; TRUST; CONTEXT; SYSTEMS; MODEL
AB In this work, we analyse the potential problems emanating from solving the Multiway Polarity Classification task by mapping textual reviews to numerical ratings in On-line Review Systems. Traditionally, this task has been addressed by evaluating textual reviews with some sentiment analysis algorithm, and later on, mapping the output to a numerical rating. In this work, we empirically demonstrate how this perspective may potentially suffer from bias problems.
   With the objective of overcoming these problems, we put forward an approach based on building, what we have defined as Individual Reputation Rankings (IRRs) for each user. These rankings allow us to capture, directly from textual reviews, the preference relationships among the entities reviewed by the user. The main idea of our proposal is to bypass the construction of a preference recommendation based on a numerical rating; with the objective of incorporating a new way of building estimation of individual preferences. Then, we are able to better estimate the users' preferences by endowing ORSs with more accurate reputation rankings, allowing users to discover the best entities. Furthermore, our IRR based approach moves the traditional focus - where all the textual reviews are considered in the same way - to an individual focus - where the textual reviews of each user are addresses individually. It will allow us to try to improve the overall performance by using the most promising sentiment analysis algorithm for each individual user.
   Finally, we evaluate the suitability of the IRR-based approach by conducting some experiments in the domain of movie and Android based apps reviews with real datasets collected from the IMDb site and Amazon site, respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Existing studies using visible-light cameras have mainly focused on methods of pedestrian detection during daytime. However, these studies found it difficult to detect pedestrians during nighttime with low external light. The NIR illuminator has limitations in terms of illumination angle and distance, and the illuminator's power needs to be adjusted depending on whether an object is near or distant. Although, thermal cameras were used for nighttime pedestrian detection, thermal cameras are currently expensive and thus difficult to install in many places. To solve these problems, attempts have been made to use visible-light cameras for nighttime pedestrian detection. However, most of these attempts considered an indoor environment where the distance to the object was short. This study proposes a method of pedestrian detection at nighttime using a visible-light camera and faster region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN). In addition, as pedestrians cannot be reliably detected from a single nighttime image, we combined deep convolutional features in successive frames.
   Using Korea advanced institute of science and technology (KAIST) open database, we conducted experiments and observed that the proposed method performed better than the baseline methods at all times (day and night). In addition, through the experiments with national ICT Australia Ltd. (NICTA) open database, we confirm that the proposed method is effective for pedestrian detection at all times. Finally, we present theoretical grounds for the proposed fusion. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Feature selection has become an indispensable part of intelligent systems, especially with the proliferation of high dimensional data. It identifies the subset of discriminative features leading to better learning performances, i.e., higher learning accuracy, lower computational cost and significant model interpretability. This paper proposes a new efficient unsupervised feature selection method based on graph centrality and subspace learning called UGFS for 'Unsupervised Graph-based Feature Selection'. The method maps features on an affinity graph where the relationships (edges) between feature nodes are defined by means of data points subspace preference. Feature importance score is then computed on the entire graph using a centrality measure. For this purpose, we investigated the Google's PageRank method originally introduced to rank web-pages. The proposed feature selection method has been evaluated using classification and redundancy rates measured on the selected feature subsets. Comparisons with the well-known unsupervised feature selection methods, on gene/expression benchmark datasets, demonstrate the validity and the efficiency of the proposed method.

AB Fusion of feature descriptors extracted from a signal through different methods is an important issue for the exploitation of representational power of each descriptor. In this research work, a novel system which exploits multi-stage features from a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) and precisely combines these features with a selection of handcrafted features is proposed. The set of handcrafted features consists of three subsets namely, wavelet transform based morphological features representing localized signal behaviour, statistical features exhibiting overall variational characteristics of the signal and temporal features representing the signal's behaviour on the time axis. The proposed system utilizes a novel decision-level fusion of features for ECG classification by three different approaches; the first one uses normalized feature-level fusion of handcrafted global statistical and local temporal features by uniting these features into one set, the second one uses the morphological feature subset, and the third one combines features extracted from multiple layers of a CNN through using a score-level based refinement procedure. The main impact of the proposed approach is the score-level based fusion of automatically learned features extracted from multiple layers of trained CNN and the decision-level fusion of features characterising the signal in totally different representational spaces. The individual decisions of the three different classifiers are fused together based on the majority voting and a unified decision is reached for the input ECG signal classification. The results over the MIT-BIH arrhythmia benchmarks database exhibited that the proposed system achieves a superior classification accuracy compared to all of the state-of-the-art ECG classification methods.

AB This paper presents an investigation into the development of an intelligent mobile-enabled expert system to perform an automatic detection of tuberculosis (TB) disease in real-time. One third of the global population are infected with the TB bacterium, and the prevailing diagnosis methods are either resource-intensive or time consuming. Thus, a reliable and easy-to-use diagnosis system has become essential to make the world TB free by 2030, as envisioned by the World Health Organisation. In this work, the challenges in implementing an efficient image processing platform is presented to extract the images from plasmonic ELISAs for TB antigen-specific antibodies and analyse their features. The supervised machine learning techniques are utilised to attain binary classification from eighteen lower-order colour moments. The proposed system is trained off-line, followed by testing and validation using a separate set of images in real-time. Using an ensemble classifier, Random Forest, we demonstrated 98.4% accuracy in TB antigen-specific antibody detection on the mobile platform. Unlike the existing systems, the proposed intelligent system with real time processing capabilities and data portability can provide the prediction without any opto-mechanical attachment, which will undergo a clinical test in the next phase.

ID CATEGORIZATION; INFORMATION; SCHEME
AB Text classification automatically assigns text documents to one or more predefined categories based on their content. In text classification, data are characterized by a large number of highly sparse terms and highly skewed categories. Working with all the terms in the data has an adverse impact on the accuracy and efficiency of text classification tasks. A feature selection algorithm helps in selecting the most relevant terms. In this paper, we propose a new feature ranking metric called max-min ratio (MMR). It is a product of max-min ratio of the true positives and false positives and their difference, which allows MMR to select smaller subsets of more relevant terms even in the presence of highly skewed classes. This results in performing text classification with higher accuracy and more efficiency. To investigate the effectiveness of our newly proposed metric, we compare its performance against eight metrics (balanced accuracy measure, information gain, chi-squared, Poisson ratio, Gini index, odds ratio, distinguishing feature selector, and normalized difference measure) on six data sets namely WebACE (WAP, K1a, K1b), Reuters (RE0, RE1), and 20 Newsgroups using the multinomial naive Bayes (MNB) and support vector machines (SVM) classifiers. The statistical significance of MMR has been estimated on 5 different splits of training and test data sets using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) method and a multiple comparisons test based on Tukey-Kramer method. We found that performance of MMR is statistically significant than that of the other 8 metrics in 76.2% cases in terms of macro F(1 )measure and in 74.4% cases in terms of micro F-1 measure.

AB The main focus of this paper is the aggregation of local priorities into global priorities in the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. We study two most frequently used aggregation approaches - the weighted arithmetic and weighted geometric means - and identify their strengths and weaknesses. We investigate the focus of the aggregation, the assumptions made on the way, and the effect of different normalizations of local priorities on the resulting global priorities and their ratios. We clearly show the superiority of the weighted geometric mean aggregation over the weighted arithmetic mean aggregation in AHP for the purpose of deriving global priorities of alternatives. We also contribute to the literature on rank reversal in AHP. In particular, we show that a change of the normalization condition for the local priorities of alternatives may result in different ranking when the weighted arithmetic mean aggregation is used for deriving global priorities of alternatives, and we demonstrate that the ranking obtained by the weighted geometric mean aggregation is not normalization dependent. Moreover, we prove that the ratios of global priorities of alternatives obtained by the weighted geometric mean aggregation are invariant under the normalization of local priorities of alternatives and weights of criteria. We also propose three alternative approaches to aggregating preference information contained in local pairwise comparison matrices of alternatives into a global consistent pairwise comparison matrix of alternatives and prove their equivalence.

AB The increasing availability of large digitized fine art collections opens new research perspectives in the intersection of artificial intelligence and art history. Motivated by the successful performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for a wide variety of computer vision tasks, in this paper we explore their applicability for art-related image classification tasks. We perform extensive CNN fine-tuning experiments and consolidate in one place the results for five different art-related classification tasks on three large fine art datasets. Along with addressing the previously explored tasks of artist, genre, style and time period classification, we introduce a novel task of classifying artworks based on their association with a specific national artistic context. We present state-of-the-art classification results of the addressed tasks, signifying the impact of our method on computational analysis of art, as well as other image classification related research areas. Furthermore, in order to question transferability of deep representations across various source and target domains, we systematically compare the effects of domain-specific weight initialization by evaluating networks pre-trained for different tasks, varying from object and scene recognition to sentiment and memorability labelling. We show that fine-tuning networks pre-trained for scene recognition and sentiment prediction yields better results than fine-tuning networks pre-trained for object recognition. This novel outcome of our work suggests that the semantic correlation between different domains could be inherent in the CNN weights. Additionally, we address the practical applicability of our results by analysing different aspects of image similarity. We show that features derived from fine-tuned networks can be employed to retrieve images similar in either style or content, which can be used to enhance capabilities of search systems in different online art collections.

AB Face recognition becomes an important task performed routinely in our daily lives. This application is encouraged by the wide availability of powerful and low-cost desktop and embedded computing systems, while the need comes from the integration in too much real world systems including biometric authentication, surveillance, human-computer interaction, and multimedia management. Moreover, face recognition technology is now adopted in new intelligent systems and devices like smart-phones, which impose some constraints related to the complexity and execution time of the recognition process. This fact brings new challenges and gives much more area to extend the ongoing researches. This research field experienced the development of many methods and architectures aiming at producing face recognition systems which are efficient in terms of precision, robustness and computation time. In the same context, this article proposes a new feature descriptor referred to as Mixed Neighborhood Topology Cross Decoded Patterns (MNTCDP) as an effective face descriptor, The proposed handcrafted descriptor fulfills the needs of current face recognition applications and can be integrated in different platforms, requiring simple, robust and computationally low algorithms. Instead of heuristic code constructions, MNTCDP is built using new neighborhood topology and new pattern encoding scheme, which have high ability to extract discriminative and stable face representation. The adopted face recognition system consists of three stages: (1) face detection and alignment to normalize the input images to a common form if needed; (2) feature extraction using the proposed MNTCDP descriptor and (3) face recognition through a supervised image classification task using the simple K-Nearest Neighbors classifier. Simulated experiments on ORL, YALE, Extended Yale B, FERET and AR datasets acquired under different illumination conditions or facial expressions show that the proposed MNTCDP descriptor presents high performance ability in classifying face images. MNTCDP demonstrates superior performance than a large number of recent state-of-the-art LBP variants and deep learning methods, as well as recent most promising works of the literature.

AB Transit Network Design Problem is a multi-disciplinary problem that is considered one of the most intractable problems for real size networks. In the late 90s, Meta-heuristics started to prove more reliability to the problem. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is one of the popular Meta-heuristics which is usually implemented because it is simply adapted to the problem. In this study, GA is presented as a complete constructive multi-objective algorithm that creates its own routes from scratch then assembles the routes into efficient transit networks. Finally, it handles the multi-criteria nature of the problem until producing the optimal (near optimal) Pareto front solutions. A new frequency setting algorithm is also developed based on simulation results at the bus stop level which takes the bi-level decision making of both users and operators implicitly. Experimental studies on two real size networks are conducted to validate the methodology performance and robustness. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we consider a real life Vehicle Routing Problem inspired by the gas delivery industry in the United Kingdom. The problem is characterized by heterogeneous vehicle fleet, demand-dependent service times, maximum allowable overtime and a special light load requirement. A mathematical formulation of the problem is developed and optimal solutions for small sized instances are found. A new learning-based Population Variable Neighbourhood Search algorithm is designed to address this real life logistic problem. To the best of our knowledge Adaptive Memory has not been hybridized with a classical iterative memo-ryless method. In this paper we devise and analyse empirically a new and effective hybridization search that considers both memory extraction and exploitation. In terms of practical implications, we show that on a daily basis up to 8% cost savings on average can be achieved when overtime and light load requirements are considered in the decision making process. Moreover, accommodating for allowable overtime has shown to yield 12% better average utilization of the driver's working hours and 12.5% better average utilization of the vehicle load, without a significant increase in running costs. We also further discuss some managerial insights and trade-offs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Based on an expert systems approach, the issue of community detection can be conceptualized as a clustering model for networks. Building upon this further, community structure can be measured through a clustering coefficient, which is generated from the number of existing triangles around the nodes over the number of triangles that can be hypothetically constructed. This paper provides a new definition of the clustering coefficient for weighted networks under a generalized definition of triangles. Specifically, a novel concept of triangles is introduced, based on the assumption that, should the aggregate weight of two arcs be strong enough, a link between the uncommon nodes can be induced. Beyond the intuitive meaning of such generalized triangles in the social context, we also explore the usefulness of them for gaining insights into the topological structure of the underlying network. Empirical experiments on the standard networks of 500 commercial US airports and on the nervous system of the Caenorhabditis elegans support the theoretical framework and allow a comparison between our proposal and the standard definition of clustering coefficient.

AB In electronic commerce, online reviews play very important roles in customers' purchasing decisions. Unfortunately, malicious sellers often hire buyers to fabricate fake reviews to improve their reputation. In order to detect deceptive reviews and mine the topics and sentiments from the reviews, in this paper, we propose an unsupervised topic-sentiment joint probabilistic model (UTSJ) based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. This model first employs Gibbs sampling algorithm to approximate parameters of maximum likelihood function offline and obtain topic-sentiment joint probabilistic distribution vector for each review. Secondly, a Random Forest classifier and a SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier are trained offline, respectively. Experimental results on real-life datasets show that our proposed model is better than baseline models such as n-grams, character n-grams in token, POS (part-of-speech), LDA, and JST (Joint Sentiment/Topic). Moreover, our UTSJ model outperforms or performs similarly to benchmark models in detecting deceptive reviews over balanced dataset and unbalanced dataset in different domains. Particularly, our UTSJ model is good at dealing with real-life unbalanced big data, which makes it very suitable for being applied in e-commerce environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB People use online social networks to exchange information, spread ideas, learn about innovations, etc. Thus, it is important to know how information spreads through social networks. It is possible to spread information (e.g., product advertisement) to a larger number of individuals via a social network. Similarly, it is possible to minimize the spread of unwanted content (e.g., 'false news'). The key point in both cases is to identify the most influential individuals on the social network. This problem is named as Influence Maximization (IM) problem. The IM problem focuses on finding the small subset of individuals in a social environment who influence a certain group of individuals, i.e., maximize/minimize the spreading of information. Some greedy algorithms, stochastic algorithms and evolutionary optimization algorithms have been developed to find a solution to this problem. However, these methods are not at the desired level in terms of speed or solution capability. On the other hand, although many swarm intelligence algorithms that produce fast and optimal solutions can be found in the literature, these algorithms cannot be directly applied to the IM problem because no general slope is produced on the state-space surface of the IM problem's objective function. Swarm intelligence algorithms follow the general slope over the surface to converge at the global optimum. Thus, they cannot converge to the global optimum in the IM problem.
   In this study, a change in the structure of the IM problem is suggested in order to tailor it to swarm intelligence algorithms and to achieve a general slope on the state-space surface of its objective function. We named this process as "reshaping". More precisely, if a social network is envisioned as a graph and individuals as nodes, reshaping means sorting the nodes in descending order (from largest to smallest) according to the metrics under consideration (i.e., metrics that give an idea about the level of influence of an individual) and renumbering the nodes according to this order. Thus, the nodes those are close to each other in terms of level of influence become closer to each other in the state-space. This creates a general slope on the state-space surface of the objective function. This simple idea paves the way for applying all swarm intelligence algorithms to this kind of problem. The proposed approach was tested with real and synthetic graphs. The experiments employed the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) as the swarm intelligence algorithms and PageRank and Kempe et al.'s Greedy Algorithm as benchmark methods. Experimental results showed that this approach worked well. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To ensure the rational allocation of software testing resources and reduce costs, software defect prediction has drawn notable attention to many "white-box" and "black-box" classification algorithms. Although there have been lots of studies on using software product metrics to identify defect-prone modules, defect prediction algorithms are still worth exploring. For instance, it is not easy to directly implement the Apriori algorithm to classify defect-prone modules across a skewed dataset. Therefore, we propose a novel supervised approach for software defect prediction based on atomic class-association rule mining (ACAR). It holds the characteristics of only one feature of the antecedent and a unique class label of the consequent, which is a specific kind of association rules that explores the relationship between attributes and categories. It holds the characteristics of only one feature of the antecedent and a unique class label of the consequent, which is a specific kind of association rules that explores the relationship between attributes and categories. Such association patterns can provide meaningful knowledge that can be easily understood by software engineers. A new software defect prediction model infrastructure based on association rules is employed to improve the prediction of defect-prone modules, which is divided into data preprocessing, rule model building and performance evaluation. Moreover, ACAR can achieve a satisfactory classification performance compared with other seven benchmark learners (the extension of classification based on associations (CBA2), Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayesian, Decision Tree, OneR, K-nearest Neighbors and RIPPER) on NASA MDP and PROMISE datasets. In light of software defect associative prediction, a comparative experiment between ACAR and CBA2 is discussed in details. It is demonstrated that ACAR is better than CBA2 in terms of AUC, G-mean, Balance, and understandability. In addition, the average AUC of ACAR is increased by 2.9% compared with CBA2, which can reach 81.1%. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Perceptual signals such as acoustic or visual cues carry a massive amount of information. From a human perspective, this problem is solved by means of cognitive mechanisms related to attention. In particular, saliency is a property of particular stimuli that makes them stand from others to allow the brain to take decisions about their relevance in the process of exploring the world.
   For artificial intelligence systems it is advantageous to mimic these mechanisms. Visual saliency algorithms have been successfully employed in tasks such as medical diagnosis, detection of violent scenes, environment understanding made by robots, etc. In contrast, computational models of the acoustic saliency mechanisms are less extended. In this context, we propose a novel acoustic saliency algorithm to be used by intelligent and expert systems facing tasks such as sound detection and classification, early alarm, surveillance, robotic exploration of the surroundings, among many other applications.
   This technique, we termed echoic log-surprise, combines an unsupervised statistical approach based on Bayesian log-surprise and the biological concept of echoic or Auditory Sensory Memory. Our algorithm computes several independent log-surprise cues in parallel considering a wide range of memory values, with the aim of leveraging saliency information from different temporal scales. Then, we explore several statistical metrics to combine these multi-scale signals in a single temporal saliency signal including Renyi entropy, Jensen-Shannon divergence, Cramer or Bhattacharyya distances. We have adopted Acoustic Event Detection tasks as adequate proxies to test its performance. Results show that the proposed echoic log-surprise method outperforms classical acoustic detection techniques commonly deployed in intelligent and expert systems, such as energy thresholding or voice activity detection, and it also achieves better results than some other state-of-the-art acoustic saliency algorithms, such as Kalinli's and conventional log-surprise.

AB Sentiment knowledge extraction is a growing area of research in the literature. It helps in analyzing users' opinions about different entities or events, which can then be utilized by analysts for various purposes. Particularly, feature-based sentiment analysis is one of the challenging research areas that analyzes users' opinions on various features of a product or service. Of the three formats for the product reviews, our focus in this paper is limited to analyzing the pros/cons type. Due to the nature of pros/cons reviews, they are mostly concise and follow a different structure from other review types. Therefore, specialized techniques are needed to analyze these reviews and extract the customers' discussed product features along with their personal attitudes. In this paper, we propose the Pros/Cons Sentiment Analyzer (PCSA) framework that exploits dependency relations in extracting sentiment knowledge from pros/cons reviews. We also utilize two different lexicons to ascertain the polarity strength of the extracted features based on the customers' opinions. Several experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of PCSA in its different phases. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a combined approach of circular Hough transform and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms was proposed for detecting exudates, which is one of the signs of diabetic retinopathy disease. The proposed approach was assessed using DiaretDB0, DiaretDB1 and DrimDB public datasets. This approach consists of visual enhancement with basic pre-processing methods, the segmentation of the OD with the help of circular Hough transformation to ignore the optical disc (OD) regions from the image, and the CNN-based exudate detection system to automatically detect the exudates in the retinal image. In pre-processing and segmentation of the OD region step, adaptive histogram equalization, Canny edge detection algorithm and circular Hough conversion methods are applied respectively to improve retinal images and prevent interference with OD, which is an anatomical region. The images obtained by segmenting and discarding the OD are trained with CNN and subjected to binary classification as exudated and exudate-free image. Then, the method developed with the images not included in the training set was found to have a correct classification ratio of 99.17% in DiaretDB0, 98.53% in DiaretDB1 and 99.18% in DrimDB. This suggests that the results of the proposed approach are more successful than the results obtained using CNN-only or image processing methods alone. Finally, it is seen that the proposed method that applying CNN to the output image of the image processing result, is more successful than the other methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Imperceptibility, capacity, robustness and security are four basic requirements of any watermarking technique. A new blind image watermarking technique based on the redundant discrete wavelet transform (RDWT) and singular value decomposition (SVD) is presented in this paper to satisfy all of these four watermarking requirements simultaneously. The gray-scale watermark image is directly embedded into the singular values of RDWT sub-bands after multiplying by a scaling factor. The self-adaptive differential evolution (SADE) algorithm is used to optimize the scaling factor values with the aim of reaching the highest possible robustness while guaranteeing a pre-determined watermarked image quality. By the use of human visual system (HVS) characteristics, an 8-bits digital signature is inserted into the watermarked image to solve the false positive problem which is a prevalent security problem for the most SVD-based watermarking methods. The digital signature is used for verification test before initialization of the watermark extraction procedure. Also, considering the existing redundancy in the RDWT domain, the scheme attained a large amount of capacity. Experimental results demonstrate that in addition to achieving a great imperceptibility, large capacity and sufficient security, the proposed scheme obtains a satisfactory level of robustness against image processing and geometrical attacks, simultaneously.

AB Brain disease such as brain tumor, Alzheimer's disease, etc. is a major public health problem, and the main cause of death worldwide. Expert systems are gaining much attention in the medical image analysis field for the clinical treatment and follow up study. Traditional sparse representation based classifiers use a random subset in a limited range. It suffers from the problem of repetition of the training samples which may prevent obtaining optimal subset having all variations. To overcome this problem, nested cross-validation based adaptive sparse representation algorithm is newly proposed. The novelty of the work are: (i) a novel strategy for optimal subset selection, (ii) adaptively selects an optimal subset, (iii) ability to overcome the problems like overfitting, underfitting and bias results, (iv) better accuracy in all variations of training samples, and (v) newly applied to pathological brain classification problem. The proposed system is based on a hybrid methodology of feature selection followed by classification. The gray level co-occurrence matrix is used to extract the spatial texture feature vectors of the brain MRI samples. The nested cross-validation based adaptive sparse representation algorithm is used for classification. It uses a nested cross-validation technique to obtain the optimal value of the subset size (N) based on maximum classification accuracy. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SENTIMENT ANALYSIS INTRODUCTION; TOPICS
AB As the rapid development of Web 2.0 communities, social media service providers offer users a convenient way to share and create their own contents such as online comments, blogs, microblogs/tweets, etc. Understanding the latent emotions of such short texts from social media via the computational model is an important issue as such a model will help us to identify the social events and make better decisions (e.g., investment in stocking market). However, it is always very challenge to detect emotions from above user-generated contents due to the sparsity problem (e.g., a tweet is a short message). In this article, we propose an universal affective model (UAM) to classify readers' emotions over unlabeled short texts. Different from conventional text classification model, the UAM structurally consists of topic-level and term-level sub-models, and detects social emotions from the perspective of readers in social media. Through the evaluation on real-world data sets, the experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of the effectiveness and accuracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Speech-music discrimination using deep visual feature extractors
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DE CNNs; Speech-music discrimination; Transfer learning; Audio analysis
AB Speech music discrimination is a traditional task in audio analytics, useful for a wide range of applications, such as automatic speech recognition and radio broadcast monitoring, that focuses on segmenting audio streams and classifying each segment as either speech or music. In this paper we investigate the capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with regards to the speech - music discrimination task. Instead of representing the audio content using handcrafted audio features, as traditional methods do, we use deep structures to learn visual feature dependencies as they appear on the spectrogram domain (i.e. train a CNN using audio spectrograms as input images). The main contribution of our work focuses on the potentials of using pre-trained deep architectures along with transfer-learning to train robust audio classifiers for the particular task of speech music discrimination. We highlight the supremacy of the proposed methods, compared both to the typical audio-based and deep-learning methods that adopt handcrafted features, and we evaluate our system in terms of classification success and run-time execution. To our knowledge this is the first work that investigates CNNs for the task of speech music discrimination and the first that exploits transfer learning across very different domains for audio modeling using deep-learning in general. In particular, we fine-tune a deep architecture originally trained for the Imagenet classification task, using a relatively small amount of data (almost 80 min of training audio samples) along with data augmentation. We evaluate our system through extensive experimentation against three different datasets. Firstly we experiment on a real-world dataset of more than 10 h of uninterrupted radio broadcasts and secondly, for comparison purposes, we evaluate our best method on two publicly available datasets that were designed specifically for the task of speech-music discrimination. Our results indicate that CNNs can significantly outperform current state-of-the-art in terms of performance especially when transfer learning is applied, in all three test-datasets. All the discussed methods, along with the whole experimental setup and the respective datasets, are openly provided for reproduction and further experimentation. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper addresses the hybrid flow shop scheduling problem to minimise makespan, a well-known scheduling problem for which many constructive heuristics have been proposed in the literature. Nevertheless, the state of the art is not clear due to partial or non homogeneous comparisons. In this paper, we review these heuristics and perform a comprehensive computational evaluation to determine which are the most efficient ones. A total of 20 heuristics are implemented and compared in this study. In addition, we propose four new heuristics for the problem. Firstly, two memory-based constructive heuristics are proposed, where a sequence is constructed by inserting jobs one by one in a partial sequence. The most promising insertions tested are kept in a list. However, in contrast to the Tabu search, these insertions are repeated in future iterations instead of forbidding them. Secondly, we propose two constructive heuristics based on Johnson's algorithm for the permutation flowshop scheduling problem. The computational results carried out on an extensive testbed show that the new proposals outperform the existing heuristics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Investor sentiment has been shown as an important factor that influences market returns, and a number of profitable trading systems have been proposed by taking advantage of investor sentiment signals. In this paper, we aim to design an investor sentiment reward-based trading system using Gaussian inverse reinforcement learning method. Our hypothesis is that while markets interact with investor's sentiment, there exists an intrinsic mapping between investor's sentiment and market conditions revealing future market directions. We propose an investor sentiment reward based trading system aimed at extracting only signals that generate either negative or positive market responses. Such a reward extraction mechanism is based not only on market returns but also market volatility representing a succinct and robust feature space. The back-test results show that the proposed sentiment reward-based trading system is superior to various benchmark strategies on S&P 500 index and market-based ETFs as well as few other existing news sentiment-based trading signals. Moreover, we find that sentiment reward trading system is much more effective in a volatile market, but it is sensitive to transaction costs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   electrocorticographic data; Multi-way data; Hand movement prediction
AB The paper addresses the problem of designing Brain-Computer Interfaces. It investigates feature selection methods in regression, applied to ECoG-based motion decoding. The problem is to predict hand trajectories from the voltage time series of cortical activity. A special characteristic of this problem is the inherently multi-way structure of feature description. The feature description resides in spatial-spectratemporal domain and includes the voltage time series and their spectral representation. Since electrocorticographic data is highly correlated in temporal, spectral and spatial domains, redundancy of the feature space as well as its dimensionality become a major obstacle for robust solution of the regression problem both in multi-way and flat cases. Feature selection reduces dimensionality and increases model robustness. It plays the crucial role in obtaining adequate predictions.
   The main contribution of this paper is the following. We propose a filtering feature selection for multi-way data. The proposed method extends quadratic programming feature selection (QPFS) approach. QPFS selects a subset of features by solving a quadratic problem. It incorporates estimates of similarity between features and their relevance to the regression problem. QPFS offers an effective way to leverage similarities between features and their importance. Our modification allows to apply QPFS to multi-way data. By taking the multi-way structure of features into account, the proposed modification reduces computational costs of optimization problem in QPFS. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that the proposed modification improves prediction quality of resultant models. The proposed method is model-free and provides interpretable results, which makes it relevant for knowledge extraction and domain analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Automatic sleep staging is challenging since several issues need to be addressed. Traditional approaches from literature do not satisfy medical experts since they do not reflect the cognitive process they perform when scoring polysomnographic curves. We propose a new approach that is based on the implementation of medical knowledge by symbolic fusion. Medical knowledge coming from the international clinical practice guidelines for sleep medicine is formalized as a five-layer framework dedicated to data abstraction in order to deliver local and global propositions and support the interpretation of polysomnographic curves. Firstly, features are extracted from raw curves. Then these features are combined to recognize sleep events in accordance with guidelines. Sleep events are then fused into the criteria required to recognize the different sleep stages. Sleep is not homogeneous through the night. The physiological events observed during the night follow a dynamic that needs to be included into an automatic sleep staging system. In order to take this into account, decision rules are selected and applied to recognize a sleep stage according to the current context. Thereby, transitions are considered with interest. In this paper, we propose to use a Turing Machine-like decision process to handle transitions. To interpret the local observations and properly score a given state, the previous state which has been stored in a specific register is used as a context. One of the advantages of following the principles of symbolic fusion is to benefit from the full traceability of the decision. Hence, it makes possible to discuss each final - or intermediate - decision with an expert and check for relevance. The preliminary results are encouraging since agreement rates provided between decisions taken by our automatic approach and human experts are similar to those measured between human experts (average agreement rate = 54.60% / average Cohen's kappa = 0.40) on a dataset of 131 full polysomnographic recordings.

AB Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has attracted the attention of scientific and clinical community because of its application in control, early care, and treatment. The development of a cost-effective but reliable method is a challenge in this field. To address this challenge, in this study an effort was made to represent an efficient algorithm based on the analysis of handwriting data. Detection of premonitory symptoms using the handwriting data could be more difficult due to individual differences, effects of different sources of variability and noises. For this purpose, a noise-robustness paradigm was adopted that was independent of small variations. It was based on the singular value decomposition technique and sparse non-negative least-square classifier. To find out the best results, the effects of single and dual-task conditions as well as several handwriting time series such as horizontal, vertical and absolute velocity, acceleration, pressure, and trajectory curvature were studied.
   The discriminant capability of the proposed method was studied in 13 subjects with mild cognitive impairment, 15 with AD, and 15 healthy participants. They performed four writing tasks under single and dual task conditions. The new feature extracted from vertical acceleration yielded high average accuracy rates of 100% in classification between healthy controls and subjects with MCI. The average accuracy rate of 93.5% was also obtained in discriminating between healthy controls and AD patients. More investigations confirmed that using the proposed features under dual-task condition could enhance the detection rate. Achieving high performance using a relatively simple and cost-effective method demonstrated that it could potentially be used in clinical devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There are approaches that successfully recognize activities of daily living by using a trained classifier on feature vectors created from binary sensor data. Although these approaches have been successful, there are still open issues such as the evaluation of multiple temporal windows, ensembles of classifiers or unbalanced classes which need to be addressed in order to improve the performance of the real-time activity recognition process. In this paper, we present a methodology for Real-Time Activity Recognition based on the diverse fields of Machine Learning, including Fuzzy Logic and Recurrent Neural Networks. The methodology uses a long-term and short-term representation of binary-sensor activations based on Fuzzy Temporal Windows. The paper proposes an ensemble of activity-based classifiers for the purposes of balanced training, where each classifier in the ensemble is a Long Short-Term Memory. The approach was evaluated using two binary-sensor datasets of daily living activities and benchmarked against previous approaches based on the combination of sensor activation features.

AB Automatic fruit picking is a challenging problem in robotics with a wide application field. A prerequisite for realization of a robotic fruit picker is its ability to detect fruits in tree tops. An expert system, which would be able to compete with human perception, must be capable of recognizing fruits among leaves and branches under uncontrolled conditions, where fruits are occluded and shaded. In this paper, a novel approach for fruit recognition in RGB-D images based on detection and classification of convex surfaces is proposed. The input RGB-D image is first segmented into convex surfaces by a region growing procedure. Each convex surface is then described by an appropriate descriptor and classified with the aid of the associated descriptor. A novel descriptor of approximately convex surfaces is proposed, which we named Convex Template Instance (CTI) descriptor. It is based on approximating surfaces by convex polyhedrons with quantized face orientations, where every polyhedron face corresponds to one descriptor component. Computation of the proposed descriptor is simple and can be performed very efficiently. The proposed CTI descriptor is compared to the SHOT descriptor, a standard descriptor for 3D point clouds. Two variants of the both CTI and SHOT descriptor are evaluated, a variant which uses color and a variant which does not. A k-nearest neighbor classifier is used to classify detected surfaces into two classes: fruit and other. The main advantage of the proposed expert system in comparison to other fruit recognition solutions is its computational efficiency, which is of great importance for its target application - an automatic fruit picker. The proposed approach is evaluated using a challenging dataset containing RGB-D images of four fruit sorts acquired under uncontrolled conditions, which has been made publicly available to the scientific community, allowing benchmarking of novel fruit recognition methods.

AB Depleting natural resources and limited amount of landfill areas have forced many governments to impose stricter measures on environmental performance. In order to comply with those measures and to have a better environmental image, companies are investing heavily in environmental, social and economic responsibility issues. Moreover, they continuously track the environmental performance of their suppliers. Many green supplier evaluation and ranking methodologies were proposed in the literature in order to assist companies in the environmental performance evaluation of suppliers. However, the number of studies on the sorting of suppliers based on environmental criteria is very limited. In this study, we fill this research gap by proposing a novel VIKOR-based green supplier sorting methodology called VIKORSORT. This methodology evaluates the environmental performance of suppliers and sorts them into the predefined ordered classes. The proposed methodology can easily be embedded into an expert system which can suggest a suitable green supplier development program for each class. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Data dependencies in databases and attribute dependencies in decision systems are important when addressing problems concerning data quality and attribute reduction, in which measures play a significant role in approximating these dependencies to achieve better adaptation to uncertain data. This paper proposes a differential-relation-based rough set model from the perspective of relational databases to express the dependency degree, error measures, confidence, information granulation and differential class distance for differential dependencies (DDs) and the relationships among them in a unified framework. Moreover, the error measure g(3) has been widely studied and applied for data dependencies. However, the computation of g(3) for DDs is NP-complete. Therefore, based on the proposed rough set, we introduce a new method that can compute the approximate error measure (g(3)) over tilde of g(3) in polynomial time. This study demonstrates that our approach can provide a substantially better approximation, that is, an approximation closer to the optimal solution g(3), compared to the existing greedy method. We also introduce the differential-relation-based rough set from the perspective of information systems and make a connection to the rough sets induced by non-equivalence relations. The two views of the differential-relation-based rough sets form an essential bridge between the DDs in databases and attribute dependencies in differential decision systems (DDSs) that allows sharing measures for approximating the dependencies. These results are meaningful for approximate computations, the development of algorithms for attribute reduction in decision systems and the discovery of approximate differential dependencies (ADDs) in databases.

ID TOPIC DETECTION
AB Event detection over microblogs has attracted great research interest due to its wide application in crisis management and decision making etc. In natural disasters, complex events are reported in real time on social media sites, but these reports are invisible to crisis coordinators. Detecting these crisis events helps watchers to make right decisions rapidly, reducing injuries, deaths and economic loss. In sporting activities, detecting events helps audiences make better and more timely game viewing plans. However, existing event detection techniques are not effective at handling complex social events that evolve over time. In this paper, we propose an event detection method that takes advantage of retweeting behavior for handling the events evolution. Specifically, we first propose a topic model called RL-LDA to capture the social media information over hashtag, location, textual and retweeting behavior. Using RL-LDA, a complex event can be well handled by exploring the correlation between retweeting behavior and the event. Then to maintain the RL-LDA in a dynamic environment, we propose a dynamic update algorithm, which incrementally updates events over real time streams. Experiments over real-world datasets show that RL-LDA detects the temporal evolution of complex events effectively and efficiently. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present an extension to the single-query sampling-based algorithm for improving its response time using Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) technique. Unlike traditional experience-based planners, CBR depends on a single thread execution which reduces the required computation power. Additionally, it is always biased towards exploration rather than exploitation to overcome experience-based algorithms drawbacks. Results indicate that CBR extension has significantly improved sampling-based response time for similar served queries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Goal: To develop and implement a Deep Learning (DL) approach for an electroencephalogram (EEG) based Motor Imagery (MI) Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system that could potentially be used to improve the current stroke rehabilitation strategies.
   Method: The DL model is using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers for learning generalized features and dimension reduction, while a conventional Fully Connected (FC) layer is used for classification. Together they build a unified end-to-end model that can be applied to raw EEG signals. This previously proposed model was applied to a new set of data to validate its robustness against data variations. Furthermore, it was extended by subject-specific adaptation. Lastly, an analysis of the learned filters provides insights into how such a model derives a classification decision.
   Results: The selected global classifier reached 80.38%, 69.82%, and 58.58% mean accuracies for datasets with two, three, and four classes, respectively, validated using 5-fold crossvalidation. As a novel approach in this context, transfer learning was used to adapt the global classifier to single individuals improving the overall mean accuracy to 86.49%, 79.25%, and 68.51%, respectively. The global models were trained on 3s segments of EEG data from different subjects than they were tested on, which proved the generalization performance of the model.
   Conclusion: The results are comparable with the reported accuracy values in related studies and the presented model outperforms the results in the literature on the same underlying data. Given that the model can learn features from data without having to use specialized feature extraction methods, DL should be considered as an alternative to established EEG classification methods, if enough data is available.
